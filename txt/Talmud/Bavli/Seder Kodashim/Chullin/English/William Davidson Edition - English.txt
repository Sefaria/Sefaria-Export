Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Everyone slaughters</b> an animal, i.e., can perform halakhically valid slaughter, <b>and their slaughter is valid, except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, lest they ruin their slaughter</b> because they lack competence. <b>And</b> for <b>all of them, when they slaughtered</b> an animal <b>and others see</b> and supervise <b>them, their slaughter is valid.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> There is an apparent contradiction between the first two phrases of the mishna. The <i>tanna</i> begins: <b>Everyone slaughters</b> an animal, indicating that their performing slaughter is permitted <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> and then teaches: <b>And their slaughter is valid,</b> indicating that their slaughter is valid only <b>after the fact.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: And</b> does <b>every</b> use of the term: <b>Everyone,</b> indicate that the action in question is permitted <b><i>ab initio</i>? If that is so,</b> in the mishna (<i>Temura</i> 2a), where it says: <b>Everyone substitutes</b> a non-sacred animal for a sacrificial animal, <b>both men and women, is</b> that <b>also</b> an expression indicating <b>that</b> it is permitted <b><i>ab initio</i>? But isn’t it written: “He shall neither exchange it, nor substitute it, good for bad, or bad for good”</b> (Leviticus 27:10)?
Rav Ashi answers: <b>There, the reason</b> the mishna uses the word everyone is <b>that it</b> immediately <b>teaches:</b> That is <b>not</b> to say <b>that it is permitted for a person to substitute; rather,</b> it means <b>that if one did substitute</b> a non-sacred animal for a sacrificial animal, <b>substitution takes effect, and</b> the one who substituted the non-sacred animal <b>incurs [<i>vesofeg</i>] the forty</b> lashes that are the punishment for violating the prohibition “Nor substitute it.” But here, since the mishna does not similarly qualify its statement, it indicates that everyone may perform the slaughter <i>ab initio</i>.
Rav Aḥa challenges: <b>But</b> a mishna teaches (<i>Arakhin</i> 2a): <b>Everyone takes</b> vows of <b>valuation</b> and is thereby obligated to donate to the Temple treasury the value fixed by the Torah based on the age and gender of the person valuated; <b>and</b> everyone <b>is valuated,</b> and therefore one who vowed to donate his fixed value is obligated to pay; everyone <b>vows</b> to donate the market value of a person as a slave to the Temple treasury and is thereby obligated to pay; <b>and</b> everyone is the object of <b>a vow</b> if others vowed to donate his market value. Is that <b>also</b> an expression indicating <b>that</b> it is permitted <b><i>ab initio</i>? But it is written: “And if you shall cease to vow, there shall be no sin in you”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:23), indicating that it is preferable not to vow.
<b>And it is written: “It is better that you should not vow, than that you should vow and not pay”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:4); <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to that verse: <b>Better than</b> both <b>this</b> one, who vows and does not pay, <b>and that</b> one, who vows and pays, is <b>one who does not take a vow at all;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: Better than</b> both <b>this</b> one, who vows and does not pay, <b>and that</b> one, who does not vow at all, is <b>one who vows and pays</b> in fulfillment of that vow. Rav Aḥa comments: <b>And even Rabbi Yehuda states</b> his opinion <b>only in</b> a case where one vows and <b>says: This</b> animal <b>is</b> designated for sacrifice, as in that case there is no concern that he will fail to fulfill his commitment, since even if the animal is stolen or lost, he is not required to bring another in its place.

Daf 2b

<b>But</b> in the case of one who vows and <b>says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring an offering, even Rabbi Yehuda concedes that <b>no,</b> it is best not to vow at all. Likewise, it is preferable not to vow to donate a certain monetary value to the Temple treasury. Apparently, then, the statements in that mishna: Everyone takes vows of valuation, and: Everyone vows to donate the assessment of a person to the Temple treasury, do not indicate that it is permitted to do so <i>ab initio</i>.
Rav Ashi responded: <b>And</b> is that to say that <b>every</b> use of the term: <b>Everyone,</b> is an indication that the action in question <b>is not</b> permitted <b><i>ab initio</i>? Rather,</b> is the term: Everyone, in the <i>baraita</i> that states: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>,</b> and in the <i>baraita</i> that states: <b>Everyone is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes, also</b> an indication <b>that</b> they are <b>not</b> permitted <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b>
Rav Aḥa answered: <b>I am not speaking</b> about cases where it is stated: Everyone is <b>obligated,</b> as it goes without saying that fulfilling any obligation is permitted <i>ab initio</i>. Rav Ashi asked: <b>If that is so,</b> that which was stated: <b>Everyone</b> who brings an offering <b>places hands</b> on the animal, <b>both men and women</b> (see <i>Menaḥot</i> 93a), is that <b>also</b> an expression indicating <b>that</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted <b><i>ab initio</i>? But isn’t it written: “And he shall place his hand</b> upon the head of the burnt offering, <b>and it shall be accepted</b> for him to effect atonement for him” (Leviticus 1:4)?
Rav Aḥa answered: <b>Indeed, there are</b> instances where the word: <b>Everyone,</b> indicates <b><i>ab initio</i>, and there are</b> instances where the word: <b>Everyone,</b> indicates <b>after the fact. Rather,</b> concerning the term: <b>Everyone, that</b> appears <b>here</b> in the mishna, <b>from where</b> can it be determined <b>that it is</b> an expression indicating that it is permitted <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> creating an apparent contradiction in the mishna <b>that will be difficult for you? Perhaps</b> it is an expression indicating that everyone’s slaughter is valid <b>after the fact, and</b> there will <b>not</b> be a contradiction in the mishna that <b>will be difficult for you.</b>
Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Aḥa: <b>I</b> find the phrase: <b>And their slaughter is valid,</b> to be <b>difficult for me. From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: And their slaughter is valid,</b> which is an expression indicating that it is valid <b>after the fact,</b> conclude <b>by inference that</b> the initial phrase in the mishna: <b>Everyone</b> slaughters, <b>is</b> an expression indicating that it is permitted <b><i>ab initio</i>. As, if</b> it indicated that it is valid <b>after the fact, why do I</b> need <b>two</b> phrases teaching that it is valid <b>after the fact?</b>
<b>Rabba bar Ulla said,</b> in resolution of the conflict in the mishna, that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching: Everyone slaughters, and even a ritually impure</b> person may slaughter <b>a non-sacred</b> animal <i>ab initio</i>. The Gemara interjects: <b>What</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> that <b>a ritually impure</b> person may slaughter <b>a non-sacred</b> animal <i>ab initio</i>? There is no prohibition against rendering non-sacred meat impure. The Gemara answers that the reference is <b>to non-sacred</b> animals <b>that were</b> being <b>prepared according to</b> the strictures of <b>sacrificial</b> food, <b>and</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that the halakhic status of <b>non-sacred</b> foods <b>that were prepared according to</b> the strictures of <b>sacrificial</b> food is <b>like</b> that of <b>sacrificial</b> food insofar as it is prohibited to render such food impure.
The Gemara asks: <b>How does</b> an impure person <b>act</b> in order to ensure that he will not render the flesh of the slaughtered animal impure? The Gemara answers: <b>He brings a long knife and slaughters</b> the animal <b>with it, so that he will not come into contact with the flesh</b> of the slaughtered animal.
Rabba bar Ulla continues his interpretation of the mishna: <b>And</b> the reason the mishna also indicates that he may not slaughter <i>ab initio</i> is that <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, <b>he may not slaughter</b> them <i>ab initio</i> even with a long knife, <b>lest he come into contact with the flesh. But if he slaughtered</b> the sacrificial animal <b>and says:</b> It is <b>clear to me that I did not come into contact</b> with the flesh, <b>his slaughter is valid</b> after the fact.
And it teaches: This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all people <b>except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, who, even</b> if they slaughtered <b>only non-sacred</b> animals, their slaughter is <b>not</b> valid <b>even after the fact.</b> The reason the Sages deemed such slaughter not valid is <b>lest</b> people in these categories <b>interrupt</b> the slaughter, <b>lest they press</b> the knife in the course of slaughter, <b>and lest they conceal</b> the knife beneath the windpipe or the gullet in the course of an inverted slaughter.
The Gemara asks: If so, with regard to the clause that follows in the mishna: <b>And any of them who slaughtered</b> an animal and others see and supervise them, their slaughter is valid, <b>to which</b> case in the mishna is it referring? <b>If we say</b> that the reference is to the case <b>of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor,</b> why was it formulated: And any of them who slaughtered? Since <b>it stands adjacent</b> to that <i>halakha</i>, the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> formulated the phrase: <b>And if they slaughtered. Rather,</b> perhaps the reference is to the case <b>of a ritually impure</b> person who slaughtered <b>a non-sacred</b> animal. The Gemara rejects that possibility as well. <b>But didn’t you say</b> in that case: <b>He slaughters</b> the animal <b>even <i>ab initio</i>?</b>
<b>And rather,</b> perhaps the reference is to the case <b>of a ritually impure</b> person who slaughtered <b>a sacrificial</b> animal. The Gemara rejects that possibility, as <b>in</b> that case, if the ritually impure person says: It is <b>clear to me</b> that I did not come into contact with the flesh, it is <b>sufficient,</b> and there is no need for supervision. The Gemara answers: Supervision is necessary in the case of a ritually impure person who slaughtered a sacrificial animal, to account for a case <b>where</b> the ritually impure person <b>is not before us</b> so <b>that we</b> can <b>ask him</b> whether he came into contact with the flesh.
The Gemara asks: Is <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b>a ritually impure</b> person who slaughtered <b>a sacrificial</b> animal <b>learned from</b> an analysis of the mishna <b>here?</b> It is <b>learned</b> explicitly <b>from</b> the mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 31b): With regard to <b>all</b> those <b>who are unfit</b> for Temple service <b>who slaughtered</b> an offering, <b>their slaughter is valid, as the slaughter</b> of an offering <b>is valid</b> <i>ab initio</i> when performed even <b>by non-priests, by women, by</b> Canaanite <b>slaves, and by ritually impure</b> individuals. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even with</b> regard to <b>offerings of the most sacred order, provided that the ritually impure will not touch the flesh</b> of the slaughtered animal, thereby rendering it impure.
The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>here</b> is the <b>primary</b> source. <b>There, since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught the rest of</b> those <b>disqualified</b> for Temple service, <b>he taught</b> the case of <b>a ritually impure</b> person who slaughtered <b>a sacrificial</b> animal <b>as well. And if you wish, say</b> instead that the mishna <b>there</b> is the <b>primary</b> source, as it <b>is standing</b> in tractate <i>Zevaḥim</i>, <b>which</b> deals <b>with sacrificial</b> animals. <b>Here, since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the case of <b>a ritually impure</b> person who slaughtered <b>a non-sacred</b> animal, <b>he also teaches</b> the case of <b>a ritually impure</b> person who slaughtered <b>a sacrificial</b> animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>This ritually impure</b> person mentioned in the mishna is one <b>who became impure with what</b> form of impurity? <b>If we say that he became impure with</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse,</b> this is difficult, as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And whosoever in the open field touches <b>one slain with a sword”</b> (Numbers 19:16).

Daf 3a

It is derived from the juxtaposition of “slain” to “sword” that the halakhic status of <b>a sword</b> or any other metal vessel that comes into contact with a corpse <b>is like</b> that of <b>a corpse</b> itself. Similarly, if a metal utensil comes in contact with a person impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, it assumes his status. Therefore, since the impure person <b>is a primary source of ritual impurity, let him render the knife impure,</b> rendering it as well a primary source of impurity, <b>and the knife</b> then <b>goes and renders the flesh impure.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the person <b>became impure with</b> impurity imparted by <b>a creeping animal;</b> as he assumes first-degree ritual impurity status and does not render vessels impure, the knife remains ritually pure. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that actually he became impure with</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse, and</b> it is a case <b>where one examined the stalk of a reed,</b> which is a flat wooden vessel that does not become ritually impure, to ensure that it is perfectly smooth with no nicks, <b>and slaughtered with it, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may slaughter</b> an animal <b>with any</b> sharp object, <b>whether with a flint, or with glass</b> shards, <b>or with the stalk of a reed.</b>
§ <b>Abaye said</b> in resolution of the apparent contradiction in the mishna <b>that this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching: Everyone slaughters, and even a Samaritan. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where a Jew is standing over him</b> and ensuring that he slaughters properly; <b>but</b> if the Jew merely <b>exits and enters</b> and does not have a constant presence, the Samaritan <b>may not slaughter</b> the animal.
<b>And if</b> the Samaritan <b>slaughtered</b> the animal without supervision, the Jew <b>cuts an olive-bulk of meat</b> from the slaughtered animal <b>and gives it to</b> the Samaritan to eat. If the Samaritan <b>ate it,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for the Jew <b>to eat</b> meat <b>from</b> what the Samaritan <b>slaughtered.</b> Since Samaritans are meticulous with regard to the meat that they eat and eat meat only from an animal that was slaughtered properly, the Jew may partake of the meat. But if the Samaritan <b>did not eat</b> the meat, there is concern that the animal was not slaughtered properly, and it is <b>prohibited to eat from</b> what the Samaritan <b>slaughtered.</b>
And it teaches: This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all people <b>except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, who,</b> even if they slaughtered only non-sacred animals, their slaughter is <b>not</b> valid <b>even after the fact.</b> The reason the Sages deemed such slaughter not valid is <b>lest</b> people in these categories <b>interrupt</b> the slaughter, <b>lest they press</b> the knife in the course of slaughter, <b>and lest they conceal</b> the knife beneath the windpipe or the gullet in the course of an inverted slaughter.
The Gemara asks: If so, with regard to the clause in the mishna that follows: <b>And any of them who slaughtered</b> an animal and others see and supervise them, their slaughter is valid, <b>to which</b> case in the mishna is it referring? <b>If we say</b> that the reference is to the case <b>of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor,</b> since that is the <i>halakha</i> to which <b>it stands adjacent,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> formulated the phrase: <b>And if they slaughtered,</b> instead of: And any of them who slaughtered.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps the reference is to the case <b>of a Samaritan</b> who slaughters. The Gemara rejects that possibility. <b>But didn’t you say</b> in that case: <b>When a Jew is standing over him,</b> a Samaritan may <b>slaughter even <i>ab initio</i>?</b> The Gemara concedes that the formulation of the mishna: And any of them who slaughtered, is <b>difficult</b> according to this explanation of the mishna.
<b>Rava said: And</b> in a case where a Jew <b>exits and enters,</b> is it <b>not</b> permitted for the Samaritan to slaughter the animal <b><i>ab initio</i>? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Avoda Zara</i> 69a): In the case of <b>one who leaves a gentile in his store</b> in which there is wine, <b>and a Jew exits and enters,</b> the wine is <b>permitted?</b> Just as there, the sporadic presence of the Jew is sufficient to ensure that the gentile will refrain from touching the wine, it should be sufficient in the case of a Samaritan who slaughters an animal as well. The Gemara rejects that proof. <b>There,</b> in the case of the store, <b>does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach: One leaves</b> a gentile <i>ab initio</i>? The <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: One who leaves, after the fact.</b> Consequently, there is no proof from there that the Jew’s sporadic presence is sufficient to permit slaughter by a Samaritan <i>ab initio</i>.
<b>Rather,</b> proof can be cited <b>from</b> the mishna <b>here</b> (<i>Avoda Zara</i> 61a): In a case where barrels of wine belonging to a Jew are in the possession of a gentile, and a Jew was tasked with supervising those barrels, <b>the supervisor need not be</b> continuously <b>sitting and supervising</b> to ensure that the gentile does not touch the wine; <b>rather, even if</b> the supervisor <b>exits and enters,</b> the wine is <b>permitted.</b> This mishna clearly indicates that exiting and entering is sufficient even <i>ab initio</i>.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> in resolution of the apparent contradiction similar to the resolution proposed by Abaye, that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching: Everyone slaughters, and even a Samaritan. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where a Jew exits and enters; but</b> if the Jew does not exit and enter and instead <b>came and found that</b> the Samaritan <b>slaughtered</b> the animal, the Jew <b>cuts an olive-bulk of meat</b> from the slaughtered animal <b>and gives it to</b> the Samaritan to eat. If the Samaritan <b>ate it,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for the Jew <b>to eat</b> meat <b>from</b> what the Samaritan <b>slaughtered.</b> But if the Samaritan <b>did not eat</b> the meat, it is <b>prohibited to eat from</b> what the Samaritan <b>slaughtered.</b>
And it teaches: This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all people <b>except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, whose</b> slaughter is <b>not</b> valid <b>even after the fact.</b> The reason the Sages deemed such slaughter not valid is <b>lest</b> people in these categories <b>interrupt</b> the slaughter, <b>lest they press</b> the knife in the course of slaughter, <b>and lest they conceal</b> the knife beneath the windpipe or the gullet in the course of an inverted slaughter. The Gemara asks: If so, with regard to the clause in the mishna that follows: <b>And any of them who slaughtered</b> an animal and others see and supervise them, their slaughter is valid, <b>to which</b> case in the mishna is this referring? <b>If we say</b> that the reference is to the case <b>of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor,</b> since that is the <i>halakha</i> to which <b>it stands adjacent,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> formulated the phrase: <b>And if they slaughtered,</b> instead of: And any of them who slaughtered.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps the reference is to the case <b>of a Samaritan</b> who slaughters. The Gemara rejects that possibility. <b>But didn’t you say</b> that if a Jew is present, then <b>even</b> if he <b>exits and enters</b> and does not have a constant presence, a Samaritan may <b>slaughter even <i>ab initio</i>?</b> The Gemara concedes that the formulation of the mishna: And any of them who slaughtered, is <b>difficult</b> according to this explanation of the mishna.
§ <b>Rav Ashi said</b> in resolution of the apparent contradiction in the mishna that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching: Everyone slaughters, and even a Jewish transgressor [<i>meshummad</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>A transgressor of what</b> sort? The Gemara answers: It is one whose transgression is <b>to eat</b> unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses to</b> satisfy his <b>appetite,</b> i.e., for his convenience. <b>And</b> the ruling of the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rava, as Rava says:</b> In the case of <b>a Jewish transgressor</b> whose transgression is that he <b>eats</b> unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses to</b> satisfy his <b>appetite,</b> if he seeks to slaughter an animal,

Daf 3b

<b>one examines a knife</b> to ensure that it is perfectly smooth with no nicks <b>and gives it to</b> the transgressor, <b>and</b> it is <b>permitted to eat from</b> what <b>he slaughtered. But if one did not examine</b> the knife <b>and give it to</b> the transgressor, the transgressor <b>may not slaughter</b> an animal <i>ab initio</i>. <b>And if</b> the transgressor <b>slaughtered</b> an animal, <b>one examines his knife after his</b> slaughter. If <b>his knife is found</b> to be <b>perfectly</b> smooth, it is <b>permitted to eat</b> meat <b>from</b> what <b>he slaughtered, and if not,</b> it is <b>prohibited to eat from</b> what <b>he slaughtered.</b>
And it teaches: This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all people <b>except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, whose</b> slaughter is <b>not</b> valid <b>even after the fact.</b> The reason the Sages deemed such slaughter not valid is <b>lest</b> people in these categories <b>interrupt</b> the slaughter, <b>lest they press</b> the knife in the course of slaughter, <b>and lest they conceal</b> the knife beneath the windpipe or the gullet in the course of an inverted slaughter. The Gemara asks: If so, with regard to the clause in the mishna that follows: <b>And any of them who slaughtered</b> an animal and others see and supervise them, their slaughter is valid, <b>to which</b> case in the mishna is it referring? <b>If we say</b> that the reference is to the case <b>of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor,</b> since that is the <i>halakha</i> to which <b>it stands adjacent,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> formulated the phrase: <b>And if they slaughtered,</b> instead of: And any of them who slaughtered.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps the reference is to the case <b>of a Jewish transgressor</b> who slaughters. The Gemara asks: In what case? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where one examined a knife and gave it to</b> the transgressor, <b>didn’t you say</b> in that case that the transgressor <b>may slaughter <i>ab initio</i>? Rather,</b> perhaps the reference is to a case <b>where one did not examine</b> the knife. <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where the knife is</b> available, <b>let him examine</b> the knife <b>now</b> to make sure that there are no nicks. <b>And if</b> it is a case <b>where the knife is not</b> available, then <b>when others see him</b> slaughter, <b>what of it?</b> How can one eat from what he slaughtered? <b>Perhaps he slaughtered the animal with a notched knife.</b> The Gemara concedes that the formulation of the mishna: And any of them who slaughtered, is <b>difficult</b> according to this explanation of the mishna.
§ <b>Ravina said</b> in resolution of the apparent contradiction in the mishna <b>that this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching: Everyone slaughters,</b> i.e., <b>everyone</b> who is <b>an expert</b> in the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual slaughter <b>slaughters;</b> all <b>experts</b> are qualified to slaughter, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if they are not established</b> as accustomed to slaughter with a steady hand and without fainting.
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where</b> people <b>know about him that he knows</b> and is able <b>to recite the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual slaughter. But if</b> people <b>do not know about him that he knows</b> and is able <b>to recite the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual slaughter, he may not slaughter</b> an animal <i>ab initio</i>. <b>And if he slaughtered</b> an animal, <b>one examines him; if he knows</b> and is able <b>to recite the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual slaughter</b> it is <b>permitted to eat</b> meat <b>from</b> what <b>he slaughtered, and if not,</b> it is <b>prohibited to eat from</b> what <b>he slaughtered.</b>
And it teaches: This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all people <b>except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, whose</b> slaughter is <b>not</b> valid <b>even after the fact.</b> The reason the Sages deemed such slaughter not valid is <b>lest</b> people in these categories <b>interrupt</b> the slaughter, <b>lest they press</b> the knife in the course of slaughter, <b>and lest they conceal</b> the knife beneath the windpipe or the gullet in the course of an inverted slaughter. The Gemara asks: If so, with regard to the clause in the mishna that follows: <b>And any of them who slaughtered</b> an animal and others see and supervise them, their slaughter is valid, <b>to which</b> case in the mishna is this referring? <b>If we say</b> that the reference is to the case <b>of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor,</b> since that is the <i>halakha</i> to which <b>it stands adjacent,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> formulated the phrase: <b>And if they slaughtered,</b> instead of: And any of them who slaughtered.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps the reference is <b>to</b> a case <b>where they are not experts.</b> The Gemara rejects the possibility that they are not experts, as in that case, if <b>one examines him</b> after the slaughter to determine his expertise in the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual slaughter, it is <b>sufficient.</b> The Gemara answers: Supervision is necessary in the case where the one who slaughtered the animal <b>is not before us</b> so <b>that we</b> can <b>examine him.</b>
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Ravina said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching: Everyone slaughters,</b> i.e., <b>everyone</b> who is <b>established</b> as accustomed to slaughter with a steady hand and without fainting <b>slaughters;</b> all those <b>established</b> concerning this are qualified to slaughter, <b>even</b> if it is <b>not</b> known if <b>they are experts. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where they slaughtered before us two or three times and did not faint. But if he did not slaughter before us two or three times he may not slaughter</b> an animal <i>ab initio</i>, <b>lest he faint. And if he slaughtered</b> an animal <b>and said: It is clear to me that I did not faint, his slaughter is valid.</b>
And it teaches: This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all people <b>except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, whose</b> slaughter is <b>not valid even after the fact.</b> The reason the Sages deemed such slaughter not valid is <b>lest</b> people in these categories <b>interrupt</b> the slaughter, <b>lest they press</b> the knife in the course of slaughter, <b>and lest they conceal</b> the knife beneath the windpipe or the gullet in the course of an inverted slaughter. The Gemara asks: If so, with regard to the clause in the mishna that follows: <b>And any of them who slaughtered</b> an animal and others see and supervise them, their slaughter is valid, <b>to which</b> case in the mishna is this referring? <b>If we say</b> that the reference is to the case <b>of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor,</b> since that is the <i>halakha</i> to which <b>it stands adjacent,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> formulated the phrase: <b>And if they slaughtered,</b> instead of: And any of them who slaughtered.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps the reference is <b>to</b> a case <b>where they are not established</b> as accustomed to slaughter with a steady hand and without fainting. The Gemara rejects that possibility, as in that case, <b>didn’t you say</b> that if one said after the slaughter: <b>It is clear to me</b> that I did not faint, it is <b>sufficient?</b> The Gemara answers: Supervision is necessary in the case <b>where</b> the one who slaughtered the animal <b>is not before us</b> so <b>that we</b> can <b>ask him</b> whether he fainted.
The Gemara summarizes: <b>Ravina and Rabba bar Ulla did not say</b> a resolution to the apparent contradiction in the mishna <b>like</b> that of <b>Abaye, Rava, and Rav Ashi due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the phrase in the mishna: <b>And any of them who slaughtered,</b> is <b>difficult for them.</b>
<b>All of</b> the other <i>amora’im</i> <b>did not say</b> a resolution to the apparent contradiction in the mishna <b>like</b> that of <b>Rabba bar Ulla,</b> who interprets the mishna as referring to the case of a ritually impure person; <b>according to that version that you said:</b> The mishna <b>here</b> is the <b>primary</b> source for the <i>halakha</i> of a ritually impure person who slaughtered a sacrificial animal, the other <i>amora’im</i> reject this interpretation because, <b>on the contrary,</b> the mishna <b>there</b> is the <b>primary</b> source, <b>as it is standing in</b> tractate <i>Zevaḥim</i>, which deals with <b>sacrificial</b> animals.
The <i>amora’im</i> also reject the interpretation <b>according to that</b> other <b>version that you said:</b> The mishna <b>there</b> is the <b>primary</b> source, <b>and here, since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the case of <b>a ritually impure</b> person who slaughtered <b>non-sacred</b> animals, <b>he teaches</b> the case of <b>a ritually impure</b> person who slaughtered <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>as well.</b> The reason is that it <b>was not necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to teach the case <b>itself</b> of <b>a ritually impure</b> person who slaughtered <b>a non-sacred</b> animal, as in the opinion of the other <i>amora’im</i>, the halakhic status of <b>non-sacred</b> foods <b>that were prepared according to</b> the strictures of <b>sacrificial</b> food is <b>not like</b> that of <b>sacrificial</b> food, and it is permitted to render such food impure.
<b>All of</b> the other <i>amora’im</i> <b>did not say</b> a resolution to the apparent contradiction in the mishna <b>like</b> that of <b>Ravina; according to that version that he said: Experts, yes,</b> may slaughter <i>ab initio</i>, but those <b>that</b> it is <b>not</b> known that they are <b>experts, no,</b> they may not slaughter <i>ab initio</i>, the other <i>amora’im</i> disagree because they hold that <b>the majority</b> of those <b>associated with slaughter are experts.</b> Therefore, even if it is not known whether they are experts, their slaughter is valid.
<b>According to that version that</b> Ravina <b>said:</b> People who are <b>established</b> as accustomed to slaughter without fainting, <b>yes,</b> they may slaughter <i>ab initio</i>, but people who are <b>not established</b> as accustomed to slaughter without fainting, <b>no,</b> they may not slaughter <i>ab initio</i>, the other <i>amora’im</i> disagree because they hold that <b>we are not concerned for</b> the possibility of <b>fainting.</b>
<b>Rava did not say</b> a resolution <b>like</b> that of <b>Abaye,</b> that the mishna is referring to a Samaritan, <b>in accordance with</b> the <b>difficulty</b> that <b>he</b> raised from the <i>halakha</i> of wine belonging to a Jew to which a gentile has access. <b>Abaye did not say</b> a resolution <b>like</b> that of <b>Rava,</b> that a Samaritan may slaughter <i>ab initio</i> if a Jew enters and exits, because <b>there,</b> in the case of wine, the gentile <b>does not touch</b> the wine; therefore, it is sufficient if the Jew enters and exits. <b>Here,</b> in the case of slaughter, the Samaritan <b>touches</b> the animal in the course of slaughter, and he can disqualify the slaughter in an instant. Therefore, Abaye holds that it is insufficient for a Jew to enter and exit.
<b>Rav Ashi did not say</b> a resolution <b>like</b> that of <b>both of them,</b> Abaye and Rava, because <b>he holds: Samaritans are converts</b> who converted under duress due to the threat posed by <b>lions,</b> and their conversion is void; therefore, their halakhic status is that of a gentile, whose slaughter is not valid.
<b>Abaye did not say</b> a resolution <b>like</b> that of <b>Rav Ashi,</b> who interprets the mishna as referring to a Jewish transgressor whose transgression is that he eats unslaughtered animal carcasses to satisfy his appetite, because <b>he does not hold that which Rava</b> said, that such a transgressor may slaughter <i>ab initio</i> if his knife is examined beforehand by someone reliable. <b>But</b> as for <b>Rava, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not say</b> a resolution <b>in accordance with his</b> own statement of <b><i>halakha</i></b> with regard to the slaughter of a transgressor and explain the mishna in the manner that Rav Ashi did?
The Gemara answers: When Rava explained that the <i>tanna</i> in the mishna is referring to the slaughter of a Samaritan, <b>he stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with the statement of Abaye</b> in order to resolve the difficulty that Abaye raised; <b>but he himself does not hold accordingly.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The slaughter</b> performed by <b>a Samaritan is permitted</b> <i>ab initio</i>. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where</b> there is <b>a Jew standing over him</b> and supervising to ensure that the slaughter was performed properly. <b>But</b> if the Jew <b>came and found that</b> the Samaritan already <b>slaughtered</b> the animal, the Jew <b>cuts an olive-bulk</b> of meat from the slaughtered animal <b>and gives it to</b> the Samaritan to eat. If the Samaritan <b>ate it,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for the Jew <b>to eat</b> meat <b>from</b> what the Samaritan <b>slaughtered. But if</b> the Samaritan <b>did not</b> eat the meat, it is <b>prohibited to eat from</b> what the Samaritan <b>slaughtered.</b>
<b>Similarly,</b> if the Jew <b>found in the possession of</b> a Samaritan

Daf 4a

<b>a string [<i>dekurya</i>] of birds,</b> and the Jew does not know whether they were properly slaughtered, <b>he severs the head of one of them and gives it to</b> the Samaritan to eat. If the Samaritan <b>ate it,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for the Jew <b>to eat</b> the meat <b>from</b> what the Samaritan <b>slaughtered. But if</b> the Samaritan did <b>not</b> eat the meat, it is <b>prohibited to eat from</b> what the Samaritan <b>slaughtered.</b>
In arriving at their respective interpretations of the mishna, <b>Abaye inferred from the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> and <b>Rava inferred from the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Abaye inferred from the first clause:</b> The slaughter performed by a Samaritan is permitted in a case where there is a Jew actively supervising to ensure that the slaughter was performed properly, that <b>the reason</b> it is permitted is <b>that the Jew is standing over him. But</b> if the Jew <b>exits and enters,</b> then <b>no,</b> it is prohibited to eat from what the Samaritan slaughtered.
<b>Rava inferred from the latter clause:</b> If the Jew came and found that the Samaritan already slaughtered the animal, the Jew cuts an olive-bulk of meat from the slaughtered animal and gives it to the Samaritan to eat. <b>The reason</b> that it is necessary to administer this test is due only to the fact <b>that</b> the Jew <b>came and found that</b> the Samaritan already <b>slaughtered</b> the animal. <b>But</b> in a case where the Jew <b>exits and enters,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to eat from what the Samaritan slaughtered <i>ab initio</i>.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>And according to Abaye, the latter clause</b> is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara answers that Abaye could have <b>said to you:</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>also characterizes</b> the case where a Jew <b>exits and enters</b> as a case of: If the Jew <b>came and found</b> the Samaritan. The Gemara raises an objection: <b>And according to Rava, the first clause</b> is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara answers that Rava could have <b>said to you:</b> The case where a Jew <b>exits and enters</b> is <b>also</b> considered <b>like</b> a case where the Jew <b>is standing over him,</b> and it is included in that <i>halakha</i>.
§ The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Similarly,</b> if the Jew <b>found a string of birds in the possession of</b> a Samaritan, and the Jew does not know whether they were properly slaughtered, <b>he severs the head of</b> one of them and gives it to the Samaritan to eat. If the Samaritan ate it, it is permitted for the Jew to eat from what the Samaritan slaughtered. But if the Samaritan did not eat the meat, it is prohibited to eat from what the Samaritan slaughtered. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is that a reliable indication? <b>Let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> it <b>is this</b> bird alone, whose head the Jew severed, <b>that</b> the Samaritan <b>slaughtered properly,</b> and the rest are unslaughtered carcasses.
<b>Rav Menashe said</b> an answer to this question. Before presenting his answer, the Gemara cites <b>a mnemonic</b> for the three statements of Rav Menashe cited in this tractate, this one and two others: <b>Inserts, a scalpel</b> (see 31a), <b>into rams</b> (see 51a). Rav Menashe’s answer is as follows: The case in the <i>baraita</i> is one <b>where</b> the Jew <b>inserts</b> the string of birds <b>under the corners of his garment</b> and hands the Samaritan the head of one of the birds. In that way, the Samaritan has no way of knowing from which bird the head was taken. If he ate it, apparently all the birds were slaughtered properly.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And perhaps</b> the Samaritan <b>placed a distinguishing mark in</b> that bird, indicating to him that it is the kosher one. <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said:</b> The case in the <i>baraita</i> is one <b>where</b> the Jew <b>crushed</b> the head that he gave the Samaritan, thereby rendering it indistinguishable from the others.
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>And perhaps the Samaritans hold there is no</b> source for the <b>slaughter of a bird in the Torah.</b> Therefore, the fact that the Samaritan ate the bird’s head is no proof that the bird was properly slaughtered.
The Gemara rejects that possibility: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> those actions that disqualify the slaughter of an animal: <b>Interrupting</b> the slaughter, <b>pressing</b> the knife, <b>concealing</b> the knife in the course of an inverted slaughter, <b>diverting [<i>hagrama</i>]</b> the knife from the place of slaughter, <b>and ripping</b> the <i>simanim</i> from their place before cutting them, <b>are they written</b> in the Torah?
<b>Rather,</b> even though the details are not all written in the Torah, <b>once</b> the Samaritans <b>embraced</b> those disqualifications, <b>they embraced them,</b> and a Jew may rely on their slaughter; when they eat from the meat, it is permitted for a Jew to eat the meat as well. <b>Here too,</b> although the requirement of ritual slaughter for a bird is not written in the Torah, <b>once</b> the Samaritans <b>embraced</b> the mitzva of ritual slaughter, <b>they embraced</b> it in the same manner that it is performed by Jews.
<b>And with regard to</b> mitzvot <b>that are not written</b> explicitly in the Torah that Samaritans embraced, the question of whether they are <b>presumed</b> to fulfill them in the manner that Jews fulfill them <b>or</b> they are <b>not presumed</b> to do so <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is <b>permitted</b> to eat <b>the <i>matza</i> of a Samaritan</b> on Passover, <b>and a person fulfills his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>on</b> the first night of <b>Passover with it.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar prohibits</b> the consumption of the <i>matza</i> of a Samaritan on Passover, <b>because</b> the Samaritans <b>are not experts in the details of mitzvot like Jews</b> and do not know the precise nature of leaven prohibited by the Torah.
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> On the contrary, with regard to <b>any mitzva that the Samaritans embraced</b> and accepted upon themselves, <b>they are more exacting in its</b> observance <b>than</b> are <b>Jews.</b> Therefore, one may assume that they prepared the <i>matza</i> properly.
The Gemara proceeds to analyze that <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said:</b> It is <b>permitted</b> to eat <b>the <i>matza</i> of a Samaritan</b> on Passover, <b>and a person fulfills his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>on</b> the first night of <b>Passover with it.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that if the <i>matza</i> is permitted one fulfills his obligation with it on Passover? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that Samaritans <b>are not expert in</b> the mitzva of <b>guarding</b> the <i>matza</i> for the sake of the mitzva, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that they are expert. <b>Rabbi Elazar deems it prohibited</b> to eat the <i>matza</i> of Samaritans on Passover, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the Samaritans <b>are not experts in the details of mitzvot. He holds</b> that Samaritans <b>are not expert in</b> the mitzva of <b>guarding</b> the <i>matza</i> for the sake of the mitzva.
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> With regard to <b>any mitzva that Samaritans embraced</b> and accepted upon themselves, <b>they are</b> more <b>exacting in its</b> observance <b>than</b> are <b>Jews.</b> The Gemara raises an objection: <b>That is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between</b> their opinions with regard to a mitzva <b>that is written but</b> with regard to which the Samaritans <b>did not embrace it. The first <i>tanna</i> holds: Once</b> the mitzva <b>is written</b> in the Torah, <b>even if</b> there is <b>no</b> knowledge <b>that they embraced it,</b> Samaritans can be relied upon to perform it properly. <b>And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds:</b> Even with regard to a mitzva written in the Torah, <b>if they embraced</b> its observance, <b>yes,</b> one may rely on the Samaritans, but <b>if they did not embrace</b> its observance, <b>no,</b> one may not rely on them.
The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that this is the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, the formulation of his statement is imprecise. He said: With regard to <b>any mitzva that Samaritans embraced</b> and accepted upon themselves, they are more exacting in its observance than are Jews; this indicates that one may rely upon Samaritans to observe those mitzvot even if they are not written in the Torah. Therefore, <b>he should have</b> said: <b>If they embraced,</b> which addresses the statement of the first <i>tanna</i>. Contrary to the first <i>tanna</i>, who said that one may rely upon Samaritans with regard to any mitzva that is written, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that one may rely upon them only if they embraced the mitzva.
<b>Rather, there is</b> a practical difference <b>between</b> their opinions with regard to a mitzva <b>that is not written and</b> with regard to which the Samaritans <b>embraced its</b> observance. <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds: Since it is not written, even though they embraced its</b> observance one may <b>also not</b> rely upon them. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds: Once</b> it is known <b>that they embraced</b> observance of a mitzva, <b>they embraced</b> the mitzva and one may rely upon them.
§ With regard to the statement of Rava cited earlier (3a), the Gemara analyzes <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rava says:</b> In the case of <b>a Jewish transgressor</b> whose transgression is that he <b>eats</b> unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses to</b> satisfy his <b>appetite,</b> if he seeks to slaughter an animal, <b>one examines a knife</b> to ensure that it is perfectly smooth with no nicks <b>and gives</b> it <b>to</b> the transgressor, <b>and it is permitted to eat from</b> what <b>he slaughtered.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason? Since</b> in this case <b>there is</b> the option to slaughter the animal in <b>a permitted</b> manner <b>or</b> to slaughter the animal in <b>a prohibited</b> manner, such a transgressor <b>would not</b> intentionally <b>forsake the permitted</b> manner <b>and eat</b> food slaughtered in a <b>prohibited</b> manner. Since he has a knife that was examined and the majority of those associated with slaughter are experts, the food is presumed to be permitted, and there is no concern that perhaps he intentionally sabotaged the slaughter.
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even</b> in a case <b>where</b> the Jew <b>did not examine</b> the knife, it should be permitted to eat from the animal slaughtered by the transgressor. The Gemara answers: It is prohibited because if the transgressor discovers that the knife is flawed, <b>he does not exert</b> himself to replace it with a knife with a smooth blade.
<b>The Sages said to Rava:</b> A <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught that supports your</b> opinion: With regard to <b>the leavened bread of transgressors,</b> who do not eradicate their leavened bread before Passover, <b>after Passover</b>

Daf 4b

it is <b>permitted immediately, due to</b> the fact <b>that they exchange</b> the forbidden leavened bread in their possession with permitted leavened bread belonging to gentiles immediately after Passover.
The Sages who cited this proof <b>assumed</b> that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion? They assumed it <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says: Leavened bread</b> that was not eradicated before Passover is forbidden <b>after Passover by Torah law.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> nevertheless <b>it is taught</b> that it is permitted <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the transgressors <b>exchange</b> their leavened bread with that of gentiles. <b>Apparently,</b> even one who performs transgressions <b>does not</b> intentionally <b>forsake the permitted and eat forbidden</b> food, where the permitted food is easily accessible.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> in the <i>baraita</i> can this be proven? <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says: Leavened bread</b> that was not eradicated before Passover is prohibited <b>after Passover by rabbinic law. And</b> accordingly, <b>when we are lenient it is with regard to</b> prohibitions <b>by rabbinic law,</b> whereas <b>with regard to</b> prohibitions <b>by Torah law,</b> e.g., the prohibition of an unslaughtered carcass, <b>we are not lenient.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>And let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>be even</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. Does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach: As I say</b> that <b>they exchanged</b> their leavened bread for the leavened bread of a gentile, which would indicate that it is an assumption? <b>He teaches: Due to</b> the fact <b>that they exchange,</b> as a statement of fact, <b>as they certainly exchange. And if in</b> cases involving prohibitions <b>by rabbinic law</b> the transgressor <b>does not</b> intentionally <b>forsake the permitted and eat forbidden</b> food, then <b>in</b> prohibitions <b>by Torah law</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> reasonable that he would not forsake the permitted in favor of the forbidden?
<b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of Rava: <b>Everyone slaughters, and even a Samaritan, and even an uncircumcised</b> man, <b>and even a Jewish transgressor.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>This uncircumcised</b> man, <b>what are the circumstances? If we say</b> that he is an uncircumcised man <b>whose brothers died due to circumcision</b> and the concern is that he might suffer a similar fate, clearly he may slaughter, as <b>he is a full-fledged Jew</b> and not a transgressor at all. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that he is <b>a transgressor with regard to</b> remaining <b>uncircumcised,</b> as he refuses to be circumcised, <b>and</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that he may nevertheless slaughter an animal since <b>a transgressor concerning one matter is not a transgressor concerning the entire Torah.</b>
<b>Say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And even a Jewish transgressor. This transgressor, what are the circumstances? If he is a transgressor concerning another matter</b> besides eating unslaughtered animal carcasses, <b>that is</b> identical to the case of <b>a transgressor with regard to</b> remaining <b>uncircumcised. Rather, is it not</b> that he is <b>a transgressor concerning the same matter</b> of eating unslaughtered carcasses, <b>and</b> the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava,</b> who said that one may even rely on the slaughter of a Jewish transgressor whose transgression is that he eats unslaughtered animal carcasses to satisfy his appetite, <i>ab initio</i>?
The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>No, actually I will say to you:</b> The slaughter of <b>a transgressor concerning the same matter</b> is <b>not</b> valid. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is that <b>since he has become accustomed to</b> performance of that transgression, it is <b>like a permitted</b> act <b>for him,</b> and the concern is that he is not at all careful to slaughter the animal properly. <b>Rather,</b> the transgressor mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>a transgressor with regard to idol worship, and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Anan, as Rav Anan says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a Jew</b> who is <b>a transgressor with regard to idol worship, it is permitted to eat from</b> what <b>he slaughters.</b>
§ The Gemara analyzes <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Anan says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a Jew</b> who is <b>a transgressor with regard to idol worship, it is permitted to eat from</b> what <b>he slaughters, as we found with regard to Jehoshaphat, king of Judea, who partook of the feast</b> prepared by <b>Ahab,</b> king of Israel, who was a transgressor with regard to idol worship, <b>as it is stated: “And Ahab slaughtered sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, and incited him to go up with him to Ramoth Gilead”</b> (II Chronicles 18:2).
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>And perhaps</b> Ahab <b>slaughtered</b> the animals, but Jehoshaphat <b>did not eat</b> the meat of those animals. The Gemara explains: <b>It is written: “And incited him,”</b> indicating that there was an element of persuasion that presumably involved food. The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>And perhaps</b> Ahab incited him <b>with</b> his <b>words.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There is no incitement with words.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there <b>not</b> incitement with words? <b>But isn’t it written: “If your brother…entices you</b> secretly, saying: Let us go and serve other gods” (Deuteronomy 13:7)? The Gemara answers: There too the incitement is <b>with eating and with drinking.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> that God said to Satan, who denounced Job: <b>“And you incited Me against him, to destroy him gratuitously”</b> (Job 2:3)? Clearly Satan did not incite God with food and drink. The Gemara answers: Incitement against the One <b>on High is different,</b> as the term is used metaphorically. By contrast, incitement with regard to people involves food and drink.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And perhaps</b> Jehoshaphat <b>drank</b> at the feast but <b>did not eat.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>What is different</b> about <b>drinking</b> wine with Ahab that it would be permitted? It would be permitted because <b>we say: A transgressor with regard to idol worship is not</b> considered <b>a transgressor with regard to the entire Torah</b> and therefore his wine is not forbidden. With regard to <b>eating</b> a transgressor’s food <b>too, a transgressor with regard to idol worship is not</b> considered <b>a transgressor with regard to the entire Torah.</b> Therefore, the meat of an animal that he slaughters is not forbidden.
The Gemara asks: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared?</b> With regard to <b>drinking,</b> Ahab’s wine <b>is</b> considered <b>ordinary wine</b> of gentiles, <b>and the ordinary wine of gentiles was not yet prohibited,</b> as the Sages issued that decree only several generations later. Therefore, it was permitted for Jehoshaphat to drink Ahab’s wine. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>eating, I will say to you: A transgressor with regard to idol worship is</b> considered <b>a transgressor with regard to the entire Torah.</b> Therefore, it was prohibited for Jehoshaphat to eat the meat from the animals slaughtered by Ahab.
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say:</b> It is clear that Jehoshaphat ate at the feast, as it is <b>not typical conduct of a king to drink</b> wine <b>without eating. And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>“And</b> Ahab <b>slaughtered</b> sheep and cattle for him in abundance, and for the people that were with him, <b>and incited him,” is written,</b> indicating: <b>With what did</b> Ahab <b>incite</b> Jehoshaphat? It was <b>with slaughter</b> of an animal. Apparently, it is permitted to eat from an animal slaughtered by a transgressor with regard to idol worship.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And perhaps Obadiah,</b> who was the majordomo of Ahab’s household and a righteous man, <b>slaughtered</b> the animals. The Gemara rejects that suggestion: <b>“In abundance” is written,</b> and <b>Obadiah would not have managed</b> to slaughter all the animals himself.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And perhaps</b> the <b>seven thousand</b> righteous people <b>slaughtered</b> the animals, <b>as it is written: “And I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal,</b> and every mouth that has not kissed it” (I Kings 19:18). The Gemara rejects that suggestion: <b>They were hiding from Jezebel,</b> Ahab’s wife, and would not have gone to the palace to slaughter animals for the feast.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And perhaps,</b> although Ahab was an idolater, <b>the men</b> in the employ <b>of Ahab were upstanding</b> people, not idolaters, and they slaughtered the animals. The Gemara rejects that suggestion: That possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as it is written: “If a ruler hearkens to matters of falsehood, all his servants are wicked”</b> (Proverbs 29:12).
The Gemara suggests: <b>And perhaps the men</b> in the employ <b>of Jehoshaphat were also not upstanding,</b> and the animals that <b>the men</b> in the employ <b>of Ahab slaughtered, the men</b> in the employ <b>of Jehoshaphat ate,</b> and the animals that <b>Obadiah slaughtered, Jehoshaphat ate.</b>
The Gemara rejects that suggestion: That possibility should <b>not enter your mind; from</b> the fact <b>that</b> it is written: <b>“If a ruler hearkens to matters of falsehood, all his servants are wicked,”</b> it may be inferred that if a ruler hearkens <b>to matters of truth, all his servants are righteous.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>And perhaps</b> the animals that <b>the men</b> in the employ <b>of Ahab slaughtered, Ahab and his men ate,</b> and the animals that <b>the men</b> in the employ <b>of Jehoshaphat slaughtered, Jehoshaphat and his men ate.</b>

Daf 5a

The Gemara rejects that suggestion: Jehoshaphat <b>would not have separated himself from</b> Ahab to eat and drink by himself, as he relied on him completely. <b>From where do we</b> derive this? <b>If we say</b> that it is derived <b>from</b> that <b>which is written</b> that Jehoshaphat said to Ahab: <b>“I am as you are, my people as your people”</b> (I Kings 22:4), i.e., I am equally reliable, this is difficult, as, <b>if that is so,</b> then when Jehoshaphat said at the conclusion of that verse: <b>“My horses as your horses,”</b> can this <b>also</b> be referring to reliability? <b>Rather,</b> Jehoshaphat’s intention was: <b>That which will befall your horses will befall my horses; so too, that which will befall you and your people will befall me and my people.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it is derived that Jehoshaphat relied upon Ahab <b>from here: “And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, king of Judea, sat each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in a threshing floor, at the entrance of the gate of Samaria”</b> (I Kings 22:10). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b>threshing floor</b> in this context? <b>If we say</b> that it was <b>an actual threshing floor; is that to say</b> that <b>the gate of Samaria was a threshing floor?</b> Typically, the gate of a city was the place of assembly for the city’s judges and elders, not a threshing floor. <b>Rather,</b> they were sitting in a configuration <b>like</b> that of a circular <b>threshing floor,</b> i.e., facing each other in a display of amity, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 36b): <b>A Sanhedrin was</b> arranged in the same layout <b>as half of a circular threshing floor, so that</b> the judges <b>would see each other.</b> This verse demonstrates that Jehoshaphat deliberated with Ahab and relied on his judgment.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the verse written with regard to Elijah <b>supports</b> the opinion of Rav Anan. The verse states: <b>“And the ravens [<i>orevim</i>] brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening”</b> (I Kings 17:6); <b>and Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> They would bring the meat <b>from the slaughterhouse of Ahab.</b> Clearly, Elijah would not have eaten the meat if Ahab’s slaughter was not valid. The Gemara responds: Since he ate the meat <b>according to the word</b> of God, the case of Elijah <b>is different,</b> and no proof may be cited from there.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>orevim</i></b> in this context? <b>Ravina said:</b> They were <b>actual ravens. Rav Adda bar Minyumi said to him: And perhaps</b> they were <b>two men whose names were Oreb? Isn’t it written: “And they slew Oreb at the Rock of Oreb, and Zeeb</b> they slew at the winepress of Zeeb” (Judges 7:25), indicating that Oreb is a person’s name? Ravina <b>said to him:</b> Did <b>the matter</b> just so <b>happen that the names of both of</b> the people supplying Elijah with food <b>were Oreb?</b> The improbability of this occurrence indicates that they were actual ravens.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And perhaps</b> they are called <i>orevim</i> <b>after the name of their place</b> of origin. <b>Isn’t it written: “And the Arameans had gone out in bands, and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a minor young woman [<i>na’ara ketana</i>]”</b> (II Kings 5:2)? <b>And</b> it is <b>difficult for us</b> to understand why the verse <b>calls her a young woman and</b> also <b>calls her a minor,</b> which are two different stages in a girl’s development. <b>And Rabbi Pedat said:</b> She was <b>a minor girl who was from</b> a place called <b>Naaran.</b> Perhaps in the case of Elijah they were two people from a place called Oreb. The Gemara rejects that suggestion: <b>If so, Orebites [<i>oreviyyim</i>] should have</b> been written in the verse.
§ <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of Rav Anan, who says that it is permitted to eat from the slaughter of a Jew who is a transgressor with regard to idol worship: <b>Everyone slaughters, and even a Samaritan, and even an uncircumcised</b> man, <b>and even a Jewish transgressor.</b> The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This uncircumcised</b> man, <b>what are the circumstances? If we say</b> that he is an uncircumcised man <b>whose brothers died due to circumcision</b> and the concern is that he might suffer a similar fate, clearly one may eat from what he slaughters, as <b>he is a full-fledged Jew</b> and not a transgressor at all. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that he is <b>a transgressor with regard to</b> remaining <b>uncircumcised,</b> as he refuses to be circumcised.
<b>Say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And even a Jewish transgressor. What are the circumstances? If he is a transgressor with regard to one matter, that is</b> identical to the case of <b>a transgressor with regard to</b> remaining <b>uncircumcised. Rather, is it not</b> that he is <b>a transgressor with regard to idol worship, and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Anan?</b>
The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>No, actually I will say to you</b> that <b>a transgressor with regard to idol worship</b> may <b>not</b> slaughter, <b>as the Master said: Idol worship is a severe</b> transgression, <b>as</b> with regard to <b>anyone who denies it,</b> it is <b>as</b> though <b>he acknowledges</b> his acceptance of <b>the entire Torah.</b> Conversely, with regard to one who accepts idolatry, it is as though he denies the entire Torah. Therefore, his halakhic status is that of a transgressor with regard to the entire Torah, and his slaughter is not valid.
<b>Rather,</b> the transgressor in the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>a transgressor concerning the same matter</b> of eating unslaughtered carcasses, <b>and</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava,</b> who said that one may rely on the slaughter of a transgressor with regard to eating unslaughtered animal carcasses to satisfy his appetite even <i>ab initio</i>.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Anan from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “When any man of you brings an offering unto the Lord, from the animal” (Leviticus 1:2). The <i>tanna</i> infers: <b>“Of you,”</b> indicating: <b>But not all of you.</b> This serves <b>to exclude the transgressor,</b> from whom an offering is not accepted. The <i>tanna</i> continues: The term <b>“of you”</b> is also interpreted to mean that <b>I distinguished among you and not among the nations.</b> Therefore, a gentile may bring an offering even if he is an idol worshipper. The expression <b>“from the animal”</b> serves <b>to include people who are similar to an animal</b> in that they do not recognize God. <b>From here,</b> the Sages <b>stated: One accepts offerings from Jewish transgressors so that they will consequently repent, except for the transgressor, one who pours wine as a libation</b> to idolatry, <b>and one who desecrates Shabbat in public [<i>befarhesya</i>].</b>
<b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult.</b> Initially, <b>you said: “Of you,”</b> indicating: <b>But not all of you.</b> This serves <b>to exclude the transgressor,</b> from whom an offering is not accepted. <b>And then</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: One accepts offerings from Jewish transgressors.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult. The first clause</b> states that an offering is not accepted from <b>a transgressor with regard to the entire Torah. The middle clause</b> states that one accepts an offering from <b>a transgressor with regard to one matter.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>Say the last clause: Except for the transgressor, and one who pours wine as a libation</b> to idolatry, <b>and one who desecrates Shabbat in public.</b> With regard to <b>this transgressor</b> in the last clause, <b>what are the circumstances? If</b> the reference is to <b>a transgressor with regard to the entire Torah, that is</b> identical to <b>the first clause:</b> Of you, and not all of you, to exclude the transgressor. <b>And if</b> the reference is to <b>a transgressor with regard to one matter, the middle clause</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as it is stated there that one accepts an offering from a transgressor with regard to one matter.
<b>Rather, is it not</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying</b> in the last clause: <b>Except for the transgressor to pour wine as a libation</b> to idolatry <b>or to desecrate Shabbat in public? Apparently, a transgressor with regard to idol worship is a transgressor with regard to the entire Torah, and</b> this <i>baraita</i> is <b>a refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Anan.</b> The Gemara concludes: It is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And is this</b> <i>halakha</i> that one does not accept an offering from a transgressor <b>derived from</b> the verse cited <b>here? It is derived from</b> the verse written <b>there</b> with regard to a sin offering:

Daf 5b

“And if any one <b>of the common people</b> sins unwittingly…and he shall bring his offering” (Leviticus 4:27–28), from which it is inferred in a <i>baraita</i>: “Of the common people,” indicating: But not all of the common people. This serves <b>to exclude a transgressor,</b> from whom a sin offering is not accepted.
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yosei says in the name of Rabbi Shimon</b> that the verse states: “And does <b>unwittingly</b> one of the things…<b>that may not be done, and he becomes guilty,</b> or if his sin that he sinned became known to him” (Leviticus 4:22–23). From the words “become known to him” it is inferred: <b>One who repents due to his awareness</b> that he performed a transgression, as had he known that the action is prohibited he would not have performed it, <b>brings an offering for his unwitting</b> transgression in order to achieve atonement. But one who <b>does not repent due to his awareness</b> that he sinned, e.g., a transgressor who would have sinned even had he been aware that the act is prohibited, <b>does not bring an offering for his unwitting</b> action.
<b>And we say: What</b> is the difference <b>between their</b> two opinions? <b>And Rav Hamnuna said:</b> The difference is in the case of <b>a transgressor with regard to eating</b> the forbidden <b>fat</b> of a domesticated animal <b>and he brought an offering for</b> unwittingly consuming <b>blood is</b> the difference <b>between them.</b> According to the first <i>tanna</i> he may not bring an offering, as he is a transgressor. According to Rabbi Shimon, since he repented for unwittingly consuming blood, due to his awareness that he sinned, he brings a sin offering for that unwitting sin. In any event, this <i>baraita</i> apparently contradicts the previously cited <i>baraita</i> with regard to the source for the <i>halakha</i> that one does not accept an offering from a transgressor.
The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> source teaches <b>with regard to</b> the <b>sin offering</b> of a transgressor that it is not accepted, <b>and one</b> source teaches <b>with regard to</b> the <b>burnt offering</b> of a transgressor that it is not accepted. <b>And</b> both sources <b>are necessary, as, if</b> the Torah had <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> only with regard to <b>a sin offering,</b> one might have thought that it is not accepted <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is for atonement,</b> and as a transgressor he is undeserving of atonement, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>a burnt offering, which is</b> merely <b>a gift [<i>dedoron</i>], say</b> that one ought <b>to accept</b> it <b>from him. And if</b> the Torah had <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> only with regard to <b>a burnt offering,</b> one might have thought that it is not accepted <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is not an obligation, but</b> with regard to <b>a sin offering, which is an obligation, say</b> that one ought <b>to accept</b> it <b>from him.</b> Therefore, both sources are <b>necessary.</b>
§ In the previous <i>baraita</i> the Sages derived from the phrase “from the animal” that people who are similar to an animal are included among those from whom offerings are accepted. The Gemara seeks to understand the meaning of the phrase: Similar to an animal, and asks: <b>And everywhere that</b> the word <b>animal is written</b> and interpreted as referring to a person, does it indicate <b>a deficiency? But isn’t it written: “Man and animal You preserve, Lord”</b> (Psalms 36:7), <b>and Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: These are people who are clever in</b> terms of their <b>intellect,</b> like people, <b>and</b> despite their intelligence they <b>comport themselves</b> humbly and self-effacingly, <b>like an animal.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There it is written “man and animal.” Here,</b> the word <b>“animal” alone is written.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And everywhere that</b> the terms <b>“man” and “animal” are written</b> together, does it indicate <b>a virtue? But isn’t it written: “And I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man and with the seed of animal”</b> (Jeremiah 31:26), and the Sages interpreted the phrase “seed of animal” as a reference to ignorant, inferior people. The Gemara answers: <b>There, doesn’t the verse separate</b> man and animal? <b>The seed of man</b> is <b>discrete and the seed of animal</b> is <b>discrete.</b>
§ The Gemara revisits the matter of slaughter by a Samaritan and cites <b>a mnemonic</b> for the names of the Sages that follow: <b><i>Nun</i>,</b> for Ḥanan; <b><i>kuf</i>,</b> for Ya’akov; <b><i>lamed</i>,</b> for ben Levi; and <b><i>peh</i>,</b> for bar Kappara.
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥanan says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says in the name of bar Kappara:</b> The opinions of <b>Rabban Gamliel and his court were counted with regard to</b> the status of <b>the slaughter of a Samaritan, and they prohibited it. Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi: Perhaps my teacher heard</b> that <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where a Jew is not standing over him.</b> Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: <b>This</b> one <b>of the Sages seems like</b> one of <b>the people who have not studied <i>halakha</i>. When a Jew is not standing over</b> the Samaritan <b>is it necessary to say</b> that it is prohibited to eat from what he slaughters?
The Gemara asks: <b>Did</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>accept</b> that response <b>from</b> Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi <b>or did he not accept it from him? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof to resolve that dilemma from that <b>which Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi says: I saw that Rabbi Yoḥanan ate from the slaughter of a Samaritan.</b> And <b>Rabbi Asi too ate from the slaughter of a Samaritan. And Rabbi Zeira wondered about it,</b> whether perhaps <b>they did not hear</b> the <i>halakha</i> that it is prohibited to eat from the slaughter of a Samaritan <b>but had they heard</b> it <b>they would have accepted it, or perhaps they heard</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>but did not accept it.</b>
Rabbi Zeira <b>then resolved</b> the matter <b>for himself. It stands to reason that they heard it and did not accept it. As, if it enters your mind</b> that <b>they did not hear it, but</b> that <b>had they heard it they would have accepted it, how did the matter eventuate,</b> leading these Sages <b>to eat forbidden</b> food? <b>Now</b> consider: If even <b>through the animals of the righteous, the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not generate mishaps,</b> then is it <b>not all the more so</b> true that <b>the righteous themselves</b> would not experience mishaps?

Daf 6a

<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that Rabbi Zeira <b>did not accept</b> from Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi that Rabban Gamliel prohibited eating from the slaughter of a Samaritan even when a Jew was standing over him, <b>let</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>resolve</b> the matter <b>for himself</b> in a different manner: <b>Here,</b> where Rabbi Yoḥanan ate from the slaughter of a Samaritan, it was <b>when a Jew</b> was <b>standing over him; there,</b> where Rabban Gamliel prohibited eating from the slaughter of a Samaritan, it was <b>when a Jew was not standing over him. Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Zeira <b>accepted</b> the response <b>from</b> Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi. The Gemara affirms: Indeed, <b>learn</b> this <b>from it.</b>
§ The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>the Sages,</b> Rabban Gamliel and his court, <b>issued a decree</b> rendering it prohibited to eat from the slaughter of Samaritans? The Gemara answers: It is <b>like that</b> case <b>involving Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> in which <b>Rabbi Meir dispatched him to bring wine from the area of the Samaritans. A certain elder found him</b> and <b>said to him: “And put a knife to your throat, if you are a man given to appetite”</b> (Proverbs 23:2),as a warning to distance himself from them and not to drink their wine, because they were not reliable. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar went and related</b> those <b>matters before Rabbi Meir, and</b> Rabbi Meir <b>issued a decree against them.</b>
<b>What is the reason</b> that the Samaritans are deemed unreliable? <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: At the peak of Mount Gerizim they found the image of a dove, which</b> the Samaritan residents of Mount Gerizim <b>would worship; and Rabbi Meir</b> issued the decree <b>according to his</b> line of <b>reasoning that he takes the minority into consideration, and</b> therefore, despite the fact that the majority of Samaritans did not live on Mount Gerizim, <b>he issued a decree</b> rendering meat slaughtered by <b>the majority</b> forbidden <b>due to the minority</b> that worshipped that idol. <b>And Rabban Gamliel and his court also hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>
The Gemara asks: As to <b>the plain</b> meaning <b>of</b> that <b>verse:</b> “And put a knife to your throat, if you are a man given to appetite,” <b>with regard to what</b> matter is <b>it written?</b> The Gemara answers: It is written <b>with regard to a student who is sitting before his teacher,</b> as he must consider his words carefully. <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> interpreting the verses: <b>“When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider well [<i>bin tavin</i>] him that is before you; and put a knife to your throat, if you are a man given to appetite”</b> (Proverbs 23:1–2).
The <i>tanna</i> explains the verse: <b>If a student knows about his teacher that he knows to respond to him</b> with <b>a reasoned</b> answer, <b>seek wisdom [<i>bin</i>]</b> from him. <b>And if</b> the student believes that the teacher is <b>not</b> capable of doing so, <b>understand [<i>tavin</i>] who is sitting before you, and put a knife to your throat</b> and refrain from embarrassing him with questions that he cannot answer. And <b>if you are a man given to appetite</b> and you seek an answer to your question, <b>distance yourself from him.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abbahu dispatched Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Yosef to bring wine from the area of the Samaritans. A certain elder found him</b> and <b>said to him:</b> The people <b>here</b> are <b>not keepers of the Torah. Rabbi Yitzḥak went and related the matters before Rabbi Abbahu, and Rabbi Abbahu went and related the matters before Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi, and they did not move from there until they rendered</b> the Samaritans <b>full-fledged gentiles.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> matters did those Sages render them full-fledged gentiles? <b>If it was to</b> prohibit eating from their <b>slaughter and</b> to render their wine as <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> in idol worship, these prohibitions were issued previously. <b>From there,</b> from the generations of Rabbi Meir and Rabban Gamliel, <b>the Sages issued a decree</b> prohibiting <b>them.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They issued a decree, and</b> the people <b>did not accept</b> it <b>from them. Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi came</b> and <b>issued a decree, and</b> the people <b>accepted</b> it <b>from them.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>full-fledged gentiles? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It means that the halakhic status of a Samaritan is like that of a gentile with regard <b>to renouncing</b> his <b>domain</b> in a jointly-owned courtyard on Shabbat <b>and to transferring</b> his <b>domain</b> in the courtyard to residents of that courtyard.
<b>And</b> this is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a Jewish transgressor</b> who nevertheless <b>observes his Shabbat in the marketplace,</b> i.e., in public, if he failed to establish a joining of houses in a courtyard before Shabbat, his halakhic status is that of an observant Jew, and he may <b>renounce</b> his <b>domain</b> in the courtyard <b>and transfer</b> his <b>domain</b> in the courtyard. <b>But</b> a transgressor <b>who does not observe his Shabbat in the marketplace</b> may <b>neither renounce</b> his <b>domain</b> in the courtyard <b>nor transfer</b> his <b>domain</b> in the courtyard.
This is <b>because</b> the Sages <b>said:</b> Only <b>a Jew</b> may verbally <b>transfer</b> rights in his <b>domain or renounce</b> his rights in his <b>domain,</b> but <b>with regard to a gentile,</b> the other residents cannot establish a joining of courtyards <b>unless</b> the residents of the courtyard <b>lease</b> his domain from him. The halakhic status of one who publicly desecrates Shabbat is that of a gentile.
<b>How</b> does a Jew transfer or renounce his domain? If a Jew <b>says to</b> his neighbor: <b>My domain is transferred to you</b> or <b>my domain is renounced to you,</b> his neighbor <b>has acquired</b> his domain, <b>and it is not necessary</b> for him <b>to grant</b> it to his neighbor by means of one of the standard modes of acquisition.
§ The Gemara revisits the statement that the righteous would not experience mishaps. <b>Rabbi Zeira and Rav Asi happened</b> to come <b>to the inn of</b> the town of <b>Ya’ei.</b> In the inn, <b>they brought before</b> these Sages <b>eggs that shriveled</b> after being cooked <b>in wine. Rabbi Zeira did not eat</b> the eggs, <b>and Rav Asi ate</b> them. <b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rav Asi: And is the Master not concerned about</b> the possibility that the dish is <b>a mixture</b> containing wine that is <b>doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>]?</b> Rav Asi <b>said to him:</b> It did <b>not</b> enter <b>my mind.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> to himself: Is it <b>possible</b> that the Sages <b>issued a decree on a mixture</b> containing <b><i>demai</i> and the matter eventuated that Rav Asi ate forbidden</b> food? <b>Now,</b> since <b>even</b> with regard to <b>the animals of the righteous, the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not generate mishaps through them,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> true that <b>the righteous themselves</b> would not experience mishaps?
<b>Rabbi Zeira emerged, analyzed, and found</b> that no mishap was generated through Rav Asi, <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Demai</i> 1:24): In the case of <b>one who purchases wine to place into fish gravy [<i>hamorayes</i>] or into <i>aluntit</i>,</b> a beverage in which wine is mixed, or one who purchases <b>vetch to prepare grist from it,</b> or <b>lentils to prepare groats from it,</b> if it is uncertain whether what he purchased is tithed, e.g., he bought it from one who is unreliable with regard to tithes [<i>am ha’aretz</i>], <b>one is obligated</b> to tithe it, <b>due to</b> the fact that it is <b><i>demai</i>. And needless to say,</b> if it is certain that what he purchased is not tithed, he is obligated to tithe it <b>due to</b> the fact that it is <b>certain</b> that it is untithed produce.
<b>And they themselves,</b> the gravy, <i>aluntit</i>, grist, and groats that one purchased from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, <b>are permitted, because they are a mixture.</b> Since only one element of the mixture must be tithed, the food is permitted.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that the Sages <b>did not issue a decree on a mixture</b> containing <b><i>demai</i>? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who gives his neighbor,</b> who is an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, <b>dough to bake</b> and gives her leaven for the dough to rise, <b>or</b> gives her <b>a pot</b> of food and the spices <b>to cook</b> in it, he need <b>not be concerned about the leaven and the spices that are in</b> the dough and the pot respectively, that perhaps she replaced them with her own, <b>neither with regard to</b> the possibility that they are <b>Sabbatical</b> Year produce <b>nor with regard to</b> the possibility that <b>tithe</b> was not separated.
<b>And if he says to her: Prepare</b> the dough or the food <b>for me with your own</b> leaven and spices, <b>he</b> must be <b>concerned about the leaven and the spices that are in</b> the dough and the pot respectively, <b>with regard to</b> the possibility that they are <b>Sabbatical</b> Year produce <b>and with regard to</b> the possibility that <b>tithe</b> was not separated, even though it is a mixture containing <i>demai</i>.
The Gemara answers: It is <b>different there, as, since he said to her: Prepare</b> the dough or the food <b>for me from your own,</b> it is <b>like one who mixed it by</b> direct <b>action. Rafram said: Leaven and spices are different, as</b> each of them <b>is made for</b> the purpose of adding <b>taste</b> to the mixture, <b>and taste is not nullified</b> in a mixture.
The Gemara asks: <b>And are we not concerned about replacement</b> of the ingredients that he gave his neighbor with her own? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 3:6): <b>One who gives</b> dough <b>to his mother-in-law,</b> who is suspect with regard to tithing, so that she will prepare it for him, must <b>tithe</b> everything <b>that he gives her and</b> everything <b>that he takes</b> back <b>from her.</b> This is <b>because she is suspected</b> of <b>replacing</b> an ingredient <b>that spoils.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There, the reason</b> is <b>like it is taught</b> explicitly in that mishna, that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> The mother-in-law <b>desires her daughter’s well-being</b> and wants to ensure that she eats quality food, <b>and is reticent</b> to tell <b>her son-in-law</b> that she replaced the ingredients that spoiled.

Daf 6b

The Gemara asks: <b>And in general,</b> in a case not involving one’s mother-in-law, <b>are we not concerned</b> about the possibility of replacement? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 3:5): <b>One who gives</b> dough or a pot of food <b>to his innkeeper [<i>pundakit</i>]</b> who is an <i>am ha’aretz</i> to bake or cook, <b>tithes what he gives her and</b> tithes <b>what he takes</b> back <b>from her, due to</b> the fact <b>that she is suspected</b> of <b>replacing</b> the ingredients? The Gemara answers: <b>There too,</b> her intentions are good, as the innkeeper <b>rationalizes</b> her deception <b>and says:</b> Let the <b>student</b> of Torah <b>eat</b> my <b>hot</b> food <b>and I will eat</b> his <b>cold</b> food.
The Gemara asks: <b>And are we not concerned about replacement</b> of the ingredients? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The wife of a <i>ḥaver</i>,</b> one devoted to the meticulous observance of mitzvot, especially the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity, <i>teruma</i>, and tithes,<b>grinds</b> grain <b>with the wife of an <i>am ha’aretz</i> when</b> the wife of the <i>ḥaver</i> <b>is ritually impure</b> with the impurity of a menstruating woman. In that case, there is no concern that she will eat her counterpart’s untithed produce, as, since she is impure she will refrain from touching the grain so that she will not render it impure. <b>But</b> she may <b>not</b> do so <b>when she is ritually pure,</b> due to the concern that she will eat the untithed produce.
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Even when she is impure,</b> the wife of the <i>ḥaver</i> <b>may not grind</b> grain together with the wife of the <i>am ha’aretz</i>, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that her counterpart gives her</b> grain <b>and she eats</b> it without touching the rest of the grain.
The Gemara infers: <b>Now</b> that there is suspicion that the wife of the <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>steals</b> from her husband’s grain and gives it to her counterparts, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that she is suspect with regard to <b>replacing</b> ingredients? <b>Rav Yosef said: There too</b> there are special circumstances, as the wife of the <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>rationalizes</b> her behavior <b>and says</b> metaphorically: <b>The ox eats from its threshing,</b> and believes that the wife of the <i>ḥaver</i> is entitled to some of the grain that she is grinding.
§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the statement that the righteous would not experience mishaps. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Zeruz, son of the father-in-law of Rabbi Meir, testified before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>about Rabbi Meir that he ate the leaf of a vegetable in Beit She’an</b> without tithing or separating <i>teruma</i>, as he holds that Beit She’an is not part of Eretz Yisrael and therefore is not sacred with its sanctity. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permitted all</b> the produce of <b>Beit She’an on</b> the basis of <b>his</b> testimony.
<b>His brothers and his father’s household united against him</b> and <b>said to him:</b> In <b>a place where your fathers and the fathers of your fathers treated</b> untithed produce as <b>forbidden, will you treat</b> it as <b>permitted?</b>
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>interpreted this verse to them: “And he broke in pieces the copper serpent that Moses had made; for until those days the children of Israel burned incense to it; and it was called Nehushtan”</b> (II Kings 18:4). Is it <b>possible</b> that they burned incense to it and <b>Asa,</b> a righteous king, <b>came and did not eradicate it,</b> and <b>Jehoshaphat,</b> a righteous king, <b>came and did not eradicate it,</b> and it remained until the time of Hezekiah? <b>But didn’t Asa and Jehoshaphat eradicate all</b> objects of <b>idol worship in the world?</b>

Daf 7a

<b>Rather,</b> it must be that in not eradicating the serpent, <b>his ancestors left</b> Hezekiah <b>room through which to achieve prominence [<i>lehitgader</i>]. I too</b> can say that <b>my ancestors left me room through which to achieve prominence</b> by permitting untithed produce from Beit She’an.
The Gemara adds: <b>From here</b> one learns with regard to <b>a Torah scholar who states</b> a new <b>matter of <i>halakha</i> that one does not move [<i>meziḥin</i>] him</b> from his position; <b>and some say: One does not disregard [<i>mazniḥin</i>] him; and some say: One does not attribute</b> his innovative statement <b>to his conceit [<i>mazḥiḥin</i>].</b>
The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>the one who says <i>meziḥin</i>,</b> it is <b>as that which is written: “And the breastplate shall not be loosed [<i>yizaḥ</i>] from the ephod”</b> (Exodus 28:28). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the one who says: One does not disregard [<i>mazniḥin</i>],</b> it is <b>as it is written: “For the Lord will not abandon [<i>yizaḥ</i>] forever”</b> (Lamentations 3:31). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the one who says <i>mazḥiḥin</i>,</b> it is <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sota</i> 14:9): <b>From</b> the time <b>that those with conceited [<i>zeḥuḥei</i>] hearts proliferated, dispute proliferated among the Jewish people.</b>
<b>Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, objects to</b> the basic <i>halakha</i>: <b>And is there anyone who says that Beit She’an is not</b> part <b>of Eretz Yisrael? But isn’t it written: “And Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth She’an and its towns, nor of Taanach and its towns”</b> (Judges 1:27).
The Gemara answers: <b>That which Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim says in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat, who says in the name of Rabbi Elazar ben Shammua, escaped</b> the attention of Yehuda: <b>Many cities were conquered by those who ascended from Egypt</b> to Eretz Yisrael, led by Joshua, son of Nun, <b>and were not conquered by those who ascended from Babylonia</b> to Eretz Yisrael in the return to Zion led by Ezra. Among those cities was Beit She’an.
<b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds: The initial consecration</b> with which Eretz Yisrael was sanctified during the era of Joshua, son of Nun, in terms of the obligation to fulfill land-based mitzvot, <b>sanctified</b> Eretz Yisrael <b>for its time but did not sanctify</b> it <b>forever.</b> Rather, the obligation lapsed with the exile to Babylonia. When those who ascended from Babylonia returned to Eretz Yisrael <b>and</b> sanctified the land, <b>they left</b> certain places unsanctified, <b>so that the poor would rely upon them</b> for sustenance <b>during the Sabbatical</b> Year, when produce is not plentiful. Since these areas were not sanctified, it is permitted to sow crops there during the Sabbatical Year, and the poor will not go hungry. Once Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi discovered that Beit She’an was one of those cities, he exempted it from land-based mitzvot.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira:</b> How did Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi rely on the testimony of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Zeruz to exempt from <i>terumot</i> and tithes produce that grows in Beit She’an? <b>But wasn’t it merely a leaf that Rabbi Meir ate?</b> It is permitted to eat untithed produce incidentally, not in the framework of a meal. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: He ate</b> the leaf <b>from a bundle, and we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 1:5): With regard to <b>a vegetable that is</b> typically <b>bound</b> in a bundle, one is obligated to separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes <b>from</b> the moment <b>that it is bound.</b> From that point, one may not eat from it even incidentally before tithing.
Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira: <b>And perhaps</b> it was <b>not on</b> Rabbi Meir’s <b>mind,</b> and his attention was diverted when he ate the leaf. Rabbi Zeira answered: <b>Now,</b> since even with regard to <b>the animals of the righteous, the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not generate mishaps through them,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> true that <b>the righteous themselves</b> would not experience mishaps?
Rabbi Yirmeya asked: <b>And perhaps</b> Rabbi Meir <b>tithed those</b> leaves <b>from</b> produce in <b>another place.</b> Rabbi Zeira answered: <b><i>Ḥaverim</i> are not suspected of separating <i>teruma</i> from</b> produce <b>that is not proximate</b> to the produce for which it is being separated. Rabbi Yirmeya asked: <b>And perhaps</b> Rabbi Meir <b>set his sight on this side</b> of the vegetable with the intent of separating <i>teruma</i> and tithes, <b>and ate</b> a leaf <b>on the other side.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: See who the great man</b> is <b>who is testifying about</b> Rabbi Meir. Certainly a man of the stature of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Zeruz accurately observed and reported Rabbi Meir’s actions.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the reference to <b>animals of the righteous,</b> about whom it is stated that God does not generate mishaps through them? It is based on the incident <b>where Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir was going to</b> engage in <b>the redemption of captives,</b> and <b>he encountered the Ginai River.</b>
<b>He said to</b> the river: <b>Ginai, part your water for me and I will pass through you.</b> The river <b>said to him: You are going to perform the will of your Maker and I am going to perform the will of my Maker,</b> to flow in my path. With regard to <b>you,</b> it is <b>uncertain</b> whether you will <b>perform</b> His will successfully, <b>and</b> it is <b>uncertain</b> whether <b>you</b> will <b>not perform</b> His will successfully. <b>I</b> will <b>certainly perform</b> His will successfully. Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to</b> the river: <b>If you do not part, I</b> will <b>decree upon you that water will never flow through you.</b> The river <b>parted for him.</b>
There <b>was a certain man who was carrying wheat</b> for the preparation of <i>matza</i> <b>for Passover.</b> Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to</b> the river: <b>Part</b> your waters <b>for that</b> person <b>too, as he is engaged in</b> the performance of <b>a mitzva.</b> The river <b>parted for him.</b> There <b>was a certain Arab [<i>taya’a</i>] who was accompanying them.</b> Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to</b> the river: <b>Part</b> your waters <b>for that</b> person <b>too, so that he will not say: Is that</b> what <b>one does to a person who accompanies</b> him? The river <b>parted for him.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef said: How great is this man,</b> Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir, greater <b>than Moses and</b> the <b>six hundred thousand</b> who left Egypt, <b>as there,</b> at the Red Sea, the waters parted <b>one time, and here</b> the waters parted <b>three times.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And perhaps here too,</b> the waters parted <b>one time,</b> and the river began to flow again only after all three of them passed. <b>Rather,</b> this man was as great <b>as Moses and</b> the <b>six hundred thousand</b> children of Israel.
After crossing the river, Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>happened</b> to come <b>to a certain inn [<i>ushpiza</i>].</b> His hosts <b>cast barley before his donkey</b> for him to eat. The donkey <b>did not eat</b> it.

Daf 7b

The hosts <b>sifted</b> the barley with a utensil, but the donkey <b>did not eat</b> it. <b>They separated</b> the chaff from the barley by hand, but the donkey <b>did not eat</b> it. They wondered why the donkey would not eat the barley. Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to</b> his hosts: <b>Perhaps</b> the barley <b>is not tithed.</b> They <b>tithed it and</b> the donkey <b>ate</b> it. Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said: This poor</b> animal <b>is going to perform the will of its Maker, and you are feeding it untithed produce?</b> Rabbi Zeira was referring to this donkey when it spoke of God preventing mishaps from occurring through animals of the righteous.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is one</b> who purchases grain that is <i>demai</i> in order to feed his animal <b>obligated</b> to tithe it? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 1:3): <b>One who purchases</b> grain in the market <b>for sowing or for</b> feeding <b>an animal, or flour to</b> process animal <b>hides, or oil to</b> kindle <b>a lamp, or oil to smear on vessels is exempt from the</b> obligation of tithing <b><i>demai</i>?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>There, it was stated</b> with regard to that mishna that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one purchased</b> those items <b>initially for the animal</b> or for the other purposes enumerated in the mishna, <b>but</b> if <b>he purchased them initially for a person and reconsidered</b> his plans <b>for them</b> and decided to use them <b>for an animal, he is obligated to tithe</b> the <i>demai</i>. <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in support of that understanding: In the case of <b>one who purchases produce from the market for</b> human <b>consumption, and</b> he <b>reconsidered</b> his plans <b>for it</b> and decided to use it <b>for an animal, that</b> person <b>may neither place</b> it <b>before his animal nor before the animal of another unless he tithed</b> the produce.
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>heard</b> that Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir arrived, and he <b>emerged to greet him.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him:</b> Is it <b>your desire</b> to <b>dine with me?</b> Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to him: Yes. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi’s <b>face beamed [<i>tzahavu</i>],</b> as it was well known that Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir did not accept invitations to dine with others.
Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Are you under the impression that deriving benefit from the Jewish people is forbidden to me by vow?</b> On the contrary, <b>the Jewish people are holy.</b> I avoid accepting invitations, as <b>there is one who wants</b> to invite guests to dine with him <b>but he does not have</b> the means, and I do not want to enjoy a meal that my host cannot afford. <b>And there is one who has</b> the means <b>but does not want</b> to host guests, <b>and</b> with regard to those people <b>it is written: “Eat not the bread of him that has an evil eye, neither desire his delicacies. For as one that has reckoned within himself, so is he: Eat and drink, says he to you; but his heart is not with you”</b> (Proverbs 23:6–7). <b>But you want</b> to invite guests to dine with you, <b>and you have</b> the means.
<b>But now I am rushing [<i>mesarheivna</i>], as I am engaged in</b> the performance of <b>a matter involving a mitzva. When I come back I will enter to</b> dine with <b>you.</b>
<b>When</b> Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>came</b> back, <b>he happened to enter through that entrance in which white mules were standing. He said: The Angel of Death</b> is <b>in this</b> person’s <b>house, and I will eat with him?</b> White mules were known to be dangerous animals.
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>heard</b> the comment of Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir and <b>emerged to greet him. He said to him: I will sell</b> the mules. Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir <b>said to him:</b> You will thereby violate the prohibition: <b>“Nor place a stumbling block before the blind”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), as it is prohibited for any Jew to keep a destructive animal in his possession.
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to him: <b>I will declare</b> the mules <b>ownerless.</b> Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir said to him: <b>You</b> will thereby <b>increase the damage,</b> as there will be no owner to restrain it. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to him: <b>I</b> will <b>remove their</b> hooves so that they will be unable to kick and cause damage. Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir said to him: <b>There is</b> the requirement to prevent <b>suffering to animals,</b> and you will be violating it. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to him: <b>I</b> will <b>kill them.</b> Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir said to him: <b>There is</b> the prohibition: <b>Do not destroy</b> items of value.
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>was greatly imploring him</b> to enter his home until <b>a mountain rose between them</b> and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi could no longer speak with him. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>wept and said: If during their lifetimes</b> it is <b>so</b> that the righteous are great, <b>after their death</b> it is <b>all the more so</b> true. The Gemara comments: This is <b>as Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says: The righteous are greater after their death, more so than during their lifetimes, as it is stated: “And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that they spied a raiding party; and they cast the man into the tomb of Elisha; and as soon as the man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet”</b> (II Kings 13:21).
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> This proof from the case of Elisha that the righteous are greater after death is not valid. <b>And perhaps</b> this transpired <b>to fulfill with regard to</b> Elisha <b>the blessing of Elijah, as it is written: “Please, let a double portion of your spirit be upon me”</b> (II Kings 2:9). Elijah revived one dead person and this one is the second revived by Elisha. Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: <b>If so, is this</b> consistent with that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The dead person <b>arose on his feet but he did not go to his home,</b> indicating that he had not truly been revived?
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is the case, <b>in what</b> manner <b>was</b> Elijah’s blessing <b>fulfilled?</b> It is <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The blessing was fulfilled <b>when he cured the leprosy of Naaman, since</b> a leper <b>is equivalent to a dead person, as it is stated</b> with regard to Miriam when she was afflicted with leprosy: <b>“Please, let her not be as one dead”</b> (Numbers 12:12).
Apropos white mules, which were likened to the Angel of Death, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Why are</b> the mules <b>called <i>yemim</i></b> (see Genesis 36:24)? It is <b>because their terror [<i>eimatam</i>] is cast over</b> all <b>creatures, as Rabbi Ḥanina says: In</b> all <b>my days, no man has asked me about a wound</b> caused him <b>by a white mule and survived,</b> indicating that they are extremely dangerous. The Gemara asks: <b>But haven’t we seen that</b> some people <b>survive</b> after being wounded by a white mule? The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> instead, no man has asked me about a wound caused him by a mule <b>and</b> the wound <b>healed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But haven’t we seen that</b> such wounds <b>heal?</b> The Gemara answers: The wound that <b>we say</b> does not heal is one caused by a mule <b>the top of whose legs are white.</b>
The Gemara relates other statements of Rabbi Ḥanina: With regard to the verse: <b>“There is none else beside Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:35), <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: And even sorcery</b> is ineffective against the will of God. The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain woman who would try to take dust from beneath the feet of Rabbi Ḥanina</b> in order to perform sorcery on him and harm him. Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to her: Take</b> the dust, but <b>the matter will be ineffective for you,</b> as it <b>is written: “There is none other beside Him.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Why</b> is sorcery <b>called <i>keshafim</i>?</b> It is an acronym for <b><i>makhḥishin pamalya shel mala</i>,</b> meaning: <b>That they diminish the heavenly entourage [<i>pamalya</i>],</b> indicating that they function contrary to the will of God. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina is different, as,</b> because <b>his merit is great,</b> sorcery has no effect on him.
<b>And Rabbi Ḥanina says: A person injures his finger below,</b> on earth, <b>only if they declare about him on high</b> that he should be injured, <b>as it is stated: It is of the Lord that a man’s goings are established; and a man, what does he understand of his way</b> (see Psalms 37:23 and Proverbs 20:24). <b>Rabbi Elazar says: The blood of a wound effects atonement like the blood of a burnt offering. Rava said:</b> This is stated <b>with regard to</b> a wound on his <b>right thumb,</b> as one applies force with that thumb and the wound is consequently more severe; <b>and</b> it is also stated <b>with regard to a second wound</b> in the same place before the first has healed, <b>and it is</b> provided <b>that</b> he is wounded while <b>going to</b> perform <b>a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva.</b>
Apropos Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir, the Gemara notes that <b>they said about Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir: In</b> all <b>his days he never broke</b> bread and recited a blessing <b>on a piece of bread that was not his, and from the day that he achieved cognition he did not benefit</b> even <b>from the meal of his father,</b> because he eschewed benefit from everyone.

Daf 8a

§ <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>one heated a knife until</b> it became <b>white hot [<i>libben</i>] and slaughtered</b> an animal <b>with it, his slaughter is valid,</b> as cutting the relevant <i>simanim</i> with the knife’s <b>sharp</b> blade <b>preceded</b> the effect of <b>its white heat.</b> Had the effect of the heat preceded the cutting, the animal would have been rendered a <i>tereifa</i>, an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months, before the slaughter was completed, by searing the windpipe and the gullet. The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t there the sides</b> of the knife, which burn the throat and render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>The area of the slaughter</b> in the throat <b>parts</b> immediately after the incision, and the tissue on either side of the incision is not seared by the white-hot blade.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>one heated a skewer [<i>shappud</i>] until</b> it became <b>white hot and struck</b> a person <b>with it,</b> and after the wound healed a leprous mark developed, is that mark <b>adjudged as</b> a leprous <b>boil or is it adjudged as</b> a leprous <b>burn?</b>
<b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> whether it is adjudged a boil or a burn? The difference is <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Both a leprous <b>boil and</b> a leprous <b>burn become impure during one week</b> of quarantine <b>with two symptoms: With white hair</b> that grows in the leprous mark <b>and with spreading</b> of the leprous mark. <b>And why did the verse divide them</b> into two separate passages even though their halakhic status is the same? The verse divided them <b>to say that they do not join together</b> to constitute the requisite measure of impure leprous marks. Rather, there is impurity only if the boil or the burn constitutes that measure individually.
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which</b> wound <b>is a boil and which is a burn?</b> If <b>one was struck with wood, with a stone, with pomace, with the hot springs of Tiberias, or with any item that is not heated by fire,</b> a phrase that serves <b>to include lead</b> that was mined <b>from its source</b> in the ground, which is occasionally hot enough to burn a person, <b>this</b> impression left on the skin <b>is a boil. And which</b> wound <b>is a burn?</b> If <b>one was burned with a coal, with hot ashes, with boiling limestone, with boiling gypsum [<i>begippesit</i>], or with any item that is heated by fire,</b> a phrase that serves <b>to include</b> water <b>heated by fire, this</b> impression left on the skin <b>is a burn.</b>
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there is <b>a boil and a burn</b> on the same place on the skin and a leprous mark developed, the later wound determines the nature of the leprosy. Therefore, <b>if the boil preceded the burn, the burn nullifies the boil</b> and the mark is a leprous burn. <b>And if the burn preceded the boil, the boil nullifies the burn</b> and the mark is a leprous boil.
<b>And here,</b> where the dilemma was raised whether the mark that develops from being struck with a hot skewer is a boil or a burn, <b>what are the circumstances?</b> It is a case <b>where initially there was a boil half</b> the size of <b>a split bean on</b> the person’s skin, <b>and one heated a skewer until</b> it became <b>white hot and struck</b> him <b>with it, and another</b> mark <b>half</b> the size of <b>a split bean emerged</b> on the skin there.
The Gemara clarifies the dilemma: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Does</b> the effect of <b>the blow come first and</b> then the effect of <b>the heat comes and nullifies</b> the effect of <b>the blow, and it is</b> a half-measure <b>boil and</b> a half-measure <b>burn and they do not join together</b> to constitute a full measure? <b>Or perhaps</b> the effect of <b>the heat comes first and</b> then the effect of <b>the blow comes and nullifies</b> the effect of <b>the heat, and it is</b> a half-measure <b>boil and</b> a half-measure <b>boil and they join together.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from that <b>which Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>one heated a knife until</b> it became <b>white hot and slaughtered</b> an animal <b>with it, his slaughter is valid,</b> as cutting the relevant <i>simanim</i> with the knife’s <b>sharp</b> blade <b>preceded</b> the effect of <b>its white heat. Apparently,</b> the effect of <b>the blow comes first.</b> The Gemara rejects that proof: Cutting with <b>a sharp</b> blade <b>is different</b> from striking with a blunt object, and only in the case of a blade does the cut precede the effect of the heat.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one heated a skewer until</b> it became <b>white hot and struck</b> a person <b>with it</b> and after the wound healed a leprous mark developed, that mark <b>is adjudged as</b> a leprous <b>burn</b> caused <b>by fire. Apparently,</b> the effect of <b>the blow precedes</b> the effect of the burn. The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>There too,</b> the reference is to a case <b>where he stabbed</b> the skin with the skewer, <b>which is</b> the same as cutting with <b>a sharp</b> blade.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says that Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> With regard to <b>a knife</b> used <b>for idol worship,</b> it is <b>permitted to slaughter</b> an animal <b>with it, but</b> it is <b>prohibited to cut meat with it.</b> It is <b>permitted to slaughter</b> an animal <b>with it</b> because slaughtering it <b>is a destructive</b> action vis-à-vis the animal, which is worth more when it is alive. <b>But</b> it is <b>prohibited to cut meat with it,</b> because once the animal is slaughtered, cutting it <b>is a constructive</b> action that renders the meat manageable.
<b>Rava said:</b> There are <b>times when</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal to use a knife used for idol worship, e.g., <b>in</b> the case of an animal that is in <b>danger,</b> meaning that it is about to die. If he does not slaughter the animal it would become an unslaughtered carcass and depreciate in value. <b>And</b> there are times when it is <b>permitted</b> for <b>one who cuts</b> meat to use a knife of idol worship, e.g., <b>in</b> the case of an animal whose <b>thighs are intended to</b> be sent as <b>a gift</b> to a person of stature. Cutting it into pieces would render it unfit for this purpose, thereby diminishing its value.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And derive</b> that <b>it</b> is prohibited to use a knife used for idol worship, not because benefit from it is prohibited, but <b>due to</b> the residue of <b>fat of forbidden</b> carcasses on the knife.

Daf 8b

The Gemara rejects that possibility: Rav Naḥman is referring <b>to</b> the case of <b>a new</b> knife on which there is no residue.
The Gemara challenges: If it is <b>a new</b> knife, <b>both</b> according <b>to Rabbi Yishmael and</b> according <b>to Rabbi Akiva,</b> who disagreed about whether an idol is forbidden from the moment that one crafts it or from the moment that one worships it, a knife is merely in the category of <b>accessories of idol worship, and accessories of idol worship are forbidden only after they are</b> used for idol <b>worship.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the reference is to a case <b>where he cut a branch [<i>gevaza</i>] for idol worship with</b> the knife, which leaves no residue. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that Rav Naḥman is referring <b>to</b> the case of <b>an old</b> knife <b>that he burned until</b> it became <b>white hot in the fire,</b> and therefore, there is no residue on the knife.
§ <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>with the knife of gentiles, Rav says: He peels</b> off a layer of the flesh from the place on the animal where the knife touched the flesh and the forbidden residue on the knife was absorbed. <b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana says: He rinses</b> the place where the knife touched the flesh. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>they disagree about this, that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana, <b>holds: The area of the slaughter</b> on the throat <b>is cold</b> and does not absorb the forbidden residue, and therefore rinsing is sufficient. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds: The area of the slaughter</b> on the throat <b>is hot</b> and therefore it absorbs the forbidden residue.
The Gemara rejects that suggestion: <b>No,</b> it is possible <b>that everyone</b> holds that <b>the area of the slaughter</b> on the throat <b>is hot.</b> For <b>the one who says</b> that <b>he peels</b> off a layer, it works out <b>well, and the one who says</b> that <b>he rinses</b> the place where the knife touched the flesh holds that <b>since the two organs that must be severed in ritual slaughter [<i>simanim</i>],</b> i.e., the windpipe and the gullet, <b>are occupied</b> with <b>discharging blood, they do not absorb</b> the residue.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say that everyone</b> holds that <b>the area of the slaughter</b> on the throat <b>is cold.</b> For <b>the one who says</b> that <b>he rinses</b> the place where the knife touched the flesh, it works out <b>well, and the one who says</b> that <b>he peels</b> off a layer holds that although that area is cold, <b>due to the pressure of the knife</b> on the throat, the flesh <b>absorbs</b> the residue.
§ <b>With regard to a knife</b> with which an animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> was slaughtered, <b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree. One says:</b> One purges it <b>in hot</b> water to remove the absorptions from the <i>tereifa</i>, <b>and one says:</b> One rinses it <b>in cold</b> water, and that is sufficient. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: One may rinse it <b>even in cold</b> water. <b>And if there is a tattered</b> piece <b>of a curtain</b> with which <b>to wipe</b> the knife, <b>one need not</b> rinse it.
<b>And according to the one who says</b> that one purges it <b>in hot</b> water, <b>what is the reason</b> that he must do so; is it <b>due to</b> the premise <b>that</b> the knife <b>absorbed forbidden</b> residue? That reasoning should not be limited to a case where he slaughtered a <i>tereifa</i>. A knife with <b>which</b> he slaughtered an animal that is <b>permitted</b> should <b>also</b> require purging, because <b>it absorbed</b> residue from <b>the limb from a living</b> animal before the slaughter was completed. The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> is there concern that the knife <b>absorbed</b> the residue? It is <b>when</b> the throat <b>grows warm. When does it grow warm?</b> It is <b>at</b> the point <b>when the slaughter is complete.</b> At <b>that moment, it is</b> already <b>permitted.</b>
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: The slaughterer requires three knives, one with which he slaughters</b> the animal, <b>and one with which he cuts meat, and one with which he cuts</b> forbidden <b>fats.</b> One may not use the same knife for cutting the meat and the forbidden fats due to the residue on the knife after cutting the forbidden fats.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let him designate one</b> knife for cutting both the meat and forbidden fats <b>and cut meat with it and then cut</b> forbidden <b>fats with it.</b> In this manner the forbidden residue on the knife will not affect the meat. The Gemara explains: The Sages issued a rabbinic <b>decree</b> prohibiting the use of one knife to cut meat and then forbidden fats <b>lest he</b> also <b>cut</b> forbidden <b>fats and cut meat thereafter.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>Now too,</b> after the decree mandating separate knives there is a concern that <b>they will be confused for him</b> and he will use the knife that cut the forbidden fats to cut the meat. The Gemara explains: <b>Since</b> the Sages <b>required him</b> to have <b>two</b> knives, <b>he has a conspicuous marker</b> on one of the knives that will prevent confusion.
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: The slaughterer requires two vessels of water, one with which he rinses meat and one with which he rinses</b> forbidden <b>fats.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>And let him designate one</b> vessel <b>and rinse meat with</b> the water in the vessel <b>and then rinse</b> forbidden <b>fats with</b> the water in the same vessel. The Gemara explains: The Sages issued a rabbinic <b>decree</b> to prohibit doing so <b>lest he rinse</b> fats <b>and rinse meat thereafter.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>Now too,</b> after the decree mandating separate vessels there is a concern that <b>they will be confused for him</b> and he will rinse meat in the vessel in which he rinsed fats. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the Sages <b>required him</b> to have <b>two</b> vessels, <b>he has a conspicuous marker</b> on one of the vessels that will prevent confusion.
§ <b>Ameimar says in the name of Rav Pappa: A person should not place [<i>lisḥof</i>] the flanks</b> of an animal <b>atop</b> other <b>meat</b> so that the forbidden fats that are attached to the flanks are in contact with the other meat, due to the fact <b>that the</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> liquefies and <b>flows and the meat absorbs</b> it.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>If so,</b> and that is a concern, <b>when</b> the flanks are <b>placed</b> in their <b>typical</b> manner <b>[<i>teritzi</i>] as well,</b> with the forbidden fat above the meat of the flanks, <b>the</b> forbidden <b>fat flows and the meat</b> of the flanks <b>absorbs</b> it. The Gemara explains: <b>The membrane</b> between the forbidden fat and the meat of the flanks <b>interposes from below</b> and prevents absorption of the forbidden fat. The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b>

Daf 9a

<b>from above too there is a membrane</b> that should prevent the forbidden fat from flowing onto the piece of meat even if the forbidden fat is placed directly upon it. The Gemara explains: <b>Since the hand of the slaughterer touches</b> the upper membrane, that membrane <b>disintegrates</b> and the forbidden fat flows onto the meat.
§ <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: A Torah scholar is required to learn</b> the requisite skills to perform <b>three matters: Writing,</b> so that he will be able to write texts on various occasions, <b>ritual slaughter, and circumcision. And Rav Ḥananya bar Shelamya says in the name of Rav:</b> He must <b>also</b> learn to tie <b>the knot of the phylacteries, and</b> to recite <b>the blessing of the grooms</b> by heart and with the traditional intonation, <b>and</b> to tie <b>ritual fringes</b> to the corners of a garment. The Gemara notes: <b>And the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Rav Yehuda, holds that <b>those</b> skills <b>are commonplace</b> and do not require special training.
§ <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>any slaughterer who does not know the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual slaughter,</b> it is <b>prohibited to eat from his slaughter. And these are the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual slaughter: Interrupting</b> the slaughter, <b>pressing</b> the knife, <b>concealing</b> the knife under the windpipe or the gullet in the course of an inverted slaughter, <b>diverting</b> the knife from the place of slaughter, <b>and ripping</b> the <i>simanim</i> from their place before cutting them.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the novelty in what Rav is <b>teaching us? We learned all of them</b> in the <i>mishnayot</i> in the second chapter of this tractate, and therefore it is obvious that a slaughterer who does not know these <i>halakhot</i> is not qualified. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> the slaughterer <b>slaughtered before us twice or three times and slaughtered well. Lest you say: From</b> the fact <b>that he slaughtered the other</b> animals <b>well, this</b> animal <b>he also slaughtered well;</b> therefore, Rav <b>teaches us: Since he did not learn</b> the <i>halakhot</i>, <b>sometimes</b> it happens <b>that he interrupts</b> the slaughter <b>or presses</b> the knife, <b>and he does not know</b> that he invalidated the slaughter.
§ <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: The slaughterer must examine the <i>simanim</i>,</b> the windpipe and the gullet, <b>after</b> completing the <b>slaughter. Rav Yosef said: We learn</b> in a mishna (32a) <b>as well: Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The slaughter is not valid <b>if he interrupted</b> the slaughter for an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of <b>an examination. What, is it not</b> an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of <b>an examination of the <i>simanim</i>?</b> Apparently, one is obligated to examine the <i>simanim</i>.
<b>Abaye said to him: No, this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of <b>an examination</b> of the knife, as the Sages instituted that one must take the knife to be examined by a Torah <b>scholar</b> prior to slaughtering the animal. Rav Yosef said to him: <b>If so, you have rendered your statement</b> subject <b>to circumstances,</b> as sometimes the Torah scholar is near and sometimes the Torah scholar is far, and the time required for examination varies accordingly. <b>Rather,</b> it is an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of <b>an examination</b> performed by <b>a slaughterer</b> who is a Torah <b>scholar.</b> In that case, the travel time is not factored, just the time of the examination, which does not vary.
The Gemara asks: If the slaughterer <b>did not examine</b> the <i>simanim</i> after completing slaughter of the animal, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Antigonus says in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yannai:</b> The halakhic status of the slaughtered animal is that of <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, and it is forbidden for consumption,</b> but it does not impart impurity. <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> Its halakhic status is that of <b>an unslaughtered carcass, and it imparts impurity by means of carrying</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the application of the <i>halakha</i> stated by <b>Rav Huna, who says: An animal during its lifetime exists with the presumptive status of prohibition,</b> as it is prohibited to eat a living animal, and it continues to have this status even after its death <b>until it will become known to you in what</b> manner <b>it was slaughtered,</b> i.e., whether it was properly slaughtered. Once the animal <b>was slaughtered,</b> it exists <b>with the presumptive status of permissibility until it will become known to you in what</b> manner <b>it was rendered a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
It is with regard to the application of this <i>halakha</i> that Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yannai, and the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> disagree in a case where the slaughterer did not examine the <i>simanim</i> after completing the slaughter. One <b>Sage holds:</b> Since it has not been verified that the animal was slaughtered properly, the animal <b>exists with the presumptive status of prohibition, and</b> since <b>now it is dead,</b> it assumes the status of an unslaughtered carcass and imparts impurity. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage holds: With</b> regard to <b>the presumptive status of prohibition, we say</b> that the animal is forbidden until it is verified that it was slaughtered properly; <b>with regard to the presumptive status of ritual impurity we do not say</b> that the animal is impure, as a living animal is not ritually impure.
§ The Gemara proceeds to analyze <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav Huna says: An animal during its lifetime exists with the presumptive status of prohibition until it will become known to you in what</b> manner <b>it was slaughtered.</b> Once the animal <b>was slaughtered, it exists with the presumptive status of permissibility until it will become known to you in what</b> manner <b>it was rendered a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> The Gemara challenges this: <b>And let us say</b> that once the animal <b>was slaughtered, it became permitted,</b> instead of saying that it exists with the presumptive status of permissibility. The Gemara explains: <b>This teaches us that even if a flaw developed in</b> the animal that raises uncertainty with regard to its permitted status, it retains its presumptive status of permissibility.
<b>As Rabbi Abba raised a dilemma before Rav Huna:</b> If <b>a wolf came and took</b> the <b>innards</b> of a slaughtered animal, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara asks: <b>Took?</b> In that case the innards <b>are not</b> there, and therefore there is no way of seeing an indication of a flaw. <b>Rather,</b> the dilemma is: In a case where a wolf <b>perforated the innards</b> of a slaughtered animal, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara challenges: <b>Perforated? We see that</b> the wolf <b>perforated them</b> and in that case too there is no indication of a flaw. <b>Rather,</b> the dilemma is: In a case where a wolf <b>took</b> the innards <b>and returned them when they are perforated, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Are we concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the wolf <b>perforated</b> the innards <b>in the place of</b> a preexisting <b>perforation</b> and the animal was a <i>tereifa</i> from the outset, <b>or</b> is that possibility <b>not</b> a concern?
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>One is not concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the wolf <b>perforated</b> the innards <b>in the place of</b> a preexisting <b>perforation,</b> because one relies on the presumptive status of permissibility.
Rabbi Abba <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rav Huna: If <b>one saw a bird pecking at a fig or a mouse gnawing at melons,</b>

Daf 9b

<b>one is concerned that perhaps</b> the bird or the mouse <b>perforated</b> it <b>in the place of</b> the preexisting <b>perforation</b> caused by a snake, and it is prohibited to eat the fig or the melon, due to the danger that the snake might have left its venom.
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>Are you comparing danger to prohibition? Danger is different,</b> and one rules stringently in cases involving danger. <b>Rava said to him: What is different</b> about the fact that the ruling in cases of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>danger</b> is <b>stringent,</b> given that in cases of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>prohibition</b> the ruling is <b>also stringent?</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>And is there no difference between prohibition and danger? But isn’t</b> it the <i>halakha</i> that in a case of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>ritual impurity in the public domain, its uncertain</b> impurity leaves it <b>pure, while</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>water</b> that is <b>exposed</b> and therefore susceptible to a snake leaving venom in it, the water is <b>forbidden.</b>
Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>There,</b> in the case of ritual impurity in the public domain, the Sages <b>learned this <i>halakha</i> through tradition from</b> the case of <b>a <i>sota</i>,</b> a woman who enters into seclusion with a particular man after her husband warns her not to. She is forbidden to her husband even though there is uncertainty whether or not she committed adultery. <b>Just as a <i>sota</i> is</b> forbidden only in a case of uncertainty <b>in the private domain,</b> as there is no seclusion in the public domain; <b>so too</b> with regard to <b>ritual impurity,</b> one becomes ritually impure in a case of uncertainty only <b>in the private domain.</b>
<b>Rav Shimi raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rava from a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 4:2): If the carcass of <b>a creeping animal</b> was <b>in the mouth of a weasel, and</b> that <b>weasel</b> was <b>walking on loaves of <i>teruma</i>,</b> and there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether the creeping animal <b>touched</b> the loaves and <b>uncertainty</b> whether it <b>did not touch</b> the loaves, <b>its uncertain</b> impurity leaves it <b>pure, while</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>water</b> that is <b>exposed</b> and therefore susceptible to a snake leaving venom in it, the water is <b>forbidden.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>There too, the <i>halakha</i> is derived from</b> the case of <b>a <i>sota</i>. Just as</b> the uncertainty in the case of <b><i>sota</i></b> involves <b>an entity that has consciousness</b> in order for her <b>to be asked</b> whether she was unfaithful and is forbidden to her husband, <b>so too here,</b> only uncertainty involving <b>an entity that has consciousness</b> in order for it <b>to be asked</b> whether the loaves were rendered impure would become impure. The weasel does not have that consciousness.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> additional proof that danger is more severe than prohibition (see mishna <i>Para</i> 11:1): In the case of <b>a flask</b> of purification water <b>that one left exposed and he came</b> back <b>and found it covered,</b> it is <b>ritually impure, as I say: An impure man entered into there and covered</b> it, and in the course of doing so he rendered the vessel and its contents impure.
In a case where <b>one left</b> the vessel <b>covered and came</b> back <b>and found it exposed, if</b> it is in a place where <b>a weasel could drink from it, or a snake according to the statement of Rabban Gamliel, or</b> if there is concern <b>that dew fell into it at night,</b> the purification waters are <b>disqualified</b> for sprinkling in the process of purification of a person impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, due to the concern that the saliva of the weasel or the dew, which are unfit for sprinkling, intermingled with it. Nevertheless, the water is not impure.
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: What is the reason</b> that there is no concern that a ritually impure person exposed the waters and rendered them impure?

Daf 10a

It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is</b> the typical <b>manner of creeping animals to expose</b> the contents of a vessel so that they may drink. Therefore, the exposure of the water is attributed to a creeping animal or to a ritually pure person. By contrast, in a case where he left the vessel exposed and found it covered, the concern is that it was an impure man who covered it, since <b>it is not</b> the typical <b>manner of</b> creeping animals <b>to cover</b> exposed vessels. Evidently, with regard to prohibition or ritual impurity, there are circumstances of uncertainty when the ruling is lenient.
<b>Alternatively,</b> it can be inferred from the <i>baraita</i> that <b>the reason</b> the contents of the vessel are impure or disqualified, respectively, is <b>that he left it exposed and came</b> back <b>and found it covered</b> or that he left it <b>covered and came</b> back <b>and found it exposed. But</b> if <b>he found</b> the vessel just <b>as he left it, there is neither impurity nor disqualification.</b>
<b>But</b> in a situation of <b>uncertainty</b> where he left <b>exposed water</b> and then came and found the vessel exposed, the water is <b>forbidden</b> under all circumstances. <b>Learn from it</b> that <b>danger is more severe than prohibition.</b> The Gemara affirms: Indeed, <b>learn from it.</b>
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Terumot</i> 8:4): <b>Three liquids are forbidden due to exposure: Water, wine, and milk. How long shall they remain</b> exposed <b>and</b> their contents <b>will be forbidden?</b> It is a period <b>equivalent</b> to the time necessary so <b>that a snake could emerge from a proximate place and drink. And how</b> far away is considered <b>a proximate place? Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, said:</b> Even a period <b>equivalent</b> to the time necessary <b>so that</b> a snake <b>could emerge from beneath the handle of the vessel and drink.</b>
The Gemara asks: If it is only the time necessary for the snake to emerge and <b>drink, doesn’t one see</b> the snake drink, in which case there is no uncertainty? <b>Rather,</b> it is a period equivalent to the time necessary for a snake to emerge from a proximate place, <b>drink, and return to its hole.</b> If one left exposed liquid unattended for that interval, it is possible that the snake drank the liquid unseen by the owner of the liquid.
§ <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>with a knife that was</b> afterward <b>found</b> to be <b>notched, Rav Huna says: Even</b> if, after the slaughter and before the knife was examined, <b>he broke bones with</b> the knife <b>all day,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid,</b> as <b>we are concerned that perhaps</b> the knife <b>became notched on the hide</b> of the neck. <b>And Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The slaughter is <b>valid,</b> as <b>perhaps</b> it was <b>on the bone</b> that he broke with the knife after the slaughter that <b>it became notched.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, Rav Huna</b> stated his opinion <b>in accordance with his <i>halakha</i></b> cited earlier (9a): An animal during its lifetime exists with the presumptive status of prohibition until it becomes known in what manner it was slaughtered. <b>But</b> as for <b>Rav Ḥisda, what is the reason</b> for his ruling that the slaughter is valid? The Gemara answers that Rav Ḥisda could have <b>said to you: A bone certainly notches</b> the knife, but with regard to <b>hide,</b> it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it <b>notches</b> the knife and <b>uncertain</b> whether it <b>does not notch</b> it. This <b>is</b> a case of <b>certainty and uncertainty, and</b> the principle is that <b>an uncertainty does not override a certainty.</b>
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda <b>to support</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna,</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one immersed and emerged</b> from the ritual bath <b>and an interposing item was</b> later <b>found on him,</b> then <b>even if he had been engaged in</b> handling <b>that same type</b> of item for <b>the entire day</b> after his immersion, <b>the immersion does not fulfill his</b> obligation. This is so <b>until he will say:</b> It is <b>clear to me that</b> this interposition <b>was not on me beforehand. And here</b> it is a case <b>where he certainly immersed,</b> and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether the interposition <b>was on him</b> at that time and <b>uncertain</b> whether it <b>was not on him, and</b> nevertheless, contrary to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda, the <b>uncertainty overrides</b> the <b>certainty.</b>
The Gemara rejects that proof: It <b>is different there, as it can be said: Establish</b> the status of <b>the impure</b> person <b>on</b> the basis of <b>his presumptive status</b> of impurity, <b>and say</b> that <b>he did not immerse</b> properly.
The Gemara challenges: <b>Here too, establish</b> the status of <b>the animal on</b> the basis of <b>its presumptive status</b> of prohibition <b>and say</b> that <b>it was not slaughtered</b> properly. Why does Rav Ḥisda rule that it is permitted? The Gemara explains: That status has been undermined, as the <b>slaughtered</b> animal <b>is before you.</b> There is no indication that the slaughter was not valid, and most slaughtered animals are slaughtered properly.
The Gemara challenges: <b>Here too,</b> in the case of immersion, the status of impurity is undermined, as the person who <b>has immersed</b> is <b>before you.</b> The Gemara explains: The case of immersion is different, as <b>a flaw developed in</b> the presumptive validity of the immersion, since there is an interposition.
The Gemara challenges: <b>Here too, a flaw developed in</b> the presumptive validity of slaughter, as the knife is notched. The Gemara explains: In the case of slaughter, <b>the knife became flawed,</b> but <b>the animal did not become flawed.</b> Therefore, the animal assumes the presumptive status of permissibility. By contrast, in the case of immersion, the interposition was found on the person, thereby nullifying his presumptive status of purity.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda from a <i>baraita</i>: The slaughter of a bird is valid with the cutting of one <i>siman</i>, the windpipe or the gullet. Therefore, if <b>one cut the gullet, and the windpipe was displaced thereafter,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid.</b> If <b>the windpipe was displaced and one cut the gullet thereafter,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid.</b>
If <b>one cut the gullet, and the windpipe was found displaced, and he does not know whether</b> the windpipe <b>was displaced before the slaughter</b> or <b>whether</b> it <b>was displaced after the slaughter; that was</b> the <b>incident</b> that came before the Sages, <b>and they said:</b> In <b>any</b> case of <b>uncertainty with regard to slaughter,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid.</b>
The Gemara asks: With regard to the expansive formulation: With regard to <b>any</b> case of <b>uncertainty with regard to slaughter, what</b> does it serve <b>to add?</b> Does it <b>not</b> serve <b>to add a case like this</b> one where there is uncertainty whether the knife was notched before or after the slaughter? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it serves <b>to add</b> a case of <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>he interrupted</b> the slaughter in the middle, or <b>uncertainty</b> whether <b>he pressed</b> the knife on the <i>simanim</i>. If he did either, it invalidates the slaughter.

Daf 10b

The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way is uncertainty whether he interrupted the slaughter or pressed the knife <b>different</b> from uncertainty whether the knife became notched before or after the slaughter? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of uncertainty with regard to interruption or pressing, <b>the flaw developed in the animal,</b> and the slaughter is not valid. <b>Here,</b> in the case of uncertainty whether the knife became notched before or after the slaughter, <b>a flaw developed in the knife</b> but <b>a flaw did not develop in the animal,</b> and the slaughter is valid.
<b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna</b> that the slaughter is not valid in a case <b>where he did not break a bone with</b> the knife. <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda</b> that the slaughter is valid in a case <b>where he broke a bone with</b> the knife. Learn <b>by inference that Rav Ḥisda</b> rules that the slaughter is valid <b>even if he did not break a bone with</b> the knife. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if he did not break bones, <b>on what was</b> the knife <b>notched?</b> It must have been on the hide. Why, then, is the slaughter valid? The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that <b>it was notched on the neck bone</b> after he competed slaughtering the animal.
The Gemara relates: <b>There was an incident, and Rav Yosef deemed as many as thirteen animals <i>tereifot</i></b> when he discovered the knife was notched after slaughtering the final animal. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Rav Yosef issue his ruling? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna,</b> who holds that the concern is that the knife was notched by the animal’s hide, <b>and</b> he ruled that <b>even the first</b> animal is forbidden? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> perhaps it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who holds that the notch is attributed to the neck bone, <b>and</b> they are all forbidden <b>except for the first</b> animal.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, as, if</b> it were <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda, since we attribute</b> the notch to the neck bone as a leniency, <b>from where</b> is it ascertained <b>that</b> it is <b>on the neck bone of the first</b> animal that <b>it was notched? Perhaps</b> it is <b>on the neck bone of the last</b> animal that <b>it was notched,</b> and all of the animals are permitted.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: Rav Kahana requires an examination</b> of the knife <b>between each and every</b> act of slaughter. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Rav Kahana issue his ruling? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, and</b> he stated the <i>halakha</i> <b>to invalidate</b> the slaughter of <b>the first</b> animal that he slaughtered if he discovers a notch in the knife? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> perhaps it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> according to the first of the two explanations of the ruling of Rav Yosef, who holds that if a notch is found it is attributed to the neck bone, <b>and</b> examination of the knife is required <b>to validate</b> the slaughter of <b>the next</b> animal.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>If so,</b> and the reference is to the examination before slaughter, the knife <b>should require the examination of a</b> Torah <b>scholar</b> that was required by the Sages. The Gemara explains: There is no need for a Sage to examine the knife, based on the principle: The testimony of <b>one witness,</b> in this case the slaughterer, <b>is deemed credible with regard to ritual matters.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>If so, even from the outset,</b> examination of the knife by a Torah scholar should <b>also not</b> be required. The Gemara explains: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that the Sages <b>said to show</b> the <b>knife to a</b> Torah <b>scholar only due to</b> the requirement to show <b>deference to the Sage?</b> Once deference was shown before the initial slaughter, it is no longer necessary to do so.
§ Apropos the statement of Rav Huna that an animal during its lifetime exists with the presumptive status of prohibition, and therefore in cases of uncertainty whether the animal was properly slaughtered, one rules stringently and it is prohibited to eat its flesh, the Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter that the Sages said: Establish</b> the status of <b>the matter on</b> the basis of <b>its presumptive status,</b> derived?
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to leprosy of houses that after a priest views a leprous mark: <b>“And the priest shall emerge from the house to the entrance of the house, and quarantine the house seven days”</b> (Leviticus 14:38). The Gemara asks: How can the priest quarantine the house based on his viewing the leprous mark? <b>Perhaps as he was emerging and coming</b> out of the house, the size of the leprous mark diminished and <b>it lacks</b> the requisite <b>measure</b> for leprosy. <b>Rather, is it not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Establish</b> the status of <b>the matter on</b> the basis of <b>its presumptive status?</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov objects to</b> that proof: <b>And perhaps</b> the verse is referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>emerged backward, as</b> in that case, the priest <b>sees</b> the leprous mark <b>as he emerges.</b>
<b>Abaye said to him</b> that there are <b>two refutations of</b> that <b>statement. One</b> is <b>that emerging backward is not called emerging,</b> and the priest would not fulfill the verse “And the priest shall emerge from the house” by doing so. <b>And furthermore,</b> in a case where the leprous mark is <b>behind the door, what is there to say?</b> Even walking backward would not enable the priest to see it. <b>And if you would say that</b> the priest can <b>open a window in</b> the wall to enable him to see the leprous mark, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 2:3): <b>In a dark house one may not open windows</b> to enable him <b>to see his leprous mark?</b>
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: With regard to <b>that which you say: Emerging backward is not called emerging,</b> the case of the <b>High Priest on Yom Kippur will prove</b> that this is not so, <b>as emerging is written in his</b> regard (see Leviticus 16:18), <b>and we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 52b): The High Priest <b>emerged and came</b> out backward in the <b>manner of his entry,</b> facing the Ark in the Holy of Holies. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which you say: In a dark house, one may not open windows</b> to enable him <b>to see his leprous mark, this statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where</b> the existence of a leprous mark in the house <b>was not</b> yet <b>established;</b> but in a case <b>where</b> the existence of a leprous mark in the house <b>was</b> already <b>established, it was established,</b> and the priest may open a window to view it.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov,</b> who suggested that the verse is referring to a case where the priest emerged from the house backward and therefore there is no proof that one lets the matter remain in its presumptive status. It is written: <b>“And the priest shall emerge from the house</b> to the entrance of the house and quarantine the house.” One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he may go into his</b> own <b>house and quarantine</b> the house from there; therefore, <b>the verse states: “To the entrance of the house,”</b> referring to the house that is being quarantined.
<b>If</b> he must emerge to <b>the entrance of the house,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he may stand beneath the lintel and quarantine</b> the house; therefore, <b>the verse states: “From the house,”</b> indicating that he does not quarantine the house <b>until he emerges from the house in its entirety. How so? He stands alongside the lintel and quarantines</b> the house.
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if he went inside his</b> own <b>house and quarantined</b> the leprous house, <b>or that</b> if <b>he stood inside the</b> leprous <b>house and quarantined</b> it, <b>that his quarantine is</b> a valid <b>quarantine?</b> It is derived from that which <b>the verse states: “And quarantine the house,”</b> meaning <b>in any case.</b> Apparently, the quarantine is valid even if he is unable to see the leprous mark, as the mark remains in its previous presumptive status.
<b>And Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov</b> interprets the <i>baraita</i> in accordance with his opinion

Daf 11a

in a case <b>where</b> there is <b>a row of standing men,</b> from the house to be quarantined to the priest’s house, <b>and they</b> each <b>say</b> to the one standing next to him that the leprous mark <b>remains standing</b> unaltered.
§ After discussing the role of presumptive status in determining <i>halakha</i>, the Gemara discusses the role of the majority. <b>From where is this matter that the Sages stated: Follow the majority,</b> derived? The Gemara is surprised at the question: <b>From where do we</b> derive it? Obviously, it is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written</b> explicitly: <b>“After the majority to incline”</b> (Exodus 23:2).
The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>a majority that is</b> quantifiable <b>before us, for example,</b> in the case of a piece of meat that was found on the street before ten shops, <b>nine shops</b> selling kosher meat and one shop selling non-kosher meat, one follows the majority and deems that piece kosher. <b>Or</b> when the <b>Sanhedrin</b> adjudicates a case, one follows a majority of the judges in determining the ruling. In these cases, <b>we do not raise the dilemma.</b>
<b>When the dilemma is raised to us</b> it is in the case of <b>a majority that is not</b> quantifiable <b>before us, for example,</b> the case of <b>a minor boy and a minor girl.</b> If the boy entered into levirate marriage with the girl, it is permitted for them to remain married, and there is no concern that when they grow older it will be discovered that the boy or the girl never develop sexually. Rather, one follows the majority, that minors develop sexually at puberty. It is with regard to that non-quantifiable majority that the Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive it?
<b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> an answer to this question. Before presenting his answer, the Gemara cites <b>a mnemonic</b> for the names of the Sages who address this question: <b><i>Zayin</i>,</b> Rabbi Elazar; <b><i>mem</i>,</b> Mar, son of Ravina; <b><i>nun</i>,</b> Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak; <b><i>shin</i>,</b> Rav Sheshet; <b><i>beit</i>,</b> Rabba bar Rav Sheila; <b><i>ḥet</i>,</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov; <b><i>mem</i>,</b> Rav Mari; <b><i>kaf</i>,</b> Rav Kahana; <b><i>nun</i>,</b> Ravina; <b><i>shin</i>,</b> Rav Ashi.
Rabbi Elazar’s answer was as follows: It is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>the head of a burnt offering,</b> that one severs it from the animal’s body but does not cut it into smaller pieces, <b>as the verse states:</b> “And he shall flay the burnt offering <b>and cut it into its pieces”</b> (Leviticus 1:6), and it is inferred: The animal is cut <b>into its pieces, but its pieces,</b> including its head, are <b>not</b> cut <b>into pieces.</b> Rabbi Elazar suggested: <b>And</b> since the head is not cut and cannot be examined, <b>let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps the brain membrane was perforated,</b> which would render the animal a <i>tereifa</i> and unfit for sacrifice. <b>Rather,</b> is the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of animals, which are not <i>tereifot</i>?
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is that conclusion drawn? <b>Perhaps</b> the reference is to a case <b>where one splits</b> the head open <b>and examines</b> the brain membrane. <b>And if</b> that could not be <b>due to</b> the inference: The animal is cut <b>into its pieces, but its pieces</b> are <b>not</b> cut <b>into pieces, that statement</b> applies in a case <b>where one cuts</b> the head <b>completely</b> in half. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where</b> the sides of the head remain <b>joined, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b> Therefore, no proof can be cited from here.
<b>Mar, son of Ravina, said:</b> The fact that we follow a non-quantifiable majority is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the breaking of a bone in the Paschal offering, as the Merciful One states: “Nor shall you break a bone thereof”</b> (Exodus 12:46). Mar, son of Ravina, suggested: <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps the brain membrane was perforated</b> and the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, as it is impossible to examine its brain membrane since one may not break its bones. <b>Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of animals, which are not <i>tereifot</i>?
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is that conclusion drawn? <b>Perhaps</b> the reference is to a case <b>where one places a coal on the head and burns</b> through the head, exposing the brain membrane, <b>and</b> then <b>examines it, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who cuts the sinews or burns the bones</b> of the Paschal offering <b>is not subject to</b> lashes <b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b>breaking bones.</b> Therefore, no proof can be cited from here either.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>tail</b> of a lamb brought as a peace offering, with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states:</b> “And he shall sacrifice of the peace offering…<b>the fat tail whole,</b> which he shall remove opposite the rump bone” (Leviticus 3:9), meaning that the tail must remain intact and may not be cut. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak suggested: <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the segment of <b>the spinal column</b> in the tail <b>was severed</b> prior to slaughter, rendering the animal a <i>tereifa</i> and unfit for sacrifice. <b>Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of animals, which are not <i>tereifot</i>?
<b>And if you would say</b> in rejection of that proof <b>that one severs</b> the tail <b>from below</b> the spine, in a place that would not render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>the Merciful One states: “Opposite the rump bone [<i>he’atze</i>],” the place where the kidneys advise [<i>yo’atzot</i>],</b> This is a location where severing the spinal column renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. Consequently, the proof that the majority is followed remains intact.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is that conclusion drawn? <b>Perhaps</b> the reference is to a case <b>where one splits</b> the tail <b>and examines</b> the spinal column. <b>And if</b> that could not be, <b>due to</b> the requirement that the fat tail remain <b>“whole,” that statement</b> applies in a case <b>where one cuts</b> the tail <b>completely</b> in half. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where</b> the sides of the tail remain <b>joined, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b> Therefore, no proof can be cited from here.
<b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> The principle of following a non-quantifiable majority is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>heifer whose neck is broken</b> when a person is found killed in an area that is between two cities and the murderer is unknown (Deuteronomy 21:1–9). <b>As the Merciful One states:</b> “And all the elders of that city…shall wash their hands over the heifer <b>whose neck was broken,</b> in the valley” (Deuteronomy 21:6), from which it is inferred: Other than its neck being broken, the heifer <b>should remain</b> in a state <b>where it is whole. And</b> if one does not follow the majority, <b>let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the animal <b>is a <i>tereifa</i>. Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of animals, which are not <i>tereifot</i>?
<b>And if you would say</b> in rejection of that proof that there is no need for an examination, as <b>what difference is</b> there whether it is a <i>tereifa</i>, since it is neither eaten nor sacrificed, <b>didn’t they say</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai:</b> A term of <b>atonement is written in its</b> regard (see Deuteronomy 21:8), indicating that the halakhic status of the heifer whose neck is broken is <b>like</b> that of <b>sacrificial</b> animals, and a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit for use in that ritual?
<b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila said:</b> The principle of following an unquantifiable majority is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>red heifer,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states: “And he shall slaughter…and he shall burn”</b> (Numbers 19:3, 5), from which it is derived: <b>Just as its slaughter</b> is performed <b>when it is whole, so too its burning</b> is performed <b>when it is whole. And</b> if the majority is not followed, <b>let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the animal <b>is a <i>tereifa</i>. Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of animals, which are not <i>tereifot</i>?
<b>And if you would say</b> in rejection of that proof that there is no need for an examination, as <b>what difference is</b> there whether it is a <i>tereifa</i>, since it is neither eaten nor sacrificed, <b>the Merciful One called it <i>ḥatat</i>,</b> meaning purification, just as a sin offering is called <i>ḥatat</i>, indicating that in both cases a <i>tereifa</i> is unfit.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> The fact that one follows a non-quantifiable majority is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <b>scapegoat,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One says: “And he shall take the two goats…</b>one lot for the Lord and one lot for Azazel” (Leviticus 16:7–8). From the fact that the verse mentions the two goats together, the Sages inferred <b>that the two</b> goats <b>should be equal. But</b> how can it be ascertained that they are equal; <b>let us be concerned</b>

Daf 11b

that <b>perhaps one of</b> the animals, the scapegoat, <b>is a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Since it is not slaughtered, but is rather cast from a cliff while alive, there is no way to ascertain that it is not a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of animals, which are not <i>tereifot</i>?
<b>And if you would</b> seek to reject that proof and <b>say</b> that there is no need for an examination, as <b>what</b> practical <b>difference is there to us</b> whether it is a <i>tereifa</i>, since it is neither eaten nor sacrificed, and the two goats are fit after the fact even if they are not equal (see <i>Yoma</i> 62a); <b>doesn’t the lot determine</b> the goat <b>for Azazel only with regard to an item,</b> a goat, <b>that is fit</b> for sacrifice <b>to the Lord? And if you would say that we examine</b> the goat after it is cast from the cliff and do not rely on a majority, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 67a): The goat <b>did not reach halfway</b> down <b>the mountain until it was</b> torn <b>limb</b> from <b>limb.</b>
<b>Rav Mari said:</b> The fact that one follows a non-quantifiable majority is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who strikes his father or his mother,</b> with regard to <b>whom the Merciful One states: Kill him</b> (see Exodus 21:15). Rav Mari clarifies: <b>But let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the man that he struck <b>is not</b> actually <b>his father. Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority, and the majority of</b> acts of <b>intercourse</b> performed by a married woman <b>are attributable to the husband.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is that conclusion drawn? <b>Perhaps</b> the reference is to a case <b>where</b> at the time he was conceived <b>his mother and father were incarcerated</b> together <b>in prison.</b> Therefore, the fact that it was his father that he struck is based on certainty, not a majority. The Gemara answers: <b>Even so, there is no steward [<i>apotropos</i>] for</b> restraining <b>sexual immorality,</b> and the identity of his father is not based on certainty.
<b>Rav Kahana said:</b> It is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one who kills</b> another <b>person,</b> with regard to <b>whom the Merciful One states: Kill him</b> (see Exodus 21:12). Rav Kahana clarifies: <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the person that he killed <b>was a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> one who has a wound or condition that will lead to his death within twelve months. One who kills a <i>tereifa</i> is exempt from capital punishment because in that sense, the halakhic status of a <i>tereifa</i> is that of a dead person. <b>Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of people, who are not <i>tereifot</i>?
<b>And if you would</b> seek to reject that proof and <b>say that we examine</b> the corpse to determine whether he was a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>wouldn’t</b> the corpse be <b>mutilated</b> through that examination? <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>due to</b> concern for the possibility of an unjustified <b>loss of life of that</b> murderer, <b>we will mutilate</b> the corpse to determine whether the victim was a <i>tereifa</i>, it would remain necessary to rely on the majority, as <b>let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps there was a perforation in the place</b> that he stabbed the victim with the <b>sword.</b>
<b>Ravina said:</b> It is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>conspiring witnesses,</b> with regard to <b>whom the Merciful One states: “And you shall do unto him as he had conspired</b> to do unto his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19). If the witnesses testified falsely that a person is guilty of a capital offense, they are liable to receive the death penalty. <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps that</b> person <b>against whom they testified was a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> and they should not be executed for conspiring to have a <i>tereifa</i> executed. <b>Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of people, who are not <i>tereifot</i>?
<b>And if you would say</b> in rejection of that proof <b>that we examine</b> the corpse of the executed defendant to determine whether he was a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>a distinguished Sage [<i>beribbi</i>] says</b> with regard to witnesses who conspired to have a person killed based on their testimony: If the conspiring witnesses have <b>not</b> yet <b>killed</b> the accused with their testimony, <b>they are executed;</b> but if <b>they killed</b> the accused with their testimony, <b>they are not executed.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The principle of following a non-quantifiable majority is <b>derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>slaughter itself,</b> with regard to <b>which the Merciful One states: Slaughter</b> the animal <b>and eat</b> it. <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he is slaughtering</b> the animal <b>in the place of</b> a preexisting <b>perforation. Rather, is</b> the reason we are not concerned for this <b>not due to</b> the fact <b>that we say: Follow the majority</b> of animals that are not <i>tereifot</i>?
<b>Rav Ashi said: I stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Kahana, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Kahana</b> stated this <i>halakha</i> <b>before Rav Shimi, and</b> the Sage before whom the <i>halakha</i> was stated <b>said to</b> the one who stated it: <b>And perhaps where</b> it is <b>possible</b> to examine the situation it is <b>possible,</b> and the majority is not followed; but <b>where</b> it is <b>not possible</b> to examine the situation it is <b>not possible,</b> and the majority is followed.
<b>As if you do not say so,</b> then according <b>to Rabbi Meir, who</b> despite the existence of a majority <b>takes the minority into consideration</b> and does not follow the majority, is it <b>indeed</b> true <b>that one does not eat meat</b> due to the concern that there was a perforation in the place that he slaughtered the animal? <b>And if you would say, indeed,</b> according to Rabbi Meir it is prohibited to eat meat,

Daf 12a

then with regard to the <b>Paschal offering and sacrificial</b> meat that one is obligated to eat, <b>what is there to say? Rather,</b> according to Rabbi Meir, there is no alternative to saying: <b>Where</b> it is <b>possible</b> to examine the situation it is <b>possible,</b> and the majority is not followed; <b>where</b> it is <b>not possible</b> to examine the situation it is <b>not possible,</b> and the majority is followed. If so, <b>here too,</b> according to the Rabbis, it cannot be proven from the above sources that one follows a non-quantifiable majority <i>ab initio</i>, as perhaps <b>where</b> it is <b>possible</b> to examine the situation it is <b>possible,</b> and <b>where</b> it is <b>not possible</b> to examine the situation it is <b>not possible,</b> and the majority is followed.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In the case of a person who <b>saw one who slaughtered</b> an animal, <b>if</b> the person <b>saw him</b> slaughtering continuously <b>from beginning to end</b> of the act, he is <b>permitted to eat from his slaughter, and if not,</b> he is <b>prohibited from eating from his slaughter.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the onlooker <b>knows that he is knowledgeable</b> in the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter, <b>why do I</b> require that the onlooker <b>saw</b> the slaughter? Even if he did not see him slaughter, the onlooker may rely on his slaughter. <b>And if</b> the onlooker <b>knows that he is not knowledgeable</b> in the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter, it is <b>obvious</b> that only if the person saw him slaughtering from beginning to end he is permitted to eat from his slaughter.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps it is a case <b>where</b> the onlooker <b>does not know whether he is knowledgeable</b> or <b>whether he is not knowledgeable.</b> But if that is the case, <b>let us say: The majority</b> of those <b>associated with slaughter are experts</b> in the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter, and one may rely on his slaughter.
<b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case <b>where one found a slaughtered chicken in the marketplace, or where one said to his agent: Go out</b> and <b>slaughter</b> a chicken, <b>and he went and found</b> the chicken <b>slaughtered</b> and he does not know who slaughtered it, <b>its presumptive status</b> is that it was <b>slaughtered</b> properly.
<b>Apparently, we say: The majority</b> of those <b>associated with slaughter are experts. Here too,</b> in a case where it is unknown whether he is knowledgeable, <b>let us say: The majority</b> of those <b>associated with slaughter are experts.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the reference is to a case <b>where</b> the onlooker <b>knows that</b> the one slaughtering <b>is not knowledgeable</b> in the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter, <b>and where he slaughtered one <i>siman</i> before us properly. Lest you say: From</b> the fact <b>that this</b> <i>siman</i> was slaughtered <b>properly, that</b> <i>siman</i> was <b>also</b> slaughtered <b>properly;</b> therefore, Rav <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so. As, perhaps <b>this</b> <i>siman</i> <b>happened</b> to be slaughtered properly <b>for him,</b> but with regard to <b>the other</b> <i>siman</i>, <b>perhaps he interrupted</b> the slaughter or <b>perhaps he pressed</b> the knife, invalidating the slaughter.
<b>Rav Dimi bar Yosef raised a dilemma before Rav Naḥman:</b> With regard to <b>one who says to his agent: Go out and slaughter</b> a chicken, <b>and he went and found</b> the chicken <b>slaughtered, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Its presumptive status</b> is that it was <b>slaughtered</b> properly. And he raised another dilemma: With regard to <b>one who says to his agent: Go out and separate <i>teruma</i></b> for me, <b>and he went and found</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> was separated</b> from his produce, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Its presumptive status</b> is <b>not</b> that <b><i>teruma</i> was separated.</b>
Rav Dimi bar Yosef challenged: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, your ruling is problematic. <b>If</b> there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>an agent performs his</b> assigned <b>agency,</b> that should be the case <b>even</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>; and if</b> there is <b>no presumption</b> that <b>an agent performs his</b> assigned <b>agency,</b> there should be <b>no</b> such presumption <b>even</b> with regard to <b>slaughter.</b>
Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Dimi in jest: <b>After you eat a <i>kor</i> of salt over it,</b> and analyze the matter at length, you will be able to understand the difference. <b>Actually,</b> there is <b>no presumption</b> that <b>an agent performs his</b> assigned <b>agency, and</b> in the case of <b>slaughter, even if perhaps another person heard</b> him instruct the agent <b>and</b> that person <b>went</b> and <b>slaughtered</b> the chicken, the slaughter would be valid, because <b>the majority</b> of those <b>associated with slaughter are experts.</b> By contrast, in the case of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> if <b>perhaps another person heard</b> him instruct the agent <b>and</b> then <b>went</b> and <b>separated</b> his <b><i>teruma</i>, he becomes</b> one who <b>designates <i>teruma</i> without</b> the <b>knowledge</b> of the owner of the produce; <b>and</b> with regard to <b>one who designates <i>teruma</i> without</b> the <b>knowledge</b> of the owner of the produce, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is not <i>teruma</i>.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the statement: <b>The majority</b> of those <b>associated with slaughter are experts, is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case <b>where one’s young goats and roosters were lost, and</b> the owner <b>went and found them slaughtered, Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the meat <b>forbidden,</b> and <b>Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, deems</b> it <b>permitted. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears</b> correct in a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>found</b> the slaughtered animals <b>in a scrap heap,</b> as the concern is that they were thrown away because the slaughter was not valid. <b>And the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> appears correct in a case <b>where he found them in the house.</b>
<b>What, is it not with regard to this</b> matter that <b>they disagree, that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>holds: We say</b> that <b>the majority</b> of those <b>associated with slaughter are experts, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds: We do not say</b> that <b>the majority</b> of those <b>associated with slaughter are experts?</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: No,</b> the fact is <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>the majority</b> of those <b>associated with slaughter are experts, and</b> if he found the slaughtered goats or roosters <b>in the house, everyone agrees that</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to eat the meat. If he found them <b>in a scrap heap that</b> is <b>in the marketplace, everyone agrees that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to eat the meat. <b>When they disagree</b> is in a case where he found them <b>in a scrap heap that</b> is <b>in the house.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds: A person is prone to cast his unslaughtered</b> animal <b>carcass onto a scrap heap that</b> is <b>in the house. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>holds: A person is not prone to cast his unslaughtered</b> animal <b>carcass onto a scrap heap that</b> is <b>in the house.</b>
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears</b> correct in a case <b>where he found them in the scrap heap.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the term <b>scrap heap</b> referring to in this context? <b>If we say</b> the reference is to <b>a scrap heap in the marketplace, didn’t you say that everyone agrees that</b> it is <b>prohibited,</b> and it is not merely the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that he found it <b>on a scrap heap that</b> is <b>in the house,</b> and it is in that case that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
<b>Say the latter clause</b> of the statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>And the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> appears correct in a case <b>where he found them in the house. What</b> is the word <b>house</b> referring to in this context? <b>If we say</b> the reference is to <b>an actual house, didn’t you say that everyone agrees that it is permitted? Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that he found it <b>on a scrap heap that</b> is <b>in the house.</b> If so, it is <b>difficult,</b> as there is a contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, where he rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda to prohibit the meat in a case where it is found in a scrap heap in the house, <b>and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, where he rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, to permit the meat in that case.

Daf 12b

The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>is saying: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears</b> correct <b>to Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> in a case where one found them <b>in a scrap heap that</b> is <b>in a marketplace, as Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, disagrees with</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>only</b> in a case where one found them <b>in a scrap heap that</b> is <b>in the house. But</b> in a case where he found them <b>in a scrap heap that</b> is <b>in a marketplace he concedes to</b> Rabbi Yehuda. <b>And</b> the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, <b>appears</b> correct to Rabbi Yehuda in a case where he found them in the house, as he concedes to Rabbi Ḥanina in that case.
§ The mishna stated: Everyone slaughters an animal, i.e., can perform halakhically valid slaughter, and their slaughter is valid, <b>except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, lest they ruin their slaughter.</b> The Gemara infers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach:</b> Due to the concern <b>that they ruined</b> their slaughter, in the past tense; <b>rather,</b> he teaches: <b>Lest they ruin</b> their slaughter, in the future. <b>Rava says: That is to say</b> that <b>one does not give them non-sacred</b> animals for slaughter <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> even with the supervision of others.
The mishna continues: <b>And</b> for <b>all of them, when they slaughtered</b> an animal <b>and others see</b> and supervise <b>them, their slaughter is valid,</b> including even a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, who lack competence and whose intent is not halakhically effective. The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that we do not require intent for slaughter?</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> It <b>is Rabbi Natan, as Oshaya, the youngest of the company</b> of Sages, <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>, stating: If <b>one threw a knife to embed it in the wall, and</b> in the course of its flight the knife <b>went and slaughtered</b> an animal <b>in its</b> proper <b>manner, Rabbi Natan deems</b> the slaughter <b>valid, and the Rabbis deem</b> the slaughter <b>not valid.</b> Oshaya <b>teaches</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>and he states about it: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan</b> that there is no need for intent to perform a valid act of slaughter.
The Gemara asks: How could the slaughter in the <i>baraita</i> be valid? <b>But don’t we require</b> that the slaughterer <b>move</b> the knife <b>back and forth</b> on the throat of the animal? When one throws a knife, it goes in one direction and does not return. The Gemara answers: The case in the <i>baraita</i> is one <b>where the knife went</b> and cut the animal’s throat, caromed off the wall <b>and came</b> back to cut the throat again <b>in its</b> proper <b>manner.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a dilemma:</b> In matters that require thought and intent, <b>does a minor have</b> halakhically effective <b>thought, or does he not have</b> halakhically effective <b>thought?</b>
<b>Rabbi Ami said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raise this dilemma</b> with regard to the <b>action</b> of a minor, whether the action of a minor that indicates intent is effective. <b>What is different</b> about the <b>action</b> of a minor <b>that</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>does not raise a dilemma?</b> Is it due to the fact <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 17:15): A deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor <b>have</b> the capacity to perform <b>an action</b> that is halakhically effective? With regard to <b>thought as well let him not raise this dilemma, as we learned</b> in the same mishna: <b>They do not have</b> the capacity for halakhically effective <b>thought.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in that mishna: With regard to <b>an acorn, a pomegranate, or a nut, which minors hollowed</b> in order <b>to measure dirt with them or that they affixed to a scale,</b> the halakhic status of those shells is that of vessels, and they are <b>susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> By contrast, if the minors merely thought to use the shells for measuring or weighing, unlike adults, they do not thereby render those shells into vessels. The reason for this distinction is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that they have</b> the capacity to perform <b>an action,</b>

Daf 13a

<b>but they do not have</b> the capacity to effect a halakhic status by means of <b>thought.</b>
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ami: With regard to a case of effecting a halakhic status by means of <b>thought alone,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>does not raise a dilemma. When he raises a dilemma,</b> it is with regard to a case where <b>his thought is discernible from his actions.</b>
<b>For example,</b> in a case <b>where</b> an animal that is brought as <b>a burnt offering was standing in the south</b> of the Temple courtyard <b>and</b> a minor <b>took it to the north</b> of the courtyard, the designated place for its slaughter, <b>and slaughtered it</b> there, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Can one conclude <b>from</b> the fact <b>that he took it to the north and slaughtered</b> it there that <b>he had</b> the <b>intent to</b> slaughter the animal for the sake of a burnt offering; <b>or perhaps</b> he moved the animal to the north because <b>a place did not happen</b> to be available <b>for him</b> in the south?
Rabbi Ami asked: But with regard to <b>this</b> matter, <b>too, Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> already <b>said</b> a conclusive resolution <b>one time, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:1): In the case of <b>one who takes his produce up to the roof</b> to protect it <b>from insects, and dew fell upon it,</b> the produce <b>is not in</b> the category of the verse: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed” (Leviticus 11:38), from which it is derived that produce becomes susceptible to ritual impurity only if it is dampened by one of seven liquids and its owner was agreeable to its dampening. <b>And if</b> after taking the produce up to the roof <b>he intended</b> that the produce would be dampened by dew, the produce <b>is in</b> the category of the verse “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed.”
That mishna continues: In a case where <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor took</b> the produce <b>up</b> to the roof, <b>even if they intended</b> that the produce would be dampened by dew, the produce <b>is not in</b> the category of the verse “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed” <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that they have</b> the capacity to perform <b>an action but they do not have</b> the capacity for halakhically effective <b>thought.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the minor <b>did not turn them over. But</b> if <b>he turned them over,</b> indicating that he wants them to be dampened by the dew, the produce <b>is in</b> the category of the verse “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed.” Evidently, Rabbi Yoḥanan rules that when the intention of a minor is apparent from his actions, it is halakhically effective.
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to Rabbi Ami that <b>this</b> is <b>the dilemma</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raises:</b> In a case where the intent of a minor is clear from his actions, is the fact that his thought is effective <b>by Torah law or by rabbinic law?</b> That is one version of the exchange between Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and Rabbi Ami.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak teaches</b> their exchange in <b>this</b> manner. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a minor, does he have</b> the capacity to perform <b>an action</b> that is halakhically effective <b>or does he not have</b> the capacity to perform such <b>an action?</b>
<b>Rabbi Ami said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raise this dilemma</b> with regard to the <b>thought</b> of a minor. <b>What is different</b> about the <b>thought</b> of a minor <b>that</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>does not raise a dilemma?</b> Is it due to the fact <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 17:15): A deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor <b>do not have</b> the capacity for effective <b>thought?</b> With regard to <b>action as well let him not raise this dilemma, as we learned</b> in the same mishna: <b>They have</b> the capacity to perform <b>an action.</b>
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to Rabbi Ami that <b>this</b> is <b>the dilemma</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>raises:</b> Is the fact that their actions are effective and their thought is ineffective <b>by Torah law,</b> and a minor’s action would consequently be effective even with regard to the sacrifice of a burnt offering, <b>or</b> is this fact <b>by rabbinic law</b> and it is merely a stringency? <b>And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>resolves</b> the dilemma: <b>They have</b> the capacity to perform <b>an action and</b> it is effective, <b>even by Torah law.</b> But <b>they do not have</b> the capacity for effective <b>thought, even by rabbinic law.</b> Nevertheless, in a case where <b>his thought is apparent from his actions, by Torah law he does not have</b> effective thought, and <b>by rabbinic law he has</b> effective thought.
§ <b>Shmuel asked Rav Huna: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to one who acts unawares in</b> the slaughter of <b>sacrificial</b> animals, i.e., he slaughtered without intending to perform the act of slaughter at all, <b>that</b> the offering <b>is disqualified?</b> Rav Huna said to him that it is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter the young bull”</b> (Leviticus 1:5), indicating <b>that the slaughter must be for the sake of a young bull,</b> i.e., knowing that he is performing an act of slaughter. Shmuel <b>said to</b> him: <b>we</b> received <b>this</b> as an established <i>halakha</i> already <b>that</b> one must have intent to slaughter the animal <i>ab initio</i>. But <b>from where</b> is it derived that intent to slaughter is <b>indispensable</b> even after the fact? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “You shall slaughter it to your will”</b> (Leviticus 19:5), indicating: <b>Slaughter</b> the animal <b>with your intent,</b> i.e., in the form of a purposeful action.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Slaughter</b> performed by <b>a gentile</b> renders the animal <b>an unslaughtered carcass, and</b> the carcass <b>imparts ritual impurity through carrying.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The slaughter renders the animal <b>an unslaughtered carcass, yes; an item from which</b> deriving <b>benefit is prohibited, no. Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the mishna? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya, son of Rabbi Abba, said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as, if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, doesn’t he say: The unspecified thought of a gentile is for idol worship.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching: Slaughter</b> performed by <b>a gentile</b> renders the animal <b>an unslaughtered carcass, but</b> slaughter performed <b>by a heretic</b> is <b>for</b> the sake of <b>idol worship.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>We learn</b> from an inference in the mishna <b>that which the Sages taught</b> explictly in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Slaughter</b> performed by <b>a heretic</b> is <b>for</b> the sake of <b>idol worship</b> and deriving benefit from it is prohibited, the halakhic status of <b>his bread</b> is that of <b>the bread of a Samaritan,</b> the status of <b>his wine</b> is that of <b>wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> in idol worship, <b>his</b> sacred <b>scrolls</b> that he writes <b>are the scrolls of sorcerers</b> and it is a mitzva to burn them, <b>his produce is untithed produce</b> even if he separated <i>teruma</i> and tithes, <b>and some say: Even</b>

Daf 13b

<b>his sons are <i>mamzerim</i>,</b> as he is indifferent to his wife’s engaging in adultery.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> why did he not include the ruling that the sons of a heretic are <i>mamzerim</i>? The Gemara answers: In his opinion, a heretic <b>does not release his wife</b> and allow her to engage in adultery.
<b>The Master said</b> in the mishna: <b>Slaughter</b> performed by <b>a gentile</b> renders the animal <b>an unslaughtered carcass.</b> The Gemara challenges this: <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he is a heretic</b> who is a devout idolater and deriving benefit from his slaughter is prohibited. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: There are no</b> such <b>heretics among the nations</b> of the world.
The Gemara asks: <b>But don’t we see that there are?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Say the majority of</b> the people of <b>the nations</b> of the world <b>are not heretics,</b> and with regard to slaughter one follows the majority. The Gemara notes: Rabba bar Avuh <b>holds in accordance with that which Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The status of <b>gentiles outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael is <b>not</b> that of <b>idol worshippers,</b> as their worship is not motivated by faith and devotion. <b>Rather, it is</b> a traditional <b>custom of their ancestors</b> that was transmitted <b>to them.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: There are no heretics among the nations</b> of the world, i.e., gentile heretics do not have the halakhic status of actual heretics. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> matter did Rav Naḥman state the <i>halakha</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>with regard to slaughter, now</b> that <b>you said the slaughter of a Jewish heretic is forbidden,</b> is it <b>necessary</b> to say the slaughter <b>of a gentile</b> heretic is forbidden? <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>one lowers</b> them into a pit, i.e., one may kill a heretic, and Rav Naḥman holds that one may not kill them. But this too is difficult, as <b>now</b> if <b>one lowers a Jewish</b> heretic into a pit, is it <b>necessary</b> to say <b>that</b> one lowers <b>a gentile</b> heretic?
<b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said:</b> It is stated <b>with regard to accepting an offering from them, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “When any person of you shall bring an offering” (Leviticus 1:2): The verse states: <b>“Of you,” and not:</b> Of <b>all of you, to exclude the</b> Jewish <b>transgressor</b> who regularly violates a prohibition. Furthermore, God states: <b>“Of you,”</b> to mean that <b>among you,</b> the Jews, <b>I distinguished</b> between a transgressor and other Jews, <b>but not among the nations.</b> One accepts an offering from all gentiles, even a heretic.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> do you draw that conclusion? <b>Perhaps this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying:</b> With regard to offerings <b>from Jews, from righteous</b> Jews <b>accept</b> the offering and <b>from wicked</b> Jews <b>do not accept</b> the offering; <b>but with regard to the nations of the world, do not</b> accept their offerings <b>at all.</b> The Gemara rejects that possibility: That <b>should not enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>] from the house of Israel…who shall sacrifice his offering” (Leviticus 22:18): Since it would have been sufficient to write: <b>A man [<i>ish</i>], what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Any man [<i>ish ish</i>]”?</b> It serves <b>to include the gentiles, who</b> may <b>vow</b> to bring <b>vow offerings and gift offerings like a Jew.</b>
§ The mishna states with regard to an animal slaughtered by a gentile: <b>And</b> the carcass <b>imparts ritual impurity through carrying.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious? Since it is</b> considered <b>an unslaughtered carcass it imparts ritual impurity through carrying. Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is teaching: This</b> slaughtered animal <b>imparts ritual impurity through carrying, and you have another</b> animal <b>that imparts impurity even in a tent,</b> i.e., if one is beneath the same roof with this animal he becomes impure even though he neither touched it nor carried it. <b>And which</b> animal is that? <b>That</b> animal <b>is an idolatrous offering, and</b> this statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira</b> cited below.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> an alternative version of Rava’s statement: <b>Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is teaching: This</b> slaughtered animal <b>imparts ritual impurity through carrying, and you have another</b> animal <b>that is like this</b> one in <b>that</b> it <b>imparts ritual impurity through carrying and does not impart impurity in a tent. And which</b> animal is this? <b>This</b> animal <b>is an idolatrous offering, and</b> this statement is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to an idolatrous offering that it imparts impurity in a tent?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “They adhered to Ba’al-Peor and ate the offerings to the dead”</b> (Psalms 106:28). <b>Just as a corpse imparts impurity in a tent, so too an idolatrous offering imparts impurity in a tent.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>at night, and likewise</b> in the case of <b>the blind</b> person <b>who slaughters</b> an animal, <b>his slaughter is valid.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the formulation of the mishna: <b>One who slaughters,</b> and not: One may slaughter, that with regard to the slaughter of one who slaughters at night, <b>after the fact, yes,</b> it is valid, but <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> one may <b>not</b> do so. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:4): <b>One may always slaughter, both during the day and at night, both on the rooftop and atop a ship,</b> indicating that slaughter at night is permitted <i>ab initio</i>.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> there is <b>a torch opposite</b> the slaughterer; therefore, it is permitted <i>ab initio</i>. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as</b> slaughter at night <b>is taught there</b> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>similar to</b> slaughter <b>during the day,</b> based on the juxtaposition: Both during the day and at night. <b>And here</b> slaughter at night is taught <b>similar to</b> the slaughter performed <b>by a blind</b> person, with no light, based on the juxtaposition: One who slaughters at night, and likewise the blind person who slaughters. Therefore, the slaughter is valid only after the fact. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from it.</b>

Daf 14a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>on Shabbat or on Yom Kippur, although he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>his slaughter is valid.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav taught in the name of Rav:</b> If one slaughtered an animal on Shabbat and Yom Kippur, although the slaughter is valid, <b>consumption</b> of the animal is <b>prohibited for</b> that <b>day, and</b> the members of <b>the company</b> of Sages, i.e., those in the academy, <b>tended to say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? Rabbi Abba said:</b> It <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to preparation</b> for Shabbat, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 156b): <b>One may cut the gourds before an animal</b> on Shabbat, provided that they were picked prior to Shabbat. <b>And</b> likewise, one may cut an animal <b>carcass</b> to place <b>before the dogs</b> on Shabbat. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If it was not</b> already <b>a carcass prior to Shabbat,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to cut it or even move it on Shabbat <b>because it is not prepared</b> for use on Shabbat. <b>Apparently, since it was not prepared from yesterday,</b> it is <b>prohibited. Here too,</b> in the mishna where an animal was slaughtered on Shabbat or Yom Kippur, <b>since it was not prepared from yesterday,</b> it is <b>prohibited.</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>Are</b> the cases <b>comparable? There,</b> in the mishna in tractate <i>Shabbat</i>, <b>initially</b> the animal is <b>prepared for</b> use by <b>a person,</b> as it was prepared for slaughter, <b>and now</b> that it died without slaughter on Shabbat it is <b>prepared for dogs.</b> But in the mishna <b>here, initially</b> the animal is <b>prepared for</b> use by <b>a person and now</b> after it was slaughtered it remains <b>prepared for</b> use by <b>a person.</b> Rabbi Abba rejects that distinction: <b>Do you hold</b> that <b>an animal during its lifetime is designated for consumption</b> and therefore is prepared for use by a person? On the contrary, <b>an animal during its lifetime is designated for breeding.</b>
Abaye asked: <b>If that is so</b> that an animal is not designated for consumption, according <b>to Rabbi Yehuda, how do we slaughter an animal on a Festival?</b> Rabbi Abba <b>said to</b> Abaye: During its lifetime, the animal <b>is designated for consumption and designated for breeding.</b> If it <b>was slaughtered,</b> it is retroactively <b>clarified that it was designated for consumption;</b> if it <b>was not slaughtered,</b> it is retroactively <b>clarified that it was designated for breeding.</b>
<b>But isn’t</b> it so that <b>Rabbi Yehuda does not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>designation? From where do we</b> derive that this is Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion? <b>If we say</b> that we learn it <b>from that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>, there is no proof.
It is taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Demai</i> 8:7): In the case of <b>one who purchases wine from among the Samaritans</b> just before Shabbat, and presumably <i>teruma</i> and tithes were not separated, he acts as follows: If there are one hundred <i>log</i> of wine in the barrels, <b>he says: Two <i>log</i> that I will separate in the future are <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the mandated average measure of <i>teruma</i> is one-fiftieth; <b>ten</b> <i>log</i> are <b>first tithe;</b> and a tenth of the remainder, which is <b>nine</b> <i>log</i>, are <b>second tithe. And he deconsecrates</b> the second tithe that he will separate in the future, transferring its sanctity to money, <b>and</b> he may <b>drink</b> the wine <b>immediately,</b> relying on the separation that he will perform later, which will clarify retroactively which <i>log</i> he designated for the tithes and for <i>teruma</i>. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> this practice. Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda does not accept the principle of retroactive designation.

Daf 14b

The Gemara comments: That is no proof, as <b>there, the reason</b> for the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda is <b>as is taught</b> in the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>: The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Meir: Don’t you concede</b> that <b>perhaps the wineskin will burst</b> before he manages to separate the <i>teruma</i>, <b>and</b> this person <b>will have been found retroactively</b> to be <b>drinking untithed produce?</b> Rabbi Meir <b>said to</b> the Rabbis: The mere possibility that this may occur is not a concern. <b>When it</b> actually <b>bursts,</b> I will be concerned. Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is not due to his rejection of the principle of retroactive designation, but due to his concern that the wineskin will burst before the tithes are actually separated.
<b>Rather,</b> the fact that Rabbi Yehuda does not accept the principle of retroactive designation is learned <b>from that which Ayo teaches</b> with regard to the joining of Shabbat boundaries in a case where one knows that two Torah scholars are planning to deliver lectures on Shabbat outside the city limits, one east of the city and one west of the city, and on Shabbat eve one has not yet decided which of the lectures he wishes to attend. In that case, he may place the food for the joining of boundaries on both sides of the city and stipulate that he will be able to go beyond the city limits in whichever direction he chooses.
<b>As Ayo teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A person may not stipulate</b> that his joining of the boundaries will take effect <b>on two matters as one. Rather,</b> he may stipulate that <b>if</b> one <b>Sage comes to the east, his joining</b> of the boundaries takes effect <b>to the east,</b> and if he comes <b>to the west, his joining</b> takes effect <b>to the west, while</b> if he stipulates that it should take effect <b>to here or to there</b> and he will go in whichever direction he chooses, in that case, the joining does <b>not</b> take effect.
<b>And we discussed</b> this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is different</b> in a case where one stipulates that it should take effect <b>to here or to there</b> such <b>that</b> the joining does <b>not</b> take effect? It is <b>because there is no</b> retroactive <b>designation.</b> If so, stipulating that the joining will take effect to the <b>east or west,</b> depending upon where the Sage goes, should <b>also</b> not take effect <b>because there is no</b> retroactive <b>designation.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is a case <b>where</b> when he makes the stipulation, <b>the Sage has already come</b> to either the east or the west, and the joining takes effect in that direction. He makes a stipulation because he does not know where the Sage came. The joining takes effect without the principle of retroactive designation. Nevertheless, since it is clear from the first case of Ayo that Rabbi Yehuda does not accept the principle of retroactive designation, the question remains: From where is it derived that an animal that is slaughtered on Shabbat or Yom Kippur is forbidden for the day that it was slaughtered?
<b>Rather, Rav Yosef said:</b> When Rav said that the <i>halakha</i> that consumption of the animal is prohibited for that day is the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, the reference <b>is</b> to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to vessels, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 124b): With regard to <b>all vessels that may be moved on Shabbat, their shards may be moved</b> as well, <b>provided that they are suited for</b> some <b>type of labor. Shards of</b> a large <b>bowl</b> may be used <b>to cover the mouth of a barrel. Shards of a glass</b> vessel may be used <b>to cover the mouth of a cruse.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: And</b> it is permitted to use the shards <b>provided that they are suited for a type of labor</b> similar to <b>their</b> original use. In the case of <b>shards of</b> a large <b>bowl,</b> it must be possible <b>to pour</b> a thick <b>broth into them,</b> and in the case of <b>shards of a glass</b> vessel, it must be possible <b>to pour oil into them.</b>
The Gemara infers: If they are suited for <b>a type of labor</b> similar to <b>their</b> original use, <b>yes,</b> they may be moved; but if they are suitable for <b>another type of labor,</b> they may <b>not</b> be moved. <b>Apparently, since</b> the shard <b>was not prepared from yesterday for this</b> type of <b>labor,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to move it. <b>Here too, since</b> the animal that was slaughtered <b>was not prepared from yesterday,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to eat it.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Are</b> the cases <b>comparable? There,</b> in the mishna with regard to vessels, <b>initially</b> it was <b>a vessel and now</b> it is <b>the shard of a vessel, and it is</b> a case of an item that <b>came into being, and</b> it is therefore <b>prohibited</b> to move it. <b>Here,</b> in the case of an animal slaughtered on Shabbat, <b>initially,</b> during its lifetime, it was designated as <b>food, and ultimately,</b> after slaughter, it is <b>food,</b> so it <b>is</b> merely <b>food that was separated [<i>de’ifrat</i>].</b>
<b>And we heard</b> that it is <b>Rabbi Yehuda who says: Food that was separated</b> is <b>permitted, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 143b): <b>One may not squeeze fruits</b> on Shabbat in order <b>to extract liquids from them. And if</b> liquids <b>seeped out on their own, it is prohibited</b> to use them on Shabbat, lest one come to squeeze fruit on Shabbat.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the fruits were designated <b>for eating,</b> the liquid <b>that seeped from them</b> on Shabbat <b>is permitted. And if</b> the fruits were designated <b>for</b> their <b>liquids,</b> the liquids <b>that seeped from them</b> on Shabbat <b>are forbidden,</b> lest he come to squeeze them on Shabbat. With regard to fruits that are designated for consumption, the liquid is considered food that was separated and is permitted. The same <i>halakha</i> applies with regard to an animal slaughtered on Shabbat: Since it was designated for consumption, its meat is food that was separated and should be permitted according to Rabbi Yehuda.
The Gemara rejects that interpretation and states that, on the contrary, there is proof that Rabbi Yehuda would prohibit eating an animal that was slaughtered on Shabbat. <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to</b> that mishna that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Rabbi Yehuda conceded to the Rabbis in</b> the case of <b>baskets of olives and grapes</b> that are typically designated for their liquids, even though one had planned to eat them, that liquid that seeps from them is forbidden?
<b>Apparently, since</b> olives and grapes are typically <b>designated for squeezing,</b> one <b>sets his mind</b> to use them for their liquids, and were it permitted for him to use their liquids that seep out on Shabbat, the concern is that he will come to squeeze them on Shabbat. Therefore, the Sages decreed that the liquids are forbidden. <b>Here too, since</b> the animal is <b>designated for slaughter,</b> a person <b>sets his mind</b> to eat it. Therefore, were it permitted for him to eat the meat on Shabbat, the concern is that he will come to slaughter it on Shabbat. Consequently, the Sages decreed that the meat is prohibited.
The Gemara justifies Abaye’s interpretation of the mishna: <b>This explanation is</b> valid <b>only according to Rav,</b> who said that the ruling that it is prohibited to eat an animal slaughtered on Shabbat until after Shabbat is according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>Didn’t Rav say: Rabbi Yehuda was in disagreement</b> with the Rabbis <b>even in</b> the case of <b>baskets of olives and grapes?</b> According to Rav himself, just as Rabbi Yehuda deems permitted liquids that seeped from olives and grapes on their own, Rabbi Yehuda should have also deemed an animal that was slaughtered on Shabbat permitted for that day.
<b>Rather, Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> When Rav said that the <i>halakha</i> that it is prohibited to consume the animal that day is the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, the reference <b>is</b> to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to lamps, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may move,</b> for purposes other than lighting it, <b>a new</b> earthenware <b>lamp</b> that was never used. <b>But</b> one may <b>not</b> move <b>an old</b> lamp covered with residue of oil and soot, because a person sets it aside from use due to repugnance. Since it was set aside at the beginning of Shabbat, it is set aside for the entire Shabbat and it may not be moved even if a need to move it arises; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The same <i>halakha</i> applies with regard to an animal slaughtered on Shabbat: Since it was prohibited when Shabbat began as the limb of a living being, it remains prohibited for the entire Shabbat.
The Gemara rejects that analogy. <b>Say that you heard Rabbi Yehuda</b> rule that it is prohibited for the entire Shabbat <b>in</b> a case where it is <b>set aside due to repugnance,</b> like the old lamp. <b>Did you hear</b> that <b>he</b> said that it is prohibited for the entire Shabbat in a case where it is <b>set aside due to a prohibition,</b> like the animal? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b>

Daf 15a

<b>One may move all metal lamps</b> on Shabbat, even old ones, because they do not become repugnant like earthenware lamps, <b>except for</b> a metal <b>lamp that one kindled on that same Shabbat</b> and that was burning when Shabbat began, which it is prohibited to move for the entire Shabbat due to the prohibition against extinguishing.
The Gemara rejects that analogy. <b>And perhaps</b> it <b>is different there,</b> in the case of the burning lamp, <b>as he set it aside by</b> direct <b>action</b> when he kindled the lamp. By contrast, in the case of an animal, he did not set it aside, and therefore, perhaps once it is slaughtered it is permitted.
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said:</b> When Rav said that the <i>halakha</i> that consumption of the animal is prohibited for that day is the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, the reference <b>is</b> to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to one who cooks, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who cooks on Shabbat,</b> if he did so <b>unwittingly, he may eat</b> what he cooked. If he acted <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> what he cooked. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he cooked the food <b>unwittingly, he may eat</b> it <b>at the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> as the Sages penalized even one who sinned unwittingly by prohibiting him from deriving immediate benefit from the dish that he cooked. If he cooked it <b>intentionally, he may never eat</b> from it.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar says:</b> If he acted <b>unwittingly,</b> the food <b>may be eaten at the conclusion of Shabbat by others, but not by him.</b> If he cooked the food <b>intentionally, it may never be eaten, neither by him nor by others.</b> According to Rav, the mishna is referring to a case where one slaughtered the animal unwittingly. According to Rabbi Yehuda, the slaughter is valid but it is prohibited to eat the animal on Shabbat.
The Gemara challenges this: <b>And let us interpret</b> the mishna as referring <b>to</b> a case where he slaughtered the animal <b>intentionally, and</b> explain that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who rules that eating the animal in such a case is permitted only after the conclusion of Shabbat.
The Gemara responds: That possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as</b> the case of slaughter on Shabbat is juxtaposed to and <b>taught</b> in a manner <b>similar to</b> the case of slaughter on <b>Yom Kippur. Just as</b> with regard to slaughter on <b>Yom Kippur,</b> it <b>is no different</b> whether one slaughtered it <b>unwittingly and</b> it <b>is no different</b> whether he slaughtered it <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> it that day due to the fast, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to slaughter on Shabbat, it <b>is no different</b> whether he slaughtered it <b>unwittingly and</b> it <b>is no different</b> whether he slaughtered it <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> it that day. Rabbi Meir, though, deems it permitted for one who cooked unwittingly to eat the cooked food on Shabbat.
The Gemara asks: <b>And can you interpret</b> the mishna as referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>unwitting</b> slaughter <b>and</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? But isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna: <b>Although he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty? One is liable to be executed only if he intentionally performs labor on Shabbat. The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Although</b> if he slaughtered it <b>intentionally he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>here,</b> in a case <b>where</b> he slaughtered the animal <b>unwittingly, his slaughter is valid.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>And let us interpret</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar, who says:</b> It <b>is no different</b> whether he cooked <b>unwittingly and</b> it <b>is no different</b> whether he cooked <b>intentionally; he may not eat it</b> on Shabbat. The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar draws a distinction with regard to the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> in that he permits eating food cooked on Shabbat <b>for others and not for him,</b> while <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>teaches: His slaughter is valid,</b> without qualification, indicating that with regard to his ruling it <b>is no different for him and</b> it <b>is no different for others.</b>
§ <b>The <i>tanna</i> taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav: One who cooks on Shabbat unwittingly may eat</b> the food that he cooked; if he did so <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> the food that he cooked, <b>and Rav silenced him.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>Rav silenced him? If we say</b> it is <b>because</b> Rav <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and the <i>tanna</i> taught</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> can it be that merely <b>because he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda he silences one who teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b>
<b>And furthermore, does</b> Rav <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? But doesn’t Rav Ḥanan bar Ami say: When Rav issues a ruling to his students, he issues a ruling in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and when he teaches in</b> his <b>public lecture</b> delivered on the Festival, <b>he teaches in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, due to</b> his concern that <b>the ignoramuses</b> would treat the prohibition of labor on Shabbat with disdain?
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>the <i>tanna</i> taught</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>before</b> Rav <b>during the public lecture</b> and Rav silenced him so that the ignoramuses would not learn from him, <b>is that to say</b> that <b>everyone</b> attending the public lecture <b>listens to the <i>tanna</i></b> who is citing the <i>baraita</i>? There is no need to silence the <i>tanna</i>, because <b>they listen to the disseminator [<i>amora</i>],</b> the Sage who repeats what he hears from Rav loudly for the benefit of those attending the lecture, and the <i>amora</i> quoted Rav’s ruling in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The <i>tanna</i> taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> of one who <b>slaughters before Rav: One who slaughters</b> an animal <b>on Shabbat unwittingly may eat</b> from the slaughtered animal; if he slaughtered it <b>intentionally, he may not eat</b> from the slaughtered animal. Rav <b>said to</b> the <i>tanna</i>: <b>What do you think,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir? Rabbi Meir deems</b> eating <b>permitted only in</b> the case of <b>one who cooks</b> unwittingly on Shabbat, <b>as</b> even before he cooks the food <b>it is fit to be chewed [<i>lakhos</i>],</b> i.e., to be eaten uncooked, in a permitted manner, and therefore it was not set aside from use when Shabbat began. <b>But</b> in the case of one who <b>slaughters</b> an animal, <b>where</b> the meat was <b>not fit to chew,</b> Rabbi Meir does <b>not</b> permit eating it on Shabbat, because it was set aside from use on Shabbat.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t the mishna</b> addressing the case <b>of one who slaughters</b> an animal, <b>and Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav taught in the name of Rav: Consumption</b> of the animal is <b>prohibited for</b> that <b>day, and</b> the members of <b>the company</b> of Sages, i.e., those in the academy, <b>tended to say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> from which it may be inferred: <b>But Rabbi Meir permits</b> consumption of the slaughtered animal even on Shabbat, and he is not concerned that the animal was set aside from use when Shabbat began?
The Gemara answers: <b>When Rabbi Meir permits</b> consumption of the slaughtered animal even on Shabbat,

Daf 15b

it is in a case <b>where one had</b> a critically <b>ill</b> person in his household <b>while it was still day,</b> before Shabbat, as it is permitted to slaughter the animal for such a person even on Shabbat. Therefore, the unslaughtered animal was not set aside from use.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what is the reason that Rabbi Yehuda prohibited</b> consumption of the meat on Shabbat? The Gemara answers: He issued this ruling in a case <b>where one had</b> a critically <b>ill</b> person in his household before Shabbat <b>and</b> that person <b>recovered.</b> In that case, although the unslaughtered animal was not set aside from use when Shabbat began, it is prohibited to slaughter it on Shabbat. According to Rabbi Yehuda, if he slaughtered it unwittingly, its consumption is prohibited on Shabbat.
<b>And</b> that which Rav silenced the <i>tanna</i> for not stating that an unslaughtered animal is set aside from use, even when the prohibited labor of slaughter was performed unwittingly, is <b>in accordance with that which Rav Aḥa bar Adda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> it is that which <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Adda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>to</b> feed <b>an ill</b> person <b>on Shabbat,</b> it is <b>prohibited for a healthy</b> person to partake of the slaughtered animal on Shabbat. In a case of <b>one who cooks</b> food <b>to</b> feed <b>an ill</b> person <b>on Shabbat,</b> it is <b>permitted for a healthy</b> person to partake of that food.
<b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? <b>This</b> food <b>was fit to be chewed</b> before it was cooked, and therefore it was not set aside from use when Shabbat began, <b>and</b> the meat of <b>that</b> animal <b>was not fit to be chewed</b> before the animal was slaughtered, and therefore it was set aside from use when Shabbat began.
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> There are <b>times when one slaughters</b> for an ill person on Shabbat and it is <b>permitted</b> for a healthy person to eat the meat on Shabbat, such as <b>where he had</b> a critically <b>ill</b> person in his household before Shabbat and the animal was designated for slaughter <b>while it was still day,</b> before Shabbat; in that case, it was not set aside from use. And there are times when one <b>cooks</b> on Shabbat for an ill person and it is <b>prohibited</b> for a healthy person to eat the food on Shabbat, such as <b>where one cut a gourd</b> that was attached to the ground <b>for</b> the ill person on Shabbat. Because it is prohibited to detach the gourd on Shabbat, it is set aside from use and forbidden.
<b>Rav Dimi of Neharde’a says</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is: In the case of <b>one who slaughters for an ill</b> person <b>on Shabbat,</b> it is <b>permitted for a healthy</b> person <b>to</b> eat the <b>raw meat [<i>be’umtza</i>]. What is the reason</b> that it is permitted? <b>Since it is impossible for an olive-bulk of meat</b> to be permitted <b>without slaughter</b> of the entire animal, <b>when he slaughters</b> the animal, <b>he slaughters</b> it <b>with the ill</b> person <b>in mind.</b> Since slaughter of the animal was permitted, all its meat is permitted even for a healthy person. In the case of <b>one who cooks for an ill</b> person <b>on Shabbat,</b> it is <b>prohibited for a healthy</b> person to eat the food on Shabbat. What is the reason that it is prohibited? It is due to a rabbinic <b>decree lest he increase</b> the amount of food that he is cooking <b>on behalf of</b> the healthy person.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>with</b> the smooth side of <b>a hand sickle,</b> which has both a smooth and a serrated side, or <b>with</b> a sharpened <b>flint, or with a reed</b> that was cut lengthwise and sharpened, <b>his slaughter is valid.</b>
<b>All slaughter [<i>hakkol shoḥatin</i>], and one may always slaughter, and one may slaughter with any</b> item that cuts, <b>except for</b> the serrated side of <b>the harvest sickle, a saw, the teeth</b> of an animal when attached to its jawbone, <b>and a fingernail, because</b> they are serrated and <b>they</b> consequently <b>strangle</b> the animal and do not cut its windpipe and gullet as required.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara notes that the language of the mishna, which states: <b>One who slaughters</b> an animal with a hand sickle, with a flint, or with a reed, rather than: One may slaughter, indicates that <b>after the fact, yes,</b> the slaughter is valid, but one may <b>not</b> slaughter with those blades <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> one may not slaughter it <b>with a hand sickle, lest he come to perform</b> the slaughter <b>with the other,</b> serrated, <b>side; but</b> as <b>a flint and a reed</b> have no serrated side, is it so that one may <b>not</b> slaughter with those <b><i>ab initio</i>? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may slaughter with any</b> item that cuts, <b>whether with a flint, or with glass</b> shards, <b>or with the stalk of a reed.</b>
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. There,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> permits slaughter <i>ab initio</i>, it is referring to slaughter with a flint and a reed <b>when</b> they are <b>detached. Here,</b> where the mishna says that the slaughter is valid only after the fact, it is referring to slaughter with a flint and a reed <b>when</b> they are <b>attached</b> to the ground, <b>as Rav Kahana says:</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters with</b> a blade that is <b>attached to the ground, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>deems</b> the slaughter <b>not valid and Rabbi Ḥiyya deems</b> it <b>valid.</b> The Gemara infers: Even <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya deems</b> the slaughter <b>valid only after the fact; but</b> one may <b>not</b> do so <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>
<b>In accordance with which</b> opinion <b>did you interpret</b> the mishna? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya, and</b> the slaughter is valid <b>after the fact? But</b> if so, with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may slaughter with any</b> item that cuts, <b>whether with</b> a blade that is <b>detached</b> from the ground <b>or with</b> a blade that is <b>attached</b> to the ground, <b>whether the knife is above and the neck of the animal is below or the knife is below and the neck of the animal is above;</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is it? It is in accordance <b>neither</b> with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>nor</b> with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya. If</b> one would claim that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> he says: <b>After the fact, yes,</b> the slaughter is valid, but it is <b>not</b> permitted to slaughter in this manner <b><i>ab initio</i>. If</b> one would claim that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, he says: <b>Even after the fact,</b> the slaughter is <b>not</b> valid.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya, and</b> he permits slaughter with these blades <b>even <i>ab initio</i>. And</b> the fact <b>that</b> the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Ḥiyya were formulated such that they <b>disagree</b> concerning the <i>halakha</i> <b>after the fact</b> is <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi that the slaughter is not valid even after the fact.
<b>But rather, the mishna</b> here, <b>which teaches:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughters, after the fact, yes,</b> it is valid, but it is <b>not <i>ab initio</i>,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is it? It is in accordance <b>neither</b> with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>nor</b> with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya. If</b> one would claim that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> he says: The slaughter is permitted <b>even <i>ab initio</i>. If</b> one would claim that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, he says: <b>Even after the fact,</b> the slaughter is <b>not</b> valid.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> holds that it is permitted to slaughter with these blades, <b>and even <i>ab initio</i>; and the mishna</b> here, <b>which teaches: One who slaughters, is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
The Gemara objects: This is <b>difficult,</b> as there is a contradiction <b>between</b> one statement of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, as in his dispute with Rabbi Ḥiyya he holds that the slaughter is not valid. The Gemara answers: This contradiction is <b>not difficult. There,</b> in his dispute with Rabbi Ḥiyya, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that slaughter is not valid in a case <b>where</b> the blade was <b>attached from the outset; here,</b> in the mishna, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi deems the slaughter valid after the fact in a case <b>where</b> the blade was <b>detached and ultimately he reattached it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do you say that</b> there is <b>a difference for us between</b> a blade that was <b>attached from the outset</b> and a blade that was <b>detached and ultimately he reattached it? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who slaughters with a mechanism [<i>bemukhni</i>]</b> of a wheel with a knife attached to it, <b>his slaughter is valid; with</b> an item that is <b>attached to the ground, his slaughter is valid;</b> if <b>one embedded a knife in a wall and slaughtered with it, his slaughter is valid.</b> If there <b>was a flint emerging from a wall or a reed arising</b> from the ground <b>on its own and he slaughtered with it, his slaughter is not valid.</b>

Daf 16a

Ostensibly, the two clauses of the <i>baraita</i> are <b>difficult,</b> as they contradict <b>each other,</b> since the first clause states that slaughter with a blade that is attached is valid and the latter clause states that slaughter is not valid. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it</b> that there is <b>a difference between</b> a case where the blade was <b>attached from the outset and</b> a case where the blade was <b>detached and ultimately he reattached it?</b> The Gemara affirms: Indeed, <b>learn from it.</b>
§ <b>The Master said:</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters with a mechanism</b> of a wheel with a knife attached to it, <b>his slaughter is valid.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>his slaughter is not valid?</b> The Gemara answers: This contradiction is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which rules that the slaughter is valid, is <b>in</b> a case where the knife was attached to <b>a potter’s wheel,</b> whose movement is generated by the potter pressing on a pedal. Since the slaughter was performed by the force of the person’s actions, the slaughter is valid. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which rules that the slaughter is not valid, is <b>in</b> a case where the knife was attached to <b>a waterwheel.</b> Since the slaughter was not performed by the force of the person’s actions, the slaughter is not valid.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: The rulings of both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are <b>in</b> a case where the knife was attached to <b>a waterwheel, and</b> the contradiction is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which rules that the slaughter is valid, is in a case where the movement of the slaughter was generated <b>by primary force,</b> as the person releases the water that turns the wheel, and on that initial turn of the wheel the knife slaughters the animal. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which rules that the slaughter is not valid, is in a case where the slaughter was generated <b>by secondary force,</b> as the knife slaughters the animal on the second turn of the wheel.
<b>And</b> this is <b>like that which Rav Pappa says:</b> In the case of <b>a certain</b> person <b>who bound another and diverted a flow [<i>bidka</i>] of water upon him and he died,</b> the one who diverted the water is <b>liable</b> for his murder. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is because those were <b>his arrows that were effective in his</b> murder. <b>And this matter</b> applies in a case where he killed the other person <b>by primary force,</b> as the person was proximate to him and was directly drowned by the water. <b>But</b> if the person was further away and was killed <b>by secondary force</b> after the water flowed on its own, it is not by his direct action; rather, <b>it is merely an indirect</b> action, and he is exempt.
§ <b>Rav sat behind Rabbi Ḥiyya, and Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> sat <b>before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>sat and said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that slaughter is</b> performed specifically <b>with</b> a blade that is <b>detached?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And Abraham stretched forth his hand <b>and took the knife to slaughter</b> his son” (Genesis 22:10). <b>Rav said to Rabbi Ḥiyya: What is he saying?</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to</b> Rav: <b>He is saying</b> an incorrect reason, comparable to the letter <b><i>vav</i> that is written on</b> the rough surface of <b>a tree trunk [<i>a’ufta</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>say a verse</b> as proof for his statement? The Gemara answers: <b>The verse teaches us the diligence of Abraham,</b> who had a knife prepared to slaughter Isaac. It does not teach any <i>halakha</i> concerning ritual slaughter.
§ Apropos the issue of slaughter with a detached blade, <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>obvious to me</b> that concerning an item that was <b>detached and ultimately one attached it,</b> with regard <b>to the matter of idol worship</b> its halakhic status <b>is</b> that of <b>a detached</b> item, <b>as the Master says: One who bows to his house has rendered it forbidden</b> as an object of idol worship. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that its halakhic status <b>is</b> that of an <b>attached</b> item, it is written with regard to idolatry: <b>“Their gods, upon the high mountains”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:2), from which it is derived: <b>But the mountains are not their gods,</b> as items attached to the ground are never rendered forbidden as objects of idol worship. The halakhic status of a house built from stones that were detached is that of a detached item.
With regard <b>to the matter of rendering seeds susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, there <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 4:3): In the case of <b>one who places a bowl on the wall</b> while it is raining <b>so that</b> the bowl <b>will be rinsed</b> with the rainwater, if the water from the bowl then falls onto produce, <b>that is under</b> the rubric of the verse: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed” (Leviticus 11:38). The water has the halakhic status of a liquid that he poured of his own volition on fruit and seeds. Consequently, it renders them susceptible to ritual impurity. But if he placed the bowl there <b>so that the wall will not be damaged, it is not under</b> the rubric of the verse “but <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed.” Since he had no intent to use the water, it is not considered to have entered the bowl of his own volition, and it does not render produce susceptible to impurity.
<b>This</b> mishna <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as the inferences from the first clause and the latter clause are contradictory. In the first clause <b>you said:</b> In the case of one who places a bowl on the wall <b>so that</b> the bowl <b>will be rinsed</b> with the rainwater, <b>that is under</b> the rubric of the verse “but <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed,” and the water renders produce susceptible to impurity. By inference, if he placed the bowl <b>so that the wall will be rinsed</b> by means of the bowl, <b>that is not under</b> the rubric of the verse “but <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed.” That water would not render produce susceptible to impurity, because the intent was for the water to rinse the wall, which is an item attached to the ground.
<b>And then</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in the latter clause: If he placed the bowl <b>so that the wall will not be damaged, it is not under</b> the rubric of the verse: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed.” By inference, if he placed the bowl <b>so that the wall will be rinsed, that is under</b> the rubric of the verse: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed,” as a wall has the status of a detached item, since it was built from stones that were detached.
<b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> This mishna is <b>disjointed;</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>who taught this</b> first clause <b>did not teach that</b> second clause. There is a tannaitic dispute whether the status of a wall that is built from detached stones is that of an attached item or a detached item. <b>Rav Pappa said: The entire</b> mishna <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>one <i>tanna</i>: This</b> first clause is <b>in</b> the case of <b>the wall of a cave,</b> which is attached from the outset; <b>that</b> latter clause is <b>in</b> the case of <b>the wall of a building,</b> which is built from stones that were detached from the ground.
<b>And this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> In the case of <b>one who places a bowl on the wall so that</b> the bowl <b>will be rinsed</b> with the rainwater, <b>that is under</b> the rubric of the verse “but <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed,” and the water renders produce susceptible to impurity. By inference, if he placed the bowl <b>so that the wall will be rinsed</b> by means of the bowl, <b>that is not under</b> the rubric of the verse “but <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed.”
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>in</b> the case of <b>the wall of a cave,</b> which was always attached to the ground. <b>But in</b> the case of <b>the wall of a building,</b> whose stones were detached and subsequently reattached, if he places the bowl <b>so that the wall will not be damaged,</b> that <b>is when</b> it is <b>not under</b> the rubric of the verse “but <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed.” <b>But</b> if he places the bowl <b>so that the wall will be rinsed, that is under</b> the rubric of the verse “but <b>when</b> water <b>is placed</b> upon the seed.”
<b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b>

Daf 16b

In the case of a blade that was <b>detached and ultimately one attached it, with regard to slaughter, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If there <b>was a flint emerging from a wall or a reed arising</b> from the ground <b>on its own and he slaughtered with it, his slaughter is not valid.</b> Since the wall itself was made from stones that were detached and subsequently reattached, the slaughter is not valid.
The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>What are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing <b>with</b> the case of <b>the wall of a cave</b> that was always attached. The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise</b> in support of that explanation, <b>as</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the case of the flint emerging from a wall juxtaposed to, and therefore <b>similar to,</b> the case of <b>a reed arising</b> from the ground <b>on its own,</b> which was also always attached. The Gemara affirms: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that this is the case.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one embedded a knife in a wall and slaughtered with it, his slaughter is valid.</b> The knife was detached and then reattached, and the slaughter is valid. The Gemara rejects the proof: The reason that the slaughter is valid is that <b>a knife is different, as he does not subsume it</b> to the wall.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from an earlier point in that <i>baraita</i>: If one slaughtered <b>with</b> an item that is <b>attached to the ground, his slaughter is valid.</b> This is a case where it was detached and then attached, as later in the <i>baraita</i> a case is cited when the blade was always attached and the slaughter is not valid. The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>Perhaps</b> the phrase that follows in the <i>baraita</i>: If one embedded a knife in a wall, <b>is explaining</b> the previous case. And accordingly, <b>what</b> is the meaning of <b>attached to the ground?</b> It is in the case of <b>a knife, as he does not subsume it</b> to the wall. But if he embedded a flint in a wall and slaughtered with it, his slaughter would be valid. Therefore, there is no proof from this <i>baraita</i>.
§ <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one embedded a knife in a wall and slaughtered with it, his slaughter is valid. Rav Anan says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case where <b>the knife is above and</b> the <b>animal’s neck is below,</b> and he raises the animal’s head and draws it back and forth on the blade. But in a case where the <b>knife is below and</b> the <b>animal’s neck is above,</b> the slaughter is not valid because <b>we are concerned lest he press</b> the knife, due to the weight of the animal, thereby cutting the <i>simanim</i> without drawing the knife back and forth, which invalidates the slaughter.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> explicitly in the <i>baraita</i>: With any item that cuts, one may slaughter, whether with a blade that is attached to the ground or with a blade that is detached from the ground; <b>whether the knife is below and</b> the <b>neck of the animal is above or the knife is above and</b> the <b>neck of the animal is below?</b>
<b>Rav Zevid said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught disjunctively:</b> In the case where the <b>knife is below and</b> the <b>neck of the animal is above,</b> the slaughter is valid <b>when</b> the blade is <b>detached.</b> In the case where the <b>knife is above and</b> the <b>neck of the animal is below,</b> the slaughter is valid even <b>when</b> the blade is <b>attached. Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> that teaches that one may slaughter even when the attached knife is below is referring <b>to</b> slaughter of <b>a bird, which is light,</b> and there is no concern that the weight of the bird will cause the slaughterer to press the bird’s neck onto the knife.
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: Five matters were said with regard to the stalk of a reed,</b> which is used for cutting due to its sharpness. <b>One may neither slaughter with it,</b> due to the concern that splinters will be separated and become embedded in the <i>simanim</i>, invalidating the slaughter; <b>nor circumcise with it</b> for the same reason, due to the potential danger; <b>nor cut meat with it,</b> lest splinters become embedded in the meat and endanger one who eats it; <b>nor pick</b> one’s <b>teeth with it,</b> lest he wound himself; <b>nor wipe with it</b> after relieving oneself.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: One may neither slaughter with it. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>With any</b> sharp object <b>one may slaughter</b> an animal, <b>whether with a flint, or with glass</b> shards, <b>or with the stalk of a reed? Rav Pappa said:</b> There, the reference is <b>to</b> a specific type of <b>reed</b> that grows <b>in a marsh,</b> which becomes a smooth, hard surface when it dries.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>Nor cut meat with it. Rav Pappa cuts with</b> the stalk of a reed <b>the innards of fish, which are transparent,</b> such that any splinters would be obvious. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna cuts with it</b> the meat of <b>a bird, which is soft</b> and will not cause the stalk of the reed to splinter.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>Nor wipe with it</b> after relieving oneself. The Gemara objects: <b>Derive</b> that one may not wipe with it <b>because the Master said: One who wipes with an object that is flammable, his</b> lower <b>teeth,</b> i.e., the rectum that holds the intestines in place, <b>fall out. Rav Pappa said</b> in explanation: The reference in the <i>baraita</i> is not to wiping after relieving oneself. Rather, <b>we are speaking</b> with regard to <b>wiping</b> the blood or dirt from <b>the opening of a wound.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>All slaughter [<i>hakkol shoḥatin</i>] and one may always slaughter.</b> The Gemara interprets the phrase: <b>All slaughter [<i>hakkol shoḥatin</i>],</b> to mean <b>all</b> animals are included in the mitzva <b>of slaughter, and even a bird.</b>
With regard to the statement: <b>One may always slaughter, who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabba said:</b> It <b>is Rabbi Yishmael, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“When the Lord your God shall expand your border, as He has promised you, and you shall say: I will eat flesh…</b>you may eat flesh with all the desire of your soul” (Deuteronomy 12:20), <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: The verse comes only to permit</b> consumption of the non-sacrificial <b>meat of desire to</b> the Jewish people.
<b>As, at the outset,</b> the <b>meat of desire was forbidden to them,</b> and anyone who wanted to eat meat would sacrifice the animal as an offering. After the priest sprinkled the blood, it was permitted for one to eat the meat. <b>When they entered into Eretz</b> Yisrael, the <b>meat of desire was permitted for them,</b> and they could slaughter and eat meat wherever they chose.
Rabba added: <b>And now that</b> the Jewish people <b>were exiled, might</b> one have thought that <b>they return to their initial prohibition? Therefore, we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One may always slaughter</b> non-sacrificial meat.
<b>Rav Yosef objects to this.</b> If so, <b>this</b> phrase: <b>One may always slaughter,</b> is inappropriate; the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> taught: <b>One may always slaughter and eat,</b> as the matter of permission primarily relates to eating the meat, not to slaughtering the animal. <b>And furthermore, initially, what is the reason</b> that the meat of desire <b>was forbidden?</b> It was <b>because</b> in the wilderness, <b>they were proximate to the Tabernacle</b> and could partake of sacrificial meat from the table of God. <b>And ultimately, what is the reason</b> that the meat of desire <b>was permitted?</b> The reason was <b>that</b> in Eretz Yisrael <b>they were distant from the Tabernacle.</b>

Daf 17a

<b>And,</b> if so, <b>all the more so now,</b> in exile, <b>when they are</b> even <b>more distant</b> from the Temple, the meat of desire should be permitted. Consequently, it is unnecessary for the mishna to teach this <i>halakha</i>.
<b>Rather, Rav Yosef said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> who teaches this <i>halakha</i> <b>is Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“If the place that the Lord your God shall choose to put His name there be too far from you, then you shall slaughter of your herd and of your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21), <b>Rabbi Akiva says: The verse comes only to prohibit for them</b> consumption of <b>meat</b> of an animal killed by means <b>of stabbing</b> rather than valid slaughter, <b>as, initially,</b> the <b>meat of stabbing was permitted for them. When they entered into Eretz</b> Yisrael, the <b>meat of stabbing was forbidden to them,</b> and it was permitted to eat the meat of an animal only after valid slaughter.
Rav Yosef added: <b>And now that</b> the Jewish people <b>were exiled, might</b> one have thought that stabbed animals <b>are restored to their initial permitted</b> state? <b>Therefore, we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One</b> must <b>always slaughter</b> the animal to eat its meat.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Akiva holds:</b> The <b>meat of desire was not forbidden at all, and Rabbi Yishmael holds:</b> The <b>meat of stabbing was not permitted at all.</b>
The Gemara asks a series of questions: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who holds that the meat of stabbing was forbidden in the wilderness, <b>that is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> with regard to the burnt offerings sacrificed in the Tabernacle: <b>“And he shall slaughter the young bull”</b> (Leviticus 1:5). <b>But according to Rabbi Akiva, what</b> is the meaning of: <b>“And he shall slaughter”?</b> Why would he slaughter it if stabbing is permitted? The Gemara answers: <b>Sacrificial</b> animals <b>are different,</b> as slaughter is required in that case. By contrast, there was no obligation to slaughter non-sacrificial animals to eat their meat.
<b>Granted, according to Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who holds that the meat of stabbing was forbidden in the wilderness, <b>that is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Will flocks and herds be slaughtered for them”</b> (Numbers 11:22), indicating that they slaughtered the animals in the wilderness. <b>But according to Rabbi Akiva, what</b> is the meaning of: <b>“Will flocks and herds be slaughtered for them”?</b> Ostensibly, the words: <b>Be stabbed for them, should have</b> been written. The Gemara answers: In the wilderness, <b>their stabbing is their slaughter.</b>
<b>Granted, according to Rabbi Yishmael, that is</b> the meaning of that <b>which we learned</b> in a mishna (85a) with regard to the mitzva of covering the blood of an undomesticated animal or a bird: <b>One who slaughters</b> an undomesticated animal and the slaughter is not valid <b>and it became an unslaughtered carcass by his hand, and one who stabs</b> an animal, <b>and one who rips</b> the <i>simanim</i> from their place before cutting them, invalidating the slaughter, is <b>exempt from covering</b> the blood. One must cover the blood of only an animal whose slaughter was valid. <b>But according to Rabbi Akiva, why is one exempt from covering</b> the blood of an animal that was stabbed, since in his opinion when they were commanded to cover blood, animals that were stabbed were permitted?
The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the meat of stabbing <b>was forbidden, it was forbidden,</b> and the halakhic status of stabbing is no longer that of slaughtering.
<b>Granted, according to Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that the <b>meat of desire was not forbidden at all, that is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> before they entered Eretz Yisrael: <b>“However, as the gazelle and as the deer is eaten, so shall you eat of it,</b> the pure and the impure may eat of it alike” (Deuteronomy 12:22). This means that just as it is permitted to eat the meat of a gazelle and a deer in the wilderness in a state of ritual impurity, so may you eat them when you enter Eretz Yisrael, although at that point it will be prohibited to stab them and eat their meat, as their meat will be permitted only through slaughter. <b>But according to Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who holds that the meat of desire was forbidden in the wilderness, <b>were the gazelle and the deer themselves permitted</b> in the wilderness? They are not brought as offerings.
The Gemara answers: <b>When the Merciful One rendered</b> the meat of desire <b>forbidden,</b> that was specifically the meat of <b>a domesticated animal that is fit for sacrifice. But the Merciful One did not render forbidden undomesticated animals that are not fit for sacrifice.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma</b> according to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, who says that the meat of stabbing was permitted in the wilderness: With regard to <b>the limbs of</b> the <b>meat of stabbing that the Jewish people took with them into Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>what is</b> their halakhic status?
The Gemara asks: <b>When?</b> With regard to what period does Rabbi Yirmeya raise his dilemma? <b>If we say</b> that the dilemma is <b>with regard to</b> the <b>seven</b> years during <b>which they conquered</b> the land, <b>now, non-kosher items were permitted for them</b> during that period, <b>as it is written:</b> “And it shall be, when the Lord your God shall bring you into the land that He swore to your fathers, <b>and houses full of all good things…</b>and you shall eat and be satisfied” (Deuteronomy 6:10–11), <b>and Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says: Cuts of pig</b> meat <b>[<i>kotlei daḥazirei</i>]</b> that they found in the houses were permitted for them; is it <b>necessary</b> to say that the <b>meat</b> from the <b>stabbing</b> of a kosher animal was permitted?
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yirmeya’s dilemma is with regard to the period <b>thereafter. And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> his dilemma is <b>with regard to</b> the <b>seven</b> years during <b>which they conquered</b> the land, as perhaps <b>when</b> the forbidden food <b>was permitted for them,</b> it was specifically food from <b>the spoils of gentiles,</b> but <b>their own</b> forbidden food <b>was not permitted.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Rabba says: You explained</b> the phrases in the mishna: <b>All slaughter, and: One may always slaughter.</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>do you explain</b> the phrase: <b>One may slaughter with any</b> item that cuts?
<b>And if you would say</b> that it means: <b>Whether with a flint, or with glass</b> shards, <b>or with the stalk of a reed, but isn’t</b> this phrase <b>taught</b> in a manner <b>similar to those</b> other phrases in the mishna? <b>If these</b> phrases: All slaughter, and: One may always slaughter, are referring <b>to those that slaughter, this</b> phrase <b>too</b> is referring <b>to those that slaughter; and if those</b> phrases are referring <b>to those that are slaughtered, this</b> phrase <b>too</b> is referring <b>to those that are slaughtered.</b> The first two phrases in the mishna were explained as referring to the animals that are slaughtered. The first phrase was interpreted to include birds, and the second phrase was interpreted as referring to the <i>halakha</i> that meat may be eaten only through slaughter of the animal.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the entire mishna is referring to those that slaughter. The initial phrase means <b>everyone [<i>hakkol</i>] slaughters.</b> Although an identical phrase was used in the first mishna (2a), both are necessary: <b>One is to include a Samaritan and one is to include a Jewish transgressor.</b> The second phrase: <b>One may always slaughter,</b> means <b>both during the day and at night, both on a rooftop and atop a ship,</b> and there is no concern that it will appear that he is slaughtering in an idolatrous manner to the hosts of heaven or to the god of the sea. The phrase: <b>One may slaughter with any</b> item that cuts, means: <b>Whether with a flint, or with glass</b> shards, <b>or with the stalk of a reed.</b>
The mishna states: <b>Except for</b> the serrated side of <b>the harvest sickle, and the saw. Shmuel’s father</b> would <b>notch</b> a knife <b>and send</b> it to Eretz Yisrael to ask if it is fit for slaughter, and would <b>notch</b> a knife in a different manner <b>and send</b> it to Eretz Yisrael in order to determine the type of notch that invalidates slaughter. <b>They sent to him</b> from Eretz Yisrael that the principle is: <b>We learned</b> that the notch that invalidates slaughter is <b>like a saw,</b> whose teeth point upward, as it rips the <i>simanim</i> with every draw of the knife back and forth.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 17b

The status of <b>a knife in which there are several notches is considered like</b> that of <b>a saw; and</b> with regard to a knife <b>in which there is only one notch,</b> if it <b>catches,</b> the slaughter is <b>unfit,</b> but if it <b>entangles [<i>mesukhsekhet</i>],</b> the slaughter is <b>fit. What are the circumstances</b> of a notch that <b>catches,</b> and <b>what are the circumstances</b> of a notch that <b>entangles? Rabbi Eliezer said:</b> A notch that <b>catches</b> is one that has a sharp edge <b>on two sides,</b> while a notch that <b>entangles</b> is one that has a sharp edge <b>on one side.</b>
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>What is different</b> about a notch with a sharp edge <b>on two sides, where the first edge [<i>moresha</i>] compromises</b> the neck by removing the hide and the flesh, <b>and the latter edge rips</b> the <i>simanim</i>; in the case of a notch with a sharp edge <b>on one side too, the sharp</b> tip <b>of the knife compromises</b> the neck and <b>the edge</b> of the notch <b>rips</b> the <i>simanim</i>. The Gemara explains: The reference is to a notch <b>that stands at the top of the knife,</b> which begins the slaughter. The Gemara objects: <b>Ultimately, when</b> the knife <b>goes</b> in one direction <b>it compromises</b> the neck and <b>when it comes</b> back in the other direction <b>it rips</b> the <i>simanim</i>. The Gemara explains: The reference is to a case <b>where he drew the knife backward and did not draw it forward.</b>
<b>Rava says:</b> There are <b>three types</b> of notches <b>in a knife.</b> If the notch <b>catches, one may not slaughter</b> with it, <b>and if he slaughtered, his slaughter is not valid.</b> If the notch <b>entangles, one may not slaughter with it <i>ab initio</i>; and if he slaughtered</b> with it, <b>his slaughter is valid</b> after the fact. If the notch <b>rises and falls in</b> the <b>knife</b> and has no sharp edges, <b>one may slaughter with it <i>ab initio</i>.</b>
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Neḥemya, said to Rav Ashi: You said to us in the name of Rava</b> that if the notch <b>entangles,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid. But doesn’t Rava say:</b> If the notch <b>entangles,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid?</b> Rav Ashi answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where Rava says that the slaughter is not valid, is in a case <b>where he drew the knife back and forth. There,</b> where Rava says that the slaughter is valid, is in a case <b>where he drew the knife backward and did not draw it forward.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi:</b> If the knife was <b>similar to an awn</b> of grain <b>[<i>sasa</i>],</b> which is not perfectly smooth but does not have actual notches, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Who will give us from the meat of</b> an animal slaughtered with that knife, <b>and we will eat</b> it.
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that examination of a knife</b> is an obligation <b>by Torah law?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to Saul’s instructions to the people: <b>“And slaughter with this and eat”</b> (I Samuel 14:34), indicating that Saul gave them the knife only after ensuring that it was fit to slaughter their animals.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that a knife must be examined before slaughter? <b>Since were one to create a perforation</b> in the gullet, the animal would be a <b><i>tereifa</i>,</b> therefore the knife <b>requires examination</b> to prevent that situation. The Gemara answers: <b>We are saying</b> that a source for the <i>halakha</i> that one must show the knife <b>to</b> a Torah <b>scholar</b> for examination is needed. The Gemara asks: Is that an obligation by Torah law? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that the Sages <b>said to show</b> the <b>knife to</b> a Torah <b>scholar only due to</b> the requirement to show <b>deference to</b> the Torah <b>scholar?</b> The Gemara answers: Indeed, it is a requirement <b>by rabbinic law, and the verse is</b> cited as <b>a mere support</b> for that practice, not as a source.
The Gemara notes: <b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they examine</b> the knife <b>in the sun</b> to determine whether there is a notch. <b>In Neharde’a they examine</b> the knife <b>with water.</b> They would place the blade on the surface of the water, and if there was a notch, it would noticeably alter the surface of the water. <b>Rav Sheshet would examine it with the tip of his tongue. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov would examine it with a strand of hair.</b> He would pass the strand over the blade of the knife and if there was a notch, it would be caught in that notch.
<b>In Sura they say:</b> The knife <b>consumes the flesh; let the flesh examine</b> the knife. Since the concern is that the knife will rip the flesh during the slaughter, it should be examined by passing it on the tongue or the fingertip. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The knife <b>requires examination on the flesh, and on the fingernail, and on the three sides</b> of the knife, i.e., the blade and the two sides of the knife.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Rav Sama, son of Rav Mesharshiyya, said to us in your name that</b> which <b>you said to him in the name of Rava:</b> The knife <b>requires examination on the flesh, and on the fingernail, and on the three sides.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Ravina: <b>On the flesh and on the fingernail I said, and on the three sides I did not say. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rav Ashi said to him: <b>On the flesh and on the fingernail and on the three sides I said,</b> and <b>in the name of Rava I did not say.</b>
<b>Ravina and Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, were sitting before Rav Ashi.</b> People <b>brought a knife before Rav Ashi to examine it.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to Rav Aḥa, son of Rava: Examine it. He examined it on the fingernail, and on the flesh, and on the three sides.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Well done, and Rav Kahana likewise said</b> that this is the way to examine a knife.
<b>Rav Yeimar said:</b> Examination <b>on the fingernail and on the flesh is necessary,</b> and examination <b>on the three sides is not necessary. Doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>one heated a knife until</b> it became <b>white hot and slaughtered</b> an animal <b>with it, his slaughter is valid, as its sharp</b> blade <b>preceded</b> the effect of <b>its white heat; and</b> it is <b>difficult for us: But aren’t there</b> the <b>sides</b> of the knife, which burn the throat and render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>And we say: The area of the slaughter</b> in the throat <b>separates</b> quickly after the incision, and the tissue on either side of the incision is not seared by the white hot blade. <b>Here too, the area of slaughter separates</b> quickly, and notches on the side of the knife do not come in contact with the <i>simanim</i>.
§ <b>Rav Huna bar Rav Ketina says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says</b> that <b>there are three deficiencies</b> with the same measure, as follows: <b>The deficiency of a bone in the Paschal offering,</b> with regard to which it is written: “Neither shall you break a bone therein” (Exodus 12:46); <b>the deficiency of an ear in a firstborn</b> animal that renders it blemished and unfit for sacrifice, in which case a priest may slaughter it anywhere and eat it; and <b>the deficiency</b> that constitutes <b>a blemish in</b> other forms of <b>sacrificial</b> animals.
<b>And Rav Ḥisda says:</b> There is <b>the deficiency of a knife as well.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, why does he not include the knife? The Gemara answers: He does not include it because <b>he is not speaking with regard to non-sacred</b> animals.
Rav Ḥisda continues: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of</b> these deficiencies, <b>the measure of their deficiency</b> is <b>equivalent to</b> the measure of <b>deficiency</b> that renders <b>the altar</b> unfit.

Daf 18a

<b>And how much</b> is <b>the deficiency</b> that renders <b>the altar</b> unfit? It is a deficiency that is <b>sufficient for a fingernail to be impeded on it.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How much</b> is <b>the deficiency</b> that renders <b>the altar</b> unfit? <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says:</b> One <b>handbreadth. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> One <b>olive-bulk.</b> The Gemara answers: This apparent contradiction is <b>not difficult. This</b> measure of one handbreadth or one olive-bulk is referring to a deficiency <b>in the limestone</b> coating of the altar; <b>that</b> smaller measure of a fingernail being caught is referring to a deficiency <b>in the stone</b> of the altar.
§ Apropos the obligation to show the knife to a Torah scholar, <b>Rav Huna says: This slaughterer who did not present [<i>sar</i>] the knife before</b> a Torah <b>scholar, we ostracize him. And Rava says: We remove him</b> from his position <b>and we proclaim about meat</b> from an animal <b>that he</b> slaughtered <b>that it is <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And they do not disagree. Here,</b> where Rav Huna says that he is ostracized, it is <b>in</b> a case <b>where his knife was discovered intact,</b> and he is ostracized for treating the scholar with contempt. <b>There,</b> where Rava says that his slaughter is proclaimed <i>tereifa</i>, it is <b>in</b> a case <b>where his knife was discovered not intact,</b> as in that case the meat from all animals that he slaughtered is suspect. <b>Ravina said:</b> In a case <b>where his knife was discovered not</b> to be <b>intact, one spreads excrement on</b> the flesh so <b>that even to a gentile it</b> will <b>not be sold.</b>
There was <b>a certain slaughterer who did not present his knife before Rava bar Ḥinnana.</b> Rava bar Ḥinnana <b>ostracized him, and removed him</b> from his position, <b>and proclaimed about meat</b> from an animal <b>that he</b> slaughtered <b>that it is <i>tereifa</i>. Mar Zutra and Rav Ashi happened before</b> Rava bar Ḥinnana in his place of residence. Rava bar Ḥinnana <b>said to them: Let the Sages examine the matter of</b> the slaughterer, <b>as small children are dependent upon him.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi examined his knife and it was discovered intact, and he deemed</b> his meat <b>fit</b> for consumption. <b>Mar Zutra said to</b> Rav Ashi: <b>And shouldn’t the Master be concerned for</b> the honor of <b>the elder,</b> Rava bar Ḥinnana, who removed him from his position and you restored him? Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Mar Zutra: <b>We are carrying out his agency,</b> as he requested that we examine the matter of the slaughterer.
§ <b>Rabba bar Huna says: With a detached tooth and a detached fingernail, it is permitted to slaughter <i>ab initio</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (15b): <b>Except for the harvest sickle, and the saw, and the teeth, and the fingernail, because they strangle?</b>
The Gemara answers that the contradiction between this statement with regard to <b>a tooth and</b> that statement with regard to <b>a tooth</b> is <b>not difficult: This</b> statement of Rava bar Huna that one may slaughter with a tooth is referring to slaughter <b>with one</b> tooth. <b>That</b> mishna that prohibits slaughter with teeth is referring to slaughter <b>with two</b> teeth, as due to the gap between them they rip the <i>simanim</i>. The contradiction between the statement with regard to <b>a fingernail and</b> the statement with regard to <b>a fingernail</b> is <b>not difficult: This</b> statement of Rava bar Huna that one may slaughter with a fingernail is referring to slaughter <b>with a detached</b> fingernail. <b>That</b> mishna that prohibits slaughter with a fingernail is referring to slaughter <b>with an attached</b> fingernail, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi (15b), who invalidates slaughter performed with an item attached to the ground or a living animal.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>with a harvest sickle,</b> which is serrated with its teeth inclined considerably in one direction, <b>in a forward direction,</b> where the serrations do not tear the flesh, <b>Beit Shammai deem</b> the slaughter <b>not valid and Beit Hillel deem</b> it <b>valid. And</b> they both agree that <b>if they smoothed its serrations</b> so that they do not tear the flesh, its halakhic status <b>is like</b> that of <b>a knife</b> and one may slaughter with it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even when Beit Hillel deemed</b> the slaughter <b>valid, they deemed</b> it <b>valid only to purify it from</b> the ritual impurity of <b>an unslaughtered carcass; but its consumption is prohibited. Rav Ashi said:</b> The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches: Beit Shammai deem</b> the slaughter <b>not valid and Beit Hillel deem</b> it <b>valid, and he does not teach: Beit Shammai prohibit and Beit Hillel permit</b> its consumption. The Gemara objects: <b>But according to your reasoning, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach: Beit Shammai deem</b> the carcass <b>ritually impure and Beit Hillel deem</b> it <b>ritually pure. Rather,</b> the terms <b>deem</b> it <b>not valid and deem</b> it <b>valid and</b> the terms <b>prohibit and permit are</b> all <b>one matter,</b> and no inferences may be drawn from that phrasing.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>from within the</b> cricoid cartilage that forms a complete <b>ring</b> at the top of the windpipe <b>and left a thread breadth over the surface of</b> the ring in <b>its entirety</b> intact, as the knife did not go beyond the ring toward the head of the animal, <b>his slaughter is valid. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b> It is valid even if he left <b>a thread breadth over the majority of the surface of</b> the ring.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is <b>Rav and Shmuel who both say:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. And even Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says</b> his statement <b>only with regard to the large</b> upper <b>ring, since it encircles the entire windpipe, but with regard to the rest of the rings,</b> which are incomplete and where a strip of flesh connects their edges, he did <b>not</b> state his <i>halakha</i>. Therefore, his slaughter is not valid, as he is required to slaughter in the space between those rings and not in the rings themselves.
The Gemara objects: <b>And with regard to the rest of the rings,</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, did <b>not</b> state his <i>halakha</i>; <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says:</b>

Daf 18b

With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> from <b>within the rest of the rings, even though they do not encircle the entire windpipe, since they encircle the majority of the windpipe his slaughter is valid.</b> The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And</b> in a case where the knife <b>is diverted</b> from the place of slaughter above the ring, the slaughter is <b>not valid. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus testified about</b> a case where the knife <b>is diverted</b> from the area of slaughter above the ring <b>that</b> in such a case the slaughter is <b>valid.</b> Contrary to that which Rav and Shmuel said with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, he holds that slaughter from within the other rings is valid.
<b>Rav Yosef said: Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda is saying two</b> statements; <b>Rav and Shmuel hold in accordance with his</b> opinion <b>with regard to one</b> matter, that if one cuts a majority of the windpipe within the large ring the slaughter is valid, <b>and disagree with him with regard to one</b> matter, as in their opinion if one cuts the windpipe within the other rings, the slaughter is not valid.
The Gemara objects: <b>But didn’t</b> Rav and Shmuel <b>say:</b> And even Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>said</b> his statement <b>only</b> with regard to the large upper ring and not with regard to the other rings, indicating that in their opinion, this is the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda? The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what Rav and Shmuel are <b>saying:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>with regard to</b> cutting the majority of the windpipe within <b>the large ring, and</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with his</b> opinion <b>with regard to</b> the <b>other rings</b> that since they encircle a majority of the windpipe, one may slaughter within them as well.
<b>When Rabbi Zeira ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he ate</b> meat from an animal during whose slaughter the knife was <b>diverted</b> from the place of slaughter, with regard to <b>which Rav and Shmuel</b> ruled that the slaughter is not valid, and in Eretz Yisrael the ruling was that the slaughter is valid. The Torah scholars in Eretz Yisrael <b>said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: <b>Aren’t you from</b> Babylonia, <b>the place where Rav and Shmuel</b> are the halakhic authorities? You should follow their ruling. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to them: Who said</b> this <i>halakha</i> citing Rav and Shmuel? It was <b>Yosef bar Ḥiyya,</b> referring to Rav Yosef. <b>Yosef bar Ḥiyya learns from everyone,</b> even from students of Rav and Shmuel who misquote their statements.
<b>Rav Yosef heard</b> the comment of Rabbi Zeira and <b>was angry. He said:</b> Do <b>I learn from everyone? I learn from Rav Yehuda,</b> who is so meticulous in citing the statements of Rav and Shmuel <b>that he cites even uncertainties</b> with regard to attribution of statements <b>to the men</b> who said them. <b>As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says,</b> and it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it is <b>in the name of Rav</b> and <b>uncertain</b> whether it is <b>in the name of Shmuel:</b> A tribunal of <b>three permits</b> slaughter of a blemished <b>firstborn</b> animal outside of the Temple <b>in a place where there is no expert</b> Sage to consult.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Zeira not accept</b> the principle that when a person travels from place to place, the Sages <b>impose upon him the stringencies of the place from which he emerged and the stringencies of the place to which he went?</b>
<b>Abaye said: That statement</b> applies when one travels <b>from</b> one place in <b>Babylonia to</b> another place in <b>Babylonia, or from</b> one place in <b>Eretz Yisrael to</b> another place in <b>Eretz Yisrael,</b> or <b>alternatively,</b> when one descends <b>from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia. But</b> when one ascends <b>from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael,</b> this principle does not apply. <b>Since we,</b> the residents of Babylonia, <b>are subordinate to them</b> in terms of <i>halakha</i>, <b>we act in accordance with their</b> custom.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that when one travels <b>from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael,</b> he is required to act stringently in accordance with the custom of the place from which he emerged, <b>that statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where his intent is to return. Rabbi Zeira was not</b> one <b>whose intent was to return.</b> Therefore, he was not obligated to observe the Babylonian stringencies.
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: But didn’t the Sages who came from Meḥoza say</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira says in the name of Rav Naḥman:</b> In a case where the knife <b>is diverted</b> from the place of slaughter above the ring, the slaughter is <b>valid?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Each river and its</b> unique <b>course,</b> i.e., each place follows its custom, and in Meḥoza the custom was not in accordance with the opinion of Rav and Shmuel.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish deemed</b> the slaughter <b>valid</b> in a case where one cut the windpipe <b>at the tip of the thyroid cartilage</b> that is above the large ring. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan proclaimed about</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: He <b>greatly exaggerated</b> the limits of valid slaughter. <b>Rav Pappi said in the name of Rava:</b> If one cut the windpipe and <b>encountered the arytenoid cartilage</b> that is adjacent to the upper ring in the direction of the jaw and covered by the tip of the thyroid cartilage, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> i.e., forbidden. Since the arytenoid cartilage is outside the area of slaughter, the slaughter is invalid.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does encountered mean <b>encountered and touched it, as it is written: “And he encountered him and he died”</b> (I Kings 2:25); <b>or perhaps</b> it means <b>encountered but did not touch, like that which is written: “And the angels of God encountered him”</b> (Genesis 32:2)?
<b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rav Pappa said in the name of Rava:</b> If <b>one left</b> part <b>of the arytenoid cartilage,</b> i.e., if he cut it in the middle, the slaughter is <b>valid. Rav Ameimar bar Mar Yenuka said: I was standing before Rabbi Ḥiyya, son of Rav Avya, and he said to me:</b> If <b>one left</b> part <b>of the arytenoid cartilage,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid. Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Rav Shemen of Suvara said to me</b> that <b>Mar Zutra happened</b> to come <b>to our place and taught:</b> If <b>one left</b> part <b>of the arytenoid cartilage,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid. Mar bar Rav Ashi said:</b> If <b>one encountered the arytenoid cartilage,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid.</b> If <b>one left</b> part <b>of the arytenoid cartilage,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>

Daf 19a

The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: If one slaughters <b>from the incline of the thyroid cartilage and below</b> in the direction of the windpipe, the slaughter is <b>valid, and that is in</b> accordance with the opinion <b>that one who left</b> part <b>of the arytenoid cartilage</b> has still performed a valid slaughter, as the arytenoids cartilage extends beyond this point.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Naḥman deemed</b> the slaughter <b>valid</b> in a case where one slaughtered <b>from the incline of the thyroid cartilage and below. Rav Ḥanan bar Rav Ketina said to Rav Naḥman: In accordance with whose</b> opinion is that ruling? It is <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis nor in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who both hold that if one cuts the windpipe above the large upper ring, the cricoid cartilage, the slaughter is not valid.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Neither do I know Ḥillek nor do I know Billek,</b> i.e., I know the reason neither for this one’s opinion nor for that one’s opinion. <b>I know the <i>halakha</i>, as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Abba bar Zavda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: From the incline of the thyroid cartilage and below,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to analyzing the <i>baraita</i> (18b): In a case where the knife is diverted from the place of slaughter above the ring, the slaughter is not valid. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus testified about a case where the knife is diverted from the place of slaughter above the ring that the slaughter is valid. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> With regard to a case where the knife was <b>diverted</b> according to the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> cited in the mishna, the slaughter is <b>valid</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who ruled that the slaughter is valid when the majority of the windpipe was cut within the large, upper ring.
<b>And</b> with regard to a case where the knife was <b>diverted</b> according to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> it is <b>valid</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus,</b> who ruled that even if a majority of the windpipe was cut outside the large upper ring, the slaughter is valid.
The Gemara objects: That is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that the statement of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus,</b> who ruled that in a case where the knife is diverted from the place of slaughter above the ring it is valid, <b>addresses</b> the statement <b>of the Rabbis</b> and he agrees with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, that the slaughter is not valid when the majority of the windpipe was cut above the large upper ring, therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.
The Gemara objects: <b>And say it is indeed so</b> that Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus agrees with Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. The Gemara responds: <b>If so,</b> the formulation of the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> been: Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus <b>testified about it.</b> Since the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus was introduced merely with the term: Testified, apparently he disagrees with all of the other opinions. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus, as Rav Naḥman holds in accordance with his</b> opinion.
§ The mishna cited a dispute between the Rabbis, who hold that in a case where one slaughtered within the large upper ring and did not leave a thread breadth over the entire surface of the ring, the slaughter is not valid, and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, who hold that even if one left a thread breadth over a majority of the surface of the ring, the slaughter is valid. Apropos to that, <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Asi says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> is only <b>in</b> a case <b>where one cut two-thirds</b> of the windpipe within the ring <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> the knife upward toward the head of the animal and cut the remaining <b>one-third, as the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>we require the entire slaughter</b> to be performed <b>within the large ring, and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds:</b> The halakhic status of <b>its majority is like</b> that of <b>its entirety.</b>
<b>But</b> if <b>one diverted</b> the knife upward toward the head of the animal, cut <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe, <b>and</b> then <b>cut two-thirds</b> within the ring, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the slaughter is <b>not valid, as when the life left</b> the animal, i.e., when the majority of the windpipe was cut, <b>we require</b> that the entire <b>majority</b> be cut <b>by means of slaughter, and that is not</b> so in this case.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>On the contrary, let the Master say the opposite.</b> The <b>dispute</b> is only <b>in</b> a case <b>when one diverted</b> the knife upward toward the head of the animal, cut <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe, <b>and</b> then <b>cut two-thirds</b> within the ring, <b>as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds</b> that the slaughter is valid <b>just as it is</b> in the case <b>where half the windpipe is deficient.</b> In that case, once the slaughterer cuts any additional part of the windpipe, the slaughter is valid because the cut that rendered a majority of the windpipe slaughtered was performed properly. So too in this case, since the cut of the second third was performed properly, the slaughter is valid.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> hold that <b>there,</b> in the case of the deficient windpipe, the deficiency was in <b>the place of</b> proper <b>slaughter,</b> and therefore most of the life of the animal left in the proper place. <b>Here,</b> the first third was cut while the knife was diverted, and therefore most of the life of the animal did <b>not</b> leave in <b>the place of</b> proper <b>slaughter.</b>
<b>But</b> in a case where <b>one cut two-thirds</b> of the windpipe within the ring <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> the knife and cut the remaining <b>one-third, everyone agrees</b> that the slaughter is <b>valid, as didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (27a): The halakhic status of the slaughter of the <b>majority of one</b> <i>siman</i>, the windpipe or the gullet, <b>is like</b> that of the slaughter of the entire <i>siman</i> <b>itself?</b>
<b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>Who will say to us that</b> with regard to the mishna <b>there</b> concerning <b>the majority of</b> one <i>siman</i>, <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, did not teach it? Perhaps Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, taught it,</b> and the Rabbis disagree.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Is that to say</b> that with regard to <b>all</b> principles that address <b>majorities in general, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, taught them?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: I am speaking of the</b> principle of <b>majority with regard to slaughter, as we heard that</b> the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> with him.
<b>Some say</b> that there is <b>an alternative version</b> of this discussion: <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav Asi says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> is only in a case <b>where one diverted</b> the knife upward toward the head of the animal, cut <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe, <b>and</b> then <b>cut two-thirds</b> within the ring, <b>as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds</b> that the slaughter is valid <b>just as it is</b> in the case <b>where half the windpipe is deficient, and the Rabbis</b> hold that <b>there,</b> in the case of the deficient windpipe, the deficiency was in <b>the place of</b> proper <b>slaughter,</b> but <b>here,</b> most of the life of the animal did <b>not</b> leave in <b>the place of</b> proper <b>slaughter.</b>
<b>But</b> in a case where <b>one cut two-thirds</b> of the windpipe within the ring <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> the knife and cut the remaining <b>one-third, everyone agrees</b> that the slaughter is <b>valid, as didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (27a): The halakhic status of the slaughter of the <b>majority of one</b> <i>siman</i>, the windpipe or the gullet, <b>is like</b> that of the slaughter of the entire <i>siman</i> <b>itself?</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda objects to this: Who will say to us that</b> with regard to the mishna <b>there</b> concerning <b>the majority of</b> one <i>siman</i>, <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, did not teach it? Perhaps Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, taught it,</b> and the Rabbis disagree. <b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>Is that to say</b> that with regard to <b>all</b> principles that address <b>majorities in general, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, taught them?</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: I am speaking of the</b> principle of <b>majority with regard to slaughter, as we heard that</b> the Rabbis <b>disagree</b> with him.
§ If <b>one diverted</b> the knife and cut <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe, <b>and</b> then <b>cut one-third</b> properly, <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> and cut the final <b>one-third, Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b> The slaughter is <b>valid. Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b> The animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> i.e., forbidden. <b>Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b> The slaughter is <b>valid,</b> as <b>when the life left</b> the animal, it was <b>in</b> the course of a valid <b>slaughter</b> that <b>it left. Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b> The animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, as we require a majority</b> of the windpipe to be cut <b>with</b> valid <b>slaughter,and</b> that <b>is not</b> the case.
If <b>one cut one-third</b> of the windpipe properly, <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> the knife and cut <b>one-third, and</b> then <b>cut</b> the final <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe properly, <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Rav said:</b> The slaughter is <b>valid.</b> When the Sages <b>came and asked Rav Huna, he said to them:</b> It is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Rav Yehuda heard</b> the ruling of Rav Huna, and <b>he was angry. He said: I deem</b> it <b>a <i>tereifa</i> and he deems</b> the slaughter <b>valid, and I deem</b> the slaughter <b>valid</b> and <b>he deems</b> it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Rav Huna said:</b> It is <b>proper</b> that <b>he was angry. One</b> reason is that <b>he heard</b> it <b>from Rav and I did not hear</b> it from Rav; <b>and furthermore, isn’t there the majority</b> of the <i>siman</i> that was cut <b>with</b> valid <b>slaughter?</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>Do not retract</b> your statement,

Daf 19b

<b>as, if</b> you retract your statement, <b>you repudiate the first</b> ruling that you stated with regard to a case where one diverted the knife and cut one-third of the windpipe, and then cut one-third properly, and then diverted and cut the final one-third. <b>There, what is the reason</b> that <b>you deemed</b> the slaughter <b>valid?</b> The reason is <b>that when life left</b> the animal with the cutting of the second third of the windpipe, <b>it left</b> the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>valid</b> slaughter. Based on that reasoning, <b>here too, when life left</b> the animal with the cutting of the second third of the windpipe, <b>it left</b> the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>diverting</b> the knife, and the slaughter is invalid.
<b>Rav Naḥman happened</b> to come <b>to Sura,</b> where <b>they asked him:</b> If <b>one cut one-third</b> of the windpipe properly, <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> the knife and cut <b>one-third, and</b> then <b>cut</b> the final <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe properly, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>He said to them: Isn’t that</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated by <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Minyumi, as Rabbi Elazar bar Minyumi says: Slaughter that is performed like</b> the teeth of <b>a comb,</b> which are jagged, is <b>valid.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>And perhaps</b> Rabbi Elazar bar Minyumi stated his <i>halakha</i> only when the slaughter goes up and down <b>within</b> the proper <b>place of slaughter.</b> The Gemara asks in response: <b>Within</b> the proper <b>place of slaughter, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> it? Clearly the slaughter is valid in that case. The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we require slaughter</b> that is <b>clear</b> and straight, <b>and</b> slaughter that is jagged <b>is not</b> straight, therefore, Rabbi Elazar bar Minyumi <b>teaches us</b> that nevertheless, the slaughter is valid.
The Gemara cites <b>a mnemonic</b> for the order of the Sages in the following discussion: <b><i>Beit</i></b> for Rabbi Abba; <b><i>kaf</i></b> for Rav Kahana; <b><i>dalet</i></b> for Rav Yehuda.
<b>Rabbi Abba sat behind Rav Kahana and Rav Kahana sat before Rav Yehuda, and he sat and said</b> to Rav Yehuda: If <b>one cut one-third</b> of the windpipe properly, <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> the knife and cut <b>one-third, and</b> then <b>cut</b> the final <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe properly, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>His slaughter is valid.</b>
Rav Kahana then asked: If <b>one diverted</b> the knife and cut <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe, <b>and</b> then <b>cut one-third</b> properly, <b>and</b> then <b>diverted</b> and cut the final <b>one-third, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> him: <b>His slaughter is not valid.</b>
Rav Kahana then asked: If <b>one cut in a place</b> where there was <b>a perforation</b> in the front of the windpipe and continued cutting, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> him: <b>His slaughter is valid.</b>
Rav Kahana further asked: If <b>one cut</b> the windpipe <b>and</b> after cutting half the windpipe <b>encountered a perforation,</b> after which point a majority of the windpipe had been cut, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> him: <b>His slaughter is not valid.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abba went</b> to Eretz Yisrael and <b>stated</b> these <i>halakhot</i> <b>in the presence of Rabbi Elazar,</b> and <b>Rabbi Elazar went</b> and <b>stated</b> these <i>halakhot</i> <b>in the presence of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: What is different</b> about a case where one cut in a place where there was a perforation relative to a case where he encountered a perforation in the middle of the slaughter?
Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him:</b> In a case where <b>one cut in a place</b> where there was <b>a perforation, it becomes like</b> an animal <b>that a gentile</b> began to <b>slaughter and a Jew completed</b> its slaughter, in which case the slaughter is valid. In a case where <b>one cut</b> the windpipe <b>and encountered a perforation, it becomes like</b> an animal <b>that a Jew</b> began to <b>slaughter and a gentile completed</b> its slaughter, in which case the slaughter is not valid. Rabbi Yoḥanan mockingly <b>proclaimed about him: Gentile, gentile,</b> i.e., you merely repeat something about gentiles. Rabbi Yoḥanan did not accept the distinction.
<b>Rava said:</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan did <b>well</b> when he <b>proclaimed about him: Gentile, gentile. Granted, there,</b> in the case where the gentile completed the slaughter, <b>since a Jew was</b> supposed <b>to cut a majority</b> of the windpipe <b>and he did not cut</b> it, <b>when life left</b> the animal <b>it left by the hand of a gentile. But here, after all, he</b> was the one who <b>slaughtered</b> the entire animal, and the animal was not a <i>tereifa</i> until this point, and so <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if one began to cut <b>in a place</b> where there was <b>a perforation</b> and <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if he <b>encountered a perforation?</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who slaughters from the sides</b> of the throat, <b>his slaughter is valid. One who pinches</b> the neck of a bird offering <b>from the sides, his pinching is not valid.One who slaughters from the nape [<i>oref</i>]</b> of the neck, <b>his slaughter is not valid. One who pinches</b> a bird offering <b>from the nape</b> of the neck, <b>his pinching is valid. One who slaughters from the throat, his slaughter is valid. One who pinches</b> a bird offering <b>from the throat, his pinching is not valid, as the entire nape is valid for pinching and the entire throat is valid for slaughter. It is found that</b> that which is <b>valid for slaughter</b> is <b>not valid for pinching</b> and that which is <b>valid for pinching</b> is <b>not valid for slaughter.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the statement in the mishna: One who slaughters an animal from the <i>oref</i>, its slaughter is not valid, the Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>oref</i>? If we say</b> that the reference is to the <b>actual occipital bone</b> at the rear of the skull, <b>why</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply <b>specifically</b> to one who <b>slaughters</b> from the <i>oref</i>? <b>Even</b> if one <b>pinches</b> a bird offering from the <i>oref</i> it would <b>also</b> not be valid, as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “Pinch off its head <b>adjacent to its <i>oref</i>”</b> (Leviticus 5:8), at the nape beneath the occipital bone, <b>and not its <i>oref</i>. Rather, what</b> is the <b><i>oref</i></b> mentioned in the mishna? It is <b>adjacent to the <i>oref</i>,</b> the back of the neck below the occipital bone, <b>as it is taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>The entire nape is valid for pinching.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? They are derived <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the phrase <b>“adjacent to [<i>mimmul</i>] its <i>oref</i>,” adjacent</b> means a place <b>that sees the <i>oref</i></b>  and not the <i>oref</i> itself. <b>And likewise,</b> the verse <b>states: “And they reside adjacent to me [<i>mimmuli</i>]”</b> (Numbers 22:5); <b>and</b> the verse <b>states: “For they have turned their <i>oref</i> unto Me, and not their face”</b> (Jeremiah 2:27). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is added by the latter proof, introduced with the term: <b>And</b> the verse <b>states?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say, we do not know where the <i>oref</i> itself</b> is, so <b>that we will know where adjacent to it is, come</b> and <b>hear: “For they have turned their <i>oref</i> unto Me, and not their face,”</b> from which it may be ascertained <b>by inference that the <i>oref</i> is opposite the face,</b> at the rear of the head.
§ <b>The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya say:</b> How is <b>the mitzva of pinching</b> of a bird offering performed? <b>One moves</b> the two <b><i>simanim</i></b> that must be severed in ritual slaughter, i.e., the windpipe and the gullet, <b>behind the nape and pinches.</b> There is a dispute among the Sages with regard to the meaning of the statement. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say:</b> The mitzva <i>ab initio</i> is to pinch through the spinal column first and then pinch the windpipe and the gullet, and one may <b>even move</b> the <i>simanim</i> to behind the nape and pinch. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say:</b> The mitzva is <b>specifically</b> to <b>move</b> the <i>simanim</i> behind the nape and pinch.
The Gemara notes: <b>And it is reasonable according to the one who says: One may even move</b> the <i>simanim</i> behind the nape. <b>From where</b> does one draw that conclusion? It is <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches: One who slaughters from the nape</b> of the neck, <b>his slaughter is not valid. One who pinches from the nape</b> of the neck, <b>his pinching is valid.</b>

Daf 20a

<b>And if it enters your mind that</b> the mitzva is <b>specifically</b> to <b>move</b> the <i>simanim</i> behind the nape and pinch them, <b>why</b> did the <i>tanna</i> say <b>specifically</b> that if one <b>pinches</b> in this manner it is valid? <b>Even</b> if <b>one slaughters</b> from the nape in this manner the slaughter would be valid. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it</b> that the proper understanding is: One may <b>even move</b> the <i>simanim</i> behind the nape and pinch, <b>and the mishna is</b> referring to a case <b>where one did not move</b> the <i>simanim</i> behind the nape.
<b>Rabbi Yannai says: The young ones [<i>rovin</i>],</b> the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya, <b>shall receive their response</b> that rejects their statement from <b>that</b> which <b>is taught</b> in the mishna: <b>It is found that</b> that which is <b>valid for slaughter</b> is <b>not valid for pinching and</b> that which is <b>valid for pinching</b> is <b>not valid for slaughter. What</b> does this statement serve <b>to exclude?</b> Does it <b>not</b> serve <b>to exclude</b> the case where <b>one moves the <i>simanim</i> behind the nape,</b> teaching <b>that</b> it is valid only for slaughter and <b>not</b> for pinching?
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: No,</b> perhaps it serves <b>to exclude</b> one who uses <b>a tooth or a fingernail</b> that is not detached, which are valid for pinching and not valid for slaughter. The Gemara objects: That could not be, as the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches explicitly</b> the case of <b>a tooth and a fingernail</b> in a mishna (15b), and there was no need to repeat it.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> The statement of the mishna: That which is valid for slaughter is not valid for pinching, serves <b>to exclude drawing back and forth.</b> One who pinches may not cut the <i>simanim</i> by drawing his fingernail back and forth. Rather, he must press and cut them in one motion. The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says: Drawing back and forth for pinching is not valid, but according to the one who says:</b> It is <b>valid, what is there to say?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya hold in accordance with the one who says: Drawing back and forth for pinching is not valid.</b>
<b>Rav Kahana says: The mitzva of pinching</b> is that <b>one cuts</b> with his fingernail from the nape <b>and continues downward, and that is its mitzva. Rabbi Avin thought to say: Cuts and continues downward, yes; draws back and forth, no. Rabbi Yirmeya said to him: All the more so that drawing back and forth for pinching is valid.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>That is its mitzva,</b> which indicates that it is specifically in that manner? The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that it means: <b>That too is its mitzva.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Any</b> place <b>that is valid for slaughter</b> on the throat <b>is correspondingly valid for pinching</b> on the nape. By inference, any place on the throat that <b>is not valid for slaughter is not valid for pinching.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does this statement serve <b>to exclude? If we say</b> that it serves <b>to exclude ripping</b> the <b><i>simanim</i></b> from their place before cutting them, which is invalid with regard to pinching just as with regard to slaughter, <b>but didn’t Rami bar Yeḥezkel teach:</b> There is <b>no</b> disqualification of <b>ripping</b> the <b><i>simanim</i> in</b> the case of <b>a bird?</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It serves <b>to exclude</b> pinching the occipital bone at the back of <b>its head;</b> just as it is not the place of slaughter, it is not the place of pinching. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that pinching at the back of <b>its head</b> is not valid? <b>The Merciful One states: “Adjacent to its nape,” and not at its head.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is <b>its head</b> that is not the place for pinching? It is <b>the incline of its head,</b> e.g., in a case <b>where one began at the incline of its head and diverted and continued until he reached below</b> to the place of the <i>simanim</i>, where he completed the pinching. Since he began the process in the incorrect location, it is invalid, similar to slaughter. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>that Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav Asi says, as Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says:</b> If <b>one diverted</b> the knife upward and cut <b>one-third</b> of the windpipe <b>and</b> then <b>cut two-thirds</b> within the ring, the slaughter is <b>not valid.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> With regard to <b>that which Rami bar Yeḥezkel teaches:</b> There is <b>no</b> disqualification for <b>ripping <i>simanim</i> in a bird, we say</b> it <b>only according to the one who says: There is no</b> source for the <b>slaughter of a bird in the Torah.</b>

Daf 20b

<b>But according to the one who says: There is</b> a source for the <b>slaughter of a bird in the Torah, there is</b> disqualification for <b>ripping</b> <i>simanim</i> in a bird as well.
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: On the contrary, the opposite is reasonable. According to the one who says: There is</b> a source for the <b>slaughter of a bird in the Torah,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter are not explicit and were transmitted to Moses orally, and <b>it can be said that this is what</b> God <b>taught him, that there is no</b> disqualification for <b>ripping</b> <i>simanim</i>. <b>And even according to the one who says</b> that the halakhic status of a bird is <b>like</b> that of <b>an animal,</b> as the <i>halakhot</i> of the slaughter of a bird are derived from the <i>halakhot</i> of the slaughter of an animal, perhaps God taught Moses that with regard <b>to the matter of ripping</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>it will not be like an animal.</b>
<b>But according to the one who says: There is no</b> source for the <b>slaughter of a bird in the Torah,</b> but <b>rather</b> it is <b>by rabbinic law, from where are</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the slaughter of a bird <b>learned?</b> They are learned <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the slaughter of <b>an animal;</b> consequently, <b>the entire matter</b> of the slaughter of a bird is <b>like</b> that of <b>an animal.</b>
<b>Ravina said: Ravin bar Kisi said to me:</b> With regard to <b>that which Rami bar Yeḥezkel teaches,</b> i.e., that <b>there is no</b> disqualification for <b>ripping <i>simanim</i> in a bird, we say</b> it <b>only with regard to pinching, but with regard to slaughter, there is</b> disqualification for <b>ripping</b> <i>simanim</i>. The Gemara objects: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yirmeya say</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Any</b> place <b>that is valid for slaughter</b> on the throat <b>is correspondingly valid for pinching on the nape, but</b> that which is <b>not valid</b> for slaughter is <b>not valid</b> for pinching. The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>disagrees</b> with this statement of Shmuel.
§ <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> If <b>the neck bone</b> of an animal or a bird <b>was broken and most of the</b> surrounding <b>flesh</b> was cut <b>with it,</b> the status of the animal or the bird is that of <b>an unslaughtered carcass.</b> It is dead and can no longer be rendered fit by slaughter.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>we learn</b> this in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 68a) as well: If <b>one pinched</b> a bird offering <b>with a knife</b> and not with his thumbnail, the bird <b>renders the garments</b> of one who swallows it <b>impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat,</b> which is the <i>halakha</i> in the case of an unslaughtered carcass of a kosher bird. <b>And if you would say</b> that if the neck bone of an animal or a bird was broken and most of the surrounding flesh was cut with it, the bird is not an unslaughtered carcass but <b>it is a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> then since with regard to a bird offering <b>its pinching is its slaughter, let</b> pinching with <b>a knife be effective to purify</b> the bird <b>from</b> the impurity of <b>an unslaughtered carcass,</b> as a <i>tereifa</i> does not transmit impurity when slaughtered properly. From the <i>halakha</i> that pinching with a knife does not render the bird pure it is evident that when its neck bone is broken the bird is rendered an unslaughtered carcass.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>There,</b> pinching with a knife is ineffective in rendering it pure not because the breaking of the neck bone renders the bird an unslaughtered carcass. Rather, it is <b>because it is not slaughter at all.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? Rav Huna says:</b> It is <b>because he conceals</b> the knife and performs an inverted slaughter, which invalidates the slaughter. <b>Rava says:</b> It is <b>because he presses</b> the knife.
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>the one who says: Because he conceals</b> the knife and performs an inverted slaughter, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>he does not say: Because he presses</b> the knife? The Gemara answers: It is because <b>he holds</b> that <b>drawing back and forth in pinching is valid.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And the one who says: Because he presses</b> the knife, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>he does not say: Because he conceals [<i>maḥlid</i>]</b> the knife? The Gemara answers that <b>he</b> could have <b>said to you: What are the circumstances of concealing</b> the knife? It is <b>like a rat [<i>ḥulda</i>] that resides in the foundations of houses that are concealed. Here,</b> when he begins cutting from the nape of the neck, <b>that</b> knife <b>is exposed.</b>
<b>Rava said: If</b> that which Ze’eiri said: If the neck bone of an animal or a bird was broken and most of the surrounding flesh was cut with it, the status of the animal or the bird is that of an unslaughtered carcass, is <b>difficult for me, this</b> is <b>difficult for me:</b> How does pinching a bird offering prepare it for sacrifice? Since pinching involves breaking the neck bone and cutting most of the surrounding flesh with it before cutting the <i>simanim</i>, what significance is there to pinching the <i>simanim</i>? <b>And does he stand and pinch a dead</b> bird? If it is dead, of what use is the pinching?
<b>Abaye said to him: And</b> even without the statement of Ze’eiri, <b>let</b> the case of <b>a bird burnt offering be difficult for you, as</b> it <b>requires</b> cutting of <b>two <i>simanim</i>.</b> Since slaughter of a non-sacred bird requires cutting of one <i>siman</i>, once one <i>siman</i> is cut the bird is considered dead for all intents and purposes, <b>and does he stand and pinch a dead</b> bird? Rava <b>said to him: There,</b> he continues pinching <b>in order to fulfill through it the mitzva of separation</b> between the head and the body in the bird burnt offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> there should be an obligation to cut the <b>skin</b> of the bird <b>as well</b> in order to fulfill the mitzva of separation. Abaye answers: <b>Any</b> element <b>that invalidates slaughter invalidates separation, and any</b> element <b>that does not invalidate slaughter does not invalidate separation.</b> Failure to cut the skin does not invalidate slaughter.
The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t</b> there <b>the minority of the <i>simanim</i> according to the Rabbis, which do not invalidate slaughter,</b> as, if one slaughtered a majority of the <i>simanim</i> and a minority remained uncut, the slaughter is valid, <b>and</b> they hold that <b>they invalidate separation?</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rather, say: Any</b> element <b>that is</b> in effect <b>with regard to slaughter is</b> in effect <b>with regard to separation, and any</b> element <b>that is not</b> in effect <b>with regard to slaughter is not</b> in effect <b>with regard to separation.</b> The two <i>simanim</i>, although they do not invalidate slaughter, are part of the mitzva of slaughter, while the skin is not part of the mitzva of slaughter.

Daf 21a

<b>In any case,</b> the statement of Ze’eiri remains <b>difficult.</b> What is the significance of pinching a dead bird? <b>Rava said: Say</b> in explanation: <b>And likewise he does</b> when he pinches, <b>he cuts</b> the spinal <b>column and</b> the <b>neck bone without a majority of</b> the surrounding <b>flesh</b> and then he pinches the <i>simanim</i>.
The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Zeira ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rabbi Ami sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i></b> that Ze’eiri said, and Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: And does one stand and pinch a dead</b> bird? Rabbi Ami <b>was astonished [<i>eshtomam</i>] for a moment</b> (see Daniel 4:16), and thought about it and <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ami: <b>Say</b> that <b>this is what he does: He cuts</b> the spinal <b>column and</b> the <b>neck bone without a majority of</b> the surrounding <b>flesh.</b>
<b>That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How does one pinch</b> the nape of <b>a bird sin offering? He cuts</b> the spinal <b>column and</b> the <b>neck bone without a majority of</b> the surrounding <b>flesh until he reaches the gullet or the windpipe.</b> Once <b>he has reached the gullet or the windpipe, he cuts one <i>siman</i> or its majority and a majority of</b> the surrounding <b>flesh with it; and in a burnt offering</b> he cuts <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>or the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> whose opinion is cited in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> you say it is <b>the Rabbis, don’t they say</b> that one must cut <b>specifically two</b> <i>simanim</i> and not their majority? <b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, doesn’t he say</b> that one must cut only <b>a majority of</b> the <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i> and no more, in which case why does the <i>baraita</i> specify two <i>simanim</i> or the majority of two <i>simanim</i>?
The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that when the <i>baraita</i> says <b>two,</b> it is according <b>to the Rabbis;</b> when it says <b>a majority of two,</b> it is according <b>to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Both this,</b> two, <b>and that,</b> a majority of two, are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, and what</b> is the meaning of <b>two?</b> It does not mean two <i>simanim</i> in their entirety; rather, it means that one must cut a significant majority of the <i>simanim</i> <b>that is similar to two</b> entire <i>simanim</i>.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If the <b>neck bone</b> of a person <b>was broken and a majority of</b> the surrounding <b>flesh with it</b> was cut, that person <b>imparts impurity in a tent,</b> i.e., if one is beneath the same roof with him he becomes impure, as his halakhic status is that of a corpse even though he is still twitching.
<b>And if you say that</b> the <b>incident</b> of the death <b>of Eli,</b> the High Priest, whose death is described: “And his neck bone broke, and he died” (I Samuel 4:18), <b>was</b> one where the <b>neck bone</b> broke <b>without the majority of</b> the surrounding <b>flesh</b> being cut, and nevertheless he died immediately, the Gemara responds: <b>Old age is different, as it is written: “And it came to pass, when he made mention of the Ark of God, that he fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an old man, and heavy;</b> and he had judged Israel forty years” (I Samuel 4:18).
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If <b>one ripped</b> a person <b>like</b> one cuts <b>a fish,</b> lengthwise, the halakhic status of the ripped person is that of a corpse even though he is still convulsing, and he <b>imparts impurity in a tent. Rabbi Shmuel bar Yitzḥak says: And</b> that is specifically if he was ripped <b>from his back.</b>
§ The Gemara resumes discussions of the <i>halakhot</i> of an animal. <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>one rendered</b> the animal like <b>a shard [<i>gistera</i>]</b> by cutting it in two widthwise, its halakhic status is that of <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> even though it is still convulsing. <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If <b>the thigh,</b> the hind leg of the animal, <b>was removed and its recess is obvious,</b> it is <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> and it imparts impurity even if it remains alive. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of its recess</b> being <b>obvious? Rava said:</b> It is <b>any</b> situation <b>where</b> the animal <b>is collapsed and</b> even so its hind leg <b>is visibly lacking.</b>
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Oholot</i> 1:6) with regard to creeping animals whose carcasses are ritually impure: <b>If their heads were removed, even if they are convulsing, they are impure like the tail of a lizard</b> that was severed <b>that convulses</b> even though it is not alive.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>Were removed? Reish Lakish said:</b> They were <b>actually removed. Rabbi Asi</b> said that <b>Rabbi Mani said:</b> It is <b>like the separation of</b> the head of <b>the bird burnt offering.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Asi:</b> Do you mean <b>like the separation of</b> the head of <b>the bird burnt offering</b> according <b>to the Rabbis,</b> who hold that in addition to the neck bone and the surrounding flesh, one also completely severs the <i>simanim</i>, <b>and</b> then <b>you</b> and Reish Lakish <b>do not disagree,</b> as it is just like breaking the neck of the animal, since nothing remains other than the skin? <b>Or perhaps</b> you mean <b>like the separation of</b> the head of <b>the bird burnt offering</b> according <b>to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who says that one cuts the majority of two <i>simanim</i>, <b>and you</b> and Reish Lakish <b>disagree,</b> as Reish Lakish holds that the animal imparts impurity only when it is completely beheaded.
Rabbi Asi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: I mean <b>like the separation of</b> the head of <b>the bird burnt offering</b> according <b>to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who says that one cuts the majority of two <i>simanim</i>, <b>and we disagree.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> They were <b>actually removed. Rabbi Asi</b> said that <b>Rabbi Mani said:</b> It is <b>like the separation of</b> the head of <b>the bird burnt offering</b> according <b>to Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that one suffices <b>with</b> cutting <b>a majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and what</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The dispute is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a sliding-scale offering, in which a poor person who cannot afford an animal sin offering brings two doves or two pigeons, one as a sin offering and one as a burnt offering, it is written: <b>“And he shall prepare the second as a burnt offering, according to the ordinance”</b> (Leviticus 5:10), which means <b>according to the ordinance of an animal sin offering</b> in whose stead the offering was brought.
<b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>according to the ordinance of an animal sin offering, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only according to the ordinance of a bird sin offering?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When it says</b> with regard to the bird burnt offering brought as a gift offering: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall bring it</b> to the altar” (Leviticus 1:15), meaning that it shall be sacrificed in a unique manner, <b>the verse distinguished between a bird sin offering and a bird burnt offering. And</b> if so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the term <b>“according to the ordinance”?</b> It means <b>according to the ordinance of an animal sin offering; just as an animal sin offering comes only</b>

<b>from non-sacred</b> animals and not from an animal purchased with second-tithe money, <b>and</b> it is sacrificed only <b>during the day, and with the right hand of</b> the priest, <b>so too, a bird burnt offering comes only from non-sacred</b> animals, <b>and</b> it is sacrificed only <b>during the day, and with the right hand of</b> the priest.
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>If</b> so, perhaps <b>just as there,</b> with regard to an animal sin offering, slaughter is valid <b>with</b> the cutting of <b>the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>, the windpipe and the gullet, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to a bird burnt offering, the pinching is valid <b>with</b> the cutting of <b>the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And pinched off</b> its head…<b>and burned</b> it on the altar” (Leviticus 1:15). This indicates that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>burning, the head</b> is burned <b>by itself and the body</b> is burned <b>by itself, so too</b> with regard to <b>pinching, the head</b> remains <b>by itself and the body</b> remains <b>by itself.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yishmael says: “According to the ordinance”</b> (Leviticus 5:10), which is written with regard to the sliding-scale bird sin offering, means <b>according to the ordinance of the bird sin offering</b> mentioned in the previous verse. <b>Just as a bird sin offering</b> is pinched <b>adjacent to its nape</b> (Leviticus 5:8), beneath the occipital bone, <b>so too a bird burnt offering</b> is pinched <b>adjacent to its nape,</b> beneath the occipital bone.
<b>If</b> so, perhaps <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the bird sin offering, <b>he pinches and does not separate</b> between the head and the body and leaves <b>one <i>siman</i></b> uncut, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the burnt offering, <b>he pinches and does not separate</b> between the head and the body and leaves <b>one <i>siman</i></b> uncut. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall bring it,”</b> meaning that a bird burnt offering shall be sacrificed in a unique manner, not like the sin offering.
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: “According to the ordinance”</b> means <b>according to the ordinance</b> that is written with regard to <b>a bird sin offering. Just as there,</b>

Daf 22a

after the pinching, the priest <b>holds [<i>oḥez</i>] the head and the body</b> of the bird <b>and sprinkles</b> the blood on the altar, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the bird burnt offering, <b>he holds the head and the body and sprinkles</b> the blood on the altar.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is he saying?</b> There is no requirement with regard to a bird sin offering that the priest hold both the head and the body while sprinkling the blood. The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what <b>he is saying: Just as there,</b> with regard to the bird sin offering, <b>when the head is attached [<i>aḥuz</i>] to the body,</b> the priest <b>sprinkles</b> the blood on the altar, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the bird burnt offering, <b>when the head is attached to the body,</b> the priest <b>sprinkles</b> the blood on the altar. This is what was cited above in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, that one cuts a majority of two <i>simanim</i> in a burnt offering and not the two <i>simanim</i> in their entirety.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> so, perhaps <b>just as there,</b> in the sin offering, the pinching is performed <b>with</b> the cutting of <b>one <i>siman</i>, so too here,</b> in the burnt offering, the pinching is performed <b>with</b> the cutting of <b>one <i>siman</i>.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “And</b> the priest <b>shall bring it,”</b> meaning that the burnt offering is sacrificed in a manner different from that of the sin offering, by cutting two <i>simanim</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the first <i>tanna</i>, once we derive</b> that both <i>simanim</i> of a bird burnt offering must be cut in their entirety <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And pinch off</b> its head…<b>and burn</b> it on the altar,” <b>why do I</b> need the phrase: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall bring it?”</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>If not</b> for the verse that states: <b>“And</b> the priest <b>shall bring it,” I would say: What</b> is the meaning of <b>“according to the ordinance”</b> that is stated with regard to the bird burnt offering? It means <b>according to the ordinance of the bird sin offering</b> mentioned in that same passage, in the sense that even in the burnt offering, the priest cuts only one <i>siman</i>.
<b>And if you would say</b> that one cannot suggest this interpretation <b>due to</b> the verse: <b>“And pinch</b> off its head…<b>and burn</b> it on the altar,” <b>I would say</b> that perhaps another <i>halakha</i> would be derived from that verse: <b>Just as burning</b> the offering is <b>atop the altar, so too pinching</b> is performed <b>atop the altar.</b>
<b>Now that the Merciful One writes: “And</b> the priest <b>shall bring it,”</b> indicating the distinction between the pinching of a bird burnt offering and the pinching of a bird sin offering, <b>derive this also from</b> the verse: “And pinch off its head…and burn it on the altar,” i.e., that the body and the head of a bird burnt offering must be completely separated.
§ The first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> derives from the analogy between the bird burnt offering and the animal sin offering that a bird burnt offering is brought only from non-sacred animals and not from an animal purchased with second-tithe money, that it is sacrificed only during the day, and that the priest sacrificing it must do so with his right hand. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>that an animal sin offering comes only from non-sacred</b> animals? <b>Rav Ḥisda said that the verse states: “And Aaron shall sacrifice the bull of the sin offering that is his”</b> (Leviticus 16:6, 11), from which it is derived: The animal must come <b>from his</b> cattle, <b>but not from communal</b> property, from his cattle, <b>but not from</b> second-<b>tithe</b> property.
The Gemara objects: The <i>halakha</i> that the bird burnt offering is sacrificed only <b>during the day is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“In the day that he commanded</b> the children of Israel to present their offerings” (Leviticus 7:38), not from the <i>halakha</i> of the animal sin offering. The Gemara explains: The requirement of sacrificing the bird burnt offering during the day is not derived from the <i>halakha</i> of the animal sin offering, and it was <b>cited</b> in that list incidentally, <b>for no reason [<i>kedi</i>].</b>
The Gemara objects: The <i>halakha</i> that the priest performs the service with <b>his right hand is derived from</b> the statement <b>of Rabba bar bar Ḥana, as Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Any place where</b> the terms <b>finger or priesthood</b> are <b>stated</b> with regard to offerings, the sacrificial rites of that offering <b>are</b> performed <b>only</b> with the <b>right</b> hand, and in the context of the bird burnt offering the term “priest” is employed. It is therefore unnecessary to derive this <i>halakha</i> from the analogy to the animal sin offering.
The Gemara responds: <b>And the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, the first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, who derived that the right hand is used from the analogy to the animal sin offering based on the term “according to the ordinance,” did not derive it from the statement of Rabba bar bar Ḥana because in his opinion, in order to derive that the right hand must be used, if the verse mentions only the <b>priesthood,</b> it <b>requires</b> mention of <b>finger</b> for the limitation to apply. If the verse mentions only the term <b>finger,</b> then it <b>does not require</b> a mention of the <b>priesthood</b> as well. With regard to the bird burnt offering, the priesthood is mentioned, but the word finger is not. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> must be derived from the animal sin offering.
It is taught in the <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Yishmael derived from the term “according to the ordinance” that is written with regard to the bird burnt offering that the pinching of the bird burnt offering is performed at the nape of the neck, as it is in a bird sin offering. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who derive other matters from that term, <b>from where do they derive</b> that pinching of the bird burnt offering is performed at the nape of the neck? The Gemara answers: <b>They derive pinching</b> that is written with regard to the burnt offering: “And pinch off its head” (Leviticus 1:15), <b>from pinching</b> that is written with regard to the sin offering: “And pinch off its head adjacent to its neck” (Leviticus 5:8).
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is written with regard to bird offerings: “He shall bring his offering of doves, or of young pigeons” (Leviticus 1:14). The age that is <b>fit</b> for sacrifice <b>in doves,</b> mature birds, is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice <b>in pigeons,</b> immature birds;the age that is <b>fit</b> for sacrifice <b>in pigeons</b> is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice <b>in doves.</b> At the intermediate stage of <b>the beginning of the yellowing</b> of its plumage (see 22b), a bird <b>is unfit</b> both <b>as this,</b> a pigeon, <b>and as that,</b> a dove, since it is no longer a fledgling but is not yet a mature bird.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> in explaining the mishna: <b>Doves,</b> when they are <b>older,</b> are <b>fit</b> for sacrifice; when they are <b>younger,</b> they are <b>unfit. Pigeons,</b> when they are <b>younger,</b> are <b>fit</b> for sacrifice; when they are <b>older,</b> they are <b>unfit. It is found</b> that that which is <b>fit</b> for sacrifice <b>in doves</b> is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice <b>in pigeons;</b> that which is <b>fit</b> for sacrifice <b>in pigeons</b> is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice <b>in doves.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And he shall bring his offering of doves, or of young pigeons” (Leviticus 1:14), that <b>doves</b> are <b>older and not younger. As</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>And couldn’t this</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference:</b>

Daf 22b

<b>If pigeons, which were not deemed fit when older, were deemed fit when younger,</b> as the term “young pigeons” indicates that they are young, then with regard to <b>doves, which were deemed fit when older, isn’t it logical that they were deemed fit when younger?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Doves,”</b> meaning <b>older and not younger.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Young pigeons</b> must be <b>younger and not older, as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>And couldn’t this</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference: If doves, which were not deemed fit when younger, were deemed fit when older,</b> then with regard to <b>pigeons, which were deemed fit when younger, isn’t it logical that they were deemed fit when older?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Young pigeons,”</b> meaning <b>younger and not older.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> of these matters? <b>Rava said:</b> It is derived from the fact that it is <b>not</b> found that <b>the verse</b> would <b>deviate</b> from the norm <b>and write: Of young doves, or of pigeons;</b> rather, the wording in the Torah is always “of doves” or “of young pigeons.” Evidently, doves must be older and pigeons must be younger.
The Gemara objects: <b>Say</b> instead that with regard to <b>pigeons, since the Merciful One writes: “Young,”</b> this means <b>younger</b> birds, <b>yes, older</b> birds, <b>no;</b> but with regard to <b>doves, if one wishes, let him bring older</b> birds, and <b>if he wishes, let him bring younger</b> birds. The Gemara responds: Since doves and pigeons are always juxtaposed to one another in the Torah, it is derived that the <i>halakha</i> of doves is <b>similar to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>pigeons: Just as</b> with regard to <b>pigeons</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>younger</b> birds, <b>yes, older</b> birds, <b>no, so too</b> with regard to <b>doves,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>older</b> birds, <b>yes, younger</b> birds, <b>no.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that all the</b> older <b>doves or all the</b> younger <b>pigeons would be fit</b> for sacrifice; therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of doves,” and not all doves; “of young pigeons,” and not all young pigeons.</b> This serves to <b>exclude</b> birds at <b>the beginning of the yellowing</b> of their neck plumage, <b>which are unfit as this,</b> doves, <b>and as that,</b> pigeons. They are unfit as doves because they are not sufficiently old and as pigeons because they are no longer young. The <i>tanna</i> elaborates: <b>From when are the doves fit?</b> It is <b>from when</b> the color of their feathers <b>turns a glistening gold. From when are the pigeons unfit?</b> It is <b>from when</b> their feathers <b>turn yellow.</b>
<b>Ya’akov Korḥa taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From when are pigeons fit?</b> It is <b>from when <i>ye’alu</i>. He teaches</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>and he states its</b> explanation: The reference is to that which is stated: <b>“Its fledglings will suck up [<i>ye’alu</i>] blood”</b> (Job 39:30). <b>When</b> is that? <b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>from</b> the stage <b>when one plucks a feather from it and blood emerges.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering of doves or of pigeons, and he brought</b> birds at <b>the beginning of the yellowing</b> of their neck plumage <b>of this,</b> doves, <b>and of that,</b> pigeons, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is</b> it a case of <b>uncertainty</b> whether it is considered older or younger, <b>and</b> therefore when he brings both <b>he fulfills</b> his obligation, as one of the birds was fit for sacrifice; <b>or perhaps</b> a bird at the beginning of the yellowing <b>is an entity</b> in and of itself and is neither older nor younger, <b>and he does not fulfill</b> his obligation?
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the <i>baraita</i> where it is taught that the verse: “Of doves or of young pigeons,” serves to <b>exclude</b> birds at <b>the beginning of the yellowing</b> of their neck plumage <b>that are unfit as this,</b> doves, <b>and as that,</b> pigeons. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that a bird at that stage <b>is an entity</b> in and of itself, that works out <b>well,</b> as the verse serves to ensure that a bird at that stage of development will never be sacrificed. <b>But if you say</b> that it <b>is</b> a case of <b>uncertainty, was</b> it <b>necessary</b> for <b>the verse to exclude</b> a case of <b>uncertainty?</b>

Daf 23a

The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>When</b> the phrase in <b>the verse</b> “of doves or of young pigeons” <b>was necessary,</b> it was <b>to exclude</b> a bird <b>that was the object of bestiality or</b> a bird that <b>was worshipped</b> as a deity.
As it could <b>enter your mind to say: Since it is written</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of disqualified offerings: <b>“Because their corruption [<i>moshḥatam</i>] is in them, there is a blemish in them”</b> (Leviticus 22:25), referring to two types of disqualifications: Corruption and blemish, <b>and the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Anywhere that</b> the term <b>corruption [<i>hashḥata</i>] is stated, it is</b> referring to <b>nothing other than a matter of licentiousness and idol worship.</b> The Gemara cites proofs for this claim: Corruption is referring to <b>matters of licentiousness, as it is written: “For all flesh had corrupted [<i>hishḥit</i>] their way upon the earth”</b> (Genesis 6:12); the word “way” alludes to sexual intercourse.
Corruption is also referring to <b>idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly [<i>tashḥitun</i>], and make you a graven image”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:16); one might have thought: <b>Any</b> type of offering <b>that a blemish disqualifies, matters of licentiousness and idol worship disqualify it, and any</b> type of offering <b>that a blemish does not disqualify, matters of licentiousness and idol worship do not disqualify it. And</b> with regard to <b>these birds, since blemishes do not disqualify them, as the Master says:</b> There is a requirement of <b>an unblemished state and male gender in</b> a sacrificial <b>animal and there is no</b> requirement of <b>an unblemished state and male gender in</b> sacrificial <b>birds, say</b> that <b>matters of licentiousness and idol worship</b> should <b>also not disqualify</b> the birds. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> from the phrase in the verse “of doves or of young pigeons” that a bird that was the object of bestiality and a bird that was worshipped as a deity are disqualified.
§ Apropos the discussion of the beginning of the yellowing of the neck plumage, the Gemara cites another matter where there is uncertainty as to whether an animal of a particular age is of uncertain status or an entity in and of itself. <b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>an animal burnt offering of a ram,</b> which is a sheep that is at least thirteen months old, <b>or of a lamb,</b> which is up to one year old, <b>and he brought a <i>palges</i>,</b> which is between one year and thirteen months old, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara elaborates: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, do not raise a dilemma, as he says</b> that a <i>palges</i> <b>is an entity in and of itself, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 1:3): If one was obligated to bring a ram or lamb as an offering, and he <b>sacrificed</b> a <i>palges</i>, <b>he brings with it</b> the meal offering and <b>the libations of a ram</b> offering, namely, a meal offering of two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mingled with four <i>log</i> of oil, and a libation of four <i>log</i> of wine, <b>but it does not fulfill his</b> obligation to bring <b>his offering.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the requirement to bring the meal offering and libations of a ram offering is derived from the verse in the portion of the libations: <b>“Or for a ram,</b> you shall prepare for a meal offering two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with one-third of a <i>hin</i> of oil” (Numbers 15:6); that serves <b>to include the <i>palges</i>,</b> whose meal offering and libations are like that of a ram. Based on that derivation, there is no uncertainty with regard to the status of the <i>palges</i>.
<b>When you raise a dilemma,</b> it is <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of bar Padda,</b> who holds that it is a case of uncertainty,

Daf 23b

<b>as he says</b> that one who sacrifices a <i>palges</i> <b>brings</b> the meal offering and the libation of a ram <b>and stipulates:</b> If it is a ram, this is its meal offering and libation, and if it is a lamb, whose meal offering and libation are less than that of the ram, then the remainder will be a gift offering.
The dilemma is: <b>Do we say</b> that he <b>stipulates</b> only if it is <b>a ram or</b> if it is <b>a lamb,</b> but <b>he does not stipulate</b> the possibility that it is <b>an entity</b> in and of itself, as bar Padda does not accept such a possibility? If so, bar Padda holds that one who vowed to bring a ram or a lamb can fulfill his obligation by bringing a <i>palges</i> and stipulating accordingly. <b>Or perhaps</b> bar Padda holds that <b>he also stipulates</b> the possibility that it is <b>an entity</b> in and of itself, and in <b>that</b> case <b>he says: If</b> it <b>is an entity, let the entire</b> libation <b>be a gift</b> offering. According to that possibility, even according to bar Padda, if one vowed to bring a ram or a lamb and brought a <i>palges</i>, due to the uncertainty he does not fulfill his obligation. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The concept of an entity in and of itself is mentioned with regard to a thanks offering, with which one must bring twenty tenths of an ephah for the accompanying loaves: Ten tenths of an ephah for <i>matza</i> and ten for leavened bread. <b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>loaves of a thanks offering of leavened bread or of <i>matza</i>, and he brought leavening</b> dough [<b><i>siur</i></b>], <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara asks: <b><i>Siur</i></b> according <b>to whose</b> opinion? <b>If</b> the reference is to the <b><i>siur</i> of Rabbi Meir,</b> who says that it is dough at the stage when its surface pales, according <b>to Rabbi Yehuda</b> it is not leavened bread at all; <b>it is full-fledged <i>matza</i></b> and one fulfills his vow to bring <i>matza</i>.
<b>If</b> the reference is to the <i>siur</i> <b>of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who says that it is dough at the stage when it has cracks that look like the antennae of locusts and is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> Rabbi Meir holds that <b>it is</b> full-fledged <b>leavened bread,</b> and one fulfills his vow to bring leavened bread.
<b>And if</b> the reference is to the <i>siur</i> <b>of Rabbi Meir</b> and is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> although one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for eating it on Passover, <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>that one is flogged for</b> eating <b>it</b> on Passover it <b>is</b> clearly <b>leavened bread,</b> with which one fulfills his vow to bring leavened bread.
<b>Rather,</b> the dilemma is with regard to the <i>siur</i> <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that although one is obligated to destroy it before Passover, one is not liable to receive lashes for eating it on Passover. It is unclear whether this is due to uncertainty or due to <i>siur</i> having a unique status. Therefore, Rabbi Zeira raises the dilemma: <b>What</b> is its status? <b>Is</b> it a case of <b>uncertainty, and</b> consequently one who vowed to bring loaves of <i>matza</i> or leavened bread and brings <i>siur</i> <b>fulfills</b> his obligation <b>whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, because if it is <i>matza</i>, he fulfills his vow to bring <i>matza</i>, and if it is leavened bread, he fulfills his vow to bring leavened bread? <b>Or perhaps</b> <i>siur</i> <b>is an entity</b> in and of itself, neither <i>matza</i> nor leavened bread, <b>and he does not fulfill</b> his obligation at all.
The Gemara asks: Even if it is a case of uncertainty, how can a person fulfill his vow with that <i>siur</i>? <b>But doesn’t Rav Huna say</b> that <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>loaves of a thanks offering,</b> is obligated to <b>bring a thanks offering and</b> all <b>its loaves,</b> twenty tenths of an ephah, ten for matza and ten for leavened bread? <b>And since he is obligated to</b> bring <b>a thanks offering and</b> all <b>its loaves, but this man does not know whether</b> the <i>siur</i> that he brought <b>is leavened bread so that he will bring <i>matza</i>,</b> or <b>whether</b> the <i>siur</i> that he brought <b>is <i>matza</i> so that he will bring leavened bread,</b> so how can he fulfill his vow? In any case, the only way that he could fulfill his vow would be to bring an additional twenty tenths of an ephah.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the dilemma of Rabbi Zeira is <b>necessary</b> only in a case <b>where one said: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring the <b>loaf</b> element of the thanks offering <b>to exempt the thanks offering of so-and-so</b> from the obligation to bring loaves, as in that case he can fulfill his vow because he did not obligate himself to bring a thanks offering.
The Gemara objects: <b>Ultimately, this man</b> who brings the thanks offering <b>does not know whether</b> the <i>siur</i> that the other contributed <b>is leavened bread so that he will bring <i>matza</i>,</b> or <b>whether</b> the <i>siur</i> that the other contributed <b>is <i>matza</i> so that he will bring leavened bread.</b> Therefore, the man bringing the thanks offering must bring both matza and unleavened bread in addition to the <i>siur</i>, and the one who vowed has then not exempted him from any obligation by contributing the <i>siur</i>. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the dilemma of Rabbi Zeira is <b>necessary</b> only in a case <b>where</b> he said: It is incumbent upon me to bring loaves of leavened bread or <i>matza</i> for the thanks offering of so-and-so, but <b>did not say: To exempt</b> his thanks offering. In that case, he is not obligated to fulfill the other’s obligation, and the dilemma is: <b>Does the man fulfill his vow</b> by bringing the loaves of <i>siur</i> <b>or does he not fulfill</b> his vow? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> That which is <b>fit in</b> a red <b>heifer</b> is <b>unfit in a heifer</b> whose neck is broken; that which is <b>fit in a heifer</b> whose neck is broken is <b>unfit in</b> a red <b>heifer.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in explanation of the mishna: With regard to the red <b>heifer, with slaughter</b> it is <b>fit; with breaking the neck</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> With regard to the <b>heifer</b> whose neck is broken, <b>with breaking the neck</b> it is <b>fit; with slaughter</b> it is <b>unfit. Consequently,</b> that which is <b>fit in</b> a red <b>heifer</b> is <b>unfit in a heifer</b> whose neck is broken; that which is <b>fit in a heifer</b> whose neck is broken is <b>unfit in</b> a red <b>heifer.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> it be derived that the red <b>heifer</b> is <b>fit with breaking the neck by means of an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If a heifer</b> whose neck is broken, <b>which is not rendered fit with slaughter, is rendered fit with breaking the neck,</b> then with regard to a red <b>heifer, which is rendered fit with slaughter, isn’t it logical that it is rendered fit with breaking the neck?</b>

Daf 24a

The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the red heifer: <b>“And he shall slaughter</b> it” (Numbers 19:3), <b>and</b> it mentions the term <b>statute:</b> “This is the statute of the Torah” (Numbers 19:2), indicating that <b>with slaughter, yes,</b> the red heifer is rendered fit; <b>with breaking the neck,</b> the red heifer is <b>not</b> rendered fit.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>anywhere that statute is written with regard to</b> a certain matter, <b>we do not learn an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference? <b>But</b> what <b>about Yom Kippur, with regard to which statute is written:</b> “And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you” (Leviticus 16:34), <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And Aaron shall bring forward the goat upon which the lot came up for the Lord, <b>and he shall offer it for a sin offering”</b> (Leviticus 16:9). The verse indicates that <b>the lottery renders</b> the goat <b>a sin offering, but a verbal designation</b> of the goat with the status of a sin offering <b>does not render</b> it <b>a sin offering.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: A verse is necessary to teach this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the opposite conclusion is correct: <b>Could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference: If in a case where the lottery does not sanctify</b> the animal with a specific designation, such as in the case of two birds brought by a woman after childbirth, and nevertheless <b>a verbal designation</b> of that offering <b>sanctifies</b> it, in <b>a case where the lottery sanctifies</b> the animal on Yom Kippur, <b>isn’t it logical that a verbal designation</b> as a sin offering <b>sanctifies it?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And render it a sin offering;” the lottery renders</b> the goat <b>a sin offering, but a verbal designation</b> of a sin offering <b>does not render</b> the goat <b>a sin offering.</b>
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that the <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not learned is <b>that the Merciful One writes: “And he shall offer it for a sin offering.” But otherwise we</b> would <b>learn an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, despite the fact that statute is written with regard to the Yom Kippur service.
The Gemara explains: Actually, one may learn an <i>a fortiori</i> inference even in a case where statute is written. Nevertheless, <b>with regard to</b> the <b>heifer</b> whose neck is broken, <b>the Merciful One restricts</b> the use of breaking the neck: “And all the Elders of that city…shall wash their hands over the heifer <b>whose neck is broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6). From the relative pronoun “whose” it is derived: <b>This</b> heifer <b>is</b> killed <b>by breaking the neck, but no other,</b> i.e., the red heifer, is killed <b>by breaking the neck.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>And let it be</b> derived that the heifer whose neck is broken is rendered <b>fit with slaughter by means of an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> a red <b>heifer, which is not rendered fit with breaking the neck,</b> is rendered <b>fit with slaughter,</b> then with regard to <b>a heifer</b> whose neck is broken, <b>which</b> is rendered <b>fit with breaking the neck, isn’t it logical that it is rendered fit with slaughter?</b> The Gemara responds that <b>the verse states: “And shall break the neck of the heifer</b> there in the valley” (Deuteronomy 21:4). The doubled reference to breaking the neck in the two verses indicates that <b>by breaking the neck, yes,</b> the heifer may be killed; <b>by slaughter,</b> the heifer may <b>not</b> be killed.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There is an element with which <b>priests</b> remain <b>fit</b> and <b>Levites are unfit,</b> and there is also an element with which <b>Levites</b> remain <b>fit</b> and <b>priests are unfit.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in explanation of the mishna: <b>Priests are</b> rendered <b>unfit</b> for Temple service <b>with</b> the <b>blemishes</b> enumerated in the Torah (see Leviticus 21:16–23), but remain <b>fit with</b> the passage of <b>years,</b> as from the moment that they reach majority they are fit for service for the rest of their lives. <b>Levites</b> remain <b>fit</b> for Temple service <b>with</b> the <b>blemishes</b> enumerated in the Torah but <b>are unfit with</b> the passage of <b>years,</b> as they are fit for service only between the ages of thirty and fifty (see Numbers 4:47). <b>It is found</b> that there is an element with which <b>priests</b> remain <b>fit</b> and <b>Levites are unfit,</b> and there is an element with which <b>Levites</b> remain <b>fit</b> and <b>priests are unfit.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“This is that which pertains to the Levites”</b> (Numbers 8:24); <b>why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>Since it is stated: “And from the age of fifty years he shall return</b> from the service” (Numbers 8:25), <b>we learned with regard to the Levites that</b> the passage of <b>years disqualifies them.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>blemishes disqualify them</b> too. <b>And</b> ostensibly, it could be learned through <b>logical inference: If priests,</b> with regard to <b>whom</b> the passage of <b>years does not disqualify them, blemishes disqualify them,</b> then in the case of <b>Levites,</b> with regard to <b>whom</b> the passage of <b>years disqualifies them, isn’t it logical that blemishes disqualify them?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This is that which pertains to the Levites,”</b> from which it is derived: <b>“This,”</b> the passage of years, is a disqualification that pertains <b>to the Levites, and there is no other</b> disqualification that pertains <b>to the Levites.</b>
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>priests would be disqualified with</b> the passage of <b>years. And</b> ostensibly, <b>could this not</b> be derived through the following <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference: If Levites,</b> with regard to <b>whom blemishes do not disqualify them,</b> the passage of <b>years disqualifies them,</b> then in the case of <b>priests,</b> with regard to <b>whom blemishes disqualify them, isn’t it logical</b> that the passage of <b>years disqualifies them?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Which pertains to the Levites,” and not which pertains to the priests.</b>
One <b>might</b> have thought that the Levites were disqualified with the passage of years <b>even in Shiloh,</b> the permanent place of the Tabernacle, <b>and in the eternal Temple.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “To perform the work of service, and the work of bearing burdens”</b> (Numbers 4:47), juxtaposing the two forms of Levite service to teach: <b>I stated</b> the disqualification of the passage of years <b>only at a time when</b> there is Levite <b>service</b> involving carrying the Tabernacle <b>on</b> their <b>shoulders.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> notes that <b>one verse states: “From twenty-five years old and upward”</b> (Numbers 8:24), <b>and one verse states: “From thirty years old</b> and upward” (Numbers 4:47). It is <b>impossible to say thirty, as twenty-five is already stated, and</b> it is <b>impossible to say twenty-five, as thirty is already stated. How</b> can these verses be reconciled? <b>Twenty-five</b> years old is the time <b>for apprenticeship and thirty for service.</b>
<b>From here</b> it is derived that <b>a student who did not see a positive indication in his studies</b> after <b>five years will no longer see</b> a productive result from those studies. <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that the period is <b>three years, as it is stated</b> with regard to Daniel and his cohort who instructed the king of Babylonia: <b>“And they should be raised three years”</b> (Daniel 1:5), <b>“and he should teach them the books and the language of the Chaldeans”</b> (Daniel 1:4).
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i> explain the verses in Daniel? The Gemara answers: He holds that the verses in Daniel cannot be cited as a source for this principle because <b>the language of the Chaldeans is different, as</b> it is <b>easy</b> and can be learned in a shorter period. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i>, Rabbi Yosei, explain the verses with regard to the Levites? The Gemara answers: He holds that <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of</b> Temple <b>service are different, as they are difficult</b> and require a longer period of study.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A priest, from</b> the time he reaches puberty and <b>grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs until he ages, is fit for</b> Temple <b>service, and blemishes disqualify him. A Levite from the age of thirty until the age of fifty is fit for</b> Temple <b>service, and</b> the passage of <b>years disqualifies him. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to the Tent of Meeting</b> of the Tabernacle <b>in the wilderness. But with regard to Shiloh and in the eternal Temple,</b> Levites <b>are disqualified only</b> due to a change <b>in voice</b> that renders them unable to recite the songs in the Temple with their brethren. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived?

Daf 24b

<b>“It came to pass, when the trumpeters and singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard”</b> (II Chronicles 5:13). This indicates that the Levites must be capable of singing in one voice, and one who is unable to do so is unfit for service.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the priest is eligible for service <b>until he ages.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Until when,</b> i.e., what is the definition of aging in this context? <b>Rabbi Ela says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Until</b> his hands and feet begin to <b>tremble.</b>
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Mikvaot</i> 8:4): With regard to <b>one who experienced a seminal emission who</b> then <b>immersed</b> in a ritual bath <b>and did not urinate</b> before immersing, <b>when he urinates he is ritually impure,</b> because residue of the semen remain in his body and was discharged with the urine, rendering him impure. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: In</b> the case of <b>an ill</b> person <b>and an elderly</b> person, he is <b>ritually impure; in</b> the case of <b>a young</b> person <b>and a healthy</b> person, he is <b>ritually pure,</b> as the semen was presumably discharged in its entirety at the outset.
<b>Until when</b> is one considered <b>a young</b> person? <b>Rabbi Ela says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Anyone who</b> is able to <b>stand on one of his legs and remove his shoe or put on his shoe</b> is considered young. <b>They said about Rabbi Ḥanina that he was eighty years old and would stand on one of his legs and remove his shoe or put on his shoe. Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The <b>hot water and oil that my mother smeared on me in my youth benefited me in my old age.</b>
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>one’s beard</b> is <b>fully</b> grown, <b>he is fit to be appointed an emissary of the community</b> for various matters, <b>and to descend before the ark</b> as a prayer leader, <b>and to lift his hands</b> for the Priestly Benediction. <b>From when</b> is a priest <b>fit for</b> Temple <b>service?</b> It is <b>from</b> the time he reaches puberty and <b>grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that he is not fit for Temple service <b>until he is twenty</b> years of <b>age.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? The reason is <b>as it is written: “And appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to oversee of the work of the House of the Lord”</b> (Ezra 3:8). <b>And</b> what does <b>the other</b> <i>tanna</i> hold? He holds that <b>to oversee is different</b> and requires an older priest.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what proof can be cited from this verse with regard to priests; <b>isn’t that verse written with regard to Levites?</b> The Gemara answers: It is understood <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: In twenty-four places</b> in the Bible the <b>priests are called Levites. And this is one of those</b> verses: <b>“And the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok”</b> (Ezekiel 44:15). The verse in Ezra is another one of the verses.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“Any man of your descendants throughout their generations</b> that has a blemish shall not approach to offer the bread of his God” (Leviticus 21:17); <b>from here Rabbi Elazar says: A minor</b> priest is <b>unfit for</b> Temple <b>service, even</b> if he is <b>unblemished,</b> as he is not a man. <b>From when</b> is <b>he fit for service? From</b> the time he reaches puberty and <b>grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs. But his brethren the priests do not allow him to perform the service until he is twenty</b> years of <b>age.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say: This is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and he is</b> of the opinion that there is <b>no disqualification</b> for one between puberty and twenty years of age <b>even by rabbinic law.</b> The other priests simply do not allow priests of that age to perform the Temple service <i>ab initio</i>. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is of</b> the opinion that there is <b>disqualification by rabbinic law</b> in that case, <b>and this</b> statement in the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and</b> they hold that <b>it is <i>ab initio</i> that</b> one may <b>not</b> perform the service, <b>but after the fact, his service is valid.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> That which is <b>ritually pure in an earthenware vessel</b> is <b>ritually impure in all the</b> other types of <b>vessels;</b> that which is <b>ritually pure in all the</b> other types of <b>vessels</b> is <b>ritually impure in an earthenware vessel.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> explaining the mishna: If a primary source of ritual impurity fell into the <b>airspace of an earthenware vessel</b> the vessel is <b>ritually impure, and</b> if it fell on <b>its outer side,</b> the vessel is <b>ritually pure.</b> If a primary source of ritual impurity fell into the <b>airspace of all the</b> other types of <b>vessels,</b> the vessels are <b>ritually pure, and</b> if it fell on <b>their outer side,</b> they are <b>ritually impure. It is found</b> that that which is <b>ritually pure in an earthenware vessel</b> is <b>ritually impure in all the</b> other <b>vessels,</b> and that which is <b>ritually pure in all the</b> other <b>vessels</b> is <b>ritually impure in an earthenware vessel.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> based on the verse: “And every earthenware vessel into which [<i>tokho</i>] any of them falls, whatever is in it [<i>tokho</i>] shall be impure, and it you shall break” (Leviticus 11:33); if an impure item fell <b>“in it [<i>tokho</i>],” and even</b> in a case <b>where</b> the impure item <b>did not come into contact</b> with the vessel, the vessel becomes impure.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that it is impure <b>even if</b> the impure item <b>did not come into contact</b> with the vessel, <b>or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> impure <b>only if it did come into contact</b> with the vessel? <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Avtolemos says: <i>Tokho</i> is stated</b> with regard <b>to transmitting impurity</b> to food in its airspace, as it is stated: “Whatever is in it [<i>tokho</i>] shall be impure,” <b>and <i>tokho</i> is stated</b> with regard <b>to becoming impure,</b> as it is stated: “Into which [<i>tokho</i>] any of them falls”; <b>just as</b> in the case of <b><i>tokho</i> that is stated</b> with regard <b>to transmitting impurity</b> to food in its airspace, the food is impure <b>even if</b> the impure item <b>did not come into contact</b> with the vessel, <b>so too,</b> in the case of <b><i>tokho</i> that is stated</b> with regard <b>to</b> the vessel <b>becoming impure,</b> the vessel is impure <b>even if</b> the impure item <b>did not come into contact</b> with it.
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to rendering food impure in its airspace, <b>from where do we</b> derive that the food becomes impure even if it did not come into contact with the impure vessel? <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: The Torah testified about an earthenware vessel</b>

Daf 25a

that it renders impure everything within it, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if it is <b>full of mustard</b> seeds, in which case most of the seeds do not come in contact with the sides of the vessel, and nevertheless all the mustard seeds become impure.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said to Rava: And let</b> it be derived that <b>an earthenware vessel becomes impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>its outer side by means of an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If all the</b> other types of <b>vessels, which do not become impure from</b> the presence of an impure item in <b>their airspace, become impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>their outer side,</b> then with regard to <b>an earthenware vessel, which becomes impure from</b> the presence of an impure item in <b>its airspace, isn’t it logical that it will become ritually impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>its outer side?</b>
The Gemara answers: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And every open vessel that has no sealed cover upon it</b> is impure” (Numbers 19:15), indicating that its impurity is dependent upon the mouth of the vessel. <b>Which is the vessel whose impurity hastily</b> takes effect just after the impure item enters <b>into its mouth? You must say</b> that is <b>an earthenware vessel. And</b> it is <b>when there is no sealed cover on it that</b> the vessel becomes <b>impure. But</b> when <b>there is a sealed cover on it,</b> the vessel is <b>pure,</b> as the earthenware vessel does not become impure from contact of an impure item with its outer side.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> it be derived that <b>all the</b> other <b>vessels become impure from</b> the presence of an impure item in <b>their airspace by means of an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If an earthenware vessel, which does not become impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>its outer side, becomes impure from</b> the presence of an impure item in <b>its airspace,</b> then with regard to <b>all the</b> other <b>vessels, which become impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>their outer side, isn’t it logical that they will become ritually impure from</b> the presence of an impure item in <b>their airspace?</b>
The Gemara answers: Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the carcasses of creeping animals: “And every earthenware vessel <b>into which [<i>tokho</i>]</b> any of them falls” (Leviticus 11:33), from which it is inferred: <b><i>Tokho</i>,</b> i.e., the airspace, <b>of this</b> earthenware vessel renders the vessel impure, <b>and not <i>tokho</i>,</b> the airspace, <b>of</b> any <b>other</b> kind of vessel.
The Gemara objects: How can the <i>halakha</i> be derived from the term <i>tokho</i> in that verse? <b>But didn’t</b> the Sages <b>interpret these</b> instances of <b><i>tokho</i></b> that appear in that verse and derive: Just as in the case of <i>tokho</i> that is stated with regard to transmitting impurity, the food is impure even though it did not come into contact with the vessel, so too, in the case of <i>tokho</i> that is stated with regard to the vessel becoming impure, the vessel is impure even though the impure item did not come into contact with it.
The Gemara explains: <b>Four</b> instances of the term <b><i>tokho</i></b> from which <i>halakhot</i> can be derived <b>are written: “<i>Tokho</i>”</b> is written, and <b><i>tokh</i></b> could have been written; those are two instances. Then, later in that verse, once again <b>“<i>tokho</i>”</b> is written, and <b><i>tokh</i></b> could have been written.
<b>One</b> instance is <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>itself,</b> that the vessel renders the food in its airspace ritually impure, <b>and one</b> instance is <b>to</b> teach the <b>verbal analogy</b> from which it is derived that the vessel becomes impure without contact with the impure item; <b>and one</b> source is to teach that <b><i>tokho</i>,</b> the airspace, <b>of this</b> earthenware vessel renders the vessel impure, <b>and not <i>tokho</i> of</b> any <b>other</b> kind of vessel; <b>and one</b> source is to teach <b><i>tokho</i>,</b> food in the airspace of an impure earthenware vessel becomes impure, <b>but not <i>tokh tokho</i>,</b> not food that is in the airspace of a vessel that is within an earthenware vessel, <b>and even</b> if that inner vessel is one of the other types of <b>vessel</b> purified through <b>rinsing</b> in the water of a ritual bath.
The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> it be derived that <b>all the</b> other <b>vessels</b> do <b>not become impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>their outer sides, but</b> rather <b>from</b> the presence of an impure item <b>inside them and with contact</b> with their inner sides <b>by means of an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If an earthenware vessel, which becomes impure from</b> the presence of an impure item in <b>its airspace, does not become impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>its outer side,</b> then with regard to <b>all the</b> other <b>vessels, which do not become impure from</b> the presence of an impure item in <b>their airspace, isn’t it logical that they do not become impure from</b> contact of an impure item with <b>their outer side?</b>
The Gemara answers: Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And every open vessel that has no sealed cover upon it is impure”</b> (Numbers 19:15), from which it is derived: <b>This</b> earthenware vessel (see Leviticus 11:33) <b>is</b> the one <b>that when there is not a sealed cover upon it,</b> it is <b>impure, but</b> when <b>there is a sealed cover upon it,</b> it is <b>pure. But</b> with regard to <b>all the</b> other <b>vessels, whether there is a sealed cover upon them or whether there is not a sealed cover upon them, they become impure.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> That which is <b>ritually pure in wooden vessels</b> is <b>ritually impure in metal vessels;</b> that which is <b>ritually pure in metal vessels</b> is <b>ritually impure in wooden vessels.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in explanation of the mishna: <b>Unfinished [<i>golmei</i>] wooden vessels</b> that are receptacles and are fit for use but work remains to complete their crafting are susceptible to becoming <b>impure. Flat</b> wooden utensils are <b>not susceptible to impurity. Unfinished metal vessels</b> are <b>not susceptible to impurity. Flat</b> metal utensils are susceptible to becoming <b>impure. It is found</b> that that which is <b>ritually pure in wooden vessels</b> is <b>ritually impure in metal vessels;</b> that which is <b>ritually pure in metal vessels</b> is <b>ritually impure in wooden vessels.</b>
<b>And these are</b> the <b>unfinished wooden vessels: Any</b> vessel <b>that</b> one plans in the <b>future to smooth, to set</b> gems or ornaments in it, <b>to plane</b> it, <b>to adorn</b> it with grooves and protuberances, <b>to rub</b> it and smooth it <b>with</b> the skin of <b>a tuna [<i>tunas</i>],</b> or if it is <b>lacking a base or a rim or a handle,</b> the vessel is susceptible to becoming <b>impure.</b> If the vessel is <b>lacking</b> the <b>hollowing</b> necessary to render it a receptacle, it is <b>not susceptible to impurity.</b>
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that if the vessel is <b>lacking hollowing,</b> it is not susceptible to becoming impure, as it is clearly not a vessel? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> only in a case <b>where one hollowed three <i>log</i> [<i>kefiza</i>] in</b> a receptacle that he intends to hold <b>one <i>kav</i>,</b> which contains six <i>log</i>. Even though it is a receptacle, since the receptacle is incomplete it is not susceptible to impurity.
<b>And these are</b> the <b>unfinished metal vessels: Any</b> vessel <b>that</b> one plans in the <b>future</b>

Daf 25b

<b>to smooth, to set</b> gems or ornaments in it, <b>to plane</b> it, <b>to adorn</b> it, <b>to strike</b> it <b>with a hammer,</b> or if it is <b>lacking a base or a rim or a handle,</b> the vessel is <b>not susceptible to impurity.</b> If the vessel was complete and was <b>lacking a cover,</b> the vessel is susceptible to becoming <b>impure.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>these</b> unfinished wooden vessels, with regard to which the <i>halakha</i> is that provided they are fit for use they are susceptible to impurity, <b>and what is different</b> about <b>those</b> unfinished metal vessels, with regard to which the <i>halakha</i> is that even if they are fit for use they are not susceptible to impurity until their crafting is complete? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The difference is that <b>since</b> metal vessels <b>are crafted for</b> uses of <b>honor,</b> they are not considered vessels until their completion. <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The difference is that <b>since the worth of</b> metal vessels <b>is expensive,</b> they cannot be sold at that price unless they are complete.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between their</b> opinions? The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between them is</b> with regard to <b>bone vessels</b> crafted from horns, which are expensive but are not crafted for uses of honor. <b>And Rav Naḥman follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rav Naḥman says:</b> The halakhic status of <b>bone vessels</b> with regard to impurity is <b>like</b> that of <b>metal vessels.</b>
The Gemara asks: Is that to say <b>by inference that bone vessels are susceptible to ritual impurity?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “And all work of goats…you shall purify”</b> (Numbers 31:20)? It is <b>to include</b> vessels <b>that come from the goats, from the horns and from the hooves,</b> and indicate that they are susceptible to impurity. And <b>from where</b> is it derived that vessels that come from the horns and the hooves of <b>other domesticated animals and undomesticated animals</b> are susceptible to impurity? It is derived from the verse, as <b>the verse states: “And all work,”</b> where the term “all” is an amplification. <b>If so, why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Goats?”</b> It serves <b>to exclude birds,</b> as vessels crafted from the bones of birds are not susceptible to impurity.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the obligation of separating <i>teruma</i> and tithes, the stage of development <b>that</b> is <b>obligated in bitter almonds</b> is <b>exempt in sweet</b> almonds; and the stage in development <b>that</b> is <b>obligated in sweet</b> almonds is <b>exempt in bitter</b> almonds.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in explanation of the mishna: In the case of <b>bitter almonds,</b> when they are <b>small</b> one is <b>obligated</b> to separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes, as they are not yet bitter and are fit for consumption; when they are <b>large</b> one is <b>exempt</b> from separating <i>teruma</i> and tithes, because they are bitter and unfit for consumption. In the case of <b>sweet</b> almonds, when they are <b>large</b> one is <b>obligated</b> to separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes, because the almonds are ripe and fit for consumption; when they are <b>small</b> one is <b>exempt</b> from separating <i>teruma</i> and tithes, because they are not fit for consumption.
With regard to bitter almonds, <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, says in the name of his father to exempt</b> both <b>this</b> small almond <b>and that</b> large almond. <b>And some say to obligate</b> both <b>this</b> small almond <b>and that</b> large almond. <b>Rabbi Ela said: Rabbi Ḥanina issued a ruling in Tzippori in accordance with the statement of the one who says to exempt</b> both <b>this</b> small almond <b>and that</b> large almond.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says to obligate</b> both <b>this</b> small almond <b>and that</b> large almond, <b>for what</b> use <b>are</b> the <b>large</b> almonds <b>fit?</b> They are bitter and unfit for consumption. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Since one can sweeten them by means of</b> roasting them on <b>the fire,</b> this renders them fit for consumption.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b><i>Temed</i>,</b> a beverage produced from grape residue soaked in water, <b>until it fermented, may not be purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money</b> to be drunk in Jerusalem, because it is not wine. <b>And</b> if three <i>log</i> of it fall into a ritual bath, its halakhic status is that of drawn water and <b>it invalidates the ritual bath. Once it fermented, it</b> is wine, and therefore it <b>may be purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money and it does not invalidate the ritual bath.</b>
With regard to <b>brothers who are partners</b> in the inheritance of their father, <b>when they are obligated to</b> add <b>the premium [<i>kalbon</i>]</b> to their annual half-shekel payment to the Temple, <b>they are exempt from animal tithe; when they are obligated to</b> separate <b>animal tithe, they are exempt from</b> adding <b>the premium.</b> Partners who pay the half-shekel are required to add the premium and are exempt from animal tithe. If they are not true partners, but their inheritance remains the property of the father, the sons are exempt from paying the premium, and they are obligated to separate animal tithe.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to <i>temed</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna?</b> Ostensibly, it is <b>neither</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda nor</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 5:6): With regard to <b>one who prepares <i>temed</i></b> by placing water over grape byproducts, <b>and he placed</b> a certain <b>measure of water, and</b> when measuring the finished product <b>he found</b> its measure <b>equivalent to</b> the <b>measure</b> of water that he placed, he is <b>exempt</b> from the obligation of tithing it, as although it tastes like wine, there is nothing in it but water. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda obligates</b> him to tithe it because the taste determines that it is wine.
<b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in the mishna? <b>If</b> it is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> then if there is no more than the initial measure of water that he placed, he should be exempt <b>even if it fermented. If</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> he holds that one is obligated <b>even if it did not ferment,</b> as taste is his sole criterion. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b>

Daf 26a

It is <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> the <i>temed</i> <b>fermented</b> that there is <b>a dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis. It is only then that Rabbi Yehuda deems him obligated to tithe the <i>temed</i> if it tastes like wine, <b>and the mishna</b> that treats fermented <i>temed</i> like wine is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. And likewise, Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said:</b> It is <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> the <i>temed</i> <b>fermented</b> that there is <b>a dispute.</b>
§ <b>And Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> In a case of unfermented <b><i>temed</i> that one purchased with</b> second-<b>tithe money and</b> that <b>ultimately fermented,</b> the <i>temed</i> <b>he purchased</b> assumes the sanctity of second-<b>tithe</b> produce, and the money is desacralized. <b>What is the reason</b> that the <i>temed</i> assumes the sanctity of second-tithe produce? The reason is that <b>the matter was revealed retroactively,</b> such <b>that</b> when the <i>temed</i> was purchased it <b>was produce</b> fit to be purchased with second-tithe money and was not merely water.
<b>But</b> in that case, <b>the mishna that teaches</b> that if the <i>temed</i> <b>fermented, yes,</b> one may purchase it with second-tithe money, but if it <b>did not ferment,</b> it may <b>not,</b> and the money remains sacred, why does the mishna state it unequivocally? <b>Perhaps, if he</b> would have <b>left</b> the <i>temed</i> long enough, it would <b>have fermented. Rabba said</b> in explanation: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where one left</b> some <b>of</b> the <i>temed</i> <b>in a cup</b> to monitor its status <b>and it did not ferment.</b> Therefore, one may be certain that it was not produce when he purchased it with second-tithe money, and the money remains sacred.
<b>Rava said:</b> It is not necessary to understand the mishna specifically in that manner; rather, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 7:5): In a case where there are <b>three <i>log</i></b> of drawn <b>water less one sixty-fourth of a <i>log</i> [<i>kortov</i>],</b> or any small measure of water, <b>into which a <i>kortov</i> of wine fell,</b> increasing the measure of liquid to a total of three <i>log</i>, <b>and the appearance of</b> those three <i>log</i> is <b>like the appearance of wine, and</b> then those three <i>log</i> <b>fell into a ritual bath,</b> completing its requisite forty <i>se’a</i>, <b>it has not invalidated</b> the ritual bath. The reason is that three <i>log</i> of drawn water invalidate the ritual bath, and less than that measure of water fell into the ritual bath.
Furthermore, in a case where there are <b>three <i>log</i></b> of drawn <b>water less one <i>kortov</i>, into which a <i>kortov</i> of milk fell, and the appearance of</b> those three <i>log</i> is <b>like the appearance of water, and</b> those three <i>log</i> <b>fell into a ritual bath, it has not invalidated</b> the ritual bath, because in this case too, less than three <i>log</i> of drawn water fell into the ritual bath.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: Everything follows the appearance</b> of those three <i>log</i>. Therefore, in the case of a <i>kortov</i> of milk completing the three <i>log</i>, the ritual bath is invalidated because the mixture still has the appearance of water.
Rava reasoned: <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> ben Nuri <b>say</b> that <b>we follow the appearance</b> in determining the halakhic status of the liquid? <b>Here too,</b> in the mishna, <b>follow the appearance</b> in determining the halakhic status of the liquid, <b>and</b> in the case of the <i>temed</i>, as long as it has not yet fermented, <b>the taste and the appearance of that</b> liquid <b>is</b> that of <b>water.</b> By contrast, Rav Naḥman holds in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> in the mishna in tractate <i>Mikvaot</i> that the status of the liquid is not determined by its appearance. Rather, since it ultimately fermented, it became clear retroactively that when the <i>temed</i> was purchased it was produce fit to be purchased with second-tithe money, and was not merely water.
The Gemara resumes its discussion of the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis with regard to which Rav Naḥman said: It is in a case where the <i>temed</i> fermented that there is a dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, and it is only then that Rabbi Yehuda deems one obligated to tithe the <i>temed</i> if it tastes like wine. If it did not yet ferment, even Rabbi Yehuda concedes that one is not obligated to tithe it. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> Rav Naḥman <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar says: Everyone,</b> even Rabbi Yehuda, <b>agrees that one may not separate</b> tithes <b>for</b> this <i>temed</i> <b>from</b> <i>temed</i> in <b>another place, unless it fermented.</b>
Apparently, Rabbi Elazar <b>holds</b> that it is <b>in</b> a case where the <i>temed</i> <b>did not ferment</b> that there is <b>a dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis, <b>and Rabbi Yehuda obligates</b> one to tithe the <i>temed</i> that did not ferment <b>only from</b> that <i>temed</i> <b>itself,</b> because if it ferments it is tithe and if not, he has done nothing. <b>But</b> concerning <i>temed</i> that comes <b>from elsewhere,</b> one may <b>not</b> separate it for this <i>temed</i>, as <b>perhaps</b> he will <b>come to separate</b> tithe <b>from the</b> produce of <b>obligation,</b> i.e., fermented <i>temed</i>, <b>for the</b> produce of <b>exemption,</b> i.e., <i>temed</i> that will not ferment, <b>and from the</b> produce of <b>exemption for the</b> produce of <b>obligation.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b><i>temed</i></b> that became ritually impure, <b>until it ferments,</b>

Daf 26b

<b>one brings</b> the <i>temed</i> <b>into contact with water</b> of a ritual bath by immersing the vessel holding the <i>temed</i> in a ritual bath, thereby purifying the <i>temed</i>. <b>Once it ferments, he does not bring it into contact with water,</b> as that is effective only in purifying water and not in purifying other liquids. <b>Rava said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to a case <b>where one prepared <i>temed</i> with ritually pure water and</b> it later <b>became impure, but</b> if the water was <b>impure from the outset,</b> the contact with the ritual bath would <b>not</b> purify it.
<b>Rav Geviha from Bei Katil went</b> and <b>stated this <i>halakha</i> before Rav Ashi</b> and asked: <b>What is different</b> in the case of water that is <b>impure from the outset</b> such <b>that</b> bringing the <i>temed</i> into contact with the ritual bath would <b>not</b> purify it, <b>as we say: Since the water is heavy it settles</b> at the <b>bottom</b> of the vessel, <b>and the fruit,</b> the grape residue, <b>floats above, and</b> therefore, <b>contact</b> with the water of the ritual bath <b>would not be effective for the water</b> of the <i>temed</i>? <b>If so,</b> the same would apply in the case of water that was <b>ritually pure and ultimately became impure</b> as <i>temed</i> <b>also.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the reason contact is effective in the case of ritually pure water that later became impure as <i>temed</i> is that the water and the residue <b>are intermingled. Here too,</b> in the case of water that was impure from the outset, the water and the residue <b>are intermingled,</b> and contact with the water of a ritual bath would be effective.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any situation where there is sale</b> of one’s daughter as a Hebrew maidservant, i.e., when she is a minor, <b>there is no fine</b> of fifty <i>sela</i> paid to her father if she is raped or seduced, as that fine is paid to her father only when she is a young woman. <b>And any situation where there is a fine</b> paid to the father <b>there is no sale.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: This is the statement of Rabbi Meir, but the Rabbis said: There is</b> the possibility of payment of <b>a fine in a situation</b> where there is <b>sale, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A minor girl from</b> the age of <b>one day old until she</b> reaches puberty and <b>grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs is subject to sale, but is not entitled to</b> receive payment of <b>a fine. Once she</b> reaches puberty and <b>grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs,</b> from that point <b>until she matures</b> into a grown woman <b>she is entitled to</b> receive payment of <b>a fine, but is not subject to sale.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir, as Rabbi Meir would state</b> a principle: <b>Any situation where there is a sale, there is no fine; and any situation where there is a fine, there is no sale.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say: A minor girl from the age of three years and one day until she matures</b> into a grown woman <b>is entitled to</b> receive payment of <b>a fine.</b>
The Gemara asks: Is that to say that <b>yes,</b> she is entitled to payment of <b>a fine,</b> but she is <b>not</b> subject to <b>sale?</b> Isn’t her father permitted to sell her during most of that period? The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the Rabbis said: She is <b>also</b> entitled to receive payment of <b>a fine</b> during that period <b>in a situation</b> where she is subject to <b>sale.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any situation where there is</b> the right of <b>refusal</b> for a minor girl married by her mother or brothers, enabling her to opt out of the marriage, <b>there is no <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> as a minor girl whose husband died without children cannot perform <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>And any situation where there is <i>ḥalitza</i>,</b> once she has reached majority, <b>there is no</b> right of <b>refusal.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: This is the statement of Rabbi Meir, but the Rabbis say: There is</b> the right of <b>refusal in a situation</b> where there is <b><i>ḥalitza</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Until when may a girl refuse?</b> She may do so as long as she is a minor, <b>until she grows two</b> pubic <b>hairs,</b> which are signs of puberty rendering her a young woman; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> She may refuse <b>until the black</b> hairs in the pubic area appear to cover an area <b>greater than the white</b> skin of the area uncovered by hair. At that stage, she is already eligible to perform the rite of <i>ḥalitza</i>. That is the opinion of the Rabbis.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any situation where there is a shofar blast</b> sounded on the eve of Shabbat or a Festival to stop the people from performing labor and to demarcate between the sacred and the profane, <b>there is no <i>havdala</i></b> recited at the conclusion of the Shabbat or Festival in prayer and over a cup of wine. <b>And any situation where there is <i>havdala</i></b> recited, <b>there is no shofar blast</b> sounded.
How so? On <b>a Festival that occurs on Shabbat eve, one sounds</b> the shofar to stop the people from performing labor that is permitted on the Festival and prohibited on Shabbat and to demarcate between one sacred day and another; <b>and one does not recite <i>havdala</i>,</b> as that is recited only when the transition is from a sacred day to a profane day or from a day of greater sanctity to a day of lesser sanctity. The sanctity of Shabbat is greater than the sanctity of the Festival, and therefore <i>havdala</i> is not recited in this case. On a Festival that occurs <b>at the conclusion of Shabbat, one recites <i>havdala</i>, but one does not sound</b> the shofar.
<b>How does one recite <i>havdala</i></b> in that case; i.e., what is the formula of the blessing? It concludes: <b>Who distinguishes between sacred and sacred,</b> as opposed to the standard blessing at the conclusion of Shabbat: Who distinguishes between sacred and profane. <b>Rabbi Dosa says</b> that the formula is: Who distinguishes <b>between greater sanctity and lesser sanctity.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>How does one sound a <i>tekia</i></b> on a Festival that occurs on Shabbat eve, when the difference between the sanctity of the preceding day and the sanctity of the coming day is not as pronounced as it is on a standard Shabbat eve? <b>Rav Yehuda said: One sounds a <i>tekia</i>,</b> i.e., a long continuous shofar blast, <b>and sounds a <i>terua</i>,</b> i.e., a staccato series of shofar blasts, <b>from the midst of the <i>tekia</i>. And Rav Asi said:</b> One does not sound a continuous blast; rather, <b>he sounds a <i>tekia</i> and</b> then <b>sounds a <i>terua</i> in one breath. Rav Asi instituted</b> the practice <b>in</b> the city of <b>Huzal in accordance with his <i>halakha</i>.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statements of Rav Yehuda and Rav Asi from a <i>baraita</i>: On <b>a Festival that occurs on Shabbat eve, one sounds a <i>tekia</i> but does not sound a <i>terua</i>. What, is it not</b> that <b>one does not sound a <i>terua</i> at all?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> rather, <b>Rav Yehuda explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>according to his</b> line of <b>reasoning and Rav Asi explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>according to his</b> line of <b>reasoning. Rav Yehuda explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>according to his</b> line of <b>reasoning: One does not sound a distinct <i>terua</i>; rather,</b> he sounds the <i>terua</i> that emerges <b>from the midst of</b> the <b><i>tekia</i>. And Rav Asi explains</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>according to his</b> line of <b>reasoning: One does not sound</b> the <i>tekia</i> and <b>the <i>terua</i> in two breaths; rather,</b> he sounds them <b>in one breath.</b>
§ The mishna states that on a Festival that occurs <b>at the conclusion of Shabbat</b> one recites <i>havdala</i>, and that the Sages disagreed as to the formula of that blessing. The Gemara asks: <b>Where does one recite</b> the formula in question? <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> He recites the formula <b>at the conclusion of</b> the blessing. But in the body of the blessing one recites the same formula as in every conclusion of Shabbat: Who distinguishes between sacred and profane, between light and darkness, etc. <b>And likewise, Rav Naḥman said:</b> He recites the formula <b>at the conclusion of</b> the blessing.
<b>And Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said:</b> One recites that formula <b>even at the beginning,</b> in the body of the blessing, instead of the formula: Who distinguishes between sacred and profane. The Gemara comments: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with his</b> opinion.
The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Dosa says</b> that the formula is: Who distinguishes <b>between greater sanctity and lesser sanctity.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with his</b> opinion.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> At the conclusion of <b>a Festival that occurs in the middle of the week, one recites: Who distinguishes between sacred and profane, and between light and darkness, and between Israel and the nations, and between the seventh day and the six days of labor,</b> even though it is not Shabbat. <b>What is the reason</b> for that practice? <b>He is enumerating the series of distinctions</b> that the Sages instituted and not specifically the distinction unique to that particular day.

Daf 27a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> by cutting <b>one</b> <i>siman</i>, i.e., the windpipe or the gullet, <b>in a bird, and two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>in an animal, his slaughter is valid, and</b> the halakhic status of <b>the majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>is like</b> that of the entire <i>siman</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The slaughter is not valid <b>until he cuts the veins [<i>haveridin</i>],</b> i.e., the major blood vessels in the neck. If one cut <b>half of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>in a bird or one and a half</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>in an animal, his slaughter is not valid.</b> If one cut <b>the majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>in a bird or the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>in an animal, his slaughter is valid.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the term: <b>One who slaughters,</b> that if one slaughtered, then <b>after the fact, yes,</b> the slaughter is valid; but <b><i>ab initio</i>, no,</b> it is prohibited. The Gemara asks: Is the ruling with regard to the cutting of <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>in an animal</b> that <b><i>ab initio</i>, no,</b> it is prohibited? If so, <b>how much</b> is one expected <b>to continue and cut</b> the <i>simanim</i>, <i>ab initio</i>? There are only two relevant <i>simanim</i> to be cut. The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the reference is <b>to</b> the cutting of <b>one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>in a bird,</b> as one is required to cut both <i>simanim</i> in a bird <i>ab initio</i>. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the reference is <b>to</b> the passage in the mishna that states that the halakhic status of <b>the majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>is like</b> that of the entire <i>siman</i>, as one is required to cut the entire <i>siman ab initio</i>.
§ <b><i>Kaf</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>shin</i></b> is <b>a mnemonic</b> for the sources of the statements cited in the discussion that follows: Rav Kahana, Rav Yeimar, and the school of Rabbi Yishmael.
<b>Rav Kahana says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to slaughter that it is</b> performed <b>from the neck?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall slaughter [<i>veshaḥat</i>] the young bull</b> before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5), which is interpreted homiletically: <b>From the place where</b> the animal <b>bends [<i>shaḥ</i>], purify it [<i>ḥattehu</i>]</b> through slaughter. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> does one ascertain <b>that this</b> term, <b><i>ḥattehu</i>, is an expression of purification?</b> The Gemara answers: It is ascertained from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And he shall purify [<i>veḥitte</i>] the house”</b> (Leviticus 14:52). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is ascertained <b>from here: “Purge me [<i>teḥatte’eni</i>] with hyssop and I will be pure”</b> (Psalms 51:9).
The Gemara challenges: <b>And say</b> that slaughter is <b>from its tail,</b> which is also a place in the animal’s body that is bent. The Gemara responds: From the term: <b>Bends [<i>shaḥ</i>],</b> one can conclude <b>by inference that we require</b> a part of the animal’s body that can stand <b>erect</b> and that bends; <b>and this,</b> the tail, <b>is bent perpetually</b> and is never erect. The Gemara challenges: <b>And say</b> that slaughter is <b>from its ear,</b> which is erect and bends. The Gemara explains: <b>We require</b> that slaughter be performed on a part of the animal’s body from which <b>blood of the soul</b> is spilled, <b>and</b> when one cuts the ear <b>there is no</b> blood of the soul spilled.
The Gemara asks: <b>And say that one rends</b> the animal starting from the ear <b>and continues until the blood of the soul</b> is spilled. <b>And furthermore,</b> with regard to those actions that invalidate slaughter, i.e., <b>interrupting</b> the slaughter, <b>pressing</b> the knife, <b>concealing</b> the knife in the course of an inverted slaughter, <b>diverting</b> the knife from the place of slaughter, <b>and ripping</b> the <i>simanim</i> from their place before cutting them, <b>from where do we</b> derive them? <b>Rather,</b> these disqualifications are learned through <b>tradition,</b> i.e., a <i>halakha</i> transmitted to Moses from Sinai. The requirement of <b>slaughter from the neck is also</b> learned through <b>tradition,</b> and has no biblical source.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if the <i>halakha</i> is derived through tradition, <b>what</b> <i>halakha</i> does <b>the verse:</b> “And you shall slaughter,” <b>come to</b> teach? The Gemara answers: The verse serves to teach <b>that</b> one should <b>not</b> sever the head completely from the animal’s body and <b>render it a broken</b> animal. He cuts only the windpipe and the gullet, which are adjacent to the major blood vessels.
<b>Rav Yeimar says:</b> From where is it derived that slaughter is performed from the neck? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “And you shall slaughter [<i>vezavaḥta</i>]</b> of your herd and of your flock” (Deuteronomy 12:21), which is interpreted homiletically: <b>From the place where</b> the blood <b>flows [<i>shezav</i>], break it [<i>ḥattehu</i>],</b> i.e., cut it. The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> term, <b><i>ḥattehu</i>, is an expression of breaking?</b> The Gemara answers: It is inferred from a verse, <b>as it is written: “Neither fear nor be dismayed [<i>teḥat</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:21); ensure that your spirit will not be broken.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And say</b> that an animal is slaughtered <b>from its nose,</b> from which mucus flows, as the verse did not mention blood. The Gemara responds: <b>We require</b> a fluid that <b>flows by means of breaking, and this</b> mucus <b>flows on its own.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>And say</b> that an animal is slaughtered <b>from its heart</b> by means of stabbing. <b>And furthermore,</b> with regard to those actions that invalidate slaughter, i.e., <b>interrupting, pressing</b> the knife during slaughter, <b>concealing</b> the knife in the course of an inverted slaughter, <b>diverting</b> the knife from the place of slaughter, <b>and ripping, from where do we</b> derive them? <b>Rather,</b> these disqualifications are learned through <b>tradition.</b> The requirement of <b>slaughter from the neck is also</b> learned through <b>tradition.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if the <i>halakha</i> is derived through tradition, <b>what</b> <i>halakha</i> does the phrase in <b>the verse:</b> “And you shall slaughter” <b>come to</b> teach? The Gemara answers: The phrase serves to teach <b>that</b> one should <b>not</b> sever the head completely from the animal’s body and <b>render it a broken</b> animal. He cuts only the windpipe and the gullet.
<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> From where is it derived that slaughter is performed from the neck? It is derived from a verse, as it is stated: <b>“And he shall slaughter [<i>veshaḥat</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 1:5). <b>Do not read</b> it as: <b><i>Veshaḥat</i>; rather,</b> read it as: <b><i>Vesaḥat</i>,</b> which literally means: And he shall squeeze, which is interpreted homiletically: <b>From the place where</b> the animal <b>speaks [<i>saḥ</i>], purify it [<i>ḥattehu</i>].</b> The animal’s voice emanates from its throat; therefore, it is slaughtered from the neck.
The Gemara objects: <b>And say</b> that slaughter is <b>from its tongue.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>We require</b> that slaughter be performed on a part of the animal’s body from which <b>blood of the soul</b> is spilled, <b>and</b> when one cuts the tongue <b>there is no</b> blood of the soul spilled. The Gemara objects: <b>And say that one rends</b> the animal starting from the tongue <b>and continues until the blood of the soul</b> is spilled. <b>And furthermore,</b> with regard to those actions that invalidate slaughter, i.e., <b>interrupting, pressing</b> the knife, <b>concealing</b> the knife, <b>diverting</b> the knife, <b>and ripping, from where do we</b> derive them? <b>Rather,</b> these disqualifications are learned through <b>tradition.</b> The requirement of <b>slaughter from the neck is also</b> learned through <b>tradition.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if the <i>halakha</i> is derived through tradition, <b>what</b> <i>halakha</i> does the phrase in <b>the verse:</b> “And you shall slaughter,” <b>come to</b> teach? The Gemara answers: The phrase serves to teach <b>that</b> one should <b>not</b> sever the head completely from the animal’s body and <b>render it a broken</b> animal. He cuts only the windpipe and the gullet.
<b>And a <i>tanna</i></b> who recited <i>mishnayot</i> and <i>baraitot</i> in the study hall <b>cites</b> the source for the <i>halakha</i> that slaughter is performed from the neck <b>from here: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to slaughter that it is</b> performed <b>from the neck?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall arrange the pieces,</b> the head, and the fat…upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:8).
Rabbi Ḥiyya explains: <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state: “The head, and the fat.” What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “The head, and the fat”? Weren’t the head and the fat</b> included <b>in</b> the <b>category of all the pieces,</b> mentioned earlier in the verse? <b>For what</b> purpose did <b>they emerge</b> from the category and warrant individual mention? This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated: “And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it</b> into its pieces” (Leviticus 1:6). One might have thought that <b>I have</b> derived that <b>only the pieces that are</b> included <b>in the category of flaying</b> must be arranged on the altar. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include the head, which was already</b> partially <b>severed</b> when the animal was slaughtered, and is not flayed? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “With its head and its fat, and</b> the priest <b>shall arrange</b> them” (Leviticus 1:12).
The <i>tanna</i> concludes: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>says: The head, which was already</b> partially <b>severed,</b> one learns <b>by inference that slaughter is from the neck,</b> as the neck connects the head to the body.
The Gemara questions the formulation of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And the <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>opened with</b> a question about the extraneous phrase written with regard to a bull burnt offering: <b>“The head, and the fat”</b> (Leviticus 1:8), <b>and concludes with</b> an explanation of the phrase written with regard to a sheep burnt offering: <b>“Its head and its fat”</b> (Leviticus 1:12). The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: From where</b> is it derived <b>to include the head, which was already</b> partially <b>severed?</b> It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “The head, and the fat”</b> (Leviticus 1:8).
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse cited at the end of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Its head and its fat”?</b> The Gemara answers: The verse <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that the head and the fat precede all the</b> other <b>pieces</b>when the sacrificial portions are sacrificed on the altar? <b>The verse states: “With its head and its fat, and</b> the priest <b>shall arrange</b> them” (Leviticus 1:12).

Daf 27b

The Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>the first</b> mention of <b>fat that the Merciful One writes:</b> “The pieces, the head, and the fat” (Leviticus 1:8)? Wasn’t the derivation from that verse restricted to the head? The Gemara answers that it is <b>necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How does</b> the priest who elevates the sacrificial portions of the animal to the altar <b>perform</b> that task? <b>He</b> uses <b>the fat</b> to <b>cover the place of slaughter,</b> i.e., to conceal the bloody neck, <b>and elevates</b> the head to the top of the altar, <b>and that is a deferential manner</b> toward <b>the Most High.</b>
<b>And this <i>tanna</i> cites</b> proof that slaughter is from the neck <b>from here: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Torah writes with regard to the impurity of carcasses: <b>“This is the law of the animal, and of the bird”</b> (Leviticus 11:46), indicating that the two are somehow equated. <b>But with regard to what law is an animal equal to a bird and a bird to an animal?</b> The <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity governing animals and birds are not comparable; <b>an animal imparts impurity by contact and by carrying,</b> whereas <b>a bird does not impart impurity by contact or by carrying.</b> Furthermore, <b>a bird renders</b> the <b>garments</b> of one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat; an animal does not render</b> one’s <b>garments impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>With regard to what law is an animal equal to a bird and a bird to an animal?</b> The verse comes <b>to say to you: Just as an animal</b> avoids the impurity of being an unslaughtered carcass <b>through slaughter, so too, a bird</b> avoids the impurity of being an unslaughtered carcass <b>through slaughter.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>If</b> so, say, based on the same juxtaposition: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of an animal, it avoids the impurity <b>through</b> the cutting of <b>the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>, i.e., the windpipe and the gullet, <b>so too here,</b> in the case of a bird, it avoids the impurity <b>through</b> the cutting of <b>the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>. The Gemara explains that <b>the verse states: “This</b> is the law,” to restrict the scope of the juxtaposition in the sense that not all of the <i>halakhot</i> of birds and animals are equal.
The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: With regard to what law is an animal equal to a bird and a bird to an animal?</b> The verse comes <b>to say to you: Just as</b> in the case of <b>a bird, its fitness</b> for sacrifice and for consumption is accomplished through pinching and slaughter <b>from the neck,</b> as the Torah states with regard to bird offerings that one pinches off its head from the neck, <b>so too,</b> in the case of <b>an animal, its fitness</b> for sacrifice and for consumption is accomplished through slaughter <b>from the neck.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>If</b> so, say, based on the same juxtaposition: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of a bird, the pinching is performed <b>adjacent to</b> the <b>nape</b> of the neck, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to an animal, the slaughter is performed <b>adjacent to</b> the <b>nape</b> of the neck and not from the throat. The Gemara explains that therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a bird: <b>“And pinch off its head adjacent to its nape, but shall not divide it asunder”</b> (Leviticus 5:8), from which it is derived: <b>Its head,</b> i.e., the bird’s head, is pinched <b>adjacent</b> to the <b>nape, but the head of another,</b> the animal, <b>is not</b> cut <b>adjacent</b> to the <b>nape.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Eliezer, what does he do with this</b> term: <b>“This</b> is the law,” from which the first <i>tanna</i> restricted the scope of the juxtaposition between animals and birds? The Gemara answers: <b>If not</b> for the derivation from the term <b>“This</b> is the law,” <b>I would say: Just as</b> the fitness of <b>a bird</b> is accomplished <b>by</b> cutting <b>one of the <i>simanim</i> that must be severed in ritual slaughter,</b> i.e., either the windpipe or the gullet, <b>so too,</b> the fitness of <b>an animal</b> is accomplished <b>by</b> cutting <b>one <i>siman</i>.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “This</b> is the law,” to restrict the juxtaposition.
§ The Gemara proceeds to discuss the source for the slaughter of non-sacred birds. <b>Bar Kappara teaches</b> that the verse states: <b>“This is the law of the animal, and of the bird,</b> and of every living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature that swarms upon the earth” (Leviticus 11:46). <b>The verse situated the bird between</b> the <b>animal and</b> the <b>fish. To require</b> the cutting of the <b>two <i>simanim</i></b> that must be severed in ritual slaughter, i.e., the windpipe and the gullet, for the slaughter of a bird, <b>is impossible, as it was already juxtaposed to fish,</b> which do not require slaughter at all. <b>To exempt it with nothing,</b> i.e., to exempt the bird from slaughter altogether, <b>is impossible, as it was already juxtaposed to</b> the <b>animal. How,</b> then, <b>is fitness</b> of a bird for consumption accomplished? It is rendered fit <b>with</b> the cutting of <b>one <i>siman</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>fish are not subject to slaughter? If we say</b> that it is <b>because it is written: “If flocks and herds be slaughtered for them…or if all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,</b> will they suffice them” (Numbers 11:22), which indicates that <b>mere gathering suffices for them,</b> that is not a proof.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>But if that is so, with regard to quail</b> as well, concerning <b>which it is written:</b> “And the people rose up…<b>and gathered the quail”</b> (Numbers 11:32), <b>so too,</b> would one say with regard to birds <b>that,</b> like fish, their fitness is <b>not</b> accomplished <b>with slaughter?</b> The Gemara responds with a question. <b>But didn’t you say: To exempt</b> birds from slaughter altogether <b>with nothing is impossible, as it was already juxtaposed to</b> the <b>animal?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There, gathering</b> of quail <b>is not written in</b> the <b>context</b> of the <b>slaughter of others;</b> therefore, gathering is not to be understood as an alternative to slaughtering the birds. <b>Here, gathering</b> of fish <b>is written in</b> the <b>context</b> of the <b>slaughter of others,</b> i.e., the flocks and herds, which indicates that gathering is an alternative to slaughter.
The Gemara relates that <b>a passerby from the Galilee taught: Fitness</b> for consumption of <b>animals, which were created from the</b> dry <b>land,</b> is accomplished <b>through</b> cutting <b>two <i>simanim</i>,</b> the gullet and the windpipe. <b>Fitness</b> for consumption of <b>fish, which were created from the water,</b> is accomplished <b>with nothing,</b> as no slaughter is required. <b>Fitness</b> for consumption of <b>birds, which were created from mud [<i>harekak</i>],</b> a combination of dry land and water, is accomplished <b>through</b> cutting <b>one <i>siman</i>. Rav Shmuel of Cappadocia says: Know</b> that <b>birds</b> were created from a combination of dry land and water, <b>as they have scales on their feet like fish.</b>
The Gemara relates an excerpt of an exchange between a Roman government official and Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai. <b>And furthermore,</b> the official <b>asked</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: <b>One verse states: “And God said: Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creeping animals, and birds will fly”</b> (Genesis 1:20); <b>apparently</b> birds <b>were created from the water. And it is written: “And from the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the air</b> and brought them unto the man to see what he would call them” (Genesis 2:19); <b>apparently</b> birds <b>were created from the land.</b>
Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to him: They were created from the mud. He saw his students looking at each other,</b> wondering. <b>He said to them: Does it trouble you that I dismissed my enemy with a flimsy</b> pretext? Actually, it is <b>from water</b> that birds <b>were created. And why</b> does the verse state that they were formed from the ground and that God <b>brought them to Adam?</b> In other words, why are they mentioned in the second verse? It is not because they were actually formed from the ground, but only because they were brought to Adam so that <b>he would call them names.</b>
<b>And some say</b> that Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai spoke <b>to that officer with a different formulation,</b> i.e., he said to him that the birds were created from the water. <b>And he stated the first formulation,</b> that the birds were created from the mud, <b>to his students, because it is written: “And</b> from the ground the Lord God <b>formed</b> every beast of the field, and every bird of the air” (Genesis 2:19). According to this explanation, the birds are mentioned there not only because Adam called them names, but also because they too were created from the ground.
On the matter of slaughtering birds, <b>Rav Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Pineḥas: Slaughter of a bird is not</b> obligatory <b>by Torah law, as it is stated:</b> “And whatever man there be of the children of Israel…who traps any undomesticated animal or bird that may be eaten, <b>he shall spill its blood,</b> and cover it in earth” (Leviticus 17:13). This indicates that <b>mere spilling</b> of its blood <b>is sufficient.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> with regard to <b>an undomesticated animal,</b> which is mentioned in the same verse, spilling should be sufficient <b>also.</b> The Gemara explains: An undomesticated animal <b>is juxtaposed to disqualified consecrated</b> animals, for which slaughter is required, as explained later in the Gemara (28a). The Gemara asks: <b>Birds too are juxtaposed to animals,</b> and therefore slaughter should be required, <b>as it is written: “This is the law of the animal, and of the bird”</b> (Leviticus 11:46). The Gemara answers: <b>But isn’t it written: “He shall spill its blood,”</b> indicating that slaughter is not required?
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> concerning the derivation that slaughter is not required, based on the phrase in the verse “He shall spill,” <b>what did you see that</b> led you to <b>cast it upon,</b> i.e., apply it to, the case of <b>a bird?</b> Why not <b>cast it upon</b> the case of <b>an undomesticated animal?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> to cast the derivation upon the case of a bird <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the verse <b>concluded with</b> the bird, i.e., the bird is mentioned just prior to the directive to spill and cover the blood, as it is written: “Who traps any undomesticated animal or bird that may be eaten, he shall spill its blood.”
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the proofs cited in the Gemara with regard to the slaughter of birds: <b>Became a carcass, blood, through pinching.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Pineḥas from a mishna (85a): <b>One who slaughters</b> an undomesticated animal <b>and it became</b> an unslaughtered <b>carcass by his hand</b> because the slaughter was not valid, or <b>one who stabbed</b> the animal by slicing the length of the <i>simanim</i>, <b>or one who ripped</b> the gullet or windpipe of the animal, rendering the slaughter not valid, <b>is exempt from covering</b> the blood because his slaughter was ineffective in permitting consumption of the animal, and it is written that the requirement of covering the blood applies only to “any undomesticated animal or bird that may be eaten.” <b>And if you say</b> that <b>slaughter of a bird is not</b> obligatory <b>by Torah law,</b> the halakhic status of <b>its stabbing is</b> like that of <b>its slaughter; let</b> its blood <b>require covering.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Do you maintain</b> that this mishna is referring <b>to a bird? No,</b> it is referring exclusively <b>to an undomesticated animal.</b>
The Gemara cites another challenge: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who slaughters</b> an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>and requires the blood</b> and not the animal <b>is obligated to cover</b> the blood. Rather, <b>how does he act</b> if he seeks to make use of the blood rather than cover it? He <b>either stabs</b> the animal <b>or rips</b> the <i>simanim</i>, and then he is exempt from covering the blood.

Daf 28a

<b>What, is it not</b> referring <b>to a bird, as he requires its blood to</b> remove <b>a moth</b> from his garments? If so, apparently birds require slaughter by Torah law, as, if that were not the case, then even if a bird were stabbed, covering of the blood would be required. The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to an undomesticated animal, as he requires its blood to</b> use as a red <b>dye [<i>lelakka</i>]</b> Therefore, no proof may be cited from this <i>baraita</i> that birds require slaughter by Torah law.
The Gemara cites proof from a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 68a): <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> If <b>one cut</b> the nape of the neck of a sacrificial bird <b>with a knife</b> instead of pinching it with his fingernail, this bird carcass <b>renders</b> the <b>garments</b> of one who eats the bird <b>ritually impure</b> when the meat is <b>in</b> his <b>throat.</b> The Gemara explains the proof: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>slaughter of a bird is not</b> obligatory <b>by Torah law,</b> then <b>although when</b> cutting the bird from the nape, <b>he breaks the spine and the neck bone</b> with the knife before severing the gullet and windpipe, and <b>it indeed becomes a <i>tereifa</i></b> and may not be eaten, cutting the <i>simanim</i> with the <b>knife should be effective to purify it,</b> i.e., to prevent it <b>from</b> assuming the status of <b>an unslaughtered carcass.</b> The fact that the garments of one who swallows the meat of the bird become ritually impure indicates that slaughter is the only method effective in permitting the consumption of a bird and for preventing it from assuming the status of an unslaughtered carcass.
The Gemara rejects that proof: Although it is clear from that mishna that slaughter of birds is obligatory by Torah law, Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Pineḥas <b>states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i></b> who holds that it is not obligatory by Torah law, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar, the distinguished Sage, says: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “However, as the gazelle</b> and as the deer <b>is eaten,</b> so shall you eat of it” (Deuteronomy 12:22)? <b>And what now have we derived from the gazelle and the deer</b> with regard to disqualified consecrated animals?
These two undomesticated animals <b>come</b> in the verse <b>to teach</b> a <i>halakha</i> with regard to disqualified consecrated animals, <b>and</b> it is <b>found</b> that a <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived</b> from the case of disqualified consecrated animals in their regard. The Torah <b>juxtaposes a gazelle and a deer to disqualified consecrated animals</b> to teach: <b>Just as disqualified consecrated animals</b> are rendered fit for consumption <b>through slaughter, so too, a gazelle and a deer</b> are rendered fit for consumption only <b>through slaughter. But</b> for <b>a bird, slaughter is not</b> obligatory <b>by Torah law; rather,</b> the obligation is <b>by rabbinic law.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with Rabbi Elazar HaKappar</b> and holds that the slaughter of a bird is obligatory by Torah law? <b>It is Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The Torah states: <b>“And you shall slaughter</b> of your herd and of your flock, which the Lord has given you, <b>as I have commanded you”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21). <b>This</b> verse <b>teaches that Moses was</b> previously <b>commanded</b> about the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter, even though they are not written explicitly in the Torah. He was commanded <b>about</b> cutting <b>the gullet and about</b> cutting <b>the windpipe, and about the</b> requirement to cut the <b>majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>for a bird, and the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>for an animal.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that in the case of one who cuts <b>one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>in a bird,</b> his slaughter is valid. <b>It was stated</b> that there is an amoraic dispute with regard to this matter. <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> One may cut <b>either the gullet or the windpipe. Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> One must cut the <b>gullet</b> for the slaughter to be valid, <b>but</b> cutting <b>the windpipe</b> is <b>not</b> sufficient. The Gemara explains the formulation of the mishna according to the opinion of each <i>amora</i>. <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> One may cut <b>either the gullet or the windpipe. One</b> <i>siman</i> <b>is taught</b> in the mishna, meaning that the slaughter is valid if he severs <b>one,</b> indicating that <b>either</b> <i>siman</i> is valid. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> One must cut the <b>gullet</b> for the slaughter to be valid, <b>but</b> cutting <b>the windpipe</b> is <b>not</b> sufficient. <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>One,</b> in the mishna? It means the <b>special</b> one, the gullet.
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the proofs to be cited by the Gemara: <b>Slaughter, halves, windpipe, deficiency, of a bird sin offering.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Naḥman from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one cut the</b> bird’s <b>gullet and thereafter the windpipe was displaced,</b> the slaughter <b>is valid.</b> If <b>the windpipe was displaced and thereafter he cut the gullet,</b> the slaughter <b>is not valid.</b> With regard to a case where <b>one cut the gullet and the windpipe was found displaced and he does not know if it was displaced prior to the slaughter or if it was displaced after the slaughter, that was an incident</b> that transpired, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>said:</b> In <b>any</b> case of <b>uncertainty with regard to slaughter,</b> the slaughter <b>is not valid.</b> The <i>baraita</i> mentions only the case of cutting the gullet, <b>while cutting the windpipe is not taught.</b> The <i>baraita</i> supports the opinion of Rav Adda bar Ahava and is contrary to the opinion of Rav Naḥman.
The Gemara rejects that proof: The <i>baraita</i> mentions only the cutting of the gullet and displacement of the windpipe not because slaughter may be performed only by cutting the gullet. Rather, those scenarios were mentioned <b>because the windpipe,</b> unlike the gullet, <b>is likely to be displaced.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof contrary to the opinion of Rav Naḥman from a <i>baraita</i>. If one <b>cut two halves,</b> one half of each <b>of the <i>simanim</i>, in a bird,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid,</b> as the requirement is that a majority of one <i>siman</i> is cut; <b>and needless to say</b> the slaughter performed in that manner is not valid <b>in</b> the case of <b>an animal,</b> where the requirement is that a majority of both <i>simanim</i> are cut. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: In a bird</b> the slaughter is not valid <b>until he cuts the gullet and the veins;</b> the veins must be cut so that the blood will drain from the body. The fact that Rabbi Yehuda mentions cutting only the gullet and not the windpipe indicates that slaughter is valid only when the gullet is cut. The Gemara rejects that proof: Rabbi Yehuda mentions only the gullet <b>because</b> the <b>gullet is adjacent to the veins.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof in support of the opinion of Rav Naḥman from a <i>baraita</i>. If one <b>cut half</b> the <b>windpipe and interrupted</b> the slaughter for an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of the <b>slaughter</b> of <b>another</b> animal, <b>and</b> then <b>completed his slaughter,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid</b> and it is not invalidated due to an interrupted slaughter. <b>What, is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> referring to the slaughter <b>of a bird? And what</b> does the term: <b>Completed it,</b> mean in the <i>baraita</i>? Doesn’t it mean that he <b>completed</b> cutting <b>the windpipe,</b> which he had started cutting, indicating that with the cutting of the windpipe the slaughter is valid, in accordance with the opinion of Rav Naḥman as opposed to the opinion of Rav Adda bar Ahava? The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to slaughter <b>of an animal,</b> for which both <i>simanim</i> must be cut. <b>And what</b> does the term: <b>Completed it,</b> mean in the <i>baraita</i>? It means that he <b>completed the entire slaughter.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof in support of the opinion of Rav Naḥman from a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>half of the windpipe was deficient,</b> i.e., somewhat cut, prior to the slaughter <b>and</b> the slaughterer <b>added to</b> that deficiency an incision of <b>any size, and completed it, his slaughter is valid. What, is it not</b> referring to the slaughter of <b>a bird? And what</b> does the term: <b>Completed it,</b> mean in the <i>baraita</i>? Doesn’t it mean that he <b>completed</b> cutting the majority of the <b>windpipe,</b> indicating that cutting the windpipe renders the bird fit for consumption? The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to slaughter <b>of an animal,</b> for which both <i>simanim</i> must be cut. <b>And what</b> does the term: <b>Completed it,</b> mean in the <i>baraita</i>? It means that he <b>completed</b> the entire slaughter by cutting <b>the gullet.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof in support of the opinion of Rav Naḥman from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How does one pinch</b> the nape of the neck of <b>a bird sin offering?</b> Using his thumbnail, the priest <b>cuts the spine and the neck bone, without</b> cutting through <b>the majority of</b> the surrounding <b>flesh until he reaches</b> either <b>the gullet or the windpipe. Once he reaches the gullet or the windpipe, he cuts one <i>siman</i></b> with his nail <b>and a majority of</b> the surrounding <b>flesh with it. And in</b> the case of a bird <b>burnt offering,</b> he cuts the <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>or the majority of the two</b> <i>simanim</i>. The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> from this <i>baraita</i> is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about the matter?</b> The Gemara asks in response: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about the matter?</b> It is <b>as you said,</b> that the opinion of Rav Adda bar Ahava was conclusively refuted. The Gemara says that there is not absolute proof from the <i>baraita</i>, as <b>perhaps it is different there</b> with regard to pinching, <b>as</b> in that case <b>there is</b> the <b>spine and</b> the <b>neck bone</b> that are cut initially, and therefore cutting the windpipe is sufficient. But in the case of slaughter of a non-sacred bird, perhaps only if one cuts the gullet the slaughter is valid.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> then is the <i>halakha</i> in the case of slaughter? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the following incident, <b>that</b> there was <b>a certain duck that was in the house of Rava,</b> which <b>came</b> for slaughter <b>with its neck filthy with blood</b> and they did not know whether the blood was the result of its windpipe having been severed or its gullet having been perforated, in which cases the duck is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rava said: What should we do</b> with regard to this duck?

Daf 28b

If one suggests: <b>Let</b> us <b>slaughter it and then we will examine it</b> to determine whether its windpipe was severed or its gullet was perforated, that is difficult, because <b>perhaps</b> the slaughterer <b>will slaughter</b> the duck precisely <b>in the place of the perforation</b> and it will be impossible to determine whether the gullet was perforated before the slaughter. If one suggests: <b>Let</b> us slice open the hide and <b>examine</b> the <i>simanim</i> <b>and then we will slaughter it,</b> that is difficult, because <b>didn’t Rabba say: The gullet has no</b> possible <b>examination from without,</b> as its outer side is red, and a small perforation would be indiscernible, <b>but</b> only <b>from within,</b> as its inner side is white, and blood at the site of the perforation would be discerned?
<b>Rav Yosef, son</b> of Rava, <b>said to him: Let us examine the windpipe,</b> as it is possible to discern from without whether the majority of the windpipe was severed, <b>and</b> then <b>cut the</b> duck’s <b>windpipe and</b> thereby <b>render it permitted,</b> as cutting either of the two <i>simanim</i> suffices in a bird. <b>And then let us turn the gullet inside out and examine its</b> inner side to determine whether it was perforated and the duck is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rava said: My son Yosef is as wise in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>tereifot</i> as Rabbi Yoḥanan. Apparently, one</b> <i>siman</i>, <b>which is taught</b> in the mishna as being sufficient in the slaughter of a bird, means <b>either this</b> <i>siman</i>, the gullet, <b>or that</b> <i>siman</i>, the windpipe.
§ The mishna states: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The slaughter is not valid <b>until he cuts</b> the veins in the neck. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Rav Yehuda said</b> that one must cut the veins <b>only</b> in the slaughter of <b>a bird, as</b> one typically <b>roasts it in its entirety as one</b> whole entity; therefore, one must cut the veins to ensure that the blood drains. <b>But</b> with regard to the slaughter of <b>an animal, since it is</b> typically <b>quartered</b> into <b>limbs,</b> resulting in the blood draining more readily, one <b>need not</b> cut the veins.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that the reason that Rabbi Yehuda</b> requires cutting of the veins <b>is due to</b> the need to drain the <b>blood? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The slaughter is not valid <b>until he cuts [<i>sheyishḥot</i>] the veins,</b> indicating that the cutting of the veins is a component of the slaughter [<i>sheḥita</i>]?
The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda’s statement is <b>until he punctures the veins. And what</b> is the meaning of: <b>Until he cuts? Until he punctures</b> the veins <b>at the moment of slaughter,</b> when the blood flows.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof rejecting this interpretation of Rabbi Yehuda’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The veins through slaughter,</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> which indicates that the cutting of the veins is a component of slaughter. The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>Say</b> that the correct reading of the <i>baraita</i> is: <b>He must puncture the veins at the moment of slaughter;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from a <i>baraita</i>: The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yehuda: Since veins were mentioned only to drain blood from them, what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> whether one cuts them as a component <b>of slaughter,</b> and <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> whether one cuts them <b>not</b> as a component <b>of slaughter?</b> One can learn <b>by inference</b> from this <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that one cuts the veins as a component <b>of slaughter.</b>
The Gemara rejects this proof. <b>This is</b> what the Rabbis <b>are saying</b> to Rabbi Yehuda: <b>What</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> whether one <b>punctures them at the moment of slaughter,</b> and <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> whether one <b>punctures them not at the moment of slaughter?</b> One can puncture the veins after the slaughter. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that <b>at the time of slaughter the blood emerges</b> from the body quickly <b>because</b> the blood <b>is warm;</b> when it is <b>not at the time of slaughter, the blood does not emerge</b> from the body quickly <b>because it is cool.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> In cutting the <b>veins according to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> if one <b>interrupted</b> the act in the midst of cutting <b>them,</b> or if <b>he pressed</b> the knife and cut <b>them</b> instead of drawing the knife back and forth, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do these actions, which invalidate slaughter when cutting the <i>simanim</i>, also invalidate slaughter when performed in the cutting of the veins?
<b>A certain elder said to him: This is</b> what <b>Rabbi Elazar said; and some say</b> that <b>a certain elder said to Rabbi Elazar</b> that <b>this is what Rabbi Yoḥanan said: He punctures</b> the veins <b>with a thorn and their</b> cutting is <b>valid.</b> Cutting the veins is not a component of the slaughter.
The Gemara notes that it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda</b> that Rabbi Yehuda requires cutting of the veins only in the slaughter of birds, and not in the slaughter of animals. If one <b>cut two halves,</b> one half of each <b>of the <i>simanim</i>, in a bird,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid, and needless to say</b> the slaughter performed in that manner is not valid <b>in</b> the case of <b>an animal. Rabbi Yehuda says: In a bird</b> the slaughter is not valid <b>until he cuts the gullet and the veins.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If one cut <b>half of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>in a bird</b> or one and a half <i>simanim</i> in an animal, his slaughter is not valid. <b>It was stated</b> that there is an amoraic dispute. <b>Rav said:</b> The halakhic status of a <i>siman</i> of which precisely <b>half</b> was cut and <b>half</b> remained uncut <b>is like</b> that of a <i>siman</i> of which the <b>majority</b> was cut. <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> The halakhic status of a <i>siman</i> of which precisely <b>half</b> was cut and <b>half</b> remained uncut <b>is not like</b> that of a <i>siman</i> of which the <b>majority</b> was cut.
The Gemara elaborates. <b>Rav said:</b> The halakhic status of a <i>siman</i> of which precisely <b>half</b> was cut and <b>half</b> remained uncut <b>is like</b> that of a <i>siman</i> of which the <b>majority</b> was cut, and <b>this is what the Merciful One said to Moses: Do not leave the majority</b> uncut. When cutting precisely half, the majority does not remain uncut. <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> The halakhic status of a <i>siman</i> of which precisely <b>half</b> was cut and <b>half</b> remained uncut <b>is not like</b> that of a <i>siman</i> of which the <b>majority</b> was cut, and <b>this is what the Merciful One said to Moses: Cut the majority</b> of the <i>siman</i>. Therefore, cutting precisely half is insufficient.
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the proofs that it cites with regard to this dispute: <b>Half, Ketina, windpipe, deficiency.</b>
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If one cut <b>half of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>in a bird or one and a half</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>in an animal, his slaughter is not valid.</b> The Gemara questions the opinion of Rav: <b>If you say</b> that the halakhic status of a <i>siman</i> of which precisely <b>half</b> was cut and <b>half</b> remained uncut <b>is like</b> that of a <i>siman</i> of which the <b>majority</b> was cut, <b>why is</b> his slaughter <b>not valid?</b> By cutting half, <b>didn’t he perform</b> the cutting of <b>a majority</b> of the <i>siman</i>? The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>By rabbinic law,</b> the slaughter is not valid, due to the concern that <b>perhaps he will not come to perform</b> cutting on even <b>half</b> of the <i>siman</i>.
<b>Rav Ketina said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof contrary to Rav’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i> with regard to an impure earthenware vessel that is purified through being broken. If it is broken in two, the larger portion remains impure and the smaller portion is purified. If <b>he divided it into two and they are</b> seemingly <b>equal</b> halves, <b>both are impure, because it is impossible to measure precisely</b> in breaking an earthenware vessel and render both halves equal. Since it is impossible to determine which half is larger, both remain impure due to uncertainty.
The Gemara infers: <b>But were it possible to measure precisely</b> and divide it into equal halves, both would be <b>pure.</b> If, as Rav states, the halakhic status of half is like that of a majority, <b>why are they pure? Go here,</b> to one half of the vessel, and you will see that <b>there is a majority</b> and it should remain impure, and <b>go there,</b> to the other half, and you will see that <b>there is a majority</b> and it should remain impure.
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> in rejecting that proof: <b>There are not two majorities in one vessel.</b> Therefore, one cannot consider the halakhic status of half like that of a majority. By contrast, with regard to cutting the windpipe or gullet, the halakhic status of precisely half can be like that of a majority, as there is no other majority contradicting that status.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof contrary to Rav’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>cut half</b> the <b>windpipe and interrupted</b> the slaughter

Daf 29a

for an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of the <b>slaughter</b> of <b>another</b> animal, <b>and</b> then <b>completed</b> his slaughter, <b>his slaughter</b> is <b>valid. But if you say</b> the halakhic status of a <i>siman</i> of which precisely <b>half</b> was cut and <b>half</b> remained uncut <b>is like</b> that of the <b>majority,</b> then by cutting half the windpipe <b>he rendered it a <i>tereifa</i></b> because it is as though the majority of the windpipe is severed.
The Gemara answers: <b>Do you hold</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is referring to the slaughter <b>of an animal? No,</b> it is referring to the slaughter <b>of a bird,</b> which requires the cutting of only one <i>siman</i>. <b>Whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, the slaughter should be valid. <b>If</b> the halakhic status of a <i>siman</i> of which precisely <b>half</b> was cut and <b>half</b> remained uncut <b>is like</b> that of the <b>majority, he has performed</b> the cutting of <b>the majority</b> and the slaughter is valid. And <b>if</b> the halakhic status of a <i>siman</i> of which precisely <b>half</b> was cut and <b>half</b> remained uncut <b>is not like</b> that of the <b>majority,</b> then in cutting half the <i>siman</i> <b>he did not perform any</b> action that would render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof contrary to Rav’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>half of the windpipe was deficient</b> prior to the slaughter <b>and</b> the slaughterer <b>added to</b> that deficiency an incision of <b>any size, and completed it, his slaughter is valid. And if you say that</b> the halakhic status of a <i>siman</i> of which precisely <b>half</b> was cut and <b>half</b> remained uncut <b>is like</b> that of the <b>majority,</b> the animal <b>is a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> as half its windpipe was deficient before the slaughter.
<b>Rava said: The matter of <i>tereifa</i> is different, as we require a majority that is clearly visible.</b> If precisely half the windpipe is deficient it does not appear to be a majority. By contrast, with regard to slaughter, the status of half is like that of the majority.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>And is it not</b> derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference that <b>all the more so,</b> a conspicuous majority is required for slaughter? <b>And just as</b> with regard to <b><i>tereifa</i>, where</b> the animal <b>is rendered a <i>tereifa</i></b> by a deficiency <b>of any size,</b> e.g., by a minuscule perforation of the gullet, in cases <b>where we require a majority, we require a majority that is clearly visible,</b> with regard to <b>slaughter, where until there is a majority</b> of the <i>simanim</i> cut, the slaughter <b>is not valid, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear <b>that we require a majority that is clearly visible?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara revises its understanding of the dispute between Rav and Rav Kahana. <b>Everyone</b> agrees that the halakhic status of a <i>siman</i> of which precisely <b>half</b> was cut and <b>half</b> remained uncut <b>is not like</b> that of a <i>siman</i> of which the <b>majority</b> was cut. <b>And when</b> the dispute <b>of Rav and Rav Kahana was stated, it was stated with regard to</b> the <b>matter of the Paschal offering.</b> If a majority of the Jewish people were ritually impure on the fourteenth of Nisan, the Paschal offering is sacrificed that day and eaten in a state of impurity. If only a minority of the Jewish people were impure, the ritually pure majority brings the Paschal offering on the fourteenth of Nisan, and the impure minority brings the Paschal offering on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> one month later.
In a case where <b>the Jewish people were</b> equally divided on the fourteenth of Nisan, with <b>half</b> of them <b>pure and half</b> of them <b>impure, Rav said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> in the case where <b>half</b> the people were impure and <b>half</b> were pure <b>is like</b> that of a case where the <b>majority</b> was impure, and the entire people brings the Paschal offering in Nisan. <b>And Rav Kahana said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> in the case where <b>half</b> the people were impure and <b>half</b> were pure is <b>not like</b> that of a case where the <b>majority</b> was impure. Therefore, those who are pure bring the Paschal offering on the fourteenth of Nisan, and those who are impure bring the Paschal offering on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering, <b>what is the reason that Rav</b> accords half the people the status of a majority? It is <b>as it is written: “Any man who shall be impure by reason of a corpse…</b>shall observe the Passover to the Lord. On the fourteenth day of the second month at evening they shall observe it” (Numbers 9:10–11), from which it is derived: A ritually impure <b>person</b> is <b>deferred</b> to observe the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, <b>but</b> a ritually impure <b>congregation is not deferred</b> to observe the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>. The status of half the people is that of a congregation, not that of a collection of individuals.
§ The mishna teaches: If one cut <b>the majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>in a bird</b> or the majority of two <i>simanim</i> in an animal,his slaughter is valid. The Gemara asks: <b>We</b> already <b>learn</b> this on <b>another occasion,</b> in the first clause of the mishna: The halakhic status of <b>the majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>is like</b> that of the entire <i>siman</i>. Why is the redundancy necessary?
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the names of the <i>amora’im</i> who participate in the discussion that ensues: <b><i>Heh</i>,</b> Rav Hoshaya; <b><i>kaf</i>,</b> Rabbi Kahana; <b><i>shin</i>,</b> Rabbi Shimi; <b><i>peh</i>,</b> Rav Pappa; <b><i>shin</i>,</b> Rav Ashi; <b><i>ḥet</i>.</b>
<b>Rav Hoshaya said: One</b> mention of the equivalence between majority and whole is referring to slaughter <b>of non-sacred</b> birds and animals <b>and one</b> is referring to slaughter <b>of sacrificial</b> birds and animals. <b>And</b> it <b>is necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> to teach both cases, <b>as, if</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught us</b> only the case of slaughter of <b>non-sacred</b> birds and animals, one might think that it <b>is there that one suffices with the majority</b> of the <i>siman</i>, <b>because he does not require the blood;</b> he seeks merely to slaughter the animal. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>sacrificial</b> birds and animals, <b>where he requires the blood</b> for sprinkling on the altar, <b>say</b> that <b>it will not suffice for him</b> to cut <b>the majority,</b> and the slaughter is not valid <b>until there is</b> a cutting of <b>the entire</b> windpipe or gullet.
<b>And if</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught us</b> only the case of slaughter of <b>sacrificial</b> birds and animals, one might think that one must cut a majority of the <i>siman</i> <b>because he requires the blood</b> for sprinkling on the altar; but with regard to the slaughter of <b>non-sacred</b> birds and animals, <b>where he does not require the blood, say that</b> cutting <b>half</b> the <i>siman</i> <b>is sufficient,</b> and there is no need to cut a majority. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> the principle twice, once to teach that a majority suffices in the case of sacrificial animals, and once to teach that a majority is required in the case of non-sacred animals.
The Gemara asks <b>which</b> clause of the mishna is referring to cutting a majority of the <i>simanim</i> <b>in non-sacred</b> birds and animals, <b>and which</b> is referring to cutting a majority of the <i>simanim</i> <b>in sacrificial</b> birds and animals?
<b>Rav Kahana said: It stands to reason</b> that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is referring to the slaughter <b>of non-sacred</b> birds and animals <b>and the latter clause</b> is referring to the slaughter <b>of sacrificial</b> birds and animals. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> does Rav Kahana arrive at that conclusion? The Gemara answers: It is <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the first clause of the mishna <b>teaches: One who slaughters</b> by cutting one <i>siman</i> in a bird and two <i>simanim</i> in an animal. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the <b>first clause</b> is referring to the case <b>of sacrificial</b> birds and animals, the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> formulated it as: <b>One who pinches</b> the nape of the neck of a bird, as sacrificial birds are not slaughtered with a knife, but pinched with a fingernail.
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what</b> do you say? That the <b>latter clause</b> is referring to slaughter <b>of sacrificial</b> birds and animals? But the <i>tanna</i> teaches in the latter clause: If one cut the majority of one <i>siman</i> in a bird or the majority of two <i>simanim</i> in an animal, <b>his slaughter is valid.</b> If the reference is to sacrificial birds and animals, the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> formulated it: <b>His pinching is valid.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is <b>not difficult; since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>concluded</b> with mention of the slaughter <b>of an animal, he also taught: His slaughter is valid,</b> which is referring to the sacrificial animal. <b>But</b> in <b>the first clause, since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>stands to</b> begin with the case of <b>a bird, if it enters your mind</b> that the reference is <b>to sacrificial</b> birds, the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> formulated it: <b>One who pinches</b> the nape of the neck of the bird.
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said</b> that one arrives at the conclusion that <b>the first clause</b> is referring to slaughter <b>of non-sacred</b> birds and animals <b>from here: As</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches:</b> One who slaughters by cutting <b>one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>in a bird. And if it enters your mind</b> that the reference is to the slaughter <b>of sacrificial</b> birds, <b>isn’t there the bird burnt offering, which requires</b> that <b>two <i>simanim</i></b> be cut?
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what</b> do you say? That the <b>latter clause</b> is referring to slaughter <b>of sacrificial</b> birds and animals? But the <i>tanna</i> teaches in the latter clause: If one cut <b>the majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>in a bird</b> or the majority of two <i>simanim</i> in an animal, his slaughter is valid. If the reference is to sacrificial birds, <b>isn’t there the bird burnt offering, which requires</b> the pinching of <b>two <i>simanim</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>The majority of one</b> <i>siman</i>? It means <b>the majority of each and every one</b> of the two. <b>And by right</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have taught: The majority of two.</b> But <b>since there is the</b> bird <b>sin offering, which suffices with</b> the cutting of <b>one <i>siman</i>, due to that</b> reason the matter is <b>not clear-cut for him.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> formulated the <i>halakha</i> in a manner that could apply to one <i>siman</i>, i.e., in the case of a sin offering, and to two <i>simanim</i>, i.e., in the case of a burnt offering and of animal offerings.
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that one arrives at the conclusion that <b>the first clause</b> is referring to slaughter <b>of non-sacred</b> birds and animals <b>from here: As</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The slaughter is not valid <b>until he cuts the veins</b> in the neck. <b>And the Rabbis disagree with him,</b> and do not require that one cut the veins in the neck. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the reference is to the slaughter of <b>non-sacred</b> birds, it works out <b>well. But if you say</b> that the reference is to the slaughter of <b>sacrificial</b> birds, <b>why do the Rabbis disagree with him? He himself,</b> i.e., the one slaughtering, <b>requires the blood</b> in order to sprinkle it on the altar, which would warrant cutting the veins.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that one arrives at the conclusion that <b>the latter clause</b> is referring to slaughter <b>of sacrificial</b> birds and animals <b>from here: As</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> in the mishna (30b): <b>One who slaughters</b> by cutting <b>two</b> animals’ <b>heads simultaneously, his slaughter is valid.</b> The Gemara infers from the precise language of the mishna: <b>One who slaughters,</b> indicating that <b>after the fact, yes,</b> his slaughter is valid; but one may <b>not</b> slaughter two animals simultaneously <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b>
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that the reference is to <b>sacrificial</b> birds or animals, <b>this is</b> the reason that one may <b>not</b> slaughter two animals simultaneously <b><i>ab initio</i>:</b> It is <b>due to that which Rav Yosef teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And when you sacrifice a peace offering to the Lord, you shall sacrifice it [<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>] that you may be accepted” (Leviticus 19:5). The term “<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>” can be divided into two terms: You shall sacrifice [<i>tizbaḥ</i>] and it [<i>hu</i>]. From the term <b>“You shall sacrifice [<i>tizbaḥ</i>],”</b> it is derived <b>that there will not be two</b> people <b>slaughtering one offering.</b> From the full term <b>“You shall sacrifice it [<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>]”</b> it is derived <b>that one</b> person <b>may not slaughter two offerings</b> simultaneously.
<b>And Rav Kahana said,</b> to explain the derivation of the first <i>halakha</i> in the <i>baraita</i>: Although the term “<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>” is vocalized in the plural, leading to the conclusion that two people may slaughter an animal together, nevertheless, because the word is written without a <i>vav</i>, the term <b><i>tizbaḥehu</i> is written,</b> in the singular, indicating that two individuals may not slaughter the offering. <b>But if you say</b> that the reference is to the slaughter of <b>non-sacred</b> birds, it should be permitted <b>even <i>ab initio</i>.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, too, holds</b> that the <b>first clause</b> of the mishna is referring to the slaughter <b>of non-sacred</b> birds and animals <b>and</b> the <b>latter clause</b> is referring to the slaughter <b>of sacrificial</b> birds and animals, <b>as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Since we learned</b> in the mishna that the halakhic status of <b>the majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>is like</b> that of the entire <i>siman</i>, <b>why did we</b> also need to <b>learn</b> later in the mishna: <b>The majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>in a bird or the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>in an animal?</b> The latter clause is obvious based on the principle articulated in the first clause.
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish explains: <b>Since we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 31b): <b>They brought him</b> the sheep for <b>the daily</b> morning <b>offering,</b> and <b>he slaughtered it [<i>keratzo</i>]</b> by cutting most of the way through the gullet and the windpipe, <b>and a different</b> priest <b>completed</b> the <b>slaughter on his behalf</b> so that the High Priest could receive the blood in a vessel and proceed with the order of the Yom Kippur service, one <b>might</b> have thought that if the other priest <b>did not complete</b> the cutting of the two <i>simanim</i>, the slaughter <b>would not be valid. Therefore, we learned</b> in the mishna: If one cut <b>the majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>in a bird or the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>in an animal,</b> his slaughter is valid.
The Gemara analyzes the statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish. <b>The Master said:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that if the other priest <b>did not complete</b> the cutting of the two <i>simanim</i>, the slaughter <b>would not be valid.</b>

Daf 29b

How could that possibility enter one’s mind? <b>If</b> that is <b>so,</b> the completion of that slaughter <b>is</b> a Temple <b>service</b> performed <b>by another</b> on Yom Kippur. <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The entire Yom Kippur</b> Temple <b>service is valid only</b> if performed <b>by</b> the High Priest.
The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>is saying:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that if the slaughter was not completed by the other priest it <b>would be not valid by rabbinic law, as it</b> might <b>enter your mind to say that there is an invalidation by rabbinic law. Therefore, we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>The majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>in a bird or the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>in an animal.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And since there is not even an invalidation by rabbinic law, why do I</b> need the other priest <b>to complete</b> the cutting of the <i>simanim</i>? The Gemara answers: There is a <b>mitzva to complete</b> the slaughter <i>ab initio</i> to facilitate the free flow of the blood.
§ <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says in the name of Levi the Elder:</b> Halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>only at</b> its <b>conclusion. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>from the beginning to the end</b> of the act.
<b>Rava said</b> in establishing the parameters of the dispute between Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Everyone concedes</b> in a case <b>where a gentile slaughtered,</b> i.e., cut, <b>one <i>siman</i> and a Jew</b> slaughtered <b>one <i>siman</i>, that</b> the slaughter <b>is not valid</b> even if slaughter is accomplished only at its conclusion, as <b>an action</b> rendering the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i> was performed at the hand of a gentile.</b> Since slaughter by a gentile is not valid, the gentile renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>In</b> the case <b>of a bird burnt offering as well, where one <i>siman</i> was pinched</b> by a priest <b>below</b> the red line marking half the height of the altar, in accordance with the procedure of the sin offering, <b>and one <i>siman</i></b> was pinched <b>above</b> the red line, in accordance with the procedure of the burnt offering, the pinching is <b>not valid, as</b> the priest <b>performed an action</b> appropriate for <b>a bird sin offering below</b> the red line, disqualifying it from being sacrificed as a burnt offering.
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagree only</b> in a case <b>where</b> an individual <b>cut one <i>siman</i> outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and one <i>siman</i> inside</b> the Temple courtyard. <b>According to the one who says:</b> Halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>from the beginning to the end</b> of the act, i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, one who begins the slaughter outside the Temple courtyard <b>is liable</b> for slaughter of a sacrificial animal outside the courtyard. <b>According to the one who says:</b> Halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>only at</b> its <b>conclusion,</b> i.e., Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, one who does so <b>is not liable,</b> as the conclusion of the slaughter, which is the determining factor, is performed inside the Temple courtyard.
<b>Rabba bar Shimi said to</b> Rava: <b>The Master did not say</b> that <b>this</b> was the crux of the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish. <b>And who is</b> the Master? It is <b>Rav Yosef,</b> who says that in a case <b>where one cut one <i>siman</i> outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and one <i>siman</i> inside</b> the Temple courtyard, all agree that the slaughter is <b>not valid</b> and the priest is liable to receive punishment, <b>because</b> he <b>performed an action</b> appropriate for <b>a bird sin offering outside</b> the Temple courtyard.
<b>They disagree only</b> in a case <b>where one slaughtered the minority</b> of each <b>of the <i>simanim</i> outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and completed</b> the slaughter <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard. <b>According to the one who says:</b> Halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>from the beginning to the end</b> of the act, i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, one who begins the slaughter outside the Temple courtyard <b>is liable</b> for slaughter of a sacrificial animal outside the courtyard. <b>According to the one who says:</b> Halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>only at</b> its <b>conclusion,</b> i.e., Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, one who does so <b>is not liable,</b> as he concludes the slaughter in an appropriate place.
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Para</i> 4:4): <b>Anyone who is engaged in</b> any part of the rite of the red <b>heifer</b> continuously <b>from beginning to end transmits</b> ritual <b>impurity to</b> the <b>garments</b> that he is wearing. <b>And they disqualify</b> the red heifer for use in the rite if they perform any <b>other labor</b> while engaged in any part of the rite of the red heifer.
If <b>a disqualification befell</b> the heifer <b>during its slaughter,</b> with regard to all those engaged in the rite of the red heifer, <b>whether</b> they engaged in the rite <b>before</b> the heifer <b>was disqualified or after</b> the heifer <b>was disqualified,</b> the heifer <b>does not render garments</b> that they are wearing <b>impure.</b> Since its slaughter was not valid it is disqualified from being used as a red heifer and therefore does not impart impurity. If it became disqualified at the time <b>of sprinkling</b> the blood of the heifer toward the opening of the Temple, with regard to those who engaged in the rite of the red heifer <b>before it was disqualified,</b> the heifer <b>renders the garments</b> that they are wearing <b>impure.</b> By contrast, with regard to those who handled the animal <b>after it was disqualified,</b> the heifer <b>does not render</b> the <b>garments</b> that they are wearing <b>impure.</b>
Rabbi Zeira elaborates: <b>And if you say</b> that halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>from the beginning to the end</b> of the act, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>also distinguish</b> between disqualification at the beginning and at the end <b>of the slaughter:</b> If it <b>became disqualified during slaughter,</b> with regard to one who engaged in any part of the rite <b>before it became disqualified,</b> the heifer <b>renders garments</b> that he is wearing <b>impure,</b> and with regard to one who engaged in any part of the rite <b>after it became disqualified,</b> the heifer <b>does not render</b> the <b>garments</b> that he is wearing <b>impure.</b>
<b>Rava said: Are you saying</b> that the discussion concerns a case where the <b>slaughter was invalidated? There it is different, because the matter was revealed retroactively,</b> i.e., it was revealed <b>that it was not</b> a valid <b>slaughter at all.</b> Since at no stage of the slaughter was it valid, the heifer does not render the garments impure at all.
<b>Rava said: If</b> any aspect of that mishna is <b>difficult for me</b> it is <b>this</b> that is <b>difficult for me: According to the one who says:</b> Halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>only at</b> its <b>conclusion, let</b> the mishna <b>distinguish</b> between two individuals <b>in</b> the preparation <b>of a fit</b> red <b>heifer,</b> even when the heifer was not disqualified. Let the mishna teach a case <b>where they slaughtered it with two men, as the</b> heifer <b>does not render the first man</b> who slaughters <b>impure,</b> as the slaughter did not yet begin, <b>and the</b> heifer <b>renders the latter man impure.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef said: Are you saying</b> that the discussion concerns a case of <b>two men</b> slaughtering <b>one offering?</b> Raise difficulties <b>except for that, as we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And when you sacrifice a peace offering to the Lord, you shall sacrifice it [<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>] that you may be accepted” (Leviticus 19:5), that the term “<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>” can be divided into two terms: You shall sacrifice [<i>tizbaḥ</i>] and it [<i>hu</i>]. From the term <b>“You shall sacrifice [<i>tizbaḥ</i>],”</b> it is derived <b>that there will not be two</b> people <b>slaughtering one offering.</b> From the full term <b>“You shall offer it [<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>],”</b> it is derived <b>that one</b> person <b>may not slaughter two offerings</b> simultaneously.
<b>And Rav Kahana said,</b> to explain the derivation of the first <i>halakha</i> in the <i>baraita</i>: Although the term “<i>tizbaḥuhu</i>” is vocalized in the plural, leading to the conclusion that two people may slaughter an animal together, nevertheless, because the word is written without a <i>vav</i>, it emerges that the phrase <b>“You shall sacrifice it [<i>tizbaḥehu</i>],”</b> in the singular, <b>is written,</b> indicating that two individuals may not slaughter the offering.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i> that <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is the statement of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b>

Daf 30a

which is cited <b>unattributed,</b> i.e., it is one of his many opinions that are cited in the Mishna and <i>baraitot</i> without attribution. <b>But the Rabbis say: Two</b> people <b>may slaughter one offering.</b> According to the Rabbis, Rava’s difficulty remains: Let the mishna teach a case where they slaughtered it with two men, as the heifer does not render the first man who slaughters impure, as the slaughter did not yet begin, and the heifer renders the latter man impure.
<b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that two people may not slaughter one offering, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>also distinguish</b> and teach a case <b>where one man slaughtered with two cloths</b> on his head, starting the slaughter with one and replacing it with the other midway through the slaughter, <b>as</b> in that case, since halakhic slaughter is accomplished only at its conclusion, the <b>first cloth is not rendered impure but the latter cloth is rendered impure. Rather,</b> one must say that the <i>tanna</i> <b>is speaking</b> only <b>in</b> reference to cases involving the <b>disqualification of the</b> red <b>heifer</b> itself, but he <b>is not speaking in</b> reference to cases involving <b>a fit</b> red heifer, and no proof may be cited from here.
<b>Rav Idi bar Avin raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 63a) to the opinion that halakhic slaughter is accomplished only at its conclusion. If one slaughters an animal for the sake of the Paschal offering on the fourteenth of Nisan after noon while he has leaven in his possession, he is flogged for violating the prohibition: “You shall not slaughter the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread” (Exodus 23:18). If he slaughtered the animal not for the sake of the Paschal offering, he is exempt from receiving lashes. <b>And</b> if he slaughtered the animal <b>during the festival</b> of Passover <b>for</b> the <b>sake</b> of the Paschal offering with leaven in his possession, <b>he is exempt,</b> because it is a disqualified Paschal offering, as it was slaughtered beyond its appointed time. But if he slaughtered the animal during the Festival <b>not for</b> the <b>sake</b> of the Paschal offering, but rather as a peace offering, <b>he is liable</b> for slaughtering the animal with leaven in his possession.
<b>And we discussed</b> this matter: <b>The reason</b> he is liable is due to the fact <b>that</b> his intent was to slaughter it <b>not for the sake of</b> the Paschal offering, <b>but</b> had he slaughtered it with <b>unspecified</b> intent he would be <b>exempt,</b> because the offering would be disqualified. Unless he specifically intends otherwise, the animal retains its status as a Paschal offering and is disqualified when sacrificed beyond its appointed time.
The Gemara asks: <b>And why is he exempt?</b> Doesn’t <b>a Paschal offering</b> sacrificed <b>during the rest of the days of the year</b> assume the status of <b>a peace offering,</b> and doesn’t one who slaughters a peace offering during the time when it is prohibited to possess leaven with leaven in his possession also violate the prohibition? <b>Conclude from it</b> that <b>a Paschal offering</b> sacrificed <b>during the rest of the days of the year requires</b> explicit <b>revocation</b> of its status; otherwise, it does not assume the status of a peace offering and it remains a disqualified Paschal offering.
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Gamda said:</b> A response <b>emerged from the group</b> of scholars that discussed this matter, <b>and they said: What are we dealing with here?</b> It is <b>with</b> a case <b>where the owners</b> of the Paschal offering <b>were ritually impure</b> on the fourteenth of Nisan with impurity imparted <b>by a corpse</b>. In that case, the Torah commands (Numbers 9:10–11) <b>that</b> since they were unable to sacrifice the Paschal offering at the appointed time, the fourteenth of Nisan, they <b>were deferred to the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>,</b> the fourteenth of Iyyar. Since presumably the owner plans to use his Paschal offering on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>, its <b>unspecified</b> slaughter in the interim <b>stands</b> to be offered <b>for the sake of</b> the Paschal offering, <b>and it is that</b> Paschal offering <b>that requires revocation</b> of its status. <b>But other</b> situations of a Paschal offering that is slaughtered beyond its designated time <b>do not require revocation</b> of the animal’s status, and it assumes the status of a peace offering.
Returning to the matter at hand, if a Paschal offering that is designated for use on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i> is slaughtered on Passover while one has leaven in his possession, he is exempt from receiving lashes because it is a disqualified Paschal offering. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>from the beginning to the end</b> of the act, the offering is <b>disqualified from the beginning of the slaughter</b> as a Paschal offering slaughtered beyond its appointed time. Therefore, one is exempt from receiving lashes. <b>But if you say</b> that halakhic <b>slaughter is</b> accomplished <b>only at</b> its <b>conclusion,</b> why is one exempt if he slaughtered the animal with leaven in his possession? <b>Once he</b> began and <b>cut a bit</b> of the <i>siman</i>, <b>it is rejected from</b> its status as <b>a Paschal offering</b> and can no longer be offered on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>. Therefore, <b>when he slaughters the other,</b> remaining, portion of the <i>simanim</i> without specification, <b>it is a peace offering that he is slaughtering.</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Idi bar Avin: Even if you say that halakhic slaughter is accomplished only at its conclusion, <b>although it was rejected from</b> the possibility of being sacrificed on the second <b><i>Pesaḥ</i>, was it rejected from</b> the possibility of being redeemed and from the possibility of <b>the monetary value of a Paschal offering</b> being used to purchase an animal to be sacrificed on the second <i>Pesaḥ</i>? As long as the slaughter is not yet complete, redemption of the animal remains possible. Therefore, unspecified slaughter at that time is for the sake of a Paschal offering and one should be exempt from receiving lashes.
<b>And if you would say that</b> in order to redeem a consecrated item <b>one requires</b> that the animal be placed <b>standing</b> before the priest <b>and</b> it requires <b>valuation</b> (see Leviticus 27:11–12), and once it is slaughtered it is unable to stand, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>slaughtered,</b> i.e., cut, <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>in</b> the animal <b>or a majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>, <b>and</b> the animal <b>is still convulsing,</b> its halakhic status <b>is like a living</b> animal <b>in every respect,</b> and it may be redeemed until the convulsing ceases?
§ <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: One who cuts</b> a <i>siman</i> <b>in two or three places</b> on the neck, and together the cuts constitute the requisite measure of slaughter, <b>his slaughter is valid.</b> Rav Yehuda adds: <b>When I stated this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>before Shmuel he said to me: We require a clear</b> and obvious <b>slaughter and</b> in the case of cuts in two or three places <b>there is no</b> obvious slaughter.
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish also holds</b> that <b>we require a clear</b> and obvious <b>slaughter, as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that slaughter must be clear</b> and obvious? <b>As it is stated: “Their tongue is a sharpened [<i>shaḥut</i>] arrow, it speaks deceit;</b> one speaks peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he lays wait for him” (Jeremiah 9:7). Just as an arrow clearly enters one part of the body, so too, the slaughter [<i>sheḥita</i>] must be clear and obvious.
<b>Rabbi Elazar raises an objection</b> from a mishna (30b): If <b>two</b> people <b>are grasping a knife and slaughtering</b> one animal, <b>even</b> if each is holding a knife and slaughtering <b>one above and one below,</b> with each one slaughtering at a different point in the neck, their <b>slaughter is valid. But why</b> is the slaughter valid according to the opinions of Shmuel and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish? <b>There is no clear</b> and obvious <b>slaughter,</b> as each is cutting a different part of the neck.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>The mishna</b> is referring to a case <b>with one knife and two people,</b> each holding one end of the knife, resulting in a single diagonal incision from above to below.
<b>Rabbi Abba said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>If so, is this</b> what <b>is taught in that regard</b> in a <i>baraita</i> commenting <b>on</b> that mishna: One need <b>not be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps each</b> will <b>render</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> due <b>to the other? Granted, if you say</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>of two knives and two people</b> it works out <b>well, lest you say: Let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps each will rely on the other</b> that he will perform the slaughter properly, <b>and neither will this</b> one <b>come to execute</b> the cut on <b>the majority</b> of the <i>simanim</i>, <b>nor will that</b> one <b>come to execute</b> the cut on <b>the majority</b> of the <i>simanim</i>. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us that</b> one need <b>not be concerned.</b>
<b>But if you say</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>of one knife and two people, that</b> statement in the <i>baraita</i> should not have said: One need <b>not be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps each</b> will <b>render</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> due <b>to the other;</b> it <b>should have</b> said: One need not be concerned that because one is pulling in one direction and one is pulling in the other, <b>perhaps each will</b> cause <b>the other</b> to <b>press</b> the knife and thereby invalidate the slaughter.
<b>Rabbi Avin said to him: Teach:</b> One need <b>not be concerned</b>

Daf 30b

that <b>perhaps each will</b> cause <b>the other</b> to <b>press</b> the knife.
<b>Rabbi Avin raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one slaughtered,</b> i.e., cut, <b>the gullet below</b> on the neck <b>and the windpipe above</b> on the neck, <b>or</b> cut <b>the gullet above</b> on the neck <b>and the windpipe below</b> on the neck, <b>his slaughter is valid.</b> Based on this, Rabbi Avin asks: <b>Why</b> is the slaughter valid? <b>But</b> in that case <b>there is no clear</b> and obvious <b>slaughter.</b>
<b>He raises the objection and he resolves it.</b> This <i>baraita</i> is not referring to cuts on two places on the neck; rather, it is referring <b>to slaughter performed</b> on a diagonal, <b>like</b> the point <b>of a reed [<i>kekulmos</i>]</b> fashioned into a writing utensil. The slaughterer begins cutting from the top of one <i>siman</i> and cuts diagonally downward so that when he reaches the second <i>siman</i>, the knife is lower down.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain bull that was slaughtered</b> with cuts <b>in two or three places</b> in the <i>simanim</i> on its neck. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta entered</b> the store <b>and took</b> a cut of meat <b>from the highest quality</b> parts of the animal, thereby demonstrating that the slaughter was valid. <b>Rabbi Zeira said to him: Our rabbi, you have taught us</b> through your actions that <b>the mishna:</b> If two people are grasping a knife and slaughtering one animal, even one above and one below, is referring even to a case <b>of two knives and two people</b> who are each cutting the <i>simanim</i> at a different part of the neck with their knives.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>one concealed the knife</b> in the neck <b>between</b> one <b><i>siman</i> and</b> the other <b><i>siman</i>,</b> i.e., he inserted the knife between the windpipe and the gullet, <b>and he severed</b> the gullet first and then removed the knife and cut the windpipe, the slaughter is <b>not valid.</b> If one concealed the knife <b>beneath the hide</b> of the neck and then he cut both <i>simanim</i>, the slaughter is <b>valid.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> explicitly in a mishna (32a): <b>Or</b> if one cut one <i>siman</i> and <b>concealed the knife beneath the second</b> <i>siman</i> <b>and severed it, Rabbi Yeshevav says:</b> The animal is <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> and imparts ritual impurity through contact with it and carrying it. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> and although eating it is prohibited, it does not transmit ritual impurity. Both agree that the slaughter is not valid in the sense that it does not permit the consumption of the meat of the animal.
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> is learned <b>from the mishna</b> alone, <b>I would say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies only in a case where one conceals the knife beneath the gullet and cuts it <b>from below to above,</b> i.e., from the nape to the front of the neck, <b>because he did not perform</b> the slaughter <b>in the</b> standard <b>manner of slaughter. But</b> if he cut the gullet <b>from above to below,</b> i.e., from the front of the neck to the nape, <b>since he performed</b> the slaughter <b>in the</b> standard <b>manner of slaughter, say</b> that the slaughter is <b>valid.</b> Therefore, Rav <b>teaches us</b> that with regard to any case where one conceals the knife during slaughter, his slaughter is not valid.
The Gemara proceeds to analyze the second part of that which Rav Yehuda says that Rav says: If one concealed the knife <b>beneath the hide</b> of the neck and then he cut both <i>simanim</i> in the standard manner the slaughter is <b>valid. The school of Rav say</b> that Rav says that in a case where one conceals the knife <b>beneath the hide</b> and cuts the <i>simanim</i> of the animal, <b>I do not know</b> whether the slaughter is valid, or whether it is not valid because he concealed the knife during the slaughter.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>the school of Rav, who say: Beneath the hide, I do not know,</b> if one concealed the knife <b>beneath a cloth</b> that is around the animal’s neck, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If one concealed the knife <b>beneath tangled wool</b> on the neck of a sheep, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara concludes: These dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>concealed</b> the knife <b>in</b> cutting <b>the minority of the <i>simanim</i></b> and cut the majority of the <i>simanim</i> in the standard manner, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> by cutting <b>two</b> animals’ <b>heads simultaneously, his slaughter is valid.</b> If <b>two</b> people <b>are grasping a knife and slaughtering</b> one animal, <b>even</b> if each is holding a knife and slaughtering <b>one above and one below,</b> with each one slaughtering at a different point in the neck, their <b>slaughter is valid.</b> If <b>one decapitated</b> the animal <b>in one</b> motion and did not slaughter the animal in the standard manner of drawing the knife back and forth, the slaughter is <b>not valid.</b> In a case where <b>one was</b> in the process of <b>slaughtering</b> the animal in the standard manner <b>and he decapitated</b> the animal <b>in one</b> motion, <b>if</b> the length <b>of the knife</b> is equivalent to <b>the</b> breadth of the animal’s <b>entire neck,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid.</b>
If <b>one was</b> in the process of <b>slaughtering</b> two animals simultaneously, <b>and he decapitated two heads in one</b> motion, <b>if</b> the length <b>of the knife</b> is equivalent to <b>the breadth of an entire neck</b> of <b>one</b> of the animals, the slaughter is <b>valid. In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that one must be concerned about the length of the knife, <b>said?</b> It is <b>when one drew</b> the knife <b>back and did not draw</b> it <b>forth, or drew it forth and did not draw it back; but</b> if <b>he drew it back and forth, even</b> if the knife was of <b>any length, even</b> if he slaughtered <b>with a scalpel [<i>be’izemel</i>],</b> the slaughter is <b>valid.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna stated: If one decapitated the animal in one motion, the slaughter is not valid. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Shmuel said:</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “Their tongue is a sharpened [<i>shaḥut</i>] arrow, it speaks deceit”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7). Just as an arrow is propelled by drawing back the bowstring, so too, slaughter [<i>sheḥita</i>] must be performed by drawing the knife across the animal’s neck and not by pressing the knife or striking the neck with the knife.
Likewise, <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And he shall slaughter [<i>veshaḥat</i>]</b> the young bull before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:5). The term <b>“<i>veshaḥat</i>”</b> means <b>nothing other than: And he shall draw</b> the knife across the neck of the animal. <b>And similarly,</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “And King Solomon made two hundred targets <b>of drawn [<i>shaḥut</i>] gold”</b> (I Kings 10:16), meaning gold that is smoothed in the manner of goldsmiths. <b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “Their tongue is a sharpened arrow, it speaks deceit”</b> (Jeremiah 9:7).
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the purpose of citing the additional verse introduced with the term: <b>And</b> the verse <b>states?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say</b> that the term <b>“drawn [<i>shaḥut</i>] gold”</b> means that the gold <b>was spun like</b> soft <b>thread [<i>keḥut</i>], come</b> and <b>hear: “Their tongue is a sharpened [<i>shaḥut</i>] arrow.”</b> In this verse, <i>shaḥut</i> means drawn like the bowstring that propels an arrow, and is not a reference to thread.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rava would examine the arrow for Rabbi Yona bar Taḥlifa</b> to ensure that there were no notches in it. <b>And</b> Rava shot the arrow and <b>slaughtered a bird with it as it was flying.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>And perhaps</b> when the arrow cut the bird’s neck <b>it performed</b> an inverted slaughter, with the arrow <b>concealed</b> in the neck, and cut the <i>simanim</i> from back to front. The Gemara responds: <b>We see</b>

Daf 31a

<b>that the feathers</b> at the front of the neck were <b>unraveled</b> by the arrow, a clear indication that slaughter was performed from the front of the neck.
The Gemara notes another difficulty encountered in the slaughter of a flying bird with an arrow. <b>But doesn’t</b> the bird’s blood <b>require covering</b> with earth? <b>And if you would say that</b> Rabbi Yona bar Taḥlifa <b>covers</b> the blood, <b>but doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In fulfilling the mitzva of covering the blood, <b>one who slaughters</b> an undomesticated animal or bird <b>must place earth beneath</b> the blood <b>and earth above</b> it, <b>as it is stated:</b> “He shall spill its blood, <b>and cover it in earth”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). <b>It is not stated:</b> Cover it with <b>earth, but rather “in earth</b>.” This <b>teaches that one who slaughters must place earth beneath</b> the blood <b>and earth above</b> the blood, so that the blood will be within the earth.
The Gemara answers <b>that</b> Rabbi Yona bar Taḥlifa would <b>designate for himself</b> the <b>earth of the entire valley [<i>patka</i>]</b> before shooting the arrow. That earth would serve as the layer of earth beneath the blood and he would proceed to cover the blood with another layer of earth.
§ The mishna teaches: In a case where <b>one was</b> in the process of <b>slaughtering</b> the animal in the standard manner <b>and he decapitated</b> the animal in one motion, if the length of the knife is equivalent to the breadth of the animal’s entire neck, the slaughter is valid. <b>Rabbi Zeira says:</b> The knife must be equivalent to <b>the</b> breadth of the animal’s <b>entire neck and</b> extend <b>beyond the neck.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Did Rabbi Zeira mean: Equivalent to the breadth of the animal’s <b>entire neck and</b> extend <b>beyond the neck</b> by an amount equivalent to the breadth of the <b>entire neck,</b> in which case the length of the knife <b>would</b> equal the breadth of <b>two necks? Or perhaps</b> he meant: Equivalent to the breadth of the <b>entire neck and beyond the neck</b> by <b>any amount?</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof to resolve the dilemma from the continuation of the mishna: If <b>one was</b> in the process of <b>slaughtering</b> two animals simultaneously, <b>and he decapitated two heads in one</b> motion, <b>if</b> the length <b>of the knife</b> is equivalent to the breadth of <b>an entire neck</b> of <b>one</b> of the animals the slaughter is <b>valid.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: The breadth of <b>an entire neck</b> of <b>one</b> of the animals? <b>If we say</b> that it means the breadth of <b>one entire neck and nothing more,</b> that is difficult. <b>Now,</b> for the slaughter <b>of one animal, we require</b> that the knife be equivalent to the breadth of the animal’s <b>entire neck and</b> extend <b>beyond the neck;</b> for the slaughter <b>of two animals,</b> is it possible that a knife whose length is equivalent to the breadth of <b>one</b> animal’s <b>entire neck would be sufficient? Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that it means that the length of the knife must be equivalent to the breadth of <b>one entire neck beyond the</b> breadth of <b>two necks.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Learn from</b> the mishna that Rabbi Zeira means that the length of the knife must be equivalent to the breadth of the animal’s entire neck and extend <b>beyond the neck</b> by the breadth of the <b>entire neck.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that this was Rabbi Zeira’s intent.
§ The mishna continues: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is <b>when one drew</b> the knife <b>back and did not draw</b> it <b>forth,</b> or drew it forth and did not draw it back. But if he drew it back and forth, even if the knife was of any length, even if he slaughtered with a scalpel, the slaughter is valid. <b>Rav Menashe said:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>in</b> the case of <b>a scalpel that does not have protrusions</b> from the sides. If there are protrusions, since the scalpel is short, there is concern that the corners may perforate the <i>simanim</i> or enter between the <i>simanim</i> and invalidate the slaughter.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Menashe: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to slaughter with <b>a needle?</b> Rav Menashe <b>said to him: A needle pierces</b> the <i>simanim</i>, as it perforates the neck instead of cutting it.
Rav Aḥa then asked Rav Menashe: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to slaughtering with <b>a cobbler’s needle,</b> which is flat and has sharp sides? Rav Menashe <b>said to him: We</b> already <b>learn</b> in the mishna: <b>Even</b> if the knife was of <b>any length,</b> the slaughter is valid. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to slaughter with <b>a cobbler’s needle?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>No.</b> The reference is to slaughtering with <b>a scalpel,</b> which is larger than a cobbler’s needle. The Gemara objects: The <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the case of <b>a scalpel explicitly</b> in the mishna. Therefore, the phrase in the mishna: A knife of any length, must be referring to an item smaller than a scalpel. The Gemara explains: The subsequent mention of the scalpel <b>is explaining</b> the phrase: Even if the knife was of any length. <b>What is</b> the knife of <b>any length</b> with which slaughter is valid? It is <b>a scalpel.</b>
<b>This too stands to reason, as, if it enters your mind</b> that the phrase: A knife of any length, is referring to <b>a cobbler’s needle, now</b> that it is <b>permitted</b> to slaughter with <b>a cobbler’s needle, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> to teach that it is permitted to slaughter with <b>a scalpel,</b> which is larger than a cobbler’s needle? The Gemara rejects that reasoning: It <b>is necessary</b> for the mishna to teach both the case of a cobbler’s needle and the case of <b>a scalpel,</b> as it could <b>enter your mind to say</b> that it is prohibited to slaughter with a scalpel even though it is permitted to slaughter with a cobbler’s needle. The reasoning for this distinction would be: <b>Let</b> the Sages <b>issue a decree</b> prohibiting the use of <b>a scalpel with no protrusions due to</b> the prohibition against using <b>a scalpel with protrusions.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that there is no decree and it is permitted to slaughter with a scalpel that has no protrusions.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a knife fell and slaughtered</b> an animal, <b>although</b> the knife <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>in the standard manner,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid, as it is stated: “And you shall slaughter…and you shall eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:7), from which it is derived: <b>That which you slaughter you may eat,</b> and that which was slaughtered on its own, you may not eat.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if a knife fell and slaughtered an animal the slaughter is not valid. The Gemara notes: <b>The reason</b> the slaughter is not valid is <b>that</b> the knife <b>fell. But</b> by inference, if <b>one dropped</b> the knife the slaughter is <b>valid, and</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though</b> when dropping the knife he <b>did not intend</b> to slaughter the animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who holds <b>that we do not require intent for slaughter? Rava said:</b> It <b>is Rabbi Natan, as Oshaya, the youngest of the company</b> of Sages, <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one threw a knife to embed it in the wall and</b> in the course of its flight the knife <b>went and slaughtered</b> an animal <b>in its</b> proper <b>manner, Rabbi Natan deems</b> the slaughter <b>valid and the Rabbis deem</b> the slaughter <b>not valid.</b> Oshaya <b>teaches</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>and he says</b> about <b>it:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan</b> that there is no need for intent to perform a valid act of slaughter.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rava</b> already <b>say it one time</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Natan? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (2a): <b>And</b> with regard to <b>any of them,</b> a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, <b>who slaughtered</b> an animal <b>and others see</b> and supervise <b>them, their slaughter is valid</b> even though they are incapable of intent. <b>And we said: Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who holds <b>that we do not require intent for slaughter? And Rava said:</b> It <b>is Rabbi Natan.</b>
The Gemara answers: Both statements <b>are necessary. As had</b> Rava <b>taught us</b> his statement <b>there</b> with regard to a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, one would have thought that the slaughter is valid <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> although the individual lacks intent to slaughter the animal, <b>he intends</b> his action <b>for the sake of cutting in general. But here,</b> with regard to throwing a knife at the wall, <b>where he does not intend</b> to cut at all, <b>say no,</b> the slaughter is not valid.
<b>And had</b> Rava <b>taught us</b> his statement <b>here</b> with regard to throwing the knife, one would have thought that the slaughter is valid is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> it <b>comes due to</b> the action <b>of a mentally competent person. But there,</b> with regard to slaughter by a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, <b>where</b> the slaughter <b>does not come due to</b> the action <b>of a mentally competent person, say</b> that the slaughter is <b>not</b> valid. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for Rava to teach both cases.
§ The mishna is now cited as proof in an amoraic dispute. <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>a menstruating woman who,</b> after the menstrual flow ended, <b>was compelled</b> against her will <b>and immersed</b> in a ritual bath, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: She is ritually pure vis-à-vis her house,</b> i.e., it is permitted for her to engage in intercourse with her husband, <b>but it is prohibited for her to partake of <i>teruma</i></b> because the immersion is not considered valid for that purpose. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: She was not purified even vis-à-vis her house.</b>
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who says</b> that <b>she is ritually pure vis-à-vis her house but it is prohibited for her to partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> it is difficult. With regard to <b>a transgression</b> punishable <b>by <i>karet</i>,</b> i.e., intercourse with a menstruating woman, <b>she was rendered permitted</b> by immersion against her will; with regard to partaking of <i>teruma</i>, <b>a prohibition</b> punishable by <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, which is a lesser punishment, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that it is permitted for her through immersion against her will? Why then does Rav deem it prohibited for her to partake of <i>teruma</i>?
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> The halakhic status of <b>her husband is non-sacred, and non-sacred</b> items <b>do not require intent</b> for purification. <b>And from where do you say</b> so? It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 5:6): In the case of <b>a wave that was detached</b> from the sea, <b>and in it</b> were <b>forty <i>se’a</i></b> of water, <b>and</b> that wave <b>fell on</b> an impure <b>person or on</b> impure <b>vessels, they are ritually pure. What, is it not</b> that <b>a person</b> is <b>similar to vessels? Just as vessels do not intend</b> to be purified and they are purified by the wave, <b>so too, a person does not require intent</b> in order to be purified.
The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>From where</b> is there proof that this is the meaning of the mishna? <b>Perhaps we are dealing with</b> the case of one who <b>sits</b> near the water <b>and waits</b> to determine <b>when the wave will be detached,</b> which is tantamount to having intent to immerse,

Daf 31b

<b>and vessels</b> are <b>similar to a person: Just as</b> for <b>a person, we require</b> his <b>intent</b> for purification, <b>so too</b> for <b>vessels,</b> they are purified only in a case <b>where a person intends for them</b> to be purified.
<b>And if you would say:</b> If the mishna is referring <b>to</b> the case of one who <b>sits and waits</b> to determine when the wave will be detached, <b>what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this <i>halakha</i>? It is obvious and introduces no novel element.
The Gemara responds that there is a novel element in this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Lest you say: Let us issue a decree</b> that a detached wave does not effect purification <b>due to</b> the concern that otherwise, one would receive the mistaken impression that one is purified in <b>a cascade [<i>ḥardalit</i>] of rainwater</b> containing forty <i>se’a</i>. The <i>halakha</i> is that rainwater purifies only when pooled in one place. <b>Alternatively, let us issue a decree</b> that <b>the edges</b> of the waves, which are in contact with the ground, are ineffective in purifying people and vessels standing on the ground <b>due to</b> the concern that otherwise one would receive the mistaken impression that vessels are purified even if one pushes them upward into the <b>arc</b> of the waves while the water remains airborne. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us that we do not issue</b> either of those <b>decrees.</b>
<b>And from where do you say that we do not immerse in the arcs</b> of waves? <b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may immerse in the edges</b> of waves, <b>but one may not immerse in</b> their <b>arcs, as one may not immerse in air.</b> Immersion may be performed only on the ground.
The Gemara again asks: <b>But in any event, from where do we</b> derive <b>that non-sacred</b> items <b>do not require intent?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 4:7): Produce becomes susceptible to ritual impurity only if it is dampened by one of seven liquids and its owner was amenable to its dampening. This is derived from the verse: “But when water is placed on the seed, and some of their carcass shall fall on it, it is impure to you” (Leviticus 11:38). If <b>produce fell into a stream, and one whose hands were ritually impure extended</b> his hands <b>and took</b> the produce from the water channel, <b>his hands are ritually pure</b> through immersion in the stream, <b>and</b> this <b>produce is not in</b> the category of: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed.”</b> The produce is not susceptible to ritual impurity because the owner did not intend that his hands become wet.
<b>But if</b> he placed his hands into the stream <b>so that</b> his hands <b>would be rinsed</b> and purified, <b>his hands are ritually pure, and the produce is in</b> the category of: “But <b>when</b> water <b>is placed.”</b> Since he was amenable to the dampening of his hands, the water on his hands renders the produce susceptible to ritual impurity. From the first case in the mishna it is clear that his hands are purified even though his intent was not to immerse them in the water.
<b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from a mishna (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 18b): If <b>one immersed for</b> the purpose of eating <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>and assumed the presumptive status</b> of ritual purity <b>for non-sacred</b> food, it <b>is prohibited</b> for him to partake of second-<b>tithe</b> produce. The Gemara infers: If <b>one assumed the presumptive status</b> of ritual purity with regard to non-sacred food, <b>yes,</b> it is permitted for him to eat non-sacred food; <b>if he did not assume the presumptive status,</b> he may <b>not</b> eat non-sacred food. This indicates that even when immersing in order to partake of non-sacred food, one must intend to assume the presumptive status of ritual purity.
Rav Naḥman rejects the proof from the mishna and says that no intent is required to assume the presumptive status of ritual purity in order to eat non-sacred food. Rather, <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Although he assumes the presumptive status</b> of ritual purity <b>for non-sacred</b> food, it <b>is prohibited</b> for him to partake of second-<b>tithe</b> produce.
Rava <b>raised an objection to</b> Rav Naḥman from that same mishna: If <b>one immersed without</b> intent to <b>assume the presumptive status</b> of ritual purity, it is <b>as though he did not immerse. What, is</b> the meaning of the mishna <b>not</b> that it is <b>as though he did not immerse at all?</b>
Rav Naḥman rejects that proof as well. <b>No,</b> it means that if he immersed without intent it is <b>as though he did not immerse to</b> partake of second-<b>tithe</b> produce, <b>but</b> in that case, <b>he immersed for non-sacred</b> food, for which no intent is necessary. The Gemara comments: Rava <b>believed</b> that Rav Naḥman <b>was</b> merely <b>putting him off</b> with his claim that the formulation of the mishna does not conclusively support his objection; he believed that Rav Naḥman was not stating the real meaning of the mishna. Rava then <b>went out, examined</b> the sources, <b>and discovered that it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> explicitly in accordance with the opinion of Rav Naḥman: If one <b>immersed and</b> had <b>no</b> intent to <b>assume the presumptive status</b> of ritual purity, it <b>is permitted</b> for him <b>to</b> eat <b>non-sacred</b> food, <b>but</b> it <b>is prohibited</b> for him <b>to</b> partake of second-<b>tithe</b> produce.
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Let us say that</b> there <b>will be a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan from this</b> <i>baraita</i>. This <i>baraita</i> states that immersion without intent is effective for non-sacred items, while Rabbi Yoḥanan said (31a) that if a woman who is impure due to menstruation immerses without intent she is forbidden to her husband, who is non-sacred.
Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> Indeed, the <i>baraita</i> is contrary to his opinion, but <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan is saying</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse dealing with the purification of a leprous garment, which must be laundered, quarantined for a week, and then immersed in a ritual bath: “And the garment…that you shall wash and the leprosy departed from them, and it shall be washed a second time and shall be pure” (Leviticus 13:58). <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef says:</b> It would have been sufficient for the verse to simply state: <b>And it shall be washed</b> and shall be pure. For <b>what</b> purpose does <b>the verse state: “A second time”?</b> The Torah <b>juxtaposes the second washing,</b> the immersion, <b>with the first washing,</b> the laundering. <b>Just as the first washing is</b> performed <b>with intent,</b> as it is written: “And the priest shall command that they wash the garment that has the leprous mark, and he shall quarantine it seven days more” (Leviticus 13:54), <b>so too, the second washing,</b> the immersion in a ritual bath, must be performed <b>with intent.</b>
<b>If</b> so, based on the same juxtaposition, perhaps derive: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the first washing, <b>we require the intent of a priest,</b> who commands to wash the garment, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the second washing, <b>we require the intent of a priest.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 13:58), indicating that there is purity <b>in any case</b> where there is intent, even without a command from a priest. In the opinion of Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef, even the immersion of the non-sacred garment must be performed with intent. Rav Yosef states that Rabbi Yoḥanan bases his statement on Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef’s opinion.
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi objects to</b> the association of the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan with the opinion of Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef: <b>Did Rabbi Yoḥanan say that</b> immersion of a non-sacred garment requires intent? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with an unattributed mishna?</b>
<b>And we learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>a knife fell and slaughtered</b> an animal, <b>although</b> the knife <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>in the standard manner,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid. And we discussed it: The reason</b> the slaughter is not valid is <b>that</b> the knife <b>fell. But</b> by inference, if <b>one dropped</b> the knife the slaughter is <b>valid, and</b> that is the ruling <b>even though</b> when dropping the knife he <b>did not intend</b> to slaughter the animal. <b>And we say: Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who holds <b>that we do not require intent for slaughter? Rava said:</b> It <b>is Rabbi Natan.</b> Based on his principle that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with an unattributed mishna, Rabbi Yoḥanan should rule in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Natan cited in the unattributed mishna, and not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef.
The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to slaughter, even Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef</b> concedes that intent is not necessary. He learns this <b>from the fact that the Merciful One revealed</b> that if <b>one acts unawares</b> in performing the slaughter <b>of sacrificial</b> animals, with no intent to slaughter, the offering <b>is disqualified.</b> This is derived (13a) from the verse: “You shall slaughter it to your will” (Leviticus 19:5). <b>By inference,</b> conclude that with regard to the slaughter <b>of non-sacred</b> animals <b>we do not require intent.</b>
While on this subject the Gemara clarifies: <b>And the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Natan and hold that slaughter of non-sacred animals requires intent would say: <b>Although we do not require intent to slaughter</b> non-sacred animals, <b>we require</b> intent <b>to cut</b> the neck of the animal. Throwing the knife down is not sufficient.
<b>Rava said</b> that it was <b>with this</b> contention that <b>Rabbi Natan overcame the Rabbis:</b> He said: <b>Is it written</b> with regard to the slaughter of non-sacred animals: <b>And you shall cut?</b> It <b>is written: “And you shall slaughter”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21). The Torah does not distinguish between cutting and slaughtering; <b>if we require intent for cutting, we</b> should <b>require</b> intent <b>even for slaughtering.</b> Conversely, <b>if we do not require intent for slaughtering, we should also not require</b> intent <b>for cutting.</b>
The Gemara revisits the matter of immersion without intent. <b>What are the circumstances of a menstruating woman who,</b> after the menstrual flow ended, <b>was compelled</b> against her will <b>and immersed</b> in a ritual bath? <b>If we say that another</b> woman <b>compelled her and immersed her</b> in a ritual bath, the immersion should be valid even according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as <b>the intent of another</b> woman <b>is full-fledged intent.</b>
<b>And furthermore,</b> in that case the immersion enables her to <b>partake of <i>teruma</i> as well, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 13b): In the case of a woman who is <b>a deaf-mute, or an imbecile, or blind, or who went insane,</b> and is therefore unable to examine herself reliably, <b>if</b> one of these women <b>has a competent</b> friend, that friend <b>prepares her</b> by examining her and immersing them in a ritual bath. And on that basis the incompetent woman <b>may partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said: According to Rabbi Natan,</b> who does not require intent for the slaughter of non-sacred animals, immersion against her will that renders it permitted for a woman to engage in intercourse with her husband is in a case <b>where she fell from a bridge</b> into a river, with no intent at all. <b>According to the Rabbis,</b> who require intent to cut for slaughter to be valid and intent to enter the water for immersion to be valid, it is referring to a case <b>where she descended</b> into the water <b>to cool</b> herself, with no thought of purification.
The Gemara continues its discussion of the dispute between Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis. <b>Rava said:</b> If one <b>slaughtered</b> a red <b>heifer and</b> in the same action <b>slaughtered another animal</b> together <b>with it, everyone agrees</b> that the red heifer is <b>disqualified.</b>

Daf 32a

But if <b>another animal was</b> inadvertently <b>slaughtered</b> together <b>with</b> the red heifer in the same action, <b>according to Rabbi Natan,</b> who holds that the slaughter of non-sacred animals without intent is valid, the red <b>heifer is disqualified,</b> because an additional labor was performed with its slaughter, and the other <b>animal is fit</b> for consumption, as its slaughter was valid. <b>According to the Rabbis,</b> who hold that slaughter of non-sacred animals without intent is not considered slaughter, the red <b>heifer is fit</b> for use in the purification rite because no other labor was performed with its slaughter, and <b>the</b> other <b>animal is unfit</b> for consumption.
The Gemara asks: That is <b>obvious;</b> why did Rava have to teach that? The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary for</b> Rava to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan</b> in the case where <b>another animal was</b> inadvertently <b>slaughtered</b> in the same action with the red heifer. It may <b>enter your mind to say: The Merciful One states</b> with regard to the slaughter of the red heifer: “And you shall give it to Elazar the priest…<b>and he shall slaughter it</b> before him” (Numbers 19:3), from which it is inferred: One may slaughter it, <b>but not it and another</b> animal simultaneously. <b>And what are the circumstances</b> of that prohibition? It is a case <b>where one slaughtered two</b> red <b>heifers at the same time. But</b> in a case where one slaughtered a red heifer together with <b>a non-sacred animal, say no,</b> that it does <b>not</b> disqualify the red heifer. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that even slaughter with a non-sacred animal disqualifies the red heifer.
Rava adds: If one slaughtered a red heifer and in the same action <b>cut a gourd</b> together <b>with it, everyone agrees</b> that the red heifer <b>is disqualified.</b> If one slaughtered a red heifer and <b>a gourd was</b> inadvertently <b>cut</b> together <b>with it</b> in the same action, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the red heifer is <b>fit</b> for use in the purification rite, as that is not labor that disqualifies a red heifer and it is also not excluded by the derivation from the verse “And he shall slaughter it.”
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If, when one was in the middle of slaughtering an animal, <b>the knife fell and he lifted it</b> and then completed the slaughter, or if <b>his garments fell and he lifted them</b> and then completed the slaughter, or if <b>he had honed the knife and grew weary</b> before completing the slaughter and <b>another came and slaughtered</b> the animal, <b>if he interrupted</b> the slaughter in one of these ways or in a different way for an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of an act of <b>slaughter,</b> the slaughter is <b>not valid. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The slaughter is not valid <b>if he interrupted</b> the slaughter for an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of <b>an examination.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of an act of <b>slaughter? Rav said:</b> It means an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of an act of <b>slaughter of another animal,</b> not the duration required to complete the act of slaughter that was interrupted.
<b>Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav:</b> Is the interruption that invalidates the slaughter an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of an act of <b>slaughter of</b> another <b>animal for an animal,</b> i.e., in a case where an animal was being slaughtered, <b>and</b> an interval equivalent to the duration of an act of slaughter <b>of</b> another <b>bird for a bird? Or perhaps</b> it is an interval equivalent to the duration of an act of slaughter <b>of an animal even for a bird,</b> and if the interruption is any shorter it does not invalidate the slaughter?
Rav <b>said to them:</b> When we studied this topic <b>I</b> did <b>not</b> feel sufficiently <b>intimate with my beloved</b> uncle, Rabbi Ḥiyya, such <b>that I</b> could <b>ask him</b> that question. Rav was able only to transmit that which he heard from Rabbi Ḥiyya, but was unable to resolve their dilemma.
<b>It was stated</b> that there is an amoraic dispute with regard to this matter. <b>Rav said:</b> An interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of an act of <b>slaughter of</b> another <b>animal for an animal, and</b> an interval equivalent to the duration of an act of slaughter <b>of</b> another <b>bird for a bird. And Shmuel said:</b> An interval equivalent to the duration of an act of slaughter <b>of an animal even for a bird. And likewise, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> An interval equivalent to the duration of an act of slaughter <b>of an animal even for a bird.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥananya said:</b> An interval <b>equivalent</b> to the period in <b>which one can bring another animal and slaughter</b> it. The Gemara asks: Does that mean the time in which <b>one can bring</b> an animal <b>even from anywhere else,</b> regardless of the distance? Occasionally, there is no animal available in close proximity. If so, <b>you have rendered your statement</b> subject <b>to circumstances;</b> it does not apply uniformly to all cases.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The practical difference <b>between</b> the opinion of Rabbi Ḥananya and that of the other Sages is in a case where there is an animal <b>standing</b> before the slaughterer and it is necessary <b>to cast</b> it to the ground in order to slaughter it. Even Rabbi Ḥananya disregards the time required to bring the animal from elsewhere. But Rabbi Ḥananya holds that the slaughter is invalidated only if the interruption lasts an interval equivalent to the duration of the act of casting the animal to the ground and slaughtering it. The Rabbis invalidate the slaughter even if an interval has elapsed that is equivalent to the duration of the act of slaughtering the animal, without casting it to the ground.
The Gemara cites an additional opinion with regard to the duration of the interruption that invalidates slaughter. <b>They said in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina:</b> The duration of the interruption that invalidates slaughter is <b>equivalent</b> to the period in <b>which he can lift</b> the animal from the ground <b>and</b> then <b>lay it</b> back on the ground <b>and slaughter</b> it. The interval is calculated based on the size of the animal in question. The duration of the interruption that invalidates slaughter of <b>a small</b> animal is equivalent to the period necessary <b>to</b> lift, lay down, and slaughter <b>a small</b> animal. <b>And</b> the duration of the interruption that invalidates slaughter of <b>a large</b> animal is equivalent to the period necessary <b>to</b> lift, lay down, and slaughter <b>a large</b> animal.
§ <b>Rava said:</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters with a blunt knife, even</b> if the completion of the slaughter lasts <b>the entire day,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid</b> provided there is no interruption in the midst of the slaughter.
<b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If there were several short <b>interruptions</b> during a single act of slaughter, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in terms of whether <b>they join</b> together to invalidate the slaughter if the sum of the durations of all the interruptions is greater than the maximum permitted interruption?
The Gemara challenges: <b>And let</b> Rava <b>resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from his own</b> statement, as he permitted an act of slaughter that lasts the entire day, during which there were presumably brief interruptions throughout. Apparently, the interruptions do not join together. The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> Rava was referring to a case <b>where there was no interruption,</b> as the slaughterer drew the knife back and forth throughout.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, raises a dilemma:</b> If one cut the majority of the <i>simanim</i> and then <b>interrupted</b> the slaughter before proceeding to cut the <b>minority of the <i>simanim</i>, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The slaughter is not valid <b>if he interrupted</b> the slaughter for an interval equivalent to the duration of an examination. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of <b>an examination? Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of <b>an examination</b> of the knife <b>by a Sage</b> prior to the slaughter of the animal. The Gemara objects: <b>If so, you have rendered your statement</b> subject <b>to circumstances,</b> as sometimes the Sage is near and sometimes the Sage is far, and the time required for examination varies accordingly. The Gemara responds: <b>Rather,</b> the reference is to an interval <b>equivalent</b> to the duration of <b>an examination</b> performed by <b>a slaughterer</b> who is <b>a Sage.</b> In that case, travel time is not factored in; only the time of the examination itself is considered, and this does not vary.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one cut the gullet</b> in the standard manner of slaughter with a back-and-forth movement, <b>and he severed the windpipe</b> not in the standard manner, <b>or</b> if <b>one severed the windpipe and thereafter cut the gullet, or</b> if <b>one cut one of</b> the <i>simanim</i> <b>and waited until</b> the animal <b>died, or</b> if one cut one <i>siman</i> and <b>concealed the knife beneath the second</b> <i>siman</i> <b>and severed it</b> from below, <b>Rabbi Yeshevav says:</b> The animal is <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> and imparts ritual impurity through contact with it and carrying it. <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> and although eating it is prohibited, it does not transmit ritual impurity.
<b>Rabbi Yeshevav stated a principle in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua: Any</b> animal <b>that was rendered unfit during its slaughter</b> because the slaughter was not performed properly <b>is an unslaughtered carcass; any</b> animal <b>whose slaughter was</b> performed <b>properly and another matter caused it to become unfit is a <i>tereifa</i>. And Rabbi Akiva conceded to his</b> opinion.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: If <b>one cut the gullet…and Rabbi Akiva conceded to his</b> opinion. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna at the beginning of the next chapter (42a): <b>These</b> wounds constitute <b><i>tereifot</i> in an animal:</b>

Daf 32b

An animal that has <b>a perforated gullet,</b> where the perforation goes through the wall of the gullet, <b>or</b> one with <b>a severed windpipe.</b> According to this mishna, the severed windpipe renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> and not an unslaughtered carcass. If Rabbi Akiva reconsidered his opinion and conceded to Rabbi Yeshevav, in accordance with the opinion of which <i>tanna</i> is that mishna?
<b>Rava said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where one cut</b> the gullet <b>and ultimately severed</b> the windpipe not in the standard manner. <b>There,</b> the mishna in the next chapter is referring to a case <b>where he severed</b> the windpipe not in the standard manner, <b>and ultimately cut</b> the gullet. If he <b>cut</b> the gullet <b>and ultimately severed</b> the windpipe, the animal <b>was rendered unfit during its slaughter;</b> therefore, it assumes the status of an unslaughtered carcass, according to the principle of Rabbi Yeshevav. But if <b>he severed</b> the windpipe <b>and ultimately cut</b> the gullet, it is <b>as</b> though <b>another matter caused</b> the animal <b>to become unfit;</b> therefore, it assumes the status of a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Huna raised an objection to Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>cut the gullet and</b> then <b>severed the windpipe,</b> or if one <b>severed the windpipe and cut the gullet thereafter,</b> the animal is <b>an unslaughtered carcass.</b> Apparently, contrary to Rava’s statement, the order is irrelevant, and even if the windpipe is severed first, the animal assumes the status of an unslaughtered carcass.
Rava said: <b>Say</b> that the latter case in the <i>baraita</i> means not that he cut the gullet thereafter; rather, it is a case where one severed the windpipe <b>and had already cut the gullet at the outset.</b>
Rav Aḥa bar Huna <b>said to him:</b> There are <b>two refutations of the statement,</b> i.e., of your attempt to answer the difficulty from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> is that if the second case in the <i>baraita</i> is one where he initially cut the gullet, then <b>that is</b> identical to <b>the first</b> case in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And furthermore, didn’t we learn</b> explicitly in the <i>baraita</i>: Or if one severed the windpipe and cut the gullet <b>thereafter,</b> the animal is an unslaughtered carcass?
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The use of the term: <i>Tereifot</i>, in the mishna in the next chapter is not to the exclusion of unslaughtered carcasses; rather, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that term in a general sense, meaning: <b>These</b> wounds serve to render an animal <b>forbidden; and there are</b> some <b>of them</b> that are <b>unslaughtered carcasses,</b> e.g., an animal with a severed windpipe, <b>and there are</b> some <b>of them</b> that are <b><i>tereifot</i>.</b>
The Gemara objects to that interpretation: If the mishna is listing those circumstances that render the animal an unslaughtered carcass, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>consider</b> the circumstance <b>of Ḥizkiyya as well, as Ḥizkiyya says:</b> If <b>one rendered</b> the animal like <b>a shard</b> by cutting it into two widthwise, its halakhic status is that of <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> even while it is convulsing before its death. <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>consider</b> the circumstance <b>of Rabbi Elazar as well, as Rabbi Elazar said:</b> If <b>the thigh,</b> the hind leg of the animal, <b>was removed and its recess</b> is obvious (see 21a), it is <b>an unslaughtered carcass.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>When</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the case of <b>an unslaughtered carcass,</b> it is a case where the animal <b>does not</b> assume that status and <b>impart impurity while alive. But</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> the case of <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> where the animal assumes that status and <b>imparts impurity while alive,</b> e.g., the cases of Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Elazar.
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> resolved the apparent contradiction between the mishna here and the mishna on 42a, and <b>said: Here,</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring to a case <b>where one cut</b> the gullet <b>in</b> the same <b>place</b> as the initial <b>cut</b> in the windpipe. <b>There,</b> on 42a, the <i>tanna</i> is referring to a case <b>where he cut</b> the gullet <b>not in</b> the same <b>place</b> as the initial <b>cut</b> in the windpipe. The reason for the distinction is that if <b>one cut</b> the gullet <b>in</b> the same <b>place</b> as the initial <b>cut</b> in the windpipe, it is an animal that <b>was rendered unfit during its slaughter</b> and it assumes the status of an unslaughtered carcass. By contrast, if he cut the gullet <b>not in</b> the same <b>place</b> as the initial <b>cut</b> in the windpipe it is <b>like</b> a case where <b>another matter caused</b> the animal <b>to become unfit.</b> Therefore, cutting the gullet renders it a <i>tereifa</i> and prevents it from imparting ritual impurity.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish say this,</b> that slaughter can be effective to prevent impurity after the windpipe was severed? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish say:</b> If one <b>cut the windpipe and the lung was perforated thereafter</b> before he cut the gullet, the animal is <b>fit</b> for consumption? <b>Apparently,</b> after cutting the windpipe, the status of the lungs, whose existence is dependent upon the windpipe, <b>is like</b> that of an item <b>that is placed in a basket;</b> they are irrelevant to the determination of the animal’s status. <b>Here too,</b> when the windpipe is severed at the beginning of the slaughter the windpipe should be considered <b>like</b> an item <b>that is placed in a basket</b> in the sense that the animal is considered to have only one <i>siman</i>, the gullet, and cutting of one <i>siman</i> does not affect the animal’s status.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The apparent contradiction is <b>not difficult. There</b> (42a), where it is stated that an animal with a severed windpipe is a <i>tereifa</i>, the mishna presents the opinion of Rabbi Akiva <b>before retraction</b> of his opinion. <b>Here,</b> the mishna presents the opinion of Rabbi Akiva <b>after retraction</b> of his opinion. <b>And</b> even though Rabbi Akiva retracted his opinion, <b>a mishna does not move from its place.</b> Once this version of the mishna was learned in the study hall, it remained valuable, even though it is no longer current.
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> that was cited previously. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> If one <b>cut the windpipe and the lung was perforated thereafter</b> before he cut the gullet, the animal is <b>fit</b> for consumption. <b>Rava said: Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish states</b> this principle <b>only with regard to a lung, since the function of the lung is dependent upon the windpipe.</b> Once the windpipe is severed it is as though the lungs were removed from the animal. <b>But with regard to innards</b> that were perforated after the windpipe was cut but before the slaughter was completed, <b>no,</b> the animal becomes a <i>tereifa</i>, because the function of the innards is not dependent on the windpipe.
<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to</b> Rava’s distinction. <b>Since</b> when <b>signs of being a <i>tereifa</i> developed</b> in the animal after the slaughter began, <b>you permitted</b> the animal and deemed the slaughter valid, <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if the perforation was <b>in</b> the <b>lung,</b> and <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if the perforation was <b>in</b> the <b>innards?</b> In either case, the animal should not be deemed a <i>tereifa</i> if the signs developed once the slaughter began.
<b>But Rabbi Zeira retracted</b> his objection, <b>as Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> If the <b>innards were perforated between</b> the cutting of the first <b><i>siman</i> and</b> the second <b><i>siman</i> what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Does the first <i>siman</i> join</b> together <b>with the second <i>siman</i> to purify</b> the animal <b>from</b> the impurity of <b>an unslaughtered carcass or not?</b>
<b>And we say: Isn’t this</b> the <b>dilemma that Ilfa raises: If a fetus extended its foreleg</b> outside the womb while the mother was being slaughtered, <b>between</b> the cutting of the first <b><i>siman</i>,</b> the windpipe, and the second <b><i>siman</i>,</b> the gullet, thereby causing the foreleg to have the status of a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?

Daf 33a

The Gemara clarifies this dilemma: <b>Does the first <i>siman</i> join</b> together <b>with the second <i>siman</i> to purify the animal from</b> the impurity of <b>an unslaughtered carcass or not?</b> In both cases the dilemma is: Does the cutting of the first <i>siman</i>, which serves the dual purpose of being a component of permitting consumption and preventing impurity of the animal, join together with the cutting of the second <i>siman</i>, which serves only the purpose of preventing impurity, in order to constitute a single act of slaughter and thereby prevent the animal from assuming the impurity of an unslaughtered carcass? Or perhaps because the cutting of each <i>siman</i> is performed for a different purpose they do not join together?
In any event, <b>we raise the dilemma only</b> in order <b>to purify</b> the foreleg <b>from</b> the impurity of <b>an unslaughtered carcass. But with regard to eating</b> the slaughtered animal, all agree that it is <b>forbidden,</b> as even Rabbi Zeira concedes that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> and retracts his objection to the distinction that Rava proposed between the lungs and the innards.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav said to Ravina: Perhaps</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>actually did not retract</b> his opinion, as even initially he held that there is no distinction between lungs and innards. If either is perforated after one <i>siman</i> was cut, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And Rabbi Zeira stated</b> his objection to the distinction of Rava <b>in accordance with the statement of Rava, but</b> he <b>himself does not hold accordingly.</b>
The Gemara continues its analysis of the statement of Reish Lakish, who said that after the windpipe is cut, the lung is considered as though it was placed in a basket, and if it is perforated before the slaughter is completed, the animal does not become a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov said: Learn from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> that <b>one may invite Jews</b> to eat the <b>innards</b> of an animal that was slaughtered, <b>but one may not invite gentiles</b> to eat the <b>innards</b> of an animal that was slaughtered, because they are forbidden to gentiles.
<b>What is the reason?</b> For <b>Jews the matter</b> of rendering the meat of the animal fit for consumption <b>is dependent upon</b> the performance of a valid act of <b>slaughter. Once there is full-fledged slaughter</b> and both <i>simanim</i> are cut, the innards <b>are permitted to them</b> even if the animal is convulsing. But with regard to <b>gentiles, for whom stabbing is sufficient</b> and slaughter is not required, the innards are permitted only after the animal is completely dead, since <b>the matter</b> of rendering the meat of the animal fit for consumption <b>is dependent upon</b> its <b>death.</b> Therefore, if the animal is still convulsing, <b>these</b> innards, which are considered to be outside the body after the cutting of the two <i>simanim</i>, are <b>considered like a limb from a living</b> animal and it is forbidden for gentiles to eat them.
<b>Rav Pappa said: I was sitting before Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov and I sought to say to him</b> that his statement is difficult: <b>Is there anything that is permitted for a Jew but prohibited for a gentile? But I did not say</b> that <b>to him, as I said</b> to myself: <b>Didn’t he say a reason</b> for his ruling? Therefore, there is no reason to ask the question.
The Gemara notes: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov: One who seeks to eat from</b> the meat of <b>an animal before its soul departs may cut an olive-bulk of meat from the area of the slaughter,</b> the neck, <b>and salt it very well,</b> i.e., more than is normally required, <b>and rinse it very well</b> in water to remove the salt and the blood, <b>and wait until the</b> animal’s <b>soul departs, and eat it.</b> It is <b>permitted</b> for <b>both a gentile and a Jew to</b> eat <b>it.</b> Contrary to the statement of Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov, there is no distinction between Jew and gentile.
This <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the statement of <b>Rav Idi bar Avin, as Rav Idi bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan says: One who seeks to recuperate</b> from an illness should <b>cut an olive-bulk of meat from the area of slaughter,</b> i.e., the neck, <b>of an animal, and salt it very well, and rinse it very well, and wait until the</b> animal’s <b>soul departs,</b> and eat it. It is <b>permitted</b> for <b>both a gentile and a Jew to</b> eat <b>it.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or a bird, and blood did not emerge from them</b> during the slaughter, all of these are <b>permitted</b> for consumption <b>and</b> do not require the ritual washing of the hands as <b>they may be eaten with ritually impure [<i>mesoavot</i>] hands, because they were not rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity through contact <b>with blood,</b> which is one of the seven liquids that render food susceptible to impurity. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: They were rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>by means of</b> the <b>slaughter</b> itself.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The <b>reason</b> that they may be eaten with ritually impure hands is <b>that blood did not emerge from</b> the animals or birds during the slaughter; <b>but</b> if <b>blood emerged from them</b> during slaughter, <b>they</b> may <b>not be eaten with ritually impure hands.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> not? Ordinary <b>hands are</b> impure with <b>second-degree</b> ritual impurity <b>and</b> an item of <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>cannot impart third-degree</b> impurity to <b>non-sacred</b> items with which it comes into contact.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>From where</b> is it ascertained <b>that we are dealing</b> in the mishna <b>with non-sacred</b> food, and not with the slaughter of an offering? That is clear, <b>as</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> in the list of those slaughtered: <b>An undomesticated animal. As, if</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring to the slaughter of <b>sacrificial</b> animals and birds, <b>is there</b> any <b>undomesticated animal</b> included <b>in</b> the framework of <b>sacrificial</b> animals? <b>And furthermore, if</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring <b>to sacrificial</b> animals, <b>when no blood emerges from them are</b> the offerings <b>valid?</b> The offering <b>itself requires blood,</b> as it is only through the presenting of the blood upon the altar that the offering is accepted.
<b>And furthermore, if</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>when blood emerges from them, does it render</b> them <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the blood of sacrificial</b> animals <b>does not render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated:</b> “You shall not eat it; <b>you shall pour it upon the earth like water”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:24). <b>Blood</b> of a non-sacred animal, <b>which is poured like water</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>renders</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. By contrast, blood of a sacrificial animal, <b>which is not poured like water</b> but is presented on the altar, <b>does not render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity.
<b>And furthermore, if</b> the <i>tanna</i> is referring to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>when blood does not emerge from them</b> are they <b>not</b> nevertheless rendered <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? <b>Let them be</b> rendered <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>by means of regard for sanctity, as we maintain</b> that <b>regard for sanctity renders</b> food <b>suceptible</b> to ritual impurity even in the absence of contact with any of the seven liquids.
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: Here we are dealing with non-sacred</b> food <b>that one purchased</b> in Jerusalem <b>with</b> second-<b>tithe money,</b> which assumes the status of the second-tithe produce. This produce, in turn, assumes third-degree impurity through contact with hands that have second-degree impurity. <b>And</b> this mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 11:5):

Daf 33b

With regard to <b>anything that by rabbinic law requires entry</b> into <b>water,</b> i.e., either immersion or ritual washing of the hands, although it is pure by Torah law, it is accorded second-degree impurity. Therefore, such an item <b>renders sacrificial</b> food <b>impure,</b> meaning that the sacrificial food becomes impure and transmits impurity to other sacrificial food, <b>and disqualifies <i>teruma</i>,</b> meaning that it renders the <i>teruma</i> itself impure, but not to the extent that the <i>teruma</i> can render other <i>teruma</i> impure. <b>And</b> it <b>is permitted for non-sacred</b> food <b>and for</b> second-<b>tithe</b> produce to come in contact with such an item, and no impurity is thereby transmitted. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis prohibit</b> items that require entry into water from coming in contact <b>with</b> second-<b>tithe</b> produce, as they hold that the produce is thereby rendered impure. According to the Rabbis, the status of second-tithe produce is more stringent than that of non-sacred food, and second-tithe produce assumes third-degree impurity upon contact with an item of second-degree impurity, which is in accordance with the opinion of the mishna.
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi objects to</b> this interpretation of that mishna. <b>From where</b> is it clear that it is contact that the Rabbis prohibit? <b>Perhaps the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Meir only with regard to</b> a person with second-degree impurity <b>partaking of</b> second-<b>tithe</b> produce. <b>But with regard to contact</b> of an individual with second-degree impurity with second-<b>tithe</b> produce <b>or</b> his <b>eating non-sacred</b> food, <b>they do not disagree.</b>
<b>And this</b> case in the mishna <b>is</b> a case involving <b>contact</b> with the flesh of the slaughtered animal, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches: They may be eaten with ritually impure hands,</b> in the passive form, and not: One may eat them with impure hands. <b>Are we not dealing</b> with a case where <b>another</b> with impure hands <b>fed him,</b> but the one eating it was ritually pure and did not touch it? Therefore, the case in the mishna here, which indicates that it is forbidden for one with impure hands to touch the flesh if it has come in contact with the blood, cannot be referring to an animal purchased in Jerusalem with second-tithe money. The reason is that in that case, the Rabbis concede that contact with second-tithe produce, even produce rendered susceptible to ritual impurity by the blood, is permitted for one whose hands are impure with second-degree ritual impurity.
<b>Rather Rav Pappa said: Here,</b> in the mishna, <b>we are dealing with hands</b> that are impure with <b>first-degree</b> ritual impurity, which render even non-sacred food impure. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In those cases where <b>hands</b> have <b>first-degree</b> impurity, it is <b>not</b> that they render <b>non-sacred</b> food impure; rather, it means that they impart to <i>teruma</i> and sacrificial food second-degree impurity rather than third-degree impurity. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> In those cases where <b>hands</b> have <b>first-degree</b> impurity, it means that they render <b>non-sacred</b> food impure. <b>And</b> in those cases where hands have <b>second-degree</b> impurity it means that they invalidate <b><i>teruma</i></b> and impart to it third-degree impurity.
The Gemara asks: Did Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar say that in those cases where hands have <b>first-degree</b> impurity, with regard <b>to non-sacred</b> food, <b>yes,</b> they render it impure, but with regard <b>to <i>teruma</i>,</b> hands do <b>not</b> render it impure? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar <b>is saying:</b> In those cases where hands have <b>first-degree</b> impurity, it means that they render <b>even non-sacred</b> food impure, and all the more so they render <i>teruma</i> impure. But in those cases where hands have <b>second-degree</b> impurity, it means that with regard <b>to <i>teruma</i>, yes, the hands</b> invalidate <b><i>teruma</i></b> and impart third-degree impurity, but with regard <b>to non-sacred</b> food, hands do <b>not</b> render it impure.
The Gemara asks: <b>And are there</b> cases where <b>hands</b> assume <b>first-degree</b> impurity? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Yadayim</i> 3:1): If <b>one inserts his hands into a leprous house</b> (see Leviticus 14:33–53) <b>his hands</b> assume <b>first-degree</b> impurity as though his entire body entered the house; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis say: His hands</b> assume <b>second-degree</b> impurity.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Everyone</b> agrees <b>that</b> in principle, <b>partial entry</b> into a leprous house <b>is not characterized</b> as <b>entry</b> in terms of rendering one who enters impure. Therefore, one who inserted his hands into the house is not impure by Torah law. <b>And here,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> a rabbinic <b>decree</b> that renders his hands impure that <b>they disagree:</b> The Sages issued a decree that if one inserted his hands into a leprous house, <b>his hands</b> are impure <b>due to</b> the impurity by Torah law that one assumes when he enters the house with his entire <b>body.</b> The objective of the decree is to prevent him from entering the leprous house.
One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>holds</b> that when <b>the Sages</b> issued the decree they determined that the status of <b>his hands</b> inserted into the house is <b>like</b> the status of <b>his body</b> that enters the house, first-degree impurity. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>the Sages rendered</b> the status of <b>hands</b> inserted into the house <b>like</b> the status of <b>hands in general,</b> with regard to which they issued a decree of second-degree impurity, even if they had been washed.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why did Rav Pappa interpret the mishna in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar? <b>Let</b> Rav Pappa <b>interpret</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says:</b> If one inserts his hands into a leprous house, <b>his hands</b> assume <b>first-degree</b> impurity. The Gemara answers: <b>Perhaps when Rabbi Akiva says</b> that one’s hands assume first-degree impurity, <b>that statement</b> applies only <b>in</b> cases of <b><i>teruma</i> and sacrificial</b> food, <b>which are stringent. But</b> with regard <b>to non-sacred</b> food, perhaps hands <b>are</b> impure only with <b>second-degree</b> impurity.
The Gemara objects: <b>And let</b> hands <b>also be</b> impure only with <b>second-degree</b> impurity and the mishna could still be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. <b>As we heard that Rabbi Akiva says:</b> An item of <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>imparts third-degree</b> impurity to <b>non-sacred</b> items.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sota</i> 27b): <b>On that day,</b> when Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya was appointed <i>Nasi</i> in Yavne, <b>Rabbi Akiva taught: “And every earthenware vessel</b> into which any of them falls, whatever is in <b>it shall be impure,</b> and you shall break it” (Leviticus 11:33). With regard to the item rendered impure in the vessel, <b>it is not stated:</b> It <b>is impure [<i>tameh</i>]; rather,</b> the term <b>“it shall be impure [<i>yitma</i>]”</b> is stated, indicating that the item has the capacity <b>to transmit impurity to other</b> items. <b>This</b> verse <b>teaches about a loaf</b> with <b>second-degree</b> impurity that had been rendered impure in the airspace of an earthenware vessel in which there was a creeping animal, <b>that</b> through contact <b>it renders non-sacred</b> food impure with <b>third-degree</b> ritual impurity.
The Gemara explains: <b>Perhaps this statement,</b> that non-sacred food becomes impure with third-degree ritual impurity, applies only <b>with regard to impurity by Torah law,</b> e.g., a creeping animal; <b>but with regard to</b> impurity by <b>rabbinic law,</b> e.g., impurity of hands, that is <b>not</b> the <i>halakha</i>.
<b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that <b>Rabbi Hoshaya said</b> a third explanation of the mishna: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case of <b>non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food. <b>And</b> the mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 2:2): <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One who eats food</b> with <b>first-degree</b> ritual impurity assumes <b>first-degree</b> impurity. One who eats food with <b>second-degree</b> ritual impurity assumes <b>second-degree</b> impurity. One who eats food with <b>third-degree</b> impurity assumes <b>third-degree</b> impurity.
The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: One who eats food</b> with <b>first-degree or second-degree</b> impurity assumes <b>second-degree</b> impurity. One with second-degree impurity who comes into contact with <i>teruma</i> disqualifies it, but does not render it impure. One who eats food with <b>third-degree</b> impurity assumes <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>vis-à-vis sacrificial</b> food, i.e., his contact with sacrificial food renders it impure with the capacity to transmit impurity to other sacrificial food, <b>but</b> does <b>not</b> assume <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>vis-à-vis <i>teruma</i>,</b> and his contact with <i>teruma</i> does not disqualify it.
Eating an item that has third-degree impurity is feasible only in the case of non-sacred food, as partaking of impure <i>teruma</i> or sacrificial food is prohibited. Generic non-sacred food cannot contract third-degree impurity at all. Therefore, the case of one who eats food that has third-degree impurity is referring specifically <b>to non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of <i>teruma</i>.</b>
The Gemara infers from Rabbi Yehoshua’s statement that if one prepares items as if their level of purity were <b>on the</b> level of <b>purity of <i>teruma</i>,</b> then <b>yes,</b> they have the status like <i>teruma</i>, but if one prepares items as if their level of purity were <b>on the</b> level of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food, they do <b>not</b> have the status like sacrificial food, and such items would not contract third-degree impurity. This indicates that Rabbi Yehoshua <b>holds</b> that <b>non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food <b>do not</b> assume <b>third-degree</b> impurity.
The Gemara objects: <b>Let us interpret</b> the mishna

Daf 34a

<b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of <i>teruma</i> and</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>It</b> should <b>not enter your mind</b> that the mishna is referring to a case of the level of purity of <i>teruma</i>, <b>as</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> a case of the slaughter of animals and birds and consumption of their <b>meat.</b> And <b>if</b> the mishna is taught <b>with regard to</b> non-sacred food items that were prepared on the level of purity of <b><i>teruma</i>, is there meat</b> eaten with the level of purity of <i>teruma</i>? The practice of preparing non-sacred food items on the level of purity of <i>teruma</i> is done only so that one will not treat actual <i>teruma</i> in the correct manner, and <i>teruma</i> is separated only from produce that grows in the ground.
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what</b> is the case in the mishna? Is it a case of non-sacred food items that were prepared on the level of purity of <b>sacrificial</b> food? <b>Is there an undomesticated animal</b> that can be sacrificed as an offering and its meat is <b>sacrificial</b> food? The Gemara answers: Although undomesticated animals cannot be sacrificed as an offering, there are those who would undertake to eat their meat only when prepared on the level of purity of sacrificial food because <b>meat</b> of an undomesticated animal is sometimes <b>interchanged with meat</b> of a domesticated animal. No one would undertake to eat meat only when prepared on the level of purity of <i>teruma</i>, because <b>meat</b> would <b>not</b> be <b>interchanged with produce.</b>
<b>Ulla said:</b> My <b>colleagues say</b> that the mishna is referring to the case <b>of non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food, <b>and</b> the mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> who says: Non-sacred food items that were prepared on the level of purity of <i>teruma</i> assume third-degree impurity, but non-sacred food items that were prepared on the level of purity of sacrificial food do not assume third-degree impurity.
Ulla continues: <b>And I say</b> that the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> and when he said that non-sacred food items that were prepared on the level of purity of <i>teruma</i> assume third-degree impurity, he <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary. It is not necessary</b> to say that in the case of <b>non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food, <b>which is stringent, that they have</b> the capacity of assuming <b>third-degree</b> impurity. <b>Rather, even non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of <i>teruma</i> also have</b> the capacity of assuming <b>third-degree</b> impurity.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who are the colleagues</b> to whom Ulla referred? <b>It is Rabba bar bar Ḥana, as Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What did Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua reply to each other?</b> The differences between their opinions are twofold. First, Rabbi Eliezer holds that one who eats food with first-degree impurity assumes first-degree impurity, while according to Rabbi Yehoshua he assumes second-degree impurity. Second, Rabbi Eliezer holds that one who eats food with third-degree impurity assumes third-degree impurity, while according to Rabbi Yehoshua he assumes second-degree impurity vis-à-vis sacrificial food but not vis-à-vis <i>teruma</i>.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to Rabbi Yehoshua:</b> The basis for my opinion that one assumes the level of impurity of that which he ate is that <b>we found</b> a case where the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the one who eats</b> a food item <b>is more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the food</b> itself. <b>As, the carcass of a kosher bird</b> on <b>the outside,</b> i.e., when one comes into contact with it, <b>does not impart ritual impurity, while</b> one who <b>eats</b> the carcass of the kosher bird <b>renders</b> his <b>garments impure</b> when the food is <b>in</b> his <b>throat. And we,</b> in light of that, <b>how will we not deem one who eats</b> the impure item to be on a level of impurity at least <b>like</b> that of <b>the food</b> that he ate?
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua</b> responded that <b>we do not derive</b> other cases <b>from the</b> case of the <b>carcass of a kosher bird, because it is a novel</b> ruling that cannot serve as a paradigm. <b>Rather, we found that</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>food is more stringent than</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the one who eats</b> it, <b>as food</b> becomes impure if its measure is <b>that</b> of <b>an egg-bulk, and</b> one who <b>eats</b> impure food does not become impure <b>until he eats half of a half-loaf. And we,</b> in light of that, <b>how will we deem one who eats</b> the impure item to be on a level of impurity <b>like</b> that of <b>the food</b> that he ate?
<b>And Rabbi Eliezer</b> responded: <b>We do not derive</b> the relative stringency of ritual <b>impurity from</b> the relative size of halakhic <b>measures,</b> as measures are not indicative of stringency or leniency. <b>And furthermore, according to your statement, that</b> which <b>you say with regard to one who eats food</b> with <b>first-degree</b> ritual impurity, that he assumes <b>second-degree</b> impurity, what <b>you say</b> is <b>well.</b> But <b>that</b> which <b>you say</b> with regard to one who eats food with <b>second-degree</b> impurity, that he assumes <b>second-degree</b> impurity, <b>why</b> is that the case? It contradicts your reasoning.
Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>We found that</b> food with <b>second</b>-<b>degree</b> impurity <b>renders</b> other food impure with <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>by means of liquids.</b> Liquids that come into contact with food with second-degree impurity render other food with which they come into contact impure with second-degree impurity.
Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: But aren’t</b> those <b>liquids also</b> impure with <b>first-degree</b> ritual impurity through contact with an item impure with second-degree impurity? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Para</i> 8:7): <b>Any</b> item with second-degree ritual impurity that <b>disqualifies <i>teruma</i> renders liquids impure</b> with <b>first-degree</b> ritual impurity. These liquids assume a degree of impurity greater than that of the item that rendered them impure. This rabbinic decree applies to all people and items with second-degree impurity <b>except</b> for <b>one</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed. Liquids with which he comes into contact follow the standard course of transmitted impurity and assume third-degree impurity, one level below his own impurity.
Rabbi Eliezer questioned the next segment in the ruling of Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>And furthermore,</b> that which you say with regard to one who eats food with <b>third-degree</b> impurity, that he assumes <b>second-degree</b> impurity vis-à-vis sacrificial food, <b>why</b> is that the <i>halakha</i>? It contradicts your reasoning.
Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>I too stated</b> that one who eats food with third-degree impurity assumes second-degree impurity vis-à-vis sacrificial food <b>only with regard to</b> one who eats non-sacred food items that were prepared on the level of purity of <b><i>teruma</i>, as its</b> state of <b>purity</b>

Daf 34b

<b>is impurity vis-à-vis sacrificial</b> food. The Sages issued a decree that even one who is vigilant to partake of his <i>teruma</i> in a state of ritual purity is considered impure vis-à-vis one partaking of sacrificial food. Therefore, one who ate a food item that was prepared on the level of purity of <i>teruma</i> that had become impure with third-degree impurity assumes second-degree impurity, and he renders sacrificial food impure.
<b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> With regard to <b>one who eats non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food, and these items had become impure with <b>third-degree</b> impurity, <b>his body becomes</b> impure with <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>vis-à-vis sacrificial</b> food. He renders sacrificial food with which he comes into contact impure with third-degree impurity, and that food in turn disqualifies sacrificial food with which it comes into contact.
<b>Rabbi Zeira raised an objection to</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Asi</b> from the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua: One who eats food with <b>third-degree</b> impurity assumes <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>vis-à-vis sacrificial</b> food <b>but</b> does <b>not</b> assume <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>vis-à-vis <i>teruma</i>.</b> This is stated <b>in</b> the case of <b>non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>Yes,</b> one is able to prepare items <b>on the</b> level of <b>purity of <i>teruma</i>,</b> but one is <b>not</b> able to prepare items <b>on the</b> level of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food, as in the latter case the non-sacred food does not become impure at all.
Rabbi Asi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: That inference is incorrect, as Rabbi Yehoshua <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary.</b> It is not necessary to say that in the case of non-sacred food items that were prepared on the level of purity of sacrificial food, which is stringent, they have the capacity of assuming third-degree impurity. Rabbi Yehoshua teaches that non-sacred food items that were prepared on the level of purity of <i>teruma</i> also have the capacity of assuming third-degree impurity.
The Gemara objects: <b>But didn’t</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>say</b> to Rabbi Eliezer according to the explanation that Rabba bar bar Ḥana said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: <b>I too stated</b> this <b>only with regard to</b> non-sacred food items that were prepared on the level of purity of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> indicating that he was not referring to non-sacred food items that were prepared on the level of purity of sacrificial food. The Gemara explains: Rabba bar bar Ḥana and Rabbi Asi <b>are <i>amora’im</i>, and</b> disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> and they disagree about whether the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua was stated specifically with regard to non-sacred food items that were prepared on the level of purity of <i>teruma</i>, or whether it includes even those prepared on the level of purity of sacrificial food.
§ <b>Ulla says: One who eats non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of <i>teruma</i></b> and that are impure with <b>third-degree</b> impurity, <b>his body is disqualified from</b> the right <b>to partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Ulla <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learn</b> in the mishna cited earlier (33b) from tractate <i>Teharot</i>: One who eats food with <b>third-degree</b> impurity assumes <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>vis-à-vis sacrificial</b> food, <b>but</b> does <b>not</b> assume <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>vis-à-vis <i>teruma</i>.</b> This is stated <b>in</b> the case of <b>non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Gemara infers: It is <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>that he does not assume, but third-degree</b> impurity <b>he assumes,</b> and he is therefore disqualified from partaking of <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara answers: It was necessary for Ulla to teach this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as if</b> it was learned <b>from that</b> mishna, <b>I would say</b> that vis-à-vis <i>teruma</i> <b>he assumes neither second-degree nor third-degree</b> impurity, as there is no reason to deem the status of one who eats like that of the food that he ate. <b>And</b> perhaps it was only <b>since</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said</b> that he assumes <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>vis-à-vis sacrificial</b> food that he <b>also said</b> that he does <b>not</b> assume <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>vis-à-vis <i>teruma</i>.</b> Therefore, Ulla <b>teaches us</b> that he assumes third-degree impurity and is disqualified from partaking of <i>teruma</i>.
<b>Rav Hamnuna raised an objection to</b> the statement of <b>Ulla</b> from a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 2:3): <b>Non-sacred</b> food that is impure with <b>first-degree</b> impurity is <b>impure and renders</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>impure</b> in the sense that this <i>teruma</i> disqualifies other <i>teruma</i> with which it comes into contact. Non-sacred food that is impure with <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>disqualifies</b> <i>teruma</i>, <b>but</b> it does <b>not</b> render <i>teruma</i> <b>impure,</b> meaning that it renders the <i>teruma</i> itself impure, but not to the extent that the <i>teruma</i> can render other <i>teruma</i> impure. <b>And</b> food that is impure with <b>third-degree</b> impurity may be <b>eaten</b> by a priest <b>in a stew</b> that is <b>a mixture</b> containing spices of <i>teruma</i>.
<b>And if you say</b> that by partaking of food that is impure with third-degree impurity <b>his body is disqualified from</b> the right <b>to partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> do <b>we feed him a matter that invalidates his body</b> from the right to partake of <i>teruma</i>? According to this, when eating the stew that contains food that is impure with third-degree impurity, he is disqualified from partaking of the spices of <i>teruma</i> that the mishna permits him to add to the stew. Ulla <b>said to him: Leave</b> the matter of <b>stew</b> that is <b>a mixture</b> containing spices of <i>teruma</i>,

Daf 35a

<b>as there is not an olive-bulk</b> of <i>teruma</i> in the amount of stew that he eats <b>in</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread. Therefore, one need not treat the mixture with the level of purity required of <i>teruma</i>.
<b>Rabbi Yonatan says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> For <b>one who partakes of actual <i>teruma</i> that</b> is impure with <b>third-degree</b> impurity, it is <b>prohibited to partake</b> of other <i>teruma</i>, <b>but</b> it is <b>permitted to come into contact</b> with <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara notes that the statement <b>of Ulla was necessary and</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yonatan was necessary. As, if</b> the <i>halakha</i> were learned exclusively <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Ulla, I would say: This statement</b> applies <b>with regard to non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of <i>teruma</i>, but</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i></b> itself perhaps <b>contact is also prohibited.</b> Therefore, the statement <b>of Rabbi Yonatan was necessary. And if</b> the <i>halakha</i> were learned exclusively <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yonatan, I would say: This statement</b> applies with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>, but</b> with regard to <b>non-sacred</b> food that was prepared with purity of <i>teruma</i>, perhaps <b>eating</b> it is <b>also permitted.</b> Therefore, both statements <b>are necessary.</b>
§ <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta was sitting before Rav Naḥman, and he was sitting and saying:</b> With regard to <b>one who eats non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food, and these items had become impure with <b>third-degree</b> impurity, he <b>is ritually pure</b> in terms of the right <b>to partake of sacrificial</b> food, <b>as you have nothing that confers fourth-degree</b> impurity <b>in sacrificial</b> food <b>other than consecrated sacrificial</b> food <b>alone,</b> but non-sacred food prepared with the purity of sacrificial food does not.
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raises an objection</b> from the mishna cited earlier (33b): One who eats food with <b>third-degree</b> impurity assumes <b>second</b>-<b>degree</b> impurity <b>vis-à-vis sacrificial</b> food, <b>and</b> he does <b>not</b> assume <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>vis-à-vis <i>teruma</i>.</b> Eating an item with third-degree impurity is feasible only in the case of non-sacred items, as partaking of impure <i>teruma</i> is prohibited. It is only possible <b>in</b> the case of <b>non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared</b> as if their level of purity were <b>on the</b> level of the <b>purity of <i>teruma</i>.</b> According to the statement of Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta, <b>why</b> does this food assume second-degree impurity? <b>It is not sacrificial</b> food, which is <b>sanctified.</b>
Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta <b>said to him: Leave <i>teruma</i></b> alone; <b>its</b> state of <b>purity is impurity vis-à-vis sacrificial</b> food. Therefore, non-sacred food that was prepared with the purity of <i>teruma</i> renders sacrificial food impure.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do you say</b> that the purity of <i>teruma</i> is impurity vis-à-vis sacrificial food? It is from a mishna (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 18b), <b>as we learned:</b> The halakhic status of <b>the garments of an <i>am ha’aretz</i>,</b> who does not scrupulously observe the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity, is like that of items rendered impure by <b>treading,</b> e.g., items designated for sitting or lying upon which a <i>zav</i> or a menstruating woman sits or lies, which are rendered a primary source of ritual impurity <b>for individuals who scrupulously observe</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual purity [<i>perushin</i>]</b> and eat their non-sacred food in a state of purity. In other words, it is considered a primary level of impurity for them. The halakhic status of <b>the garments of <i>perushin</i></b> is like that of items rendered impure by <b>treading for</b> priests <b>who partake of <i>teruma</i>.</b> In addition, the halakhic status of <b>the garments of</b> priests <b>who partake of <i>teruma</i></b> is like that of items rendered impure by <b>treading for</b> those who eat <b>sacrificial</b> food.
<b>Rava said: Are you saying</b> that one can cite proof from the <i>halakha</i> of items rendered impure by <b>treading</b> that the state of purity of <i>teruma</i> is impurity vis-à-vis sacrificial food? No proof may be cited from there, as the decree that the halakhic status of the garments of priests who partake of <i>teruma</i> is like that of items rendered impure by <b>treading</b> for those who eat sacrificial food <b>is different,</b>

Daf 35b

as with regard to garments there is concern <b>lest his wife sit upon them</b> when she is impure with the impurity of <b>a menstruating woman. But with regard to produce, we do not say</b> that if it was prepared with the purity of <i>teruma</i> it renders sacrificial food impure, <b>and Rabbi Yitzḥak states</b> his <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to produce as well.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak: <b>And do we say with regard to produce</b> that if it was prepared with the purity of <i>teruma</i> it renders sacrificial food impure? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥagiga</i> 24b): It is not permitted for a priest to accept <i>teruma</i> wine from an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, but <b>if</b> an <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>says</b> to the priest: <b>I separated</b> and placed <b>into</b> this barrel of <i>teruma</i> wine <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of sacrificial</b> wine, <b>he is deemed credible? And</b> this indicates that <b><i>teruma</i> does not render the sacrificial</b> food <b>impure. And if you say</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i> that <b>its</b> state of <b>purity is impurity vis-à-vis sacrificial</b> food, <b>let the <i>teruma</i> render</b> the <b>sacrificial</b> food <b>impure.</b>
Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti: <b>Are you are saying</b> that there is an objection to my opinion based on the case of <b>impurity in</b> a case of food items, the <i>teruma</i> wine and the sacrificial wine, that are <b>attached</b> in one barrel? <b>Impurity in</b> a case of food items that are <b>attached is different, as, since</b> the <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>is deemed credible with regard to the sacrificial</b> food, <b>he is deemed credible with regard to the <i>teruma</i> as well.</b>
<b>Rav Huna bar Natan raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> to the opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak with regard to rendering sacrificial food impure with fourth-degree ritual impurity: <b>Non-sacred</b> food that is impure with <b>second-degree</b> impurity <b>renders impure</b> through contact <b>a non-sacred liquid,</b> which assumes first-degree impurity, <b>and disqualifies <i>teruma</i> foods,</b> in the sense that those foods are impure but do not transmit impurity to other food. <b>And</b> non-sacred food that is impure with <b>third-degree</b> impurity <b>renders impure</b> through contact <b>a sacrificial liquid and disqualifies sacrificial foods, in</b> the case of <b>non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food. This contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak, who said that there is nothing that confers fourth-degree impurity in sacrificial food other than consecrated sacrificial food alone, but not non-sacred food prepared with the purity of sacrificial food.
The Gemara answers that this matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The halakhic status of <b>non-sacred</b> food items <b>that were prepared on the</b> level of <b>purity of sacrificial</b> food <b>is like</b> that of <b>non-sacred</b> foods, and they are incapable of assuming third-degree impurity.
<b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says:</b> The halakhic status of non-sacred food items that were prepared on the level of purity of sacrificial food <b>is like</b> that of <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> Accordingly, a primary source of ritual impurity is able <b>to render two</b> items <b>impure:</b> The food item with which it comes into contact assumes first-degree impurity, and the food item with which that came into contact assumes second-degree impurity. <b>And</b> that item is able <b>to disqualify one</b> further item, which assumes third-degree impurity but will not render sacrificial food impure with fourth-degree impurity. According to both opinions in this <i>baraita</i>, non-sacred food prepared with the purity of sacrificial food does not disqualify sacrificial food. According to the mishna in <i>Teharot</i>, it does disqualify sacrificial food.
§ The mishna states (33a): In the case of one who slaughters a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or a bird, and blood did not emerge from them, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: They were rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>by means of</b> the <b>slaughter</b> itself. <b>Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon would say:</b> It is <b>its slaughter</b> that <b>renders it susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, <b>and not</b> the <b>blood</b> that emerges during the slaughter.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the mishna <b>supports</b> the opinion of Rav Asi. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: They were rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>by means of</b> the <b>slaughter</b> itself. The Gemara asks: <b>What, is it not</b> that Rabbi Shimon is saying: <b>By means of</b> the <b>slaughter and not by means of</b> the <b>blood</b> from the slaughter? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> perhaps Rabbi Shimon is saying: The animal can be rendered susceptible to ritual impurity by means of blood and <b>also by means of slaughter.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i> is support of Rav Asi’s statement. <b>Rabbi Shimon said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>Is it blood that renders</b> the animal <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? <b>But isn’t it slaughter</b> that <b>renders</b> it <b>susceptible?</b> This indicates that Rabbi Shimon holds that it is specifically the slaughter and not the blood that renders the flesh susceptible to impurity. The Gemara rejects this proof. <b>This</b> is what Rabbi Shimon <b>is saying to</b> the Rabbis: <b>Is it blood alone that renders</b> the animal <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? <b>Slaughter too renders</b> it <b>susceptible.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i> contrary to Rav Asi’s statement. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Blood of the</b> animal that is <b>dead</b> of natural causes <b>does not render</b> food items <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. <b>What, is it not</b> that one may infer that <b>blood of slaughter renders</b> food items <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? The Gemara rejects this proof. <b>No,</b> infer that <b>blood of</b> animals that <b>are killed renders</b> food items <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>blood of slaughter, what</b> then is the <i>halakha</i>; that <b>it does not render</b> food items <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity?
If so, <b>let</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>teach us</b> that <b>blood of slaughter</b> does not render the animal susceptible to ritual impurity, <b>and</b> we will conclude that <b>all the more so</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>blood of the</b> animal that is <b>dead</b> as a result of natural causes. The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> Rabbi Shimon to teach the <i>halakha</i> of <b>blood of the</b> animal that is <b>dead</b> as a result of natural causes, as it could <b>enter your mind to say: What</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if <b>one killed</b> the animal <b>himself,</b> and <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if the animal was <b>killed</b> by <b>the angel of death?</b> In both cases the blood should render the animal susceptible to ritual impurity. Therefore, Rabbi Shimon <b>teaches us</b> that unlike blood of an animal that was killed, blood of an animal that is dead as a result of natural causes does not render food items susceptible to ritual impurity, and no inference may be drawn with regard to blood of slaughter.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another <i>baraita</i> contrary to Rav Asi’s statement. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Blood of</b> the <b>wound</b> of an animal <b>does not render</b> other items <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. <b>What, is it not</b> that one may infer that <b>blood of slaughter renders</b> food items <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? The Gemara rejects this proof. <b>No,</b> infer that <b>blood of</b> animals that <b>are killed renders</b> food items <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>blood of slaughter, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>; that <b>it does not render</b> food items <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity?
If so, <b>let</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>teach us</b> that <b>blood of slaughter</b> does not render the animal susceptible to ritual impurity, <b>and</b> we will conclude that <b>all the more so</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>blood of its wound.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> Rabbi Shimon to teach <b>blood of its wound,</b> as it could <b>enter your mind to say: What</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if <b>one killed</b> the <b>entire</b> animal, and <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if <b>one killed half</b> of the animal, i.e., wounded it? In both cases the blood should render the animal susceptible to ritual impurity. Therefore, Rabbi Shimon teaches that unlike the blood of an animal that was killed, the blood from an animal’s wound does not render food items susceptible to ritual impurity, and no inference may be drawn with regard to blood of slaughter.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> with regard to <b>blood of</b> animals that <b>are killed that they render</b> food items <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity? It is due to the fact <b>that it is written:</b> “Behold, they are a people that rises up as a lioness, and as a lion he lifts himself up; he shall not lie down until he eats of the prey <b>and drinks blood of carcasses”</b> (Numbers 23:24). The fact that the blood of a carcass, which in the context of the verse is referring to an animal that was killed, is mentioned in the context of drinking, indicates that it is a liquid that renders food items susceptible to ritual impurity.
With regard to <b>blood of slaughter it is also written:</b> “Only, you shall not eat the blood; <b>you shall pour it upon the earth as water”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:16). The parallel to water ostensibly indicates that the blood of slaughter should also render food items susceptible to ritual impurity. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse is not written with regard to susceptibility to impurity. The purpose for <b>which</b> it <b>comes</b> is <b>to permit benefit</b> from the <b>blood of disqualified consecrated</b> animals.

Daf 36a

It could <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> benefit from disqualified consecrated animals <b>is forbidden with regard to</b> their <b>fleece and labor,</b> perhaps benefit from <b>their blood</b> is also forbidden, and <b>let</b> it <b>require burial.</b> Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that benefit from their blood is permitted.
<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that the verse: <b>“And drinks the blood of carcasses,”</b> from which it is derived that the blood of an animal that was killed renders food items susceptible to ritual impurity, serves to <b>exclude blood</b> that emerges in <b>a surge</b> due to arterial pressure at the moment of slaughter while the animal is still alive <b>that does not render seeds susceptible to</b> ritual impurity.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who <b>slaughters</b> an animal <b>and splashed blood</b> of the slaughter <b>on a gourd</b> of <i>teruma</i>, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The gourd is <b>rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya says:</b> If the gourd came into contact with a source of impurity, <b>one places</b> the matter <b>in abeyance,</b> as there is uncertainty whether the blood rendered it susceptible to impurity.
<b>Rabbi Oshaya said: Since Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that the gourd is <b>rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>and Rabbi Ḥiyya says</b> that <b>one places</b> the matter <b>in abeyance, on whom shall we rely? Come and let us rely on the statement of Rabbi Shimon, as Rabbi Shimon would say:</b> It is <b>slaughter</b> that <b>renders</b> the animal <b>susceptible, and not blood.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> in explanation: <b>Everyone,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Ḥiyya, <b>agrees</b> that <b>where there is blood</b> on the gourd throughout the slaughter continuously <b>from beginning to end, everyone,</b> both Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, who says: Slaughter is defined only as the conclusion of its performance, and Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says: Slaughter is defined from the beginning to the end of its performance, <b>agrees that</b> the blood <b>renders</b> the gourd <b>susceptible</b> to impurity, in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, who disagree with Rabbi Shimon. <b>When they disagree</b> is in a case <b>where the blood is wiped</b> off the gourd <b>between</b> the cutting of one <b><i>siman</i> and</b> the other <b><i>siman</i>. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>slaughter is</b> defined <b>from</b> the <b>beginning to</b> the <b>end</b> of its performance, <b>and this blood</b> that splashed on the gourd <b>is blood of slaughter.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya holds</b> that <b>slaughter is</b> defined <b>only</b> as <b>the conclusion</b> of its performance, <b>and this is blood of a wound,</b> which does not render food items susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the ruling of Rabbi Ḥiyya that <b>one places</b> the matter <b>in abeyance?</b> It means that <b>one places</b> the matter <b>in abeyance until</b> the <b>conclusion of</b> the <b>slaughter. If there is blood</b> remaining on the gourd <b>at the conclusion of the slaughter</b> the blood <b>renders</b> the gourd <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, <b>and if not,</b> the blood <b>does not render</b> the gourd <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> is the meaning of the statement of Rabbi Oshaya: <b>Come and let us rely on the statement of Rabbi Shimon?</b> According <b>to Rabbi Shimon</b> the blood of slaughter <b>does not render</b> food items <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, while according <b>to Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> the blood of slaughter <b>renders</b> the gourd <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity.
The Gemara answers that in a case <b>where</b> the blood <b>is wiped</b> off the gourd prior to the conclusion of slaughter, <b>in any event,</b> the opinions of Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>correspond to each other:</b> One <b>Sage</b> holds that the blood of slaughter <b>does not render</b> the gourd <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>and</b> the other <b>Sage</b> holds that the blood of slaughter <b>does not render</b> the gourd <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. The result is that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that the blood of slaughter renders the gourd susceptible to ritual impurity, <b>is one</b> Sage stating an individual opinion, <b>and the statement of one</b> Sage <b>has no</b> standing <b>in a place</b> where it is disputed by <b>two</b> Sages.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the term: <b>One places</b> the matter <b>in abeyance, indicates</b> that it remains in abeyance <b>forever.</b> It is a fundamental halakhic uncertainty for which there is no resolution. <b>And</b> in the case where the blood is <b>wiped</b> off the gourd prior to the conclusion of the slaughter, the <i>halakha</i> is unclear. This is because <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya is uncertain whether slaughter is</b> defined <b>from</b> the <b>beginning to</b> the <b>end</b> of its performance <b>or whether slaughter is</b> defined <b>only</b> as the <b>conclusion</b> of its performance. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of his ruling that <b>one places</b> the matter <b>in abeyance?</b> It means that if a source of impurity comes into contact with the gourd after the blood was wiped off the gourd, <b>one may neither eat</b> the gourd, as perhaps it is impure <i>teruma</i>, <b>nor may one burn</b> it, as perhaps it is pure.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to this explanation, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the statement of Rabbi Oshaya: <b>Come and let us rely on the statement of Rabbi Shimon?</b> According <b>to Rabbi Shimon</b> the blood of slaughter <b>does not render</b> food items <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, while according <b>to Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> there is <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to the status of the gourd. The Gemara answers that with regard <b>to the matter of burning, in any event,</b> the opinions of Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>correspond to each other:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>does not burn</b> the gourd, because it was not rendered susceptible to impurity, <b>and</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya, <b>does not burn</b> the gourd, due to the uncertainty.
The result is that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that one burns the gourd since the blood of slaughter renders the gourd susceptible to ritual impurity and contact with a source of impurity renders it impure, <b>is one</b> Sage stating an individual opinion, <b>and the statement of one</b> Sage <b>has no</b> standing <b>in a place</b> where it is disputed by <b>two</b> Sages. <b>And this</b> is what Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>is saying:</b> In a case <b>such as this, one places</b> the matter <b>in abeyance; one may neither eat</b> the gourd <b>nor burn</b> it.
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to a dry <b>portion</b> of consecrated flour that was not mixed with the oil <b>of meal offerings,</b> does <b>one count</b> the descending levels of impurity characteristic of other foods that come into contact with a primary source of impurity, i.e., that food assumes <b>first-degree</b> impurity, <b>and</b> food that comes into contact with that food assumes <b>second-degree</b> impurity; <b>or</b> does one <b>not count</b> the descending levels of <b>first-degree</b> impurity <b>and second-degree</b> impurity? The Gemara elaborates: <b>When regard for sanctity is effective</b> in rendering an item susceptible to impurity, is it effective only <b>to disqualify</b> that item <b>itself, but to count</b> the descending levels of <b>first-degree and second-degree</b> impurity it is <b>not</b> effective? <b>Or perhaps</b> once it is rendered susceptible to impurity there <b>is no difference</b> whether it is rendered susceptible by means of regard for sanctity or by means of contact with liquids.
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>. It is written: <b>“Of all food that may be eaten,</b> on which water comes, it shall be impure; and all drink that may be drunk it shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). From that verse it is derived: <b>Food that comes into</b> contact with <b>water is rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity and to count the descending levels of impurity, but <b>food that does not come into</b> contact with <b>water is not rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. Apparently, for the dry portion of flour that did not come into contact with a liquid but was rendered susceptible by regard for sanctity, one does not count the descending levels of impurity.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish does not have</b> knowledge of the <i>halakha</i> that only <b>food that comes into</b> contact with <b>water</b> is susceptible to ritual impurity? The Gemara answers: <b>This is the dilemma</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish is raising:</b> Is the halakhic status of consecrated food that is subject to <b>regard for sanctity like</b> that of <b>food that comes into</b> contact with <b>water,</b> and one does not count the descending levels of impurity for items that come into contact with it, <b>or no,</b> its halakhic status is unique?
The Gemara explains that <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who cited the verse to resolve the dilemma of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, is not merely citing a verse that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish knows. Rather, he <b>too is stating</b> his proof <b>from the extraneous</b> formulation <b>of the verses. Since it is written: “But when water is placed upon the seed,</b> and any of their carcass falls upon it, it is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:38), <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“Of all food which may be eaten,</b> on which water comes, shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34)?

Daf 36b

Is it <b>not to exclude</b> items rendered susceptible to impurity due to <b>regard for sanctity?</b> The Gemara rejects that proof: <b>No,</b> both verses teach that food becomes impure only after it is rendered susceptible to impurity by one of the seven liquids. <b>One</b> verse is referring to <b>impurity</b> imparted by a <b>corpse, and one</b> verse is referring to <b>impurity</b> imparted by the carcass of <b>a creeping animal.</b>
<b>And</b> both verses <b>are necessary, as had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> the requirement of being rendered susceptible to impurity only with regard to <b>impurity</b> imparted by <b>a corpse,</b> one would have concluded that <b>it is there</b> that food <b>requires</b> being <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity by one of the seven liquids in order to become impure, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the impurity imparted by a corpse is less stringent, as a portion of a corpse the size of <b>a lentil-bulk does not render</b> people or vessels <b>impure. But</b> in the case of impurity imparted by the carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> which is more stringent, <b>as</b> the creeping animal <b>renders</b> people or vessels <b>impure</b> with a portion of it the size of <b>a lentil-bulk, say</b> that food <b>does not require</b> to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> by one of the seven liquids in order to become impure.
<b>And had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> the requirement of being rendered susceptible to impurity only with regard to impurity imparted by the carcass of <b>a creeping animal,</b> one would have concluded that it is there that food must be rendered susceptible to impurity, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the impurity imparted by a creeping animal is less stringent, as a creeping animal <b>does not render</b> people or vessels <b>impure</b> with <b>impurity</b> that lasts <b>seven</b> days. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a corpse, which renders</b> people or vessels <b>impure</b> with <b>impurity</b> that lasts <b>seven</b> days, <b>say</b> that food <b>does not require</b> to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> by one of the seven liquids in order to become impure from it. Therefore, <b>it is necessary</b> for the Torah to teach both verses.
<b>Rav Yosef raises an objection</b> from the mishna (33a) to Rabbi Elazar’s opinion that only with regard to food rendered susceptible by one of the seven liquids does one count the descending levels of impurity, i.e., first-degree impurity and second-degree impurity: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: They were rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>by means of</b> the <b>slaughter</b> itself. Rabbi Shimon is saying <b>they were rendered susceptible</b> in every sense, <b>and even to count</b> the descending levels of impurity, <b>first-degree</b> impurity <b>and second-degree</b> impurity.
<b>Why</b> is the animal rendered susceptible to impurity in every sense; <b>but</b> the slaughtered animal is <b>not food that comes into</b> contact with <b>water?</b> Apparently, even items that did not come into contact with water are susceptible to impurity in every sense. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: Rabbi Shimon holds that it is not susceptible by Torah law. Rather, the Sages <b>accorded</b> susceptibility via slaughter of the animal a status <b>like</b> that <b>of susceptibility rendered</b> by means of <b>water, by rabbinic law.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an objection to Rabbi Elazar’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who harvests</b> grapes in order to take them <b>to the winepress, Shammai says:</b> The grapes are <b>rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity by the liquid that seeps from them, and <b>Hillel says:</b> They are <b>not rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity; <b>and ultimately, Hillel was silent</b> and did not respond <b>to Shammai,</b> accepting his opinion. <b>Why</b> does that liquid render the grapes susceptible to impurity; <b>but</b> the grapes <b>are not food that comes into</b> contact with <b>water?</b> Contact with liquid renders food susceptible to impurity only if the contact was with the intent of the owner, and here, the liquid did not seep out of the grapes of one’s own volition. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: Hillel does not hold that the grapes are susceptible by Torah law; rather, the Sages <b>accorded</b> susceptibility via the liquid a status <b>like</b> that <b>of susceptibility rendered</b> by means of <b>water, by rabbinic law,</b> to count the descending levels of impurity, i.e., first-degree impurity, second-degree impurity.
<b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Abaye: <b>I said to you</b> an objection from the statement of Rabbi Shimon: <b>They were rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>by means of</b> the <b>slaughter</b> itself, <b>and you said to me:</b> It was the Sages who <b>accorded</b> susceptibility via slaughter of the animal a status <b>like</b> that <b>of susceptibility rendered</b> by means of <b>water. And Rabbi Zeira said to you</b> an objection from the case of one who harvests grapes, <b>and you said to him:</b> It is the Sages who <b>accorded</b> susceptibility via the liquid from the grapes a status <b>like</b> that <b>of susceptibility rendered</b> by means of <b>water.</b> If so, will you <b>also</b> say in response to the dilemma of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> with regard to a dry portion of consecrated flour that was not mixed with the oil of meal offerings that it is the Sages who <b>accorded</b> susceptibility via the regard for sanctity of the flour a status <b>like</b> that <b>of susceptibility rendered</b> by means of <b>water,</b> by rabbinic law, to count the descending levels of impurity, i.e., first-degree impurity, second-degree impurity?
Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish was raising a dilemma</b> with regard to <b>placing</b> the matter <b>in abeyance,</b> and one may neither eat the consecrated flour nor may one burn it, which would be the case for impurity by rabbinic law? <b>When</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>raises the dilemma</b> it is with regard to whether <b>to burn</b> the gourd, which is the case when the impurity is by Torah law.
The Gemara notes that it may be learned <b>by inference</b> that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish holds <b>that regard for sanctity</b> renders sacred items subject to ritual impurity <b>by Torah law,</b> as his dilemma was limited to whether one counts the descending levels of impurity from those susceptible items, i.e., first-degree impurity, second-degree impurity, not the impurity of the sacred item itself. <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is derived <b>from</b> that <b>which is written: “And the flesh that touches any impure</b> item shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire” (Leviticus 7:19), then it must be ascertained: <b>This flesh that was rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, <b>by what means</b> was it rendered susceptible?
<b>If we say that it was rendered susceptible</b> to impurity <b>by means of</b> the <b>blood</b> of the animal, this is difficult. <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to blood of sacrificial</b> animals <b>that it does not render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “You shall not eat it; you shall pour it upon the earth like water”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:24). <b>Blood</b> of a non-sacred animal, <b>which is poured like water</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>renders</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity. By contrast, blood of a sacrificial animal, <b>which is not poured like water</b> but is presented on the altar, <b>does not render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps say <b>that</b> the flesh <b>was rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>by means of the liquids of the</b> Temple <b>abattoir. But didn’t Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, say:</b> With regard to <b>the liquids of the</b> Temple <b>abattoir, not only are they ritually pure, but they do not</b> even <b>render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity. <b>And if you would say</b> that one should <b>explain</b> the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, as referring exclusively <b>to blood,</b> and the other liquids render food susceptible, <b>but doesn’t he say: Liquids,</b> in the plural? <b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not that</b> the flesh <b>was rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>via regard for sanctity?</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>And perhaps</b> the verse can be explained <b>in accordance with</b> the statement that <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Shmuel says, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The verse is referring to a case <b>where one had a cow</b> that was to be sacrificed as <b>a peace offering, and</b> since the owner is entitled to the meat and the hide of the animal, in order to improve their quality <b>he conveyed it through the river</b> and <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>while</b> the <b>liquid was still upon it</b> and the animal was <b>damp.</b> That liquid rendered the meat susceptible to impurity.
<b>Rather</b> the proof is <b>from the latter</b> portion of that verse: “And the flesh that touches any impure item shall not be eaten; it shall be burned with fire. <b>And the flesh,</b> every pure person may eat flesh” (Leviticus 7:19). The Gemara explains: The second mention of the term “and the flesh” in the verse is superfluous and serves <b>to include</b> the <i>halakha</i> that with regard to sacred <b>wood and frankincense,</b> impurity disqualifies them from being burned on the altar. Are <b>wood and frankincense edible</b> and therefore included in the verse: “Of all food that may be eaten, on which water comes, shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34)? <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish derived from this that <b>regard for sanctity renders</b> them <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>and renders their</b> status like that of <b>food. Here too,</b> in the case of a dry portion of flour that was not mixed with the oil of meal offerings, <b>regard for sanctity renders</b> it <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity.

Daf 37a

The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the resolution of the dilemma raised by Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: <b>When regard for sanctity is effective</b> in rendering an item susceptible to impurity, is it only <b>to disqualify</b> that item <b>itself, but to count</b> the descending levels of <b>first-degree</b> impurity <b>and second-degree</b> impurity, it is <b>not</b> effective; <b>or perhaps</b> once it is rendered susceptible to impurity there <b>is no difference</b> whether it is rendered susceptible by means of regard for sanctity or by means of contact with liquids? The Gemara answers: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>that is in danger</b> of imminent death, <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The slaughter is valid <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> after the slaughter <b>it convulses with its foreleg and with its hind leg. Rabbi Eliezer says: It is sufficient if</b> blood <b>spurted</b> from the neck. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters at night and the next day he awoke and found walls full of blood,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid,</b> as it is clear <b>that</b> the blood <b>spurted, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with the rule of Rabbi Eliezer. And the Rabbis say:</b> It is valid <b>only</b> in a case <b>where it convulses with its foreleg or with its hind leg, or</b> in a case <b>where it wags its tail.</b>
This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>both a small animal,</b> e.g., a sheep, <b>and a large animal,</b> e.g., a cow, that is in danger of imminent death. The slaughter of <b>a small animal that</b> when being slaughtered <b>extended its foreleg</b> that was bent <b>and did not restore</b> it to the bent position <b>is not valid, as</b> extending the foreleg <b>is only</b> part of the natural course of <b>removal</b> of the animal’s <b>soul</b> from its body and not a convulsion indicating life. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is in a case <b>where the presumptive status</b> of the animal <b>was</b> that it was <b>in danger</b> of imminent death. <b>But if its presumptive status was</b> that it was <b>healthy,</b> then <b>even if there were none of these indicators,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that</b> the flesh of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death <b>is permitted</b> by means of slaughter? The Gemara responds with a question: <b>And from where would it enter your mind that it is prohibited?</b> The Gemara explains that one may have thought it is prohibited, <b>as it is written: “These are the living beings [<i>haḥayya</i>] that you may eat</b> among all the animals that are on the earth” (Leviticus 11:2). One might have thought that the verse is saying: <b>Eat</b> an animal that is fit to <b>live [<i>ḥayya</i>], but do not eat</b> an animal <b>that is not</b> fit to <b>live. And this</b> animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death <b>is not</b> fit to <b>live.</b>
The fact that its meat is permitted is derived <b>from the fact that the Merciful One states that you shall not eat an unslaughtered animal carcass,</b> as it is written: “You shall not eat any unslaughtered carcass” (Deuteronomy 14:21); one learns <b>by inference</b> that eating the meat of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death <b>is permitted. As, if it enters your mind</b> that eating the meat of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death <b>is prohibited, now</b> if an animal is <b>prohibited while alive,</b> is it <b>necessary</b> to state that it is prohibited <b>after death?</b>
The Gemara rejects that proof. <b>And</b> that is not a legitimate inference, as <b>perhaps</b> the halakhic status of <b>an unslaughtered carcass is</b> the same as <b>that of</b> an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death, and the prohibition: “You shall not eat any unslaughtered carcass,” includes both. The Gemara answers: <b>It would not enter your mind</b> to say so, <b>as it is written: “And if any animal of which you may eat dies, one who touches its carcass</b> shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). This indicates that <b>it is after death that the Merciful One calls</b> the animal <b>a carcass; while alive,</b> the animal <b>is not called a carcass.</b>
The Gemara questions that understanding. <b>And perhaps, actually I will say to you:</b> The halakhic status of <b>an unslaughtered carcass is</b> the same as <b>that of</b> an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death, but if one slaughters the animal in danger of imminent death <b>while alive,</b> he would be <b>in</b> violation of <b>a positive</b> mitzva: “These are the living beings that you may eat” (Leviticus 11:2), whereas <b>after</b> its <b>death,</b> he would be <b>in</b> violation of <b>a prohibition:</b> “You shall not eat any unslaughtered carcass” (Deuteronomy 14:21).
<b>Rather,</b> the fact that its meat is permitted is derived <b>from the fact that the Merciful One states you shall not eat that an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> as it is written: “And you shall not eat any animal that was mauled in the field [<i>tereifa</i>]” (Exodus 22:30). From here, one learns <b>by inference</b> that eating the meat of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death <b>is permitted. As, if it enters your mind</b> that eating the meat of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death <b>is prohibited, now</b> that an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death <b>that is not lacking</b> any limb <b>is prohibited,</b> is it <b>necessary</b> to state that <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> an animal that was mauled and lacking body parts, is prohibited?
The Gemara rejects that proof. <b>And</b> that is not a legitimate inference, as <b>perhaps</b> the halakhic status of <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> that is lacking body parts <b>is</b> the same as that of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death that is not lacking body parts, and both are included in the category of <i>tereifa</i>. This would render one who slaughters either <b>to</b> be <b>in violation</b> of both <b>a positive</b> mitzva: “These are the living beings that you may eat,” <b>and a prohibition:</b> “And you shall not eat any animal that was mauled in the field [<i>tereifa</i>].” The Gemara questions that understanding: <b>If so, why do I</b> need the prohibition <b>that the Merciful One writes</b> with regard to <b>an unslaughtered carcass? If while</b> an animal is <b>alive one stands in</b> violation of <b>a prohibition and a positive</b> mitzva, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that it is prohibited <b>after death?</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>And</b> that is not a legitimate question, as <b>perhaps</b> the halakhic status of <b>an unslaughtered carcass is</b> the same as <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> that is lacking body parts, and <b>is</b> the same as <b>that of</b> an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death that is not lacking body parts. Therefore, when the Torah writes the word “carcass,” it is the same as though it had written <i>tereifa</i> and the same as though it had written an animal in danger of imminent death. The Torah prohibits each, <b>and the result will be that he will violate two prohibitions and a positive</b> mitzva.
<b>Rather,</b> the fact that the meat of an animal in danger of imminent death is permitted is derived <b>from here: “And the fat of a carcass and the fat of a <i>tereifa</i> may be used for any purpose; but you shall not eat it”</b> (Leviticus 7:24). <b>And the Master says:</b> In order <b>to</b> derive <b>what <i>halakha</i></b> is this verse written? Would one imagine that because it is an unslaughtered carcass or a <i>tereifa</i> its fat would be permitted for consumption? <b>The Torah states: Let the prohibition against</b> eating <b>an unslaughtered carcass come and take effect upon the prohibition against</b> eating forbidden <b>fat,</b> which already exists. One who eats the forbidden fat of an unslaughtered carcass is liable for violation of both prohibitions. Likewise, the word “<i>tereifa</i>” in the verse teaches: <b>Let the prohibition against</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i> come and take effect upon the prohibition against</b> eating forbidden <b>fat,</b> which already exists, so that one who eats the forbidden fat of a <i>tereifa</i> is liable for transgressing both prohibitions.

Daf 37b

<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that the halakhic status of <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> lacking body parts <b>is</b> the same as that of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death, <b>let the Merciful One write:</b> And <b>the fat of a carcass may be used for any purpose, and the fat of a <i>tereifa</i> you shall not eat.</b> The prohibition against eating the forbidden fat should have been written exclusively with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>and I would say: If while</b> an animal is <b>alive</b> and in danger of imminent death <b>the prohibition against</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i> takes effect upon the prohibition against</b> eating forbidden <b>fat, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that <b>after</b> its <b>death</b> the prohibition against eating an unslaughtered carcass takes effect upon the prohibition against eating forbidden fat?
The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather, from the fact that the Merciful One writes</b> that the prohibition against eating <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> takes effect upon the prohibition against eating forbidden fat, one learns <b>by inference that</b> the <b><i>tereifa</i></b> in the verse <b>is not the same as</b> an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death. Rather, the <i>tereifa</i> in the verse is an animal that was mauled and is lacking body parts, and it is only that animal that is prohibited after slaughter. Eating an animal in danger of imminent death after slaughter is permitted.
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi objects to this: And perhaps, actually I will say to you</b> that the halakhic status of <b>a <i>tereifa</i> is</b> the same as that of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>that which you said: Why do I</b> need the prohibition with regard to <b>an unslaughtered carcass that the Merciful One writes,</b> one can explain that it is necessary <b>for that unslaughtered carcass that does not come as a result of danger</b> of imminent death. <b>And what are the circumstances</b> of that unslaughtered carcass? It is in a case <b>where one rendered</b> the animal like <b>a shard,</b> by cutting it into two widthwise. The Gemara rejects that distinction: <b>There too,</b> in the case where one rendered the animal like a shard, it is <b>impossible that</b> the animal <b>was not</b> at least <b>somewhat in danger</b> of imminent death <b>before he cut the majority</b> of the animal.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that there is a different source for the fact that the meat of an animal in danger of imminent death is permitted. <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that an animal in danger of imminent death is included in the category of <i>tereifa</i>, <b>let</b> the verse <b>say: The fat of an unslaughtered carcass and a <i>tereifa</i>. Why do I</b> need it to be written: <b>“Fat</b> of a carcass and the <b>fat</b> of a <i>tereifa</i>”? The term “fat” is repeated to teach that <b>it is this</b> case <b>where</b> the status of <b>its fat is not distinct from</b> the status of <b>its meat,</b> and both are prohibited; <b>but you have another</b> case <b>where</b> the status of <b>its fat,</b> which is forbidden, <b>is distinct from</b> the status of <b>its meat,</b> which is permitted. <b>And which</b> case is that? <b>That is</b> the case of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived <b>from here: “Then I said: Ah, Lord God, my soul has not become impure; and from my youth until now I have not eaten an unslaughtered carcass or a <i>tereifa</i>, and no <i>piggul</i> flesh came into my mouth”</b> (Ezekiel 4:14).
The Gemara explains: <b>“My soul has not become impure”</b> means <b>that I did not consider</b> any sinful thoughts <b>during the day</b> that would cause me <b>to come to impurity</b> due to a seminal emission <b>at night. “And from my youth until now I have not eaten an unslaughtered carcass or a <i>tereifa</i>”</b> means <b>that I never ate</b> the <b>flesh of</b> an animal that was in danger of imminent death, leading one to say: <b>Slaughter</b> it, <b>slaughter</b> it quickly, before it dies. <b>“And no <i>piggul</i> flesh came into my mouth”</b> means <b>that I never ate from an animal</b> with regard to which there was uncertainty whether it is forbidden and <b>a Sage issued a ruling</b> to permit it. <b>They said in the name of Rabbi Natan</b> that the last portion of the verse means: <b>That I never ate from an animal whose gifts</b> to which members of the priesthood are entitled, i.e., the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw, <b>were not</b> already <b>separated.</b>
The proof is: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>it is permitted</b> to slaughter and eat an animal in imminent danger of death, then <b>that is the greatness of Ezekiel,</b> as, although eating it is permitted, he refrained from doing so. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>it is forbidden</b> to slaughter and eat that animal, <b>what</b> in that action attests to <b>the greatness of Ezekiel?</b> Apparently, it is permitted to slaughter and eat an animal in danger of imminent death.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> It is <b>any</b> animal with regard to <b>which one stands it</b> on its feet <b>but it does not stand</b> unaided. <b>Rav Ḥanina bar Shelamya in the name of Rav said:</b> That indicator is so clear that <b>even</b> if that animal maintains sufficient strength in its jaw and <b>eats pieces of wood,</b> if it is unable to stand, its status is that of an animal in danger of imminent death. <b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel said:</b> That is the case <b>even</b> if that animal <b>eats beams.</b>
<b>In Sura, they</b> would <b>teach</b> the exchange in <b>that</b> manner. <b>In Pumbedita, they</b> would <b>teach</b> the exchange in <b>this</b> manner: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> It is <b>any</b> animal with regard to <b>which one stands it</b> on its feet <b>but it does not stand</b> unaided, <b>even</b> if that animal maintains sufficient strength in its jaw and <b>eats pieces of wood. Rami bar Yeḥezkel said:</b> That indicator is so clear that <b>even</b> if that animal maintains sufficient strength in its jaw <b>and eats beams,</b> if it is unable to stand its status is that of an animal in danger of imminent death.
<b>Shmuel found students of Rav</b> after Rav’s death. <b>He said to them: What did Rav say with regard to</b> an animal <b>in danger</b> of imminent death? <b>They said to him: This</b> is what <b>Rav said:</b>

Daf 38a

If the animal <b>lows, or excreted excrement, or wiggled its ear</b> during the slaughter, <b>that is a convulsion,</b> and the slaughter renders eating the flesh of the animal permitted. Shmuel <b>said to them: Is it necessary</b> according <b>to Abba,</b> i.e., Rav, for the animal <b>to move its ears</b> during the slaughter, which requires a considerable life force? <b>As I say: Any</b> movements of the animal <b>that are not matters that the death</b> of the animal <b>engenders</b> are convulsions sufficient to render the slaughter valid.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are matters that the death</b> of the animal <b>engenders? Rav Anan said:</b> This <b>was explained to me from Master Shmuel</b> himself: If the animal’s <b>foreleg was bent, and</b> the animal <b>straightened it,</b> that is <b>a matter that the death</b> of the animal <b>engenders.</b> But if its foreleg was <b>straight and</b> the animal <b>bent</b> it, that is among the <b>matters that the death</b> of the animal <b>does not engender</b> and is a convulsion sufficient to render the slaughter valid.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Shmuel <b>teaching us</b> with that statement? <b>We</b> already <b>learn</b> in the mishna: The slaughter of <b>a small animal that</b> during its slaughter <b>extended its foreleg</b> that was bent <b>and did not restore</b> it to the bent position <b>is not valid, as</b> extending the foreleg <b>is nothing other than</b> part of the natural course of <b>removal</b> of the animal’s <b>soul</b> from its body and not a convulsion indicating life. <b>But</b> one may infer that if the animal does <b>restore</b> its foreleg to the bent position, that indicates life and the slaughter is <b>valid.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> is learned <b>from the mishna</b> alone, <b>I would say</b> that it is <b>specifically</b> in a case <b>where</b> the animal’s foreleg had been <b>bent, and</b> the animal now <b>straightens</b> it <b>and then bends it,</b> that the slaughter is valid. <b>But</b> if the foreleg had been <b>straight and</b> the animal <b>bent it,</b> the slaughter is <b>not</b> valid. Therefore, Shmuel <b>teaches us</b> that if its foreleg was straight and the animal bent it; that is a convulsion sufficient to render the slaughter valid.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> to Rav’s statement cited earlier. <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say:</b> If an animal <b>lows during its slaughter, that is not</b> a <b>convulsion</b> sufficient to render the slaughter valid. <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, says in</b> the <b>name</b> of Rabbi Yosei: <b>Even</b> if the animal <b>excreted excrement or wagged its tail, that is not</b> a <b>convulsion</b> sufficient to render the slaughter valid. The Gemara now clarifies: Rabbi Yosei’s statement in the <i>baraita</i> that if an animal <b>lows</b> it is not a convulsion sufficient to render the slaughter valid is <b>difficult,</b> as it contradicts the statement of Rav that if an animal <b>lows</b> it is a convulsion. And Rabbi Elazar’s statement in the <i>baraita</i> that if an animal excreted <b>excrement</b> it is not a convulsion sufficient to render the slaughter valid <b>is difficult,</b> as it contradicts the statement of Rav that if an animal excreted <b>excrement</b> it is a convulsion.
The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction between the opinion that when an animal <b>lows</b> it is a convulsion and the opinion that when an animal <b>lows</b> it is not a convulsion is <b>not difficult. This</b> opinion, that it is a convulsion, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the animal’s <b>voice</b> is <b>rich</b> and powerful, a clear indication of life; <b>that</b> opinion, that it is not a convulsion, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the animal’s <b>voice</b> is <b>muted,</b> which is not an indication of life. The apparent contradiction between the opinion that when an animal excreted <b>excrement</b> it is a convulsion and the opinion that when an animal excreted <b>excrement</b> it is not a convulsion is also <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the opinion that it is not a convulsion is referring to a case where the animal <b>expels</b> the excrement <b>in a trickle.</b> That is not an indication of life. <b>There,</b> the opinion that it is a convulsion is referring to a case where the animal <b>expels</b> the excrement <b>with force.</b> That is an indication of life.
§ The Gemara continues its definition of convulsion that indicates life. <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> I was taught that <b>the convulsion that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> is an indication of life is a convulsion <b>at the conclusion of</b> the act of <b>slaughter.</b> Rav Ḥisda elaborates: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>At the conclusion of</b> the act of <b>slaughter?</b> It means even <b>in the midst of the slaughter.</b> The Sages said that it must be at the conclusion of the slaughter only <b>to exclude</b> convulsions at <b>the beginning of</b> the act of <b>slaughter, which</b> are <b>not</b> an indication of life.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: From where do I say</b> that a convulsion in the midst of the act of slaughter is an indication of life? It is from the mishna, <b>as we learned:</b> The slaughter of <b>a small animal that</b> when being slaughtered <b>extended its foreleg</b> that was bent <b>and did not restore</b> it to the bent position <b>is not valid,</b> as extending the foreleg is only part of the natural course of removal of the animal’s soul from its body and not a convulsion indicating life. Rav Ḥisda elaborates: <b>When</b> did the animal extend its foreleg but not restore it? <b>If we say</b> that it occurred <b>at the conclusion of</b> the <b>slaughter, must</b> the animal <b>continue living</b> for <b>so extended</b> a period that it restores its leg to its bent position after the slaughter is complete? Is the slaughter truly not valid otherwise? <b>Rather, is it not</b> that the mishna is referring to a case where the animal extends its foreleg <b>in the middle of</b> the <b>slaughter?</b> If so, then when it restores its leg as well, it is considered a convulsion that indicates life.
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: That is no proof. <b>Actually,</b> one could explain that the mishna is referring to a case where the animal extends its foreleg but did not restore it to the bent position at <b>the conclusion of</b> the <b>slaughter, as I say</b> with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>that does not do so at the conclusion of</b> the <b>slaughter, it is known that its soul was taken from it before that</b> moment, and it was not alive.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The convulsion that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> is an indication of life is a convulsion even <b>at the beginning of</b> the act of <b>slaughter.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> explained further and <b>said: From where do I say</b> that this is so? It is from the mishna, <b>as we learned</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters at night and the next day</b> he awoke <b>and found walls full of blood,</b> the slaughter is <b>valid,</b> as it is clear <b>that</b> the blood <b>spurted, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with the rule of Rabbi Eliezer. And Shmuel said</b> with regard to the walls mentioned in the statement of Rabbi Shimon: It is <b>the walls of the place of the slaughter,</b> i.e., the walls of the neck, not the walls of the house, that <b>we learned. Granted, if you say</b> that a convulsion even <b>at the beginning of</b> the act of <b>slaughter</b> is an indication of life, this works out <b>well. But if you say</b> that a convulsion is an indication of life only <b>at the conclusion of</b> the act of <b>slaughter, let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the blood <b>spurted</b> onto the walls of the neck <b>at the beginning of</b> the act of <b>slaughter,</b> and there was no indication of life.
The Gemara rejects that proof. <b>But perhaps spurting is different, as</b> it is <b>superior</b> as an indication of life to extending or bending a foreleg, and therefore, although extending or bending a foreleg is a sufficient indicator of life only at the conclusion of the act of slaughter, spurting is a sufficient indicator even at the beginning of the act of slaughter.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> spurting <b>superior? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says it is sufficient if</b> blood <b>spurted</b> from the neck, indicating that spurting of blood is a less substantive indication of life than those indications mentioned in the statement of Rabban Gamliel, who requires that the animal convulse with its foreleg and with its hind leg? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Eliezer’s requirement of spurting is <b>less</b> substantive <b>than</b> the requirements <b>of Rabban Gamliel</b> as an indication of life, <b>but superior to</b> the requirement of <b>the Rabbis</b> as an indication of life, where the Rabbis require that the animal convulse either with its foreleg or with its hind leg.
<b>Ravina said: Samma bar Ḥilkai said to me</b> that <b>the father of bar Abuveram, and some say</b> that it was <b>the brother of bar Abuveram, raises a difficulty: And is</b> blood spurting <b>superior to</b> the requirement of <b>the Rabbis</b> as an indication of life? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> It is permitted <b>only</b> in a case <b>where it convulses with its foreleg or with its hind leg,</b> or in a case where it wags its tail?
Ravina elaborates: <b>To which</b> statement of the <i>tanna’im</i> in the mishna <b>do the Rabbis stand</b> and respond? <b>If we say</b> that they are responding to the statement <b>of Rabban Gamliel,</b> who requires that the animal convulse with its foreleg and with its hind leg, the Rabbis <b>should</b> have said: <b>Once</b> the animal <b>convulsed</b> with its foreleg or with its hind leg or it wagged its tail, indicating that this is sufficient.
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the Rabbis are responding to the statement <b>of Rabbi Eliezer. And if</b> Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion is <b>superior</b> to that of the Rabbis as an indication of life, <b>what</b> is the meaning of: It is permitted <b>only</b> in a case where it convulses with its foreleg or with its hind leg or it wags its tail? In that case too, the Rabbis should have said: Once the animal convulses with its foreleg or with its hind leg or it wags its tail. Apparently, blood spurting is a less substantive indication of life, and the proof of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak remains valid: If spurting at the beginning of the act of slaughter is a sufficient indication of life to render the slaughter valid, then all the more so, extending and bending a limb are also sufficient indications of life.
<b>Rava said: The convulsion that</b> the Rabbis <b>said</b> is an indication of life is a convulsion <b>at the conclusion of</b> the act of <b>slaughter. Rava said: From where do I say</b> that this is the case? It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall be seven days under its mother; and from the eighth day and onward it may be accepted for an offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27). The phrase <b>“a bull</b>

Daf 38b

<b>or a sheep”</b> is <b>to the exclusion of</b> an animal born to parents of <b>diverse kinds,</b> which may not be brought as an offering. The phrase <b>“or a goat”</b> is <b>to the exclusion of</b> an animal <b>that resembles</b> another species of animal. <b>“When it is born”;</b> this is <b>to the exclusion of</b> an animal <b>born by caesarean section.</b> “It shall be <b>seven days”;</b> this is <b>to the exclusion of</b> an animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived. <b>“Under its mother”;</b> this is <b>to the exclusion of</b> an animal that is <b>an orphan.</b>
Rava elaborates: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this orphan? If we say that its mother gave birth to it and then died,</b> this is unreasonable. Will the mother <b>continue living forever? Rather,</b> perhaps the reference is to a case <b>where</b> the mother <b>died and then gave birth to it.</b> The Gemara rejects that possibility, as the fact that this animal is disqualified from sacrifice <b>is derived from</b> the phrase: <b>“When it is born,”</b> since after the mother’s death the newborn animal can emerge from the womb only by means of caesarean section.
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the reference is to a case where the mother died at the conclusion of the birth, at which point <b>this</b> mother <b>withdrew for death and that</b> newborn <b>withdrew for life. Granted, if you say</b> that <b>we require life at the conclusion of</b> the <b>birth, that is why a verse was necessary to exclude</b> the orphan. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>we do not require life at the conclusion of the birth,</b> and the verse is excluding only an animal that was born after its mother’s death, <b>why is</b> this verse necessary to exclude it? It can <b>be derived from</b> the phrase: <b>“When it is born.”</b> It may be derived from here that in any situation where the animal must be alive, it must remain alive until the end of the process. That is the case with regard to the slaughter of an animal in danger of imminent death as well. The slaughter is valid only if there is an indication of life at the end of the act of slaughter.
§ The mishna teaches: The slaughter of a small animal in danger of imminent death that during the slaughter extended its foreleg that was bent and did not restore it to the bent position is not valid, as extending the foreleg is only part of the natural course of removal of the animal’s soul from its body and not a convulsion indicating life. <b>Rava says</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion expressed in <b>this <i>baraita</i>:</b> The slaughter of <b>a small animal that extended its foreleg</b> that was bent <b>and did not restore it</b> to the bent position <b>is not valid.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is <b>with regard to the foreleg. But with regard to the hind leg, whether</b> the animal <b>extended it and did not restore</b> it to the bent position <b>or</b> the animal <b>bent it but did not extend it,</b> the slaughter <b>is valid. In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> about extending the foreleg, <b>said?</b> It is <b>with regard to a small</b> animal. <b>But with regard to a large</b> animal, <b>whether</b> the convulsion involves its <b>foreleg or its hind leg,</b> and <b>whether</b> the animal <b>extended it and did not restore</b> it to the bent position <b>or</b> the animal <b>bent it but did not extend it,</b> the slaughter <b>is valid. And</b> with regard to <b>a bird, even</b> if it <b>fluttered [<i>rifref</i>] only its wing or wagged only its tail, that is a convulsion</b> and an indication of life.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rava <b>teaching us</b> in ruling in accordance with the <i>baraita</i>? He is teaching us <b>all of</b> those <i>halakhot</i> <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: The slaughter of <b>a small animal that</b> when being slaughtered <b>extended its foreleg</b> that was bent <b>and did not restore</b> it to the bent position <b>is not valid, as</b> extending the foreleg <b>is only</b> part of the natural course of <b>removal</b> of the animal’s <b>soul</b> from its body and not a convulsion indicating life. It may be inferred from the mishna that with regard to movement of <b>a foreleg</b> alone, <b>yes,</b> it is not an indication of life, but movement of <b>a hind leg, no,</b> it is an indication of life. With regard to <b>a small</b> animal, <b>yes,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i>; with regard to <b>a large</b> animal, <b>no,</b> this is not the <i>halakha</i>, and extending a hind leg does indicate life. The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary for</b> Rava to teach the <i>halakha</i> in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to <b>a bird, as we did not learn</b> it in the mishna.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a Jew <b>who slaughters</b> the animal of a gentile <b>for a gentile, his slaughter is valid, and Rabbi Eliezer deems it not valid. Rabbi Eliezer says: Even if</b> the Jew <b>slaughtered</b> the animal with the intent <b>to feed the gentile from its diaphragm [<i>meḥatzar kaved</i>],</b> its slaughter is <b>not valid, as the unspecified intent of a gentile is</b> to slaughter the animal <b>for idol worship,</b> and it is prohibited to derive benefit from it.
<b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The <b>matter</b> of the intent of the gentile is irrelevant in this case, as can be derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. <b>If in a place where intent</b> while slaughtering the animal <b>invalidates</b> the slaughter, i.e., <b>in sacrificial</b> animals, such as when slaughtering an offering with the intent to sacrifice it beyond its designated time, <b>everything follows only</b> the intent of the priest <b>performing the service</b> and not the intent of the owner, then <b>in a place where intent does not invalidate</b> the slaughter, i.e., <b>in non-sacred</b> animals, <b>is it not right that everything should follow only</b> the intent of <b>the one who slaughters</b> the animal?
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> In explanation of the dispute between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Eliezer, the Gemara explains: <b>These <i>tanna’im</i> hold</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, says: I heard that the owners,</b> and not only the priest, <b>render</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i></b> by means of improper intent. The same is true with regard to non-sacred slaughter, where the owners’ intent for idol worship invalidates the slaughter, even if the slaughterer has no intent for idol worship.
<b>But the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>if we heard</b> the gentile say <b>that he intends</b> the animal for idol worship, <b>yes,</b> his intent invalidates the slaughter, and <b>if</b> the gentile did <b>not</b> voice his intent before us, his intent does <b>not</b> invalidate the slaughter, as <b>we do not say</b> that the <b>unspecified intent of a gentile is for idol worship. Rabbi Eliezer holds: Although we did not hear</b> the gentile say <b>that he intends</b> the animal for idol worship, the slaughter is not valid, as <b>we say</b> the <b>unspecified intent of a gentile is for idol worship. And Rabbi Yosei comes to say</b> that <b>even though we heard</b> the gentile say <b>that he intends</b> the animal for idol worship, in a case where <b>this</b> owner <b>has intent</b> for idol worship <b>and that</b> other person is <b>performing</b> the slaughter, <b>we do not say</b> that the intent of the owner invalidates the slaughter.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> an alternative explanation of the mishna. It is <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where we heard</b> the gentile say <b>that he intends</b> the animal for idol worship that the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree. The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>when we say</b> in a case where <b>this</b> owner <b>has</b> improper <b>intent and that</b> other person is <b>performing</b> the slaughter that the intent of the owner invalidates the slaughter, <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>inside</b> the Temple, in the slaughter of offerings. <b>But</b> with regard to non-sacred slaughter <b>outside</b> the Temple, the intent of the owner does <b>not</b> invalidate the slaughter, as with regard to deriving the <i>halakhot</i> of non-sacred slaughter <b>outside</b> the Temple <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter of sacrificial animals <b>inside</b> the Temple,

Daf 39a

<b>we do not derive</b> in this manner. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer comes to say</b> that <b>we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of non-sacred slaughter <b>outside</b> the Temple <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter of sacrificial animals <b>inside</b> the Temple, and therefore the intent of the gentile invalidates non-sacred slaughter. <b>And Rabbi Yosei comes to say</b> that <b>even inside</b> the Temple, in a case where <b>this</b> owner <b>has</b> improper <b>intent and that</b> other person is <b>performing</b> the slaughter, <b>we do not say</b> that the intent of the owner invalidates the slaughter.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that there is an amoraic dispute with regard to <b>one who slaughtered an animal</b> in order <b>to sprinkle its blood for idol worship, or to burn its fat for idol worship. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The slaughter is <b>not valid,</b> and benefit from the animal is forbidden. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> The slaughter is valid and deriving benefit from the animal is <b>permitted.</b>
The Gemara elaborates. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The slaughter is <b>not valid</b> and benefit from the animal is forbidden. He holds that <b>one transfers intent from</b> one sacrificial <b>rite to</b> another sacrificial <b>rite.</b> If, while slaughtering a sacrificial animal, one intends to perform one of the other sacrificial rites in an improper manner the offering is invalidated. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that <b>we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of non-sacred slaughter <b>outside</b> the Temple <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter of sacrificial animals <b>inside</b> the Temple. Since that intent invalidates the slaughter of sacrificial animals inside the Temple, it invalidates the slaughter of non-sacred animals outside the Temple as well.
<b>Reish Lakish says:</b> The slaughter is valid, and deriving benefit from the animal is <b>permitted.</b> He holds that <b>one does not transfer intent from</b> one sacrificial <b>rite to</b> another sacrificial <b>rite.</b> Therefore, while slaughtering the animal, only intent to perform the slaughter improperly invalidates the offering, but intent to perform another sacrificial rite improperly does not invalidate the offering. <b>And</b> Reish Lakish holds that <b>we do not derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of non-sacred slaughter <b>outside</b> the Temple <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter of sacrificial animals <b>inside</b> the Temple.
<b>And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish <b>follow their</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as it was stated:</b> If one <b>slaughtered</b> a sin offering <b>for its own sake,</b> but with intent <b>to sprinkle its blood not for its own sake</b> but for the sake of another type of offering, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the offering is <b>unfit,</b> and <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says</b> that the offering is <b>fit.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the offering is <b>unfit.</b> He holds that <b>one transfers intent from</b> one sacrificial <b>rite to</b> another sacrificial <b>rite, and</b> the reason is that <b>we derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of slaughter of a sin offering not for its sake <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>intent for <i>piggul</i>,</b> i.e., performance of one of the sacrificial rites with the intent to sprinkle the blood of the offering beyond its appointed time. And <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says</b> that the offering is <b>fit</b> because he holds that <b>one does not transfer intent from</b> one sacrificial <b>rite to</b> another sacrificial <b>rite, and</b> the reason is that <b>we do not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of any other improper intent <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>intent for <i>piggul</i>.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish in both cases. <b>As, if</b> it <b>were stated</b> only <b>with regard to that</b> case of one who slaughters an animal in order to sprinkle its blood for idol worship, perhaps one would conclude that it is specifically <b>in that</b> case that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish states</b> his opinion that the slaughter is valid, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that we do not derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of non-sacred slaughter <b>outside</b> the Temple <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter of sacrificial animals <b>inside</b> the Temple. <b>But</b> in the case of one who slaughters an offering for the sake of another offering, where we would be deriving the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter of sacrificial animals <b>inside</b> the Temple <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of another case of slaughter of sacrificial animals <b>inside</b> the Temple, <b>say</b> that Reish Lakish <b>concedes to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that the offering is unfit.
<b>And if</b> their dispute <b>was stated with regard to this</b> case of one who slaughters an offering for the sake of another offering, perhaps one would conclude that it is specifically <b>in this</b> case that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that the offering is unfit, because he holds that one derives the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter of sacrificial animals inside the Temple from the <i>halakhot</i> of another case of slaughter of sacrificial animals inside the Temple. <b>But in that</b> case of one who slaughters an animal in order to sprinkle its blood for idol worship, <b>say that</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>concedes to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> that the offering is fit due to the fact that the <i>halakhot</i> of non-sacred slaughter outside the Temple are not derived from the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughter of sacrificial animals inside the Temple. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to state the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish in both cases.
<b>Rav Sheshet raises an objection</b> to both Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish from the statement in the mishna with regard to one who slaughters for a gentile when the intent of the gentile is for idol worship. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The <b>matter</b> of the intent of the gentile is irrelevant in this case as can be derived by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. <b>If in a place where intent</b> while slaughtering the animal <b>invalidates</b> the slaughter, i.e., <b>in sacrificial</b> animals, such as when slaughtering an offering with the intent to sacrifice it beyond its designated time, <b>everything follows only</b> the intent of the priest <b>performing the service</b> and not the intent of the owner, then <b>in a place where intent does not invalidate</b> the slaughter, i.e., <b>in non-sacred</b> animals, <b>is it not right that everything should follow only</b> the intent of <b>the one who slaughters</b> the animal?
Rav Sheshet elaborates: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Intent does not invalidate</b> the slaughter <b>in non-sacred</b> animals? <b>If we say</b> that it means <b>that</b> intent <b>does not invalidate</b> the slaughter of non-sacred animals <b>at all, but</b> then <b>how can you find</b> a case of <b>slaughter</b> with intent <b>for idol worship where</b> the animal <b>is forbidden?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the meaning of that phrase in the statement of Rabbi Yosei is that one does not transfer intent <b>from</b> one sacrificial <b>rite to</b> another sacrificial <b>rite, and this</b> is what Rabbi Yosei <b>is saying: If in a place where intent invalidates,</b> i.e., <b>in sacrificial</b> animals, <b>from</b> one sacrificial <b>rite to</b> another sacrificial <b>rite, everything follows only</b> the intent of the one <b>performing</b> the slaughter, and the intent of the owners is irrelevant, in a <b>place where intent does not invalidate,</b> i.e., <b>in non-sacred</b> animals, <b>from</b> one <b>rite to</b> another <b>rite</b> but it does so <b>only within the same rite, is it not right that everything should follow only</b> the intent of <b>the one who slaughters</b> the animal?
According to this understanding of the contention of Rabbi Yosei in the mishna, the case of the slaughter of a sacrificial animal <b>inside</b> the Temple is <b>difficult for Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> as contrary to his opinion, Rabbi Yosei says that in that case one transfers intent from one sacrificial rite to another sacrificial rite. The case of slaughter of a non-sacred animal <b>outside</b> the Temple is <b>difficult for Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> as contrary to his opinion, Rabbi Yosei says that in that case one does not transfer intent from one rite to another rite.
Rav Sheshet continues: <b>Granted,</b> the case of <b>inside</b> the Temple is <b>not difficult for Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> because one can explain that he stated <b>this</b> statement that one does not transfer intent from one sacrificial rite to another sacrificial rite before <b>he heard</b> the mishna <b>from Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> his teacher, and he stated <b>that</b> one transfers intent from one sacrificial rite to another sacrificial rite <b>after he heard</b> the mishna <b>from Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> His dispute with Rabbi Yoḥanan is limited to transfer of intent for idol worship from rite to rite. <b>But</b> the case of slaughter of a non-sacred animal <b>outside</b> the Temple <b>is difficult for Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>
Rav Sheshet <b>raises the objection, and he resolves it.</b> That which Rabbi Yosei said, that intent inside the Temple disqualifies the slaughter of a sacrificial animal but intent outside the Temple does not disqualify the slaughter of a non-sacred animal, is unrelated to transfer of intent from one rite to another. Rather, Rabbi Yosei is referring to a case where one performed any <b>of the four</b> sacrificial <b>rites</b> with improper intent, e.g., to eat the offering beyond its appointed time. <b>And this</b> is what Rabbi Yosei <b>is saying: If in a place where intent</b> while slaughtering the animal <b>invalidates</b> the slaughter <b>in sacrificial</b> animals, if that intent was <b>during</b> performance of any of the <b>four</b> sacrificial <b>rites,</b> i.e., slaughter, receiving the blood, conveying the blood to the altar, and sprinkling the blood on the altar, <b>everything follows only</b> the intent of the priest <b>performing the service</b> and not the intent of the owner,

Daf 39b

then <b>in a place where intent invalidates</b> the slaughter <b>in non-sacred</b> animals slaughtered with intent for idol worship <b>during</b> performance of <b>only two</b> sacrificial <b>rites,</b> slaughter and sprinkling the blood, <b>is it not right that everything should follow only</b> the intent of <b>the one who slaughters</b> the animal?
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughters an animal</b> in order <b>to sprinkle its blood for idol worship</b> or <b>to burn its fat for idol worship,</b> the status of <b>these</b> animals <b>is</b> that of <b>offerings to the dead,</b> i.e., to idols, and the slaughter is not valid. <b>If one slaughtered</b> the animal <b>and thereafter intended in its</b> regard to sprinkle its blood or burn its fats for idol worship, <b>that was</b> the <b>incident in Caesarea, and</b> the Sages <b>did not say</b> anything <b>with regard to</b> the animal, <b>neither prohibition nor permission.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> in explanation of the conduct of the Sages that <b>they did not say prohibition, due to the honor of the Rabbis</b> in the mishna, who hold that the unspecified intent of a gentile, and presumably likewise of a Jew who worships idols, is not presumed to be directed to idol worship, and therefore his slaughter is valid. <b>Nor</b> did the Sages say <b>permission, due to the honor of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who holds that the unspecified intent of a gentile, and presumably likewise of a Jew who worships idols, is presumed to be directed to idol worship.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is that conclusion drawn? <b>Perhaps the Rabbis say</b> that the slaughter is permitted <b>only there</b> in the mishna, <b>because we did not hear</b> explicitly <b>that</b> the gentile <b>intends</b> the slaughter for idol worship. <b>But here</b> in the case in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>where we hear</b> thereafter <b>that he intends</b> to sprinkle the blood or burn the fats for idol worship, perhaps <b>his ultimate</b> statement <b>proves</b> the nature of <b>his original</b> intent while performing the slaughter.
<b>Alternatively,</b> perhaps when <b>Rabbi Eliezer states there</b> in the mishna that slaughter performed on behalf of a gentile is not valid, this applies <b>only with regard to</b> an animal that is owned by <b>a gentile, as the unspecified intent of a gentile is directed to idol worship. But</b> in the case in the <i>baraita</i> where the animal belongs to <b>a Jew, we do not say</b> that <b>his ultimate</b> statement <b>proves</b> the nature of <b>his original</b> intent.
<b>Rather, Rav Sheizevi said</b> that the Sages <b>did not state permission with regard to</b> the animal in the <i>baraita</i> <b>due to the honor of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> who holds that one’s ultimate actions prove the nature of his original intent. The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> statement of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> indicates that this is his opinion?
<b>If we say</b> that the reference is to the statement of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to bills of divorce,</b> this is difficult. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 66a) that if a dying man said to the people present: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, those people should write and deliver the bill of divorce to his wife. Although the delivery was not included in his command, that is clearly his intent. But <b>a healthy</b> man <b>who says: Write a bill of divorce for my wife,</b> but did not say: Deliver it to her, presumably <b>sought to mock her</b> and not to designate his listeners as agents of delivery.
The mishna continues: <b>And</b> there was <b>an incident involving a healthy</b> man <b>who said: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, and</b> then <b>ascended to the roof and fell, and died. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If he fell at his own</b> initiative, taking his own life, <b>it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce,</b> as it is clear that he anticipated his death, thereby rendering his halakhic status like that of a dying man. But <b>if the wind forced him</b> to fall and he died, <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce,</b> as there was no clear intent to give her the bill of divorce.
<b>And we discussed</b> the mishna: Did the <i>tanna</i> cite <b>an incident to contradict</b> that which was stated previously in the mishna? The <i>tanna</i> states unequivocally that when a healthy man says: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, the bill of divorce is not valid. The <i>tanna</i> then cites an incident indicating that under certain circumstances, when a healthy man says: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, the bill of divorce is valid.
The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> The healthy man who says: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, but did not say: Deliver it to her, presumably sought to mock her. But <b>if his ultimate</b> actions <b>prove</b> the nature of <b>his initial</b> intent, that he seeks to give the bill of divorce because he is about to die, <b>it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce. And</b> there was <b>an incident involving a healthy</b> man <b>who said: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, and</b> then <b>ascended to the roof and fell, and died. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: If he fell at his own</b> initiative, <b>it is</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce,</b> but <b>if the wind forced him</b> to fall, <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>bill of divorce.</b>
The Gemara explains why this is not a proof: <b>But perhaps</b> the case cited <b>there is different, as</b> the husband initially <b>says: Write</b> a bill of divorce for my wife, indicating that he originally intended to fall from the roof. By contrast, in the case of slaughter, there is no indication of his original intent.
<b>Rather, Ravina said</b> that the Sages did not state permission in the incident in Caesarea with regard to the animal <b>due to the honor of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> to avoid contradicting the opinion <b>that</b> is cited <b>here, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case of a person on his deathbed <b>who wrote</b> a document transferring <b>his property to others, and there were slaves among</b> his property, <b>and that</b> intended recipient <b>says: I do not want</b> to assume ownership of the slaves, <b>if their second master,</b> the intended recipient, <b>was a priest, these</b> slaves <b>may partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> and his protest is ignored. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Once that</b> intended recipient <b>says: I do not want</b> to assume ownership of the slaves, <b>heirs</b> of the original owner <b>already acquired them.</b>
<b>And we discussed</b> the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> according <b>to the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> does the intended recipient acquire the slaves <b>even</b> if <b>he stands and shouts</b> in protest that he does not want to assume ownership of the slaves? That is not reasonable.
<b>Rabba said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who said: <b>In</b> a case where <b>he shouts</b> in protest <b>at the outset,</b> while the owner is giving him the gift, <b>everyone agrees that he did not acquire</b> the slaves. In a case where <b>he was silent</b> at that moment <b>and ultimately shouted</b> his protest at a later opportunity, <b>everyone agrees that he acquired</b> the slaves.
<b>When they disagree</b> it is in a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>transferred ownership</b> of the slaves <b>to him through another</b> person, <b>and</b> at that point the recipient <b>was silent, and ultimately,</b> when he actually received the slaves, <b>he shouted</b> in protest. <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds: Since he was</b> initially <b>silent, he acquired</b> the slaves, <b>and</b> the fact <b>that he is</b> ultimately <b>shouting</b> indicates that <b>he is retracting</b> his initial acceptance of the gift. That retraction is ineffective, as acquisitions cannot be nullified in that manner.
<b>And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds: His ultimate</b> actions <b>prove</b> the nature of <b>his original</b> intent. He never wanted the slaves and always intended to avoid assuming ownership of them. <b>And</b> the fact <b>that he did not shout initially</b> is because <b>he thought:</b> As the situation is <b>that they did not</b> yet <b>enter my possession, why would I shout?</b>
§ The Gemara resumes discussion of the dispute in the mishna where Rabbi Yosei says that when a Jew slaughters an animal on behalf of a gentile, even if it is known that the intent of the gentile is for idol worship, the slaughter is valid, as it is only the intent of the slaughterer that is relevant. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>
The Gemara relates: There were <b>these Arabs who came to Tzikuneya,</b> and <b>they gave rams to Jewish slaughterers.</b> The Arabs <b>said to them: The blood and the fat are for us,</b> for use in our idol worship, and <b>the hide and the flesh are for you. Rav Tuvi bar Rav Mattana sent</b> a question to be asked <b>before Rav Yosef:</b> In <b>a case like this, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Yosef <b>sent to him: This</b> is what <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> and it is the intent of the slaughterer and not the intent of the owner that determines the validity of the slaughter.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi:</b> According <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> in the mishna, that if a Jew slaughters an animal on behalf of a gentile the slaughter is not valid, if the gentile <b>gave a dinar to a Jewish slaughterer</b> in order to purchase a small amount of the meat, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does that small amount invalidate the entire slaughter? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: We examine</b> the situation. <b>If</b> this gentile <b>is a violent man, and</b> the Jew <b>is unable</b> to <b>repudiate his</b> offer and tell him to take his money, the entire animal is <b>forbidden,</b> because the slaughter was partially on behalf of the gentile. <b>And if</b> the gentile is <b>not</b> violent, the Jew can <b>say to him:</b> Go and arrange a collision between <b>your head and a mountain,</b> as I will not slaughter an animal on your behalf.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>for the sake of,</b> i.e., to worship, <b>mountains, for the sake of hills, for the sake of seas, for the sake of rivers,</b> or <b>for the sake of wildernesses, his slaughter is not valid.</b>

Daf 40a

If there were <b>two</b> people <b>grasping a knife</b> together <b>and slaughtering</b> an animal, <b>one</b> slaughtering <b>for the sake of one of all those</b> enumerated in the first clause of the mishna <b>and one</b> slaughtering <b>for the sake of a legitimate matter,</b> their <b>slaughter is not valid.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that if one slaughters for the sake of mountains or other natural entities the slaughter is unfit. The Gemara infers: It is <b>unfit, yes;</b> with regard to <b>offerings to the dead,</b> i.e., to idols, it is <b>not</b> in that category. Apparently, the status of the animal is that of an unslaughtered carcass, from which benefit is permitted, and not that of an idolatrous offering, from which benefit is forbidden. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who slaughters for the sake of mountains, for the sake of hills, for the sake of rivers, for the sake of wildernesses, for the sake of the sun and moon, for the sake of stars and constellations, for the sake of Michael the great ministering angel,</b> or even <b>for the sake of a small worm, these are offerings to the dead,</b> from which benefit is forbidden.
<b>Abaye said:</b> The apparent contradiction between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> is <b>not difficult. This</b> mishna that teaches that the slaughter is not valid but benefit is permitted is referring to a case <b>where one says</b> that he is slaughtering the animal for the sake <b>of the mountain</b> itself, which is not an idol. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> that teaches that the animal is an offering to the dead and benefit is forbidden is referring to a case <b>where one says</b> that he is slaughtering the animal for the sake <b>of the angel of the mountain.</b> The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as</b> the mountain and the other natural entities <b>are taught</b> together with and therefore <b>similar to Michael, the great ministering angel. Conclude from it</b> that the <i>tanna</i> is referring to slaughter for the sake of a spiritual entity, not the mountain itself.
<b>Rav Huna says: If the animal of another was prone before an idol, once one cut one <i>siman</i>,</b> the windpipe or the gullet, <b>he rendered</b> the animal <b>forbidden. He holds in accordance with that which Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Although</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one who bows to the animal of another does not render it forbidden,</b> if <b>he performed</b> a sacrificial <b>rite upon it he renders it forbidden.</b> The case cited by Rav Huna involves an action of that kind, cutting one <i>siman</i>; therefore, the animal is forbidden.
<b>Rav Naḥman raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who</b> unwittingly <b>slaughters</b> an animal that was designated as <b>a sin offering on Shabbat outside</b> the Temple, <b>for idol worship, is liable</b> to bring <b>three sin offerings:</b> One for performing the prohibited labor of slaughtering on Shabbat, one for slaughtering a sacrificial animal outside the Temple, and one for slaughtering an animal for idol worship. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>once he cuts one <i>siman</i> he renders</b> the animal <b>forbidden</b> as an idolatrous offering, then <b>let him not be liable</b> to bring a sin offering <b>for slaughter</b> of a sacrificial animal <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard,

Daf 40b

as it is as though <b>he is</b> merely <b>chopping in dirt,</b> since one is not liable for slaughtering outside the Temple courtyard a sacrificial animal unfit for sacrifice. <b>Rav Pappa said: Here we are dealing with a bird sin offering,</b> for which the requirement is to cut only one <i>siman</i>, and when cutting that <i>siman</i>, <b>all of</b> the three prohibitions <b>come</b> to be violated <b>simultaneously.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Now in accordance with whose</b> opinion did <b>Rav Huna state his <i>halakha</i>?</b> It is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Ulla,</b> who says: If he performed a sacrificial rite upon the animal, he renders it forbidden. <b>And Ulla says</b> that <b>a minimal action</b> renders the animal forbidden, as his ruling applies even to cutting one <i>siman</i>. According to Ulla’s opinion, the moment that he begins the incision, the animal is forbidden and unfit to be sacrificed. Consequently, when he completes the slaughter outside the Temple, it is as though he is chopping dirt. Why then is he liable to bring a sin offering for slaughter of a sacrificial animal outside the Temple courtyard?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where one says</b> prior to the slaughter that <b>he is worshipping</b> the idol only <b>at the conclusion of the slaughter;</b> therefore, only then is the animal rendered forbidden, and one is liable for all three sin offerings simultaneously.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>specifically</b> with regard to <b>a sin offering? Let him teach us</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to any type of <b>offering.</b> According to Rav Pappa, by contrast, it is clear why the <i>tanna</i> taught the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a sin offering.
The Gemara returns to Rav Pappa’s interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> as referring to the case of a bird sin offering. The previous difficulty then resurfaces, that the bird was rendered forbidden before the slaughter was completed, as according to Rav Huna and Ulla any minimal action renders the bird forbidden. <b>Rather, Mar Zutra said in the name of Rav Pappa: What are we dealing with here</b> in the <i>baraita</i>? It is a case <b>where half of the windpipe was deficient</b> before the slaughter, <b>and</b> the slaughterer <b>added to</b> that deficiency an incision of <b>any size, and completed it.</b> The minority of the windpipe had been cut before the slaughterer cut it further, completing the act of slaughter. <b>As</b> in that case <b>all of</b> the three prohibitions <b>come</b> to be violated <b>simultaneously.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said: If not</b> for the fact <b>that Rav Huna said</b> that it is sufficient to cut <b>one <i>siman</i></b> on the animal for idol worship to render it forbidden, the fact that the <i>baraita</i> mentions <b>a sin offering</b> specifically <b>would not raise a difficulty for his</b> opinion. In that case, one could explain: <b>What</b> is <b>the action</b> that renders the animal forbidden according to Ulla? It is <b>a significant action,</b> i.e., completion of the slaughter for idol worship, that renders the animal forbidden.
<b>And Rav Pappa said: If not</b> for the fact <b>that Rav Huna stated</b> his <i>halakha</i> specifically with regard to the <b>animal of another,</b> the fact that the <i>baraita</i> mentions specifically <b>a sin offering would not raise a difficulty for his</b> opinion. One could then explain: <b>What is the reason</b> that the animal designated as a sin offering is not rendered forbidden at the beginning of the slaughter? It is due to the fact that <b>one is able to render his</b> animal <b>forbidden,</b> but <b>one is not able to render</b> the animal <b>of another forbidden.</b> It is the priests who are entitled to derive benefit from the flesh of a sin offering.
The Gemara objects: That is <b>obvious.</b> The Gemara explains: Rav Pappa needs to state this, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>since</b> one who brings a sin offering <b>acquires</b> the animal <b>for his atonement,</b> its status is <b>like</b> that of an animal that <b>is his.</b> Therefore, Rav Pappa <b>teaches us</b> that this does not suffice that the animal be considered his.
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the names of the <i>amora’im</i> who participate in the discussion that ensues: <b><i>Nun</i>,</b> Rav Naḥman; <b><i>ayin</i>,</b> Rav Amram; <b><i>tzadi</i>,</b> Rav Yitzḥak. <b>Rav Naḥman, and Rav Amram, and Rav Yitzḥak</b> all <b>say: A person does not render forbidden an item that is not his.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who</b> unwittingly <b>slaughters</b> an animal that was designated as <b>a sin offering on Shabbat outside</b> the Temple <b>for idol worship is liable</b> to bring <b>three sin offerings. And we interpreted</b> the <i>baraita</i> as being <b>in</b> the case <b>of a bird sin offering, and</b> in a case <b>where half of the windpipe was deficient. The reason</b> for the triple liability <b>is that it is a bird sin offering, as</b> then, <b>all of</b> the three prohibitions <b>come</b> to be violated <b>simultaneously.</b>

Daf 41a

<b>But</b> in the case of an animal <b>offering</b> there is <b>no</b> way in which one can violate all three prohibitions simultaneously. <b>But if a person does not render forbidden an item that is not his, why</b> must the <i>tanna</i> teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>specifically</b> with regard to <b>a bird sin offering?</b> The same <i>halakha</i> would apply <b>even</b> in the case of <b>an animal sin offering.</b> This is because cutting one <i>siman</i> for idolatry does not render the animal forbidden, as the priest has the exclusive right to derive benefit from it, so it does not belong to the owner anymore. Therefore, one would violate the three prohibitions simultaneously. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> one who brings a sin offering <b>acquires</b> the animal <b>for his atonement,</b> its status is <b>like</b> that of an animal that <b>is his,</b> and he renders it forbidden with the first cut at the beginning of the slaughter.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another objection from the mishna: If there were <b>two</b> people <b>grasping a knife</b> together <b>and slaughtering</b> an animal, <b>one</b> slaughtering <b>for the sake of one of all those</b> enumerated in the first clause of the mishna <b>and one</b> slaughtering <b>for the sake of a legitimate matter,</b> their <b>slaughter is not valid.</b> Based on the formulation of the mishna, the one slaughtering with improper intent is not necessarily the owner of the animal. How, then, can he render the animal forbidden? Apparently, one can render forbidden an item that is not his. The Gemara answers: <b>What are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the one with improper intent <b>has a partnership</b> share <b>in</b> the animal, so he is rendering his own animal forbidden.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another objection from a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 52b): With regard to <b>one who renders</b> another’s food <b>impure, and one who mixes</b> <i>teruma</i> with another’s non-sacred produce, <b>and one who pours</b> another’s wine as a libation before an idol, if he did so <b>unwittingly,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from payment of damages, even though he caused the other monetary loss. If he did so <b>intentionally,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay damages. Apparently, one can render forbidden an item that is not his. The Gemara answers: <b>Here too</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the one who caused the damage <b>has a partnership</b> share <b>in</b> the produce.
The Gemara notes that the dispute whether one who slaughters another’s animal for idol worship renders the animal forbidden, in accordance with Rav Huna, or does not render it forbidden, in accordance with Rav Naḥman, Rav Amram, and Rav Yitzḥak, is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a gentile who poured a Jew’s wine</b> as an idolatrous <b>libation,</b> but <b>not in the presence of</b> an object of <b>idol worship, he has rendered</b> the wine <b>forbidden. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira and Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava permit</b> drinking the wine <b>due to two factors: One</b> is <b>that</b> the presumption is that idol worshippers <b>pour wine as</b> an idolatrous <b>libation only in the presence of</b> an object of <b>idol worship. And</b> the other <b>one</b> is <b>that</b> even if the gentile poured the wine as an idolatrous libation, the Jew <b>can say to</b> the gentile: It is <b>not within your</b> power <b>to render my wine forbidden against my will.</b>
<b>And Rav Naḥman, and Rav Amram, and Rav Yitzḥak say:</b> Although Rav Huna’s opinion is compatible only with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> in the <i>baraita</i> and not with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira and Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava, we can state our opinion <b>even according to the one who says</b> that <b>a person renders forbidden an item that is not his,</b> e.g., by pouring his wine as a libation or slaughtering his animal for idol worship. <b>This statement</b> applies only in a case where <b>a gentile</b> pours the libation or slaughters the animal. <b>But</b> if <b>a Jew</b> pours the wine or slaughters the animal, presumably <b>he intends to torment</b> that other person, and not to engage in idol worship. Therefore, a Jew does not render the animal forbidden.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a contradiction to that distinction from the mishna: If there were <b>two</b> people <b>grasping a knife</b> together <b>and slaughtering</b> an animal, <b>one</b> slaughtering <b>for the sake of one of all those</b> enumerated in the first clause of the mishna <b>and one</b> slaughtering <b>for the sake of a legitimate matter,</b> their <b>slaughter is not valid.</b> As the mishna is discussing a case involving Jews, this indicates that even a Jew who slaughters an animal for idol worship renders it forbidden. The Gemara answers: <b>What are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing with the case <b>of a Jewish transgressor</b> whose intent when declaring that his slaughter is for the sake of mountains, hills, or other natural entities is for idol worship.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a contradiction to the distinction between a Jew and gentile from a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 52b): With regard to <b>one who renders</b> another’s food <b>impure, and one who mixes</b> <i>teruma</i> with another’s non-sacred produce, <b>and one who pours</b> another’s wine as a libation before an idol, if he did so <b>unwittingly,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from payment of damages, even though he caused the other monetary loss. If he did so <b>intentionally,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay damages. Apparently, a Jew who pours wine as a libation for idolatry renders wine that is not his forbidden. The Gemara answers: <b>Here too</b> the reference is <b>to an apostate Jew</b> whose intent is for idol worship.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> With regard to a Jew who is not a transgressor but declared that he is slaughtering another’s animal for idolatry, if those who heard his declaration <b>forewarned him</b> that doing so is prohibited by Torah law and is punishable by death, <b>and he acknowledged the forewarning</b> and said: It is in full knowledge of the prohibition and the punishment that I do so, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does he render the animal forbidden in that case? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Are you saying</b> a case where <b>he subjected himself to death</b> by acknowledging the forewarning? <b>You have no transgressor greater than that,</b> and he certainly renders the animal forbidden.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not slaughter</b> an animal and have its blood flow, <b>neither into seas, nor into rivers, nor into vessels,</b> as in all those cases it appears that he is slaughtering the animal in the manner of idolaters. <b>But one may slaughter</b> an animal and have its blood flow <b>into a round excavation</b> containing <b>water. And on a ship,</b> one may slaughter an animal <b>onto vessels</b> as it is clear that his objective is to avoid sullying the ship. <b>One may not slaughter</b> an animal and have its blood flow <b>into a small hole</b> in the ground <b>at all, but one may fashion a small hole inside his house so that the blood will enter into it. And in the marketplace one may not do so,</b> so <b>that</b> he will <b>not</b>

appear to <b>emulate [<i>yeḥakkeh</i>] the heretics.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: <b>One may not slaughter</b> an animal and have its blood flow, <b>neither into</b> seas, nor into rivers, nor into vessels, but one may slaughter an animal and have its blood flow into a round excavation containing water. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about slaughter <b>into seas?</b> Is it <b>that</b> one may <b>not</b> perform it, <b>as</b> onlookers will <b>say: He is slaughtering to the angel of the sea?</b> If so, slaughter <b>into a round excavation</b> containing <b>water</b> should <b>also</b> be prohibited, as onlookers will <b>say: He is slaughtering to</b> his <b>reflection [<i>bavua</i>],</b> which is also similar to idolatry. <b>Rava said:</b> The <i>tanna’im</i> <b>taught</b> that <i>halakha</i> <b>in</b> the case of <b>murky</b> water, in which no reflection can be seen.
§ The mishna states: <b>One</b> may <b>not slaughter</b> an animal and have its blood flow <b>into a small hole</b> in the ground at all, but one may fashion a small hole inside his house so that the blood will enter into it. The Gemara asks: How is it permitted to slaughter and have the blood flow into a hole inside his house? <b>But didn’t you</b> initially <b>say</b> that <b>one may not slaughter</b> an animal and have its blood flow <b>into a small hole</b> in the ground <b>at all? Abaye said: The first clause</b> of the mishna, where there is a blanket prohibition against having the blood flow into a small hole, is referring <b>to a small hole that is in the marketplace.</b>
<b>Rava said to him: But</b> isn’t it so that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches: And in the marketplace one may not do so, it may be inferred that</b> in <b>the first clause we are not dealing with the marketplace?</b>
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: One may not slaughter</b> an animal and have its blood flow <b>into a small hole</b> in the ground <b>at all. And one who wishes to clean his courtyard</b> and ensure that it will not be sullied in blood, <b>how does he do</b> so? <b>He fashions a place</b> with an incline or a furrow <b>outside the small hole, and slaughters</b> the animal there, <b>and the blood flows and descends into the hole. And in the marketplace one may not do so,</b> so <b>that</b> he will <b>not</b> appear to <b>emulate the heretics.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava:</b> If one <b>was traveling on a ship and he has no place on the ship to slaughter</b> an animal, <b>he extends his hand</b> with a knife, holds the head of the animal <b>outside</b> the walls of <b>the ship, and slaughters</b> the animal there; <b>and the blood flows and descends</b> down <b>the sides of the ship.</b> He may not slaughter an animal and have its blood flow directly into the sea. <b>And one may not slaughter</b> an animal and have its blood flow <b>into a small hole</b> in the ground <b>at all.</b>
<b>And one who wishes to clean his courtyard</b> and ensure that it will not be sullied with blood, <b>how does he do</b> so? <b>He fashions a place</b> with an incline or a furrow <b>outside the small hole, and slaughters</b> the animal there, <b>and the blood flows and descends into the hole. And in the marketplace, one may not do so, as it is stated: “Neither shall you follow their statutes”</b> (Leviticus 18:3). <b>And if he did so, he requires examination after his</b> actions to ascertain whether he is a heretic.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal and asserts that he is slaughtering it <b>for the sake of a burnt offering, for the sake of a peace offering, for the sake of a provisional guilt offering, for the sake of a Paschal offering,</b> or <b>for the sake of a thanks offering, his slaughter is not valid,</b> as it appears that he is consecrating animals and slaughtering sacrificial animals outside the Temple. <b>And Rabbi Shimon deems</b> his slaughter <b>valid.</b>
If there were <b>two</b> people <b>grasping a knife</b> together <b>and slaughtering</b> an animal, <b>one</b> slaughtering <b>for the sake of one of all those</b> enumerated in the first clause of the mishna <b>and one</b> slaughtering <b>for the sake of a legitimate matter,</b> their <b>slaughter is not valid.</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>for the sake of a sin offering, for the sake of a guilt offering</b> for <b>a definite</b> transgression, <b>for the sake of</b> the offering of <b>a firstborn, for the sake of</b> the offering of animal <b>tithe,</b> or <b>for the sake of a substitute</b> for a sacrificial animal, <b>his slaughter is valid.</b> All of these offerings may be brought only as obligations and not as gifts. Therefore, there is no concern that he consecrated the animals.
<b>This is the principle:</b> For <b>any item,</b> i.e., offering, <b>which</b> is consecrated as a voluntary <b>vow or gift,</b> in the case of <b>one who slaughters for its sake</b> the animal is <b>forbidden. And</b> for any offering <b>that is not</b> consecrated as a voluntary <b>vow or gift</b> but is an obligation that is incumbent upon him, in the case of <b>one who slaughters for its sake</b> the animal is <b>permitted.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal and asserts that he is slaughtering it <b>for the sake of a burnt offering,</b> for the sake of a peace offering, for the sake of a provisional guilt offering, for the sake of a Paschal offering, or for the sake of a thanks offering, the slaughter is not valid. This is because one who slaughters for the sake of any type of offering that is consecrated as a vow or as a gift renders the animal forbidden. The Gemara asks: <b>Is a provisional guilt offering fit</b> to be consecrated as <b>a vow or</b> as <b>a gift?</b> A provisional guilt offering is brought only when one is obligated to do so due to uncertainty whether or not he is liable to bring a sin offering. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>halakha</i> in the mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, who says</b> in a mishna (<i>Karetot</i> 25a): <b>A person donates a provisional guilt offering every day</b> if he chooses, due to concern that perhaps he violated a prohibition.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is a Paschal offering fit</b> to be consecrated as <b>a vow or</b> as <b>a gift? The time is fixed for its</b> offering on Passover eve, when bringing it is an obligation, and it may not be brought on any other day. <b>Rabbi Oshaya said: The Paschal offering is different, since</b> although the date for bringing and slaughtering it is the fourteenth of Nisan, <b>its designation</b> can be performed <b>throughout the entire year.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that slaughter of an animal for the sake of an offering is not valid <b>only</b> if the animals were <b>unblemished. But</b> with regard to animals with <b>blemishes,</b> the slaughterer <b>knows</b> that they are blemished and disqualified from sacrifice. Therefore, despite his declaration, there is no concern that his actual intent was to slaughter the animal for that purpose. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Slaughter of an animal for the sake of an offering is not valid <b>even</b> if the animals were <b>blemished as well,</b> as there are <b>times that an item is cast over the blemish</b> and covers it, <b>and he does not know</b> that the animal is blemished.
The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>for the sake of a sin offering,</b> his slaughter is valid, as, since one cannot voluntarily contribute a sin offering, there is no concern that the onlookers will draw the wrong conclusion. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that slaughter of an animal for the sake of a sin offering is valid <b>only</b> with regard to a slaughterer <b>who is not liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering. But</b> a slaughterer who knows that he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering,</b> his slaughter is not valid. <b>Say</b> that <b>he is performing</b> consecration and slaughter <b>for the sake of his sin offering.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> didn’t he say before the slaughter: For the sake of a sin offering, and <b>he did not say: For the sake of my sin offering?</b> Why, then, is that a concern? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> Indeed, the reference is to a case <b>where he says:</b> I am slaughtering this animal <b>for the sake of my sin offering.</b>
The mishna teaches: With regard to one who slaughters <b>for the sake of a substitute</b> for a sacrificial animal, his slaughter is valid. <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the slaughter is valid <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he does not have</b> an animal consecrated as <b>an offering inside his house</b> for which it can be the substitute, <b>but</b> if <b>he has</b> an animal consecrated as <b>an offering in his house, say</b> that he is <b>substituting</b> this animal <b>for it,</b> and the slaughter is not valid. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> didn’t he say before the slaughter: For the sake of a substitute for a sacrificial animal, and <b>he did not say: For the sake of a substitute for my</b> animal consecrated as an <b>offering?</b> Why, then, is that a concern? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> Indeed, the reference is to a case <b>where he says:</b> I am slaughtering this animal <b>for the sake of a substitute for my</b> animal consecrated as an <b>offering.</b>
The mishna states that <b>this is the principle:</b> For any offering that is consecrated as a voluntary vow or gift, in the case of one who slaughters for its sake, the animal is forbidden. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> case does this clause <b>add?</b> The list in the mishna appears to be comprehensive. The Gemara answers: The clause serves <b>to add</b> the <b>burnt offering of a nazirite. As, lest you say</b> there is no concern in that case, <b>as that</b> person did <b>not vow</b> to become a nazirite and could not possibly be obligated to bring that offering, therefore, the <i>tanna</i> teaches that there is a concern if he said he was slaughtering for the sake of the burnt offering of a nazirite. <b>Say</b> that perhaps <b>he vowed</b> to become a nazirite <b>in private,</b> and no one else was aware of it.
The Gemara asks: What is added by the second half of the principle: <b>And</b> for any offering <b>that is not consecrated</b> as a voluntary <b>vow or</b> as <b>a gift,</b> in the case of one who slaughters for its sake the animal is permitted? The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add the burnt offering of a woman after childbirth.</b> If one slaughters an animal for the sake of a burnt offering of a woman after childbirth, the slaughter is valid, as it is an obligation.
<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the slaughter is valid <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he does not have a wife. But</b> if <b>he has a wife, say that he performs</b> consecration and slaughter of the animal <b>for her sake</b> and therefore the slaughter is not valid. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> didn’t he say before the slaughter: For the sake of the burnt offering of a woman after childbirth, and <b>he did not say: For the sake of the burnt offering of my wife</b> after childbirth? Why, then, is that a concern? <b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> Indeed, the reference is to a case <b>where he says:</b> I am slaughtering this animal <b>for the sake of the burnt offering of my wife</b> after childbirth.
The Gemara objects: This is <b>obvious.</b> Clearly, if he explicitly declared that the slaughter is for the sake of the burnt offering of his wife after childbirth the slaughter is not valid.

Daf 42a

The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say: If it is so that</b> his wife <b>gave birth, it would have</b> generated <b>publicity</b> and been common knowledge; therefore, one might conclude that the slaughter is valid even if he declared that the slaughter is for the sake of the burnt offering of his wife after childbirth, as in fact she did not give birth. To counter this, Rabbi Elazar <b>teaches us</b> that the slaughter is not valid. <b>Say</b> that his wife <b>miscarried</b> and is liable to bring an offering, but it is not common knowledge, because the baby was not born alive.<br/>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>These</b> wounds constitute <b><i>tereifot</i> in an animal,</b> rendering them prohibited for consumption: <b>A perforated gullet,</b> where the perforation goes through the wall of the gullet, <b>or a cut windpipe.</b> If <b>the membrane of the brain was perforated,</b> or if <b>the heart was perforated to its chamber;</b> if <b>the spinal</b> column <b>was broken and its cord was cut;</b> if <b>the liver was removed and nothing remained of it,</b> any of these render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
Additionally, <b>a lung that was perforated or that was missing</b> a piece renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> It is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>unless it is perforated</b> through <b>to the bronchi.</b> If <b>the abomasum was perforated,</b> or <b>the gallbladder was perforated,</b> or <b>the small intestines were perforated,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i>. It is also a <i>tereifa</i> in a case <b>where the internal rumen was perforated or where the majority of the external</b> rumen <b>was torn. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> For <b>a large</b> animal, a tear of <b>one handbreadth</b> renders it a <i>tereifa</i>, while for <b>a small</b> animal, it is a <i>tereifa</i> only if <b>the majority of it</b> was torn. And it is a <i>tereifa</i> where the <b>omasum [<i>hemses</i>] or the reticulum was perforated to the outside,</b> i.e., to the abdominal cavity, but not if the perforation was between the two.
Likewise, if an animal <b>fell from the roof,</b> or if <b>the majority of its ribs were fractured, or</b> if it was <b>clawed by a wolf,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If it was <b>clawed by a wolf in</b> the case of <b>a small</b> animal, i.e., a sheep or goat; <b>or clawed by a lion in</b> the case of <b>a large</b> animal, i.e., cattle; or if it was <b>clawed by a hawk in</b> the case of <b>a small bird; or</b> if it was <b>clawed by a large</b> bird of prey <b>in</b> the case of <b>a large bird,</b> then it is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>This is the principle: Any</b> animal that was injured such <b>that</b> an animal in <b>a similar</b> condition <b>could not live</b> for an extended period is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> the consumption of which is forbidden by Torah law.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Where is there an allusion in the Torah to</b> the prohibition of <b>a <i>tereifa</i>?</b> The Gemara interjects: <b>Where</b> is there an allusion? Doesn’t the Torah state explicitly: <b>“You shall not eat any flesh that is torn of animals [<i>tereifa</i>] in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30)? <b>Rather,</b> the question is: <b>Where is there an allusion in the Torah to</b> the principle <b>that a <i>tereifa</i> cannot live? As</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in <b>the last clause: This is the principle: Any</b> animal that was injured such <b>that</b> an animal in <b>a similar</b> condition <b>could not live</b> for an extended period is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>;</b> one learns <b>by inference that a <i>tereifa</i> cannot live.</b> If so, <b>from where do we</b> derive this?
It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “These are the living things which you may eat</b> among all the animals that are on the earth” (Leviticus 11:2). The verse indicates that you may <b>eat a living</b> animal, i.e., one that can survive, but <b>you may not eat</b> an animal <b>that is not living,</b> i.e., one that cannot survive. One learns <b>by inference that a <i>tereifa</i> cannot live.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> can live, from where</b> does <b>he</b> derive this? The Gemara responds: He <b>derives it from</b> the same verse: <b>“These are the living things which you may eat</b> among all the animals.” “These” indicates that you may <b>eat</b> only <b>these living things,</b> but <b>you may not eat other living things,</b> i.e., <i>tereifot</i>. One learns <b>by inference that a <i>tereifa</i> can live.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the other</b> opinion, that a <i>tereifa</i> cannot live, <b>what does he do with this</b> word <b>“these”?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>He requires it for that which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught. As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that the verse: <b>“These are the living things which you may eat,” teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, seized</b> one <b>of each and every species</b> of animal <b>and showed it to Moses, and said to him: These</b> you <b>may eat, and these you may not eat.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But the other</b> opinion <b>also requires</b> the word “these” for <b>that which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught.</b> The Gemara replies: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so. Rather, from where</b> does <b>he</b> derive the principle <b>that a <i>tereifa</i> can live?</b> He <b>derives it from the other</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught. As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: “To make a difference…<b>between the living thing that may be eaten and the living thing that may not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 11:47). <b>These</b> living things that may not be eaten <b>are the eighteen <i>tereifot</i> that were stated to Moses at Sinai</b> and enumerated in the mishna. The verse, then, makes reference to a <i>tereifa</i> as a living thing.
The Gemara questions the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And are there no more</b> cases of <i>tereifot</i>? <b>But aren’t there</b> more cases cited in the Mishna and other <i>baraitot</i>, for which a mnemonic is given: <b><i>Beit</i>, <i>samekh</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>reish</i>; and</b> aren’t there <b>seven</b> additional <b><i>halakhot</i>,</b> i.e., cases of <i>tereifot</i>, taught by <i>amora’im</i>?

Daf 42b

<b>Granted, with regard to the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, one can say <b>that</b> the cases of <i>tereifot</i> that <b>he taught</b> explicitly in the mishna, <b>he taught, and</b> that any case <b>that</b> he <b>omitted comes</b> under the general statement beginning: <b>This is the principle. But with regard to the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who <b>said: Eighteen <i>tereifot</i>,</b> one must ask: <b>And are there no more</b> cases of <i>tereifot</i>? <b>But aren’t there</b> the four cases represented by the mnemonic <i>beit</i>, <i>samekh</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>reish</i>, the first of which is taught in a mishna (76a): <b>An animal whose hind legs were severed from the leg joint and above</b> is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>?</b> The Gemara responds: The <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, who says:</b> The severed leg <b>can be cauterized and</b> the animal will <b>live.</b> Therefore, such a wound does not render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara objects: But <b>even</b> if one holds <b>that</b> the severed leg <b>can be cauterized and</b> the animal will <b>live,</b> this does not mean that the animal is not a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>According to whom is</b> the question: But aren’t there the cases of <i>beit</i>, <i>samekh</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>reish</i>, <b>stated?</b> It is stated <b>according to</b> the <b><i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who holds that there are only eighteen <i>tereifot</i>. But <b>the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael maintains</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> can live.</b> If so, the fact that the animal can live if the stump of its severed limb is cauterized is immaterial to whether it is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rather,</b> say that the <i>tanna</i> <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> insofar <b>as he says</b> that an animal with a severed leg <b>is kosher.</b> Yet, he disagrees with the claim that the reason is because the animal can survive.
The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of <b>a deficiency in the spine? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:3): <b>How much</b> is considered <b>a deficiency in the spine</b> of a corpse so that it will not be considered a full corpse to impart impurity in a tent? <b>Beit Shammai say: Two</b> missing <b>vertebrae, and Beit Hillel say: One vertebra. And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> Just as Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree with regard to ritual impurity, <b>so too</b> they disagree <b>with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> i.e., according to Beit Hillel an animal missing only one vertebra is a <i>tereifa</i>. This is not included in the count of Rabbi Yishmael.
The Gemara responds: The <b>omasum or the reticulum</b> that were perforated on their outer walls, <b>which you count as two</b> separate cases, <b>should be counted as one</b> case. Accordingly, <b>one</b> case has been <b>removed</b> from the count of eighteen <i>tereifot</i> <b>and one</b> case has been <b>inserted,</b> i.e., the case of a deficiency in the spine, and there are still only eighteen cases.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of the <i>tereifa</i> mentioned in the mishna on 54a of an animal <b>whose hide was removed?</b> The Gemara responds: The <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who deems</b> such an animal <b>kosher.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t there</b> also the case of an animal that is a <i>tereifa</i> because of <b>a shriveled</b> lung? The Gemara responds: The mishna states that a perforated <b>gallbladder</b> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>; but <b>who teaches this? Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> teaches this. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>removed</b> the <b>gallbladder</b> from the list, since it is only the opinion of an individual, <b>and inserted a shriveled</b> lung.
The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t there</b> the <b>seven</b> additional <b><i>halakhot</i>,</b> i.e., cases of <i>tereifot</i>, taught by <i>amora’im</i>? The Gemara enumerates the seven <i>halakhot</i>: <b>As Rav Mattana says: This head of the femur that was</b> completely <b>dislocated</b> renders the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And Rakhish bar Pappa says in the name of Rav:</b> If the animal <b>was diseased</b> even <b>in one kidney,</b> it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And we learned</b> in a mishna (54a) that if <b>the spleen was removed</b> the animal is <b>kosher, and</b> with regard to this mishna, <b>Rav Avira says in the name of Rava: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> when the spleen was <b>removed; but</b> if it was <b>perforated,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If the <b>two organs that must be severed in ritual slaughter [<i>simanim</i>],</b> i.e., the windpipe and the gullet, <b>were mostly detached,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And Rabba bar Rav Sheila says</b> that <b>Rav Mattana says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>a rib was torn out from its root,</b> along with half of the attached vertebra, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>; and a skull that was mostly crushed,</b> even if the membranes are intact, renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>; <b>and</b> if <b>a majority of</b> the <b>flesh that envelops the majority of the rumen</b> was torn, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b>.
The Gemara responds: <b>There are eight</b> cases of <b>perforated</b> organs mentioned in the mishna that render an animal a <i>tereifa</i>. The <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael <b>counts them</b> all <b>as one</b> case. Accordingly, <b>he removed seven</b> cases from the count of eighteen <b>and inserted</b> these <b>seven</b> <i>halakhot</i>.
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> since <b>there are also two</b> cases of <b>cut</b> organs in the mishna, the spinal cord and the windpipe, let the <i>tanna</i> <b>count them as one.</b> The count of <i>tereifot</i> then falls <b>one short</b> of eighteen. <b>And furthermore,</b> if all the cases of perforated organs are counted as one, then one cannot insert the case taught by <b>Rav Avira in the name of Rava,</b> i.e., that of a perforated spleen, since it <b>is also</b> a case of <b>a perforated</b> organ. If so, the count falls two short of eighteen.

Daf 43a

The Gemara responds: <b>Rather,</b> if one counts this way, one must say that <b>these two</b> cases that <b>you removed,</b> i.e., an animal whose hind legs were severed and one whose hide was removed, <b>do not remove.</b> The count will then remain eighteen.
§ <b>Ulla says: Eight types of <i>tereifot</i> were stated to Moses at Sinai,</b> and all the cases mentioned in the Mishna and elsewhere fall into these categories: An animal whose organ was <b>perforated or severed, removed or missing</b> a piece, one that was <b>torn or clawed</b> by wild animals, or that <b>fell or</b> was <b>broken.</b> The Gemara notes: This list is compiled <b>to the exclusion of a diseased</b> organ, <b>which Rakhish bar Pappa</b> mentioned with regard to a kidney. Ulla does not deem this a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Ḥiyya bar Rava says: There are eight <i>tereifot</i> in</b> the category of <b>a perforated</b> organ: A perforated gullet, brain membrane, heart, lung, abomasum, intestine, inner rumen, and reticulum or omasum that was perforated to the outside. <b>If you say</b> that there are <b>nine,</b> because a perforated gallbladder is also mentioned in the mishna, one can say that with regard to the <b>gallbladder,</b> only <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, teaches it,</b> and it is the opinion of an individual. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the abomasum was perforated,</b> or <b>the intestines were perforated,</b> it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: Even</b> if <b>the gallbladder was perforated</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i>.
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the following statements of Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Yosef: <b><i>Halakhot</i>, friend, olive-bulk, gallbladder, and gizzard.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Yosef, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> disagrees with the statement of Ḥiyya bar Rava and <b>says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that a perforated gallbladder renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Yosef, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What did the friends of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, respond to him?</b> They responded that Job said: <b>“He pours out my gall upon the ground”</b> (Job 16:13), <b>and</b> yet <b>Job</b> was <b>still alive.</b> Evidently, one with a perforated gallbladder can live. Rabbi Yosei <b>said to them:</b> Job was kept alive by a miracle, and <b>one does not mention miraculous acts</b> as proof for a general ruling. <b>As, if you do not say so,</b> then the other phrase in the verse: <b>“He cleaves my kidneys asunder, and does not spare,”</b> is problematic. <b>Does</b> one with cleaved kidneys <b>live? Rather, a miracle is different, as it is written</b> that God said to Satan with regard to Job: <b>“Only spare his life”</b> (Job 2:6). Under natural circumstances, Job should have died from his injuries, but in this case he was kept alive by a miracle. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to the gallbladder, one must say that <b>a miracle is different,</b> and one cannot bring proof from it.
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Yosef, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of the one who says</b> that if the liver of an animal was removed but one <b>olive-bulk</b> of it remains, it is kosher.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> really <b>say this? But doesn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is always <b>in accordance with an unattributed mishna; and we learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>the liver was removed and nothing remained of it,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>? One can infer that if any of it <b>remained,</b> the animal is <b>kosher even if</b> what remains <b>does not</b> constitute <b>an olive-bulk.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>They are <i>amora’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> as to whether he holds that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with an unattributed mishna.
The Gemara brings another statement <b>that Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Yosef, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If the <b>gallbladder was perforated</b> in a place where it was adjacent to the liver, <b>and the liver seals</b> the hole, the animal is <b>kosher,</b> even though a perforated gallbladder normally renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> according to Rabbi Yoḥanan.
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rabbi Yosef, says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Even though the mishna on 56a teaches that if a bird’s gizzard was perforated it is a <i>tereifa</i>, if <b>the gizzard was perforated but its</b> inner <b>lining is intact,</b> the bird is <b>kosher.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>the</b> inner <b>lining</b> of the gizzard <b>was perforated, but</b> the flesh of <b>the gizzard is intact, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from that <b>which Rav Naḥman said</b> with regard to a perforated gullet: If both its outer and inner lining were perforated, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, but if <b>this</b> lining <b>was perforated without that</b> lining being perforated, it is <b>kosher.</b> Similarly, <b>Rava says: The gullet has two linings,</b> the <b>outer red, and</b> the <b>inner white.</b> If <b>this</b> lining <b>was perforated without that</b> lining being perforated, the animal is <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need for Rava <b>to state</b> that the <b>outer</b> one is <b>red and</b> the <b>inner</b> one is <b>white?</b> Isn’t this self-evident? The Gemara responds: This teaches <b>that if</b> the two were <b>switched,</b> i.e., the outer lining turned white and the inner red, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>both</b> linings <b>were perforated,</b> but <b>not adjacent to one another, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Mar Zutra says in the name of Rav Pappa:</b> If this occurred <b>in the gullet,</b> the animal is <b>kosher;</b> but if it occurred <b>in the gizzard,</b> it is <b>unfit</b> for consumption. <b>Rav Ashi objects to this: On the contrary, the gullet, with which</b> the animal <b>eats and calls, is spacious</b> and flexible, and the animal <b>constricts it and stretches it.</b> Since the two linings are not connected to each other, <b>there are times</b> in the course of their movement <b>that</b> the two holes <b>align [<i>demihandezin</i>] with one another,</b> creating a fully aligned perforation. But the <b>gizzard, which is</b> always <b>at rest</b> in place, <b>stands as it</b> always <b>stands.</b> Accordingly, two such perforations will never align. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Yosef, said to Rav Ashi: So we say in the name of Mar Zutra, that</b> he in fact <b>said in the name of Rav Pappa in accordance with your</b> objection.
§ <b>And Rabba says: A membrane that appeared due to a wound in the gullet,</b> i.e., a scab that covered a perforation, <b>is not</b> considered <b>a membrane</b> that prevents the animal from being rendered a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And Rabba says:</b> The <b>gullet cannot be inspected from outside</b> to determine whether the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, since the outer lining itself is red, and therefore reddening due to injury cannot be discerned in it. <b>Rather,</b> it must be inspected <b>from inside,</b> where the lining is white. The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there as a result of this statement, i.e., in what case must the gullet be checked from the inside?

Daf 43b

The Gemara responds: The <i>halakha</i> is necessary <b>for</b> a case in which it was <b>uncertain</b> whether an animal was <b>clawed</b> by a predator. If the animal was in fact clawed, the gullet would have become red. Since the outer lining is always red, the gullet must be checked on the inside to ascertain whether it is still white.
The Gemara recounts the case of <b>a certain</b> animal concerning which it was <b>uncertain</b> whether it was <b>clawed</b> by a predator, <b>which came before Rabba. Rabba was checking its gullet from the outside. Abaye said to him: But isn’t it</b> you, <b>Master, who says:</b> The <b>gullet may be inspected only from the inside? Rabba turned over</b> the gullet <b>and checked it</b> from the inside, <b>and found on it two drops of blood, and deemed it a <i>tereifa</i></b> due to clawing. The Gemara notes: <b>And Rabba as well desired</b> only <b>to sharpen Abaye</b> by inducing him to ask. He did not forget his own statement.
<b>Ulla says: If a thorn sat in</b> the animal’s <b>gullet</b> but did not perforate the outer lining, <b>one</b> need <b>not be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> it perforated the outer lining beforehand and the perforation <b>healed</b> and a scab formed over it, in which case the animal would be a <i>tereifa</i>, as stated above. Rather, one assumes that the thorn never perforated the outer lining and the animal is kosher.
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the following questions with regard to Ulla’s statement: <b>Clawed, pieces, with a knife, ritually impure.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Ulla,</b> given that this is a case of uncertainty, in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> it <b>different from</b> a case of <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether an animal was <b>clawed,</b> where the animal must be checked and cannot be presumed kosher? The Gemara responds: <b>Ulla holds</b> that <b>one</b> need <b>not be concerned with regard to an uncertainty</b> as to whether the animal was <b>clawed.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> a case where there were <b>two pieces</b> of fat before a person, <b>one of forbidden fat and one of</b> permitted <b>fat,</b> and the person ate one piece but does not know which one, where the <i>halakha</i> is that one must bring a provisional guilt offering due to the possibility that he consumed forbidden fat? Evidently, one may not presume that an item is permitted in a case of uncertainty. The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> one finds <b>a presumption of prohibition,</b> since one of the pieces is certainly prohibited. Here, with regard to the thorn, there is no presumption of prohibition.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> the case of the thorn <b>different from</b> the case of <b>one who slaughters with a knife</b> that was previously checked for flaws <b>but was</b> then <b>found to be notched</b> after the slaughter? In that case, it is uncertain whether the notch existed at the time of slaughter, yet the animal is prohibited. The Gemara responds: <b>There, a deficiency was born in the knife.</b> Accordingly, one must be concerned that it was notched beforehand as well. By contrast, the wall of the gullet is currently intact, and one may therefore presume that it was intact beforehand as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from an uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>ritual impurity in a private domain, whose uncertainty</b> is presumed <b>impure?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>But according to your reasoning, let us compare it</b> instead <b>to uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>impurity in a public domain, whose uncertainty</b> is presumed <b>pure. Rather, there,</b> with regard to the presumption of impurity in a private domain and purity in a public domain, the Sages <b>learned this <i>halakha</i> through tradition from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>].</b> Therefore, one cannot extend it to other cases.
The Gemara relates that <b>one of the Sages was sitting before Rav Kahana, and he was sitting and saying:</b> It <b>was stated</b> that one need not be concerned that the thorn perforated the linings of the gullet only if it <b>was found</b> loose inside the gullet. <b>But</b> if it <b>sat</b> embedded in the gullet wall, <b>we</b> must be <b>concerned</b> that the outer lining was perforated and later healed, rendering the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rav Kahana said to</b> the other Sages: <b>Do not listen to him.</b> Rather, it <b>was stated</b> that one need not be concerned about a possible perforation if the thorn <b>sat</b> embedded in the gullet wall. <b>But</b> in a case where it was simply <b>found</b> there loose, it <b>was not necessary for Ulla</b> to say that the animal is kosher, <b>since all animals</b> that live <b>outside eat thorns,</b> and it is reasonable to expect to find them in the gullet without presuming injury.
§ The mishna teaches that if the gullet was perforated, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>It was stated:</b> In a case where <b>the entrance [<i>turbatz</i>] of the gullet</b> from the pharynx was perforated, <b>Rav says:</b> The animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if <b>any</b> part of the gullet was perforated. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> It is a <i>tereifa</i> only if <b>its majority</b> was perforated. <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>any</b> part was perforated, because he holds that the entrance of the gullet <b>is a location</b> fit for <b>slaughter</b> and is therefore considered part of the gullet. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> If <b>its majority</b> was perforated, because he holds that <b>it is not a location</b> fit for <b>slaughter</b> and is not considered part of the gullet.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Which</b> area <b>is the entrance of the gullet? Mari bar Mar Ukva said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: All</b> of the area <b>that widens</b> outward <b>when cut</b> along its width, <b>this is the entrance of the gullet;</b> all the area that <b>remains in place when cut, this is the gullet itself. Rav Pappi said to them: Master did not say so. And who is</b> that Master? It is <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye. Rather,</b> he said that <b>all</b> of the area <b>that remains in place when cut, this is the entrance of the gullet. But which</b> area, then, <b>is the gullet itself?</b> It is <b>all</b> of the area <b>that constricts when cut</b> and closes inward. The Sage <b>Yona says</b> in the name of Rabbi <b>Zeira:</b> The entrance of the gullet is only the area of the <b>throat immediately</b> bordering the gullet. <b>And how much</b> of the throat qualifies as the entrance of the gullet? <b>Rav Avya said: Less than</b> the length of <b>a barley</b> kernel <b>and more than</b> the length of <b>a wheat</b> kernel.
The Gemara relates an incident involving <b>a certain bull that belonged to the sons of Rav Ukva, where</b> its <b>slaughter began</b> with a small incision <b>in the entrance of the gullet and concluded</b> in its majority <b>in the gullet. Rava said: I impose upon it the stringencies of Rav and the stringencies of Shmuel, and deem it a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
I impose the <b>stringencies of Rav, as Rav said:</b> The animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if <b>any</b> part of the entrance of the gullet was perforated before slaughter. Such is the case here, since the incision began in the entrance of the gullet. Perhaps one will ask: <b>But doesn’t Rav say</b> that the entrance of the gullet <b>is a location</b> fit for <b>slaughter,</b> in which case the initial incision should be considered the beginning of the act of slaughter? To this I will respond: I hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who says</b> that it is <b>not a location</b> fit for <b>slaughter.</b> If one asks: <b>If</b> I hold in accordance with the opinion of <b>Shmuel, doesn’t he say:</b> It is a <i>tereifa</i> only if it was perforated <b>in its majority?</b> To this I will respond: I hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who says:</b> If <b>any</b> part was perforated. Consequently, I deem the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara relates that <b>the matter circulated,</b> and <b>it came before Rabbi Abba,</b> who <b>said to</b> his students: This <b>bull is permitted</b> for consumption, <b>both according to Rav,</b> who holds that the entrance of the gullet is a location fit for slaughter, <b>and according to Shmuel,</b> who holds that it is not a <i>tereifa</i> unless it is perforated in its majority. Therefore, <b>go tell the son of Rav Yosef bar Ḥama,</b> i.e., Rava, <b>that</b> he is <b>to pay the value of the bull to its owner,</b> since he improperly deemed it a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Mar, son of Ravina, said: I offer a conclusive refutation to the enemies of Rava,</b> a euphemism for Rava himself, from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>always in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel, but one who wishes to act in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai may do so,</b> and one who wishes to act <b>in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel may do so.</b> But if one wishes to adopt both <b>the leniencies of Beit Shammai and</b> also <b>the leniencies of Beit Hillel, he is a wicked person.</b>

Daf 44a

And one who wishes to adopt both <b>the stringencies of Beit Shammai and the stringencies of Beit Hillel, with regard to him the verse states: “The fool walks in darkness”</b> (Ecclesiastes 2:14). <b>Rather,</b> one should act <b>either in accordance with Beit Shammai,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies, or in accordance with Beit Hillel,</b> following both <b>their leniencies and their stringencies.</b>
The Gemara objects to the wording of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult.</b> First <b>you say</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>always in accordance with the statement of Beit Hillel, and then</b> you <b>teach</b> that <b>one who wishes to act in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai may do so.</b>
The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the statement that a person may act as he wishes was made <b>before the Divine Voice</b> emerged and announced that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with Beit Hillel. <b>There,</b> the statement that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with Beit Hillel was made <b>after the Divine Voice</b> issued this ruling.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>even</b> the statement that a person may act as he wishes was made <b>after the Divine Voice</b> announced that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Beit Hillel, <b>and</b> this statement <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, who says: One disregards a Divine Voice</b> that attempts to intervene in matters of <i>halakha</i>. According to him, the dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel has not yet been decided.
The Gemara notes: <b>In any case,</b> Rava’s ruling is <b>difficult.</b> How could he rule in accordance with two contradictory stringencies in order to deem the animal a <i>tereifa</i>?
<b>Rav Tavut said:</b> Rava <b>acted entirely in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav. As when Rami bar Yeḥezkel came, he said: Do not listen to those principles that</b> Rav <b>Yehuda, my brother, formulated in the name of Rav.</b> Although Rav holds that a perforation of any part of the entrance of the gullet renders an animal a <i>tereifa</i>, this is not because it is a location fit for slaughter. Rather, <b>this</b> is what <b>Rav said: The Sages gave a measure</b> defining the portion of the <b>gullet</b> that is valid for slaughter. <b>By inference,</b> one learns that <b>the entrance of the gullet is not a location</b> fit for <b>slaughter. And</b> nevertheless, <b>he says</b> that a perforation <b>in any amount</b> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
Since it was mentioned that the Sages gave a measure defining the portion of the gullet that is valid for slaughter, the Gemara asks: <b>How far up</b> the gullet is the upper boundary for valid slaughter? <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> It is <b>until</b> the point that there remains only <b>sufficient</b> space for <b>a hand</b> to <b>grip</b> the gullet. The Gemara asks: <b>How far down</b> is the lower boundary? <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: Until</b> the gullet <b>becomes hairy,</b> i.e., until the opening of the rumen, whose lining is hairy.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Ravina say</b> that <b>Geneiva says in the name of Rav:</b> The lowermost <b>handbreadth in the gullet, adjacent to the rumen, this is the inner rumen?</b> If so, <b>why</b> does Rav Naḥman permit slaughter until the opening of the rumen? <b>When one slaughters</b> within the bottom handbreadth, <b>he is slaughtering in the rumen,</b> and his slaughter should be invalid.
Rather, <b>say</b> that Rav’s statement should be amended, as follows: The uppermost <b>handbreadth in the rumen, adjacent to the gullet, this is the inner rumen,</b> which is not a valid location for slaughter. By contrast, the lowermost handbreadth of the gullet is a valid location for slaughter. And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>when Rav says</b> that the lowermost handbreadth of the gullet is considered the rumen, he is referring specifically <b>to a bull, which is especially hairy,</b> and hairs appear even within the lowermost handbreadth of the gullet itself. By contrast, in other animals, the entire lower gullet is a valid location for slaughter.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>the entrance of the gullet was completely detached from the jaw,</b> the animal is <b>kosher. And the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna also <b>taught</b> this later (54a): If <b>the lower jaw was detached</b> entirely, it is <b>kosher.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this:</b> How can Shmuel say that if the entrance of the gullet is detached the animal is kosher? <b>But isn’t there ripping of the <i>simanim</i>,</b> the gullet and the windpipe, from their place? This should render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara interjects: <b>But according to Rav Pappa, the mishna</b> is <b>difficult</b> as well, since it states: If <b>the lower jaw was detached,</b> it is <b>kosher.</b> If the lower jaw is detached, the windpipe and gullet will necessarily be detached as well, since they are attached to it.
The Gemara responds: <b>Granted, the mishna</b> is <b>not difficult for Rav Pappa. This</b> <i>halakha</i>, that the ripping of the <i>simanim</i> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, applies only <b>when</b> the <i>simanim</i> are <b>completely ripped</b> from the jaw. <b>That</b> statement of the mishna, that an animal whose jaw is detached is kosher, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the lower jaw <b>is severed above</b> its connection to the <b><i>simanim</i>,</b> which themselves remain connected to the remaining flesh of the jaw. <b>But</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the ripping of the <i>simanim</i> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> is <b>difficult for Shmuel.</b> How can an animal remain kosher when the entrance of its gullet is removed, if this entails the ripping of the <i>simanim</i>?
The Gemara responds: <b>Do not say</b> that Shmuel deems the animal kosher if the entrance of the gullet was <b>completely</b> detached. <b>Rather, say</b> that he deems it kosher only if it was <b>mostly</b> detached.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Shmuel says: <i>Simanim</i> that were detached in their majority</b> render the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>? Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: This</b> statement of Shmuel, that the animal is kosher even if the <i>simanim</i> are mostly detached, applies only to a case in <b>which</b> the entrance of the gullet <b>was peeled off</b> from the flesh of the jaw, such that the connected tissue is concentrated in one area. In such a case, the animal might recover. <b>There,</b> where Shmuel deems the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, he is referring to a case in <b>which</b> the <i>simanim</i> <b>were</b> forcibly <b>separated [<i>de’ippruk ipprukei</i>]</b> from the jaw and are connected only by a few discontinuous pieces of flesh. In such a case the animal cannot recover.
§ The mishna states: <b>Or</b> an animal with <b>a cut windpipe,</b> cut across its width, is a <i>tereifa</i>. With regard to this the Sages <b>taught: How much</b> must <b>the windpipe</b> be <b>cut</b> to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>In its majority. And how much is its majority? Rav says:</b>

Daf 44b

<b>The majority of its width,</b> counting the width of the wall of the windpipe itself, the thickness of which is uneven. <b>And some say</b> that Rav says: The <b>majority of its space,</b> the inner area of the cross section of the windpipe, not counting the width of the windpipe wall.
The Gemara recounts: There was <b>a certain</b> animal with <b>a cut windpipe that came before Rav,</b> i.e., it was brought for inspection to decide whether it was kosher. Rav <b>was sitting and checking it</b> to see if the windpipe had been cut <b>in the majority of its width. Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav:</b> Didn’t <b>you teach us, our teacher,</b> that a cut windpipe is measured by the <b>majority of its space?</b> Rav <b>sent</b> the animal <b>before Rabba bar bar Ḥana,</b> who <b>checked it in the majority of its space and deemed it kosher, and purchased meat from it</b> at the price of <b>thirteen plain <i>istera</i> coins.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And how</b> could Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>do this,</b> i.e., deem permitted an animal that Rav was going to deem prohibited? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a halakhic authority deemed</b> an item <b>impure, another</b> halakhic authority <b>is not allowed to deem</b> it <b>pure;</b> likewise, if he <b>prohibited</b> it, <b>another</b> authority <b>is not allowed to permit</b> it? The Gemara responds: It <b>is different here, since Rav did not</b> actually <b>prohibit</b> the animal. He merely considered doing so, but he sent it to Rabba bar bar Ḥana before issuing a formal ruling.
The Gemara asks: <b>And once a halakhic authority has ruled with regard to</b> the animal, even to permit it, <b>how</b> could Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>eat from it? But isn’t it written: “Then I said: Alas, Lord God, my soul has not become impure; and from my youth until now I have not eaten an unslaughtered carcass, or a <i>tereifa</i>; and no <i>piggul</i> flesh came into my mouth”</b> (Ezekiel 4:14).
The Sages interpreted the verse as follows: <b>“My soul has not been become impure”</b> means <b>that I did not think</b> of sexual thoughts <b>during the day</b> so as <b>to come to</b> the <b>impurity</b> of a seminal emission <b>at night. “I have not eaten an unslaughtered carcass, or a <i>tereifa</i>”</b> means <b>that I never ate</b> the <b>flesh of</b> an animal that was in danger of imminent death, leading one to say: <b>Slaughter</b> it, <b>slaughter</b> it quickly, before it dies. <b>“And no <i>piggul</i> flesh came into my mouth,”</b> means <b>that I never ate from an animal</b> with regard to <b>which</b> there was uncertainty whether it is prohibited and <b>a Sage issued a ruling</b> to permit it. The Sages <b>said in the name of Rabbi Natan:</b> The phrase means <b>that I never ate from an animal</b> from <b>which the gifts</b> of the priesthood, the foreleg, jaw, and abomasum, <b>were not separated.</b> The above acts are technically permitted but unseemly. How, then, could Rabba bar bar Ḥana consume the meat of this animal?
The Gemara responds: <b>This statement,</b> that it is unseemly for a halakhic authority to rely on his own ruling to permit the meat, applies only to <b>a matter that depends on reasoning. Rabba bar bar Ḥana relied on his learning,</b> i.e., a received tradition. There is nothing unseemly about relying upon a received tradition.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> let one <b>derive</b> that Rabba bar bar Ḥana should not have purchased the meat <b>due to suspicion, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>issued a judgment, acquitted or convicted, deemed impure or pure, prohibited or permitted; or</b> if <b>witnesses testified</b> with regard to a case, in <b>all of</b> these instances the judges or witnesses <b>are allowed to purchase</b> the item that they deemed permitted. <b>But the Sages said: Distance</b> yourself <b>from unseemliness and from</b> things <b>similar to it.</b> If so, Rabba bar bar Ḥana should not have purchased the meat that he himself permitted.
The Gemara responds: <b>This statement</b> applies only to <b>an item that is sold</b> based on <b>an appraisal</b> of its value and not by standard measure. In such cases onlookers might suspect that the judge is receiving a favorable price in return for his judgment. But <b>here, the weight</b> of the meat <b>proves</b> that the judge is not receiving a discount, but is paying the standard price. This is <b>like that</b> incident <b>where Rabba permitted</b> a possible <b><i>tereifa</i></b> for consumption <b>and bought meat from it.</b> His wife, <b>the daughter of Rav Ḥisda, said to him: Father permitted a firstborn</b> animal, declaring that it possessed a blemish that renders it permitted for consumption, <b>but did not buy meat from it.</b> Why are you acting differently?
Rabba <b>said to her: That matter</b> applies to <b>a firstborn, which is sold</b> based <b>on appraisal</b> of its value. <b>Here, the weight</b> of the meat <b>proves</b> that I am paying the standard price and not unfairly deriving benefit from my judgment. <b>What</b> suspicion <b>is there</b> in this case? Will people suspect me <b>because</b> I received <b>a superior piece of meat? Every day they sell me a superior piece of meat.</b>
The Gemara cites an aphorism: <b>Rav Ḥisda says: Who is a Torah scholar? This is one who sees his own <i>tereifa</i>.</b> In other words, when the status of his own animal is uncertain, he deems it prohibited without concern for his own monetary loss. <b>And Rav Ḥisda says: Who is</b> referred to by the verse: <b>“He that hates gifts shall live”</b> (Proverbs 15:27)? <b>This is one who sees his own <i>tereifa</i>.</b> He is careful to avoid deriving benefit from that which is not his own, and even from items that are his concerning which it is questionable whether or not they are permitted.
<b>Mar Zutra taught in the name of Rav Ḥisda: Anyone who reads</b> the Torah <b>and studies</b> the Mishna, <b>and sees his own <i>tereifa</i>, and has served Torah scholars</b> to learn the ways of halakhic judgment, <b>about him the verse states: “When you eat the labor of your hands, happy shall you be, and it shall be well with you”</b> (Psalms 128:2). <b>Rav Zevid says:</b> Such a person <b>merits inheriting two worlds, this world and the World-to-Come.</b> When the verse states: <b>“Happy shall you be,”</b> it means <b>in this world,</b> and when it states: <b>“And it shall be well with you,”</b> it is referring <b>to the World-to-Come.</b>
With regard to the verse: “He that hates gifts shall live,” the Gemara relates that <b>when they would send Rabbi Elazar some</b> gift <b>from the house of the <i>Nasi</i>, he would not take</b> it. <b>And when they would invite him, he would not go</b> there. When declining these offers, <b>he said</b> to them: <b>Does Master not desire that I live? As it is written: “He that hates gifts shall live.”</b> By contrast, <b>when they would send</b> a gift <b>to Rabbi Zeira, he would not take</b> it, but <b>when they would invite him he would go. He said</b> in explanation:

Daf 45a

<b>It is an honor for them to honor me.</b> My attendance is not for my benefit but for theirs.
§ With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that a cut windpipe renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If the windpipe <b>was perforated</b> with a series of small holes around its circumference <b>like a sieve,</b> the small holes <b>join together to</b> constitute <b>a majority</b> of the circumference. Therefore, if their collective size is a majority of the circumference, the windpipe is considered cut.
<b>Rav Yirmeya raises an objection:</b> The mishna teaches (<i>Oholot</i> 2:3) that if a skull of a corpse has a round hole at least the size of a drill bit used for surgery, then the skull does not impart ritual impurity in a tent. With regard to this, a <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And in a skull that contains one long hole,</b> or <b>even</b> if <b>it has many</b> small <b>holes,</b> the areas of the holes <b>join together to</b> constitute the <b>size of a drill hole. Evidently, since the</b> requisite <b>measure is</b> the <b>size of a drill hole,</b> the small holes <b>join together to</b> constitute the <b>size of a drill hole,</b> and not another measure. If so, <b>here, too,</b> in the case of the windpipe, <b>since the</b> requisite <b>measure</b> of a hole to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i> is the size of <b>an <i>issar</i></b> (see 54a), the small holes should <b>join together to</b> constitute the size of <b>an <i>issar</i>.</b> Why must they constitute the majority of the circumference?
The Gemara notes: <b>It escaped him,</b> i.e., Rav Yirmeya, <b>that which Rabbi Ḥelbo says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya says</b> that <b>Rav says: Perforations that are a deficiency,</b> i.e., holes of significant area, <b>join together to</b> constitute the size of <b>an <i>issar</i>, and</b> perforations <b>that are not a deficiency,</b> but are as small as the holes of a sieve, must <b>join together to</b> constitute <b>a majority</b> of the circumference, which is the measure of a cut windpipe. Since the holes are not substantial in area, the windpipe cannot be said to be missing a piece, but it may be considered cut.
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> If <b>a strip</b> of the windpipe <b>was removed from it,</b> its area <b>joins to</b> constitute the size of <b>an <i>issar</i>,</b> even if the strip itself is narrower than an <i>issar</i>. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi:</b> If the windpipe <b>was perforated like a sieve, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said to him:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> with regard to this case: <b>Perforations that are a deficiency join together to</b> constitute the size of <b>an <i>issar</i>, and</b> perforations <b>that are not a deficiency join together to</b> constitute <b>a majority</b> of the circumference.
The Gemara raises a question: The measure of an <i>issar</i> for missing flesh in the windpipe applies only to animals. In birds, this cannot be the measure, as the entire width of the windpipe is less than the diameter of an <i>issar</i>. <b>What,</b> then, is the measure <b>with regard to a bird?</b>
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani said: It was explained to me</b> personally <b>by Rabbi Elazar:</b> One severs the perforated tissue, <b>folds and lays it over the opening of the windpipe. If</b> it <b>covers the majority of the windpipe,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>; and if not,</b> the animal is <b>kosher. Rav Pappa said: And your mnemonic</b> for this <i>halakha</i> should be <b>a sieve.</b> If the tissue is perforated like a sieve, one must place it over the opening of the windpipe as if it were a sieve.
The Gemara continues: If the windpipe <b>was missing</b> a piece so that its appearance was <b>like a door,</b> where the missing flesh was partially attached as though on a hinge, <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> If the missing piece is <b>so</b> large <b>that an <i>issar</i> can enter</b> the hole <b>widthwise,</b> i.e., it is wider and taller than an <i>issar</i>, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. If the windpipe <b>was cracked</b> along its length, <b>Rav said: Even</b> if <b>only one</b> undamaged <b>segment remains in</b> the windpipe <b>above</b> the crack <b>and one segment below</b> it, the animal is <b>kosher.</b>
The Sages <b>said</b> this statement <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who <b>said: What</b> is this <b>segment and what</b> is that <b>segment that Rav says?</b> Segments are immaterial to the matter. <b>Rather, say: Even if any amount remained</b> intact <b>in</b> the windpipe <b>above</b> the crack, <b>and any amount below,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b>
The Sages <b>said this</b> statement in Eretz Yisrael <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rabbi Yonatan</b> the Babylonian, i.e., that any amount of undamaged tissue above and below the crack renders the animal kosher. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to them,</b> excitedly: Do <b>our Babylonian friends know how to interpret in accordance with this explanation?</b> He was happy that Rabbi Yonatan interpreted it the same way he did.
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef taught before Rabbi Yoḥanan: The entire neck is fit for slaughter, from the large</b> uppermost <b>ring</b> of the windpipe downward <b>until the lower edges of the lung. Rava says</b> that the phrase: <b>Lower</b> edges of the lung, is referring to an animal hung by the feet; <b>that is,</b> it actually denotes the <b>upper</b> edges nearest the head. <b>As I say</b> that the area fit for slaughter is <b>all</b> the length of <b>the neck that</b> an animal <b>extends</b> in order to <b>graze, provided that it is not forced</b> to extend its neck further than it wishes. Consequently, the very bottom of the neck is not a location fit for slaughter.
<b>Rav Ḥanina, and some say Rav Ḥananya, raises a dilemma:</b> If the animal <b>forced itself</b> and extended its neck, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the additional area? The Gemara responds: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish sat</b> together, and <b>a matter emerged from between them:</b> If the slaughterer <b>forced</b> the animal to extend <b>the <i>simanim</i></b> by stretching the neck <b>and slaughtered</b> the animal at the lower end of the neck, the slaughter is <b>not valid.</b> And if <b>the windpipe was perforated below the breast, it is considered</b> to be <b>like</b> a perforated <b>lung,</b> which renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> no matter the size of the perforation. A perforation in the upper windpipe must be the size of an <i>issar</i> to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i> (see 54a).
The Gemara elaborates: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which is the breast</b> that must be given to the priests as a gift from every peace offering (see Leviticus 7:31)? <b>This</b> is the section <b>that faces the ground,</b> not the ribbed area on the sides. And lengthwise it extends <b>below,</b> when the animal is hung from the legs, <b>until the neck,</b> and <b>above until the rumen.</b> One <b>cuts the two ribs</b> nearest the head <b>from the two sides</b> of the animal <b>from both directions, and this is the breast that is given to the priests.</b>
§ The mishna states: If <b>the membrane of the brain was perforated,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara cites <b>Rav and Shmuel, who both say:</b> The brain is covered by two membranes, a thick outer membrane adjacent to the skull and a thin inner membrane adjacent to the brain. The animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if <b>the outer membrane</b> was perforated, <b>even if the inner</b> membrane <b>was not perforated. And some say</b> that the animal is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>unless the inner</b> membrane <b>was perforated</b> as well. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says: And</b> this is <b>your mnemonic</b> to remember the <i>halakha</i>: The <b>bag in which the brain rests,</b> i.e., the inner membrane.
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> Even though the inner membrane of the brain is very thin and not easily visible, <b>its equivalent in the testicles,</b> which are also enclosed in a thin membrane, <b>is conspicuous,</b> as it has an appearance different from the testicles themselves. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says in the name of bar Kappara:</b> With regard to the <b>brain, everything inside the skull is considered</b> part of <b>the brain.</b> From the point where it <b>begins to extend</b> like a cord out of the base of the skull, it <b>is considered the spinal cord. And from where does it begin to be extended? Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani said: It was explained to me</b> personally <b>by Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> himself: Protrusions <b>similar</b> to <b>two</b>

Daf 45b

<b>beans lie at the opening of the skull,</b> where the spinal cord exits. <b>From the beans inward,</b> the nerve tissue is considered <b>like the inside,</b> i.e., the brain. Therefore, if its membrane is perforated, even minimally, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>From the beans outward,</b> the nerve tissue is considered <b>like the outside,</b> i.e., the spinal cord. A perforation of the membrane in this area renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> only if the spinal cord is mostly cut. <b>And</b> with regard to the area of <b>the beans themselves, I do not know</b> what the <i>halakha</i> is; <b>but it stands to reason</b> that it is considered <b>like the inside.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya inspected a bird and found</b> protrusions <b>similar</b> to <b>two beans lying on the opening of the skull.</b>
§ The mishna states: If <b>the heart was perforated to its chamber,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> Is the mishna referring <b>to</b> the <b>small chamber</b> within the heart <b>or to</b> the <b>large chamber? Abaye said to him: What is your dilemma? Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna with regard to the lung: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> It is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>unless it is perforated</b> through <b>to the bronchi? And Rabba bar Taḥlifa says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Rabbi Shimon means that it is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>unless it is perforated</b> through <b>to the large bronchus.</b> If so, it may be presumed that the mishna is referring to the large chamber of the heart as well.
The Gemara responds: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> the mishna <b>teaches: To the bronchi [<i>simponot</i>],</b> in the plural form, i.e., the one bronchus <b>into which all the bronchi [<i>simponot</i>] empty</b> out. <b>But here,</b> with regard to the heart, it <b>teaches: To the chamber. What</b> is it <b>to me</b> if this is <b>a large chamber</b> and <b>what</b> is it <b>to me</b> if it is <b>a small chamber?</b> The language does not indicate one or the other.
§ With regard to the <b>aorta,</b> the chief artery exiting the heart, <b>Rav says:</b> Like the heart itself, if it is perforated <b>in any amount</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> The animal is a <i>tereifa</i> only if the aorta is perforated <b>in its majority.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> blood vessel <b>is the aorta? Rabba bar Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> This is the artery found in the <b>fat on the sides.</b> The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> to say that this is referring to the <b>sides</b> of the animal, i.e., the ribs, which are not adjacent to the heart? <b>Rather,</b> this is referring to the artery covered in fat <b>that</b> exits the heart and passes <b>on the sides of the lung.</b>
<b>Ameimar says in the name of Rav Naḥman: There are three ducts</b> adjacent to one another in an animal’s chest. <b>One separates to the heart, and one separates to the lung, and one separates to the liver.</b> The duct <b>of the lung</b> is treated <b>like the lung,</b> and renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> if perforated in any amount. The duct <b>of the liver</b> is treated <b>like the liver,</b> and only if it is completely missing does it render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, in accordance with the mishna. As for the duct <b>of the heart,</b> the aorta, Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree</b> as to the measure of its perforation, as mentioned above.
<b>Mar bar Ḥiyya teaches the opposite:</b> The duct <b>of the lung</b> is treated <b>like the liver</b> and renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> only if it is completely missing. The duct <b>of the liver</b> is treated <b>like the lung,</b> and a perforation of any amount renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. And with regard to the duct <b>of the heart,</b> Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef went and stated the <i>halakha</i> of Rav,</b> that an aorta perforated in any amount renders an animal a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>before Shmuel.</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: If Abba,</b> i.e., Rav, actually <b>said so, he knows nothing at all about <i>tereifot</i>.</b>
§ The mishna states: If <b>the spinal</b> column <b>was broken</b> and its cord was cut, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. With regard to this <b>the Sages taught:</b> If <b>the spinal cord was cut in its majority,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says:</b> It is a <i>tereifa</i> <b>even</b> if the spinal cord was only <b>perforated.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>ruled in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov</b> that even a small perforation of the spinal cord renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And how much is</b> considered <b>a majority of</b> the spinal cord to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>Rav says: A majority of</b> the circumference of <b>its</b> surrounding membranes, the <b>meninges. And some say a majority of the nerve tissue of</b> the spinal cord itself. In other words, even if the meninges are intact, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if a majority of the nerve tissue is cut.
The Gemara notes: According to <b>the one who says</b> that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if <b>a majority of the nerve tissue</b> is severed, <b>all the more so</b> if <b>a majority of the meninges</b> is cut, since if the meninges, the protective membranes, are damaged, the nerve tissue itself will certainly be damaged soon thereafter. But <b>according to the one who says</b> that a tear in <b>a majority of the meninges</b> renders it a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in a case where only <b>a majority of the nerve tissue</b> was cut? Perhaps the intact membranes will keep the damage from spreading.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof: <b>As Nayyoli says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says: The majority of</b> the spinal cord, <b>which they said</b> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> if cut, is <b>the majority of</b> the <b>meninges.</b> But <b>this nerve tissue makes no difference.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Natan bar Avin was sitting before Rav.</b> Rav Natan first <b>checked</b> the spinal cord to make sure that <b>a majority of</b> the <b>meninges</b> was intact, <b>and</b> then <b>was checking</b> to see that <b>a majority of its nerve tissue</b> was intact. Rav <b>said to him: If a majority of</b> the <b>meninges is intact, this nerve tissue makes no difference.</b>
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> If the spinal cord <b>was liquefied [<i>nitmareikh</i>],</b> the animal is <b>unfit</b> for consumption. Even if it <b>softened [<i>nitmasmeis</i>],</b> the animal is <b>unfit,</b> i.e., a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>What is liquefaction, and what is softening? Liquefaction</b> is <b>any</b> case in <b>which</b> the nerve tissue becomes liquid, and if the membrane is punctured it can be <b>poured</b> out <b>like</b> water from <b>a jug. Softening</b> is <b>any</b> case in <b>which</b> the nerve tissue <b>cannot stand</b> upright on its own and sags when it is not being supported.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> In a case where the spinal cord became unusually heavy such that it <b>cannot stand</b> upright <b>due to its weight,</b> but not due to softening or melting, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. <b>In the study hall they say:</b> If the spinal cord <b>softened</b> due to disease, the animal is <b>unfit</b> for consumption. But if some of its tissue softened and <b>was emptied</b> from the spinal cord, the animal remains <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: An animal whose nerve tissue was emptied [<i>nitmazmez</i>]</b> from the spinal cord <b>is a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> version of the <i>baraita</i> is incorrect. In fact, the word <b>softened [<i>nitmasmes</i>] was stated,</b> not the word emptied.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so,</b> that an animal whose nerve tissue has dissolved is kosher? <b>But didn’t</b> it happen that <b>Levi was sitting in the bathhouse,</b> where <b>he saw a certain man who banged his head</b> severely, whereupon <b>he said: This</b> man’s <b>nerve tissue has</b> softened and <b>been emptied?</b> Is it <b>not</b> that Levi meant <b>that</b> the man <b>cannot live?</b> If so, the softening and emptying of the nerve tissue should render an animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Abaye said: No,</b> he intended <b>to say that</b> the man <b>cannot reproduce,</b> since head trauma might lead to infertility.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>Until where</b> does the <b>spinal cord</b> extend downward, such that if it is cut above that point the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Until</b> the point <b>between the branches</b> of the spinal cord that split off behind the thighs.
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rav Dimi bar Yitzḥak wanted to go to Bei Ḥozai. He came before Rabbi Yehuda</b> and <b>said to him: Master, show me, where</b> is the area <b>between the branches</b> to which Shmuel referred? Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him: Go bring me a kid and I will show you.</b> Rav Dimi bar Yitzḥak <b>brought him</b> a choice <b>kid</b> with much <b>fat.</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> The location <b>is buried very</b> deep in the fat <b>and</b> is <b>not recognizable. He brought</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>a lean</b> kid. Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> The bones <b>jut out very</b> far, <b>and</b> the location is <b>not recognizable.</b>
Rabbi Yehuda <b>said to him: Come, I will teach you a tradition</b> without showing you: <b>This</b> is what <b>Shmuel said:</b> There are three successive points around the same bone behind the pelvis at which branches diverge from the spinal cord. If the spinal cord is cut anywhere <b>until the first</b> gap between these branches, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> If it is severed anywhere after <b>the third</b> gap, i.e., after the third branch, the animal is <b>kosher.</b> If it was severed within the <b>second</b> gap, i.e., between these areas, <b>I do not know</b> the <i>halakha</i>.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, raises a dilemma:</b>

Daf 46a

When Shmuel says that the animal is certainly a <i>tereifa</i> if the spinal cord is cut anywhere <b>until</b> the first gap, does he mean <b>until and including</b> the first gap, in which case if it is cut within the first gap the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>Or perhaps</b> he means <b>until and not including</b> the length of the gap itself?
<b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: If you say</b> that Shmuel means <b>until and not including</b> the length of the first gap, and if the spinal cord is cut in the first gap the <i>halakha</i> is unknown, then if the spinal cord was cut in <b>the mouth of</b> the first <b>branch,</b> exactly where it branches off, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered to be within the first gap, in which case the <i>halakha</i> is unknown? Or is it considered before the gap, in which case a tear in the mouth renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>?
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma: If you say</b> that Shmuel means <b>until and including the measure</b> of the first gap, and if the spinal cord is cut in the first gap the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, then if the first <b>branch itself,</b> i.e., the first pair of branching nerves, was cut from the spinal cord, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The branch</b> of the spine that was cut <b>shall be considered as</b> normal <b>flesh,</b> not as the spine. Therefore, it does not render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, unlike the spinal cord itself. <b>What, is it not</b> referring even to the <b>first or second branch?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring only to the <b>third</b> branch. But if either of the first two pairs of nerves that branch off from the spinal cord are cut, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>With regard to a bird,</b> the Sages disagreed as to the lower boundary of the spinal cord, above which if it is cut, the bird will be rendered a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> The spinal cord extends until <b>below the</b> level of the <b>wings. And Reish Lakish says: Until</b> the point <b>between the wings,</b> not below them.
<b>Ulla says: I was standing before</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>ben Pazi, and they brought before him a bird</b> whose spine had been injured, <b>and he checked until</b> the point <b>between the wings. And</b> at that point a messenger <b>of the house of the <i>Nasi</i> sent for him, and he got up and went, and I do not know if</b> he left <b>because one does not need to check beyond</b> that point, <b>or</b> if <b>due to the honor of the <i>Nasi</i></b> he left without completing the inspection.
§ The mishna states: If <b>the liver was removed</b> and nothing remained of it, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara asks: It follows, <b>therefore,</b> that if <b>anything remained of it,</b> the animal is <b>kosher, even if</b> the remaining piece <b>does not constitute an olive-bulk. But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna on 54a: If <b>the liver was removed and an olive-bulk of it remained,</b> it is <b>kosher?</b> One can infer that if less remained, it is a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> while <b>that</b> mishna later in the chapter is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. This is <b>like that</b> incident in which an amount smaller than an olive-bulk remained of the liver, and <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya discarded it,</b> as he holds that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>but Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>dipped it</b> in a seasoning and ate it. <b>And your mnemonic</b> to remember which Sage maintained which opinion is: <b>The rich are stingy.</b> Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, was wealthy, but he nevertheless did not allow the meat to go to waste.
The Gemara relates that <b>a certain</b> royal <b>army came to Pumbedita,</b> and <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef fled</b> the city, whereupon <b>Rabbi Zeira met them.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to them: Refugees,</b> hear this <i>halakha</i>: The <b>olive-bulk that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> must remain of the liver so the animal will remain kosher must be <b>in the place</b> where the liver connects to the <b>gallbladder. Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> The olive-bulk must be <b>in the place that</b> the liver <b>lives,</b> i.e., is connected to the other organs, under the right kidney. <b>Rav Pappa said: Therefore,</b> in order to satisfy both opinions, <b>we require an olive-bulk in the place of the gallbladder, and we</b> also <b>require an olive-bulk in the place that it lives.</b> Otherwise, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If the olive-bulk that remained was not all in one piece, but rather small pieces that could be <b>gathered</b> together to form the requisite measure, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Alternatively, if it was long and thin <b>like a strip, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> If the <b>olive-bulk</b> was <b>flat,</b> broad but thinner than an olive, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? To all these questions the Gemara responds: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rabbi Zerika asked Rabbi Ami:</b> If the <b>liver was detached</b> from the other organs in numerous places <b>and</b> was <b>attached</b> only <b>to its membranes [<i>betarpasheha</i>],</b> but the liver itself remained intact, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Ami <b>said to him:</b> With regard to the <i>halakha</i>, <b>I do not know what</b> the significance is of <b>this detachment</b> that you mentioned. <b>If</b> you rule <b>according to the one who says</b> that an olive-bulk must remain <b>in the place of the gallbladder, that is</b> the case here. And <b>if</b> you rule <b>according to the one who says</b> that it must be <b>in the place that it lives, that is</b> the case here as well. Consequently, there is no doubt that the animal is kosher.
§ The mishna states: <b>The lung that was perforated</b> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara quotes <b>Rav and Shmuel and Rav Asi, who</b> all <b>say:</b> The mishna is referring specifically to the <b>outer membrane. And some say</b> that they said that the mishna is referring specifically to the <b>inner membrane. Rav Yosef bar Minyumi said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: And your mnemonic</b> should be: The <b>red robe in which the lung rests.</b> The inner membrane is red, while the outer membrane is white, and according to Rav Naḥman, the mishna is referring to the inner membrane.
The Gemara comments: It is <b>obvious</b> that <b>if the outer</b> membrane <b>is perforated but the inner</b> membrane <b>is not perforated, the inner</b> membrane <b>protects</b> the lung, and the animal is kosher. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabba, as Rabba says: This</b> animal with <b>a lung whose</b> outer membrane <b>was removed,</b>

Daf 46b

so that it looks <b>like a red date,</b> is <b>kosher;</b> all the more so is that the case if it was only perforated. But if <b>the inner</b> membrane <b>was perforated but the outer</b> membrane <b>was not perforated,</b> does the outer membrane <b>protect</b> the lung? <b>Or</b> does it <b>not protect</b> it, in which case the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>?
<b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree with regard to</b> this question. <b>One says:</b> It <b>does not protect</b> the lung; <b>and one says:</b> It <b>protects</b> the lung. <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that it <b>protects</b> the lung, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Yosef. As Rav Yosef says:</b> With regard to <b>this lung that emits a sound</b> when inflated, <b>if we know</b> from <b>where it emits a sound, we set a feather, or saliva, or straw on</b> that point. <b>If</b> the saliva <b>bubbles</b> when the lung is inflated, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> since this proves that the lung is perforated through both membranes. <b>And if not,</b> the animal is <b>kosher. And if we do not know</b> from <b>where it emits a sound, we bring a basin of tepid water and set</b> the lung <b>inside it.</b>
One <b>cannot</b> place it <b>in hot water, as it causes</b> the lung <b>to contract,</b> closing the perforation. And one <b>cannot</b> place it <b>in cold water, as it hardens</b> the lung and may cause it to crack. <b>Rather, we set it in tepid water and inflate it. If</b> the water <b>bubbles,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And if not,</b> the animal is <b>kosher,</b> since it is apparent that only <b>the inner</b> membrane <b>is perforated</b> and <b>the outer</b> membrane <b>is not perforated, and the</b> fact <b>that it emits a sound is</b> due to <b>the air</b> moving in the space <b>between</b> the two membranes. Evidently, Rav Yosef holds that if only the inner membrane is perforated, the animal is kosher.
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> to remember the following statements of Rava with regard to the lung: <b>Dates, red, that dried, scabbed.</b>
The Gemara turns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> mentioned above: <b>Rava says: This</b> animal with <b>a lung whose</b> outer <b>membrane was removed</b> so that it looks <b>like a red date</b> is <b>kosher. And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a lung</b> whose outer membrane <b>reddened</b> due to bleeding of the lung, if only <b>part of it</b> turned red, then the animal is <b>kosher,</b> but if <b>all of it</b> turned red, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
<b>Ravina said to Rava: What is the reason</b> that the animal is kosher if only <b>part of</b> the outer membrane reddened? Presumably, it is <b>because</b> the animal eventually <b>recovers</b> from the wound. But even if <b>all of it</b> turned red <b>as well,</b> the animal <b>recovers. Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one injures one of the eight impure creeping creatures mentioned in the Torah, one is liable for desecrating Shabbat; <b>but</b> if one injures <b>other repugnant creatures and creeping animals,</b> one is not liable <b>until blood leaves their</b> body as a result of the injury, even if their skin reddens as a result of internal bleeding?
<b>And if you would say: We compare</b> the lung <b>to</b> one of the <b>eight creeping creatures, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>the blood collected</b> under the skin of one of the eight creeping creatures, <b>even if it did not leave</b> the body, one is liable for desecrating Shabbat, because the blood will not be reabsorbed into the body and the wound is permanent; that is difficult: <b>If so,</b> then there is still no reason to distinguish between part of the lung and all of it, and <b>even</b> if only <b>part of</b> the lung turned red, the animal should be rendered a <i>tereifa</i> <b>as well,</b> because the blood will not be reabsorbed into the body. <b>Rather, there is no difference</b> between the reddening of part or all of the lung.
<b>And Rava says:</b> If <b>part of the lung was dried,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And how much</b> must the lung be dried so as to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>Rav Pappi says in the name of Rava:</b> It must be <b>so</b> dry <b>that it can be crumbled with a fingernail.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this statement? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam? As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 37a): If a kosher firstborn animal has a blemish, such as a dried ear, it may be slaughtered outside the Temple. <b>What is a dried</b> ear? It is any ear <b>that if perforated does not bleed a drop. Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam says:</b> It must be <b>so dry that it can be crumbled with a fingernail.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the statement is in accordance with the opinion of the <b>Rabbis. With regard to the ear of a firstborn, which is exposed to the wind,</b> the Rabbis hold that the animal <b>would not recover</b> if it is so dry that it does not bleed. <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>lung, which is not exposed to the wind,</b> the animal <b>would recover</b> unless it is so dry that it can be crumbled with a fingernail. <b>And Rava says: This lung that stands</b> before us <b>covered</b> in <b>scabs,</b> or covered in <b>black</b> marks, or covered in sores with different <b>appearances,</b> is nevertheless <b>kosher.</b>
§ <b>Ameimar says in the name of Rava: One may not compare cysts</b> of the lungs. If one finds a perforated cyst on the lung, but does not know whether it was perforated before or after slaughter, he may not perform a test by perforating another cyst in order to compare their appearances.
<b>And Rava says: These two lobes</b> of the lung <b>that adhere to one another</b> by thin strands <b>have no</b> need for <b>inspection,</b> since it is certain that these adhesions arose due to a perforation of the lung, rendering the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara adds: <b>And we said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to adhesions <b>that are out of order,</b> where a lobe adhered to a non-adjacent lobe. <b>But</b> with regard to adhesions that are <b>in order, that is their</b> normal manner of <b>growth,</b> and the animal is kosher.

Daf 47a

<b>And Rava says: These two cysts that are adjacent to one another</b> on the lung <b>have no</b> need for <b>inspection.</b> The animal is definitely a <i>tereifa</i>, since it is presumed that the cysts formed around a perforation in the lung. But if there is only <b>one</b> cyst that <b>looks like two,</b> due to a depression in the middle, <b>we bring a thorn and pierce it</b> to remove the fluid inside. <b>If</b> the fluids from either side <b>empty into one another,</b> this indicates that <b>it is one</b> cyst, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>kosher. And if not, they are two</b> separate cysts, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
§ <b>And Rava says: The lung has five lobes [<i>unnei</i>].</b> When the animal hangs by its legs with <b>its face toward the person</b> checking it, he sees <b>three</b> lobes <b>on</b> his <b>right and two on</b> his <b>left.</b> If the animal is <b>missing</b> a lobe <b>or</b> has <b>an extra</b> lobe, <b>or</b> if the lobes were <b>switched,</b> with two on the right and three on the left, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>a certain</b> lung that <b>had an extra</b> lobe <b>was brought before Mareimar. Rav Aḥa was sitting at the door</b> of Mareimar’s house. When the animal’s owner was leaving, Rav Aḥa <b>said to him: What did</b> Mareimar <b>say to you?</b> The man <b>said to him:</b> Mareimar <b>deemed it kosher.</b> Rav Aḥa was surprised by this, because it contradicts Rava’s statement, so <b>he said to him: Turn around</b> and <b>bring</b> the animal <b>before him.</b> The owner did so. Mareimar realized why he was being asked twice, and <b>said to him: Go tell whomever is sitting at the door: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava in</b> the case of an animal that has <b>an extra</b> lobe.
The Gemara adds: <b>And this statement</b> applies only <b>when</b> the extra lobe <b>stands in line with the</b> other <b>lobes,</b> on the left or right. <b>But</b> if it is <b>in between</b> the two sides, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>a certain</b> animal with an extra lobe <b>in between</b> the two sides <b>was brought before Rav Ashi. Rav Ashi thought to deem it a <i>tereifa</i>. Rav Huna Mar bar Avya said to him: All those animals</b> that graze <b>outside</b> in the fields <b>have</b> extra lobes like <b>this, and butchers call it the little rose lobe.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>And this statement</b> applies only when the extra lobe is on the <b>inside</b> face of the lung, facing the heart.

Daf 47b

<b>But</b> if it is <b>on the back</b> of the lung, <b>even</b> if it is as small <b>as a myrtle leaf,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
§ <b>Rafram says: This lung that is similar to a chip</b> of wood renders the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the similarity lies <b>in</b> its <b>appearance,</b> i.e., if it is pale like wood. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that it lies <b>in</b> its <b>feeling,</b> i.e., if it is hard like wood. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say that it is swollen. And there are</b> those <b>who say that it is light. And there are</b> those <b>who say that it is</b> completely <b>smooth, that it has no sectioning of lobes.</b>
§ <b>Rava says:</b> If the lung assumed a dark color <b>like eye shadow,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b> If its color is black <b>like ink,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. As Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> Menstrual blood that appears <b>black is</b> actually <b>red, except that it decayed.</b> Black color is therefore a sign of decay, and the lung is assumed to be defective.
The Gemara continues: If the lung was <b>green,</b> the animal is <b>kosher,</b> as can be derived <b>from</b> the episode <b>of Rabbi Natan.</b> And if it was <b>red,</b> it is <b>kosher,</b> as can be derived <b>from</b> the episode <b>of Rabbi Natan. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan says: Once I went to the cities overseas,</b> where <b>one woman came before me who circumcised her first son and he died,</b> and she circumcised her <b>second</b> son <b>and he died,</b> and out of concern that circumcising her <b>third</b> son might cause him to die as well, <b>she brought him before me. I saw that he was red,</b> so <b>I said to her: My daughter, wait for him until his blood is absorbed into him. She waited for him until</b> his blood was absorbed into him <b>and</b> then <b>circumcised him, and he survived. And they would call him Natan the Babylonian after my name.</b> This incident indicates that a red lung can heal.
Rabbi Natan further related: <b>And on another occasion I went to the state of Cappadocia,</b> and <b>a woman came before me who circumcised her first son and he died,</b> and she circumcised her <b>second</b> son <b>and he died.</b> Out of concern that circumcising her <b>third</b> son might cause him to die as well, <b>she brought him before me. I saw that he was green,</b> i.e., pale. <b>I looked at him and</b> saw that <b>he did not have the blood of circumcision in him,</b> i.e., he had a deficiency of blood such that no blood would emerge from the circumcision. <b>I said to her: My daughter, wait until his blood enters him. She waited for his</b> blood to increase <b>and</b> then <b>circumcised him, and he survived. And they would call his name Natan the Babylonian after my name.</b> This incident indicates that a green lung can heal as well.
<b>Rav Kahana says:</b> If the lung has an appearance <b>like the liver,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b> If it has an appearance <b>like flesh,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And your mnemonic</b> to remember that the latter is a <i>tereifa</i> is the verse: “You shall not eat any <b>flesh that is torn of animals [<i>tereifa</i>] in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30).
<b>Rav Sama, son of Rava, says: This lung</b> whose appearance <b>resembles dodder, or saffron, or</b> has a yellow color <b>such as</b> that of <b>an egg</b> yolk, renders the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Since all of these appearances are various shades of green, the Gemara asks: <b>But the green</b> lung <b>that is kosher, what is it like?</b> The Gemara responds: It is <b>like a leek.</b>
§ <b>Ravina says:</b> If there was <b>a sealed</b> area <b>in the lung</b> that does not inflate, <b>we bring a knife and tear it open. If there is pus in</b> the sealed area, then <b>it</b> was <b>definitely</b> sealed <b>due to the pus, and</b> the animal is <b>kosher. But if</b> we do <b>not</b> find pus there, <b>we lay a feather or saliva on</b> the opening and inflate the lung. <b>If</b> the saliva <b>bubbles</b> or the feather moves, the animal is <b>kosher,</b> since some air does reach the area, <b>and if not,</b> there is some defect in the lung, and the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef says: A membrane that appeared due to a wound in the lung,</b> i.e., a scab that covered a perforation through the lung, <b>is not</b> considered a true <b>membrane,</b> since it does not last. <b>And Rav Yosef says:</b> With regard to <b>this lung that emits a sound</b> when inflated, <b>if we know</b> from <b>where it emits a sound, we set a feather, or straw, or saliva on</b> that point. <b>If</b> the saliva <b>bubbles</b> when the lung is inflated, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> since this proves that the lung is perforated through both membranes. <b>And if not,</b> the animal is <b>kosher. And if we do not know</b> from where <b>it</b> emits a sound, <b>we bring a basin of tepid water and set</b> the lung <b>inside it.</b>
One <b>cannot</b> place it <b>in hot water, as it</b> causes the lung to <b>contract,</b> closing the perforation. And one <b>cannot</b> place it <b>in cold water, as it hardens</b> the lung and may cause it to crack. <b>Rather, we check it in tepid water. If</b> the water <b>bubbles,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And if not,</b> the animal is <b>kosher,</b> since it is apparent that only <b>the inner</b> membrane <b>is perforated</b> and <b>the outer</b> membrane <b>is not perforated, and the</b> fact <b>that it emits a sound is</b> due to <b>the air</b> moving in the space <b>between</b> the two membranes.
§ <b>Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> An animal with <b>a lung that</b> liquefied and can be <b>poured</b> out <b>like</b> water from <b>a jug</b> is <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>Evidently,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds</b> that <b>a deficiency on the inside</b> of an organ <b>is not considered a deficiency.</b> Only a deficiency in the wall or membrane of an organ renders an animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Rabbi Abba raised an objection to Ulla</b> from the mishna, which states: <b>The lung that was perforated or that was missing</b> a piece renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>What</b> is the case of a lung that was <b>missing</b> a piece? <b>If we say</b> that it was missing a piece <b>on the outside, this is</b> the same as if it <b>was perforated,</b> since any missing piece of the lung wall would constitute a perforation. <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a missing piece <b>on the inside?</b> If so, <b>learn from</b> the mishna that <b>a deficiency on the inside</b> of an organ <b>is considered a deficiency</b> to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the mishna <b>actually</b> is referring to a missing piece <b>on the outside. And</b> with regard to <b>that which you said: This is</b> the same as if it <b>was perforated,</b> one may respond that <b>no,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to mention both cases to account <b>for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> in the mishna, <b>who says:</b> It is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>until</b> the lung <b>is perforated</b> through <b>to the bronchi.</b> By mentioning both cases, the mishna teaches that <b>this statement</b> of Rabbi Shimon applies only to a small <b>perforation that does not constitute a deficiency. But</b> in the case of <b>a perforation</b> so large <b>that</b> it <b>constitutes a deficiency, even Rabbi Shimon concedes</b> that it renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> even if the perforation does not reach the bronchi.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ḥananya became sick. Rabbi Natan and all the eminent</b> scholars <b>of the generation entered before him</b> to visit. <b>They brought before him a lung that</b> could be <b>poured</b> out <b>like</b> water from <b>a jug, and he deemed</b> the animal <b>kosher.</b>
<b>Rava said: This</b> is the <i>halakha</i> only if the <b>bronchi</b> still <b>exist</b> and only the flesh of the lung has liquefied. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: From where do we know</b> whether the bronchi still exist? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: We bring</b> a glazed <b>earthenware vessel</b> with no cracks, so the contents can be observed, <b>and we pour</b> the lung <b>into it. If there are white streaks in it,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> as the white streaks are remains of the liquefied bronchi. <b>And if not,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman says: If the lung</b> was partially <b>atrophied</b> and only part of the flesh remains, <b>but its membrane</b> still <b>exists,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If the lung was atrophied, but its membrane</b> still <b>exists, even</b> if the space vacated by the atrophied lung can <b>hold a quarter-</b><i>log</i> of fluid, the animal is <b>kosher.</b>

Daf 48a

If <b>its womb was removed,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b> If <b>its liver became infested by worms,</b> with regard to <b>this</b> there <b>was an incident, and the residents of Asia</b> Minor <b>went up</b> on <b>three occasions to</b> the great Sanhedrin in <b>Yavne</b> to inquire with regard to the <i>halakha</i>. On the first two occasions they did not receive an answer; on <b>the third occasion,</b> after the Sanhedrin had deliberated, <b>they permitted</b> the animal <b>to them.</b>
§ <b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> With regard to <b>a lung that is adjacent,</b> i.e., attached, <b>to the</b> ribs in the chest <b>wall, one</b> need <b>not be concerned about</b> the possibility that <b>it</b> became attached as a result of a perforation in the lung as opposed to some injury to the chest wall. But if <b>cysts</b> full of pus <b>sprouted</b> on the lung itself in the area of its attachment to the chest wall, <b>one</b> must be <b>concerned about</b> the possibility that <b>it</b> was perforated, and that this gave rise to the cysts. <b>Mar Yehuda says in the name of Avimi:</b> In <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, whether or not there are cysts on the lung, <b>one</b> must be <b>concerned about</b> the possibility that the lung was perforated.
The Gemara asks: <b>How do we perform</b> an examination to determine whether the injury is in the chest wall or the lung? <b>Rava said: Ravin bar Sheva explained</b> the procedure <b>to me: We bring a knife whose edge is</b> sharp and <b>thin, and we separate</b> the lung from the chest wall. <b>If there is a defect,</b> a wound or disease, <b>in the</b> chest <b>wall, we attribute</b> the attachment <b>to</b> the defect in the chest <b>wall. And if not,</b> we presume that the attachment is <b>due to</b> a defect in <b>the lung, and</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though</b> the lung <b>does not expel air</b> when inflated, since it is assumed that a scab covered the perforation, and a scab does not prevent the animal from being rendered a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Neḥemya, son of Rav Yosef, examined</b> such a lung by inflating it <b>in tepid</b> water to see if bubbles would appear. <b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Huna, son of Rav Pappi, said to Ravina:</b> Concerning <b>this</b> episode <b>of Rav Neḥemya, son of Rav Yosef, you teach it</b> as being <b>about this</b> case of a lung attached to the chest wall. But <b>we teach it</b> as being <b>about</b> the case <b>of Rava, as Rava says: These two lobes</b> of the lung <b>that adhere to one another have no</b> means of <b>inspection to deem them kosher.</b> Still, <b>Rav Neḥemya, son of Rav Yosef, examined</b> such a lung by inflating it <b>in tepid water.</b> If no bubbles appeared he would deem the lung kosher.
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this: What is this?</b> How can an animal with a lung whose lobes adhered to one another be permitted by means of such an inspection? <b>Granted, here,</b> in the case of a lung attached to the chest wall, <b>we attribute</b> the attachment to an injury <b>in the</b> chest <b>wall</b> rather than the lung, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>kosher. But there,</b> in the case of an adhesion between two lobes, what can be said? <b>If this</b> lobe <b>was perforated</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, and if that</b> lobe <b>was perforated</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Even if a scab covers the perforation and prevents bubbles from appearing, the animal is still a <i>tereifa</i>.
Rav Naḥman stated that if there are cysts on the lung in the area of its attachment to the chest wall, one must be concerned about the possibility that the lung was perforated. Evidently, if the lung was perforated, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rav Naḥman</b> really <b>say this? But doesn’t Rav Yosef bar Minyumi say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If the <b>lung was perforated but the</b> chest <b>wall seals</b> the perforation, the animal is <b>kosher?</b> The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult. There,</b> Rav Naḥman is referring to a lung attached to the chest wall <b>in the place that it grows [<i>revita</i>]</b> naturally. In that case, if the chest wall seals the perforation it will remain sealed, and the animal can live. But <b>here,</b> Rav Naḥman is referring to a lung attached to the chest wall <b>not in the place that it grows.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>And where is the place that it grows?</b> It is the area of <b>the sectioning of the lobes,</b> i.e., the front of the lung where the lobes are adjacent to the chest wall on all sides.
§ Since the Gemara cited the statement of Rav Naḥman, the Gemara turns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If the <b>lung was perforated but the</b> chest <b>wall sealed</b> the perforation, the animal is <b>kosher.</b> With regard to this statement, <b>Ravina said: And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> only <b>when</b> the lung <b>is tangled in the flesh</b> of the chest wall, between the ribs. <b>Rav Yosef said to Ravina: And if</b> it is <b>not tangled, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Evidently, we say</b> that the lung <b>is perforated.</b> But <b>if so, when it is tangled as well,</b> it should be deemed a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>As isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a man’s penis was <b>perforated,</b> he is <b>unfit</b> to marry a Jewish woman of fit lineage, <b>because</b> his semen <b>is discharged gently</b> and he cannot procreate, in accordance with the verse: “He that is crushed or maimed in his private parts shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:2). But if the perforation <b>was</b> later <b>sealed</b> with flesh, he is <b>fit, because</b> now <b>he can procreate. And this is</b> an instance of someone who is <b>unfit who returns to his</b> previous state of <b>fitness.</b> Rav Yosef continues: When the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And this is, what does it</b> serve <b>to exclude?</b> Does it <b>not</b> serve <b>to exclude a case like this,</b> where the lung was perforated and then sealed by the chest wall, in which case the animal would not become kosher again?
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the phrase serves <b>to exclude a membrane that appeared due to a wound in the lung, which is not</b> considered <b>a membrane</b> that can seal a perforation, because it is temporary. By contrast, the flesh of the chest wall is considered a permanent seal on the lungs and renders the animal kosher.
<b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama objects to</b> the ruling of Rav Naḥman that if a lung was perforated but the chest wall sealed the perforation, the animal is kosher: <b>If</b> flesh <b>in the</b> chest <b>wall was perforated against</b> the perforation in the lung, <b>what</b> would the <i>halakha</i> be? The animal would be <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> since air can now escape from the lung. Evidently, the question of whether the animal is permitted is dependent on the state of the chest wall. If so, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach,</b> in addition to the given list of <i>tereifot</i>: An animal <b>whose</b> chest <b>wall was perforated.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> one can also ask: The mishna states that if the gallbladder was perforated, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>That which Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> with regard to this, that if the <b>gallbladder was perforated but the liver sealed</b> the perforation the animal is <b>kosher,</b> is difficult. <b>If the liver were perforated against</b> the perforation in the gallbladder, <b>what</b> would the <i>halakha</i> be? The animal would be <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> If so, <b>let</b> the mishna also <b>teach:</b> An animal <b>whose liver was perforated.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> one must say that the mishna <b>does not teach</b> cases <b>where</b> the <b>perforated</b> organ is <b>not</b> the one <b>by which</b> the animal <b>is rendered a <i>tereifa</i>. Here, too,</b> in the case of a lung sealed by the chest wall, <b>since</b> the perforated organ, i.e., the chest wall, is <b>not</b> the one <b>by which</b> the animal <b>is rendered a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> the mishna <b>does not teach</b> it.
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana asked Shmuel:</b> If the lung <b>grew cysts</b> full of pus, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Shmuel <b>said to him:</b> The animal is <b>kosher.</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>said to him</b> in reply: <b>I also say so,</b> that the animal is kosher, <b>except that the students doubt the matter, as Rav Mattana says:</b> If the cyst was <b>full of pus,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>;</b> if it was full of <b>clear fluid,</b> it is <b>kosher.</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: That</b> <i>halakha</i> of Rav Mattana <b>was stated</b> with regard to a cyst <b>on the kidney,</b> not on the lung.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef was walking after Rabbi Yirmeya in the butchers’ market. He saw these</b> lungs <b>that were full of cysts,</b> and he wished to determine the <i>halakha</i> with regard to them. <b>He said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Doesn’t</b> the <b>Master desire a piece of meat?</b> If so, meat from those animals is for sale. Rabbi Yirmeya, not wanting to issue a ruling with regard to the meat, <b>said to him: I have no money.</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef <b>said to him: I will</b> buy them for you on <b>credit.</b> Rabbi Yirmeya realized that he could not avoid issuing a ruling, so <b>he said to him: What can I do for you? As when</b> people <b>came before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> with such lungs, <b>he</b> would <b>send them before Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon, who</b> would <b>instruct</b> them <b>in</b> such cases <b>in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, to permit</b> the meat for consumption. <b>But</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>himself does not hold accordingly,</b> and does not permit the meat. I practice stringency in accordance with his opinion.
<b>Rava said: When we would walk after Rav Naḥman in the market</b>

Daf 48b

<b>of the skinners, and some say in the market of the Sages, he would see</b> these lungs <b>that were full of jugs,</b> i.e., they were covered in large cysts full of liquid, <b>and he</b> would <b>not say anything to</b> the butchers. Evidently, he held that the animals were kosher.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi were passing through the market of Tiberias. They saw these</b> lungs <b>that were full of rocks,</b> i.e., large, hard growths, <b>and they did not say anything to</b> the butchers. Evidently, they held that the animals were kosher.
§ It <b>was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagree with regard to <b>a needle that was found in the lung</b> of a slaughtered animal: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Ḥanina deem</b> the animal <b>kosher,</b> while <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish and Rabbi Mani bar Pattish and Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim deem</b> it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>they disagree about this: That</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., those who deem it a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>a deficiency on the inside</b> of the lung, created by the needle, <b>is considered a deficiency,</b> rendering the animal a <i>tereifa</i>; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., those who deem it kosher, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is not considered a deficiency.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>No, everyone</b> holds that <b>a deficiency on the inside is not considered a deficiency. And here,</b> in the case of a needle, the Sages <b>disagree with regard to this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> i.e., those who deem it kosher, <b>holds</b> that the needle <b>took the respiratory route and came</b> into the lung without perforating the membrane; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., those who deem it a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>it perforated</b> its way out of the digestive system <b>and came</b> through to the lung by perforating its membrane.
The Gemara relates that <b>a certain needle was found in a piece of lung</b> after it had been cut into pieces. People there <b>brought it before Rabbi Ami,</b> and <b>he thought to deem it kosher. Rabbi Yirmeya, and some say Rabbi Zerika, raised an objection to</b> this possible ruling from the mishna: <b>The lung that was perforated or that was missing</b> a piece renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. Now, <b>what</b> is the case of a lung that was <b>missing</b> a piece? <b>If we say</b> that it was missing a piece <b>on the outside, this is</b> the same as if it <b>was perforated,</b> since any missing piece of the lung wall constitutes a perforation. <b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> referring to a missing piece <b>on the inside?</b> If so, <b>learn from</b> the mishna that <b>a deficiency on the inside</b> of an organ <b>is considered a deficiency,</b> and the needle certainly caused a deficiency inside the lung.
Rabbi Ami did not decide the matter, so <b>they then sent</b> the lung <b>before Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa. He,</b> too, <b>thought to deem it kosher. Rabbi Yirmeya, and some say Rabbi Zerika, raised an objection to this</b> from the mishna: <b>The lung that was perforated or that was missing</b> a piece renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. Now, <b>what</b> is the case of a lung that was <b>missing</b> a piece? <b>If we say</b> that it was missing a piece <b>on the outside, this is</b> the same as if it <b>was perforated. Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> referring to a missing piece <b>on the inside?</b> If so, <b>learn from</b> the mishna that <b>a deficiency on the inside</b> of an organ <b>is considered a deficiency.</b>
<b>They then sent</b> the lung <b>back before Rabbi Ami, and he deemed</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. They said to him: But don’t the Rabbis,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rabbi Elazar, and Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>deem it kosher?</b> Rabbi Ami <b>said to them: They deemed it kosher since they knew for which reason they deemed it kosher.</b> They were confronted with a whole lung and could see that it had no perforation. But <b>we, for which reason shall we deem it kosher?</b> We see only part of the lung. <b>Perhaps if the</b> whole <b>lung was before us</b> we would see that its membrane <b>was perforated.</b>
The Gemara asks: One can infer that the <b>reason</b> he deemed it a <i>tereifa</i> is <b>that</b> the entire lung <b>was not</b> before him, <b>but</b> if it <b>had been</b> before him <b>and</b> the membrane <b>had not been perforated,</b> then he would have deemed the animal <b>kosher. But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say: This bronchus of the lung that was perforated</b> renders the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>?</b> Accordingly, even if the needle entered the lung through a bronchus the animal ought to be a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> statement of Rav Naḥman <b>was stated</b> in reference <b>to</b> a case where a needle pierced from one bronchus into <b>another.</b> Since the bronchi are hard, one bronchus cannot seal a perforation in another. By contrast, when a needle perforates the bronchi and continues into the flesh of the lung, soft tissue left behind can seal the perforation.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say:</b> If <b>this spiral colon was perforated against another</b> coil of the intestine, the other coil <b>protects it</b> by sealing the perforation? If so, why does a bronchus not seal a perforation in another bronchus? <b>Rav Ashi said: Are</b> you <b>comparing <i>tereifot</i> to one another? One cannot say with regard to <i>tereifot</i>: This is similar to that, as one cuts</b> an animal <b>from here,</b> in one place, <b>and it dies,</b> while <b>one cuts it from there,</b> in another place, <b>and it lives.</b>
The Gemara recounts the case of <b>a certain needle that was found in the large,</b> i.e., main, <b>bronchus of the lung. They brought it before the Rabbis who deem</b> an animal <b><i>tereifa</i></b> if a needle is found in the lungs, i.e., Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Rabbi Mani bar Pattish, and Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim. <b>They did not say</b> that <b>it</b> was <b>prohibited, nor</b> that it was <b>permitted. They did not say it</b> was <b>permitted, in accordance with their ruling,</b> but <b>they also did not say it</b> was <b>prohibited since</b> the needle <b>was found in the large bronchus,</b> and one can therefore <b>say</b> that it likely <b>took the respiratory route and came</b> into the lung rather than perforating through from the digestive system.
§ The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain needle that was found in a piece of liver. Mar, son of Rav Yosef, thought to deem</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Rav Ashi said to him: If</b> a needle <b>had been found in the flesh, like this case</b> where it was found in the liver, <b>would</b> the <b>Master have deemed it a <i>tereifa</i>?</b> A perforated liver, like perforated flesh, does not in itself render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, as is evident from the mishna (42a). <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said</b> that <b>we see: If the eye</b> of the needle faces <b>outward,</b> toward the stomach cavity, one must presume that <b>it perforated</b> its way out of the gullet, rendering the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>and</b> thereby <b>came</b> to the liver. <b>If the eye</b> of the needle faces <b>inward,</b> buried in the liver, and the sharp end of the needle is facing outward, one may presume that <b>it took hold of</b> a blood <b>vessel and came</b> to the liver through it, rather than through the gullet, and the animal is kosher.
The Gemara adds: <b>And this statement</b> applies only <b>to a thick</b> needle, the eye of which is not sharp enough to cause a perforation by itself. <b>But</b> if the needle is <b>thin,</b> it <b>is no different if the eye</b> faces <b>inward</b> and it <b>is no different if the eye</b> faces <b>outward,</b> and one must presume that <b>it perforated</b> its way out of the gullet <b>and</b> thereby <b>came</b> to the liver.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> that of <b>a needle that is found</b>

Daf 49a

embedded <b>in the thickness of</b> the wall of <b>the reticulum,</b> where the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: If the needle protrudes <b>from one side,</b> i.e., the inner side of the stomach wall, the animal is <b>kosher,</b> but if it protrudes <b>from both sides,</b> it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>; and</b> if it protrudes only on the inside <b>we do not say: See if the eye</b> of the needle is facing <b>outward or if the eye</b> of the needle is facing <b>inward?</b> Rather, the animal is deemed kosher even if the eye is facing outward, and that is not considered evidence that the needle perforated through the gullet into the chest cavity and then perforated the thickness of the reticulum.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>There,</b> in the case of the reticulum, <b>since there are food and liquid</b> present, one may <b>say that the food and liquid pushed</b> the eye of the needle through the stomach wall. Therefore, even if the eye points outward, one may still presume that the needle came from the inside, and the animal is kosher.
The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain needle that was found in the large duct of a liver. Huna Mar, son of Rav Idi, deemed</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> while <b>Rav Adda bar Minyumi deemed it kosher. They came</b> and <b>asked Ravina</b> about the issue, and <b>he said to them: Take the robe of those who deemed it a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> They must pay restitution to the owner of the animal, who was wrongfully forced to discard his kosher meat.
The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain</b> date <b>pit that was found in a gallbladder. Rav Ashi said: When we were in the house of Rav Kahana</b> as students, <b>he would say</b> with regard to such a case: <b>This</b> date pit <b>certainly took</b> the route <b>of</b> the <b>duct</b> connecting the liver and gallbladder <b>and came</b> through it to the gallbladder, as it is not sharp enough to have perforated the gallbladder from without. <b>Even though it</b> is large enough that it <b>does not exit</b> the gallbladder if one tries to squeeze it into the duct, one may still assume that the movements of the animal’s body gradually <b>cause it to slip</b> through the duct. The Gemara adds: <b>And this statement</b> applies only to the pit <b>of a palm,</b> i.e., of a date, <b>but</b> the pit <b>of an olive</b> is pointed. Therefore, one must be concerned that it <b>has pierced</b> the wall of the gallbladder, rendering the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of the lung: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Why is</b> the lung <b>called <i>rei’a</i></b> in Hebrew? <b>Because it lights up [<i>me’ira</i>] the eyes</b> of one who eats it. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is Rabbi Yoḥanan referring <b>to</b> a lung <b>eaten</b> as is, <b>or</b> is he referring to a lung eaten only <b>through</b> its treatment with certain <b>substances?</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that <b>which Rav Huna bar Yehuda says: A goose</b> may be purchased <b>for a dinar, but its lung</b> may be purchased <b>for four</b> dinars. <b>And if</b> it should <b>enter your mind</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring <b>to eating</b> the lung without treating it, one has no incentive to buy a lung separately for more money. <b>Let him buy</b> the whole goose <b>for a dinar and eat</b> the lung that comes included. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that the lung gains special properties only <b>through</b> treatment with certain <b>substances,</b> and this treatment is the reason for the higher price.
§ The Gemara asks: If <b>the lung is perforated where the hand of the butcher handles</b> it after slaughter, <b>do we attribute</b> the perforation to the butcher’s handling, <b>or do we not attribute</b> the perforation to the handling, in which case the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>Rav Adda bar Natan says: We attribute</b> it to the butcher’s handling, while <b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, says: We do not attribute</b> it to the handling. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>we attribute</b> it to the handling.
<b>Rav Shmuel, son of Rabbi Abbahu, said:</b> My <b>father was</b> one <b>of the heads of the <i>kalla</i></b> lectures of <b>Rafram, and he said: We attribute</b> it to the handling. <b>They said this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>of Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari,</b> who held the opposite, <b>before</b> Rav Shmuel, <b>and he did not accept it.</b>
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya said: It stands to reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Grandfather,</b> i.e., Rav Adda bar Natan, <b>as we attribute</b> perforations <b>to a wolf.</b> If slaughtered meat is recovered from a wolf and found to have a perforation that would have rendered the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, one may attribute the perforation to the wolf and presume that it did not exist beforehand.
Furthermore, if a perforation was caused by <b>a worm [<i>murana</i>], Rav Yosef bar Dosai and the Rabbis disagree. One says</b> that the worm <b>emerged</b> from the lung and perforated it <b>before</b> the <b>slaughter,</b> and the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>and one says</b> that <b>it emerged after</b> the <b>slaughter,</b> and the animal is kosher. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that one presumes that <b>it emerged after</b> the <b>slaughter.</b>
§ The mishna states: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> An animal with a perforated lung is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>until it is perforated</b> through to the bronchi. With regard to this, <b>Rabba bar Taḥlifa says</b> that <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says:</b> Rabbi Shimon meant specifically that it is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>unless it is perforated</b> through <b>to the large bronchus,</b> from which the smaller bronchi branch out.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Aḥa bar Abba sat before Rav Huna, and he was sitting and saying: Rabbi Malokh says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: Are you saying</b> this in the name of <b>Malokh the Arab? He says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with Rabbi Shimon.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>When Rabbi Zeira went up</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rav Beivai, who was sitting and saying: Rabbi Malokh says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him:</b> On the <b>Master’s life, I and Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and Rav Asi visited the place</b> of residence <b>of Rabbi Malokh, and we said to him: Did</b> the <b>Master say that</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon? And he said to us: I said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> Rav Beivai asked Rabbi Zeira: <b>And you, what</b> more do you have <b>in your possession</b> on this matter? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
The Gemara rules: <b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> Any perforation of the membranes of the lung renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
§ The mishna states: If <b>the abomasum was perforated,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. Concerning this, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> With regard to <b>fat that is on the abomasum,</b> the <b>priests accustomed</b> themselves to consider <b>it permitted,</b> and they would eat it along with the rest of the abomasum, which was given to them from non-sacred animals as one of the gifts of the priesthood. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael that he says in the name of his forefathers. And</b> since there is a disagreement between the Sages with regard to this issue, <b>your mnemonic</b> to remember the lenient opinion is the idiom: <b>Yishmael the priest</b> generally <b>helps the priests.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> this, i.e., where does Rabbi Yishmael help the priests? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the priestly benediction: <b>“So you shall bless the children of Israel”</b> (Numbers 6:23). <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: We learn</b> from this verse about <b>a blessing for Israel from the mouth of the priests,</b> but <b>we have not learned</b> about a blessing <b>for the priests themselves. When it says</b> afterward with regard to the priests: “And they shall put My name upon the children of Israel, <b>and I will bless them”</b> (Numbers 6:27), <b>you must say:</b> The <b>priests bless Israel, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, blesses the priests.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> a different interpretation: <b>We learned</b> from the verse about <b>a blessing for Israel from the mouth of the priests,</b> but <b>we have not learned</b> about a blessing for Israel <b>from the mouth of the Almighty. When it says</b> afterward: “And they shall put My name upon the children of Israel, <b>and I will bless them,” you must say: The priests bless Israel, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, affirms their</b> blessing. The word “them” is referring to Israel.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then <b>from where does Rabbi Akiva</b> learn about <b>a blessing for the priests? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> He learns it <b>from</b> God’s promise to Abraham: <b>“And I will bless them that bless you”</b> (Genesis 12:3). All who bless the Jewish people are blessed themselves.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> sense does only Rabbi Yishmael <b>help the priests,</b> given that Rabbi Akiva concedes that the priests are also blessed? The Gemara responds: He helps the priests in the sense <b>that he establishes the blessing for the priests in the</b> same <b>place,</b> the same verse, that one finds <b>the blessing of Israel,</b> indicating that they receive the same blessing.
It was stated that the priests accustomed themselves to permit the fat on the abomasum, in accordance with the statement of <b>Rabbi Yishmael that he says in the name of his forefathers.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> this statement? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states with regard to forbidden fats mentioned in the Torah: <b>“All the fat that is upon the innards”</b> (Leviticus 3:3),

Daf 49b

the word “all” serves <b>to include</b> the <b>fat that is on the small intestines;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The word “all” serves <b>to include</b> the <b>fat that is on the abomasum.</b> According to Rabbi Yishmael, the fat of the abomasum is permitted.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “The fat that covers the innards, and all <b>the fat that is upon the innards”</b> (Leviticus 3:3). <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yishmael, <b>says: Just as the fat that covers the innards</b> possesses <b>a membrane, and</b> that membrane is easily <b>peeled</b> off, <b>so too, all</b> fat possessing <b>a membrane and</b> whose membrane is easily <b>peeled</b> is forbidden, including the fat on the abomasum. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: Just as the fat that covers the innards is spread out</b> loosely over them, and it possesses <b>a membrane, and</b> the membrane is easily <b>peeled</b> off, <b>so too, all</b> fat that is <b>spread out</b> loosely, and possesses <b>a membrane, and</b> whose membrane is easily <b>peeled,</b> e.g., the fat on the intestines, is forbidden. The fat on the abomasum is fixed tightly and is therefore permitted. It would seem from this <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael contradict themselves.
<b>Ravin sent</b> an answer <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Such is the</b> proper <b>layout of the mishna,</b> i.e., the <i>baraita</i>. The latter attribution of the opinions is correct, <b>and</b> one must <b>reverse</b> the attribution of opinions in <b>the first</b> <i>baraita</i>. Accordingly, Rabbi Akiva deems the fat on the intestines prohibited, while Rabbi Yishmael deems the fat on the abomasum prohibited as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>What did you see that</b> led <b>you</b> to <b>reverse the first</b> <i>baraita</i>? Why not <b>reverse the second</b> <i>baraita</i> instead? The Gemara responds: The second <i>baraita</i> <b>here is different, since it teaches</b> using the formula: <b>Just as.</b> Because it takes care to <b>specifically</b> provide the textual justifications for the opinions, it is presumably accurate about the attributions as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> how can Rabbi Oshaya claim above that the priests acted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael? It</b> was actually <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Rabbi Oshaya meant only <b>that</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>says</b> the lenient opinion <b>in the name of his forefathers, but</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>himself does not hold accordingly,</b> and he considers the fat of the abomasum forbidden.
§ The Gemara discusses a connection between the issue of fats and that of <i>tereifot</i>: <b>Rav says: Kosher fat</b> effectively <b>seals</b> a perforation that it covers, and the animal is not rendered a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Non-kosher</b> fat <b>does not</b> effectively <b>seal</b> a perforation, and the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And Rav Sheshet says: Both this and that</b> fat effectively <b>seal</b> a perforation.
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to the <b>fat of an undomesticated animal,</b> all of which is permitted for consumption, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Shall one say that Rav <b>specifically said</b> that <b>kosher fat seals</b> a perforation, <b>and</b> since <b>this too,</b> i.e., all the fat of an undomesticated animal, <b>is kosher,</b> it is all considered an effective seal? <b>Or perhaps</b> Rav specified that permitted fat of a domesticated animal seals a perforation only <b>because it is</b> firmly <b>attached. But this,</b> the fat on the innards of an undomesticated animal, <b>is not</b> firmly <b>attached,</b> and it is not an effective seal, even though it is permitted for consumption.
<b>Abaye said: Why</b> does Rabbi Zeira <b>raise this dilemma? Granted that</b> the fat of the innards is <b>permitted for consumption,</b> but still, <b>it is not</b> firmly <b>attached</b> and clearly does not form an effective seal.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain perforation that was sealed by non-kosher fat that came before Rava. Rava said: With regard to what</b> need <b>we be concerned? First, doesn’t Rav Sheshet say: Non-kosher fat also</b> effectively <b>seals</b> a perforation? <b>And furthermore,</b> in general, <b>the Torah spares the money of the Jewish people,</b> and it is appropriate to rule leniently in this regard. <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava:</b> But there is also the opinion of <b>Rav</b> that non-kosher fat does not seal a perforation, <b>and</b> this dispute concerns <b>a prohibition by Torah law, and</b> yet <b>you say</b> that <b>the Torah spares the money of the Jewish people?</b> One cannot rely on this principle to rule in accordance with the lenient opinion with regard to such matters.
The Gemara relates a similar episode: <b>Manyumin the jug maker</b> had <b>a jug [<i>bisteka</i>]</b> full <b>of honey</b> that <b>was</b> left <b>uncovered,</b> and he was concerned it might have been contaminated by snake venom. <b>He came before Rava</b> to inquire as to the <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rava said: With regard to what</b> need <b>we be concerned? First, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 8:4): <b>Three liquids are prohibited due to exposure: Wine, water, and milk; and all other liquids are permitted.</b> Honey, therefore, is permitted. <b>And furthermore, the Torah spares the money of the Jewish people. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava:</b> But there is also the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> that exposed honey is prohibited, <b>and</b> this dispute concerns a matter of <b>mortal danger, and</b> yet <b>you say</b> that <b>the Torah spares the money of the Jewish people?</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> this opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Five</b> liquids <b>are not</b> subject to the prohibition of <b>exposure,</b> since snakes do not drink from them: <b>Fish brine, vinegar, oil, honey, and fish gravy [<i>morayes</i>]</b> made from fish brine mixed with oil and salt. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even they are</b> subject to prohibition <b>due to exposure. And Rabbi Shimon said: I</b> once <b>saw a snake that drank fish brine in Tzaidan.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> That snake <b>was strange,</b> i.e., it behaved differently than other snakes, <b>and one does not bring a proof from strange</b> creatures.
Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak: <b>Concede to me, at least, with regard to fish brine</b> that it is not prohibited by exposure, <b>as when Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rabbi Yehoshua, and the Sages would have</b> a case of <b>exposure</b> of some liquid, <b>they would cast it into fish brine.</b> The sharpness of the brine neutralizes the snake venom. Accordingly, just as the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon with regard to fish brine, so too it is not in accordance with his opinion with regard to honey. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>said to him: Concede to me, at least, with regard to honey</b> that it is prohibited by exposure, <b>as Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar held in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And likewise, Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar would deem</b> exposed <b>honey prohibited.</b>
The Gemara returns to the initial discussion with regard to fats and perforations: <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> Permitted <b>fat that is made like a hat does not</b> effectively <b>seal</b> a perforation, even though it is permitted for consumption. The Gemara clarifies: <b>Where</b> is this fat? <b>Some say</b> it is the <b>grains</b> of fat found <b>on the rectum,</b> which, if perforated, renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And some say</b> that it is <b>the membrane</b> surrounding <b>the heart,</b> which, if perforated to the chambers, renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
§ <b>Rava said: I heard from Rav Naḥman</b> about <b>two</b> fats found on the abomasum, in different places. One is called the <b><i>ḥimtza</i> and</b> one the <b><i>bar ḥimtza</i>,</b> meaning: Son of <i>ḥimtza</i>. <b>One</b> effectively <b>seals</b> a perforation of the abomasum, <b>and one does not</b> effectively <b>seal</b> a perforation of the abomasum. <b>But I do not know which of them</b> is which. <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana and Rav Huna, son of Rav Naḥman, said:</b> The <b><i>bar ḥimtza</i> seals;</b> the <b><i>ḥimtza</i> does not seal. Rav Tavot said: And your mnemonic</b> is: <b>The power of the son is greater than the power of the father.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Which is the <i>ḥimtza</i> and which is the <i>bar ḥimtza</i>?</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from that <b>which Rav Naḥman says</b> with regard to one of the fats on the abomasum. Can it be that <b>they,</b> the residents of Eretz Yisrael, <b>eat</b> it, considering it permitted for consumption,

Daf 50a

<b>and to us,</b> the residents of Babylonia, not only is it forbidden but <b>it also does not seal</b> a perforation? It cannot be that this fat is forbidden by Torah law if they permit it for consumption. Even though we are stringent with regard to its consumption, we may still maintain that it effectively seals a perforation.
The Gemara explains: The abomasum is shaped like a bow. The side facing outward is curved like the bow itself, while the side facing inward is flat and straight like the bowstring. With regard to the fat <b>that is on the bow, everyone agrees,</b> even the residents of Eretz Yisrael, <b>that it is forbidden</b> for consumption. This fat, then, is the <i>ḥimtza</i>, which does not seal a perforation according to Rav Naḥman. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is with regard to the fat <b>that is on the bowstring.</b> The residents of Eretz Yisrael permit it for consumption, while those of Babylonia prohibit it. According to Rav Naḥman, the residents of Babylonia should concede that it is nevertheless an effective seal. This, then, is the <i>bar ḥimtza</i>.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that with regard to the fat <b>that is on the bowstring, everyone agrees that it is permitted.</b> This, then, is the <i>bar ḥimtza</i>. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is with regard to the fat <b>that is on the bow.</b> The residents of Eretz Yisrael permit it, but the residents of Babylonia prohibit it. This, then, is the <i>ḥimtza</i>.
The Gemara adds: When it was stated that only the residents of Eretz Yisrael permit the fat on the bowstring for consumption, this means that they would eat it in a manner <b>like that which Rav Avya says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> One <b>takes a handful</b> of the fat that lies above the fat on the bowstring, since this is the fat prohibited by the verse: “And all the fat that is upon the innards” (Leviticus 3:3), and the rest is permitted for consumption. <b>And so says Rabbi Yannai,</b> also a resident of Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of a certain elder:</b> One <b>takes a handful. Rav Avya said: I was standing before Rabbi Ami.</b> The people there <b>took a handful</b> of the fat on the bowstring <b>and gave him</b> the remaining fat, <b>and he ate</b> from it.
The Gemara relates: <b>The attendant of Rabbi Ḥanina was standing before Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> a resident of Eretz Yisrael. Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to him: Take</b> off <b>a handful</b> from that fat on the bowstring and <b>give me</b> the rest so <b>that I will eat</b> from it. Rabbi Ḥanina <b>saw that</b> the attendant <b>was hesitating,</b> so <b>he said to him: You are a Babylonian</b> and usually consider all of this fat forbidden. If so, <b>cut</b> off all the fat and <b>throw it</b> away.
§ The mishna states that if the small intestines are perforated, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. With regard to this, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If the <b>intestines were perforated but mucus seals</b> the perforated intestines, the animal is <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this <b>mucus? Rav Kahana said:</b> It is the <b>mucus of the intestines that comes out under pressure,</b> when one scrapes with a knife.
The Gemara relates: <b>The colleagues of Rabbi Abba learned</b> a tradition <b>from Rabbi Abba. And who are they?</b> The phrase: Colleagues of Rabbi Abba, is referring to <b>Rabbi Zeira. And some say the colleagues of Rabbi Zeira</b> learned it <b>from Rabbi Zeira. And who are they? Rabbi Abba.</b> This is the tradition: <b>Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, said</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, and</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>mourning.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>; this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>that we stated</b> above, that mucus forms an effective seal in the intestines. The <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to mourning; what is</b> this <i>halakha</i>? <b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one learns of the death of an immediate relative after other relatives have already begun their period of mourning, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: During <b>the entire first three days</b> of mourning, if a mourner <b>comes</b> to the house of mourning <b>from a nearby place, he counts</b> his days of mourning <b>with</b> the other mourners and completes his mourning with them.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If he came <b>from a distant place, he counts</b> seven days <b>on his own</b> from the time that he was informed of the death. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> i.e., after the first three days, <b>even if he comes from a nearby place, he counts</b> seven days <b>on his own. Rabbi Shimon says: Even on the seventh day,</b> if <b>he comes from a nearby place, he counts</b> and completes his mourning <b>with</b> the other mourners.
<b>Someone</b> whose name was not given <b>said: May I merit to go up</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>and learn this <i>halakha</i> from the mouth of its Master. When he went up</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba,</b> and <b>said to him:</b> Is it true that <b>the Master said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>?</b> Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: This</b> is not true. Rather, <b>I said</b> just the opposite, that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not</b> in accordance with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and even if mucus seals the perforation of the intestine, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>.
The anonymous man asked Rabbi Abba again: <b>What</b> about the other ruling reported in your name, that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to mourning;</b> is this accurate? Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: There are conflicting</b> opinions with regard to this matter, <b>as it was stated</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, <b>and so says Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> That is the <b><i>halakha</i>. But Rav Naḥman says:</b> That is <b>not</b> the <b><i>halakha</i>.</b>
The Gemara concludes: <b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, and</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon with regard to mourning, in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Shmuel,</b> who <b>says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of the</b> more <b>lenient</b> authority <b>in</b> matters relating to <b>mourning.</b>
§ <b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya says: One may compare</b> perforations <b>in the intestines.</b> If one is unsure whether a perforation occurred before or after slaughter, one may make an additional perforation and compare the two. If their appearance is similar, one may conclude that the perforation occurred after slaughter, and the animal is kosher.
The Gemara relates: There were <b>certain</b> perforated <b>intestines that came before Rava.</b> Rava made other perforations and <b>compared them, but they were not similar. Rav Mesharshiyya, his son, came</b> and <b>rubbed</b> the new perforations, <b>and they were similar.</b> Rav Mesharshiyya therefore deemed the animal kosher. Rava <b>said to him: From where</b> did <b>you</b> know to do <b>this?</b> Rav Mesharshiyya <b>said to him:</b> I reasoned: <b>How many hands rubbed these</b> earlier perforations <b>before they came before</b> the <b>Master?</b> Therefore, I thought that if I handled the new ones, perhaps they would look similar. Rava <b>said to him: My son is as wise in</b> matters of <b><i>tereifot</i> as Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>
Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both say: One may compare</b> perforations <b>in the lung</b> to determine whether they occurred after slaughter. <b>Rava said: We said</b> this <b>only</b> when the two perforations are <b>on the same side</b> of the lungs. <b>But</b> one may <b>not</b> compare perforations <b>from</b> one <b>side to the</b> other <b>side.</b> The Gemara rules: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: One may compare <b>even from</b> one <b>side to the</b> other <b>side,</b> and even <b>from a small</b> animal <b>to</b> another <b>small</b> animal, <b>or from a large</b> animal <b>to</b> another <b>large</b> animal, <b>but not from a large</b> animal <b>to a small</b> animal, <b>and not from a small</b> animal <b>to a large</b> animal.
Similarly, <b>Abaye and Rava both say: One may compare</b> severed or perforated areas <b>in the windpipe. Rav Pappa said: We said</b> this <b>only</b> when the two areas are <b>in the same segment</b> of the windpipe. <b>But</b> one may <b>not</b> compare <b>from</b> one <b>segment to</b> another <b>segment.</b> The Gemara rules: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: One may <b>even</b> compare <b>from</b> one <b>segment to</b> another <b>segment, and from</b> one <b>subsegment,</b> i.e., a thin segment between the main segments, <b>to</b> another <b>subsegment, but not from a segment to a subsegment, and not from a subsegment to a segment.</b>
§ <b>Ze’eiri says:</b> If <b>the rectum was perforated,</b> the animal is <b>kosher, since the hips hold it up</b> and seal the perforation. <b>And</b> to <b>how much</b> of the rectum does this apply? <b>Rabbi Ilai says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If the rectum was perforated in <b>the place where</b> it <b>is attached</b> to the hips, even if it was perforated <b>in its majority,</b> the animal is kosher. If the perforation was <b>not in the place where</b> it <b>is attached</b> to the hips, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if it was perforated <b>in any amount.</b>
<b>The Sages said this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>before Rava in the name of Rav Naḥman.</b> Rava <b>said</b> to them: <b>Have I not told you not to hang on</b> Rav Naḥman

Daf 50b

<b>empty bottles,</b> i.e., not to falsely attribute statements to him? <b>So said Rav Naḥman:</b> With regard to <b>the place that</b> the rectum <b>is attached</b> to the hips, <b>even</b> if <b>all of it was removed,</b> the animal is <b>kosher. And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> only <b>where sufficient</b> space <b>remains of it</b> for a hand to <b>grip.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is considered sufficient to grip? <b>Abaye said: The width of a finger.</b> This measure is sufficient even <b>in</b> the case of a large <b>bull.</b>
§ The mishna states that if <b>the internal rumen</b> was perforated or most of the external rumen was torn, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. With regard to this, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Natan bar Sheila, chief butcher of Tzippori, testified before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>in the name of Rabbi Natan: Which is the internal rumen?</b> It is <b>the cecum. And so said Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa:</b> It is <b>the cecum. Rabbi Yishmael said:</b> It is the <b>opening [<i>istumka</i>] of the rumen.</b>
<b>Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says: <b>There is a narrow place in the rumen,</b> and this is the internal rumen; all the rest is the external rumen. <b>But I do not know which</b> area <b>is</b> this narrow place. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The rumen has fallen in a pit,</b> i.e., since it is unknown which area is considered the narrow place, a perforation in any part of the rumen renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Ava says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says:</b> The inner rumen extends <b>from the narrow place,</b> where the rumen begins to narrow as it approaches the gullet, <b>and downward</b> toward the gullet when the animal is suspended by its legs.
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Naḥmani says</b> in the name of <b>Shmuel:</b> The internal rumen is the <b>place</b> in the rumen <b>that has no wool,</b> i.e., downy projections on the inside of the rumen. <b>Rabbi Avina says</b> in the name of <b>Geneiva,</b> who said <b>in the name of Rav:</b> The <b>handbreadth in the gullet adjacent to the rumen, this is the internal rumen.</b>
<b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they said in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina: The entire rumen is the internal rumen. And</b> if so, <b>which is the external rumen?</b> It is the <b>flesh that envelops the majority of the rumen</b> on the underside of the animal. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says:</b> The internal rumen is the <b><i>mafrata</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the <i>mafrata</i>? Rav Avya said:</b> It is <b>the place that the butcher exposes</b> when he opens up the animal, i.e., the underside of the stomach.
The Gemara recounts: <b>In Neharde’a, they practiced in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna. Rav Ashi said to Ameimar,</b> one of the Sages of Neharde’a: <b>What</b> about <b>all these</b> other <b>statements,</b> that the internal rumen is another part of the rumen? Ameimar <b>said to him: They are all included in</b> the definition <b>of</b> the rumen according to <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna.</b> The cecum, the opening of the stomach, and the place with no wool all face the underside of the stomach, i.e., the <i>mafrata</i>.
Rav Ashi replied: <b>And what</b> about the opinion <b>that Rav Asi says</b> in the name of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> that the internal rumen is an unknown narrow area? Shouldn’t the entire rumen be treated as the internal rumen? Ameimar <b>said to him: Rav Aḥa bar Ava already explained</b> that <b>it</b> is the area extending from the narrow place until the gullet. This area is also included in the <i>mafrata</i>. Rav Ashi asked further: <b>And what</b> of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Avina,</b> that the internal rumen is the handbreadth near the gullet, <b>and of the residents of the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, that it is the entire rumen? Ameimar <b>said to him: These</b> opinions <b>certainly disagree</b> with that of Rabba bar Rav Huna, but we do not follow them.
§ The mishna states: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to a tear in the external rumen, for <b>a large</b> animal, a tear of one handbreadth renders it a <i>tereifa</i>, while for a small animal, it is a <i>tereifa</i> only if most of it was torn. <b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The word: <b>Large,</b> is <b>not</b> referring <b>literally</b> to <b>a large</b> animal, and the word: <b>Small,</b> is <b>not</b> referring <b>literally</b> to <b>a small</b> animal. <b>Rather,</b> concerning <b>any</b> animal large enough that <b>its</b> external rumen can be <b>torn one handbreadth and</b> this <b>does not constitute most</b> of it, <b>this is what we learned:</b> For <b>a large</b> animal, a tear of <b>one handbreadth</b> renders it a <i>tereifa</i>. And concerning any animal small enough that <b>most</b> of its external rumen can be torn <b>and</b> this does <b>not constitute one handbreadth, this is what we learned: For a small</b> animal, it is a <i>tereifa</i> only if <b>most</b> of it was torn. In other words, any external rumen torn either one handbreadth or in its majority renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara asks: If <b>most</b> of the external rumen is torn <b>but</b> it does <b>not constitute a handbreadth,</b> isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the animal is rendered a <i>tereifa</i>? There is a principle that the majority of an entity is considered like all of it. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this for a case <b>where</b> the tear would <b>constitute a handbreadth with any amount</b> more than a majority, i.e., the external rumen is slightly smaller than two handbreadths. <b>Lest you say</b> that in such a case, the animal <b>is not a <i>tereifa</i> until a handbreadth of it is torn,</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so. Rather, if the majority of the rumen is torn, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, even if this constitutes less than a handbreadth.
<b>Geneiva says</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi says:</b> If a round hole was <b>bored</b> through the external rumen <b>as</b> large as <b>a <i>sela</i></b> coin, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, since if</b> a hole of such size <b>will be stretched, it will reach the</b> length of a <b>handbreadth. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said:</b> This matter <b>was explained to me</b> personally <b>by Geneiva</b> himself, when we were <b>on the ferry of Neharde’a:</b> If the hole is exactly as large <b>as a <i>sela</i>,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b> If the size of the hole is <b>greater than a <i>sela</i>,</b> it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is considered <b>greater than a <i>sela</i>? Rav Yosef said: For example,</b> if <b>three</b> date <b>pits covered</b> in remains of the date can fit through the hole <b>with difficulty,</b> or if, <b>without</b> being <b>covered</b> in any remains, they can fit <b>comfortably,</b> this is considered a hole larger than a <i>sela</i>.
§ The mishna states: An animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if the <b>omasum or the reticulum</b> was perforated to the outside, i.e., to the abdominal cavity. With regard to this, <b>the Sages taught:</b> In the case of <b>a needle that is found in the thickness of the reticulum,</b> if it pierced the wall <b>from</b> only <b>one side,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b> If it pierced the wall <b>from both sides,</b> i.e., the needle completely pierced the wall of the stomach, it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> But even if it protrudes from both sides, it is not always a <i>tereifa</i>, and it may be inspected further: If <b>a drop of</b> congealed <b>blood is found on top of</b> the needle,

Daf 51a

<b>it is certain that</b> the perforation was created <b>before</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of the animal, and it is therefore a <i>tereifa</i>. If <b>a drop of blood is not found on it, it is certain that it</b> occurred <b>after</b> the <b>slaughter,</b> when the blood of the animal had stopped flowing. The animal is therefore kosher.
If <b>a scab covered the opening of the wound,</b> i.e., the perforation, <b>it is certain that</b> the perforation occurred <b>three days before</b> the <b>slaughter.</b> Consequently, if the animal was sold less than three days before the slaughter, the buyer can claim that the transaction was performed in error, as he did not intend to purchase a <i>tereifa</i> animal, and the seller must refund the buyer. If <b>a scab did not cover the opening of the wound,</b> and it is uncertain whether the perforation occurred before or after the animal was purchased, <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b> Accordingly, the buyer must furnish proof that the perforation occurred before the purchase in order to demand a refund.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from all other perforations, where even though there is no blood</b> on the wound the <b>Master deems</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> in all other cases, <b>there is nothing to</b> which the blood can <b>attach.</b> Even if the wound had bled, the blood would be reabsorbed into the flesh. <b>Here, since there is a needle,</b> it follows that <b>if it is</b> the case that the perforation occurred <b>before slaughter,</b> blood from the wound <b>would have attached</b> to the needle. Accordingly, if there is no blood on the needle, it is certain that the perforation occurred after slaughter.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Safra said to Abaye:</b> Did <b>the Master see a Torah scholar who came from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>and said: My name is Rav Avira? He said</b> that there was <b>an incident that came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi involving <b>a needle that was found in the thickness of the reticulum</b> protruding <b>from</b> only <b>one side, and he deemed</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Abaye <b>sent</b> a message <b>to</b> Rav Avira calling for him to come and explain the matter, since this contradicts the <i>baraita</i> that states that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> only if the needle protrudes from both sides. Rav Avira <b>did not come before him,</b> so Abaye <b>went before</b> Rav Avira. Rav Avira <b>was standing on the roof.</b> Abaye <b>said to him: Let Master descend and come,</b> but Rav Avira <b>did not descend.</b> Abaye <b>ascended to him</b> and <b>said to him: Say to me, what were the circumstances of the incident itself?</b>
Rav Avira <b>said to him: I am a director of assemblies</b> in the study hall. I was standing <b>above the Great Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Rav Huna of Tzippori and Rabbi Yosei of Medea were sitting before him, and a needle came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>that was found in the thickness of the reticulum</b> protruding <b>from one side,</b> i.e., the inside, <b>and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>turned</b> the reticulum <b>over and found a drop of blood on</b> the outside, parallel to the wound on the inside, <b>and he deemed</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And he said: If there is no wound</b> on the outside <b>there</b> as well, <b>from where</b> is this <b>drop of blood?</b> Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Avira: <b>He caused that man trouble</b> needlessly, i.e., you troubled me for no reason. <b>This is</b> nothing more than <b>the mishna,</b> which states that an animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if the <b>omasum or the reticulum was perforated to the outside.</b>
§ The mishna states: An animal that <b>fell from the roof</b> is a <i>tereifa</i>, since its limbs may have been shattered. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If one <b>left an animal above,</b> on the roof, <b>and he came</b> back <b>and found it below,</b> but did not see it fall, <b>one</b> need <b>not be concerned with regard to the shattering of limbs.</b> One may presume that it jumped intentionally and was not injured.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain kid belonging to Ravina that saw barley groats through</b> an open <b>skylight. It jumped</b> down through the skylight and <b>fell from the roof to the ground.</b> The case <b>came before Rav Ashi,</b> and Ravina <b>said to him:</b> What is the rationale for <b>this</b> statement <b>that Rav Huna says,</b> that if one <b>left an animal above and he came</b> back <b>and found it below, one</b> need <b>not be concerned about the</b> possible <b>shattering of limbs?</b> Is it <b>because</b> the animal usually <b>has something to grab hold of?</b> If so, since <b>this</b> kid jumped through a skylight, it <b>did not have something to grab hold of,</b> and one must be concerned. <b>Or perhaps</b> it is <b>because</b> the animal <b>evaluates itself</b> and determines that it can jump without injury. If so, <b>this</b> kid <b>also evaluated itself</b> before jumping, and one need not be concerned.
Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>because</b> the animal <b>evaluates itself</b> before jumping, <b>and this</b> kid <b>also evaluated itself</b> before jumping. Therefore, one need not be concerned about the possible shattering of limbs.
The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain ewe that was</b> in <b>the house of Rav Ḥaviva, whose hind legs would drag. Rav Yeimar said: This</b> ewe <b>suffers from rheumatism</b> [<b><i>shigrona</i></b>], and this is why she drags her legs. <b>Ravina objects to this: But perhaps the spinal cord was cut,</b> and this is why the ewe dragged her legs, and the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>They inspected her and found</b> that the spinal cord was cut, <b>as Ravina</b> said. The Gemara notes: <b>And even so, the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yeimar,</b> since <b>rheumatism is common,</b> but a cut <b>spinal cord is not common.</b> Accordingly, one need not be concerned about the possibility of a cut spinal cord.
<b>Rav Huna</b> also <b>says:</b> With regard to <b>rams that butt one another, one</b> need <b>not be concerned with regard to shattering of limbs. Even though they are in pain and stand</b> still, it is <b>only a fever that afflicts them;</b> one need not be concerned about the possibility of severe injuries. But <b>if they fall to the ground</b> due to the impact, <b>we certainly must be concerned</b> that their limbs may have been shattered.
<b>Rav Menashei says:</b> With regard to <b>these rams that thieves steal</b> and throw over the fence, <b>one</b> need <b>not be concerned with regard to the shattering of limbs. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>When</b> the thieves <b>throw them</b> over the fence, <b>they throw them</b> so that they land <b>on their hips,</b> where they will not be injured, <b>so that they will</b> be able to <b>run before them.</b> But if the thieves <b>returned them</b> to the owner, <b>we certainly must be concerned</b> that their limbs may have been shattered, since thieves do not throw them carefully when returning them. <b>And this statement</b> applies only <b>when they return them due to fear</b> of being caught, or are otherwise forced to return them. <b>But</b> if they return them <b>due to repentance, they have performed full-fledged repentance</b> and will take care to return them without injury.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>one hit</b> an animal <b>on its head</b> with a stick, <b>and</b> the length of the stick <b>continued toward its back;</b> or if one hit the animal <b>on its tail and</b> the length of the stick <b>continued toward its head,</b> such that in either case the blow extended <b>along the entire spine, one</b> need <b>not be concerned with regard to the shattering of limbs. But if the</b> length of the <b>stick concluded at the middle of the back, we</b> must be <b>concerned</b> that the strike caused an injury to the spine. <b>And if there are knots,</b> i.e., protrusions, <b>on</b> the stick, <b>we</b> must be <b>concerned</b> that it injured the spine, even if the stick fell across the entire back. <b>And if he struck it like a slash</b> across the width of the back, <b>we</b> must <b>be concerned</b> that it injured the spine.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says: The womb is not subject to</b> concern about possible <b>shattered limbs.</b> In other words, one need not be concerned that the limbs of a newborn calf may have been shattered by the narrow birth canal. <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman:</b> That which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports your</b> opinion: <b>A one-day-old infant</b>

Daf 51b

<b>becomes</b> ritually <b>impure</b> if he experiences a gonorrhea-like <b>discharge [<i>ziva</i>]. And if it should enter your mind</b> that a newborn <b>is subject to</b> concern about possible <b>shattered limbs, read here</b> the ruling stated with regard to <i>ziva</i>, that one’s discharge renders one impure only when it issues <b>“out of his flesh”</b> (Leviticus 15:2), <b>but not</b> when it issues <b>due to circumstances beyond his control,</b> e.g., due to illness. Therefore, if one must be concerned that a newborn’s limbs may have shattered during birth, his discharge would not render him impure.
The Gemara responds: One cannot bring a proof from this <i>baraita</i>, since <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the infant <b>left</b> the womb <b>by caesarean section</b> and did not exit through the narrow birth canal. By contrast, after normal births, a newborn’s discharge does not render it impure, since one is concerned about the possibility of shattered limbs.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a calf was born on a Festival, one may slaughter it</b> and eat it <b>on</b> the <b>Festival.</b> One need not wait twenty-four hours before deeming the animal kosher, as one does for an animal that fell from a roof. Apparently, one need not be concerned that its limbs were shattered during the birth. The Gemara responds: <b>Here, too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the calf <b>left</b> the womb <b>by caesarean section.</b> But after normal births, one must wait twenty-four hours before slaughtering the calf.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> all <b>agree that if</b> a firstborn animal <b>was born</b> on a Festival <b>and its blemish</b> was born <b>with it,</b> i.e., if it was born with a blemish that removes its sanctity and renders it permitted for consumption, <b>it is</b> considered to be <b>prepared</b> for the Festival and may be eaten. Evidently, one need not wait twenty-four hours before deeming it kosher. <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>here too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> deals with a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>left</b> the womb <b>by caesarean section,</b> one might respond: <b>Is</b> a firstborn animal born <b>by caesarean section sanctified? But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Rabbi Shimon would concede with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, e.g., a firstborn, <b>that</b> an animal born by caesarean section <b>is not sanctified?</b> Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> must be referring to an animal born naturally.
The Gemara responds: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a firstborn <b>that spread out</b> its legs <b>on the ground</b> and stood up immediately after birth. In such a case the animal is certainly not a <i>tereifa</i> on account of shattered limbs.
§ <b>And Rav Naḥman says:</b> If an animal was thrown to the ground in <b>the slaughterhouse</b> in preparation for slaughter, it <b>is not subject to</b> concern for <b>shattered limbs.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>A certain bull fell</b> in the slaughterhouse, <b>and its bellowing was audible</b> due to the blow. Still, <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta entered</b> and <b>took from the very best</b> portions of the bull and was not concerned that it may have been a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>The Sages said to him: From where</b> did you learn <b>this?</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta <b>said to them: This is what Rav said:</b> When falling, the bull <b>digs in its hooves until it reaches the earth.</b> Therefore, one need not be concerned that it fell roughly.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If an animal fell and <b>stood</b> up again, <b>it does not require</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> mentioned in the mishna (56b) to determine if it may be slaughtered. Nevertheless, <b>it certainly requires inspection</b> after slaughter to determine whether it was injured by the fall and rendered a <i>tereifa</i>. But if it both stood up and <b>walked</b> after the fall, <b>it does not</b> even <b>require inspection</b> after slaughter. <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi says: Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, i.e., even if it walked after the fall, <b>it requires inspection.</b>
<b>Rav Yirmeya bar Aḥa says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If the animal <b>stretched out its foreleg to stand, even if it did not</b> actually <b>stand,</b> it is considered to have stood and does not require a twenty-four-hour waiting period. If <b>it raised its leg to walk, even if it did not</b> actually <b>walk,</b> it is considered to have walked and does not require inspection according to Rav. <b>And Rav Ḥisda says:</b> Even if it did not stretch out its foreleg, but simply <b>struggled to stand, even if it did not stand,</b> it is considered to have stood and may be slaughtered that day.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: In any case <b>where</b> an animal <b>fell from the roof unawares,</b> i.e., unintentionally, <b>and stood but did not walk,</b> it <b>requires inspection</b> after slaughter <b>but does not require</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period</b> before slaughter. <b>And if it walked, it does not even require an inspection.</b>
§ <b>Ameimar said in the name of Rav Dimi of Neharde’a: A fallen</b> animal <b>that</b> the Sages <b>said requires inspection</b> must be inspected <b>around the intestines</b> to see whether the organs there have been perforated or torn, rendering the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Mar Zutra said to him: This</b> is what <b>we say in the name of Rav Pappa:</b> Such an animal <b>requires inspection around the entire</b> space of the body <b>cavity,</b> in case the ribs or spine have been damaged.
<b>Huna Mar, grandson of Rav Neḥemya, said to Rav Ashi: What</b> about the <b>two organs that must be severed in ritual slaughter [<i>simanim</i>],</b> i.e., the windpipe and the gullet? Do they require inspection as well? Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> The <b><i>simanim</i> are hard</b> and resistant to damage <b>in falling.</b> Therefore, one need not inspect them.
§ With regard to birds that have fallen, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: If a bird</b> fell and <b>hit the surface of the water, once it swims the full length of its</b> body, this <b>is sufficient</b> to indicate that its limbs have not been shattered, similar to an animal that walks after falling. <b>And we said</b> this <b>only</b> in cases where it swam <b>from below to above,</b> i.e., upstream. <b>But</b> if it swam <b>from above to below,</b> i.e., downstream, <b>it is</b> only <b>the water that carried it down,</b> and it must be inspected. <b>And if the water is standing,</b> e.g., in a pond, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> as it is clear that the bird is swimming on its own strength, and it need not be inspected. <b>And</b> even if the bird swims downstream, <b>if straw was scattered</b> in front of it <b>and</b> the bird <b>overtook it</b> with its swimming, <b>then</b> the bird <b>overtook it</b> on its own strength and need not be inspected.
If the bird fell on <b>a garment</b> spread out <b>taut</b> over poles, <b>we must be concerned</b> that its limbs may have been shattered from the impact. If it fell on a garment <b>that was not taut, we</b> need <b>not be concerned.</b> In any event, if the garment was <b>folded, we</b> need <b>not be concerned,</b> since it presumably was not taut enough to injure the bird. If the bird fell on <b>a net whose knots were</b> woven <b>closely</b> together, <b>we must be concerned</b> that its limbs may have been shattered from the impact. If the <b>knots were not close</b> together, <b>we</b> need <b>not be concerned.</b>
If the bird fell directly on to <b>flax arranged into bundles, we must be concerned</b> that its limbs may have been shattered from the impact, because the bundles are hard. If it fell on <b>this side or that side</b> of the bundles, <b>we</b> need <b>not be concerned,</b> because it did not fall directly onto the bundles and the impact was dampened. If it fell on <b>bundles of reeds, we must be concerned.</b> If it fell on <b>beaten and combed flax,</b> with the impurities removed, <b>we</b> need <b>not be concerned,</b> since it is soft. If it fell on flax that was <b>beaten but not combed, we must be concerned</b> due to the residue of flax stalks in the bundles. If it fell on flax <b>that was bundled</b> after it was beaten and combed, <b>since it has knots</b> in it <b>we must be concerned.</b> If the bird fell on flax <b>tow,</b> a coarse bundle of unspun fiber, <b>we must be concerned.</b> If it fell on <b>fine tow, we</b> need <b>not be concerned,</b> because it is soft.
If the bird fell on <b><i>nevara</i>,</b> the fibers that grow around a palm tree, <b>we must be concerned</b> that its limbs may have been shattered. If it fell on <b><i>timaḥta</i>,</b> palm bark cut into strips, <b>we</b> need <b>not be concerned.</b> If it fell on <b>sifted ashes, we must be concerned,</b> because the ashes harden. If it fell on <b>unsifted</b> ashes, <b>we</b> need <b>not be concerned,</b> because they are soft and scatter on impact.

Daf 52a

If the bird fell on <b>fine sand, we</b> need <b>not be concerned,</b> because the sand slides on impact, cushioning the fall. If it fell on <b>coarse sand, we must be concerned,</b> because there are large stones mixed into it. If it fell on <b>dust of the road, we must be concerned,</b> because the dust is compact and hard. If the bird fell on <b>bundled straw, we must be concerned,</b> because it is compact and hard. If the straw <b>was not bundled, we</b> need <b>not be concerned.</b>
If the bird fell on <b>wheat and all</b> similar <b>types of</b> grain, such as spelt or rye, whose kernels are hard, <b>we must be concerned.</b> If it fell on <b>barley and all</b> similar <b>types of</b> grain, such as oats, <b>we must be concerned.</b> With regard to <b>all types of beans, there is no</b> concern <b>due to</b> possible <b>shattered limbs</b> if a bird fell <b>on them,</b> since their round shape causes the bird to slide when it hits them, <b>except for fenugreek.</b> With regard to <b>peas, there is no</b> concern <b>due to</b> possible <b>shattered limbs,</b> but <b>with regard to chickpeas, there is</b> a concern <b>due to</b> possible <b>shattered limbs. The principle of the matter</b> is: <b>With regard to anything that slips</b> to the sides on impact, <b>there is no</b> concern <b>due to</b> possible <b>shattered limbs.</b> And with regard to anything that <b>does not slip, there is</b> a concern <b>due to</b> possible <b>shattered limbs.</b>
If the bird’s wings became stuck to <b>a <i>davuk</i>,</b> a board covered with glue set as a trap, and in trying to escape it fell to the ground while stuck to the board, <b>Rav Ashi deemed</b> the bird <b>permitted,</b> while <b>Ameimar deemed</b> it <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>In</b> a case where only <b>one wing</b> was stuck to the board, <b>everyone agrees that it is permitted,</b> because the bird flaps with the other wing, lessening the impact of the fall. <b>They disagree when both wings</b> are stuck to the board. The one <b>who deemed</b> it <b>prohibited</b> could have <b>said to you: How will it stand</b> itself up so that it might dampen the impact? <b>And</b> the one <b>who deemed</b> it <b>permitted</b> could have <b>said to you: It is possible for</b> it to <b>stand</b> itself up <b>by</b> using <b>the tips of</b> its <b>wings.</b>
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say: In</b> a case where <b>two wings</b> were stuck to the board, <b>everyone agrees that it is prohibited,</b> because it cannot dampen the impact. <b>They disagree when</b> only <b>one wing</b> is stuck to the board. <b>The one who deemed</b> it <b>permitted</b> could have <b>said to you: It is possible for</b> it to <b>fly with one wing</b> and dampen the fall. <b>And the one who deemed</b> it <b>prohibited</b> could say: <b>Since it cannot fly with this</b> wing that is stuck to the <i>davuk</i>, <b>it also cannot fly with that</b> untrapped wing. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: <b>In</b> a case where <b>two wings</b> were stuck, it is <b>prohibited. In</b> a case where only <b>one wing</b> was stuck, it is <b>permitted.</b>
§ The mishna states that if <b>most of</b> an animal’s <b>ribs were fractured,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>The Sages taught: These are most of the ribs: Six from here and six from there,</b> i.e., six on each side, <b>or eleven from here and one from there.</b> Twenty-two ribs are significant for matters of <i>tereifot</i>, eleven on each side. Twelve fractured ribs constitutes a majority.
<b>Ze’eiri says: And</b> this applies only when the ribs were fractured <b>from the half of</b> the rib <b>toward the spine,</b> but not if they were fractured on the other half. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And</b> this applies only to fractures occurring <b>in large ribs that contain marrow;</b> fractures in small ribs do not render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
§ <b>Ulla said</b> that <b>ben Zakkai says:</b> If the ribs were <b>dislocated</b> from the spine, even <b>a majority of one side,</b> i.e., six dislocated ribs, is enough to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. Only if the ribs were <b>broken</b> is <b>a majority of both sides</b> necessary. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Whether they were dislocated or broken,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> only <b>with a majority of both sides.</b>
<b>Rav says:</b> If <b>a rib was dislocated and</b> the attached <b>vertebra</b> was torn out <b>with it,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> even if the spinal cord remains intact. <b>Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav:</b> If <b>a rib was dislocated from here and</b> another <b>rib from there,</b> i.e., both ribs connected to a single vertebra were dislocated, <b>but</b> the <b>vertebra</b> itself remains <b>intact, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav <b>said to them: Are you saying</b> that an animal that was <b>sliced</b> in half is a <i>tereifa</i>? This animal is considered to have been sliced and already has the status of a carcass, as it is already considered dead (see 21a).
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav also say</b> that <b>a sliced</b> animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, since he said that if a rib was dislocated along with the attached vertebra, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>? In such a case, the opposite rib is inevitably detached. If so, the animal should be considered a carcass. The Gemara responds: <b>When Rav said</b> that such an animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, he was referring to a case where the <b>rib</b> was dislocated <b>without the vertebra.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t</b> Rav explicitly <b>say</b> his statement with regard to <b>a rib and vertebra</b> that were dislocated? The Gemara responds: Rav meant that if <b>a rib and half</b> its attached <b>vertebra</b> were dislocated, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. The opposite rib, however, is intact and connected to the remainder of the vertebra.
The Gemara challenges: <b>By inference,</b> one may conclude <b>that Rav Kahana and Rav Asi stated</b> their question with regard to a less serious case, i.e., where <b>a rib</b> from each side was torn out <b>without</b> the <b>vertebra</b> being damaged at all. <b>And</b> yet, Rav <b>said to them: Are you saying</b> that an animal that was <b>sliced</b> in half is a <i>tereifa</i>? Rather, this animal is a carcass and is certainly prohibited. <b>And</b> how could Rav say this? <b>But didn’t Ulla say</b> that <b>ben Zakkai says:</b> If the ribs were <b>dislocated,</b> even <b>a majority of one side</b> is enough to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, while if the ribs were <b>broken, a majority of both sides</b> is necessary? If so, any animal with fewer than six dislocated ribs should be kosher, as long as the spine is undamaged.
The Gemara responds: Rav could have <b>said to you: There,</b> where ben Zakkai says that six dislocated ribs on one side render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, this is referring only to ribs <b>not</b> dislocated <b>one opposite the other. Here,</b> where Rav says that two dislocated ribs render the animal a carcass, this is referring to ribs dislocated <b>one opposite the other.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> only if <b>a majority of both sides</b> was dislocated, <b>and in a majority of both sides, it is impossible that one of them is not situated opposite another?</b> Still, Rabbi Yoḥanan says that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> and not a carcass.
The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring to a case where <b>the pestle,</b> i.e., the end of the rib, was torn out <b>without the mortar,</b> the socket of the vertebra in which it sits, leaving the spine completely intact. In such a case, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> only if twelve ribs were dislocated, even though this necessarily includes one rib opposite another. <b>Here,</b> where Rav says that two dislocated ribs opposite one another render the animal a carcass, that is referring to a case where the <b>pestle and mortar</b> were torn out together, damaging the spine.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why did Rav Kahana and Rav Asi ask anything of Rav? Their case in question <b>is</b> identical to the statement of <b>Rav.</b> If Rav says that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if a rib and part of its vertebra were dislocated, that should be the <i>halakha</i> all the more so if ribs opposite one another were dislocated in addition to part of the attached vertebra. The Gemara responds: Rav Kahana and Rav Asi <b>did not hear</b> that statement <b>of Rav.</b>
The Gemara persists: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let them ask</b> about the simpler case of one dislocated rib, <b>like that</b> which <b>Rav</b> himself discussed. Why ask specifically about two ribs opposite one another? The Gemara responds: <b>They reasoned: Let us ask him one</b> question through <b>which he</b> will <b>explain to us two</b> different cases. <b>As, if we ask him</b> about only <b>one</b> dislocated rib, <b>this works out well if he says to us</b> that the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> because we can infer that <b>all the more so</b> if <b>two</b> ribs opposite one another are dislocated, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. But <b>if he says to us</b> that it is <b>kosher, we</b> must <b>still ask</b> with regard to a case of <b>two</b> dislocated ribs.
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>now, too, when they ask him</b> about <b>two</b> ribs, they may not receive an answer with regard to both cases. Granted, <b>this works out well if he says to them</b> that an animal with two dislocated ribs opposite one another is <b>kosher,</b> since they can infer that <b>all the more so</b> it is kosher if only <b>one</b> rib is dislocated. <b>But if he says to them</b> that it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, they</b> must <b>still ask</b> with regard to a case of only <b>one</b> dislocated rib.
The Gemara responds: <b>They reasoned</b> that it is better to ask about a case where two ribs opposite one another were dislocated, because <b>if</b> it is <b>so</b> that Rav holds that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if even one rib is dislocated, then <b>he would become angry</b> and respond: If an animal with even <b>one</b> dislocated rib is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to ask about an animal with <b>two</b> dislocated ribs?
The Gemara objects: <b>But they did say</b> this question <b>to him and he did not become angry,</b> despite the fact that he holds that even one dislocated rib renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara responds: <b>When he said to them: Are you saying</b> that an animal that was <b>sliced</b> in half is a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>this is his anger.</b> Rav Kahana and Rav Asi understood from this response that an animal with two dislocated ribs opposite one another is a carcass, but an animal with one dislocated rib is a <i>tereifa</i>.
§ <b>Rabba bar Rav Sheila says</b> that <b>Rav Mattana says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>a rib was ripped from its root, or</b> if the <b>skull was crushed in its majority, or</b> if <b>the flesh that envelops the majority of the rumen</b> was damaged <b>in its majority,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: Did Shmuel really say that if <b>a rib was ripped from its root,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>? But raise a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 2:3):

Daf 52b

<b>How much</b> is considered <b>a deficiency in the spine</b> of a corpse so that it will not be considered a full corpse that would render one impure in a tent? <b>Beit Shammai say: Two</b> missing <b>vertebrae, and Beit Hillel say: One vertebra. And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: And</b> just as Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree with regard to ritual impurity, <b>so too</b> they disagree with regard <b>to a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> i.e., according to Beit Hillel an animal missing only one vertebra is a <i>tereifa</i>. Evidently, Shmuel holds that a missing vertebra renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, but a dislocated rib does not.
The Gemara responds: This is not difficult. <b>Here,</b> where Shmuel says that a rib ripped from its root renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, he is referring to a case where the <b>rib</b> was torn out <b>without the vertebra. There,</b> where he says that a missing vertebra renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> according to Beit Hillel, he is referring to a case where the <b>vertebra</b> was missing <b>without</b> the <b>rib</b> being dislocated. But if the rib itself was ripped from its root, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to a case where <b>a rib</b> was dislocated <b>without the vertebra, you find this</b> commonly. <b>But how can you find</b> a case of a missing <b>vertebra without</b> a dislocated <b>rib?</b> The Gemara responds: This can occur <b>at the ends of the flanks,</b> where there are vertebrae with no ribs attached to them.
Shmuel said that just as Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel disagree with regard to ritual impurity, so too they disagree with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rav Oshaya objects to this</b> statement: <b>But</b> if that is so, then the opinion of Beit Hillel is the more stringent one, as they hold that even one missing vertebra renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. Accordingly, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> this dispute <b>along with</b> the list of <b>leniencies of Beit Shammai and stringencies of Beit Hillel</b> in tractate <i>Eduyyot</i>. <b>Rav said to him: When</b> the question <b>was asked, it was asked with regard to</b> the <b>ritual impurity</b> of a corpse. That is the source of the dispute between Beit Hillel and Beit Shammai, and on that matter, <b>Beit Shammai constitute</b> the <b>stringent</b> opinion. The parallel disagreement with regard to <i>tereifot</i> is not mentioned explicitly in any mishna or <i>baraita</i>, and it was therefore omitted from the list in tractate <i>Eduyyot</i>.
The Gemara returns to Shmuel’s statement: <b>Or</b> if the <b>skull was crushed in its majority,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> Is this referring to <b>the majority of its height or the majority of its circumference?</b> The Gemara responds: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
Shmuel also said: <b>Or</b> if <b>the flesh that envelops the majority of the rumen</b> was damaged <b>in its majority,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> Is this referring even to a case <b>where</b> the <b>majority</b> of the length of the flesh was <b>torn? Or</b> is it referring only to a case <b>where</b> the <b>majority</b> of the flesh was <b>removed,</b> but if it was torn along the majority of its length the animal remains kosher?
The Gemara responds: <b>Resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from that which we learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>the internal rumen was perforated or most of the external rumen was torn,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they said in the name of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina: The entire rumen is the internal rumen. And</b> if so, <b>which is the external rumen?</b> It is the <b>flesh that envelops the majority of the rumen.</b> Apparently, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> even if the flesh is torn in its majority.
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>This explanation is</b> meant <b>only to</b> clarify the statement of <b>Shmuel,</b> and Shmuel does not agree with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, as <b>this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The case of: Most of the external rumen was torn, mentioned in the mishna, where the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, is not referring to where the flesh enveloping the majority of the rumen was torn, but rather where the majority of the rumen itself was torn. The internal rumen is the <b>place</b> in the rumen <b>that has no wool,</b> i.e., downy projections on the inside of the rumen. Accordingly, one cannot prove anything about the statement of Shmuel based on an explanation of the mishna offered by Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina.
§ The mishna states: <b>And</b> an animal that was <b>clawed by a wolf</b>  is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: In</b> the case of <b>an animal,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i> if it was clawed by any predator <b>from the</b> size of a <b>wolf and upward. And with regard to birds,</b> they are <i>tereifot</i> if they were clawed by any predator <b>from the</b> size of <b>a hawk and upward.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What does</b> this statement of Rav, that an animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if it was clawed by a predator at least as large as a wolf, <b>serve to exclude? If we say</b> it serves <b>to exclude a cat</b> that clawed an animal, since it is smaller than a wolf, <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> in the mishna: <b>And</b> an animal <b>clawed by a wolf</b> is a <i>tereifa</i>. One can infer from this that cats do not render an animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And if you would say: This</b> mishna <b>teaches us that a wolf</b> can <b>also</b> effectively <b>claw a large</b> animal, e.g., cattle, but it may still be that a cat can render a small animal a <i>tereifa</i>, this cannot be; <b>didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If it was <b>clawed by a wolf in</b> the case of <b>a small</b> animal, <b>or clawed by a lion in</b> the case of <b>a large</b> animal, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>?
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda disagrees</b> with the Rabbis, and they hold that a wolf can also render large livestock <i>tereifa</i> by clawing, this too is impossible, as <b>doesn’t Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ela says:</b> The statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the mishna <b>comes only to explain the statement of the Rabbis?</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>Are you setting</b> the statement of one <b>man against</b> the statement of another <b>man?</b> Even if Rabbi Ela holds that Rabbi Yehuda comes only to explain the statement of the Rabbis, Rav may still hold that Rabbi Yehuda disagrees with the Rabbis. Or, <b>if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> everyone agrees that a wolf can render only a small animal a <i>tereifa</i> through clawing. Nevertheless, the statement of Rav serves <b>to exclude a cat</b> from the ability to render even a small animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Lest you say</b> that the mishna <b>taught</b> about a wolf only because this is <b>the manner</b> in which <b>the matter</b> typically occurs, but a cat may in fact render a small animal a <i>tereifa</i>, Rav <b>teaches us</b> that it is referring specifically to a wolf.
§ <b>Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> If an animal was <b>clawed by a cat or a mongoose, in</b> the case of <b>kids or lambs,</b> which are very small, it is a <i>tereifa</i>. If it was <b>clawed by a weasel in</b> the case of <b>birds,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: An animal <b>clawed by a cat, hawk, or mongoose</b> is not rendered a <i>tereifa</i> <b>until</b> one of its internal organs <b>is perforated to</b> its <b>recesses.</b> One may infer: <b>But they,</b> i.e., a cat, hawk, and mongoose, <b>do not have</b> the ability to render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> through the <b>clawing</b> itself.
The Gemara questions the inference: <b>And can you understand</b> that <b>a hawk does not</b> effectively <b>claw</b> an animal? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>And</b> a small bird <b>clawed by a hawk</b> is rendered a <i>tereifa</i>? The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where the mishna states that a hawk can effectively claw, it is <b>with regard to birds,</b> while <b>there,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> states that a hawk does not effectively claw, it is <b>with regard to kids and lambs.</b>
The Gemara returns to its initial objection: <b>In any case,</b> the <i>baraita</i> poses <b>a difficulty for Rav Ḥisda,</b> who says that a cat may render kids and lambs <i>tereifot</i> through clawing. The Gemara responds: Rav Ḥisda <b>states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Distinguished One says: They said</b> that a kid is <b>not</b> effectively <b>clawed</b> by a cat <b>only in a place where there are none</b> present to <b>save</b> it. <b>But in a place where there are</b> bystanders trying to <b>save</b> the kid, it <b>is</b> effectively <b>clawed,</b> since the cat is angered and injects venom into the wound. Rav Ḥisda is referring specifically to the latter case.
The Gemara asks: <b>And in a place where there are none</b> to <b>save</b> the kid, is it <b>not</b> effectively <b>clawed? But</b> there was <b>a certain hen that was</b> in <b>the house of Rav Kahana, which a cat pursued, and</b> the cat <b>entered</b> after it into <b>a small room, and the door shut in</b> the cat’s <b>face, and it struck the door with its paws</b> in anger. <b>And</b> afterward, <b>five drops of blood,</b> i.e., venom, <b>were found on</b> the door. Apparently a cat is venomous even if no one is present to save its prey.
The Gemara responds: For a cat, <b>saving itself is also considered like saving others.</b> Since the cat felt threatened, it acted as it would if there had been someone present to defend the hen. The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who state in the <i>baraita</i> that a cat can never effectively claw a small animal, even when there are bystanders attempting to save its prey, how do they explain this incident? The Gemara responds: According to the Rabbis, a cat does <b>have venom, but its venom does not burn</b> enough to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who state</b> the details of this exchange differently: After raising an objection to the statement of Rav Ḥisda from the <i>baraita</i> that states that a cat cannot effectively claw kids and lambs, the Gemara responds: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Distinguished One, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Distinguished One says: They said</b> that a kid <b>is</b> effectively <b>clawed</b> by a cat <b>only in a place where there are</b> bystanders present to <b>save</b> it. <b>But in a place where there are none</b> present to <b>save</b> the kid, it is <b>not</b> effectively <b>clawed.</b> The <i>baraita</i>, then, discusses a case where there are none present to save it. Rav Ḥisda agrees with the Rabbis that a cat can effectively claw an animal even when there are none present to save it.
The Gemara asks: <b>But in a place where there are none</b> present to <b>save</b> the kid, is it <b>not</b> effectively <b>clawed? But</b> there was <b>a certain hen that was</b> in <b>the house of Rav Kahana, which a cat pursued, and</b> the cat <b>entered</b> after it into <b>a small room, and the door shut in</b> the cat’s <b>face, and it struck the door with its paws</b> in anger. <b>And</b> afterward, <b>five drops of blood,</b> i.e., venom, <b>were found on</b> the door. The Gemara responds: For a cat, <b>saving itself is also considered like saving others.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Kahana asked Rav:</b>

Daf 53a

<b>Does a cat</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing, or does a cat not</b> render it a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing?</b> Rav <b>said to him: Even a weasel,</b> which is smaller than a cat, <b>does</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing.</b> Rav Kahana also asked him: <b>Does a weasel</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing, or does a weasel not</b> render it a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing?</b> Rav <b>said to him: Even a cat does not</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing.</b>
Rav Kahana also asked him: With regard <b>to a cat and a weasel, do they</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing, or do they not</b> render it a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing?</b> Rav <b>said to him: A cat does</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing,</b> but <b>a weasel does not</b> render it a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>And</b> the apparent contradiction between these responses is <b>not difficult. That which</b> Rav <b>said to him: Even a weasel does</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing,</b> was stated <b>about</b> a case of clawed <b>birds. That which he said to him: Even a cat does not</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing,</b> was stated <b>about</b> a case of <b>adult sheep. That which</b> Rav <b>said to him: A cat does</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing,</b> but <b>a weasel does not</b> render it a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing,</b> was stated <b>about</b> a case of <b>kids and lambs.</b>
§ The mishna states that a small bird clawed by a hawk is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>other non-kosher birds</b> beside a hawk, <b>do they</b> render a bird a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing, or do they not</b> render it a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing? Rav Hillel said to Rav Ashi: When we were in the study hall of Rav Kahana, he said: Other non-kosher birds do</b> render a bird a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>Or</b> if it was <b>clawed by a hawk in</b> the case of <b>a small bird,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i>? Apparently, only a hawk renders a small bird a <i>tereifa</i> through clawing. The Gemara responds: The mishna means that a small bird <b>clawed by a hawk</b> is rendered a <i>tereifa</i> even <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> it is as large <b>as</b> the hawk. <b>But these</b> other non-kosher birds can render a small bird a <i>tereifa</i> only <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> it is <b>smaller than them. And there are</b> those <b>who say:</b> A small bird <b>clawed by a hawk</b> is rendered a <i>tereifa</i> even <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> it is <b>larger than</b> the hawk. <b>But these</b> other non-kosher birds can render a small bird a <i>tereifa</i> only <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> it is, at most, as large <b>as them.</b>
§ <b>Rav Kahana said in the name of Rav Shimi bar Ashi: A fox does not</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said:</b> There was <b>an incident</b> in which <b>a fox clawed a ewe in the bathhouse of Beit Hini, and the incident came before the Sages, and they said:</b> This <b>is</b> a case of <b>clawing. Rav Safra said</b> in response: In <b>that</b> case the predator <b>was a cat,</b> not a fox.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> the above exchange differently: <b>Rav Kahana said in the name of Rav Shimi bar Ashi: A fox does</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said:</b> There was <b>an incident</b> in which <b>a fox clawed a ewe in the bathhouse of Beit Hini, and the incident came before the Sages, and they said:</b> This is <b>not</b> a case of <b>clawing. Rav Safra said</b> in response: In <b>that</b> case the predator <b>was a dog,</b> not a fox. And <b>Rav Yosef said: We have a tradition</b> that <b>a dog does not</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> through <b>clawing.</b>
§ With regard to the definition of clawing that renders an animal a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>Abaye said: We have a tradition: Clawing is only with the foreleg, to the exclusion of</b> clawing with the <b>hind leg, which does not</b> render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. Additionally, <b>clawing is only with the claw, to the exclusion of</b> savaging with the <b>tooth, which does not</b> render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, because the teeth contain no venom. And <b>clawing is only through an intentional</b> act, <b>to the exclusion of an unintentional</b> act, <b>which does not</b> render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, e.g., if the predator accidentally fell on the prey with its claws outstretched. And <b>clawing is only while</b> the predator is <b>alive, to the exclusion of</b> a case where it clawed an animal <b>after death, which does not</b> render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Sages <b>say: Now</b> that <b>you said</b> that <b>an unintentional</b> act of clawing does <b>not</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to say that clawing <b>after death</b> is ineffective? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> for a case <b>where</b> the predator <b>clawed</b> while still alive, <b>and they cut off its hand</b> with its claws still inside the prey’s flesh. <b>Lest you say: It injects its venom while it claws,</b> Abaye <b>teaches us</b> that <b>it injects its venom while it withdraws</b> its claws. Accordingly, where the venom has yet to be injected before its death, i.e., before its hand is severed, the animal is kosher.
§ <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>a lion entered among the oxen, and</b> afterward <b>a claw was found</b> stuck <b>in the back of one of</b> the oxen, <b>one</b> need <b>not be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the <b>lion clawed it. What is the reason</b> for this? Even though <b>a majority of lions claw</b> their prey <b>and</b> only <b>a minority of them do not claw,</b> still, it is known with regard to <b>any</b> lion <b>that claws</b> that <b>its claw is not ripped out</b> in the process. <b>And</b> therefore, with regard to <b>this</b> ox, <b>since a claw sits in its back, say</b> that <b>it rubbed against a wall</b> that had a claw embedded in it.
The Gemara objects: <b>On the contrary,</b> say that even though <b>a majority of oxen rub</b> against the wall <b>and</b> only <b>a minority do not rub,</b> still, it is known with regard to <b>any</b> ox <b>that rubs</b> that <b>a claw does not sit in its back. And</b> therefore, with regard to <b>this</b> ox, <b>since a claw sits in its back, say</b> that the <b>lion clawed it.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>One can say this, and one can say that.</b> Therefore, <b>establish the matter</b> according to <b>its presumptive status,</b> in which case the ox is not a <i>tereifa</i>. Accordingly, the ox is permitted because <b>this</b> case <b>is</b> one of <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether the animal was <b>clawed, and Rav</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says: One</b> need <b>not be concerned</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether an animal was <b>clawed.</b>
<b>Abaye said: We said</b> that one need not be concerned that the lion clawed the ox <b>only</b> when the <b>claw</b> was found in its back, since it is known that a claw is not ripped out during clawing. <b>But</b> if only <b>the spot of a claw</b> was found, i.e., a perforation, <b>one must be concerned. And even</b> if the <b>claw</b> was found in its back, <b>we said</b> that one need not be concerned <b>only</b> when it was <b>moist,</b> since this indicates it was well connected to the flesh. Accordingly, if the lion had clawed the ox, this claw would not have been ripped out. <b>But</b> if the claw was <b>dry,</b> one must be concerned, because <b>it happens that</b> such a claw <b>is ripped out</b> during clawing.
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>a moist</b> claw <b>as well, we said</b> that one need not be concerned <b>only</b> when <b>one</b> claw was found in its back. <b>But</b> if there were <b>two or three</b> claws embedded in its back, <b>we must be concerned,</b> because multiple claws were not likely to be embedded in the wall. <b>And this is</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>where they are situated in a row as</b> they are in the <b>paw of</b> a lion.
§ It <b>was stated: Rav says: One</b> need <b>not be concerned</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether an animal was <b>clawed. And Shmuel says: One must be concerned</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether an animal was <b>clawed,</b> and the animal must be inspected.
The Gemara explains: <b>Everyone</b> agrees that in a case where it is <b>uncertain</b> whether a predator <b>entered</b> the pen or coop and <b>uncertain</b> whether it <b>did not enter, I will say</b> that <b>it did not enter.</b> Furthermore, if it is known that an animal entered but it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it was <b>a dog</b> and <b>uncertain</b> whether it was <b>a cat, I will say</b> that it was <b>a dog,</b> which cannot render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> through clawing. And even if a predator <b>entered,</b> but it <b>was quiet and sat among</b> the animals, <b>I will say it made peace</b> with them, as though it were tame, and did not claw them. And if it <b>decapitated one of them,</b> I will say that its <b>anger subsided</b> afterward, and it did not claw other animals. And if <b>it was roaring and they were clucking,</b> I will say that <b>they are</b> only <b>frightening</b>

Daf 53b

<b>each other,</b> and one need not be concerned. <b>They disagree when</b> the lion <b>is quiet and</b> the birds <b>are clucking.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>holds:</b> They are clucking because <b>it is acting upon them,</b> i.e., clawing them, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that <b>they are doing this out of fear of</b> the predator, but it is not necessarily clawing them.
<b>Ameimar said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one must be concerned</b> in a case of <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether an animal was <b>clawed. Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: What</b> about <b>this</b> statement <b>of Rav</b> that one need not be concerned? Ameimar <b>said to him: I did not hear</b> that statement; <b>that is to say, I do not hold</b> in accordance with it.
<b>Or if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>Rav retracted</b> his statement and conceded <b>to Shmuel</b> that one must be concerned in a case of uncertainty. <b>As</b> there was <b>a certain basket of</b> birds concerning which there was <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether they had been <b>clawed</b> by a hawk that entered among them, <b>which came before Rav.</b> Rav <b>sent them before Shmuel</b> to issue a ruling, and Shmuel <b>strangled them and threw them in the river. And if it enters your mind that</b> Rav <b>did not retract</b> his statement, then <b>let him permit them</b> for consumption. Why did he send them to Shmuel?
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Rather, what</b> will you say, that Rav really did <b>retract?</b> If so, <b>let him prohibit them</b> for consumption without sending them to Shmuel. <b>Rather,</b> he sent the birds to Shmuel because <b>it was Shmuel’s place,</b> and although Rav disagreed with Shmuel, it would be improper to issue a contradictory ruling.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need Shmuel <b>to strangle</b> the birds? <b>Let him</b> simply <b>throw them into the river as is.</b> The Gemara responds: Shmuel was concerned lest <b>they fly and leave</b> the river and eventually end up in the possession of an unwitting Jew.
The Gemara objects: <b>But let him delay</b> killing <b>them</b> for <b>twelve months.</b> If they survive it will prove that they are not <i>tereifot</i>, and they will be permitted. The Gemara responds: Shmuel was concerned lest people <b>encounter a stumbling block,</b> as they might forget that these birds are prohibited and eat them before twelve months have passed. The Gemara asks: <b>But let him sell them to gentiles</b> so that they will not be a stumbling block. The Gemara responds: Shmuel was concerned that perhaps the gentiles <b>will come to sell them</b> back <b>to Jews.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But let him strangle them and throw them into the garbage.</b> Why did Shmuel throw them into the river? The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning, we should throw them to the dogs,</b> as at least then they will come to some use. <b>Rather,</b> Shmuel threw them into the river, a public place, in order <b>to publicize the matter of the prohibition.</b>
The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain duck that was in the house of Rav Ashi.</b> The duck <b>entered between the reeds,</b> and it <b>came out with its throat stained with blood. Rav Ashi said: Do we not say:</b> If it is <b>uncertain</b> whether the predator was <b>a dog</b> and <b>uncertain</b> whether it was <b>a cat, I will say</b> that it was <b>a dog,</b> which cannot claw an animal effectively? <b>Here, too,</b> since it is <b>uncertain</b> whether the duck was injured by <b>a reed</b> and <b>uncertain</b> whether it was injured by <b>a cat, I will say</b> that <b>a reed struck it,</b> and the duck is not a <i>tereifa</i>.
§ <b>The sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> Yehuda and Ḥizkiyya, <b>said: A clawed</b> animal, about <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said</b> one must be concerned, <b>requires inspection</b> of the flesh <b>adjacent to the intestines.</b> If the flesh surrounding the intestines reddened, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, because the venom will eventually penetrate the body cavity and perforate the intestines themselves.
<b>Rav Yosef said: This</b> statement <b>of the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> was <b>already explained</b> by <b>Shmuel, as Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus: A clawed animal,</b> about <b>which they said</b> one must be concerned, <b>requires inspection adjacent to the intestines.</b>
<b>Ilfa raises a dilemma: Is there clawing with regard to the <i>simanim</i>, or is there no clawing with regard to the <i>simanim</i>?</b> Does the venom penetrate the <i>simanim</i> as it does the intestines? <b>Rabbi Zeira said: This dilemma that Ilfa raises</b> was <b>already explained</b> by <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava, as Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says</b> that <b>Rav says: A clawed animal,</b> about <b>which they said</b> one must be concerned, <b>requires inspection</b> of the flesh <b>adjacent to the entire</b> body <b>cavity, and even in</b> the area of <b>the <i>simanim</i>.</b>
<b>Ilfa raises</b> another <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b><i>simanim</i> that were detached, how much</b> detachment renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>Rabbi Zeira said: This dilemma that Ilfa raises</b> was <b>already explained</b> by <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana, as Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b><i>simanim</i> that were detached,</b> if they were detached <b>in their majority</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Rav Ami raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an animal that was clawed in an area not surrounding the body cavity, such as the legs, and <b>rot</b> was found in the flesh of that area? <b>Rabbi Zeira said: This dilemma that Rav Ami raises</b> was <b>already explained</b> by <b>Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: With regard to a clawed</b> animal, the injury does not render it a <i>tereifa</i> <b>unless the flesh adjacent to the intestine reddens;</b> but if <b>the flesh rotted, one views</b> the rotten area <b>as if it does not exist.</b> If the animal would be a <i>tereifa</i> when missing this flesh, it is also a <i>tereifa</i> if the flesh rotted.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is considered rotten</b> flesh? <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> It is <b>any</b> flesh in such a state that <b>the doctor scrapes it off and leaves</b> the animal <b>with</b> its <b>raw flesh</b> exposed so that it will heal. <b>Rav Ashi said: When we were in the study hall of Rav Kahana they brought before us a certain lung that, when they would set it down, would sit well, but when they would pick it up it would disintegrate and fall into pieces. And we deemed it a <i>tereifa</i> based on</b> the statement <b>of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> that one views rotten flesh as if it does not exist. Since the animal would be a <i>tereifa</i> if missing the lung (see 42a), it is also a <i>tereifa</i> if the lung is rotten.
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> If an animal was pierced <b>by a thorn,</b> it is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>until it is perforated to the cavity</b> of the body. But <b>in</b> the case of <b>a clawed</b> animal, <b>once the flesh adjacent to</b> the <b>intestines reddens,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rav Zevid</b> would <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> in <b>this</b> manner: <b>In</b> the case of <b>a clawed</b> animal, <b>once the flesh adjacent to</b> the <b>intestines reddens</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i>; but if it was clawed <b>in the <i>simanim</i>,</b> it is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>unless the <i>simanim</i> themselves redden.</b> If only the flesh around them reddens, the animal is kosher, since the venom may not penetrate to the <i>simanim</i> themselves.
<b>Rav Pappi said: Rav Beivai bar Abaye raises a dilemma:</b>

Daf 54a

If the <b>gullet</b> is <b>perforated in any amount,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, as taught in the mishna (42a). Therefore, if the gullet is <b>clawed</b> and <b>any amount</b> of its flesh reddens, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> as well. But <b>a perforation</b> of the <b>windpipe</b> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> only <b>where</b> it is the size of <b>an <i>issar</i>.</b> If <b>clawed, what amount</b> of its flesh must redden in order to render it a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>After he raised the dilemma he then resolved it: Both this and that</b> render the animal a <i>tereifa</i> if <b>any amount</b> of its flesh reddened. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is because <b>its venom burns continuously</b> around the circumference of the hole and widens it.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta sat before Rav Naḥman, and he was sitting and saying: A clawed animal,</b> about <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said</b> one must be concerned, <b>requires inspection adjacent to the intestines</b> to see that the flesh has not reddened. <b>Rav Naḥman said to him: By God! Rav would teach</b> that <b>it</b> must be inspected over its entire body, <b>from</b> the flesh around <b>the hollow to</b> that of <b>the thigh.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the hollow? If we say</b> that it is <b>the hollow of the foreleg,</b> i.e., its shoulder, then the area between it and the thigh <b>is</b> the same as the area <b>adjacent to the intestines,</b> and Rav Naḥman has said nothing new. <b>Rather,</b> Rav Naḥman referred to the area <b>from the hollow of the brain,</b> i.e., the skull, <b>to the thigh.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef went up</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found that Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish were sitting and saying: A clawed animal,</b> about <b>which they said</b> one must be concerned, <b>requires inspection adjacent to the intestines.</b> Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef <b>said to them: By God! Rav would teach</b> that <b>it</b> must be inspected <b>from</b> the flesh around <b>the hollow to</b> that of <b>the thigh. Reish Lakish said to him: Who is</b> this <b>Rav, and who is</b> this <b>Rav? I do not know</b> who <b>he</b> is.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> to him: <b>But don’t</b> you <b>remember that student who served the great Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> and studied under them? <b>But by God! All those years that this student served in the yeshiva,</b> he was held to be one of the most important students and was allowed to sit during study, while <b>I</b> held a lower status and <b>served while standing up. And who was greater? He was greater in all</b> things, in Torah and piety.
<b>Immediately, Reish Lakish began</b> to speak <b>and said: Indeed [<i>beram</i>], that man,</b> Rav, <b>is remembered for the good, as they said this <i>halakha</i> in his name:</b> If an animal’s windpipe is <b>dislocated</b> from the throat, <b>and</b> it has already been <b>slaughtered,</b> and it is uncertain whether it was dislocated before or after slaughter, the animal is <b>kosher, as it is impossible for</b> an animal with <b>a dislocated windpipe to be slaughtered.</b> A dislocated windpipe would have slipped away from the knife, and therefore the animal must have been slaughtered while it was still attached.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This is not certain; rather, one <b>should bring</b> the windpipe, make a new slit in it, <b>and compare</b> the two slits. If they are similar, then the first slit by the slaughtering knife was also made after the windpipe was dislocated, and the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. If they are different, then the slaughter preceded the dislocation of the windpipe and the animal is kosher.
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that it is impossible to slaughter a dislocated windpipe <b>only</b> in cases <b>where he did not grip the <i>simanim</i></b> during slaughter. <b>But</b> if <b>he gripped the <i>simanim</i> and slaughtered</b> the animal, then it is <b>possible for</b> an animal with <b>a dislocated windpipe to be slaughtered,</b> since it will not slip away from the knife.
§ The mishna states: <b>This is the principle:</b> Any animal that was injured such that an animal in a similar condition could not live for an extended period is a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> case does this principle <b>add</b> that was not previously mentioned? The Gemara responds: It was stated <b>to add seven <i>halakhot</i></b> of <i>tereifot</i> taught by <i>amora’im</i> and not listed in the mishna. These cases are enumerated on 42b.
The Gemara recounts: The men <b>of the house of Yosef the hunter</b> would <b>strike the sciatic nerve</b> of an animal with an arrow <b>and kill</b> it that way. In other words, the animal would die from that wound. <b>They came before Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira</b> to ask if an animal with an injured sciatic nerve is a <i>tereifa</i>, which is relevant if the animal was slaughtered before it died. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>said to them: And is</b> it possible <b>to add to the</b> list of <b><i>tereifot</i>? You have only what the Sages counted,</b> and the Sages mentioned no such <i>tereifa</i>.
Likewise, the men of <b>Rav Pappa bar Abba the hunter</b> would <b>strike</b> an animal <b>in the kidney</b> with an arrow <b>and kill</b> it that way. <b>They came before Rabbi Abba</b> to ask if such an animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. Rabbi Abba <b>said to them: And is</b> it possible <b>to add to the</b> list of <b><i>tereifot</i>? You have only what the Sages counted.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But we see that they die.</b> Isn’t this an indication that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>? The Gemara responds: It <b>is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that</b> in all these cases, <b>if one</b> were to <b>scatter medicine</b> on the wound, the animal would <b>live.</b> An animal is not considered a <i>tereifa</i> unless it cannot be healed.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And these,</b> despite their condition, <b>are kosher in an animal:</b> If its <b>windpipe was perforated or cracked</b> lengthwise. <b>How much can</b> the windpipe <b>be missing</b> and still be kosher? <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Until</b> the perforation is the same size <b>as the Italian <i>issar</i>.</b> If <b>the skull was fractured but the membrane of the brain was not perforated,</b> it is kosher. If <b>the heart was perforated and</b> the perforation <b>did not</b> reach <b>its chamber,</b> or if <b>the spinal</b> column <b>was broken but its cord was not cut,</b> or if <b>the liver was removed and an olive-bulk of it remained,</b> it is kosher.
Additionally, it is kosher if the <b>omasum or the reticulum was perforated one into the other.</b> If <b>the spleen was removed,</b> or <b>the kidneys were removed,</b> or if <b>its lower jaw was removed,</b> or if <b>its womb was removed, or</b> if its lung <b>shriveled by the hand of Heaven,</b> the animal is kosher. In the case of an animal <b>whose hide was removed, Rabbi Meir deems it kosher, and the Rabbis deem it</b> a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna begins: And these are kosher, while the previous mishna begins: These are <i>tereifot</i>. With regard to this, it <b>was stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <i>tanna</i> intended the phrase: <b>These are <i>tereifot</i>, specifically,</b> teaching that an animal is kosher in another case. The list of kosher cases here is therefore not exhaustive. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says</b> that the <i>tanna</i> intended the phrase: <b>These are kosher, specifically,</b> teaching that an animal is a <i>tereifa</i> in another case. The list of <i>tereifot</i> at the beginning of the chapter is therefore not exhaustive.
The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what</b> case <b>do they disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the statement <b>of Rav Mattana, as Rav Mattana says: This head of the femur that was</b> completely <b>dislocated</b> renders the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> According to <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who <b>says</b> that the phrase: <b>These are <i>tereifot</i>,</b> is meant <b>specifically,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the list of <b><i>tereifot</i> and taught</b> afterward: <b>This is the principle,</b> to add cases that were not stated explicitly;

Daf 54b

<b>and</b> the <i>tanna</i> then <b>saw</b> that the case <b>of Rav Mattana,</b> where the end of the thigh is dislocated, ostensibly <b>comes</b> under the heading of: <b>This is the principle,</b> and one might assume that it renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i> as well. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>because</b> a dislocated thigh is <b>similar to</b> the cases of <b>removed</b> organs that render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. Therefore, <b>he taught</b> the phrase: <b>These are <i>tereifot</i>,</b> at the beginning of the mishna, to emphasize that <b>it is</b> only <b>these that</b> render an animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, but</b> in the case <b>of Rav Mattana,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b>
<b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> who <b>says</b> that the phrase: <b>These are kosher,</b> is meant <b>specifically,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> the list of <b><i>tereifot</i>, and taught</b> afterward that <b>this is the principle. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> then <b>saw</b> that the case <b>of Rav Mattana</b> ostensibly <b>does not come</b> under the heading of: <b>This is the principle,</b> and one might assume that it does not render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is because a dislocated thigh <b>is not similar to</b> cases of <b>perforated</b> organs, <b>and it is not similar to</b> cases of <b>cut</b> organs, such as the windpipe, <b>and</b> it <b>is not similar to</b> cases of <b>removed</b> organs. Therefore, <b>he taught</b> the phrase: <b>These are kosher,</b> to emphasize that <b>it is</b> only <b>these that are kosher, but</b> in the case <b>of Rav Mattana,</b> the animal <b>is a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
The Gemara addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Mattana says: This head of the femur that was</b> completely <b>dislocated</b> renders the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And Rava said:</b> The animal is <b>kosher, but if its sinew</b> holding the bone in place <b>is cut,</b> it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: Even if the sinew is <b>cut,</b> the animal is <b>still kosher, unless</b> the sinew <b>decomposed,</b> in which case the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>.
§ The mishna states: <b>How much can</b> the windpipe <b>be missing</b> and still be kosher? Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Until the perforation is the same size as an Italian <i>issar</i>. <b>Ze’eiri,</b> who came from Eretz Yisrael, <b>said</b> with regard to this: <b>You, who are not familiar with the measure</b> of an Italian <i>issar</i>, because it is not used in Babylonia, should estimate <b>its measure as a Kurdish dinar. And it is like a small <i>peruta</i></b> coin <b>and can be found among the <i>perutot</i> of Pumbedita.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥana the money changer said: Bar Nappaḥa,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>was standing over me, and he requested of me a Kurdish dinar with</b> which <b>to measure <i>tereifot</i>,</b> in accordance with the statement of Ze’eiri. <b>And I wanted to rise before him</b> out of respect, <b>but he did not let me.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to me: Sit, my son, sit. Tradesmen are not permitted to stand before Torah scholars when they are engaged in their work.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are tradesmen <b>not</b> permitted to stand before Torah scholars? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:3): When the pilgrims bring their first fruits to Jerusalem, <b>all the tradesmen stand before them, and greet them, and say to them: Our brothers from such and such place, welcome?</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Yes, <b>they stand before</b> those bringing first fruits, but <b>they do not stand before Torah scholars. Rabbi Yosei bar Avin says: Come and see how beloved is a mitzva</b> performed <b>in its</b> proper <b>time, as</b> the tradesmen <b>stand before those</b> who brought first fruits, while <b>they do not stand before Torah scholars.</b>
The Gemara rejects the statement of Rabbi Yosei bar Avin: <b>From where</b> does one know that they rise out of respect? <b>Perhaps</b> the tradesmen stand only <b>in order not to cause</b> those bringing first fruits to <b>fail</b> and sin <b>in the future.</b> That is, if the tradesmen do not treat those bringing the first fruits with great respect, they may not make the effort to travel to Jerusalem in a subsequent year.
§ The mishna states: How much can the windpipe be missing and still be kosher? Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Until the perforation is the same size as an Italian <i>issar</i>. With regard to this, <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> Whenever the Sages specify the measure <b>as</b> that of <b>a <i>sela</i>,</b> e.g., with regard to a damaged skull for purposes of <i>tereifot</i>, they mean that even an area exactly the size of a <i>sela</i> is treated <b>as more than a <i>sela</i>.</b> Likewise, when they specify the measure <b>as</b> that of <b>an <i>issar</i>,</b> they mean that an area exactly the size of an <i>issar</i> is treated <b>as</b> though it were <b>more than an <i>issar</i>.</b>
Since Rav Naḥman holds that a perforation exactly the size of an <i>issar</i> is treated as though it were larger than an <i>issar</i>, he must hold that such a perforation in the windpipe renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara therefore infers: <b>Apparently, Rav Naḥman holds</b> that whenever the Sages use the word: Until, it means <b>until and not including the measure,</b> as the mishna states that an animal with a perforated windpipe is kosher until the perforation reaches the size of an <i>issar</i>.
<b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 19:2): The end of <b>a rope that extends from</b> a rope <b>bed is not susceptible to ritual impurity until</b> it is <b>five handbreadths</b> long. If the bed becomes impure, the rope remains pure, because it has no use and is therefore not considered part of the bed. <b>What, is it not</b> teaching that a rope exactly <b>five</b> handbreadths long is treated <b>as</b> though its length were <b>below</b> that amount? If so, the word: Until, means until and including the exact measure. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> a rope exactly <b>five</b> handbreadths long is <b>like</b> a rope whose length is <b>above</b> that amount.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the continuation of the mishna: If the end of the rope was of any length <b>from five</b> handbreadths <b>until ten, it is susceptible to impurity. What, is it not</b> teaching that a rope exactly <b>ten</b> handbreadths long is treated <b>as</b> though its length were <b>below</b> that? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> a rope exactly <b>ten</b> handbreadths long is treated <b>like</b> a rope whose length is <b>above</b> that, and it is not susceptible to impurity.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from another mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 2:2): With regard to <b>the smallest of earthenware vessels,</b> if <b>they, or</b> even <b>their</b> broken-off <b>bases or sides,</b> can <b>sit,</b> i.e., remain upright, <b>without being supported,</b>

Daf 55a

<b>their measure</b> in order to be susceptible to ritual impurity is that they can hold <b>enough</b> oil with which <b>to anoint a small child.</b> If they cannot hold this amount, they are considered useless and are not susceptible to impurity. <b>And</b> this measure applies only to vessels that held <b>up to a <i>log</i></b> when they were whole; if they had originally held more, they must hold more when broken in order to be susceptible to impurity. <b>What, is it not</b> teaching that if it originally held exactly one <b><i>log</i></b> it is treated <b>as</b> though it had held <b>below</b> that amount? If so, the term: Up to, means up to and including. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> if it held exactly one <b><i>log</i></b> it is treated <b>as</b> though it held <b>above</b> that amount, and if broken it must be capable of holding a greater measure in order to be susceptible to impurity.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the continuation of the same mishna: If the vessel originally held <b>from a <i>log</i> up to a <i>se’a</i>,</b> its broken-off base or sides must hold <b>a quarter-<i>log</i></b> in order to be susceptible to impurity. <b>What, is it not</b> teaching that if it originally held exactly <b>a <i>se’a</i></b> it is treated <b>as</b> though it had held <b>below</b> that amount? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> if it held exactly <b>a <i>se’a</i></b> it is treated <b>as</b> though it had held <b>above</b> that amount, and its base or sides must hold a greater measure in order to be susceptible to impurity.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the continuation of the same mishna: If the vessel had originally held <b>from a <i>se’a</i>up to two <i>se’a</i>,</b> its broken-off base or sides must hold <b>half a <i>log</i></b> to be susceptible to impurity. <b>What, is it not</b> teaching that if it had originally held exactly <b>two <i>se’a</i></b> it is treated <b>as</b> if though it had held <b>below</b> that amount? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> if it had held exactly <b>two <i>se’a</i></b> it is treated <b>as</b> though it had held <b>above</b> that amount.
The Gemara asks: How can one explain the mishna in this manner? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: If the vessel had originally held exactly <b>a <i>log</i></b> it is treated <b>as</b> though it had held <b>below</b> that amount; if it had held exactly <b>a <i>se’a</i></b> it is treated <b>as</b> though it had held <b>below</b> that amount; if it had held exactly <b>two <i>se’a</i></b> it is treated <b>as</b> though it had held <b>below</b> that amount? Evidently, the term: Up to, means up to and including the given measure, in contradiction to Rav Naḥman’s opinion that it means up to and not including the measure.
The Gemara responds: The term: Up to, is always interpreted in the more stringent manner. Accordingly, <b>there,</b> with regard to the impurity of vessels, the term: Up to, is interpreted as up to and including in order to rule <b>stringently,</b> since the vessel is then more easily susceptible to impurity. <b>As Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All measures of the Sages</b> must be interpreted <b>stringently, except for</b> the measure of <b>a groat</b> as a standard <b>for stains</b> of blood found on a woman’s clothing, which is interpreted <b>leniently.</b> Even if the stain is exactly the size of a groat, the woman remains pure. Here, it is more stringent to interpret the phrase: Up to, as up to and including, because an animal is then more susceptible to being rendered a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara notes: The language <b>is also precise,</b> i.e., it is evident that the phrase: Up to, is always interpreted stringently, as the mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 19:2) states that if a rope extending from a rope bed is of any length up to five handbreadths, it is not susceptible to ritual impurity, but if it is of any length from five up to ten handbreadths, it is susceptible. And a <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches with regard to that</b> mishna: If the rope was exactly <b>five</b> handbreadths long, it is treated <b>as</b> though its length were <b>above</b> that; if the rope was exactly <b>ten</b> handbreadths long, it is treated <b>as</b> though its length were <b>below</b> that. In both cases, the measure is interpreted stringently.
§ The mishna states: If <b>the spleen was removed</b> the animal remains kosher. <b>Rav Avira says in the name of Rava:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that it is kosher <b>only</b> when the spleen was <b>removed, but</b> if it was <b>perforated,</b> it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin, and some say Rabbi Yosei bar Zevida, raises an objection</b> from a mishna in the next chapter (68a): If, prior to slaughtering an animal, one <b>severs</b> pieces <b>from a fetus that is in</b> the <b>womb</b> and leaves those pieces in the womb, their <b>consumption</b> is <b>permitted</b> by virtue of the slaughter of the mother animal (see 69a). By contrast, if one severs pieces <b>of the spleen or of the kidneys</b> of an animal and then slaughters it, then even if those pieces are left inside the animal their <b>consumption</b> is <b>prohibited,</b> because an organ severed from a living being is not permitted by the subsequent slaughter of the animal. One can infer from the mishna <b>that the animal itself is permitted</b> even when part of the spleen was severed. Evidently, such an animal is not a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara responds: <b>The same is true</b> of the animal, and <b>even the animal is prohibited.</b> But <b>since</b> the mishna <b>taught</b> in <b>the first clause,</b> with regard to the parts of the fetus: Their <b>consumption is permitted, it taught</b> in <b>the last clause</b> with regard to the parts of the spleen: Their <b>consumption is prohibited,</b> to contrast between them. <b>Or, if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>a perforated</b> spleen is <b>a discrete</b> case, in which the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>and a cut</b> spleen is <b>a discrete</b> case, in which the animal is not.
§ The mishna states: If <b>the kidneys were removed</b> the animal remains kosher. <b>Rakhish bar Pappa said in the name of Rav:</b> If an animal was <b>diseased in</b> even <b>one kidney,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say: And this</b> applies only in a case <b>where the disease reached</b>

Daf 55b

<b>the location of the crevice. And where is the location of the crevice?</b> This is a reference <b>to the white</b> matter <b>under the loins. Rav Neḥunya said: I asked all the authorities on <i>tereifot</i> of the West, and they said to me: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rakhish bar Pappa</b> in the name of Rav that a diseased kidney renders an animal a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>but the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Avira</b> that a perforated spleen renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara adds: And <b>even</b> with regard to the opinion <b>of Rav Avira, we said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with his opinion <b>only</b> if the spleen was perforated <b>in its narrow,</b> lower <b>end, but</b> if it was perforated <b>in its thick,</b> upper <b>end,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And</b> even if it was perforated in its thick end, <b>if</b> it was not perforated completely and a layer of the spleen <b>as thick as a gold dinar remains</b> intact, the animal is <b>kosher.</b>
§ <b>They say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>Any</b> injury <b>that renders</b> an animal <b>unfit</b> for consumption when occurring <b>in the lung is kosher</b> when occurring <b>in the kidney.</b> For example, <b>a perforation</b> renders an animal <b>unfit</b> when occurring <b>in the lung</b> (see 42a), <b>but</b> the animal <b>is kosher</b> if it occurs <b>in the kidney. And</b> it follows that <b>all the more so, where</b> an animal <b>is kosher</b> despite an injury <b>in the lung,</b> it will remain <b>kosher</b> despite a similar injury <b>in the kidney.</b>
<b>Rabbi Tanḥuma objects to this: And is this</b> an established <b>principle? But</b> what about a case of <b>pus, where</b> the animal is <b>kosher</b> if it occurs <b>in the lung and unfit</b> for consumption if it occurs <b>in the kidney? And</b> what about <b>clear fluid, which is kosher</b> both <b>here and there,</b> i.e., whether occurring in the lungs or the kidney? <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: Are</b> you <b>comparing <i>tereifot</i> to one another? One cannot say with regard to <i>tereifot</i>: This is similar to that, as one cuts</b> an animal <b>from here,</b> in one place, <b>and it dies,</b> while <b>one cuts it from there,</b> in another place, <b>and it lives.</b> Certain injuries may compromise the kidney but not the lung, or vice versa.
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>clear fluid</b> found in the lungs or kidney, which is <b>kosher, we said</b> so <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the fluid was <b>unclouded, but</b> if it was <b>clouded,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And even when</b> the fluid was <b>unclouded, we said</b> the animal is kosher <b>only</b> if the fluid <b>is not fetid, but if it is fetid,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
The Gemara continues to discuss cases of <i>tereifot</i> due to the kidneys: With regard to <b>a kidney that shrank, in small</b> animals, such as sheep, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if it shrank <b>until</b> the size <b>of a bean; in large</b> animals, such as cattle, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if it shrank <b>until</b> the size <b>of an intermediate-</b>sized <b>grape.</b>
§ The mishna states: If the animal’s <b>lower jaw was removed,</b> it remains kosher. With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Zeira says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <b>only when</b> the animal <b>is able to live by placing</b> food in its mouth <b>or stuffing</b> it down its throat. <b>But</b> if <b>it cannot live by placing or stuffing</b> food into it, it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
§ The mishna states: If <b>its womb [<i>em</i>] was removed,</b> the animal remains kosher. A Sage <b>taught: The <i>em</i> is</b> synonymous with the <b><i>tarpaḥat</i>, and it is</b> synonymous with the <b><i>shalpuḥit</i>.</b>
§ The mishna states: <b>Or</b> if its lung <b>shriveled [<i>ḥaruta</i>] by the hand of Heaven,</b> the animal is <b>kosher. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which is a <i>ḥaruta</i>?</b> It is <b>any</b> animal <b>whose lung shriveled.</b> If this occurred <b>by the hand of Heaven,</b> e.g., if the lung shriveled from fright of thunder and lightning, the animal is <b>kosher.</b> But if it happened <b>by the hands of a person</b> who frightened it, e.g., if it witnessed another animal being slaughtered, it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Even</b> if the lung shriveled <b>by the hands of any creature,</b> e.g., if it was frightened by a lion’s roar.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Is</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar referring to the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, in which case the statement is <b>a leniency,</b> and even the roar of a lion is considered by the hand of Heaven? <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it is referring to the latter clause, and</b> the statement is <b>a stringency,</b> and a lung shriveled by the hand of any creature renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as it is taught</b> in the above <i>baraita</i>: A lung that was <b>shriveled by the hands of a person</b> renders the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Even by the hands of any creature.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar is referring to the latter clause.
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana was walking in the desert,</b> and <b>he found certain rams whose lungs were shriveled. He came and asked</b> in <b>the study hall</b> how one can determine the cause of the shriveling. The Sages <b>said to him: In the summer, bring white vessels and fill them with cold water and set</b> the lungs in them <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period. If they go back</b> to appearing <b>healthy,</b> i.e., if they expand, one knows that <b>it was by the hand of Heaven and</b> the animals are <b>kosher; but if</b> they do <b>not</b> expand, the animals are <b><i>tereifa</i>. In the winter, bring dark vessels and fill them with tepid water, and set</b> the lungs in them <b>for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period. If</b> they <b>go back</b> to appearing <b>healthy,</b> they are <b>kosher; but if not,</b> they are <b><i>tereifa</i>.</b>
§ The mishna states: In the case of an animal <b>whose hide was removed,</b> Rabbi Meir deems it kosher, and the Rabbis deem it a <i>tereifa</i>. With regard to this, <b>the Sages taught:</b> In the case of an animal <b>whose hide was removed, Rabbi Meir deems it kosher, and the Rabbis deem it</b> a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption. <b>And Elazar the scribe and Yoḥanan ben Gudgeda already testified</b> before the Sages <b>with regard to</b> an animal <b>whose hide was removed that</b> it is <b>unfit</b> for consumption. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Rabbi Meir retracted</b> his statement.
The Gemara objects: <b>By inference,</b> one may conclude that <b>according to Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, Rabbi Meir</b> initially <b>disagreed with regard to</b> an animal <b>whose hide was removed. But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Rabbi Meir and the Sages did not disagree with regard to</b> an animal <b>whose hide was removed,</b> and all agree <b>that it is unfit</b> for consumption. <b>And Rabbi Oshaya, son of Rabbi Yehuda the spice merchant, already testified before Rabbi Akiva in the name of Rabbi Tarfon with regard to</b> an animal <b>whose hide was removed that it is unfit</b> for consumption. <b>And if</b> a piece of hide the same size <b>as a <i>sela</i> remained</b> intact, the animal is <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara explains the objection: The phrase: Did not disagree, indicates that Rabbi Meir never disagreed with the Sages. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>Did not disagree?</b> It means that <b>Rabbi Meir did not stand</b> firm <b>in his disagreement</b> and retracted.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said: If</b> a piece of hide the same size <b>as a <i>sela</i> remained</b> intact <b>in</b> the animal, it is <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Where</b> must this piece of hide be? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The piece of hide must be <b>along the entire spine.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does Shmuel mean <b>that</b> it is kosher if <b>a long and thin</b> strip of hide remains along the spine, such <b>that when</b> one <b>combines its</b> area, it will <b>constitute</b> the same size <b>as a <i>sela</i>? Or perhaps</b> it is kosher only if the remaining hide is <b>the width of a <i>sela</i> along the entire spine?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from that <b>which Rabbi Nehorai explained in the name of Shmuel:</b> It must be <b>the width of a <i>sela</i> along the entire spine.</b>
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says:</b> There must be a piece of hide the size of a <i>sela</i> on <b>the tips of</b> all <b>segments</b> of the spine and on the tips of the femur and tibia. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Antigonus says in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yannai:</b> The piece of hide must be the width of a <i>sela</i> at <b>the place of its navel.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yannai, son of Rabbi Yishmael, raises a dilemma:</b> If all the hide covering <b>the place of the spine was removed, but all of</b> the remaining hide <b>was intact,</b> or if the hide covering <b>the place of its navel was removed but all of</b> the remaining hide <b>was intact,</b> or if the hide covering all the <b>tips of the segments were removed but all of</b> the remaining hide <b>was intact, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav says: Any</b> portion of <b>the hide</b> that is the size of a <i>sela</i> <b>saves</b> an animal <b>whose hide was removed</b> from becoming a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>except for the hide of the hooves,</b> which is not considered hide. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even the hide of the hooves saves</b> it.
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabbi Asi asked Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> With regard to the <b>hide of the hooves, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does it <b>save</b> an animal <b>whose hide was removed</b> if a piece of it the size of a <i>sela</i> remains? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: It saves</b> the animal. Rabbi Asi <b>said to him:</b> But didn’t <b>you teach us, our teacher,</b> the following mishna (122a): <b>These</b> are the entities <b>whose hide is like their flesh</b> in terms of halakhic status, in that it transmits ritual impurity…the skin of a head of a young calf, and <b>the hide of the hooves?</b> Evidently, the hide of the hooves is considered like flesh and not true skin. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Do not trouble me</b> by invoking that mishna, <b>as I teach it in the singular.</b> Only according to one Sage, Rabbi Shimon, is the hide of the hooves not true skin; according to the Rabbis, it is considered true skin.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who slaughters a burnt offering</b> with intent <b>to burn an olive-bulk of the hide beneath the tail outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> i.e., outside the Temple courtyard, renders the offering <b>unfit, but there is no</b> liability for <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]</b> for one who partakes of the offering. If he had intent to burn it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> then it is rendered <b><i>piggul</i>, and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> partaking of <b>it.</b> This <i>halakha</i> usually applies to an offering’s flesh but not its hide. Since the hide beneath the tail is soft, it is treated like part of the flesh. This is the opinion of the Rabbis.
<b>Eliezer ben Yehuda of Evlayim said in the name of Rabbi Ya’akov, and so says Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda of Ikos in the name of Rabbi Shimon: Whether the hide of the hooves, or the hide of the head of a young calf, or the hide beneath the tail, or any</b> hide <b>that the Sages listed with regard to ritual impurity</b> under the heading: <b>These</b> are the entities <b>whose hide is like their flesh</b> in terms of halakhic status,

Daf 56a

<b>including the hide of the vulva,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is the same: If one performs the sacrificial rites with intent to burn one of them <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> the offering is <b>unfit, but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i></b> for one who partakes of the offering. If he had intent to burn it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> this renders it <b><i>piggul</i>, and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> eating <b>it.</b> This <i>baraita</i> indicates that only Rabbi Shimon holds that the hide of the hooves is treated like its flesh, and that the Sages disagree, as Rabbi Yoḥanan stated.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And these are <i>tereifot</i> in a bird:</b> One with <b>a perforated gullet, or</b> with <b>a cut windpipe</b> that was cut across its width; or if <b>a weasel struck</b> the bird <b>on its head</b> in <b>a place that renders it a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> as one must be concerned that the membrane of the brain was perforated; or if <b>the gizzard was perforated;</b> or if <b>the small intestines were perforated.</b> In a case where a bird <b>fell into the fire and its innards were singed [<i>neḥmeru</i>], if</b> they turned <b>green</b> they are <b>unfit,</b> and the bird is a <i>tereifa</i>, but <b>if</b> they are <b>red</b> the bird is <b>kosher.</b> If a person <b>trampled</b> the bird, <b>or slammed it against a wall, or if an animal crushed it and it is twitching,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i> because its limbs were shattered. <b>But</b> if the bird <b>lasted for</b> a twenty-four-hour <b>period, and</b> then <b>one slaughtered it,</b> it is <b>kosher.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states: If a weasel struck the bird on its head in a place that renders it a <i>tereifa</i>, one must be concerned that the membrane of the brain was perforated. <b>Rav and Shmuel and Levi say:</b> How does one inspect the membrane? After slaughter, one <b>inserts his hand into</b> the mouth of the bird and pushes the nerve tissue with his finger <b>and inspects</b> it. <b>If</b> the nerve tissue <b>emerges and rises</b> out through the hole in the skull, the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> because this proves that the membrane has been perforated, allowing the nerve tissue through. <b>And if not,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> (45a) that an animal is not a <i>tereifa</i> <b>unless the inner membrane is perforated</b> as well. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the animal is rendered a <i>tereifa</i> if <b>the outer</b> membrane <b>was perforated, even if the inner</b> membrane <b>was not perforated,</b> how can one rely on this inspection? <b>Let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps the outer</b> membrane <b>was perforated</b> but <b>the inner</b> membrane <b>was not perforated,</b> in which case the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> even if the nerve tissue does not emerge through the hole. The Gemara responds: <b>If it is</b> the case <b>that the outer</b> membrane <b>was perforated, the inner membrane will</b> inevitably <b>burst due to its fragility,</b> allowing the nerve tissue to emerge. If it does not emerge, it is certain that the outer membrane is intact as well.
<b>Ze’eiri says: There is no</b> effective <b>inspection for</b> a bird bitten on the head by <b>a weasel, because</b> the weasel’s <b>teeth are</b> so <b>thin</b> that even if they perforate the membrane, the nerve tissue will not emerge through the perforations. The Gemara asks: <b>And if its teeth are thin, what of it?</b> Certainly a small amount will emerge through the perforation. <b>Rav Oshaya said:</b> There is no inspection <b>because its teeth are fine and crooked.</b> The hole in the skull does not overlap the perforation in the membrane, and nothing will be able to escape.
The Gemara recounts: <b>When</b> Ze’eiri <b>went up to Neharde’a, he sent</b> a message <b>to</b> the Sages: <b>The matters that I stated before you are an error on my part. In fact, they said this in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: One inspects</b> a bird bitten on the head by <b>a weasel with</b> one’s <b>hand,</b> pressing against the nerve tissue to see if it emerges through the hole, <b>but not with a nail.</b> One may not inspect it by dragging the tip of a nail over the surface of the membrane to see if it catches on a perforation, since the nail itself may perforate the membrane. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> One may <b>even</b> inspect it <b>with a nail.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this disagreement is also reflected <b>in the dispute of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Neḥemya,</b> wherein <b>one inspected</b> the bird <b>by hand, and one inspected</b> it <b>with a needle. The one who inspected</b> it <b>by hand said to the one who inspected</b> it <b>with a needle: Until when will you waste the money of the Jewish people</b> by causing them to discard kosher meat? Sometimes the needle itself will perforate a membrane that was initially whole. <b>The one who inspected</b> it <b>with a needle said to the one who inspected</b> it <b>by hand: Until when will you feed carcasses to the Jewish people,</b> as you permit for consumption a bird that might well be forbidden?
The Gemara asks: <b>Carcasses? But</b> this is a <b>slaughtered</b> animal; even if it is forbidden, it is a <i>tereifa</i>, not a carcass. <b>Rather,</b> he must have said: Until when will you feed <b><i>tereifot</i></b> to the Jewish people; <b>perhaps the membrane of the brain was perforated.</b> Inspection by hand is not reliable, since the teeth of the weasel are thin and crooked and the nerve tissue may not escape even if the membrane is perforated.
The Gemara notes: <b>It may be concluded that it is Rabbi Yehuda who inspected</b> it <b>by hand, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda</b> that <b>one may inspect</b> a bird bitten on the head by <b>a weasel with</b> one’s <b>hand, but not with a nail.</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: If <b>the bone</b> of the skull <b>was broken, even if the membrane of the brain was not perforated,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara affirms: Indeed, <b>it may be concluded</b> that Rabbi Yehuda permits inspection only by hand.
The Gemara objects: <b>This itself</b> is <b>difficult. You said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may inspect</b> a bird injured by <b>a weasel with</b> one’s <b>hand, but not with a nail; apparently, it has</b> an option of <b>inspection. But you then teach:</b> If <b>the bone</b> of the skull <b>was broken, even if the membrane of the brain was not perforated,</b> the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>; <b>apparently it has no inspection,</b> because inspecting for a perforation would be pointless. The Gemara responds: In <b>the latter clause, we come to</b> discuss <b>a water bird,</b> which cannot be inspected, <b>since it has no membrane.</b> The Gemara clarifies: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that it <b>has no membrane?</b> One can see that it does. <b>Rather,</b> the response is: <b>Since its membrane is fragile,</b> it must have ruptured when the skull was broken.
Similarly, the Gemara relates that <b>Rav Naḥman said to Rav Anan: The Master says</b> that <b>Shmuel inspects</b> a bird bitten on the head by a weasel <b>with</b> his <b>hand and deems it kosher</b> if the membrane is not perforated, <b>and our colleague</b> Rav <b>Huna</b> also <b>says that Rav inspects</b> it <b>by hand and deems it kosher. But doesn’t Levi teach:</b> Those <b><i>tereifot</i> that the Sages enumerated in an animal</b> apply <b>likewise in a bird,</b> and <b>in addition to those, a bird</b> is a <i>tereifa</i> if <b>the bone</b> of the skull <b>was broken, even if the membrane of the brain was not perforated?</b> If so, how can a bird be permitted through inspection? Rav Anan <b>said to him: That</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a water bird,</b> which cannot be inspected <b>since it has no membrane.</b> The Gemara clarifies: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that it <b>has no membrane? Rather,</b> the response is: <b>Since its membrane is fragile.</b>
Similarly, the Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain hen that was in the house of Rav Ḥana</b> whose skull was injured. <b>He sent it before Rav Mattana,</b> who inspected it and found that <b>the bone</b> of the skull <b>was broken but the membrane of the brain was not perforated, and he deemed it kosher.</b> Rav Ḥana <b>said to</b> Rav Mattana: <b>But doesn’t Levi teach:</b> Those <b><i>tereifot</i> that the Sages enumerated in an animal</b> hold <b>likewise in a bird,</b> and <b>in addition to those, a bird</b> is a <i>tereifa</i> if <b>the bone</b> of the skull <b>was broken, even if the membrane of the brain was not perforated?</b> Rav Mattana <b>said to him: That</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a water bird,</b> which cannot be inspected <b>since it has no membrane.</b> The Gemara clarifies: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that it <b>has no membrane? Rather, say</b> that his response was: <b>Since its membrane is fragile.</b>
The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Sheizvi would inspect</b> the membrane of the brain <b>by</b> the light of <b>the sun. Rav Yeimar would inspect</b> it <b>by</b> pouring <b>water</b> into the skull through the hole, to see if it emerges mixed with nerve tissue. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov would inspect</b> it

Daf 56b

<b>by</b> dragging <b>a wheat straw</b> over the membrane to see if it would catch on a perforation.
<b>Rav Sheizvi said: Our geese are considered like water birds.</b> If the skull of a goose is broken, even if the membrane is not perforated, it is a <i>tereifa</i>.
§ The mishna states: In a case where a bird <b>fell into the fire</b> and its innards were singed, if they turned green the bird is a <i>tereifa</i>; if they are red the bird is kosher. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yosei ben Yehoshua: The measure of their</b> turning <b>green is like the measure of their perforation. Just as their perforation in any amount</b> renders them a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>so too their turning green in any amount</b> renders them a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Rav Yosef, son of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: If a liver turned green</b> on the side <b>facing the intestines, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said to him:</b> The bird is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: But</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>should be no more</b> stringent than that of a case where the liver was <b>removed</b> and an olive-bulk remained (see 54a), in which case the bird is kosher. Therefore, as long as an olive-bulk remains red, the bird should be kosher. <b>Rava said: Since the liver turned green facing the intestines, it is certain that</b> the bird <b>fell into the fire and the intestines</b> themselves <b>were singed, and</b> this is why the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> not because of the liver per se.
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi had a certain hen</b> that fell into the fire. After it was slaughtered, <b>he sent it before the distinguished Rabbi Elazar HaKappar and said to him:</b> Its innards <b>were green, and</b> Rabbi Elazar HaKappar <b>deemed it kosher.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi asked: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: If they turned <b>green</b> they are <b>unfit?</b> Rabbi Elazar HaKappar said to him: The Sages <b>said</b> that if they turned <b>green</b> they are <b>unfit only with regard to the gizzard, the heart, and the liver,</b> which are naturally red. Other innards of a hen, such as the intestines, are naturally green, and a green appearance in them does not render the hen a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara notes: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Concerning which innards did they say</b> that a green appearance renders the bird a <i>tereifa</i>? Only <b>concerning the gizzard, the heart, and the liver.</b>
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef had a certain hen</b> that fell into the fire. After it was slaughtered, <b>he sent it before Rabbi Abbahu and said to him:</b> Its innards <b>were red, and</b> Rabbi Elazar HaKappar <b>deemed it a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Yosef asked: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: If they are <b>red,</b> the bird is <b>kosher?</b> Rabbi Elazar HaKappar <b>said to him: Red</b> innards <b>that turned green and green</b> innards <b>that turned red</b> render the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> The Sages <b>said</b> in the mishna that <b>red</b> innards <b>are kosher only with regard to the heart, the gizzard, and the liver,</b> because these organs are naturally red. Organs that are naturally green, however, render the bird a <i>tereifa</i> if they have turned red.
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Ḥiyya says</b> that <b>Rabbi Mani says:</b> If <b>red</b> organs <b>turned green, and one boiled them and they turned red again, they are kosher. What is the reason?</b> This proves that they were not burned; rather, <b>smoke entered them</b> and changed their color temporarily. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: We, too, will say:</b> If <b>red</b> organs <b>did not turn green, and one boiled them and they</b> then <b>turned green,</b> the animal is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. What is the reason? Their shame was revealed,</b> i.e., it is evident that they were in fact burned. <b>Rav Ashi said: Therefore,</b> even if a bird’s innards remain red after it fell in a fire, <b>a person may eat it only</b> if it is <b>boiled,</b> to be certain that the innards will not turn green. The Gemara rejects this: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so,</b> since <b>we do not presume</b> the existence of <b>a flaw</b> without evidence.
§ The mishna states: If a person <b>trampled</b> the bird, <b>or slammed it against a wall,</b> or if an animal crushed it, and it lasted twenty-four hours, and then one slaughtered it, it is kosher. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Antigonus says in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yannai: Both this and that,</b> i.e., all of the above cases, <b>require inspection</b> after slaughter, to ascertain that there is no injury that would itself render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And these are kosher among birds:</b> If a bird’s <b>windpipe was perforated or cracked</b> lengthwise; or if <b>a weasel struck</b> the bird <b>on its head</b> in <b>a place that does not render it a <i>tereifa</i>;</b> or if <b>the crop was perforated. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> It is kosher <b>even</b> if the crop <b>was removed.</b> If the bird’s <b>intestines emerged</b> from the abdominal wall <b>but were not perforated,</b> or if <b>its wings were broken,</b> or if <b>its legs were broken,</b> or if the feathers on <b>its wings were plucked,</b> the bird is kosher. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If the down</b> covering its body <b>was removed,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Simai and Rabbi Tzadok, who went to intercalate the year in Lod, and they spent Shabbat in</b> the town of <b>Ono. And they ruled with regard to</b> an animal whose <b>womb</b> was removed, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi in the mishna <b>with regard to the crop.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: What is the meaning of the <i>baraita</i>? Is it referring to two different rulings, i.e., that <b>they ruled with regard to the womb to prohibit</b> it, and they also ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>with regard to the crop to permit</b> it? <b>Or perhaps</b> it is referring to only one ruling, and it means that <b>they ruled with regard to the womb to permit</b> it, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>with regard to the crop, but they do not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>with regard to the crop</b> itself. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rabba says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> who says: <b>The roof the crop is treated like the gullet,</b> i.e., it renders the bird a <i>tereifa</i> if perforated in any amount. The Gemara asks: <b>Where</b> is the roof of the crop? <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said:</b> It is <b>any</b> part of the crop <b>that stretches with</b> the gullet.
§ The mishna states: If the bird’s <b>intestines emerged</b> from the stomach wall but were not perforated, the bird is kosher. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one did not jumble them,</b> but returned them to the stomach in their proper order. <b>But</b> if <b>he jumbled them,</b> the bird is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, as it is written: “Has He not made you, and established you?”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:6). The verse <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created established</b> locations for each organ <b>in a person,</b> so <b>that if one of them is switched he cannot live.</b> The same applies to other creatures.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir would say</b> that the verse: <b>“Has He not made you, and established you?”</b> teaches that the Jewish people is <b>a city with everything in it. Out of it</b> come <b>its priests, out of it</b> come <b>its prophets, out of it</b> come <b>its chiefs, out of it</b> come <b>its kings, as it is stated: “Out of them shall come forth the cornerstone, out of them the stake,</b> out of them the battle bow, out of them every master together” (Zechariah 10:4).
The Gemara recounts an incident involving <b>a certain Roman who saw a certain man fall from the roof to the ground,</b> and <b>his stomach ruptured and his intestines emerged.</b> The Roman <b>brought</b> the man’s <b>son and slaughtered him before</b> his father’s eyes

Daf 57a

<b>deceptively,</b> i.e., he only pretended to kill the son. The father <b>fainted and went limp.</b> By this movement, <b>his intestines entered</b> his stomach, and the Roman <b>sewed up his stomach,</b> and he recovered.
§ The mishna states: If <b>its legs were broken,</b> the bird remains kosher. The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain basket of birds</b> with broken legs <b>that came before Rava. Rava inspected</b> each bird <b>at the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh, <b>and</b> when he found that all its sinews were intact, <b>he deemed it kosher.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: A dislocated foreleg in an animal is kosher. A dislocated femur in an animal</b> renders it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. A dislocated femur in a bird</b> renders it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. A dislocated wing in a bird</b> renders it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> because <b>we</b> must be <b>concerned</b> that <b>perhaps the lung was perforated.</b> The lung is located near the wing’s attachment to the body, and part of the lung may have been torn out with the wing. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> The lung <b>should be inspected,</b> and if no damage is found, the bird is kosher. <b>And so says Rabbi Yoḥanan: It should be inspected.</b>
<b>Ḥizkiyya,</b> son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, <b>says: A bird has no lungs. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> A bird <b>does have</b> lungs, <b>and they are like a rose petal</b> in appearance, thin and red, <b>between the wings.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does Ḥizkiyya mean when he says that <b>a bird has no lungs? If we say that it has no</b> lungs <b>at all,</b> that is problematic, as <b>don’t we see that it does have</b> lungs? <b>Rather,</b> say that he means <b>that</b> the bird <b>is not rendered a <i>tereifa</i> by them</b> if they are perforated. But this, too, is problematic, as <b>doesn’t Levi teach:</b> Those <b><i>tereifot</i> that the Sages enumerated in an animal</b> hold <b>likewise in a bird,</b> and <b>in addition to those, a bird</b> is a <i>tereifa</i> if <b>the bone</b> of the skull <b>was broken, even if the membrane of the brain was not perforated?</b> If so, a perforated lung in a bird, as in an animal, renders it a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Rather,</b> say that Ḥizkiyya means that a bird’s lung <b>has no</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b>falling and no</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b>singeing.</b> If a bird falls, one need not inspect the lungs for damage as he must other organs (see 51b), and if it falls in a fire, one need not inspect the lungs for a change in color as he must other organs (see 56b). <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Rav Ḥana said: Since a majority of</b> the bird’s <b>ribs protect</b> the lungs, one need not be concerned that the lung was damaged.
The Gemara asks: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> in response: A bird <b>does have</b> lungs, <b>and they are like a rose petal between the wings, by inference</b> one must conclude <b>that Ḥizkiyya maintains that it has no</b> lungs at all. <b>Rather,</b> one must say as <b>they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina: From the statement of the Distinguished,</b> i.e., Ḥizkiyya, <b>it is apparent that he is unfamiliar with chickens.</b>
§ <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said: A dislocated femur in a bird is kosher. Rabba bar Rav Huna said to Rav Huna: But the Rabbis that came from Pumbedita said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says in the name of Rav: A dislocated femur in a bird</b> renders it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: My son, each river and its course,</b> i.e., different communities observe different customs. Although Rav himself held that such a bird is kosher, he ruled for those living in Pumbedita that such a bird is a <i>tereifa</i>, in accordance with their own custom.
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabbi Abba went</b> and <b>found Rav Yirmeya bar Abba inspecting</b> birds <b>at the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh. Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: Why</b> must <b>Master</b> do <b>all this? But doesn’t Rav Huna say</b> that <b>Rav</b> says: <b>A dislocated femur in a bird is kosher?</b> If a bird is kosher even when the whole thigh has been removed, all the more so it should be kosher when only the convergence of sinews has been removed. Rav Yirmeya bar Abba <b>said to him: I know the mishna</b> (76a): With regard to <b>an animal whose hind legs were severed,</b> if they were severed <b>from the leg joint and below,</b> it is <b>kosher; from the leg joint and above,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption. <b>And likewise</b> an animal whose <b>convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh <b>was removed</b> is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And Rav said about this: And likewise with regard to a bird.</b>
Rabbi Abba responded: <b>If so,</b> this statement <b>of Rav,</b> that a bird whose convergence of sinews was removed is a <i>tereifa</i>, poses <b>a difficulty for</b> that statement <b>of Rav,</b> that a bird with a dislocated femur is kosher. Rav Yirmeya bar Abba <b>was silent</b> and did not respond. Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: Perhaps there is a difference for</b> Rav <b>between a dislocated</b> femur <b>and a severed</b> femur, and while the former does not render a bird a <i>tereifa</i>, the latter does. Rav Yirmeya bar Abba <b>said to him: And are you interpreting Rav’s <i>halakhot</i></b> based on your own reasoning? <b>Rav said explicitly: A dislocated</b> femur <b>is kosher,</b> while <b>a severed</b> femur renders the animal <b>unfit</b> for consumption. <b>And do not be confounded</b> by this distinction, <b>as</b> one <b>cuts</b> an animal <b>from here,</b> in one place, <b>and it dies,</b> but one <b>cuts it from there,</b> in another place, <b>and it lives.</b>
The Gemara recounts: <b>When Rabbi Abba went up</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rabbi Zeira sitting and saying: Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said</b> that <b>a dislocated femur in a bird</b> renders it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Rabbi Abba <b>said to him:</b> By <b>Master’s life, since the day that Master came up to here,</b> Eretz Yisrael,

Daf 57b

<b>we had the opportunity to speak with Rav Huna, and we asked him</b> about this matter, <b>and he said to us: A dislocated femur in a bird is kosher.</b>
<b>And I also found Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba sitting and inspecting</b> birds <b>at the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh. <b>And I</b> posed <b>a difficulty to him: Doesn’t Master maintain</b> in accordance with <b>this</b> statement <b>that Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: A dislocated femur in a bird is kosher?</b> Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba <b>said to me: I know the mishna</b> (76a): With regard to <b>an animal whose hind legs were severed,</b> if they were severed <b>from the leg joint and below,</b> it is <b>kosher; from the leg joint and above,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption. <b>And likewise</b> an animal whose <b>convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh <b>was removed</b> is a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And Rav said about this: And likewise with regard to a bird.</b>
<b>And I said to him: If so,</b> this statement <b>of Rav</b> poses <b>a difficulty for</b> that statement <b>of Rav.</b> Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba <b>was silent. And I challenged him: But perhaps there is a difference for Rav between a dislocated</b> femur <b>and a severed</b> one. <b>And he said to me: And are you interpreting Rav’s <i>halakha</i></b> based on your own reasoning? <b>Rav said explicitly: A dislocated</b> femur <b>is kosher,</b> while <b>a severed</b> femur renders the animal <b>unfit</b> for consumption.
Rabbi Abba then asked Rabbi Zeira: <b>And</b> as for <b>you, what is in your hand?</b> What have you heard with regard to this <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: This</b> is what <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi says</b> that <b>Rav says: A dislocated femur in a bird</b> renders it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And so said Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A dislocated femur in a bird</b> renders it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
<b>And</b> with regard to this, <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi said: If Rabbi Yoḥanan had been in the place where the assembly ruled to permit</b> such a bird, he would <b>not</b> have <b>stirred.</b> In other words, he would not have contested their ruling, because they were the greatest Sages of the previous generation. <b>As Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: A dislocated femur in a bird is kosher. And Rabbi Ḥanina had a hen whose femur was dislocated, and he brought it before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>permitted it to him, and Rabbi Ḥanina salted</b> the hen to preserve it. <b>And he would teach the students the <i>halakha</i> with it,</b> as he would show them the preserved body of the hen and say: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permitted this to me, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permitted this to me.</b>
The Gemara concludes: <b>But the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with any of these statements. Rather,</b> it is <b>in accordance with that which Rabbi Yosei ben Nehorai asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: In what amount</b> must <b>a windpipe</b> be <b>punctured</b> to render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said to him: We learned a full mishna</b> (54a): <b>Until</b> the perforation is the same size <b>as the Italian <i>issar</i>.</b> Rabbi Yosei ben Nehorai <b>said to him: But wasn’t there a certain ewe in our neighborhood whose windpipe was punctured</b> in a greater amount, <b>and they made</b> a seal <b>for</b> the windpipe out of <b>the shell of a reed and it lived?</b>
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said to him: And do you rely on this</b> incident as evidence? <b>But isn’t it a widespread <i>halakha</i> among the Jewish people</b> that <b>a dislocated femur in a bird</b> renders it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>? And</b> still, <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta had a hen whose femur was dislocated, and they made it</b> a support out of the <b>tube of a reed and it lived. Rather, what have you to say</b> about this case? It must have <b>occurred within twelve months</b> of the dislocation, and afterward the hen died, since no <i>tereifa</i> can live more than twelve months. <b>Here, too,</b> in the case of the punctured windpipe, the episode <b>occurred within twelve months</b> of the injury and the ewe later died.
§ <b>They said about Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta that he was a researcher of</b> various <b>matters, and he would act to counter the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, as Rabbi Yehuda would say: If the down</b> covering a bird’s body <b>was removed,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption, as stated in the mishna. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta had a hen whose down was removed, and he placed it in an oven,</b> a warm place, <b>and he covered it with a Coppersmiths’ [<i>tarsiyyim</i>] apron, and its new,</b> i.e., rehabilitated, <b>wings grew</b> even <b>more</b> feathers <b>than the original</b> wings.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how does this counter Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> can live and that its health can even <b>improve</b> beyond its previous state. The Gemara responds: Even <b>if</b> this is <b>so,</b> would Rabbi Yehuda say so <b>with regard to the</b> very <b>thing</b> with <b>which it was rendered a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> as is the case here, where <b>it grew new wings</b> with <b>more</b> feathers <b>than the original</b> wings?
The Gemara asks: From <b>what</b> episode did Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta earn the title: <b>Researcher of matters? Rav Mesharshiyya said:</b> He saw <b>that it is written: “Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise; which having no chief, overseer, or ruler, provides her bread in the summer”</b> (Proverbs 6:6–8). Rabbi Shimon ben Ḥalafta <b>said: I will go and see if it is correct that they have no king.</b>
<b>He went in the season of Tammuz,</b> i.e., summer. Knowing that ants avoid intense heat, <b>he spread his cloak over an ant hole</b> to provide shade. <b>One of</b> the ants <b>came out</b> and saw the shade. Rabbi Shimon <b>placed a distinguishing mark on</b> the ant. <b>It went into</b> the hole and <b>said to</b> the other ants: <b>Shade has fallen. They</b> all <b>came out</b> to work. Rabbi Shimon <b>lifted up his cloak,</b> and <b>the sun fell</b> on them. They all <b>fell upon</b> the first ant <b>and killed it. He said:</b> One may <b>learn from</b> their actions that <b>they have no king; as, if they had a king, would they not need the king’s edict [<i>harmana</i>]</b> to execute their fellow ant?
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: But perhaps the king was with them</b> at the time and gave them permission. <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>they</b> already <b>possessed the king’s edict</b> giving them license to kill the ant. <b>Or</b> perhaps it <b>was</b> an interregnum <b>between kings, as it is written: “In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did that which was right in his own eyes”</b> (Judges 17:6). <b>Rather, rely on the credibility of Solomon,</b> the author of Proverbs, that ants have no king.
§ <b>Rav Huna says: The sign of a <i>tereifa</i></b> is <b>twelve months.</b> If it is uncertain whether an animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, one may wait twelve months; if the animal survives, it is kosher. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The sign of a <i>tereifa</i></b> is <b>any</b> animal <b>that cannot give birth. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If its health <b>improves continuously, it is certainly kosher;</b> if its health <b>deteriorates continuously, it is certainly a <i>tereifa</i>. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: The sign of a <i>tereifa</i></b> is any animal that does not survive <b>thirty days.</b> The Sages <b>said to him: But don’t many</b> animals that are certainly <i>tereifot</i> <b>survive two</b> or <b>three years?</b> None of the opinions cited in the <i>baraita</i> accord with Rav Huna’s statement.
The Gemara responds: The matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And in a skull that contains one long hole,</b> or <b>even</b> if it has <b>many holes,</b> the areas of the holes <b>join together to</b> constitute the <b>size of a drill hole,</b> and they render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei ben HaMeshullam said:</b> There was <b>an incident in</b> a place called <b>Inbul involving one whose skull was missing</b> a piece, <b>and they made for him</b> a patch out of <b>the shell of a gourd, and he survived.</b> Therefore, an animal with a missing piece of skull cannot be a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said to him:</b> Can you bring <b>proof from there? It was summer</b> then, <b>and once winter came upon him he died immediately.</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar holds that an animal is a <i>tereifa</i> if it does not survive through summer and winter, i.e., one year. Rav Huna’s statement accords with this opinion.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> can give birth and</b> its health can even <b>improve.</b> If the animal appears to recover or gives birth, this does not prove it is not a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Ameimar says:</b> With regard to <b>these eggs of a <i>tereifa</i></b> bird,

Daf 58a

<b>the first clutch [<i>shiḥala</i>]</b> of eggs that were in its body at the time it was rendered a <i>tereifa</i> <b>is prohibited</b> for consumption, because these eggs are considered part of the bird and were therefore rendered <i>tereifa</i> along with it. But as for any egg fertilized <b>from this</b> point <b>forward, it is</b> a case where both <b>this and that cause</b> it, i.e., a <i>tereifa</i> female and a kosher male, <b>and</b> as a rule, when permitted and prohibited causes operate together, the joint result is <b>permitted.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi raised an objection to Ameimar</b> from a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 5:1): <b>And</b> all <b>agree with regard to the egg of a <i>tereifa</i></b> bird <b>that it is prohibited</b> for consumption, <b>because it grew in</b> a state of <b>prohibition.</b> Evidently, even eggs created after the bird was rendered a <i>tereifa</i> are prohibited. Ameimar said to him: <b>There,</b> the mishna is dealing <b>with</b> a bird <b>that is heated by the earth,</b> i.e., that was not fertilized by a male, and the female <i>tereifa</i> is therefore the sole source of the egg.
The Gemara objects: <b>And let</b> Ameimar <b>answer</b> differently, that the mishna is dealing <b>with the first clutch</b> of eggs, which were part of the mother’s body when it became a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara responds: <b>If</b> this was <b>so,</b> why does the mishna state: Because <b>it grew</b> in a state of prohibition? The mishna <b>should have</b> stated: Because it <b>was finished</b> in a state of prohibition.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> if the offspring in the womb of an animal becomes a <i>tereifa</i> along with it, then <b>that which we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> is difficult: With regard to the <b>offspring of a <i>tereifa</i>, Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>it shall not be sacrificed on the altar, and Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that <b>it may be sacrificed. With regard to what</b> case do they <b>disagree?</b> It must be <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where</b> the mother animal <b>was rendered a <i>tereifa</i> and afterward became pregnant</b> from a kosher male, and <b>Rabbi Eliezer holds:</b> In a case where <b>this and that cause</b> it, it is <b>prohibited, and Rabbi Yehoshua holds:</b> In a case where <b>this and that cause</b> it, it is <b>permitted.</b> But <b>if so, rather than disputing</b> whether it is permitted to sacrifice such offspring <b>to the Most High, let them disagree</b> concerning the more basic issue of whether the offspring is permitted <b>to an ordinary</b> person for consumption.
The Gemara responds: The dispute addresses the question of whether it is permitted to sacrifice the animal as an offering in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the lenient opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua, that</b> such an animal is <b>permitted even</b> as an offering <b>to the Most High.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But let them disagree</b> concerning whether the animal is permitted <b>to an ordinary</b> person in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature</b> of the stringent opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer, that</b> such an animal <b>is prohibited even to an ordinary</b> person. The Gemara responds: It is <b>preferable for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to emphasize <b>the power of leniency.</b>
The Gemara concludes: Since Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua disagree with regard to an offspring brought about by two causes, it follows that when the mishna states: <b>And</b> they <b>concede with regard to the egg of a <i>tereifa</i></b> bird <b>that it is prohibited</b> for consumption, this is <b>referring to</b> a bird <b>that is heated by the earth</b> and was not fertilized by a male, so <b>that there is</b> only <b>one cause,</b> the <i>tereifa</i> mother bird.
The Gemara notes: <b>Rav Aḥa holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov,</b> who said at the end of the previous <i>amud</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> animal can be capable of giving birth, and similarly a <i>tereifa</i> bird can be capable of laying eggs as well, <b>and he</b> therefore <b>teaches</b> the statement <b>of Ameimar as we have said,</b> that any egg fertilized after the bird became a <i>tereifa</i> is permitted.
But <b>Ravina does not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov.</b> Rather, he holds that a <i>tereifa</i> cannot produce eggs or give birth. <b>And he</b> therefore <b>teaches</b> the statement <b>of Ameimar in this formulation: Ameimar said</b> that with regard to <b>these eggs of</b> a bird concerning which it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: <b>We leave</b> aside <b>the first clutch</b> of eggs. <b>If</b> the bird <b>produces</b> eggs <b>again,</b> the first eggs <b>are permitted</b> for consumption, because the bird is certainly not a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>And if not, they are prohibited,</b> because they were considered part of the bird when it was rendered a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Rav Ashi raised an objection to Ameimar</b> from a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 5:1): <b>And they concede with regard to the egg of a <i>tereifa</i></b> bird <b>that it is prohibited</b> for consumption, <b>because it grew in</b> a state of <b>prohibition.</b> Evidently, a <i>tereifa</i> bird can produce eggs. Ameimar <b>said to him:</b> The mishna <b>there</b> deals <b>with the first clutch</b> of eggs, which existed before the bird became a <i>tereifa</i>. Rav Ashi asks: <b>If so,</b> why does the mishna state: Because <b>it grew</b> in a state of prohibition? The mishna <b>should have</b> stated: Because it <b>was finished</b> in a state of prohibition. Ameimar responded: <b>Teach</b> an emended version of the mishna: Because it <b>was finished</b> in a state of prohibition.
Rav Ashi asks: <b>But</b> if a <i>tereifa</i> cannot become pregnant, <b>that which we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> is difficult: With regard to <b>the offspring of a <i>tereifa</i>, Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>it shall not be sacrificed on the altar,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says</b> that <b>it may be sacrificed. With regard to what</b> case do they <b>disagree?</b> It must be <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where</b> the mother animal <b>became pregnant and</b> only <b>afterward was rendered a <i>tereifa</i>. Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that <b>a fetus is</b> considered like <b>the thigh of its mother</b> and is rendered a <i>tereifa</i> as part of its body, <b>and Rabbi Yehoshua holds</b> that <b>a fetus is not</b> considered like <b>the thigh of its mother.</b> The Gemara objects: But <b>if so, rather than disputing</b> whether it is permitted to sacrifice such offspring <b>to the Most High, let them dispute</b> the more basic issue of whether the offspring is permitted <b>to an ordinary</b> person for consumption.
The Gemara responds: The mishna discusses the question of whether it is permitted to sacrifice the animal as an offering in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature</b> of the lenient opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua</b> that such an animal is permitted even as an offering to the Most High. The Gemara suggests: <b>But let them dispute</b> whether the animal is permitted <b>to an ordinary</b> person, in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature</b> of the stringent opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer</b> that such an animal is prohibited even to an ordinary person. The Gemara responds: It is <b>preferable for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to emphasize <b>the power of leniency.</b>
The Gemara concludes: According to this explanation, when the mishna states: <b>And they certainly concede with regard to the egg of a <i>tereifa</i></b> bird <b>that it is prohibited</b> for consumption, it is dealing <b>with the first clutch</b> of eggs in the bird’s oviduct at the time it becomes a <i>tereifa</i>. Even Rabbi Yehoshua, who holds that the fetus of an animal is not considered like the thigh of its mother, concedes that a bird’s egg is rendered a <i>tereifa</i> along with it. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Rabbi Yehoshua holds that an egg <b>is</b> a true part of <b>its body.</b>
The Gemara rules: <b>And</b> with regard to an animal concerning which it is uncertain whether it is a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is: <b>In</b> the case of <b>a male,</b> it is prohibited for <b>an entire twelve-month</b> period. After that point, the animal is certainly kosher. <b>In</b> the case of <b>a female, any</b> animal <b>that does not give birth</b> is prohibited. Once it has, it is certainly kosher.
§ <b>Rav Huna says: Any creature that has no bones cannot last twelve months. Rav Pappa said:</b> One may <b>learn from Rav Huna’s</b> statement about <b>that which Shmuel says: If a serpent melon became infested by worms while attached to the ground</b> [<b><i>be’ibbeha</i></b>], the worm <b>is prohibited</b> for consumption, in accordance with the verse: “And every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41).

Daf 58b

<b>These dates</b> stored in <b>a jar are permitted after</b> remaining there for <b>twelve months</b> of <b>the year.</b> Since worms have no bones, they cannot last twelve months. Consequently, any worms found in the dates must have hatched after they were picked and are therefore permitted.
<b>Rav says: There is no one-day-old mosquito,</b> since all mosquitoes die before they have lived a day. <b>And there is no one-year-old fly.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But isn’t</b> there the adage that <b>people say</b> that <b>the female mosquito revolted against the male mosquito seven years, since she said to him: I saw a townsman swimming in the water, and he came out and wrapped himself in sheets, and you sat on him and sucked</b> blood <b>from him, and you did not inform me?</b> Apparently, some boneless creatures can survive at least seven years. Abaye <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning,</b> what about <b>that</b> adage <b>that people say: Six thousand iron dinars hang in a mosquito’s mallet,</b> i.e., its bite is powerful? <b>Is there</b> really such a thing? <b>How much does</b> the mosquito <b>itself</b> weigh? <b>Rather,</b> the saying must be referring <b>to hundreds of their own dinars,</b> i.e., the mosquitoes’ coins. <b>Here, too,</b> the adage is referring <b>to their own years,</b> not human years.
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Bekhorot</i> 40a): <b>With regard to an animal with five legs, or</b> one <b>that has only three, this is a blemish,</b> and the animal may not be brought as an offering. <b>Rav Huna said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>was missing or had an additional foreleg. But</b> if it <b>was missing or had an additional hind leg, it is also a <i>tereifa</i>. What is the reason?</b> It is that <b>any extra</b> limb <b>is considered like a removed</b> limb. An animal whose foreleg was removed is kosher, but if its hind leg was removed it is a <i>tereifa</i>; the same applies if it had an extra leg.
The Gemara recounts the case of <b>a certain animal that had two ceca. They brought it to Ravina, and he deemed it a <i>tereifa</i> based on</b> the statement <b>of Rav Huna</b> that an extra limb is like a missing limb. Since an animal missing a cecum is a <i>tereifa</i>, an animal with an extra cecum is likewise a <i>tereifa</i>. The Gemara adds: <b>But if they empty into each other,</b> such that food can move freely between them, the animal is <b>kosher,</b> because they are considered one organ.
The Gemara recounts the case of <b>a certain tube that exited from the reticulum into the omasum. Rav Ashi thought to deem</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Rav Huna Mar bar Ḥiyya said to Rav Ashi: All animals</b> that dwell <b>outside have</b> tubes like <b>this,</b> and one need not be concerned.
The Gemara recounts the case of <b>a certain tube that passed from the reticulum to the rumen. Mar bar Rav Ashi thought to deem</b> the animal <b>kosher,</b> as in the above case. <b>Rav Oshaya said to him: Is that to say all</b> such cases <b>are woven in one weave? Where it was stated</b> that such an organ is normal, <b>it was stated; where it was not stated, it was not stated.</b> This animal is a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Natan bar Sheila, head of the butchers of Tzippori, testified before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>about two intestines that exit</b> the abomasum of <b>the animal as one, that this</b> renders the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. But</b> if this phenomenon occurs <b>likewise in a bird,</b> it is <b>kosher,</b> because it is common in birds. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said,</b> i.e., that two intestines render an animal a <i>tereifa</i>? It is said in a case <b>where they exit at two different points. But</b> if <b>they exit at one point,</b> adjacent to each other, <b>and they end,</b> i.e., they merge into one intestine, <b>within a fingerbreadth,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b>
<b>Rav Ami and Rav Asi disagree with regard to</b> this <i>halakha</i>. <b>One says: It</b> is kosher when the two intestines exit at one point only in a case <b>where they subsequently merge</b> into one intestine; <b>and one says:</b> It is kosher <b>even if they do not subsequently merge.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <b>it</b> is kosher only in a case <b>where they subsequently merge, this</b> explanation is consistent with <b>that which</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: Within a fingerbreadth.</b> That is, the two intestines must merge within a fingerbreadth for the animal to be kosher. <b>But according to the one who says:</b> It is kosher <b>even if they do not subsequently merge, what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: And they end <b>within a fingerbreadth?</b> The Gemara responds: It means <b>within a fingerbreadth below.</b> As long as the intestines merge before the final fingerbreadth near the anus, the animal is kosher.
§ The mishna states: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If the down</b> covering its body <b>was removed,</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption, like an animal whose hide was removed. With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yishmael said the same thing. Rabbi Yehuda</b> said <b>that which we said</b> here, that the removal of the feathers is like removal of the hide. <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> agrees, <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: The down joins</b> the flesh to constitute an olive-bulk for purposes of <i>piggul</i>. If a priest pinches the nape of the neck of a bird with intent to consume a combined olive-bulk of its meat and its down beyond the permitted time, the offering is rendered <i>piggul</i>. Evidently, both Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yishmael agree that the down of a bird is considered like the hide of an animal.
<b>Rava said: Perhaps it is not so,</b> and they disagree. Perhaps <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the down is like the hide of an animal <b>here only with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, since</b> when the down is removed, <b>there is nothing that protects</b> the bird, and its life is in danger; <b>but with regard to <i>piggul</i>, he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> that the down is not treated like the hide of an animal, because <i>piggul</i> applies only if one had intent to consume an item that is normally consumed. <b>And</b> perhaps <b>Rabbi Yishmael says</b> so <b>there only with regard to <i>piggul</i>,</b> since he holds that the down is in fact fit for consumption; <b>but with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> he holds that the down <b>does not protect</b> the bird, and its removal does not endanger it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to an animal that is <b>congested with</b> excess <b>blood, or that</b> was <b>smoked,</b> i.e., that suffered from smoke inhalation, <b>or that</b> was <b>chilled</b> and subsequently became sick, <b>or that ate oleander,</b> which is poisonous, <b>or that ate the excrement of chickens, or that drank foul water,</b> although in all these cases the animal is in danger, it is <b>kosher.</b> By contrast, if the animal <b>ate deadly poison, or</b> if <b>a snake bit</b> the animal, <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b><i>tereifa</i>,</b> consumption of the animal would be <b>permitted, but</b> it is <b>prohibited due to the threat to</b> one’s <b>life</b> if he eats it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Shmuel says:</b> If one <b>fed</b> an animal <b>asafoetida,</b> a very sharp plant, it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. What is the reason? Since it perforates its intestines.</b>
<b>Rav Sheizvi raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: An animal that is <b>congested with</b> excess <b>blood, or that</b> suffered from <b>smoke</b> inhalation, <b>or that ate</b> poisonous <b>oleander, or that ate the excrement of roosters, or that drank foul water,</b> or if <b>one fed it <i>tia</i>, asafoetida, or peppers,</b> or if it <b>ate deadly poison,</b> it is <b>kosher.</b> But if <b>a snake bit</b> the animal, <b>or if a mad dog bit it, with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b><i>tereifa</i></b> its consumption is <b>permitted, but</b> it is nevertheless <b>prohibited due to the threat to</b> one’s <b>life.</b> The statement of the <i>baraita</i> concerning an animal that was fed <b>asafoetida</b> poses <b>a difficulty to</b> Shmuel’s statement that <b>asafoetida</b> renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, and the statement concerning <b>deadly poison</b> poses <b>a difficulty to</b> the mishna’s statement that <b>deadly poison</b> renders the animal prohibited due to the threat to one’s life.
The Gemara responds: The apparent contradiction between one statement about <b>asafoetida</b> and the other statement about <b>asafoetida</b> is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case where the animal ate asafoetida <b>leaves,</b> which are less dangerous. <b>There,</b> Shmuel is referring <b>to</b> a case where the animal ate <b>slivers</b> of asafoetida, which are very sharp. Likewise, the apparent contradiction between one statement about <b>deadly poison</b> and the other statement about <b>deadly poison</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement of the <i>baraita</i> that it is permitted is referring to a case where the animal consumed poison that is deadly only <b>to itself. That</b> statement of the mishna that it is prohibited is referring to a case where it consumed poison deadly <b>to a person.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Poison deadly to an animal is</b> the same as <b>oleander;</b> why should the <i>baraita</i> mention both? The Gemara responds: The <i>tanna</i> is referring to <b>two types of deadly poison.</b>
The above <i>baraita</i> teaches that if an animal was fed <i>tia</i>, it is kosher. The Gemara asks: <b>What is <i>tia</i>? Rav Yehuda said:</b>

Daf 59a

It is <b>the root of a bitter</b> vegetable.
<b>Rav Yehuda says: This</b> individual <b>who eats</b> the weight of <b>three shekel of asafoetida on an empty heart,</b> i.e., stomach, <b>his skin sheds</b> due to the fever he contracts. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: There was an incident in which I</b> was involved, wherein <b>I ate</b> the weight of <b>one shekel of asafoetida, and had I not</b> immediately <b>sat in water</b> to cool off, <b>my skin would have shed. And I</b> thereby <b>fulfilled with regard to myself</b> that which the verse states: <b>“Wisdom preserves the life of him that has it”</b> (Ecclesiastes 7:12).
<b>Rav Yosef says: This</b> individual <b>who eats sixteen eggs and forty nuts and seven fruits of the caper bush, and he drinks a quarter-<i>log</i> of honey in the season of Tammuz,</b> i.e., summer, all <b>on an empty heart,</b> i.e., stomach, <b>his heartstrings are uprooted.</b>
§ The mishna states that if an animal is bitten by a poisonous snake, it is not a <i>tereifa</i>, but it is nevertheless prohibited for consumption due to the hazard it poses. The Gemara recounts the case of <b>a certain young deer that was brought to the house of the Exilarch</b> after slaughter <b>whose hind legs had been cut. Rav inspected it at the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh and found them intact, <b>and he deemed it kosher. He thought to eat it rare,</b> i.e., lightly roasted. <b>Shmuel said to him: Is the Master not concerned for</b> the possibility that it may have <b>a snakebite?</b>
Rav <b>said to him: What is the rectification</b> for such an uncertainty? Shmuel said to him: <b>We shall set it in a</b> hot <b>oven, as it will</b> then <b>inspect itself.</b> Shmuel <b>set it</b> in the oven on a spit, and the meat <b>fell</b> off the bone <b>bit by bit,</b> a sign that a snake had bitten the young deer. <b>Shmuel recited about Rav</b> the verse: <b>“There shall no mischief befall the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 12:21), since he was saved due to his righteousness. <b>Rav recited about Shmuel</b> the verse: “And <b>no secret causes you trouble”</b> (Daniel 4:6), since he was learned even with regard to such matters.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The signs</b> that indicate that <b>a domesticated animal and an undomesticated animal</b> are kosher <b>were stated in the Torah, and the signs of</b> a kosher <b>bird were not</b> explicitly <b>stated. But the Sages stated</b> certain signs in a bird: <b>Any bird that claws</b> its prey and eats it is <b>non-kosher. Any</b> bird <b>that has an extra digit</b> behind the leg slightly elevated above the other digits, <b>and a crop,</b> which is a sack alongside the gullet in which food is stored prior to digestion, <b>and</b> for which the yellowish membrane inside <b>its gizzard can be peeled,</b> is <b>kosher. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: Any bird that splits</b> the digits of <b>its feet</b> when standing on a string, placing two digits on one side of the string and two on the other, is <b>non-kosher.</b>
<b>And with regard to grasshoppers,</b> whose signs were also not stated in the Torah, the Sages stated: <b>Any</b> grasshopper <b>that has four legs, and four wings, and</b> two additional <b>jumping legs, and whose wings cover most of its</b> body, is kosher. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: And</b> this applies only if the <b>name</b> of <b>its</b> species is <b>grasshopper. And with regard to fish,</b> the signs are explicitly stated in the Torah: <b>Any</b> fish <b>that has a fin and a scale</b> is kosher; <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Two scales and one fin. And these are scales:</b> Those <b>that</b> are <b>fixed to its</b> body; <b>and fins</b> are those <b>with which</b> the fish <b>swims.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that the signs of a kosher domesticated animal are stated in the Torah. With regard to this, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are the signs of a</b> kosher <b>domesticated animal: “Whatsoever parts the hoof,</b> and is wholly cloven-footed, and chews the cud, among the animals, that may you eat” (Leviticus 11:3). <b>Any animal that chews the cud certainly has no upper</b> front <b>teeth,</b> i.e., incisors, <b>and is kosher.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> this an established <b>principle? But</b> isn’t there <b>a camel, which chews the cud, and has no upper</b> front <b>teeth, and</b> it is still <b>non-kosher</b> (see Leviticus 11:4)? The Gemara responds: <b>A camel has cuspid</b>-like upper incisors, one on each side.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t there <b>a young camel, which does not even have cuspid</b>-like upper incisors and is still non-kosher? <b>And furthermore,</b> aren’t there the <b>hyrax and</b> the <b>hare, which chew the cud, and</b> yet <b>they have upper</b> front <b>teeth, and are non-kosher? And furthermore,</b> one might ask: <b>Are teeth written in the Torah</b> with regard to the kosher status of an animal? <b>Rather, this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: Any animal that does not have upper</b> front <b>teeth certainly chews the cud and parts the hoof and is kosher.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why should one inspect the teeth? <b>Let him</b> simply <b>inspect</b> whether <b>the hooves</b> are cloven. The Gemara responds: One inspects the teeth in a case <b>where its hooves were cut</b> and one cannot tell whether they are cloven. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda says:</b> If one <b>was walking in the wilderness, and he found an animal whose hooves were cut, he may inspect its mouth. If it has no upper</b> front <b>teeth, it is certainly kosher; if</b> that is <b>not</b> the case, <b>it is certainly non-kosher, provided that he recognizes</b> that this animal is not <b>a camel,</b> which is non-kosher even though it has no upper incisors. The Gemara asks: Why must one recognize that this is not <b>a camel?</b> A camel <b>has cuspid</b>-like upper incisors. <b>Rather,</b> say: <b>Provided that one recognizes</b> that it is not <b>a young camel,</b> which has no cuspid-like upper incisors.
The Gemara asks: How can one rely only on an inspection of the mouth? <b>Did you not say that there is a young camel,</b> which has no upper incisors but is still non-kosher? If so, perhaps <b>there is also another species that is similar to a young camel</b> and is non-kosher despite having no upper incisors. The Gemara responds that this possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“The camel, because it chews the cud</b> but parts not the hoof, it is unclean” (Leviticus 11:4). <b>The Ruler of His world knows that nothing other than</b> the <b>camel chews the cud and is</b> still <b>non-kosher. Therefore, the verse singles it out</b> with the word <b>“it,”</b> i.e., it and no other.
<b>And Rav Ḥisda says:</b> If one <b>was walking on the road, and he found an animal whose mouth was mutilated, he may inspect its hooves. If its hooves are cloven, it is certainly kosher. If not, it is certainly non-kosher.</b> This applies <b>provided that he recognizes</b> that it is not <b>a pig,</b> which is non-kosher even though it has cloven hooves.
The Gemara asks: But <b>didn’t you say that there is a pig,</b> which has cloven hooves but is still non-kosher? If so, perhaps <b>there is also another species that is similar to a pig.</b> The Gemara responds that this possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“And the pig, because it parts the hoof,</b> and is cloven-footed, but chews not the cud, it is unclean” (Leviticus 11:7). <b>The Ruler of His world knows that nothing other than</b> the <b>pig parts the hoof and is</b> still <b>non-kosher. Therefore, the verse singles it out</b> with the word <b>“it.”</b>
<b>And Rav Ḥisda says:</b> If one <b>was walking in the wilderness, and he found an animal whose mouth was mutilated and whose hooves were cut, he may inspect its flesh. If it runs</b> like <b>warp and woof,</b> i.e., part of it stretches vertically and part of it horizontally, <b>it is certainly kosher; and if not, it is certainly non-kosher, provided that one recognizes</b> that this animal is not <b>a wild donkey,</b> which is non-kosher even though its flesh runs like warp and woof.
The Gemara asks: <b>Didn’t you say that there is a wild donkey,</b> whose flesh runs like warp and woof but who is still non-kosher? If so, perhaps <b>there is also another species that is similar to a wild donkey.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>It is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that there are no</b> similar species. The Gemara asks: <b>And where does one inspect</b> the flesh? <b>Abaye said, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> said: <b>At the edges of the tailbone,</b> on the upper thighs.
§ The mishna states: <b>The signs of an undomesticated animal</b> were stated in the Torah. With regard to this, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are the signs of an undomesticated animal.</b> The Gemara interjects: Why does one need signs for an undomesticated animal? <b>An undomesticated animal [<i>ḥayya</i>] is included</b> in the category of <b>a domesticated animal [<i>behema</i>] with regard to signs,</b> as the verse states: “These are the living things [<i>ḥayya</i>] which you may eat among all the animals [<i>behema</i>] that are on the earth. Whatsoever parts the hoof” (Leviticus 11:2–3). <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b>

Daf 59b

The signs are given <b>to permit its</b> forbidden <b>fat,</b> i.e., to deem the animal undomesticated. Fat that is forbidden for consumption in domesticated animals is permitted in undomesticated animals. <b>And this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: These are the signs of a</b> kosher <b>undomesticated animal,</b> so that one will know <b>that its fat is permitted: Any</b> animal <b>that has horns and</b> cloven <b>hooves</b> is an undomesticated animal.
<b>Rabbi Dosa says:</b> If <b>it has horns,</b> it is certainly a kosher undomesticated animal, and <b>you need not search for</b> cloven <b>hooves.</b> But if <b>it has</b> cloven <b>hooves, you must</b> still <b>search for horns. And</b> with regard to the animal called <b>a <i>keresh</i>, even though it has only one horn,</b> its fat <b>is permitted</b> for consumption.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> this an established <b>principle? But</b> isn’t there <b>a goat, which has horns and</b> cloven <b>hooves, and</b> still <b>its fat is forbidden,</b> as it is a domesticated animal? The Gemara responds: <b>We require</b> horns that are <b>layered</b> to designate a kosher animal as undomesticated; a goat’s horns are not layered. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t there <b>a bull, which</b> has <b>layered</b> horns, <b>and</b> still <b>its fat is forbidden</b> since it is domesticated? The Gemara responds: <b>We require horns</b> that are <b>grooved;</b> a bull’s horns are not grooved.
The Gemara persists: <b>But</b> isn’t there <b>a goat, which</b> has <b>grooved</b> horns, <b>and</b> still <b>its fat is forbidden?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>We require</b> horns that are <b>branched;</b> a goat’s horns are not branched. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t there <b>a gazelle [<i>tzevi</i>],</b> whose horns <b>are not branched, and</b> still <b>its fat is permitted?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>We require</b> horns that are <b>rounded</b> and not broad like those of a sheep.
The Gemara concludes: <b>Therefore, where</b> an animal’s horns are <b>branched, there is neither judgment nor judge,</b> and the animal is without a doubt undomesticated. <b>Where</b> they are <b>not branched, we require</b> that they be <b>layered, rounded, and grooved. And it</b> must be grooved in a pattern such <b>that its grooves are absorbed</b> into one another.
<b>And this is the uncertainty</b> that arose concerning the <b><i>karkoz</i> goat,</b> i.e., whether it is considered a domesticated animal. As there was <b>a certain <i>karkoz</i> goat that was in the house of the Exilarch, from which</b> they <b>removed a full basket of fat</b> after slaughtering it. <b>Rav Aḥai deemed</b> the fat <b>forbidden,</b> because he considered it a domesticated animal. But <b>Rav Shmuel, son of Rabbi Abbahu, ate of it. He read</b> the verse <b>about himself: “A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth”</b> (Proverbs 18:20). In other words, due to his learning, he knew it was permitted to eat the fat of the <i>karkoz</i> goat.
The Sages <b>sent</b> a message <b>from there,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of</b> Rav <b>Shmuel, son of Rabbi Abbahu,</b> that a <i>karkoz</i> goat is an undomesticated animal and its fat is permitted; <b>but</b> nevertheless, <b>be mindful of</b> the honor of <b>our teacher Aḥai</b> who deems it forbidden, and do not partake of the fat in his presence, <b>as he enlightens the eyes of the exile.</b>
§ The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And</b> with regard to the animal called <b>a <i>keresh</i>, even though it has only one horn,</b> its fat <b>is permitted</b> for consumption. <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> The <b><i>keresh</i></b> is the <b>gazelle</b> that is native to the area <b>of Bei Ila’ei.</b> The <b><i>tagras</i></b> mentioned by the Sages is the <b>lion of Bei Ila’ei. Rav Kahana says: There are nine cubits between the ears of the lion of Bei Ila’ei. Rav Yosef says: The length of the gazelle of Bei Ila’ei is sixteen cubits.</b>
The Gemara recounts: The Roman <b>emperor said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: Your God is compared to a lion, as it is written: “The lion has roared, who will not fear”</b> (Amos 3:8). But if so, <b>what is His greatness? A cavalryman</b> can <b>kill a lion.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him:</b> God <b>is not compared to that lion</b> which a cavalryman can kill. Rather, God is <b>compared to the lion of Bei Ila’ei.</b> The emperor <b>said to him: I ask that you show it to me.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: You cannot see it.</b> The emperor <b>said to him: Truly, I</b> wish to <b>see it.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>prayed for mercy,</b> and the lion of Bei Ila’ei <b>set off from its place</b> of origin toward Rome.
<b>When it was four hundred parasangs away</b> from Rome, <b>it roared once,</b> and <b>all the pregnant women miscarried, and the wall of Rome fell. When it was three hundred parasangs away, it roared another</b> time, and all <b>the men’s front and back teeth fell out</b> from fear. <b>And even he,</b> the emperor, <b>fell from his throne to the ground.</b> The emperor <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>I beg you, pray for mercy with regard to it, that it should go back to the place</b> from which <b>it</b> came. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>prayed for mercy with regard to it, and it returned to the place</b> from which <b>it</b> came.
§ The Gemara recounts: <b>The emperor said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: I wish to see your God.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: You cannot see Him.</b> The emperor <b>said to him: Truly,</b>

Daf 60a

<b>I</b> wish to <b>see Him.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>went and stood</b> the emperor <b>facing the sun in the season of Tammuz,</b> i.e., summer. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: Look at it.</b> The emperor <b>said to him: I cannot.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him:</b> Now, if with regard to <b>the sun, which is</b> only <b>one of the servants that stand before the Holy One, Blessed be He, you say: I cannot look at it,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> with regard to <b>the Divine Presence?</b>
§ The Gemara recounts: <b>The</b> Roman <b>emperor said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: I desire to arrange bread,</b> i.e., a meal, <b>for your God.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: You cannot.</b> The emperor asked him: <b>Why?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: <b>His hosts are too great.</b> The emperor <b>said to him: Truly,</b> I wish to do it. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: Go out and arrange</b> a meal <b>on the shore of the great</b> sea <b>[<i>dirvita</i>], where there is a wide</b> open <b>space.</b> The emperor <b>worked</b> all <b>the six months of summer</b> to accomplish this. <b>A wind came and swept it</b> all <b>into the sea.</b>
The emperor <b>worked</b> to arrange another meal all <b>the six months of winter. Rain came and sank it</b> all <b>in the sea.</b> The emperor <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: <b>What is this?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: These are</b> only the <b>sweepers</b> and floor <b>washers that wait on Him,</b> and they alone have eaten everything. The emperor <b>said to him: If so, I cannot</b> arrange a meal before Him.
§ The Gemara recounts: <b>The daughter of the</b> Roman <b>emperor said to Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: Your God is a carpenter, as it is written: “Who lays the beams of His upper chambers in the waters”</b> (Psalms 104:3). <b>Tell Him to make for me a distaff,</b> a simple tool used in spinning. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya <b>said: Very well. He prayed for mercy for her and she was stricken</b> with leprosy. <b>She sat in the Roman market, and they gave her a distaff, since it was their custom</b> to <b>give a distaff to anyone stricken</b> with leprosy <b>in Rome, and</b> the leper would <b>sit in the market and untangle bunches</b> of wool, <b>so that people would see and pray for mercy on him.</b>
<b>One day</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya <b>was passing there,</b> and he saw that <b>she was sitting and untangling bunches</b> of wool <b>in the Roman market.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya <b>said to her: Is the distaff my God gave you pleasing? She said to him: Tell your God to take</b> back <b>what He has given me.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya <b>said to her: Our God gives,</b> but <b>does not take.</b>
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says: A bull</b> has a large <b>paunch and</b> large <b>hooves. Its head is large, and its tail is large. And the opposite</b> is true <b>for a donkey.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> that results from such a statement? It is relevant <b>for</b> purposes of <b>buying and selling.</b> One who agrees to sell a bull must provide the buyer with one that fits this description, and the opposite for a donkey.
<b>And Rav Yehuda says:</b> The <b>bull that Adam, the first</b> man, <b>sacrificed</b> as a thanks offering for his life being spared <b>had a single horn on its forehead, as it is stated: “And it shall please the Lord better than a bullock that has horns [<i>makrin</i>] and hoofs”</b> (Psalms 69:32). The Gemara comments: On the contrary, the word <b><i>makrin</i> indicates two</b> horns. <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> Although it is vocalized in the plural, <b><i>makran</i> is written</b> in the verse, without the letter <i>yod</i>, to indicate that it had only a single horn.
<b>And Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>the bull that Adam, the first</b> man, <b>sacrificed, its horns preceded its hooves.</b> It was not born of a cow, but rose fully formed out of the earth such that its head emerged first, <b>as it is stated: “And it shall please the Lord better than a bullock that has horns and hoofs.”</b> The phrase <b>“has horns”</b> comes <b>first, and</b> only <b>afterward</b> the word <b>“hoofs.”</b>
And this <b>supports</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: All</b> items created during the <b>acts of Creation were created with their</b> full <b>stature,</b> immediately fit to bear fruit; <b>they were created with their</b> full mental <b>capacities; they were created with their</b> full <b>form. As it is stated: “And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them”</b> (Genesis 2:1). <b>Do not read</b> it as: <b>“The host of them [<i>tzeva’am</i>]”; rather,</b> read it as: <b>Their form [<i>tzivyonam</i>].</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa taught: “May the glory of the Lord endure forever; let the Lord rejoice in His works”</b> (Psalms 104:31). <b>This verse was stated by the minister of the world,</b> i.e., the angel charged with overseeing the world. <b>When the Holy One, Blessed be He, said:</b> “Let the earth put forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit tree bearing fruit <b>after its kind”</b> (Genesis 1:11), <b>the grasses drew an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>with regard to themselves.</b>
They reasoned: <b>If the Holy One, Blessed be He, wishes</b> the <b>mixing</b> of species, <b>why did he say: After its kind, with regard to the trees? And furthermore,</b> let us draw <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> with regard to <b>trees, which do not naturally grow mixed,</b> as they are large and distinct from one another, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: “After its kind,” all the more so</b> with regard to <b>us,</b> since grass naturally grows mixed.
<b>Immediately, every</b> kind of grass <b>emerged after its kind,</b> as it is stated: “And the earth brought forth grass, herb yielding seed after its kind” (Genesis 1:12). <b>The minister of the world began</b> to speak <b>and said: “May the glory of the Lord endure forever; let the Lord rejoice in His works,”</b> who do His will even when not explicitly instructed.
With regard to the above description, <b>Ravina raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>grafted two</b> species of <b>grass onto one another,</b> as is done with trees,

Daf 60b

<b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa?</b> Shall one say that <b>since</b> the phrase <b>“after its kind” is not written</b> as a mitzva <b>with regard to them,</b> one is <b>not liable</b> for transgressing the prohibition against mixing diverse kinds? <b>Or perhaps, since</b> God <b>agreed with them</b> after the fact, as the verse states: “Let the Lord rejoice in His works,” <b>it is as if</b> the mitzva <b>“after its kind” is written with regard to them.</b> The Gemara responds: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi raises a contradiction</b> between two verses. It <b>is written: “And God made the two great lights”</b> (Genesis 1:16), <b>and</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>written</b> in the same verse: <b>“The greater light</b> to rule the day, <b>and the lesser light</b> to rule the night,” indicating that only one was great. Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi explains: When God first created the sun and the moon, they were equally bright. Then, <b>the moon said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe,</b> is it <b>possible for two kings to serve with one crown?</b> One of us must be subservient to the other. God therefore <b>said to her,</b> i.e., the moon: If so, <b>go and diminish yourself.</b>
<b>She said before Him: Master of the Universe, since I said a correct</b> observation <b>before You,</b> must <b>I diminish myself?</b> God <b>said to her:</b> As compensation, <b>go and rule</b> both <b>during the day</b> along with the sun <b>and during the night. She said to Him: What is the greatness of</b> shining alongside the sun? <b>What use is a candle in the middle of the day?</b> God <b>said to her: Go; let the Jewish people count the days and years with you,</b> and this will be your greatness. <b>She said to Him: But</b> the Jewish people will count with <b>the sun as well,</b> as <b>it is impossible that they will not count seasons with it, as it is written: “And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years”</b> (Genesis 1:14). God said to her: <b>Go; let righteous men be named after you.</b> Just as you are called the lesser [<i>hakatan</i>] light, there will be <b>Ya’akov HaKatan,</b> i.e., Jacob our forefather (see Amos 7:2), <b>Shmuel HaKatan</b> the <i>tanna</i>, and <b>David HaKatan,</b> i.e., King David (see I Samuel 17:14).
God <b>saw that</b> the moon <b>was not comforted. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Bring atonement for me, since I diminished the moon.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>And this is what Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: What is different</b> about the <b>goat</b> offering <b>of</b> the <b>New Moon, that</b> it <b>is stated with regard to it: “For the Lord”</b> (Numbers 28:15)? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: This goat shall be an atonement</b> for Me <b>for having diminished</b> the size of <b>the moon.</b>
§ <b>Rav Asi raises a contradiction</b> between two verses. It <b>is written: “And the earth brought forth grass”</b> (Genesis 1:12), <b>on the third day of the week</b> of Creation. <b>And</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>written: “No shrub of the field was yet in the earth”</b> (Genesis 2:5), <b>on Shabbat eve,</b> the sixth day of Creation, immediately before Adam was created. Rav Asi explains: This <b>teaches that the grasses emerged</b> on the third day <b>and stood at the opening of the ground,</b> but they did not grow <b>until Adam, the first</b> man, <b>came and prayed for mercy upon them, and rain came, and they sprouted.</b> And this is meant <b>to teach you that the Holy One, Blessed be He, desires the prayers of the righteous.</b>
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rav Naḥman bar Pappa had a certain garden. He planted seeds but they did not sprout. He prayed for mercy,</b> and <b>rain came, and</b> they <b>sprouted. He said: This is</b> what is meant by the statement <b>of Rav Asi,</b> that the Holy One, Blessed be He, desires the prayers of the righteous.
§ In one of the passages discussing kosher and non-kosher animals, the Torah states: “Nevertheless, these you shall not eat of them that only chew the cud, or of them that have split hooves that are cloven [<i>hashesua</i>]: The camel, and the hare, and the hyrax” (Deuteronomy 14:7). <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said: “<i>Hashesua</i>”</b> is not a redundant description of the split hooves but <b>a distinct creature, which has two backs and two spines</b> and therefore looks like an entirely cloven animal. One might ask: <b>But was Moses our teacher a hunter, or was he an archer,</b> who was familiar with the most exotic animals? Rather, <b>from here</b> there is <b>a refutation to those who say that the Torah is not from Heaven,</b> since Moses could not have known of the existence of such an animal save by divine revelation.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Taḥlifa bar Avina: Go write</b> this statement about the <b>hunter [<i>kinnigi</i>] and</b> the <b>archer [<i>ballisteri</i>] in your</b> book of <b><i>aggada</i>, and explain</b> those two words, since some are unfamiliar with them.
The Gemara relates another statement. The verse states: <b>“The five lords of the Philistines: The Gazite, and the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, and the Ekronite; also the Avvim”</b> (Joshua 13:3). The verse is difficult, since it first <b>said</b> there are <b>five</b> lords of the Philistines, <b>but it</b> then <b>lists six. Rabbi Yonatan said:</b> There were in fact six lords, but <b>the greatest of them</b> were only <b>five. Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Taḥlifa bar Avina: Write</b> this statement about <b>the greatest [<i>arunekei</i>] in your</b> book of <b><i>aggada</i>, and explain</b> that word. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this statement <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion <b>of Rav, as Rav says:</b> The <b>Avvim</b> were not Philistines; rather, they <b>came from Teiman.</b>
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>Avvim came from Teiman. And why were they called Avvim</b> and not Teimanim? <b>Because they corrupted [<i>ivvetu</i>]</b> and destroyed <b>their place</b> of origin when they left. <b>Alternatively,</b> they were called <b>Avvim since they desired [<i>ivvu</i>] many deities. Alternatively,</b> they were called <b>Avvim since</b> they were so fearsome that <b>all who saw them were seized by convulsions [<i>avit</i>]. Rav Yosef said: And each one of them has sixteen rows of teeth.</b>
The Gemara cites another statement related to the Avvim: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> There are <b>many verses that</b> are seemingly <b>fit to be burned as books of the heretics,</b> since they appear redundant or frivolous, <b>and</b> yet <b>they are themselves the essence of Torah.</b> For example, the verse states: <b>“And the Avvim, that dwelt in villages as far as Gaza,</b> the Caphtorim, that came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead” (Deuteronomy 2:23). <b>What</b> practical <b>difference</b> does this make <b>for us?</b>
The verse teaches the following: <b>Since Abimelech,</b> king of the Philistines, <b>administered an oath to Abraham: “That you will not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my grandson”</b> (Genesis 21:23), the Jewish people were prohibited from conquering the land of the Philistines until four generations had passed. Therefore, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let</b> the <b>Caphtorim come</b> and <b>remove</b> the land <b>from</b> the <b>Avvim, who are</b> the same as the <b>Philistines, and let Israel come</b> and <b>remove</b> it <b>from the Caphtorim,</b> circumventing the prohibition.
<b>Similarly, you say</b> with regard to another apparently unnecessary verse, describing a city that the Israelites conquered: <b>“For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the</b> former <b>king of Moab,</b> and taken all his land out of his hand” (Numbers 21:26). <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> in knowing this information? It teaches <b>that</b> since <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Israel: “Be not at enmity with Moab”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:9), the Jewish people were prohibited from conquering the land of Moab. Therefore, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let Sihon come</b> and <b>remove</b> the land <b>from Moab, and let Israel come</b> and <b>remove</b> it <b>from Sihon.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>And this is what Rav Pappa says:</b> The lands of <b>Ammon and Moab were purified by Sihon,</b> i.e., rendered permitted for conquest.
The Gemara cites another seemingly superfluous verse, describing Mount Hermon: <b>“Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion,</b> and the Amorites call it Senir” (Deuteronomy 3:9). A Sage <b>taught: Senir and Sirion are mountains of Eretz Yisrael.</b> The verse <b>teaches that every one of the nations of the world went and built itself a great city</b> on Mount Hermon, <b>and named it after</b> one of <b>the mountains of Eretz Yisrael, teaching you that even the mountains of Eretz Yisrael are beloved by the nations of the world.</b>
<b>Similarly,</b> a difficult verse describes Joseph’s treatment of the Egyptians: <b>“And as for the people, he removed them city by city”</b> (Genesis 47:21). <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> of this information? It teaches Joseph’s love for his brothers, as he transferred the entire Egyptian population <b>so that they would not call his brothers exiles.</b>
§ The mishna states: <b>The signs of the</b> kosher <b>bird were not</b> explicitly <b>stated</b> in the Torah. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it true that they were <b>not</b> stated in the Torah? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“The <i>nesher</i>”</b> (Leviticus 11:13) is a non-kosher bird.

Daf 61a

<b>Just as a <i>nesher</i></b> is <b>unique</b> in <b>that it has no extra digit or crop, and its gizzard cannot be peeled, and it claws</b> its prey <b>and eats</b> it, and it is <b>non-kosher, so too, all like</b> birds with these four signs are <b>non-kosher.</b> And just as <b>doves</b> and pigeons, <b>which have an extra digit and a crop, and whose gizzard can be peeled, and do not claw</b> their food <b>and eat</b> it, are <b>kosher,</b> as they are fit for sacrifice on the altar (see Leviticus 1:14), <b>so too, all like</b> birds with these four signs are <b>kosher.</b> If so, why does the mishna state that the signs were not stated in the Torah? <b>Abaye said:</b> The mishna means that <b>the explanation of</b> the signs of a kosher bird <b>was not stated in the Torah. Rather,</b> one learns it <b>from the statements of the Sages,</b> i.e., the <i>baraita</i>.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches: A bird that comes</b> before a person <b>with one sign</b> of a kosher bird, and which is not listed in the Torah as non-kosher, <b>is kosher, since it is unlike a <i>nesher</i>.</b> The verse did not need to state that the <i>nesher</i> is non-kosher, since one could have inferred this from the list of other non-kosher birds. Rather, the verse mentions the <i>nesher</i> specifically to indicate that <b>it is</b> only a bird like <b>a <i>nesher</i>, which has none</b> of the signs of a kosher bird, <b>that you shall not eat. But</b> if <b>there is</b> a bird <b>that has</b> even <b>one</b> of the signs, <b>you may eat</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why learn specifically from the case of a <i>nesher</i>? <b>Let one derive</b> the opposite <b>from</b> the case of <b>doves: Just as doves, which</b> the Torah mentions explicitly as kosher, <b>have all four</b> signs, <b>so too here,</b> no other bird is kosher <b>unless it has all four</b> signs.
The Gemara responds: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that one learns from the case of a dove, <b>why do I</b> need <b>the rest of the non-kosher birds that the Merciful One wrote?</b> Since none of them has all four signs of a kosher bird, their non-kosher status could simply be inferred from the case of a dove. Rather, since the Torah states explicitly that they are non-kosher, it follows that one does not learn from the case of a dove.
The Gemara objects: <b>But let us derive</b> instead <b>from them,</b> i.e., the rest of the non-kosher birds, which each have only three signs, the following: <b>Just as there,</b> those birds have <b>three</b> of the signs of a kosher bird mentioned in the mishna, <b>and we</b> still <b>do not eat</b> them, <b>so too, all</b> other birds that have <b>three signs</b> should have the same halakhic status, <b>and we will not eat</b> them. <b>And all the more so</b> should this apply to a bird that has only <b>two</b> signs <b>or one.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>If so, why do I</b> need <b>the crow that the Merciful One wrote</b> among the non-kosher birds? <b>Now</b> that it is established <b>that we do not eat</b> any bird <b>that has three</b> signs, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to mention the crow, <b>which has</b> only <b>two?</b> Rather, those birds explicitly listed as non-kosher are prohibited, and all other birds with any number of signs are kosher.

Daf 61b

The Gemara objects: <b>But one should derive</b> instead <b>from a crow: Just as there,</b> a bird with <b>two</b> signs is <b>not</b> kosher, <b>so too any</b> other bird that has only <b>two</b> signs is <b>not</b> kosher. The Gemara responds: <b>If so, why do I</b> need the <b><i>peres</i> and</b> the <b><i>ozniyya</i> that the Merciful One wrote</b> among the non-kosher birds? <b>Now</b> that it is established <b>that we do not eat</b> any bird <b>that has two</b> signs, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to mention these birds, <b>which have</b> only <b>one?</b> Rather, even birds that have only one sign are kosher, save those mentioned explicitly in the Torah as non-kosher.
The Gemara objects: <b>But let us learn</b> instead <b>from</b> the <b><i>peres</i> and <i>ozniyya</i></b> themselves that all other birds with only one sign are non-kosher. The Gemara responds: <b>If so, why do I</b> need the <b><i>nesher</i> that the Merciful One wrote? Now</b> that it is established <b>that we do not eat</b> any bird <b>that has one</b> sign, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to mention the <i>nesher</i>, <b>which has none? Rather,</b> the Torah mentions the <i>nesher</i> to indicate that <b>it is a <i>nesher</i>, which has none</b> of the signs of a kosher bird, <b>that you shall not eat. But</b> if you find any bird <b>that has</b> even <b>one</b> of the signs, you may <b>eat</b> it.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> if so, <b>the reason</b> for eating birds with even one sign is only <b>that the Merciful One wrote: “<i>Nesher</i>.”</b> One can infer, <b>then,</b> that if <b>not</b> for <b>this, I would say: Derive from</b> the <b><i>peres</i> and <i>ozniyya</i></b> that any bird with one sign is non-kosher. But that cannot be, since the <b><i>peres</i> and <i>ozniyya</i> are two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., that teach the same matter, <b>and</b> as a rule, <b>two verses that come as one do not teach</b> a principle.
The Gemara responds: <b>It is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that</b> the sign <b>present in this,</b> the <i>peres</i>, <b>is absent in that,</b> the <i>ozniyya</i>, <b>and that</b> which is <b>present in that is absent in this.</b> Accordingly, this is not a case of two verses that come as one, since each case would teach only that any other bird with only its respective sign is non-kosher. Consequently, it would have been possible to derive from them that any bird with only one sign is non-kosher. The verse therefore states: “<i>Nesher</i>,” to indicate otherwise.
The Gemara persists: <b>Now, there are twenty-four non-kosher birds</b> mentioned in the verses. <b>It is impossible that</b> the <b>one</b> sign <b>present in these,</b> the <i>peres</i> and <i>ozniyya</i>, respectively, <b>is absent in</b> all <b>those</b> other birds. Consequently, the mentioning of the <i>peres</i>, <i>ozniyya</i>, and the other birds <b>constitutes two verses that come as one.</b> If so, one could not have derived from the cases of the <i>peres</i> and <i>ozniyya</i> that a bird with one sign is not kosher, and the inclusion of the <i>nesher</i> is unnecessary.
The Gemara responds: <b>It is learned</b> as a tradition that <b>there are twenty-four non-kosher birds, and four signs</b> of a kosher bird. The same <b>three</b> signs <b>can be found in all of them,</b> with the exception of either the <i>peres</i> or the <i>ozniyya</i>. <b>Twenty of them</b> have all <b>three</b> signs, <b>and two</b> of those signs can be found <b>in a crow. One</b> sign is found <b>in a <i>peres</i> and one in an <i>ozniyya</i>,</b> and the sign <b>present in this is absent in that,</b> i.e., one of them has the fourth sign, which is absent from the other twenty-three non-kosher birds. <b>Lest you say: Derive from it</b> that any other bird with only that sign is non-kosher, <b>the Merciful One wrote</b> about the <b><i>nesher</i></b> to indicate: <b>It is a <i>nesher</i>, which has none</b> of the signs of a kosher bird, <b>that you shall not eat. But</b> if <b>there is</b> any bird <b>that has</b> even <b>one</b> of the signs, you may <b>eat</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if one learns from <i>nesher</i> that a bird with even one sign is kosher, <b>why do I</b> need the <b>doves that the Merciful One wrote</b> are kosher, which have all four? <b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said:</b> The dove was not mentioned to teach that it is kosher, but rather <b>to</b> teach that it is the only bird fit to be sacrificed as <b>an offering. Rav Naḥman says:</b>

Daf 62a

If <b>one is familiar with</b> the non-kosher birds <b>and their names,</b> any <b>bird that comes</b> before him <b>with</b> only <b>one sign is kosher,</b> since he can be sure that it is not the <i>peres</i> or <i>ozniyya</i>, which have only one sign. If <b>he is not familiar with them and their names,</b> any bird that he finds <b>with one sign is non-kosher,</b> since it may be the <i>peres</i> or <i>ozniyya</i>. But if he finds a bird <b>with</b> exactly <b>two signs,</b> it is <b>kosher, provided that he</b> can <b>recognize a crow,</b> since the crow is the only non-kosher bird with exactly two signs.
The Gemara asks: Must he recognize only the <b>crow and nothing more? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Every <i>orev</i> after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:15). With regard to the <b><i>orev</i>, this is the</b> well-known <b>crow;</b> as for the phrase <b>“after its kinds,” Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It is written <b>to include the <i>zarzir</i>,</b> another type of crow, to teach that it is non-kosher. The Sages <b>said to Rabbi Eliezer: But wouldn’t the people of Kefar Temarta in Judea eat</b> the <i>zarzir</i>, <b>because it has a crop?</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: They too will be judged in the future</b> for their transgression.
<b>Alternatively,</b> the phrase <b>“after its kinds”</b> is written <b>to include</b> the <b>white <i>senunit</i></b> and teach that it is non-kosher; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him: But don’t the people of the upper Galilee eat it, because its gizzard can be peeled?</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to them: They too will be judged in the future</b> for their transgression. In any event, the <i>baraita</i> indicates that other non-kosher birds exist that have two signs, like the crow. The Gemara responds: <b>Rather,</b> Rav Naḥman must have meant that one must be able to recognize the well-known <b>crow and all</b> other <b>species of crow.</b>
<b>Ameimar said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is: Any <b>bird that comes</b> before a person <b>with one sign is kosher, provided that it does not claw</b> its food. <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: What</b> about <b>that which Rav Naḥman</b> said, that if one finds a bird with exactly one sign, he may eat it only if he can identify all the non-kosher birds in the Torah, to be sure that it is not one of them? Ameimar <b>said to him: I did not hear</b> this statement; <b>that is to say: I do not hold</b> accordingly. <b>What</b> concern <b>is there?</b> Is one concerned <b>because</b> of <b>the <i>peres</i> and <i>ozniyya</i>,</b> which have only one sign? <b>They are not</b> found <b>in settled areas,</b> and one need not be concerned about them.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> The bird known as <b>the scratching bird is fit for</b> use in <b>the purification of a leper,</b> i.e., it is kosher. Only kosher birds are fit for this rite, as the verse states: “Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be purified two living pure birds” (Leviticus 14:4). <b>And this is the white <i>senunit</i> about which Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis disagreed</b> in the <i>baraita</i>.
<b>Ameimar said:</b> There are two kinds of white <i>senunit</i>. <b>With regard to</b> the <i>senunit</i> <b>with a white belly, everyone agrees that it is permitted</b> for consumption. <b>They disagree when</b> discussing the kind <b>with a yellow belly. Rabbi Eliezer prohibits it, and the Rabbis permit it. And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
<b>Mar Zutra teaches</b> the statement of Ameimar in <b>this</b> manner: <b>With regard to</b> the <i>senunit</i> <b>with a yellow belly, everyone agrees that it is prohibited. They disagree when</b> discussing the kind <b>with a white belly. Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> it <b>prohibited, and the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>permitted. And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who deem</b> it <b>permitted.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the kind <b>with a white belly, this</b> explanation is consistent with <b>that which</b> Rav Yehuda <b>teaches: This is the white <i>senunit</i></b> about which Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis disagreed. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the kind <b>with a yellow</b> belly, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>This is the white <i>senunit</i>?</b> The Gemara responds: The phrase: White <i>senunit</i>, is used only <b>to exclude</b> the <b>house</b> <i>senunit</i>, <b>which is black.</b>
§ <b>Raḥava says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> A young <b><i>tasil</i>,</b> which is similar to a dove, is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice <b>as a dove,</b> which is fit only when mature, <b>but</b> it is <b>fit</b> for sacrifice <b>as a pigeon,</b> which is fit only when immature. In other words, the <i>tasil</i> is considered a type of pigeon, not a dove. A mature <b><i>datzifi</i></b> bird, <b>and</b> mature <b>doves of Reḥava, are fit as doves, but are unfit as pigeons,</b> since they are types of doves. <b>Rav Daniel bar Rav Ketina raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Para</i> 9:3): <b>All birds</b>

Daf 62b

<b>disqualify</b> the <b>water of purification,</b> i.e., water in which ashes of the red heifer have been placed, by drinking from it. The water that entered the bird’s mouth is disqualified, and some of it drips back into the container, disqualifying the rest. This applies to all birds <b>except for the pigeon, because it sips</b> the water from the container and none falls back in from its mouth. <b>But if it is so</b> that the <i>tasil</i> is a type of pigeon, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach: Except for</b> the <b>pigeon and</b> the <b><i>tasil</i>. Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Although the <i>tasil</i> is a type of pigeon and sips the water as well, <b>this,</b> the <i>tasil</i>, <b>sips</b> the water <b>and spits</b> part of it back, and therefore disqualifies the water of purification, <b>and that,</b> the pigeon, <b>sips but does not spit.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda says: The <i>tzutzeyanei</i> doves are fit for</b> sacrifice <b>on the altar, and they are the doves of Reḥava</b> mentioned earlier. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 14:6): The Torah requires hyssop for the purification of a leper. It must be standard <b>hyssop, and neither a hyssop of Greece, nor stibium hyssop, nor Roman hyssop, nor desert</b> hyssop, <b>nor any</b> other kind of <b>hyssop whose</b> name is accompanied by <b>a modifier.</b> Likewise, <i>tzutzeyanei</i> doves should be unfit for sacrifice, because they have a modifier in their name.
<b>Abaye said: Any</b> item <b>whose name was modified before the giving of the Torah, and</b> concerning which <b>the Torah was particular</b> when naming <b>it, is unfit</b> if <b>its</b> name is accompanied by <b>a modifier,</b> since the language of the Torah was formulated to exclude it. <b>But the name of these</b> <i>tzutzeyanei</i> doves <b>was not modified,</b> i.e., the modifier <i>tzutzeyanei</i> was not applied to them, <b>before the giving of the Torah.</b> Even though it was applied to them later, they are still fit for sacrifice. Alternatively, <b>Rava said: The <i>tzutzeyanei</i> doves are called simply</b> doves <b>in their place</b> of habitation.
Similarly, <b>Rav Yehuda says: These grasshoppers</b> found <b>among the shrubs</b> are kosher and <b>permitted</b> for consumption. <b>And</b> those found <b>among the cabbages are forbidden. Ravina said: And we flog</b> those who eat them <b>on their account, due to</b> the prohibition: “And all <b>winged swarming things</b> are impure unto you” (Deuteronomy 14:19). <b>And Rav Yehuda says:</b> The bird called <b><i>tzarda</i> is permitted</b> for consumption, <b>and</b> the <b><i>barda</i> is prohibited. And your mnemonic</b> to remember which is which is this: Eat any bird <b>except [<i>bar</i>] for it.</b> As for <b>the <i>marda</i>, it is uncertain</b> whether it is kosher.
<b>Rav Asi says: There are eight uncertain</b> cases: The <b><i>ḥuva</i>, <i>ḥuga</i>, <i>suga</i>, and <i>harnuga</i>, <i>tushelemi</i>, and <i>marda</i>, <i>kuḥilna</i>, and <i>bar nappaḥa</i>.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is their uncertainty? The gizzard of kosher birds can be peeled,</b> as mentioned in the mishna, <b>and the gizzard of non-kosher</b> birds <b>cannot be peeled, but the gizzard of these</b> birds <b>can be peeled</b> only <b>with a knife.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why should these not be kosher? Wasn’t there <b>a certain duck in the house of Mar Shmuel whose gizzard could not be peeled, and they set</b> the gizzard <b>in the sun, and once it softened it could be peeled?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>There, when it softened it could be peeled by hand. Here,</b> in these eight cases, <b>even when it softened it could be peeled only with a knife.</b>
<b>Abaye says: The swamp rooster is one of the eight uncertain</b> cases, <b>and this is</b> the <b><i>mardu</i>,</b> i.e., the <i>marda</i> mentioned earlier. <b>Rav Pappa says: The swamp rooster is forbidden, but the swamphen is permitted. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the statement of the Sages with regard to the verse: “An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 23:4), that <b>an Ammonite man</b> is unfit to enter the assembly, <b>but not an Ammonite woman. Mareimar taught: The swamphen is forbidden,</b> because the Sages <b>saw that it claws</b> its prey <b>and eats</b> it. <b>And this is</b> the <b><i>giruta</i>,</b> a non-kosher bird (see 109b).
<b>Rav says:</b> The bird called the <b><i>shavor anderafta</i> is permitted,</b> but the <b><i>piruz anderafta</i> is forbidden. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the known personality <b>Piruz the Evil. Rav Huna says:</b> The bird called the <b><i>bunya</i> is permitted.</b> The <b><i>parva</i> is forbidden. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the known personality <b>Parva’a the Sorcerer.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The bird known as the <b>reclining and eating <i>mardu</i> is permitted,</b> while the <b>bowing and eating</b> <i>mardu</i> <b>is forbidden. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the verse: <b>“You shall bow down to no other god”</b> (Exodus 34:14). <b>Shmuel says:</b> The bird called the <b>wine drinker is forbidden. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the <i>halakha</i>: <b>Those who drank wine are unfit for service</b> in the Temple. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> The bird called the <b>wine pourer is forbidden.</b>

Daf 63a

But the bird called the <b>little wine pourer is permitted. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the idiom of the Sages: <b>The power of the son is greater than the power of the father,</b> i.e., the larger is forbidden while the smaller is permitted.
<b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> There are several types of <b><i>shekitena</i>.</b> The <b>long-shanked red</b> ones are <b>permitted. And your mnemonic</b> to remember this is the <b><i>murzema</i></b> bird, which is similar in appearance and known to be kosher. The <b>little red</b> ones are <b>forbidden, and your mnemonic</b> for this is the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a dwarf</b> priest is <b>unfit</b> for Temple service. The <b>long-shanked green,</b> i.e., yellow, ones are <b>forbidden, and your mnemonic</b> for this is the mishna (56a): Innards that have turned <b>green</b> render an animal a <i>tereifa</i> and <b>unfit</b> for consumption.
<b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> As for the <b><i>shalakh</i>,</b> listed as a non-kosher bird (see Leviticus 11:17), <b>this is</b> the bird <b>that scoops [<i>sholeh</i>] fish out of the sea.</b> The <b><i>dukhifat</i></b> (see Leviticus 11:19) is the bird <b>whose comb</b> seems <b>bent [<i>hodo kafut</i>]</b> due to its thickness. The Gemara notes: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b><i>dukhifat</i></b> is the bird <b>whose comb</b> seems <b>bent, and this is</b> the bird <b>that brought the <i>shamir</i> to the Temple.</b> As recounted in tractate <i>Gittin</i> (68b), King Solomon required a unique worm called the <i>shamir</i> to carve stones of the Temple, as the verse states: “There was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building” (I Kings 6:7).
The Gemara recounts: <b>When Rabbi Yoḥanan would see a <i>shalakh</i>, he</b> would <b>say: “Your judgments are like the great deep”</b> (Psalms 36:7), as God exacts retribution even upon the fish in the sea. <b>When he would see an ant, he</b> would <b>say</b> the first half of the same verse: <b>“Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains,”</b> as God provides sustenance for the tiny ant just as He does for the largest creatures.
<b>Ameimar says:</b> The <b><i>laknei</i> and <i>batnei</i></b> birds are <b>permitted.</b> As for the <b><i>sakna’ei</i> and <i>batna’ei</i></b> birds, in any <b>place that it is customary to eat</b> them, <b>one may eat</b> them; in any <b>place that it is customary not to eat</b> them, <b>one may not eat</b> them. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that the matter</b> of whether it is permitted <b>depends on custom?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Yes, but</b> it is <b>not difficult: This</b> place where they are forbidden is <b>a place where the <i>peres</i> and <i>ozniyya</i> are found.</b> Since they are similar to these birds, one must be concerned that people will confuse them, even though the <i>sakna’ei</i> and <i>batna’ei</i> are themselves kosher. <b>That</b> place where they are permitted is <b>a place where the <i>peres</i> and <i>ozniyya</i> are not found.</b>
<b>Abaye says:</b> The birds called <b><i>kevai</i> and <i>kakvai</i> are forbidden,</b> but the <b><i>kakvata</i> is permitted.</b> Still, <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they flog</b> one who eats it <b>on its</b> account, <b>and they call it <i>taḥveta</i>.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b><i>tinshemet</i>,</b> listed in the Torah as non-kosher (see Leviticus 11:18), is the <b><i>ba’ut</i> among birds.</b> One might ask: <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>the <i>ba’ut</i> among birds, or is it only the <i>ba’ut</i> among creeping animals?</b> The <i>tinshemet</i> is also listed among the creeping animals (see Leviticus 11:30). <b>Say: Go out and learn from the thirteen hermeneutical principles,</b> of which one is: <b>A matter derived from its context. What are the</b> adjacent <b>verses speaking about?</b> They are speaking <b>about birds. So too here,</b> the word <i>tinshemet</i> is referring <b>to birds.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>It is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in this way with regard to</b> the <i>tinshemet</i> listed among the <b>creeping animals:</b> The <b><i>tinshemet</i></b> here is the <b><i>ba’ut</i> among creeping animals.</b> One might ask: <b>Do you say</b> that it is the <b><i>ba’ut</i> among creeping animals, or it is only</b> the <b><i>ba’ut</i> among birds? Say: Go out and learn from the thirteen hermeneutical principles,</b> of which one is: <b>A matter derived from its context. What are the</b> adjacent <b>verses speaking about?</b> They are speaking <b>about creeping animals. So too here,</b> the word <i>tinshemet</i> is referring <b>to creeping animals.</b>
<b>Abaye says:</b> The <b><i>ba’ut</i> among birds</b> is commonly called the <b><i>kifof</i>.</b> The <b><i>ba’ut</i> among creeping animals</b> is commonly called the <b><i>kurpedai</i>. Rav Yehuda says:</b> As for the <b><i>ka’at</i></b> listed in the Torah as non-kosher (see Leviticus 11:18), <b>this is the</b> bird called <b>a <i>kuk</i>.</b> As for the <b><i>raḥam</i>, this is</b> the <b><i>sherakrak</i>.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Why is it called the <i>raḥam</i>?</b> Because <b>when the <i>raḥam</i> comes</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>mercy [<i>raḥamim</i>] comes to the world,</b> as it appears at the beginning of the rainy season. <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said: And it is</b> a sign of rain only <b>when it sits on something and makes a <i>sherakrak</i></b> sound. And it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that if it sits on the ground and hisses [<i>veshareik</i>],</b> this is a sign that <b>the Messiah is coming, as it is stated: “I will hiss [<i>eshreka</i>] for them, and gather them”</b> (Zechariah 10:8).
<b>Rav Adda bar Shimi said to Mar bar Rav Idai: But</b> wasn’t there <b>a certain</b> <i>raḥam</i> <b>that sat on a plowed field and hissed, and a stone came and broke its head?</b> Mar bar Rav Idai <b>said to him: That</b> <i>raḥam</i> <b>was a liar</b> and was punished for prophesying falsely.
With regard to the verse: “Every <i>orev</i> after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:15), <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: As for the <b><i>orev</i>, this is the crow.</b> When the verse states: <b>“Every <i>orev</i>,”</b> this serves <b>to include the valley crow</b> as non-kosher. And the verse states: <b>“After its kinds,” to include the crow that comes at the heads of pigeons.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>The Master said:</b> As for the <b><i>orev</i>, this is the crow. Is that to say</b> that the particular crow <b>stands before us,</b> such that one immediately knows which one it is? <b>Rather, say:</b> As for the <b><i>orev</i>, this is the black crow, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “His locks are curled, and black as a crow”</b> (Song of Songs 5:11). The Gemara continues to explain the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The valley</b> crow <b>[<i>ha’amaki</i>]</b> is the <b>white</b> crow. <b>And so</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to leprosy: <b>“If the appearance thereof be deeper [<i>amok</i>] than the skin”</b> (Leviticus 13:30), and the Sages explained: <b>As the appearance of</b> an area lit by the <b>sun, which</b> seems <b>deeper than the shade,</b> which appears to cover it. There is therefore an association between a valley and the color white.
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>the crow that comes at the heads of pigeons, Rav Pappa said: Do not say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means <b>that it comes at the head of pigeons,</b> i.e., it dwells with them; <b>rather,</b> it means that this crow’s <b>head resembles that of a pigeon.</b>
With regard to the verse: “And the <i>netz</i> after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:16), <b>the Sages taught:</b> As for <b>the <i>netz</i>, this is the hawk.</b> The verse states: <b>“After its kinds,” to include</b> the bird called <b><i>bar ḥireya</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the <i>bar ḥireya</i>? Abaye said:</b> It is the bird commonly called the <b><i>shurineka</i>.</b>
With regard to the verse: “And the <i>ḥasida</i>, and the <i>anafa</i> after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:19), <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> As for <b>the <i>ḥasida</i>, this is the white <i>dayya</i>. And why is it called <i>ḥasida</i>? Since it performs charity [<i>ḥasidut</i>] for its fellows,</b> giving them from its own food. As for <b>the <i>anafa</i>, this is the irritable <i>dayya</i>. And why is it called <i>anafa</i>? Since it quarrels [<i>mena’efet</i>] with its fellows.</b>
§ <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥanan, son of Rava, says</b> that <b>Rav says: There are twenty-four non-kosher birds. Rav Ḥanan bar Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Ḥisda,</b> his father: <b>From where</b> in the Torah is this number obtained? <b>If</b> you are referring to the list <b>of Leviticus</b> (11:13–19), <b>there are</b> only <b>twenty</b> birds listed there. <b>If</b> you are referring to the list <b>of Deuteronomy</b> (14:12–18), <b>there are</b> only <b>twenty-one</b> there. <b>And if you would say: Add</b> the <b><i>da’a</i>, which is written in Leviticus but is not written in Deuteronomy, to</b> the others in Deuteronomy, <b>still there are</b> only <b>twenty-two.</b>
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: This</b> is what <b>your mother’s father,</b> Rav Ḥanan, son of Rava, <b>said in the name of Rav:</b> The phrases <b>“after its kinds,” “after its kinds,” “after its kinds,”</b> and <b>“after its kinds,”</b> that appear in each list indicate additional cases. <b>Here,</b> then, <b>are four</b> more. The Gemara objects: <b>If so, there are twenty-six,</b> not twenty-four. <b>Abaye said:</b> The <b><i>da’a</i></b> mentioned in Leviticus <b>and</b> the <b><i>ra’a</i></b> mentioned in Deuteronomy <b>are one</b> bird. <b>As, if it enters your mind that they are two</b> different birds,

Daf 63b

one might ask: <b>Since</b> it is assumed that the list in <b>Deuteronomy comes to add</b> to the list in Leviticus, <b>what is different here,</b> in Leviticus, <b>that it is written: “<i>Da’a</i>,”</b> and <b>what is different here,</b> in Deuteronomy, <b>that it is written: “<i>Ra’a</i>,” and <i>da’a</i> is not written? Rather, conclude from</b> the presence of each on only one list that the <b><i>ra’a</i> and <i>da’a</i> are one species.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But still, there are twenty-five</b> birds, not twenty-four. <b>Abaye said: Just as</b> the <b><i>ra’a</i> and <i>da’a</i> are one</b> species, <b>so</b> too, the <b><i>ayya</i> and</b> the <b><i>dayya</i>,</b> the latter of which is mentioned only in Deuteronomy, <b>are one</b> species. <b>As, if it enters your mind that they are two</b> different species, one might ask: <b>Since</b> it is assumed that the list in <b>Deuteronomy comes to add</b> to the list in Leviticus, <b>what is different here,</b> in Leviticus, <b>that it is written: “After its kinds,” about</b> the <b><i>ayya</i>,</b> prohibiting some other kind of <i>ayya</i>, <b>and what is different there,</b> in Deuteronomy, <b>that it is written: “After its kinds,” about</b> the <b><i>dayya</i>?</b> Why is the <i>ayya</i> not mentioned? <b>Rather, learn from</b> the use of the same phrase with regard to the <b><i>ayya</i> and <i>dayya</i></b> that they <b>are one</b> species.
The Gemara asks: <b>And now that</b> the <b><i>ayya</i> and <i>dayya</i> are one</b> species, <b>why did</b> the Torah need <b>to write</b> both <b><i>ayya</i> and <i>dayya</i></b> in Deuteronomy? The Gemara responds: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> Given that the two are one species, <b>I will read <i>ayya</i></b> and know that it is forbidden. <b>Why is <i>dayya</i> stated?</b> It is <b>so as not to give a claim to a litigant to disagree,</b> and <b>it should not occur</b> that <b>you call</b> it <b>an <i>ayya</i> and he calls</b> it <b>a <i>dayya</i></b> and eats it. Likewise, the Torah did not write only <i>dayya</i> so that it will not occur that <b>you call</b> it <b>a <i>dayya</i> and he calls</b> it <b>an <i>ayya</i></b> and eats it. <b>Therefore,</b> the Torah <b>writes in Deuteronomy: “And the <i>ra’a</i>, and the <i>ayya</i>, and the <i>dayya</i> after its kinds”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:13). Consequently, both the list in Leviticus and that in Deuteronomy enumerate twenty-four birds, in accordance with the statement attributed to Rav.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> is the list <b>of</b> non-kosher <b>animals</b> in Leviticus <b>repeated?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the necessity of adding <b>the <i>shesua</i></b> (Deuteronomy 14:7), which was not listed in Leviticus. <b>And</b> the list <b>of</b> non-kosher <b>birds</b> is repeated <b>due to the <i>ra’a</i>. What, is it not</b> understood <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the extra list of <b>animals there,</b> in Deuteronomy, is <b>to add</b> animals, that the list of <b>birds</b> is <b>also</b> repeated <b>to add</b> birds? The Gemara responds: <b>No, there,</b> i.e., with regard to animals, the list is repeated <b>to add,</b> but <b>here,</b> with regard to birds, it is repeated only <b>to explain.</b>
<b>And</b> the opinion that the <i>da’a</i> and <i>ra’a</i> are one species, and that the <i>ayya</i> and <i>dayya</i> are another species, <b>differs from</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> The <b><i>ra’a</i> is</b> the <b><i>ayya</i>. And why is it called</b> the <b><i>ra’a</i>? Since it sees [<i>ro’ah</i>] most</b> vividly. <b>And so</b> the verse <b>states: “That path no bird of prey knows, neither has the eye of the <i>ayya</i> seen it”</b> (Job 28:7). And a Sage <b>taught:</b> The <i>ra’a</i> can <b>stand in Babylonia and see a carcass in Eretz Yisrael.</b>
The Gemara discusses Rabbi Abbahu’s statement: <b>Since</b> the <b><i>ra’a</i> is</b> the same as the <b><i>ayya</i>, by inference,</b> one may conclude <b>that</b> the <b><i>da’a</i> is not the</b> same as the <b><i>ra’a</i>;</b> otherwise, there are not twenty-four non-kosher birds. But <b>since</b> it is assumed that the list in <b>Deuteronomy comes to add</b> to the list in Leviticus, <b>what is different here,</b> in Leviticus, <b>that it is written: “<i>Da’a</i>,”</b> and <b>what is different there,</b> in Deuteronomy, <b>that <i>da’a</i> is not written? Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the discrepancy that the two are the same? If so, one must conclude that according to Rabbi Abbahu, the <b><i>da’a</i> and <i>ra’a</i> and <i>ayya</i> are</b> all <b>one</b> species.
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>from</b> the fact that Rabbi Abbahu holds that the <b><i>ra’a</i> is</b> the same as the <b><i>ayya</i>, by inference,</b> one may conclude that the <b><i>dayya</i> is not</b> the same as the <b><i>ayya</i>.</b> But if so, one may ask again: <b>What is different there,</b> in Leviticus, <b>that it is written: “After its kinds,” about</b> the <b><i>ayya</i>, and what is different here,</b> in Deuteronomy, <b>that it is not written: “After its kinds,” about</b> the <b><i>ayya</i> but about</b> the <b><i>dayya</i>? Rather,</b> the <i>ayya</i> and <i>dayya</i> must be one species. And one may <b>learn from</b> the combination of the two disputes that according to Rabbi Abbahu, the <b><i>da’a</i> and <i>ra’a</i>, <i>dayya</i> and <i>ayya</i> are</b> all <b>one</b> species. Consequently, according to Rabbi Abbahu, there are only twenty-three non-kosher species.
§ With regard to the phrase: “The <i>ayya</i> after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:14), <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Isi ben Yehuda says: There are one hundred non-kosher birds in the East, and they are all species of <i>ayya</i>. Avimi, son of Rabbi Abbahu, taught: There are seven hundred types of</b> non-kosher <b>fish, and eight hundred types of</b> non-kosher <b>grasshopper, and there are countless birds.</b> The Gemara protests: Are there countless non-kosher <b>birds?</b> But <b>there are</b> only <b>twenty-four</b> non-kosher birds mentioned in the Torah. <b>Rather,</b> Avimi must have meant: <b>And there are countless kosher birds.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: It is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being that</b> the species of <b>non-kosher animals are more numerous than the kosher</b> ones. <b>Therefore, the Torah lists the kosher</b> animals, teaching that all the rest are non-kosher. On the other hand, <b>it is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being that</b> the species of <b>kosher birds are more numerous than the non-kosher</b> ones. <b>Therefore, the Torah lists the non-kosher</b> birds.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaching us?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>As Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav</b> says, <b>and some say</b> that <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says in the name of Rabbi Meir: A person should always teach his student in a concise manner,</b> just as the Torah is concise in its language.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: A kosher bird may be eaten on</b> the strength of <b>a tradition</b> that it is kosher, without inspecting for the signs listed in the mishna. And <b>the hunter is deemed credible to say: My teacher conveyed to me</b> that <b>this bird is kosher. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> only <b>when</b> the teacher <b>is familiar with</b> the non-kosher birds <b>and with their names.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> Was Rabbi Yoḥanan referring to the hunter’s <b>teacher the Sage, or</b> to <b>his teacher the hunter,</b> i.e., the one who taught him how to hunt? The Gemara responds: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from that <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And this</b> applies only <b>when</b> the teacher <b>is familiar with them and with their names. Granted, if you say</b> this is referring to <b>his teacher the hunter,</b> this works out <b>well. But if you say</b> it is referring to <b>his teacher the Sage, granted,</b> a Sage will know <b>their names,</b> since <b>he has learned them, but does he recognize</b> the birds <b>themselves? Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan referred to <b>his teacher the hunter?</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that this is so.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may buy eggs from the gentiles anywhere, and one</b> need <b>not</b> be <b>concerned, neither with regard to carcasses,</b> i.e., that the egg may have been removed from a carcass of a bird and therefore forbidden, <b>nor with regard to</b> eggs from <b><i>tereifot</i>,</b> because neither of these possibilities is likely.
The Gemara objects: <b>But perhaps they</b> are from <b>a non-kosher bird. Shmuel’s father said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case where the gentile <b>says</b> they are <b>of such and such bird,</b> which is known to be <b>kosher.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if the gentile is deemed credible, <b>let him say</b> only that they are <b>of a kosher bird.</b> Why does he need to name the species? The Gemara responds: <b>If so,</b> if he does not name the species, <b>he has</b> the opportunity to <b>deflect</b> scrutiny if he is dishonest; but if he names the species, one can bring other eggs of the same species to compare and validate the claim.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why must one rely on the gentile? <b>Let him inspect</b> the eggs <b>for signs, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Like the signs of</b> kosher <b>eggs, so</b> too are <b>the signs of fish.</b> The Gemara interjects: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>the signs of fish? The Merciful One states</b> them explicitly in the Torah: <b>“Fins and scales”</b> (Leviticus 11:9). <b>Rather, say: So</b> too are <b>the signs of</b>

Daf 64a

<b>fish embryos,</b> i.e., fish eggs found in the fish’s innards.
The Gemara continues: <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>about eggs</b> that <b>these are the signs of</b> bird <b>eggs: Any</b> egg <b>that narrows</b> at the top <b>and is rounded,</b> so that <b>one of its ends is rounded and</b> the other <b>one of its ends is pointed, is kosher.</b> If <b>both of its ends are rounded or both of its ends are pointed,</b> they are <b>non-kosher.</b> If the <b>albumen</b> is <b>on the outside and</b> the <b>yolk on the inside,</b> it is <b>kosher.</b> If the <b>yolk</b> is <b>on the outside and</b> the <b>albumen on the inside,</b> it is <b>non-kosher.</b> If the <b>yolk and albumen are mixed with each other, it is certainly the egg of a creeping animal.</b> Therefore, if it is possible to recognize a kosher egg by these signs, there is no need to rely on the gentile.
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> if the eggs have already been <b>cut</b> and one cannot know their original shape. The Gemara challenges: <b>But let him inspect the yolk and the albumen,</b> to see which is inside and which is outside. The Gemara responds: The <i>baraita</i> deals <b>with</b> a case where the eggs are <b>mixed in a bowl,</b> and it is impossible to discern this.
The Gemara counters: <b>But in a case like this,</b> where the eggs are mixed, <b>may we buy</b> eggs <b>from them? Isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may sell the egg of a <i>tereifa</i></b> bird <b>to a gentile only if it is mixed in a bowl; therefore, one may not buy eggs mixed in a bowl from them,</b> because they may be from <i>tereifot</i>? If so, it cannot be that the <i>baraita</i> deals with a case where they are mixed, and one should be able to inspect the yolk and albumen.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The <b>signs</b> of a kosher egg <b>are not</b> valid <b>by Torah law. As, if you do not say so,</b> one encounters difficulty with <b>that which Rav Asi says: There are eight</b> birds whose kosher status is <b>uncertain.</b> Why is there uncertainty? <b>Let one inspect their eggs</b> for the signs listed in the <i>baraita</i> to determine whether they are kosher. <b>Rather, learn from it</b> that the <b>signs are not</b> valid <b>by Torah law</b> and one may not rely on them.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if one may not rely on these signs, <b>with regard to what <i>halakha</i> is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaching</b> them? The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>both of its ends are rounded, or both its ends are pointed, or</b> the <b>yolk</b> is <b>on the outside and</b> the <b>albumen</b> is <b>on the inside,</b> it is <b>certainly non-kosher.</b> But if <b>one of its ends is pointed</b> and <b>one of its ends is rounded, and</b> the <b>albumen</b> is <b>on the outside and</b> the <b>yolk on the inside, and</b> the gentile <b>says to you</b> that it is <b>from such and such bird, and</b> that bird <b>is kosher, rely on</b> the signs. But if he offers <b>no specification</b> of the type of bird, or if one simply finds eggs with these signs, <b>do not rely on them, since there are crow’s</b> eggs <b>that resemble those of a pigeon.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said:</b> If the <b>albumen and yolk are mixed with each other, it is certainly the egg of a creeping animal</b> and not of a non-kosher bird. The Gemara asks: <b>For what <i>halakha</i></b> is this information necessary? Either way, the egg is forbidden. <b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> means <b>to say that if tissue</b> of an embryo <b>developed [<i>rikema</i>]</b> inside it <b>and it was perforated,</b> and one touched it, <b>it transmits ritual impurity</b> provided <b>that</b> the embryo is at least the size <b>of a lentil-bulk,</b> because the carcass of a creeping animal of this size is a source of ritual impurity.
<b>Ravina objects to this: But perhaps it is</b> the egg <b>of a snake,</b> whose carcass does not transmit ritual impurity, even though the albumen and yolk of its eggs are mixed together. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> does not teach about ritual impurity, but rather <b>that if tissue</b> of an embryo <b>developed</b> inside the egg <b>and one ate it, he is flogged on its account, due to</b> the prohibition: “And every <b>swarming thing that swarms upon the earth</b> is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41).
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why specifically</b> mention the egg <b>of a non-kosher</b> creeping animal? The same would apply <b>even</b> for one who eats the embryo <b>of a kosher</b> bird <b>as well.</b> In either case, one is flogged, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“Every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth,”</b>

Daf 64b

serves <b>to include chicks</b> of pigeons <b>whose eyes have not</b> yet <b>opened</b> in the prohibition against consuming swarming things. The Gemara responds: This prohibition is <b>by rabbinic</b> law, <b>and the verse</b> cited is <b>a mere support</b> for it. One who eats the embryo of a kosher bird is not liable to receive lashes.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Kosher <b>eggs</b> that have been <b>boiled</b> with non-kosher eggs are <b>permitted. Unfertilized eggs</b> are permitted, and one of <b>strong constitution may eat them,</b> even if the hen has sat on them for a long period of time. If <b>a drop [<i>koret</i>] of blood is found on it,</b> one <b>discards the blood,</b> which is the first stage of an embryo’s development, <b>and eats the rest.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: And this</b> applies <b>when</b> the blood <b>is found on its knot,</b> i.e., the place in the albumen where the embryo begins to develop, since this proves that tissue has not developed elsewhere in the egg. And so <b>taught Dostai, father of Rabbi Aptoriki:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that one may eat the rest of the egg <b>only when</b> the blood <b>is found on its albumen,</b> i.e., the knot; <b>but</b> if <b>it is found on its yolk, even</b> the rest of <b>the egg is forbidden. What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>that the decay has spread through all of it. Rav Geviha from Bei Ketil said to Rav Ashi: A <i>tanna</i> taught the opposite before Abaye,</b> that one may eat the rest of the egg only when the blood is found on its yolk, <b>and it is Abaye that corrected it</b> in <b>this</b> manner.
§ <b>Ḥizkiyya says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the egg of a non-kosher</b> bird <b>is prohibited by Torah</b> law? <b>As it is stated: “And the daughter [<i>bat</i>] of the <i>ya’ana</i>”</b> (Leviticus 11:16). <b>But does the <i>ya’ana</i> have a daughter</b> whose forbidden status would be different from that of its mother? Both daughter and mother should be included in the same prohibition. <b>Rather, which</b> is this? <b>This is a non-kosher egg.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps this is their name,</b> i.e., the bird is called <i>bat ya’ana</i>. The Gemara responds: This <b>should not enter your mind, as it is written: “The daughter of my people has become cruel, like the <i>ye’enim</i> in the wilderness”</b> (Lamentations 4:3).
The Gemara persists: <b>And</b> is <i>bat ya’ana</i> <b>not</b> its name? <b>But isn’t it written: “I will make a wailing like the jackals, and a mourning like the daughters [<i>benot</i>] of the <i>ya’ana</i>”</b> (Micah 1:8)? The Gemara responds: The verse means: I will make mourning <b>like this <i>ya’ana</i> that mourns for its children.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And <i>benot ya’ana</i> shall dwell there”</b> (Isaiah 13:21)? The Gemara responds: Here too, the verse means: And they shall dwell there <b>like this <i>ya’ana</i> that dwells with its children.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “The animals of the field shall honor Me, the jackals and the <i>benot ya’ana</i>”</b> (Isaiah 43:20)? <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the term <i>bat ya’ana</i> is referring to <b>an egg, can an egg sing a song</b> of praise to God? <b>Rather,</b> one must say: <b>The <i>ya’ana</i> is written, and the <i>bat ya’ana</i> is</b> also <b>written,</b> and both are acceptable names for this bird.
<b>And</b> still, the name <b>here is different</b> from those of other animals, in <b>that the scribe splits</b> it <b>into two words:</b> <i>Bat ya’ana</i>, even though it is one species. <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that the scribe splits it</b>

Daf 65a

<b>into two words, conclude from it</b> that <b>they are two names,</b> prohibiting the egg as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> what about the name: <b>“Chedorlaomer”</b> (Genesis 14:4), <b>which the scribe splits in two</b> so that it appears as: Chedor Laomer? Is it <b>also</b> true there <b>that they are two names?</b> The verse is clearly referring to only one person. <b>They say</b> in response: <b>There,</b> with regard to Chedor Laomer, the scribe <b>splits</b> the name <b>into two words,</b> but he <b>may not split it into two lines</b> if the first half nears the end of one line. <b>But here, he may split</b> the name <i>bat ya’ana</i> <b>even into two lines,</b> indicating that they are completely separate.
§ The mishna states: <b>But the Sages stated</b> that <b>any bird</b> that claws its prey and eats it is non-kosher. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Gamliel says:</b> A bird that <b>claws</b> its prey <b>and eats</b> it <b>is certainly non-kosher.</b> If <b>it has an extra digit and a crop, and its gizzard can be peeled, it is certainly kosher. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: One stretches a line,</b> and the bird perches on it. <b>If it splits its feet</b> on the line, with <b>two</b> digits <b>here and two there,</b> it is <b>non-kosher.</b> If it places <b>three</b> digits <b>here and one there,</b> it is possibly <b>kosher. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Any bird that catches</b> food <b>out of the air is non-kosher.</b>
The Gemara interjects: But the <b><i>tziparta</i> also catches</b> food out of the air, and it is kosher. <b>Abaye said: We say</b> this only for a bird that both <b>catches and eats</b> its food in the air. The <i>tziparta</i> lands before eating what it has caught.
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>Others say:</b> If a bird <b>dwells with non-kosher</b> birds, it is <b>non-kosher;</b> if it dwells <b>with kosher</b> birds, it is <b>kosher.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this last statement? Perhaps it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It was <b>not for naught</b> that the <b><i>zarzir</i> went</b> to dwell <b>with the crow, but because it is</b> of the same <b>species.</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the opinion introduced with the words: Others say, is like that of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Eliezer and deem the <i>zarzir</i> kosher. The statement introduced with the words: Others say, is understood as follows: <b>We say</b> that a bird is non-kosher whenever it both <b>dwells</b> with a non-kosher bird <b>and resembles</b> it. The <i>zarzir</i>, though, does not resemble the crow.
§ The mishna states: <b>And with regard to grasshoppers, any</b> grasshopper <b>that has</b> four legs, and four wings, and two additional jumping legs, and whose wings cover most of its body, is kosher. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is considered <b>most of its</b> body? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Most of its length. And some say</b> that he said: <b>Most of its circumference. Rav Pappa said: Therefore,</b> one must satisfy both versions of the statement. <b>We require</b> that the wings cover <b>most of its length, and we</b> also <b>require</b> that they cover <b>most of its circumference.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A grasshopper that <b>has no</b> wings <b>now but will grow</b> them <b>after a time, e.g., the <i>zaḥal</i>, is permitted. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, says:</b> The verse states: “Yet these may you eat of all winged swarming things that go upon all fours, <b>which have [<i>lo</i>] jointed legs</b> above their feet, wherewith to leap upon the earth” (Leviticus 11:21). The word <i>lo</i> is written with the letter <i>alef</i>, meaning not, so that it can be understood as: Do not have jointed legs. This teaches that <b>even though it has no</b> jointed legs <b>now but will grow</b> them <b>after a time,</b> it is still kosher. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b><i>zaḥal</i>? Abaye said:</b> It is called <b><i>askarin</i></b> in Aramaic.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“These of them you may eat: The <i>arbeh</i></b> after its kinds, and the <i>solam</i> after its kinds, and the <i>ḥargol</i> after its kinds, and the <i>ḥagav</i> after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:22). The <b><i>arbeh</i> is</b> the insect known as the <b><i>govai</i>.</b> The <b><i>solam</i> is</b> the <b><i>rashon</i>.</b> The <b><i>ḥargol</i> is</b> the <b><i>nippul</i>.</b> The <b><i>ḥagav</i> is</b> the <b><i>gadyan</i>. Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “After its kinds,” “after its kinds,” “after its kinds,”</b> and <b>“after its kinds,” four times? It is to include</b> four similar species: The <b>vineyard bird, and</b> the <b>Jerusalem <i>yoḥana</i>, and the <i>artzuveya</i>, and the <i>razbanit</i>,</b> which are also kosher.
<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: These</b> appearances of the phrase “after its kinds” in the verse <b>are generalizations, and these</b> species mentioned explicitly <b>are details.</b> The verse must be understood in light of the previous verse, which offers general signs of a kosher grasshopper. The two verses together are a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, in the following manner: The first verse is a generalization, <b><i>arbeh</i> is</b> a detail referring to the species <b><i>govai</i>,</b> and the phrase <b>“after its kinds”</b> is another generalization. According to Rabbi Yishmael’s hermeneutical principles, the second generalization serves to include a case similar to the detail. In this case, the phrase “after its kinds” serves <b>to include</b>

Daf 65b

the <b>vineyard bird,</b> which is similar to the <i>arbeh</i> in that its forehead is not smooth but has small hairs.
<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a species <b>that comes</b> before a person <b>and does not have a smooth forehead</b> is kosher. <b>From where</b> is it derived that even one <b>that comes</b> before a person <b>and has a smooth forehead</b> is kosher? <b>The verse states: “<i>Solam</i>,”</b> and <b>this is</b> the <b><i>nippul</i>,</b> which has a smooth forehead. The phrase <b>“after its kinds”</b> that follows <i>solam</i> is another generalization, which serves <b>to include</b> a case similar to the detail, i.e., <b>the <i>ushkaf</i>,</b> which has a smooth forehead like the <i>solam</i>.
<b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a species <b>that comes</b> before a person <b>and does not have a smooth forehead,</b> like the <i>arbeh</i>, or one <b>that comes</b> before a person <b>and has a smooth forehead,</b> like the <i>solam</i>, or one that <b>comes</b> before a person <b>and has no tail,</b> is kosher, since none of the previously mentioned grasshoppers have a tail. <b>From where</b> is it derived that even one <b>that comes</b> before a person <b>and has a tail</b> is kosher? <b>The verse states: “<i>Ḥargol</i>,”</b> and <b>this is</b> the <b><i>rashon</i>,</b> which has a tail. The phrase <b>“after its kinds”</b> that follows <i>ḥargol</i> is another generalization, and it serves <b>to include the <i>karsefet</i> and the <i>shaḥlanit</i>,</b> which also have tails.
<b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a species <b>that comes</b> before a person <b>and does not have a smooth forehead,</b> or <b>that comes</b> before a person <b>and has a smooth forehead,</b> or <b>that comes and has no tail,</b> or <b>that comes and has a tail,</b> or <b>that comes and its head is not long,</b> is kosher, since every grasshopper mentioned until this point does not have a long head. <b>From where</b> is it derived that even one <b>that comes and its head is long</b> is kosher?
<b>You</b> will <b>say: You derive a paradigm from the three of them,</b> as follows: <b>The aspect [<i>re’i</i>] of</b> the <b><i>arbeh</i>,</b> which has neither smooth forehead nor tail, <b>is not similar to the aspect of</b> the <b><i>ḥargol</i>,</b> which has both; <b>and the aspect of</b> the <b><i>ḥargol</i> is not similar to the aspect of</b> the <b><i>arbeh</i>. And the aspect of neither of them is similar to the aspect of</b> the <b><i>solam</i>,</b> which has a smooth forehead but no tail, <b>and the aspect of</b> the <b><i>solam</i> is similar to neither of their aspects.</b> The characteristic that renders them all kosher can only be an aspect common to all of them. <b>Their common denominator is that</b> each <b>has four legs, and four wings, and jumping legs, and its wings cover most of its</b> body. <b>So too, any</b> other species <b>that has four legs, and four wings, and jumping legs, and its wings cover most of its</b> body is kosher, even if its head is long.
One might ask: <b>But doesn’t this <i>tzartzur</i> have four legs, and four wings, and jumping legs, and its wings cover most of its</b> body? Consequently, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>it should be permitted.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “<i>Ḥagav</i>,”</b> to indicate <b>that its name</b> must be <b><i>ḥagav</i>.</b> This includes all of the species previously mentioned, but not the <i>tzartzur</i>.
But <b>if its name</b> must be <b><i>ḥagav</i>,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that any <i>ḥagav</i> is kosher, even if <b>it does not have all these signs.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “After its kinds,”</b> indicating that even if it is called a <i>ḥagav</i> it is not kosher <b>unless it has all these signs.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael.
<b>Rav Aḥai refutes</b> the <i>baraita</i>: The four signs listed are not the sole common denominators between the <i>arbeh</i>, <i>ḥargol</i>, and <i>solam</i>. <b>What</b> is also unique <b>about these</b> grasshoppers in addition to these signs? They are unique <b>in that their heads are not long.</b> If so, grasshoppers with long heads might not be kosher. <b>And if you would say: Since they share</b> these <b>four signs, we include</b> all others with these four signs <b>and we do not refute</b> them, since the included species need not be identical in all their aspects, <b>if so,</b> the Torah <b>should not even write</b> the <b><i>ḥargol</i>, which shares</b> these four signs <b>with</b> the <i>arbeh</i> and the <i>solam</i>, <b>and let it be derived</b> that the <i>ḥargol</i> is kosher by inference <b>from the</b> common denominators between the <b><i>arbeh</i> and <i>solam</i>.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it was necessary for the verse to write <i>ḥargol</i> because if it were omitted, its inclusion <b>could be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about these,</b> the <i>arbeh</i> and <i>solam</i>? They are unique <b>in that they</b> both <b>have no tail.</b> Since the <i>ḥargol</i> has a tail, its kosher status cannot be inferred from theirs. <b>So too,</b> the inclusion of grasshoppers with long heads <b>can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about these,</b> the <i>arbeh</i>, <i>ḥargol</i>, and <i>solam</i>? They are unique <b>in that their heads are not long.</b> If so, grasshoppers with long heads might not be kosher.
<b>Rather, Rav Aḥai said:</b> One can derive that grasshoppers with long heads are kosher as follows: The <b><i>solam</i></b> mentioned in the verse <b>is redundant.</b> How so? <b>Let the Merciful One not write <i>solam</i>, and</b> instead <b>let it be derived</b> by inference <b>from</b> the common denominators between the <b><i>arbeh</i> and <i>ḥargol</i>,</b> that they have four legs, four wings, jumping legs, and that their wings cover most of their body. <b>As what can you</b> say to <b>refute</b> this? If you say: <b>What</b> can be derived <b>from</b> the <b><i>arbeh</i>, which,</b> unlike the <i>solam</i>, <b>does not have a smooth forehead;</b> one can respond: <b>But</b> there is the <b><i>ḥargol</i>, which has a smooth forehead.</b> And if you say: <b>What</b> can be derived <b>from</b> the <b><i>ḥargol</i>, which,</b> unlike the <i>solam</i>, <b>has a tail,</b> one can respond: <b>But</b> there is the <b><i>arbeh</i>, which has no tail.</b> If so, <b>why do I</b> need the <b><i>solam</i> that the Merciful One wrote?</b> Rather, <b>if</b> the <i>solam</i> <b>is not</b> necessary <b>for the matter itself, apply it</b> to the <b>matter of a long-headed</b> grasshopper, to teach that it is kosher.

Daf 66a

The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do the <i>tanna</i> of the study hall,</b> who taught the first <i>baraita</i> above, <b>and the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael disagree? They disagree with regard to</b> a grasshopper <b>whose head is long.</b> According to the <i>tanna</i> of the study hall it is prohibited, and according to the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael it is permitted.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>The <i>tanna</i> of the study hall holds</b> that the previous verse, permitting all species <b>“which have jointed legs”</b> (Leviticus 11:21), is <b>a generalization.</b> The species <b><i>arbeh</i>, <i>solam</i>, <i>ḥargol</i>,</b> and <b><i>ḥagav</i>,</b> and the phrase <b>“after its kinds,”</b> that appears after each, are <b>a detail.</b> As a rule, in any instance of <b>a generalization and a detail, the generalization includes only that which is</b> spelled out <b>in the detail.</b> Therefore, only grasshoppers <b>of the</b> same <b>species as</b> those detailed in the verse <b>are</b> kosher. Grasshoppers <b>that are not of the</b> same <b>species as</b> them are <b>not</b> kosher. <b>And</b> the phrase “after its kinds” <b>amplifies</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include grasshoppers <b>that are similar to</b> the named species <b>in two aspects,</b> i.e., that are very similar to them. Since all the named species have short heads, grasshoppers with long heads are forbidden.
By contrast, <b>the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael holds</b> that the phrase <b>“which have jointed legs”</b> is <b>a generalization.</b> The species <b><i>arbeh</i>, <i>solam</i>, <i>ḥargol</i>,</b> and <b><i>ḥagav</i></b> are a <b>detail.</b> And by the phrase <b>“after its kinds”</b> after each species, <b>it then generalized</b> again. In any instance of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. And</b> the verse therefore <b>amplifies</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include <b>any</b> grasshopper <b>that is similar to</b> the named species <b>in</b> even <b>one aspect,</b> i.e., that has the four signs listed in the mishna, even if its head is long.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> how can this be considered a generalization, a detail, and a generalization? <b>The first generalization is not similar to the latter generalization.</b> In <b>the first generalization, the Merciful One states: “Which have jointed legs,”</b> indicating that you may <b>eat</b> a grasshopper <b>that has</b> jointed legs, but <b>you may not eat</b> one <b>that does not have</b> jointed legs, irrespective of any other sign. However, <b>the latter generalization:</b> “After its kinds,” indicates that no grasshopper is kosher <b>unless it shares</b> all <b>four signs</b> with the named species.
The Gemara responds: <b>The <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael deduces</b> from <b>generalizations and details like this case,</b> even if the generalizations are not similar to one another. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> that <b>which we also say generally, that the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael deduces</b> from <b>generalizations and details like this case,</b> is derived <b>from here.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael: <b>The Master said: If its name</b> must be <b><i>ḥagav</i>,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that any <i>ḥagav</i> is kosher, even if <b>it does not have all these</b> four <b>signs.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “After its kinds,”</b> indicating that it is not kosher <b>unless it has all these signs.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where would this be derived,</b> that a grasshopper is kosher even if <b>it does not have all these signs?</b> How could one entertain this possibility? <b><i>Arbeh</i> and <i>ḥargol</i> are written</b> beforehand, indicating that all kosher grasshoppers must share the signs they both possess.
The Gemara responds: <b>If <i>solam</i> had not been written</b> as well, it would be <b>as you said.</b> But <b>now that it is written: “<i>Solam</i>,” to include long-headed</b> grasshoppers even though none of the named species have long heads, <b>I will say: Let us also include any</b> grasshopper that is called <i>ḥagav</i>. Therefore, the phrase “after its kinds” <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> of the study hall, <b>that you say</b> that the <b><i>solam</i> is</b> the <b><i>rashon</i>,</b> and the <b><i>ḥargol</i> is</b> the <b><i>nippul</i>, and what is different here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael, <b>that you say:</b> The <b><i>solam</i> is</b> the <b><i>nippul</i>,</b> and the <b><i>ḥargol</i> is</b> the <b><i>rashon</i>?</b> The Gemara responds: This <b>Sage</b> refers to them <b>in accordance with</b> the custom of <b>his locale and</b> that <b>Sage</b> refers to them <b>in accordance with</b> the custom of <b>his locale.</b>
§ The mishna states: <b>And with regard to fish, any</b> fish <b>that has a fin and a scale</b> is kosher. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a fish <b>does not have</b> scales <b>now but will grow</b> them <b>after</b> a period of <b>time, such as the <i>sultanit</i> and <i>afyan</i></b> fish, <b>it is permitted.</b> Likewise, if <b>it has</b> scales <b>now but will shed them when it</b> is caught and <b>rises from the water, such as</b>

Daf 66b

the <b><i>akunas</i>, and</b> the <b><i>afunas</i>,</b> and the <b><i>kesaftiyas</i>, and</b> the <b><i>akhsaftiyas</i>, and</b> the <b><i>atunas</i>, it is permitted.</b>
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Nidda</i> 51b): <b>Any</b> fish <b>that has scales</b> certainly <b>has fins, but there are</b> fish <b>that have fins and do not have scales.</b> Any fish that <b>has scales and fins</b> is <b>a kosher fish.</b> If <b>it has fins but no scales,</b> it is <b>a non-kosher fish.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Now,</b> since <b>we rely</b> only <b>on scales</b> to deem a fish kosher, presuming that if it has scales it must have fins as well, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> only <b>“scales”</b> as the sign of a kosher fish <b>and let</b> Him <b>not write “fins”</b> at all. The Gemara responds: <b>If the Merciful One had written: Scales [<i>kaskeset</i>], and had not written: Fins [<i>senappir</i>], I would say: What</b> is <b><i>kaskeset</i>?</b> It is <b>fins. And</b> I would thereby come to permit <b>even non-kosher fish.</b> Therefore, <b>the Merciful One stated: “<i>Senappir</i> and <i>kaskeset</i>,”</b> to leave no room for error.
The Gemara asks: <b>But now that the Merciful One has written: “<i>Senappir</i> and <i>kaskeset</i>,” from where</b> is it derived that <b><i>kaskeset</i></b> denotes <b>clothing,</b> i.e., scales, rather than fins? <b>As it is written: “And he was clad with a coat of scale armor [<i>kaskasim</i>]”</b> (I Samuel 17:5). And if it is certain that <i>kaskeset</i> refers to scales, the question resurfaces: <b>Let the Merciful One write</b> only <b>“<i>kaskeset</i>,” and let</b> Him <b>not write “<i>senappir</i>.”</b>
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said, and so the <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael</b> taught: The Holy One, Blessed be He, wished to bestow good upon the Jewish people. Therefore, He made their Torah abundant, as it is written: “The Lord was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake, <b>to make Torah great and glorious”</b> (Isaiah 42:21). He consequently expanded some aspects of the Torah more than strictly necessary.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states the prohibition of non-kosher fish both positively and negatively: “These may you eat of all that are in the waters: Whatever has fins and scales…them you may eat. And all that have not fins and scales…they are a detestable thing unto you” (Leviticus 11:9–10). <b>From the implication</b> of <b>that</b> which <b>is stated: Eat</b> fish <b>that have</b> these signs, <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> the inverse: <b>Do not eat</b> fish <b>that do not have</b> them. <b>And from the implication</b> of <b>that</b> which <b>is stated: Do not eat</b> fish <b>that do not have</b> them, <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> the inverse: <b>Eat</b> fish <b>that have</b> them. If so, <b>why</b> did the Torah <b>teach</b> both of <b>them?</b> It is in order <b>to</b> indicate that one who eats non-kosher fish <b>transgresses, on its account,</b> both <b>a positive mitzva and a prohibition.</b>
Given that the verse states: “Whatever has fins and scales…them may you eat,” <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “These <b>may you eat of all that are in the waters?”</b> Why is this necessary? It is necessary, <b>as</b> without this verse one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Since</b> the Torah <b>permitted</b> creeping creatures of the water without fins and scales <b>explicitly and</b> also <b>permitted</b> them <b>implicitly,</b> one can infer: <b>Just as when</b> the Torah <b>permitted</b> such creatures <b>explicitly, it permitted</b> them <b>only</b> when <b>in vessels, so too, when it permitted</b> them <b>implicitly, it permitted</b> them <b>only in vessels. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> as kosher even those in <b>pits, ditches, and caves, that</b> one may <b>dig</b> them <b>and drink from them and</b> need <b>not refrain</b> from drinking the creeping creatures in them? <b>The verse states:</b> “These <b>may you eat of all that are in the waters,”</b> to indicate that this is permitted.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Where did</b> the Torah <b>permit</b> them <b>in vessels?</b> It did so in the following verse, <b>as it is written: “These may you eat of all that are in the waters:</b> Whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, them may you eat.” It would have been sufficient to write simply: “In the waters.” The addition of “in the seas and in the rivers” indicates that <b>it is</b> only <b>in the seas and in the rivers that when it has</b> fins and scales you may <b>eat</b> it, and that <b>you</b> may <b>not eat</b> one <b>that does not have</b> them. <b>But</b> with regard to a creeping creature found <b>in vessels, even if it does not have</b> fins and scales you may <b>eat</b> it.
The Gemara objects: One could just as easily <b>say</b> the opposite: You may eat a fish that has these signs only when it is found in seas and rivers, but <b>in vessels, even if it has</b> fins and scales, <b>you</b> may <b>not eat</b> it. The Gemara responds: This should <b>not enter your mind, as it is written: “And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that swarm in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters,</b> they are a detestable thing to you.” The verse indicates that it is only <b>in the seas and in the rivers that you</b> may <b>not eat</b> a fish <b>that does not have</b> fins and scales. <b>But</b> you may <b>eat</b> a creeping creature found <b>in vessels, even if it does not have</b> fins and scales.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> one can prove whether it is permitted to drink from pits, ditches, and caves differently. <b>Say</b> instead that the phrase “whatever has fins and scales <b>in the waters”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> and the phrase <b>“in the seas and in the rivers”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> In any instance of <b>a generalization and a detail, the generalization only includes that which is</b> spelled out <b>in the detail.</b> Therefore, in the <b>seas and rivers, yes,</b> one may eat only fish with fins and scales, but in <b>water channels and trenches,</b> as well as pits, ditches, and caves, this restriction does <b>not</b> apply. Consequently, the clause “These may you eat of all that are in the waters” is unnecessary.
The Gemara responds: This deduction is not sound. The term <b>“in the waters”</b> appears twice in the verse. When the verse repeated it, <b>it then generalized</b> again. Consequently, there are two generalizations and one detail in the verse, making it an instance of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, which includes all cases similar to the detail, including pits, ditches, and caves, indicating that the restriction applies to them as well. Therefore, the clause “These may you eat of all that are in the waters” is necessary to teach that all fish in pits, ditches, and caves are permitted.
The Gemara asks: How can this verse be an instance of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization? <b>These are two generalizations that are adjacent to each other.</b> Both instances of the term “in the waters” precede the detail, such that the verse is actually a generalization, a generalization, and a detail. <b>Ravina said: As they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>Wherever you find two generalizations juxtaposed one with the other,</b> followed by a specific detail,

Daf 67a

<b>place</b> the <b>detail between</b> the two generalizations <b>and</b> then <b>expound them as a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization.</b> Therefore, the first instance of the phrase <b>“in the waters”</b> is <b>a generalization.</b> The phrase <b>“in the seas and in the rivers”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> And by the second instance of the phrase <b>“in the waters,” it then generalized</b> again.
Therefore, as in any instance of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. Just as the detail,</b> seas and rivers, is referring <b>explicitly</b> to <b>flowing water, so too,</b> fish without fins and scales found in <b>all flowing water</b> are forbidden. <b>What</b> does this <b>include?</b> It includes <b>trenches and water channels, to prohibit</b> fish without fins and scales found in them. <b>And what</b> does it <b>exclude?</b> It excludes <b>pits, ditches, and caves,</b> which are collections of still water, <b>to permit</b> all fish found in them.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say: Just as the detail</b> refers <b>explicitly</b> to <b>water that grows,</b> i.e., is found, <b>on the ground, so too,</b> it includes <b>all water that grows on the ground? And what</b> would this <b>include?</b> It would include <b>even pits, ditches, and caves, to prohibit</b> fish found in them that do not have fins and scales. <b>And what</b> would it <b>exclude?</b> It would <b>exclude</b> only those found in <b>vessels.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>If so, what use is</b> the phrase “These <b>may you eat</b> of all that are in the waters”? Even without it, vessels would be excluded, since they are not at all similar to seas and rivers. Rather, the phrase “These may you eat of all that are in the waters” serves to indicate that only trenches and water channels are considered similar to the detail, but all fish found in pits, ditches, and caves are permitted.
§ The <i>tanna</i> of the school of <b>Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The verse’s use of the phrase <b>“in the waters,” “in the waters” twice is not</b> to be interpreted as <b>a generalization and a detail,</b> but <b>rather</b> as an instance of <b>amplification and restriction.</b> By the first phrase <b>“in the waters,”</b> the verse <b>amplifies,</b> by the phrase <b>“in the seas and in the rivers” it restricts,</b> and by the second instance of <b>“in the waters” it then amplifies again.</b> According to a hermeneutical principle, when a verse <b>amplified, and</b> then <b>restricted, and</b> then <b>amplified, it amplified</b> the relevant category to include <b>everything</b> except for the specific matter excluded by the restriction, i.e., in the seas and in the rivers. <b>What,</b> then, <b>does it include?</b> It includes <b>trenches and water channels, to prohibit</b> fish without fins and scales found in them. <b>And what does it exclude?</b> It excludes fish found in <b>pits, ditches, and caves, to permit</b> them.
The Gemara objects: Why not <b>say: What does it include?</b> It includes fish found in <b>pits, ditches, and caves, to prohibit</b> them if they do not have fins and scales. <b>And what does it exclude?</b> It excludes only fish found in <b>vessels.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>If so, what use is</b> the phrase “These <b>may you eat</b> of all that are in the waters”? Even without it, vessels would be excluded. Rather, it indicates that pits, ditches and caves are excluded by the restriction, and all fish found in them are permitted.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> perhaps <b>l should reverse</b> the statement and claim that fish without fins and scales in pits, ditches, and caves are prohibited, and those in trenches and water channels are permitted. The Gemara responds: One must say <b>as Mattitya taught, as Mattitya bar Yehuda taught: What did you see</b> that caused you <b>to include pits, ditches, and caves, to permit</b> them, <b>and to exclude trenches and water channels, to prohibit</b> them? <b>I include pits, ditches, and caves, which</b> contain <b>still</b> water <b>like vessels, and I exclude trenches and water channels, which are not still like vessels,</b> as water flows through them.
§ The <i>baraita</i> on the previous <i>amud</i> states that the Torah permits all fish without fins and scales in vessels both explicitly and implicitly. The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> verse is the <b>implicit</b> source <b>and which</b> is the <b>explicit</b> source? <b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree with regard to it. One says:</b> The verse permitting “whatever <b>has</b> fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers,” is the <b>explicit</b> source, <b>and</b> the verse prohibiting “all that <b>have not</b> fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers,” is the <b>implicit</b> source. <b>And one says</b> the opposite, i.e., that the verse prohibiting “all that <b>have not</b> fins and scales” is the <b>explicit</b> source <b>and</b> the verse that permits “whatever <b>has</b> fins and scales” is the <b>implicit</b> source.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the one who says</b> that “whatever <b>has</b> fins and scales” is the <b>explicit</b> source? The Gemara responds: That Sage could have <b>said to you: It is from</b> this verse <b>that</b> the Gemara derives on the previous <i>amud</i> that fish without fins and scales found in <b>vessels are permitted.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the one who says</b> that “all that <b>have not</b> fins and scales” is the <b>explicit</b> source? The Gemara responds: The reasoning is <b>that it is this</b> verse <b>that proves that the other</b> verse permits all fish in vessels. <b>As, if</b> one attempted to derive whether fish in vessels are permitted <b>from the other</b> verse alone, <b>I would say</b> the opposite: The verse indicates that a fish with fins and scales is permitted only in the seas and rivers; but <b>in vessels, even if it has</b> fins and scales, <b>you</b> may <b>still not eat</b> it. The phrase in the verse “and all that have not fins and scales” indicates that these restrictions apply only to fish in the seas and rivers.
§ <b>Rav Huna says: A person should not pour beer</b> into a vessel <b>through straw</b> to filter it <b>at night, lest</b> a creeping animal <b>emerge</b> from the beer <b>above the straw and then fall into the cup.</b> Since the drinker poured the beer through a filter, he will assume that all creatures found in the vessel originated there and are permitted despite lacking fins and scales. He will therefore drink the beer along with the creature, <b>and</b> in doing so, he <b>violates</b> the prohibition: “Every <b>swarming thing that swarms upon the earth</b> is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41).
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> that one must be concerned that a creeping animal may have fallen from the straw into the cup, one should <b>also</b> be concerned about any beer found <b>in a vessel,</b> as <b>perhaps</b> some creature <b>emerged</b> from the beer <b>onto the side of the vessel,</b> thereby becoming forbidden, <b>and then fell</b> back <b>into the vessel.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>There, that is</b> the creature’s normal manner of <b>growth,</b> to attach itself to the sides of the vessel, and it is not considered to have emerged from the liquid.
<b>And from where do you say</b> that emerging in its normal manner of growth does not render it forbidden? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to include pits, ditches, and caves, that</b> one may <b>dig</b> them <b>and drink from them and</b> need <b>not refrain</b> from drinking the creeping creatures inside them? <b>The verse states:</b> “These <b>may you eat of all that are in the waters,”</b> indicating that all fish in pits, ditches, and caves are permitted. <b>And</b> one might ask: <b>Let</b> one <b>be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> a creature <b>emerged</b> from the water <b>onto the side</b> of the pit or cave, thereby becoming forbidden, <b>and then fell</b> back into it. <b>Rather,</b> one must say that since <b>that is</b> the creature’s normal manner of <b>growth,</b> it does not render it forbidden. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to beer in a vessel, <b>that is</b> the creature’s normal manner of <b>growth</b> and does not render it forbidden.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Huna:</b> A <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught that supports your</b> statement that one need be concerned only about filtered beer: The verse: <b>“Every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth</b> is a detestable thing” (Leviticus 11:41), serves <b>to include gnats</b> found in liquid <b>that one filtered.</b> One may infer: <b>The reason</b> they are prohibited is <b>because one filtered</b> the liquids, <b>but</b> if one <b>did not filter them,</b> the gnats <b>are permitted.</b> Evidently, one need not be concerned that they emerged from the water onto the side of the vessel.
§ With regard to the prohibition against consuming creeping animals, <b>Shmuel says: A cucumber that became infested with worms</b>

Daf 67b

<b>while attached to the ground is prohibited, due to</b> the prohibition of: “Every <b>swarming thing that swarms upon the earth,”</b> because the cucumber was considered part of the earth when the worms infested it.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that a comparison of the following two <i>baraitot</i> <b>supports</b> Shmuel’s opinion. <b>As it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: “Every swarming thing that swarms <b>upon the earth”</b> serves <b>to exclude <i>zizin</i>,</b> a type of insect <b>that</b> is found <b>in lentils, and mosquitoes that are in <i>kelisim</i>,</b> a type of bean, <b>and worms that are in dates and in dried figs.</b> All of these are permitted for consumption because they do not swarm on the earth itself. <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states: <b>“Every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth,”</b> the word “every” serves <b>to include</b> as non-kosher <b>worms that are in the roots of olive trees and that are in the roots of vines.</b>
<b>What, is it not</b> that both <b>this and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are referring to insects that are found <b>in the fruit, and this,</b> the latter <i>baraita</i>, deems forbidden fruit that is <b>attached to the ground, and that,</b> the former <i>baraita</i>, deems permitted fruit <b>that is not attached to the ground?</b> This would support Shmuel’s statement that worms in a cucumber attached to the ground are forbidden.
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is possible that both <b>this and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are referring to insects found in vegetation <b>attached to the ground; and</b> the apparent contradiction between the two is <b>not difficult. This,</b> the former <i>baraita</i>, deems permitted insects found <b>in the fruit,</b> and <b>that,</b> the latter <i>baraita</i>, deems forbidden insects found <b>in the tree itself.</b> This interpretation contradicts Shmuel’s statement.
The Gemara notes: The language of the latter <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise, as it teaches: Worms that are in the roots of olive trees and in the roots of vines,</b> clearly referring to the tree itself rather than the fruit. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from it</b> that the second interpretation is correct.
§ From the above discussion, it is clear that worms that grow in produce not attached to the ground, and have never emerged from the produce, do not fall under the prohibition of: “Every swarming thing that swarms upon the earth,” because they have never swarmed on the earth. <b>Rav Yosef raises a dilemma:</b> If a worm <b>emerged</b> from the produce <b>but died</b> before it reached the earth, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered to have swarmed on the earth simply by having emerged? If only <b>part of it</b> emerged, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If it emerged <b>into the air of the world</b> and flew away without landing, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds to all of the above: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> If a worm was spawned in a date, and it emerges and climbs <b>onto the roof of</b> the <b>date,</b> i.e., its upper part, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this considered the normal manner of growth for the worm, in which case this does not render it forbidden, or is the roof of the date considered a separate entity such that crawling there constitutes swarming on the earth? And if it is considered a separate entity, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if the worm climbed <b>onto the roof of</b> the date’s <b>pit?</b> Is this considered the normal manner of growth for the worm? If the worm emerged <b>from a date</b> and entered <b>a date</b> that was attached to it, without being exposed to the air, <b>what</b> then <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds to all of the above: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, says: <i>Kukeyanei</i>,</b> worms found in the internal organs of animals, e.g., in the lung and liver, are <b>forbidden. What is the reason</b> for this? It is that <b>they came from</b> the outside <b>world,</b> i.e., the animal must have swallowed them along with vegetation, in which case these worms were already included in the prohibition: “Every swarming thing that swarms on the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten.”
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this: If they came from</b> the outside <b>world, they should be found in the digestive tract</b> as well. Since they are found only in non-digestive organs, they must have originated in the animal and should not be considered creeping animals that swarm on the earth.
<b>Some state</b> the exchange differently: <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, says: <i>Kukeyanei</i> are permitted. What is the reason</b> for this? It is that <b>they originate from</b> inside the animal. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> This is <b>obvious, as if they came from</b> the outside <b>world, they should be found in the digestive tract.</b>
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is: <b><i>Kukeyanei</i> are forbidden. What is the reason</b> for this? It is that the animal <b>sleeps, and worms enter it through its snout.</b> From there they travel to the internal organs without passing through the digestive tract. <b>Worms</b> found in <b>meat</b> between the skin and the flesh <b>are forbidden;</b> those found in <b>fish are permitted.</b>
The Gemara recounts: <b>Ravina said to his mother: Conceal</b> the fish’s worms inside it so I cannot see them, <b>and I will eat</b> the fish. <b>Rav Mesharshiyya, son of Rav Aḥa, said to Ravina: What is different</b> in this case <b>from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that the verse: <b>“Their carcasses you shall have in detestation”</b> (Leviticus 11:11), serves <b>to include worms that are in animals</b> as forbidden? Why are worms in fish permitted?
Ravina <b>said to him: How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? An animal is rendered permitted</b> for consumption only <b>by slaughter.</b> Before it is slaughtered, it and all its contents are considered part of a living animal and prohibited by the Torah. <b>And since</b> the animal’s <b>slaughter is not effective for these</b> worms, <b>they retain their forbidden</b> status. <b>But fish are rendered permitted by merely gathering</b> them; they are not included in the prohibition against eating a limb from a living animal. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>when these</b> worms <b>originate</b> inside the fish, <b>they originate in a permitted</b> state.
§ The verse states: “Whatever goes upon the belly, and whatever goes upon all fours, or whatever has many feet, even all swarming things that swarm upon the earth, them you shall not eat” (Leviticus 11:42). <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the phrase <b>“goes upon the belly”</b> is referring to the <b>snake.</b> The preceding word <b>“whatever”</b> serves <b>to include</b> the <b>earthworm and</b> animals <b>similar to an earthworm.</b> The phrase <b>“upon all fours”</b> is referring to the <b>scorpion.</b> The preceding phrase <b>“whatever goes”</b> serves <b>to include the beetle and</b> animals <b>similar to a beetle.</b> The phrase <b>“has many feet”</b> is referring to the <b>centipede.</b> The preceding phrase <b>“or whatever”</b> serves <b>to include</b> animals <b>similar</b> to a centipede <b>and</b> animals <b>similar to those similar to</b> it.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei ben Durmaskit says:</b> The <b>leviathan</b> mentioned in the Bible <b>is a kosher fish, as it is stated: “His armor is his pride”</b> (Job 41:7), and: <b>“Sharpest potsherds are under him”</b> (Job 41:22). The phrase <b>“his armor”</b> is referring to <b>his scales,</b> which protect him like armor. The phrase <b>“sharpest potsherds are under him”</b> is referring to <b>fins with which he swims,</b> which are sharp and project from his underside.

Daf 68a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> When a pregnant kosher animal is slaughtered, the slaughter also renders the consumption of its fetus permitted. Even if <b>an animal was encountering difficulty giving birth and</b> meanwhile <b>the fetus extended its foreleg</b> outside the mother animal’s womb <b>and</b> then <b>brought it back</b> inside, and then the mother animal was slaughtered, the <b>consumption</b> of the fetus is <b>permitted</b> by virtue of the slaughter of the mother animal. But if the fetus <b>extended its head</b> outside the womb, <b>even if it</b> then <b>brought it back</b> inside, the halakhic status of <b>that</b> fetus is <b>like</b> that of <b>a newborn,</b> and the slaughter of the mother animal does not permit the consumption of the fetus. Rather, it requires its own slaughter.
If, prior to slaughtering an animal, one <b>severs</b> pieces <b>from a fetus that is in</b> the <b>womb</b> and leaves those pieces in the womb, their <b>consumption</b> is <b>permitted</b> by virtue of the slaughter of the mother animal. By contrast, if one severs pieces <b>of the spleen or of the kidneys</b> of an animal and then slaughters it, then even if those pieces are left inside the animal their <b>consumption</b> is <b>prohibited,</b> because an organ severed from a living being is not permitted by the subsequent slaughter of the animal. <b>This is the principle: An item that is</b> part of an animal’s <b>body</b> that was severed prior to its slaughter is <b>prohibited</b> even after slaughter, <b>and</b> an item <b>that is not</b> part of <b>its body,</b> i.e., its fetus, is <b>permitted</b> by virtue of its slaughter.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara qualifies the first ruling of the mishna: <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: But</b> as for <b>the limb itself,</b> i.e., the foreleg, its consumption is <b>prohibited,</b> even though the fetus brought it back inside prior to the slaughter.
<b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>as the verse states: “And flesh, in the field, a <i>tereifa</i>, you shall not eat”</b> (Exodus 22:30). A <i>tereifa</i> is an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months; its consumption is prohibited even if it is ritually slaughtered. The Gemara interprets the verse as teaching a principle: <b>Once flesh</b> whose permitted status is dependent on being within a certain area, e.g., sacrificial meat within the Temple courtyard, <b>has gone outside of its boundary,</b> i.e., the area in which it is permitted, which the verse describes as being “in the field,” <b>it becomes</b> permanently <b>prohibited,</b> like a <i>tereifa</i>. Likewise, the permitted status of a fetus is dependent on its being within the womb when the mother animal is slaughtered. Accordingly, if any part of the fetus leaves the womb before the slaughter, it is rendered permanently prohibited.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>an animal was encountering difficulty giving birth and</b> as a result <b>the fetus extended its foreleg</b> outside the mother animal’s body <b>but</b> then <b>brought it back,</b> and then the animal was slaughtered, the <b>consumption</b> of the fetus is <b>permitted</b> by virtue of the slaughter of the mother animal. The Gemara assumes: <b>What,</b> is the mishna <b>not referring to</b> the entire fetus, including <b>the limb,</b> i.e., the foreleg, when it states that its consumption is permitted by the slaughter? This would contradict Rav’s ruling. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the mishna is <b>referring to</b> the rest of the <b>fetus,</b> apart from the foreleg.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the mishna is <b>referring to</b> the rest of the <b>fetus, why</b> state <b>specifically</b> that the fetus <b>brought back</b> its foreleg? <b>Even</b> if it did <b>not bring it back</b> the rest of the fetus would still be permitted. The Gemara answers: <b>The same is true,</b> that the rest of the fetus is permitted, <b>even if</b> it <b>did not bring back</b> its foreleg. <b>But since</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>wants to teach</b> in <b>the latter clause:</b> If the fetus <b>extended its head, even though it brought it back,</b> the halakhic status of <b>that</b> fetus is <b>like</b> that of <b>a newborn</b> and is permitted only through its own slaughter, therefore <b>he also taught</b> in <b>the first clause</b> that the fetus <b>brought back</b> its foreleg, for stylistic reasons, despite the fact that the ruling is not limited to that case.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> concerning this <b>latter clause</b> itself, <b>what does it teach us?</b> Does it teach <b>that once</b> the fetus <b>extended its head, that is</b> considered <b>a birth?</b> But <b>we</b> have already <b>learned</b> this in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 46a): <b>Who is</b> considered <b>a firstborn with regard to inheritance but is not</b> considered <b>a firstborn with regard to</b> the requirement to be redeemed by giving five shekels to <b>the priests?</b> It is a son <b>who came after</b> the <b>miscarriage</b> of an underdeveloped fetus. The mishna adds that the category of stillbirth includes the case of a child who did not reach full term, <b>even if its head emerged alive, or</b> a fully developed, <b>nine-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus <b>whose head emerged dead.</b>
The Gemara infers from the final clause of the mishna: <b>The reason</b> a son born following the miscarriage is considered a firstborn with regard to inheritance is <b>that</b> the <b>head</b> of the miscarriage emerged only after it was already <b>dead. But</b> if <b>its head</b> had initially emerged <b>alive,</b> even if it then died before being fully delivered, the son <b>born after him would not be</b> considered <b>a firstborn even with regard to inheritance.</b> Apparently, this is because the emergence of the head alive is considered a birth, and therefore any subsequent child cannot be considered the firstborn. Evidently, it is unnecessary for the mishna here to teach this definition of a birth.
<b>And if you would say</b> that the mishna there <b>teaches us</b> the definition of birth <b>with regard to a person, and</b> the mishna here <b>teaches us</b> that the same definition applies <b>to an animal,</b> another problem remains, as the Gemara will presently explain.
Before explaining the problem with this suggestion, the Gemara explains why it is necessary to teach the definition with regard to both people and animals: <b>Because</b> the definition of birth with regard to <b>a person cannot be derived from</b> that <b>of an animal, as an animal does not have a concealed opening [<i>prozdor</i>]</b> to the womb, unlike women, whose thighs conceal the opening to their womb. Consequently, even if the definition were stated with regard to an animal, one might limit it to animals, as that stage is immediately visible; whereas in women it is not. <b>And</b> conversely, the definition of birth with regard to <b>an animal cannot be derived from</b> that of <b>a person, as the form of</b> a person’s <b>face is significant</b> because people are created in the image of God, and their faces bear the mark of their intelligence, which is not true of animals. Consequently, perhaps the emergence of the head alone is considered a birth only with regard to a person.
The Gemara proceeds to explain why the above suggestion is not a solution: With regard to <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>also,</b> that the emergence of the head of an animal is considered a birth, <b>we</b> have already <b>learned</b> it in a mishna (77a): If <b>part of a placenta emerged</b> from the womb of an animal before it was slaughtered, its <b>consumption</b> is <b>prohibited</b> even after the mother animal is slaughtered. The reason for this is just <b>as</b> the placenta is <b>an indication of</b> the presence of <b>a fetus in a woman, so too,</b> it is <b>an indication of</b> the presence of <b>a fetus in an animal.</b> Consequently, it is possible that the part of the placenta that emerged contained the head of the fetus, and accordingly it would be considered to have been born. The slaughter of the mother animal would therefore not permit it for consumption. Evidently, it is unnecessary for the mishna here to teach the definition of a birth even with regard to an animal.
The Gemara has established that the latter clause does not teach any novelty. Accordingly, it returns to challenging Rav’s ruling: <b>Granted,</b> the mishna is understood <b>if you say</b> that the statement that the fetus <b>brought</b> its foreleg <b>back</b> inside the mother animal, which is mentioned <b>in the first clause</b> of the mishna, is written <b>specifically</b> in order to teach the novelty that the foreleg is permitted if it was brought back before the slaughter, in contrast to Rav’s ruling. If so, then one can claim the mishna <b>taught</b> it in <b>the latter clause due to the first clause,</b> so that they would be parallel stylistically, and no novelty is necessary in the latter clause.
<b>But if you say the first clause</b> is <b>not</b> written <b>specifically</b> and does not teach a novelty, but rather the mishna is referring to the permitted status of the rest of the fetus, which is permitted even if it does not bring back its foreleg, <b>and</b> you also say <b>the latter clause is not</b> written <b>specifically</b> to teach a novelty, since the definition of birth is already taught in a mishna elsewhere, then <b>why does it</b> need <b>to teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the foreleg or head were brought back <b>at all?</b> Perforce, the first clause must be referring to the permitted status of the foreleg and limiting it specifically to the case where it was brought back inside. This contradicts Rav’s ruling.
The Gemara responds: <b>No; actually,</b> the mishna is <b>referring to</b> the permitted status of the rest of the <b>fetus, but</b> nevertheless, the statement that the fetus brought back its foreleg does teach a novelty. This is <b>similar to that which Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said,</b> in explanation of a ruling in a <i>baraita</i> cited below, that it is <b>necessary only with regard to the location of a cut</b> limb on the fetus’s body. If the foreleg were to be severed at precisely the point that lay on the boundary between the inside and the outside of the womb, then the location of the cut on the fetus’s body would also be prohibited. <b>Here too,</b> one can explain that the ruling is <b>necessary only with regard to the location of the cut,</b> and it teaches that if the fetus did not bring back its foreleg, then not only is the foreleg prohibited but the location of the cut is also prohibited.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a challenge to Rav’s ruling from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>an animal was encountering difficulty giving birth,</b> and as a result <b>the fetus extended its foreleg</b> outside the mother animal’s body <b>and then brought it back</b> inside <b>and</b> then <b>afterward one slaughtered its mother,</b> its <b>consumption</b> is <b>permitted</b> by virtue of the slaughter of the mother animal. But if <b>one</b> first <b>slaughtered its mother, and</b> only <b>afterward</b> did the fetus <b>return its</b> foreleg back inside, its <b>consumption</b> is <b>prohibited.</b>
If the fetus <b>extended its foreleg</b> outside <b>and</b> one <b>cut it</b> off, <b>and</b> then <b>afterward one slaughtered its mother,</b> then the part of the foreleg <b>that was outside</b> and was cut off is <b>ritually impure and</b> its consumption is <b>prohibited,</b> as it has the status of a limb cut from a living animal, which is forbidden. <b>And</b> the rest of the fetus <b>that was inside</b> is <b>ritually pure and</b> its consumption is <b>permitted</b> by virtue the slaughter of the mother animal.
If <b>one slaughtered its mother and</b> only <b>afterward cut off</b> the foreleg that had been extended outside,

Daf 68b

then <b>the flesh</b> of both the mother animal and the fetus, excluding the foreleg, is impure due to <b>contact with a carcass.</b> Since the foreleg of the now dead fetus was not permitted through an act of slaughtering, it is regarded as a carcass. It therefore imparts impurity to the rest of the flesh, which was in contact with it. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Although the slaughter of the mother animal does not permit the consumption of the foreleg, it does serve to prevent the foreleg from imparting the ritual impurity of a carcass. Accordingly, the flesh has the status of having been in <b>contact with a slaughtered <i>tereifa</i>.</b> By Torah law, consumption of the animal is prohibited but it does not impart ritual impurity. The Sages decreed it to be impure in that it disqualifies sacrificial flesh with which it comes in contact.
The Gemara explains the challenge to Rav’s ruling: <b>In any event, the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches:</b> If <b>the fetus extended its foreleg</b> outside the mother animal’s body <b>and then brought it back</b> inside <b>and</b> then <b>afterward one slaughtered its mother,</b> its <b>consumption</b> is <b>permitted. What, is it not</b> referring <b>to the limb,</b> i.e., the foreleg, and the <i>baraita</i> rules that it is permitted, in contradiction to Rav’s ruling? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it <b>is referring to</b> the rest of <b>the fetus.</b>
The Gemara questions this: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is referring to</b> the <b>fetus, say the latter clause:</b> If <b>one</b> first <b>slaughtered its mother, and</b> only <b>afterward</b> the fetus <b>returned its</b> foreleg inside, its <b>consumption</b> is <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara explains the question: <b>And if</b> it is referring to the <b>fetus, why</b> should it be <b>prohibited</b> in this case?
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to the fetus, and should be explained in a manner <b>similar to that which Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said,</b> in explanation of a ruling in a <i>baraita</i> cited below, that it is <b>necessary only with regard to the location of the cut</b> limb on the fetus’s body. If the foreleg was severed at precisely the point that lay on the boundary between the inside and outside when it was extended outside the womb, the location of the cut on the fetus’s body is also prohibited. <b>Here too,</b> one can explain that this ruling is <b>necessary only with regard to the location of the cut,</b> and it teaches that if the fetus did not return its foreleg, then not only is the foreleg prohibited but the location of the cut is prohibited as well. The foreleg itself, though, is prohibited even if it was brought back inside before the slaughter.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But when Avimi came from Bei Ḥozai he came and brought a <i>baraita</i> with him:</b> One of the sources (see 69a) that the slaughter of a pregnant animal also serves to permit the consumption of the fetus is the verse: “And every animal that has a split hoof and is cloven into two hooves, chews the cud, of the animals, it you may eat” (Deuteronomy 14:6). The verse mentions both “hoof” in the singular and “hooves” in the plural to teach that sometimes one may eat two hooves and sometimes only one, as follows: If the fetus extended two of its hooves outside the womb, if it <b>returned</b> one <b>hoof one may eat,</b> if it brought back both <b>hooves one may eat. What, is it not</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means that if it <b>brought back</b> one <b>hoof one may eat</b> that <b>hoof,</b> and likewise if it brought back both <b>hooves one may eat</b> both of them, in contradiction to Rav’s ruling?
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it means that if it <b>brought back</b> one <b>hoof</b> or even both, <b>one may eat</b> the rest of the <b>fetus</b> but not the hooves. The Gemara objects: <b>If</b> it is referring to the permitted status of the <b>fetus, why does it specifically</b> state that it <b>brought back</b> the hoof? <b>Even</b> if it did <b>not bring</b> it <b>back</b> the fetus would be permitted. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>necessary only with regard to the location of the cut</b> limb on the body of the fetus. If the limb were to be severed at precisely the point that lay on the boundary between the inside and the outside when it was extended outside the womb, then the location of the cut on the fetus’s body would also be prohibited, but only if the fetus had not brought back that limb before the mother animal was slaughtered.
The Gemara persists: <b>But</b> even given Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s claim the <i>baraita</i> <b>adduces two verses,</b> i.e., the mention of hoof and hooves. <b>What, is it not</b> that <b>one</b> serves <b>to</b> permit the <b>limb,</b> in contradiction to Rav’s ruling, <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> serves <b>to</b> permit the <b>location of the cut,</b> in accordance with Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s ruling? The Gemara responds: <b>No; one</b> mention does serve <b>to</b> permit the <b>location of the cut, but</b> the other <b>one</b> serves <b>to</b> permit a fetus with <b>non-cloven hooves [<i>kalut</i>]</b> found <b>inside the womb of a cow</b> that was slaughtered. Although the fetus does not bear the distinguishing characteristics of a kosher species, it is nevertheless permitted by virtue of the slaughter of its mother.
<b>And</b> it is necessary to have a specific source to permit this <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, as Rabbi Shimon says:</b> A calf with <b>non-cloven hooves born from a</b> kosher <b>cow</b> is <b>forbidden,</b> as the calf does not bear the distinguishing characteristics of a kosher species. The verse teaches that <b>this matter</b> applies only <b>where</b> the fetus <b>emerged into the airspace of the world,</b> i.e., it was born before the mother animal was slaughtered. <b>But</b> if it was still <b>inside its mother’s womb</b> when the mother was slaughtered, it is permitted.
§ The Gemara attempted to challenge Rav’s ruling that once a limb of a fetus is extended outside the mother animal’s body it becomes prohibited even if it was then brought back, but did not find a conclusive refutation. It now presents a dissenting opinion: <b>Ulla</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And</b> even the <b>limb itself is permitted</b> by virtue of the slaughter of the mother animal.
<b>Rav Yehuda said to Ulla: But Rav and Shmuel both say</b> the <b>limb itself is prohibited;</b> how can you say otherwise? Ulla <b>said to him: Who will give us</b> some <b>of the dust of</b> the graves of <b>Rav and Shmuel and we will fill our eyes</b> with it; such is the greatness of those Sages. <b>But</b> I follow the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, and <b>this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Initially one would assume <b>all</b> flesh that is permitted due to being within a certain boundary, e.g., a fetus inside its mother’s womb, the flesh of offerings of the most sacred order within the Temple courtyard, and the flesh of offerings of lesser sanctity within Jerusalem, <b>was included</b> in the verse: <b>“And flesh, in the field, a <i>tereifa</i>, you shall not eat”</b> (Exodus 22:30). The verse is interpreted to teach that if such flesh leaves its boundaries it is rendered forbidden, even should it subsequently return.
<b>Once</b> another <b>verse applies</b> the concept <b>for you specifically with regard to a sin offering,</b> teaching <b>that</b> if it <b>went outside of its boundary and returned</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> (see Leviticus 10:18), then it is apparent <b>that the Merciful One specifically applied</b> the concept <b>to a sin offering. But</b> with regard to <b>all</b> other <b>items</b> that left their boundary, <b>once</b> they are <b>brought back</b> they are <b>permitted,</b> including the limb of a fetus that was extended outside the womb and then was brought back.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Ulla and Rabbi Yoḥanan from a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse: <b>“And flesh, in the field, a <i>tereifa</i>, you shall not eat,”</b> that flesh that leaves the boundary in which it is permitted is thereby rendered forbidden like a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> that it is like a <i>tereifa</i>? The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>Since we find with regard to second tithe and first fruits that even though they went outside of their boundary,</b> which is the city of Jerusalem and the only place where it is permitted to eat them, nevertheless if they <b>are brought back</b> to there <b>they are</b> once again <b>permitted,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought <b>that also</b> with regard to <b>this</b> prohibition, that of flesh that leaves its boundary, <b>it is so,</b> i.e., if it is brought back it once again becomes permitted for consumption. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “A <i>tereifa</i>.”</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> from the term “a <i>tereifa</i>”? <b>Rabba said:</b> The verse indicates that the prohibition of flesh that left its boundary is <b>like</b> the prohibition of <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Just as</b> with regard to <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, once</b> an animal <b>is mortally wounded,</b> rendering it a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>it can no longer regain a permitted status, so too</b> with regard to <b>flesh</b> referred to in the verse: <b>Once it has gone outside of its boundary it can no longer regain permitted</b> status. Accordingly, if the limb of a fetus was extended outside the womb it would thereby become permanently prohibited, contradicting the opinion of Ulla and Rabbi Yoḥanan. The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation of</b> the statement of <b>Ulla</b> is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>, which states: <b>The Master said: Since we find with regard to second tithe and first fruits</b> that although they left their boundary, if they are brought back there they are again permitted. The Gemara asks: <b>Where did we find</b> this, i.e., what is the source for this <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara explains <b>that it is written: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain,</b> or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows that you have vowed, nor your voluntary offerings, nor the offering of your hand. But you shall eat them before the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 12:17–18). The phrase “the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil” is referring to second tithe, and the phrase “the offering of your hand” is referring to first fruits. The verse states that all the items listed may be eaten only “before the Lord your God,” i.e., within the city of Jerusalem. The prohibition stated in the verse is that <b>within your gates,</b> i.e., outside of Jerusalem, <b>you may not eat</b> these items. <b>But</b> by inference, if these items <b>went outside of their boundary,</b> i.e., outside of Jerusalem, <b>and</b> then <b>were brought back, they are permitted.</b>
§ The Gemara explained the dispute between Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan in the way in which it was taught in Babylonia. The Gemara notes that <b>in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they taught</b> the dispute <b>like this: Rav says there is</b> a concept of <b>birth with regard to limbs.</b> When a limb is extended outside the womb, it is considered born and is independent of the mother animal. Consequently, it can never be permitted by virtue of the slaughter of the mother animal. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>there is no</b> concept of <b>birth with regard to limbs.</b> Since the limb is never considered to have been born, as long as it is inside the mother animal when the mother animal is slaughtered it will be permitted by virtue of that slaughter.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> these two versions which explain why Rav deemed the limb forbidden? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between</b> them is in a case in which only the majority of a limb was extended outside the womb. In that case, the issue is whether or not <b>to prohibit the minority of</b> the <b>limb that</b> remained <b>inside.</b> If the limb is forbidden because it is considered to have been born, the entire limb would be forbidden and not just the part that was extended. If the limb is forbidden because it left its boundary, then only the part that extended outside the womb would be forbidden.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>According to the statement of the one who says there is no</b> concept of <b>birth with regard to limbs,</b> if <b>the fetus extended its foreleg</b> outside the womb <b>and brought it back, and again it extended its</b> other <b>foreleg</b> outside <b>and brought it back,</b> and continued to extend parts of its body outside <b>until</b> the total amount that had been outside the womb <b>constituted the majority of</b> the fetus, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that ultimately the <b>majority</b> of the fetus <b>has left</b> the womb and the entire fetus should be regarded as having been born, and consequently the slaughter of its mother can no longer permit its being consumed? <b>Or perhaps, since it brought</b> each limb <b>back,</b> the limbs are considered to have been <b>brought back;</b> therefore, the majority of the fetus is not considered to have left the womb and it is not regarded as having been born. In that case, the slaughter of its mother would still permit its being consumed.
The Gemara asks: <b>If you want to say</b> that <b>since it brought back</b> each limb, they are considered to have been <b>brought back</b> and the majority of the fetus is not considered to have left the womb, the following dilemma still arises: If the <b>fetus extended its foreleg</b> outside <b>and</b> someone <b>severed it, and again it extended its</b> other <b>foreleg</b> outside <b>and</b> someone <b>severed it,</b> and this continued with its other limbs <b>until</b> the total amount outside the womb <b>constituted the majority of</b> the fetus, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that since the <b>majority</b> of the fetus <b>has left</b> the womb, the entire fetus should be regarded as having been born and therefore the slaughter of its mother can no longer permit it? <b>Or perhaps,</b> in order for the fetus to be regarded as having been born <b>we require a majority</b> of the fetus to leave <b>simultaneously,</b> which does not exist in this case.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna:

Daf 69a

<b>This is the principle: An item that is</b> part of an animal’s <b>body</b> that was severed prior to the slaughter is <b>prohibited</b> to be consumed even after slaughter, <b>and</b> an item <b>that is not</b> part of <b>its body,</b> i.e., its fetus, is <b>permitted</b> by virtue of its slaughter. The Gemara asks: Just prior to stating the principle, the mishna states the <i>halakha</i> that even if parts of a fetus are cut from it the slaughter of the mother permits it. If so, when the mishna presents the principle and states that an item <b>that is not</b> part of <b>its body</b> is permitted, <b>what is added?</b> Is it <b>not to include a case like this,</b> where the majority of the fetus has already left the womb, and nevertheless the principle clarifies that the rest of the fetus that remains inside the womb is permitted?
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, it comes to include</b> a fetus with <b>non-cloven hooves</b> found <b>inside the womb of a cow</b> that was slaughtered. Although the fetus does not bear the hallmarks of a kosher animal, which has split hooves and chews its cud, it is nevertheless permitted to be consumed by virtue of the slaughter of its mother. <b>And</b> a specific clause in the mishna permitting this is necessary <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, as Rabbi Shimon says:</b> A calf with <b>non-cloven hooves born from a</b> kosher <b>cow</b> is <b>forbidden,</b> as the calf does not bear the hallmarks of a kosher animal. The mishna teaches that <b>this matter</b> applies only <b>where</b> the fetus <b>emerged into the airspace of the world,</b> i.e., it was born before the mother animal was slaughtered. <b>But</b> if it is still <b>inside its mother’s womb</b> when the mother is slaughtered, it is permitted to be consumed.
§ The Gemara taught that the reason to deem a limb of a fetus that was extended outside the womb forbidden for consumption is because it went outside of its boundary. Based on this, <b>Rav Ḥananya raises a dilemma:</b> If the <b>fetus</b> of a sacrificial animal of the most sacred order <b>extended its foreleg</b> outside the womb while <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> and then brought it back, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Will the slaughter of the mother permit that limb? Do we say that <b>since</b> the courtyard <b>is</b> regarded as the <b>boundary for</b> such <b>sacrificial</b> animals, as they are permitted only when in the courtyard, therefore <b>it is also</b> regarded as the boundary <b>for this</b> fetus, and even if it extended its limb outside of the womb, it is irrelevant since it ultimately remained within its boundary? <b>Or perhaps, for this</b> fetus, the courtyard <b>is not</b> considered its <b>boundary, as the boundary of a fetus is its mother,</b> and so the limb would become prohibited.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Ḥananya: <b>But</b> why don’t <b>you raise</b> the same <b>dilemma</b> with regard to the fetuses of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> which are permitted only <b>within Jerusalem?</b> Abaye continues: It would appear that concerning <b>offerings of lesser sanctity within Jerusalem, what is the reason</b> that <b>you did not raise</b> this <b>dilemma?</b> It is because it is clear to you <b>that the boundary of a fetus is its mother.</b> But <b>here too,</b> concerning a fetus of an offering of the most sacred order, one must say that <b>the boundary of a fetus is its mother,</b> and not the Temple courtyard.
§ The <i>baraita</i> cited on 68b discusses the case of a fetus that extended a limb outside the womb. It cites the opinion of the Rabbis that although the slaughter of the mother does not permit the consumption of the limb, it does prevent it from being defined as a carcass with the associated ritual impurity. Based on this, <b>Ilfa raises a dilemma: If</b> the <b>fetus extended its foreleg</b> outside the womb <b>between</b> the severing of its mother’s windpipe, which is <b>one of the organs that must be severed in ritual slaughter [<i>siman</i>],</b> and the severing of the other <b><i>siman</i>,</b> the gullet, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
<b>Does</b> the cutting of the <b>first <i>siman</i> combine with</b> that of <b>the second <i>siman</i> to render</b> that limb <b>pure from</b> the impurity of <b>a carcass or not?</b> The cutting of the first <i>siman</i> could potentially permit the consumption of the limb, as the limb was still inside the womb, whereas the cutting of the second <i>siman</i> could not permit consumption, as the limb had already been extended outside the womb. Since they have different effects, can they combine to render the limb pure? <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> the cutting of the <b>first <i>siman</i> was effective to</b> the extent that it can combine with the cutting of the <b>second <i>siman</i> to permit</b> the rest of the fetus <b>for consumption, will it not be effective</b> with regard to the limb <b>to render it pure from</b> the impurity of <b>a carcass?</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If a fetus extended a limb outside the womb, thereby rendering the limb forbidden, and then, after the mother animal was slaughtered, the fetus emerged alive, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>concerning</b> whether there is a need <b>to be concerned with regard to</b> any <b>offspring of</b> that fetus, i.e., that the prohibition pertaining to its limb will pass on to its offspring?
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say</b> the dilemma applies to the offspring in a case <b>where</b> the fetus matured and <b>mated with a full-fledged,</b> normal <b>animal,</b> which would be fully permitted if slaughtered, then <b>why</b> raise this dilemma <b>specifically</b> with regard to <b>this</b> fetus, <b>which has a prohibition</b> attached to it caused <b>by leaving</b> its boundary?
<b>Even</b> in the case of <b>a regular fetus that emerged alive from its mother’s womb after the mother was slaughtered [<i>ben pekua</i>],</b> which is permitted without the need for any slaughter, the dilemma could <b>also</b> be raised, <b>as Rav Mesharshiyya says: According to the statement of the one who says</b> that when defining the status of an animal <b>one</b> needs <b>to be concerned with its paternity</b> and not only its maternity, if <b>a <i>ben pekua</i> mated with a full-fledged animal, the offspring has no rectification.</b> The offspring of two <i>ben pekua</i> animals is permitted without ritual slaughter. But if the father is a <i>ben pekua</i> but not the mother, then it is simultaneously defined as requiring slaughter, based on the mother, and being excluded from the possibility of being permitted through slaughter, based on the father. Therefore, no act of slaughter can permit it.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the dilemma does not concern that case. Rather, it is <b>necessary</b> in a case in <b>which</b> the fetus later <b>mated with a <i>ben pekua</i> like it</b> and had offspring. Since neither of the parents require slaughter, the offspring does not require it either. In such a case, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? To what extent does the prohibition pertaining to the limb of the father pass to the offspring? Do we say that each <b>limb</b> of the father <b>produces</b> the corresponding <b>limb</b> in the offspring, <b>and</b> so only the parallel limb in the offspring is prohibited, <b>and</b> therefore <b>one</b> could <b>sever</b> that limb <b>and</b> the rest of the offspring will be <b>permitted? Or perhaps</b> the father’s <b>seed is intermingled</b> through the entire offspring, and so the entire offspring is prohibited.
After raising this dilemma, Rabbi Yirmeya <b>then said:</b> It is <b>obvious that the seed of</b> the father <b>is intermingled</b> through the entire offspring, <b>as if</b> it were <b>so</b> that each limb produces the corresponding limb, every <b>blind</b> father would <b>bear blind</b> offspring, <b>and an amputee</b> father would <b>bear</b> offspring that is <b>an amputee.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious that the seed of</b> the father <b>is intermingled, and this is</b> the <b>dilemma we are raising:</b> Even with regard to <b>a regular animal,</b> is it <b>not produced from the influence of</b> the forbidden <b>fat and blood</b> of its father and mother, <b>and</b> yet it <b>is permitted</b> to be consumed? <b>Here too,</b> it <b>is no different,</b> and although the forbidden limb of the father was an influence in the offspring’s formation, the offspring should nevertheless be permitted. <b>Or perhaps we say</b> that the Torah permitted these <b>two prohibitions,</b> the consumption of forbidden fat and the consumption of blood, but <b>we do not say</b> that it permitted <b>three</b> prohibitions, i.e., also the prohibition of a limb that left its boundary.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to whom</b> is it possible to speak of three prohibitions in order to raise this dilemma? <b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> that is difficult, because he holds that a fetus that has completed its gestational term is regarded as being independent of its mother and is no longer permitted by virtue of its mother’s slaughter. Consequently, <b>there is a prohibition of</b> forbidden <b>fat and blood,</b> just like any other animal, <b>but there is no prohibition of</b> a limb that <b>leaves</b> its boundary, as its permitted status is no longer dependent on being within its mother’s womb.
And <b>if</b> you say it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that is also difficult, because he holds that since ultimately the offspring was inside its mother’s womb when the mother was slaughtered, the fetus is permitted in its entirety by virtue of that slaughter. Consequently, <b>there is a prohibition of</b> a limb that <b>leaves</b> its boundary, <b>but there is no prohibition of</b> forbidden <b>fat and blood.</b>
The Gemara cites the source of the opinions of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda: <b>As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The prohibition of the <b>sciatic nerve applies to the fetus</b> that had already completed its gestational term when its mother was slaughtered, <b>and</b> likewise <b>its fat is forbidden;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the prohibition of the <b>sciatic nerve does not apply to the fetus, and its fat is permitted.</b> Evidently, according to all opinions, both the prohibitions of forbidden fat and blood and the prohibition of a limb that leaves its boundary cannot apply to the same animal.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>we do not say</b> that <b>any</b> item that is produced <b>from the influence of</b> a forbidden entity is itself forbidden, <b>as</b> in fact <b>it is permitted.</b> Therefore, it would certainly be permitted to consume the offspring of a fetus whose limb had been forbidden, and the dilemma does not concern such an animal.
<b>And this is</b> the <b>dilemma</b> that <b>we are raising: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to drinking</b> the <b>milk</b> of a fetus whose limb is forbidden? <b>Isn’t regular milk</b> of a normal animal <b>comparable to a limb from a living</b> animal, given that it is taken from a live animal, <b>and</b> yet it <b>is permitted?</b> If so, <b>this</b> milk <b>too</b> should be <b>no different,</b> and although the milk comes from an animal whose limb is forbidden as a limb from a living animal, as it was not permitted through the slaughter of its mother, nevertheless, the milk should be permitted.
<b>Or perhaps there,</b> with regard to regular milk, the Torah waives the prohibition of a limb from a living animal, <b>as there is a rectification for its prohibition through slaughter.</b> But <b>here,</b> with regard to a fetus whose limb is forbidden as a limb from a living animal, <b>there is no rectification for its prohibition through slaughter.</b> The Gemara accepts that this was the dilemma, but concludes that no resolution for it was found, and so the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna states: If, prior to slaughtering an animal, one <b>severed</b> pieces <b>from a fetus</b> that is in its womb, leaving those pieces in the womb, their consumption is permitted by virtue of the slaughter of the mother animal. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “And every animal that has a split hoof</b> and is cloven into two hooves, chews the cud, of the animals, it you may eat” (Deuteronomy 14:6). The term “of the animals [<i>babehema</i>]” is translated literally as: In the animal, and is referring to the term “every animal” mentioned at the beginning of the verse. Accordingly, the verse may be read as saying: Every <b>animal in the animal</b> you may eat, and is referring to a fetus inside its mother. It therefore serves <b>to include the offspring,</b> i.e., the fetus, as being permitted by its mother’s slaughter, even if parts of the fetus had been severed.
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> that the phrase: Every animal of the animals, is referring to a fetus, then one should be able to <b>substitute</b> a non-sacred animal <b>for</b> the sanctified fetus of a pregnant offering, i.e., the non-sacred animal should become consecrated through the attempt to do so. This is because the verse referring to substitution also uses that phrase: “And if he shall substitute an animal for an animal [<i>behema bivhema</i>], it and its substitute shall be consecrated” (Leviticus 27:10). There too, the phrase “an animal for an animal” translates literally as: An animal in an animal.
<b>Why,</b> then, <b>did we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Temura</i> 10a): <b>One cannot substitute limbs</b> of a non-sacred animal <b>for fetuses</b> of pregnant offerings, i.e., those limbs will not thereby be consecrated; <b>and</b> one <b>cannot</b> substitute <b>fetuses</b> of non-sacred animals <b>for limbs</b> of an offering, <b>and</b> one <b>cannot</b> substitute <b>limbs and fetuses</b> of non-sacred animals <b>for whole</b> offerings, <b>and</b> one <b>cannot</b> substitute <b>whole,</b> non-sacred animals <b>for them,</b> i.e., limbs and fetuses of offerings?
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a fetus and its severed pieces are permitted to be consumed by virtue of the slaughter of the mother animal is derived from that which <b>the verse states: “And every animal.”</b> The term “and every” serves <b>to include the offspring,</b> i.e., the fetus, as being permitted, even if parts of it had been severed.
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even</b> if <b>one severs</b> pieces <b>of the spleen or of the kidneys</b> of an animal, those pieces should be permitted <b>as well. Why,</b> then, <b>did we learn</b> in the mishna: If one <b>severed</b> pieces <b>from a fetus that was in</b> its <b>womb,</b> leaving those pieces in the womb, their <b>consumption</b> is <b>permitted</b> by virtue of the slaughter of the mother animal, but if one severed pieces <b>of the spleen or of the kidneys</b> of an animal and then slaughtered it their <b>consumption</b> is <b>prohibited?</b> The Gemara explains: That <b>verse states:</b> “Of the animal, <b>it</b> you may eat,” which indicates that slaughter permits consumption of only the <b>whole</b> animal, <b>but not</b> of the parts of the animal that it is <b>lacking,</b> i.e., the parts that were severed.
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is derived from the term “and every animal,” then even in the case of <b>one who slaughters an animal and finds a dove-shaped</b> fetus <b>in it, it should be permitted. Why,</b> then, <b>does Rabbi Yoḥanan say: One who slaughters an animal and finds a dove-shaped</b> fetus <b>in it,</b> that fetus is <b>prohibited for consumption?</b>

Daf 69b

The Gemara explains: In order for the fetus to be permitted, <b>I require</b> that it have <b>hooves,</b> and a dove-shaped fetus <b>does not have</b> hooves.
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> that the fetus is permitted only if it fulfills the conditions mentioned in that verse, then a fetus with <b>non-cloven</b> hooves found <b>inside a cow’s womb should be forbidden,</b> whereas the <i>baraita</i> cited on 68b states that it is permitted. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is as <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> Each phrase in the verse is taken as a sufficient condition. Furthermore, the term “hoof” can be understood independently of the phrase “cloven into two hooves,” and is referring to a non-cloven hoof. Accordingly, the verse can be interpreted as teaching: An animal that has <b>a hoof, in the animal,</b> it <b>you may eat,</b> and teaches that even a fetus with a non-cloven hoof is permitted.
<b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: Actually,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that the fetus and its severed pieces are permitted <b>should be</b> derived <b>as you</b> previously <b>said,</b> i.e., from the phrase: An animal in the animal. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which posed a difficulty for you,</b> i.e., the mishna in <i>Temura</i> that states <b>one cannot substitute</b> a non-sacred animal for the fetus of a pregnant offering, that difficulty can be resolved by saying: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who compares substitution to</b> the animal <b>tithe: Just as the</b> animal <b>tithe does not apply to limbs and fetuses</b> but only to live animals that can walk, as it is stated: “Whatever passes under the rod” (Leviticus 27:32), <b>so too, substitution does not apply to limbs and fetuses.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do you say</b> that this mishna expresses the opinion of Rabbi Shimon? The Gemara explains: <b>As we learned</b> in the same mishna (<i>Temura</i> 10a) that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: But with regard to consecrated</b> offerings, if <b>one says the leg of this</b> animal <b>is a burnt offering,</b> then <b>all of</b> the animal <b>is</b> consecrated as <b>a burnt offering.</b> Accordingly, <b>even</b> with regard to substitution, if one says: <b>The leg of this</b> non-sacred animal should be substituted <b>instead of that</b> offering, <b>the entire</b> animal <b>should be a substitute in its stead.</b>
Rabbi Yosei clearly disagrees with the opinion that substituting a limb is not possible. But Rabbi Yosei’s formulation indicates that even according to that opinion, if a single limb is consecrated then the entire animal becomes consecrated. The Gemara clarifies: <b>To whom is</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>responding? If we say</b> he is responding <b>to Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, do they accept this reasoning? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that in the case of <b>one who says: The leg of this</b> animal <b>is a burnt offering, all of it will be a burnt offering.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if it is an animal of those that they bring as an offering to the Lord, <b>anything of it that one gives to the Lord, it shall be sacred”</b> (Leviticus 27:9). The verse indicates that the part <b>of it</b> that one gives will be <b>sacred, but all of it</b> will <b>not</b> be <b>sacred.</b>
A non-sacred animal with a consecrated limb may not be sacrificed. Accordingly, one <b>might</b> have thought the consecrated limb may be redeemed and thereby <b>transferred to non-sacred</b> status. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It shall be</b> sacred,” indicating that <b>it shall</b> remain <b>as it is. How</b> is <b>this</b> possible? The animal <b>should be sold for the needs of burnt offerings,</b> i.e., to an individual who will sacrifice the entire animal as a burnt offering, <b>and the payment</b> received <b>for</b> the animal will be <b>non-sacred, except for the payment</b> received in exchange <b>for</b> that one <b>limb</b> that is consecrated. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one who says: The leg of this</b> animal <b>is a burnt offering, all of it becomes a burnt offering? The verse states: “It shall be</b> sacred.” This serves <b>to include all of</b> the animal, indicating that it all becomes sacred.
The Gemara reiterates its question: <b>To whom is</b> Rabbi Yosei responding? Rabbi Yosei clearly disagrees with the opinion that if a single limb is consecrated then the entire animal becomes consecrated. <b>If we say</b> he is responding <b>to Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda, do they accept this reasoning? Rather, isn’t</b> Rabbi Yosei responding <b>to Rabbi Shimon,</b> as the Gemara suggests above in resolution of the difficulty from the mishna in <i>Temura</i>?
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is possible that Rabbi Yosei is not responding directly to any other opinion; rather, <b>he stated his own reasoning,</b> without reference to that of another Sage. Consequently, his statement affords no proof that the mishna in <i>Temura</i> expresses the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Upon its birth, the firstborn male offspring of a domesticated animal is automatically consecrated with firstborn status, and it is prohibited to derive benefit from it. Furthermore, if it dies, it may not be discarded, but must be buried. If <b>an animal that was giving birth to a firstborn male was encountering difficulty giving birth,</b> and in order to alleviate the difficulty one wishes to terminate the birth, <b>he may cut up</b> the fetus <b>limb by limb and cast it to the dogs.</b> Since the fetus was not born, it is non-sacred and does not require burial. If <b>a majority of</b> the fetus <b>had</b> already <b>emerged,</b> it is considered to have been born and is therefore consecrated; consequently, if one cut it up <b>it must be buried, and</b> the mother animal is <b>exempted from</b> having <b>firstborn</b> status conferred on any future offspring.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> An amoraic dispute <b>was stated</b> with regard to a case in which <b>one-third</b> of a firstborn fetus <b>emerged</b> from the womb <b>and</b> then <b>one sold it to a gentile, and then another one-third</b> of the fetus <b>emerged.</b> Once a majority of the fetus emerges it is considered born. The <i>halakha</i> is that a fetus partly owned by a gentile is not consecrated as a firstborn. In this case, the firstborn was sold to a gentile only after it had already partially emerged from the womb. <b>Rav Huna says</b> it is <b>consecrated,</b> while <b>Rabba says</b> it is <b>not consecrated.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav Huna says</b> it is <b>consecrated,</b> as <b>he maintains</b> a firstborn is <b>consecrated retroactively</b> from the moment the first part of its body emerges from the womb. <b>And</b> therefore in this case, <b>once most of it had emerged,</b> it <b>became clarified retroactively that it had</b> already <b>been consecrated from the outset, and</b> so with regard to <b>that which he had sold</b> to a gentile, it arises that <b>he did not</b> actually <b>sell anything</b> at all. Since it had already been consecrated, he did not have full ownership of it to be able to sell it.
<b>Rabba says</b> it is <b>not consecrated,</b> as he <b>maintains</b> a firstborn is consecrated <b>from that point forward,</b> i.e., only at the moment the majority of it emerges. <b>And</b> so with regard to <b>that which he had sold</b> to a gentile, it arises that <b>he had sold</b> it <b>properly,</b> i.e., the sale was valid because at the time of the sale it had not been consecrated. Accordingly, by the time the majority of its body emerged it was already partly owned by a gentile, and that prevented it from being consecrated.
The Gemara notes: Rav Huna and Rabba <b>follow their</b> lines of <b>reasoning, as</b> another dispute between them <b>was stated</b> with regard to a case in which <b>one-third</b> of a firstborn fetus <b>emerged through</b> the <b>wall</b> of the womb, i.e., via caesarean section, <b>and</b> then the other <b>two-thirds</b> emerged <b>through</b> the opening of the <b>womb.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that a fetus is consecrated only if it emerged through the opening of the womb. In this case a majority did emerge through the opening, but the first majority to emerge was not through the opening. <b>Rav Huna says</b> it is <b>not consecrated</b> and <b>Rabba says</b> it is <b>consecrated.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: When <b>Rav Huna says</b> it is <b>not consecrated Rav Huna</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says</b> a firstborn is <b>consecrated retroactively,</b> since the birth consecrates it. <b>And</b> in this case, <b>the first majority</b> that emerged, which defined its birth, was <b>not through</b> the opening of <b>the womb.</b> Therefore, it was not consecrated. Conversely, when <b>Rabba says</b> it is <b>consecrated Rabba</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says</b> a firstborn is <b>consecrated from that point forward,</b> i.e., only once a majority of the fetus has emerged from the opening of the womb. This is because the emergence of a majority of the fetus through the opening of the womb consecrates it, even if that is not the first majority, <b>and</b> in this case <b>the majority</b> of the animal <b>emerged through</b> the opening of the <b>womb.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to convey Rav Huna and Rabba’s dispute in both of these cases. <b>As, had</b> the Sages <b>taught us</b> only their dispute <b>with regard to this</b> case, where after one-third emerged it was sold to a gentile, one might have thought that it is only <b>with regard to this</b> case that <b>Rav Huna says</b> the animal is consecrated retroactively. This is <b>because</b> to rule it is consecrated from that point forward <b>would be a leniency,</b> as then the fetus would be exempt from being subject to firstborn status. <b>But with regard to that</b> case, when one-third emerged through the wall of the womb, <b>where</b> Rabba’s opinion would lead to <b>a stringency,</b> one might <b>say</b> that Rav Huna <b>concedes to Rabba.</b>

Daf 70a

<b>And</b> if their dispute <b>was stated</b> only <b>with regard to that</b> case, when one-third emerged through the wall of the womb, one might have thought it is only <b>in that</b> case that <b>Rabba says</b> the animal is consecrated from that point forward, as that results in a stringency, i.e., the fetus is subject to firstborn status. <b>But in this</b> case, when after one-third emerged it was sold to a gentile, and where ruling that the animal is consecrated from that point forward results in a leniency, one might <b>say</b> that Rabba <b>concedes to Rav Huna.</b> Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> for the dispute to be stated in both cases.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with the opinion of Rav Huna. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>an animal that was giving birth to a firstborn male was encountering difficulty giving birth,</b> and in order to alleviate the difficulty one wishes to terminate the birth, <b>he may cut up</b> the fetus <b>limb by limb and cast it to the dogs. What, is it not</b> teaching that <b>one cuts</b> each limb <b>and leaves</b> it outside the body, casting the limbs to the dogs only after he has already extracted a majority of its body? <b>And if you say</b> a firstborn is <b>consecrated retroactively,</b> then once the majority of the fetus emerges from the womb all of the limbs would be consecrated retroactively according to Rav Huna. Accordingly, the mishna <b>should have</b> said the limbs <b>must be buried.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>No, here we are dealing with one who cuts</b> each limb <b>and</b> immediately <b>casts</b> it to the dogs, before any consecration takes effect.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this, if <b>one cuts</b> the limbs <b>and leaves</b> them, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Each one <b>must be buried.</b> If that is so, <b>rather than teaching in the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If <b>a majority of</b> the fetus <b>had</b> already <b>emerged</b> it is considered to have been born and duly consecrated, and so if one cut it up <b>it must be buried, and</b> any future offspring from that animal <b>is exempted from firstborn</b> status; <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> instead <b>distinguish and teach</b> a case in which the limbs are consecrated <b>within the</b> context of the first case <b>itself,</b> in the following manner: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that the limbs may be cast to the dogs, <b>said?</b> It is <b>with regard to one who cuts</b> pieces of the fetus <b>and</b> immediately <b>casts</b> them to the dogs <b>limb by limb,</b> before a majority has emerged. <b>But</b> if <b>one cuts and leaves</b> the limbs until a majority has emerged, each one of them <b>must be buried.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>That is indeed what</b> the latter clause of the mishna <b>is saying: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is <b>with regard to one who cuts and casts</b> the limbs to the dogs before a majority emerges. <b>But</b> if <b>one cuts and leaves</b> the limbs until a majority emerges it is <b>regarded as though a majority of it emerged</b> at one time, <b>and</b> so <b>it must be buried.</b>
§ <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> Does <b>one follow the majority with regard to limbs or</b> does <b>one not follow the majority with regard to limbs?</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this dilemma; what exactly is Rava’s question?
<b>If we say</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the <b>majority</b> of the fetus <b>emerged,</b> but that majority <b>includes</b> the emergence of the <b>minority</b> part <b>of</b> one of its <b>limbs,</b> then Rava is <b>raising the</b> following <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>this minority</b> part of a limb <b>that is outside</b> the womb, do <b>we cast it,</b> i.e., count it, together <b>with</b> the <b>majority of</b> that <b>limb,</b> which is still inside the womb, as if the entire limb was still inside the womb? If so, it would be regarded as though a majority of the fetus has not yet emerged. <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>we cast it</b> and count it together <b>with the majority of the fetus</b> that has already emerged, and so it is regarded as though a majority of the fetus has emerged and it is duly consecrated.
The Gemara rejects this possibility: In that case it is <b>obvious that we do not disregard the majority of</b> the <b>fetus and go after the majority of</b> the <b>limb.</b> Consequently, Rava would not have raised a dilemma about this.
<b>Rather,</b> the dilemma is referring to a case <b>where half of</b> the fetus <b>emerged,</b> but that half <b>includes the majority of</b> a certain <b>limb, and</b> Rava <b>raises the</b> following <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>this minority</b> part of a limb <b>that is inside</b> the womb, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as <b>to</b> whether <b>one casts it</b> and counts it together <b>with the majority of</b> that <b>limb</b> and considers it as if that entire limb has emerged? If it is counted, it would be regarded as though a majority of the fetus has emerged, and it is duly consecrated.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a statement of the mishna: If <b>a majority of</b> the fetus <b>had</b> already <b>emerged,</b> it is considered to have been born and duly consecrated, and so if one cut it up <b>it must be buried.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>a majority of</b> the fetus? <b>If we say</b> it means <b>literally the majority of</b> the fetus, then the following difficulty arises: <b>Until now had we not learned</b> the principle that <b>the majority</b> of an item is considered <b>like all</b> of <b>it?</b> This is a well-established principle and it is not necessary to teach it again in this context.
<b>Rather, is</b> the mishna <b>not</b> referring to a case <b>where half of</b> the fetus <b>emerged,</b> but that half <b>includes the majority of a limb?</b> If so, the mishna directly resolves Rava’s dilemma and teaches that the minority part of the limb inside the womb is regarded as though it had emerged.
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the mishna could be referring to a case <b>where</b> the <b>majority of</b> the fetus <b>emerged,</b> but that majority <b>includes</b> the emergence of the <b>minority of a limb, and it teaches us that we do not disregard the majority of</b> the <b>fetus and go after the majority of</b> the <b>limb.</b>
§ A firstborn animal is consecrated by virtue of the fact that its birth is the first in which the womb of the mother opens, as indicated by the verse: “Consecrate to Me every firstborn, that which opens the womb” (Exodus 13:2). Concerning this condition, <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>one wrapped</b> the fetus <b>in</b> the <b>bast</b> of a palm tree while it was still in the womb, and it therefore did not come in contact with the opening of the womb directly when it emerged, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether it is consecrated? Likewise, if one wrapped it <b>in his robe</b> when it emerged, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
Rava adds: If it emerged wrapped <b>in its afterbirth, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara interjects: How could one suggest that being wrapped <b>in its afterbirth</b> would pose a problem? <b>That is its</b> natural <b>manner</b> of birth, and the afterbirth is consequently not considered an interposition. Accordingly, it is considered as though it was in direct contact with the opening of the womb. <b>Rather,</b> Rava’s dilemma must be as follows: If it emerged wrapped <b>in</b> the <b>afterbirth</b> of <b>a different</b> animal, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
Another dilemma: If one <b>wrapped it</b> in one’s hands <b>and held it and brought it out</b> in that fashion, such that the fetus did not come in direct contact with the opening of the womb, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? With regard to all these dilemmas the Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> the fetus <b>had</b> already partially <b>emerged headfirst</b> and then one wrapped up the body, which was still inside the womb, the <i>halakha</i> in such a case is clear: Since its head emerged, it is already considered to have been born and to have <b>opened up</b> the womb, and it is duly consecrated. <b>Rather,</b> the dilemma is in a case <b>where it</b> partially <b>emerged hind legs first,</b> and the majority of the body, which was still in the womb, was wrapped before it emerged.
Rava raises additional dilemmas: If <b>a weasel</b> entered the womb and <b>swallowed</b> the fetus there, <b>and</b> then exited the womb, <b>bringing</b> the fetus <b>out</b> in its stomach, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara interjects: Is there any doubt about a case where the weasel <b>brought</b> the fetus <b>out</b> in its stomach? In such a case it is the weasel that <b>brought it out,</b> and it is certainly not regarded as though the fetus opened the womb. <b>Rather,</b> the dilemma concerns a case where the weasel <b>swallowed</b> the fetus <b>and brought it out, and</b> then <b>brought it</b> back <b>into</b> the womb <b>and vomited it</b> out while inside the womb, <b>and</b> the fetus subsequently <b>emerged of its own accord. What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in this case?
Another dilemma: If <b>one pressed together</b> the openings of <b>two wombs</b> of two animals giving birth to firstborns, <b>and</b> a fetus <b>exited from</b> the womb of <b>this</b> animal <b>and entered</b> the womb of <b>that</b> animal, and then emerged from the womb of the second animal, after which the second animal gave birth to its fetus, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether the fetus of the second animal is consecrated as a firstborn? Is the womb considered to have <b>opened</b> only when <b>its own</b> fetus emerges from inside, but a fetus <b>that is not its own</b> is <b>not</b> halakhically considered to have <b>opened</b> the womb? <b>Or perhaps</b> even a fetus <b>that is not its own</b> is <b>also</b> considered to have <b>opened</b> the womb? The Gemara does not provide a resolution for these dilemmas and concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Aḥa raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>the walls of the</b> opening of the <b>womb opened</b> and widened to such an extent that when the fetus emerged it did not touch them, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the <b>airspace</b> of the opening of the <b>womb consecrate</b> the fetus as it is born, <b>and</b> this situation <b>exists</b> here in this case; <b>or perhaps</b> it is the <b>contact with</b> the opening of the <b>womb</b> that <b>consecrates it, and</b> this situation <b>does not exist</b> here in this case?
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>the walls of the</b> opening of the <b>womb were removed, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara interjects: The <i>halakha</i> in this case is clear, since if <b>they were removed they are not</b> there to consecrate the fetus. <b>Rather,</b> the dilemma is in a case where <b>they were removed</b> from their original place, recessed inside the womb, <b>and</b> as the fetus emerged, the walls <b>lay on its neck.</b> In such a case, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do the walls of the opening of the womb <b>consecrate</b> a fetus only <b>when they are in their</b> natural <b>place,</b> but <b>when they are not in their</b> natural <b>place they cannot consecrate</b> a fetus? <b>Or perhaps when they are not in their</b> natural <b>place they also consecrate</b> the fetus.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira:</b> If <b>the walls of the opening of the womb were thinned [<i>nigmemu</i>]</b> by removing the inner layer, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If the fetus then emerges through them is it consecrated? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: You have touched upon a dilemma that was</b> already <b>raised before us,</b> and that discussion provides the answer to your dilemma. <b>As Rabbi Zeira raised a dilemma, and some say Rabbi Zeira raised</b> that <b>dilemma before Rabbi Asi:</b> If a section of the opening of the womb was cut away, but the <b>standing</b> section, i.e., the part remaining, <b>is greater</b> in size <b>than the breached,</b> removed, section, <b>and</b> the offspring <b>emerged through the breached</b> section; or if the <b>breached</b> section <b>is greater</b> in size <b>than the standing</b> section <b>and</b> the offspring <b>emerged through</b> the <b>standing</b> section, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
Rabbi Zeira explains how this dilemma can resolve Rabbi Yirmeya’s dilemma: That <b>dilemma was raised only with regard to</b> a case where the <b>breached</b> section <b>is greater than the standing</b> section, <b>as there is</b> at least some part of the womb still <b>standing</b> and therefore one can consider the possibility that it could consecrate the fetus. <b>But a dilemma was not raised with regard to</b> case where the walls <b>were thinned,</b> because in that case it is obvious that the fetus is not consecrated, as there is nothing left to consecrate it.

Daf 70b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an animal whose fetus died in its womb and the shepherd reached his hand</b> into the womb <b>and touched</b> the fetus, <b>both in</b> the case of <b>a non-kosher animal and in</b> the case of <b>a kosher animal</b> the fetus does not have the status of an animal carcass that imparts ritual impurity, and the shepherd remains <b>ritually pure. Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: In</b> the case of <b>a non-kosher</b> animal it is <b>impure, and in</b> the case of <b>a kosher</b> animal it is <b>pure.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of the first <i>tanna</i>? Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is apparent through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> being inside <b>its mother is effective to permit it for consumption</b> through the slaughter of its mother even if the fetus was found dead inside the womb, then <b>should</b> being inside its mother <b>not</b> also <b>be effective to render it pure from</b> the impurity of <b>an animal carcass?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a rationale for this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a kosher animal; from where do we</b> derive that the same applies to <b>a non-kosher animal?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>the verse states:</b> “And when a domesticated animal dies, of those that you eat, one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The Gemara interprets the verse as follows: <b>“And when a domesticated animal dies,” this</b> is referring to <b>a non-kosher animal; “of those that you eat,” this</b> is referring to <b>a kosher animal.</b> The verse thereby <b>juxtaposes a non-kosher animal to a kosher animal</b> with regard to imparting impurity of a carcass, and teaches that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>a kosher animal, its fetus</b> that died in its womb is <b>pure,</b> as derived above through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>a non-kosher animal, its</b> dead <b>fetus</b> is <b>pure.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, what is the reason</b> for his ruling? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said that the verse states</b> with regard to non-kosher animals that do not have cloven hooves: <b>“And whatever walks on its paws, among any [<i>bekhol</i>] undomesticated animal [<i>ḥayya</i>] that walks</b> on all fours, they are impure for you; whoever touches their carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:27). Rabbi Yosei HaGelili expounds this verse as follows: Those animals <b>that walk on</b> their <b>paws,</b> i.e., that do not have cloven hooves, which are <b>inside</b> the body of <b>an animal, I rendered impure for you.</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak interprets the term <i>bekhol</i> as meaning: Inside the body of, and the word <i>ḥayya</i> as meaning: A live animal. Accordingly, he understands the verse to be referring to a dead fetus found inside a living animal.
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then a dead fetus with <b>non-cloven</b> hooves found <b>inside a cow should be impure,</b> despite the fact that it is from a kosher species, <b>as it is</b> an animal that <b>walks on</b> its <b>paws</b> that is <b>inside</b> the body of a kosher <b>animal.</b> The Gemara explains: The verse renders impure an animal that <b>walks upon</b> its four <b>paws</b> that is <b>inside</b> an animal <b>that walks</b> on <b>four</b> paws. <b>But this is</b> a case of an animal that <b>walks</b> on <b>four inside</b> an animal that <b>walks on eight.</b> Since the mother cow’s hooves are entirely split into two parts, it actually walks on eight parts and is not the animal referred to by the verse.
The Gemara raises another objection: If that is so, then a dead fetus in the form of <b>a cow,</b> which has eight parts to its legs, <b>inside the womb of a camel,</b> a non-kosher animal with non-cloven hooves, <b>should not be impure, as it is</b> an animal that <b>walks on eight inside</b> an animal that <b>walks on four,</b> and the verse is not referring to it. The Gemara responds that the verse could have stated: <b>Walks upon,</b> but instead states: <b>“And whatever walks upon,”</b> i.e., the addition of the word “whatever” serves <b>to include</b> a dead <b>cow</b> fetus <b>in the womb of a camel,</b> teaching that it is impure.
The Gemara objects: If that is so, then a dead fetus with <b>non-cloven</b> hooves <b>inside the womb of</b> a cow with <b>non-cloven</b> hooves should <b>be impure, as it is</b> an animal that <b>walks on four inside</b> an animal that <b>walks on four,</b> but the <i>halakha</i> is that since the mother is a kosher species, it is pure. The Gemara explains: It is <b>to that</b> end that the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference of <b>Rav Ḥisda is effective,</b> as it renders pure the fetuses of all kosher animals, even if their hooves are not fully cloven.
<b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami objects to this</b> explanation that the verse renders impure only animals that walk on four inside animals that walk on four: If that is so, a dead <b>pig</b> fetus <b>inside the womb of a female pig should not be impure, as</b> a pig has cloven hooves, and so <b>it is</b> an animal that <b>walks on eight inside</b> an animal that <b>walks on eight,</b> and so the verse is not referring to it.
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s opinion is derived <b>from here:</b> The verse states with regard to the sliding-scale offering brought by one who was unaware that he was impure when he ate consecrated food or entered the Temple: <b>“A person who touched anything impure, or the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal, or the carcass of an impure creeping animal,</b> and is guilty, it having being hidden from him that he is impure” (Leviticus 5:2).
The verse presents a difficulty: <b>Does</b> only <b>a carcass of a non-kosher animal impart impurity, and</b> that <b>of a kosher</b> animal <b>not impart impurity?</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that both do. <b>Rather, what is this</b> animal to which the verse is referring? <b>This is a fetus, which</b> if <b>inside a non-kosher</b> animal is <b>impure, and</b> if <b>inside a kosher</b> animal is <b>pure.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And since</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the statement of <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, why do I</b> need the proof <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> from the verse: “And whatever walks on its paws, among any undomesticated animal that walks on all fours” (Leviticus 11:27)? The Gemara explains: <b>Were it not</b> for the derivation of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, I would say</b> that <b>the entire</b> verse expounded by Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>comes to</b> teach only <b>that which Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi derived from it, as cited by the Gemara later on. Rabbi Yitzḥak’s statement <b>teaches us</b> that the verse is also to be expounded as Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak explained.
§ It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan,</b> a student of Rabbi Yishmael, <b>says: I said [<i>namti</i>] to ben Azzai: We learned that a carcass of a kosher domesticated animal imparts impurity</b> from the verse: “And when a domesticated animal dies, of those that you eat, one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). <b>And</b> we learned that <b>a carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal imparts impurity,</b> and <b>that a carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal imparts impurity,</b> from the verse: “A person who touched anything impure, or the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal” (Leviticus 5:2).
But <b>we did not</b> yet <b>learn</b> about <b>a carcass of a kosher undomesticated animal. From where</b> is it derived that it imparts impurity? Ben Azzai <b>said to me</b> that this is derived from the verse: “And <b>whatever walks on its paws, among any undomesticated animal that walks</b> on all fours” (Leviticus 11:27). The inclusive term “among any” serves to include even a carcass of a kosher undomesticated animal among those that impart impurity.
Rabbi Yonatan continues. <b>I said to</b> ben Azzai: <b>But does it state: And any undomesticated animal? Isn’t it stated only: “Among any undomesticated animal”?</b> And as explained earlier, this <b>comes to</b> teach <b>that</b> a dead fetus in the form of any of the animals that <b>walk on</b> their <b>paws inside an undomesticated animal imparts impurity. He said to me: And what does</b> Rabbi <b>Yishmael,</b> your teacher, <b>say about this matter?</b>
<b>I said to him</b> that Rabbi Yishmael derives all these <i>halakhot</i> from the verse: “And when a domesticated animal dies, of those that you eat, one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39), as follows: <b>“And when a domesticated animal [<i>habehema</i>] dies,” this</b> is referring to <b>a non-kosher animal; “of those that you eat,” this</b> is referring to <b>a kosher animal.</b> And <b>we learned</b> that <b>a <i>ḥayya</i> is included</b> in the category of <b>a <i>behema</i>,</b> i.e., the term <i>behema</i> can also refer collectively to both domesticated and undomesticated animals. <b>And</b> likewise, <b>a <i>behema</i> is included</b> in the category of <b>a <i>ḥayya</i>.</b>
Furthermore, <b>a kosher <i>ḥayya</i> is included</b> when the Torah makes reference to <b>a kosher <i>behema</i>,</b> and <b>a non-kosher <i>ḥayya</i> is included</b> when the Torah makes reference to <b>a non-kosher <i>behema</i>.</b>

Daf 71a

And likewise, <b>a non-kosher <i>behema</i> is included</b> in the category of <b>a non-kosher <i>ḥayya</i>,</b> and <b>a kosher <i>behema</i> is included</b> in the category of <b>a kosher <i>ḥayya</i>.</b> Accordingly, although the verse here is referring to a <i>behema</i>, it is understood to be referring collectively to both a <i>behema</i> and a <i>ḥayya</i>, and teaches that the carcasses of both types impart impurity. <b>And</b> upon hearing this, ben Azzai <b>said to me in these words: Woe [<i>ḥaval</i>] unto ben Azzai, who did not serve Rabbi Yishmael.</b>
The Gemara analyzes Rabbi Yishmael’s statement: <b>From where do we</b> derive that according to the Torah, <b>a <i>ḥayya</i> is included</b> in the category of <b>a <i>behema</i>? As it is written: “These are the <i>behema</i> that you may eat: An ox, a sheep,</b> and a goat, <b>a deer, and a gazelle, and a fallow deer,</b> and a wild goat, and an oryx, and an aurochs, and a wild sheep” (Deuteronomy 14:4–5). Despite employing the term “<i>behema</i>,” the verse also lists the deer and the gazelle, which are undomesticated animals. <b>How</b> is <b>this</b> possible? From here it is evident that <b>a <i>ḥayya</i> is included</b> by the Torah in the category of <b>a <i>behema</i>.</b>
<b>From where do we</b> derive that according to the Torah, <b>a <i>behema</i> is included</b> in the category of <b>a <i>ḥayya</i>? As it is written: “These are the <i>ḥayya</i> that you may eat, among all the <i>behema</i> that are on the earth. Whatever parts the hoof”</b> (Leviticus 11:2–3). <b>How</b> is <b>this</b> possible, that the verse mentions a <i>ḥayya</i> and then refers to a <i>behema</i>? This indicates that <b>a domesticated animal is included</b> in the category of <b>a <i>ḥayya</i></b> by the Torah.
The Gemara further clarifies: The principle that <b>a kosher <i>ḥayya</i> is included</b> by the Torah in the category of <b>a kosher <i>behema</i></b> is relevant <b>with regard to</b> the <b>distinguishing characteristics</b> of kosher animals. The Torah states with regard to a domesticated animal that only a species that chews its cud and has cloven hooves is kosher. Nevertheless, this requirement is understood as a reference to both domesticated and undomesticated animals.
The principle that <b>a non-kosher <i>ḥayya</i> is included</b> by the Torah in the category of <b>a non-kosher <i>behema</i></b> is relevant <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition against <b>mating</b> one species with another. The Torah states the prohibition with regard to a <i>behema</i>: “You shall not let your animal [<i>behema</i>] mate with a diverse kind” (Leviticus 19:19). Nevertheless, this is understood as referring to both a <i>behema</i> and a <i>ḥayya</i>.
The principle that <b>a non-kosher <i>behema</i> is included</b> by the Torah in the category of <b>a non-kosher <i>ḥayya</i></b> is relevant <b>with regard to that which Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi taught, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse delineates a case in which one is obligated to bring a sliding-scale offering as an atonement: “A person who touched anything impure, or the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal [<i>ḥayya</i>], or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal [<i>behema</i>], or the carcass of an impure creeping animal, and is guilty, it having being hidden from him that he is impure” (Leviticus 5:2). But the nature of the transgression for which the person requires atonement is not apparent from the verse.
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> Since a domesticated animal is also referred to as a <i>ḥayya</i>, it would be sufficient if <b>I would read,</b> i.e., the verse would write, only the clause about <b>a <i>ḥayya</i>,</b> and I would have known that one who touches a carcass of any non-kosher animal is impure. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is</b> an explicit clause about <b>a <i>behema</i> stated?</b> It serves as the basis for a verbal analogy.
<b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to one who is unaware that he touched an impure item: <b>“Non-kosher <i>behema</i>,” and it is</b> likewise <b>stated below,</b> with regard to one who was aware that he touched an impure item: <b>“Non-kosher <i>behema</i>,”</b> in the following verse: “And when any one shall touch any impure thing, whether it is the impurity of man, or a non-kosher <i>behema</i>, and then eats of the flesh of a peace offering to the Lord, that soul shall be cut off from its people” (Leviticus 7:21). <b>Just as below,</b> the verse is referring to the <b>defiling of sacrificial</b> foods, <b>so too here,</b> the reference is to the <b>defiling of sacrificial</b> foods, and therefore one must bring a sliding-scale offering as an atonement.
The Gemara clarifies the final statement: The principle that <b>a kosher <i>behema</i> is included</b> by the Torah in the category of <b>a kosher <i>ḥayya</i></b> is relevant <b>with regard to</b> the <b>formation</b> of children. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 21a): With regard to a woman <b>who miscarries</b> a fetus that appears to be in the form of <b>a type of <i>behema</i>, <i>ḥayya</i>, or bird, whether</b> it had the form of <b>a non-kosher</b> species <b>or a kosher</b> species, <b>if</b> the fetus is <b>a male,</b> then <b>she observes</b> the periods of impurity and purity required <b>for</b> giving birth to <b>a male.</b>
The mishna continues: And <b>if</b> the fetus is <b>a female,</b> then <b>she observes</b> the periods required <b>for</b> giving birth to <b>a female.</b> After giving birth to a male, a woman is impure for seven days, during which it is prohibited for her to engage in intercourse. During the next thirty-three days she may immerse in a ritual bath at any time, after which she is permitted to engage in intercourse even should she then experience a discharge of uterine blood. Nevertheless, during the entire forty-day period she may not enter the Temple or be in contact with consecrated foods. After giving birth to a girl, the length of each of these periods is doubled to fourteen days and sixty-six days, respectively (see Leviticus 12:2–5).
If the sex of the fetus is <b>unknown, she observes</b> the strictures of a woman who gave birth both <b>to a male and to a female.</b> Accordingly, it is prohibited for her to engage in intercourse for the fourteen days after birth, after which she immerses in a ritual bath. After that she is permitted to engage in intercourse despite any discharge of uterine blood until the fortieth day after birth, i.e., for thirty-three days following the seven days she would have been prohibited from engaging in intercourse if the fetus was male. The prohibition against entering the Temple, however, continues until eighty days have passed from the birth.
This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> The Gemara elsewhere (<i>Nidda</i> 22b) explains that Rabbi Meir derives his opinion from the fact that the term “formation” is used to describe both the formation of man: “Then the Lord God formed man” (Genesis 2:7), and the formation of animals and birds: “The Lord God formed every animal [<i>ḥayya</i>] of the field, and every bird of the air” (Genesis 2:19). Furthermore, he holds that the term “<i>ḥayya</i>” is referring to both domesticated and undomesticated animals, and concludes that a woman observes these periods of purity and impurity if the fetus has the form of any of these types of animals.
<b>And the Rabbis say: Any</b> fetus <b>that is not of human form is not</b> regarded as <b>an offspring</b> with regard to observance of these periods of purity and impurity, and she is permitted to engage in intercourse provided she does not experience a discharge of uterine blood.
§ The Gemara returns to explaining the opinion of the Rabbis, cited in the mishna, who hold that a dead fetus found inside its mother’s womb does not impart impurity, irrespective of whether it is of a kosher or a non-kosher animal. Rabbi Yosei HaGelili disagrees and holds that a dead fetus inside a non-kosher animal imparts impurity. He derives this from the verse: “A person who touched anything impure, or the carcass of a non-kosher <i>ḥayya</i>, or the carcass of a non-kosher <i>behema</i>, or the carcass of an impure creeping animal, and is guilty” (Leviticus 5:2), which is referring only to non-kosher animals. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the Rabbis, why do I</b> need <b>this verse?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>The entire</b> verse <b>comes to</b> teach <b>that which Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi taught in the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier, that the verse obligates one to bring a sliding-scale offering only in cases where one partook of consecrated foods or entered the Temple while in a state of impurity of which one was unaware.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a woman whose fetus died in her womb and</b> the <b>midwife extended her hand</b> into the womb <b>and touched</b> the fetus, <b>the midwife is</b> thereby rendered <b>impure with the seven-</b>day <b>impurity</b> imparted by a corpse, <b>and the woman</b> remains <b>ritually pure until the offspring emerges</b> from the womb.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabba says: Just as</b> a ritually <b>impure</b> item that is <b>encapsulated</b> within a body <b>does not impart impurity</b> to an item that comes in contact with it, <b>so too,</b> a ritually <b>pure</b> item that is <b>encapsulated</b> within a body <b>cannot be rendered impure</b> if it comes in contact with an impure item. For example, if one swallowed a ring that was ritually pure and then entered a tent containing a corpse, the ring would not be rendered impure.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>an encapsulated impure</b> item does not impart impurity? <b>As it is written: “And one who eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes,</b> and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:40), i.e., he must immerse his body and garments in a ritual bath, and he then becomes pure at sunset. <b>Are we not dealing</b> even with a case <b>where one ate</b> from the carcass <b>close to sunset</b> and then immersed? <b>And</b> yet <b>the Merciful One states</b> that he is <b>pure</b> once the sun sets, despite the fact that his stomach still contains pieces of the carcass that have not yet been digested. If so, it is apparent that an encapsulated impure item does not impart impurity.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> it <b>is different there,</b> as with regard to the prohibition against eating a carcass the Torah states: “You shall not eat any carcass; you may give it to the gentile resident who is in your cities” (Deuteronomy 14:21). The juxtaposition of the two parts of the verse teaches that the prohibition is limited to a carcass that is fit to be given to a gentile resident, i.e., it is fit for human consumption. Accordingly, perhaps the carcass that the person ate does not impart impurity, <b>as it is no</b> longer <b>fit for a gentile resident,</b> i.e., it is now unsuitable for human consumption.
The Gemara comments that the effectiveness of the proof depends on whether a carcass can impart impurity to a person despite its not being fit for human consumption: <b>This</b> proof <b>works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says:</b> A carcass imparts impurity to <b>both this,</b> a person, <b>and that,</b> food, even if it is unfit for human consumption, <b>until</b> it is no longer fit <b>for</b> consumption by <b>a dog.</b> According to this opinion the proof is understood <b>well,</b> as the carcass in the person’s stomach still has the ability to impart impurity to him because it is still fit for consumption by a dog. Therefore, it is apparent that the only reason it does not impart impurity is that it is encapsulated within his body.
<b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>bar Padda, who says</b> a carcass has the <b>severe form of ritual impurity,</b> which can impart impurity to people only while it is still fit to be eaten <b>by a gentile resident and</b> it has <b>the light form of ritual impurity</b> even <b>until</b> the point that it is no longer fit for consumption <b>by a dog,</b> this proof is flawed. This is because it is possible the carcass in the person’s stomach does not render him impure simply because it is no longer fit for human consumption. Can one claim that the carcass cannot impart impurity <b>because it is no</b> longer <b>fit for a gentile resident?</b>
<b>Granted that</b> the carcass <b>is not fit</b> to be eaten by someone when it was eaten <b>in his presence,</b> as he is aware that it was swallowed and considers it disgusting to eat a swallowed item, but <b>it is</b> still sometimes <b>fit</b> for a person to eat when it was eaten <b>not in his presence</b> and he is unaware that it had been previously swallowed. This is possible where one consumed a small piece of food and did not chew it prior to swallowing. The Gemara concedes this point and therefore accepts the proof.
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>an encapsulated impure</b> item does not impart impurity. <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>a pure</b> item that is <b>encapsulated</b> within another body <b>cannot be rendered impure</b> if it comes in contact with an impure item?
The Gemara explains: It is derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If an earthenware vessel that is closed with a tightly sealed cover, which does not shield,</b> i.e., prevent, the <b>impure</b> piece of a corpse <b>contained within it from imparting impurity</b> to other items in the same tent as it; the Gemara interrupts the explication of the inference and clarifies: <b>As the Master said:</b> The <b>impure</b> piece of a corpse that is <b>in a tight space;</b> e.g., it is buried in the ground and there is not a handbreadth of hollow space above it, beneath the dirt, <b>breaks through</b> the earth above it <b>and ascends up to the heavens,</b> imparting impurity in that path. The Gemara resumes the explication of the inference: Although the tightly sealed earthenware vessel does not shield the impure item, it <b>does shield a pure</b> item <b>contained within it from being rendered impure</b> (see Numbers 19:15).

Daf 71b

Then with regard to <b>a person, who does shield</b> the <b>impurity</b> of a piece of a corpse <b>contained within him from imparting impurity</b> to other items in the same tent, as the Gemara derived above, <b>is it not logical that he shields a pure</b> item <b>contained within him from being rendered impure?</b>
The Gemara challenges the inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about an earthenware vessel?</b> It is notable <b>in that it cannot become impure through</b> a source of impurity coming in contact with <b>its exterior. Can you say,</b> then, that it is comparable <b>to a person, who can become impure through</b> a source of impurity coming in contact with <b>his exterior?</b> Since here the <i>halakhot</i> concerning impurity of a person are more stringent than those concerning an earthenware vessel, one cannot apply to a person a leniency with regard to an earthenware vessel.
The Gemara responds: <b>Is that to say we are speaking of</b> rendering an item impure through a source of impurity coming in contact with <b>its exterior? We are</b> in fact <b>speaking of</b> where the impurity comes in contact with <b>its interior.</b> For such cases, it is reasonable to compare the case of a person with an earthenware vessel.
The Gemara adds: <b>On the contrary,</b> the contraction of impurity by <b>an earthenware vessel is more stringent</b> than that of a person, <b>as</b> it <b>becomes impure through</b> the presence of a source of impurity in <b>its airspace,</b> even if the source does not touch the vessel itself. By contrast, a person is rendered impure from a source of impurity in his airspace, e.g., in his mouth, only if it actually touches him, and the <i>a fortiori</i> inference remains valid.
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that an impure item <b>encapsulated</b> in a body that entered it <b>from above,</b> i.e., through the mouth, does not impart impurity. <b>From where do we</b> derive that an impure item <b>encapsulated</b> in a body that entered it <b>from below,</b> i.e., through the rectum, also does not impart impurity? The Gemara answers: It is derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if,</b> when the impure item enters <b>from above,</b> through the mouth, <b>which</b> is a place that <b>does not digest</b> the food, the body nevertheless <b>shields</b> the impure item from imparting impurity, then <b>with regard to</b> a case where the impure item enters <b>from below, which</b> is a place that <b>does digest</b> food, <b>is it not logical that</b> the body should <b>shield</b> it from imparting impurity?
The Gemara challenges the basis of the inference: <b>Isn’t digestion performed below only by means of</b> the chewing and digestive functions of the body <b>above?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Even so,</b> the <b>digestion</b> performed <b>below is greater</b> than that performed above.
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that an impure item <b>encapsulated</b> in the body <b>of a person</b> does not impart impurity; <b>from where do we</b> derive that an impure item <b>encapsulated</b> in the body <b>of an animal</b> does not impart impurity? The Gemara answers: It is derived through <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> the body of <b>a person, who can impart impurity</b> even <b>while he is</b> still <b>alive,</b> e.g., if he is a leper or a <i>zav</i>, nevertheless <b>shields</b> the impure item <b>encapsulated</b> inside him from imparting impurity, then with regard to <b>an animal, which does not impart impurity while it is alive, is it not logical that it should shield</b> an impure item <b>encapsulated</b> inside it from imparting impurity?
The Gemara challenges the inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the impurity of <b>a person?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> if he entered a leprous house, in order for his garment to be rendered impure <b>he needs to remain in</b> the <b>leprous house</b> for a minimal period of time (see Leviticus 14:33–53). <b>Can you say,</b> then, that it is comparable <b>to an animal, which does not need to remain in a leprous house</b> for a minimal period of time? Rather, any utensils placed upon it are rendered impure immediately upon its entry. Since here the <i>halakhot</i> concerning impurity of an animal are more stringent than those concerning a person, one cannot necessarily apply to an animal a leniency with regard to a person.
The Gemara responds: When it is stated about <b>an animal that it does not need to remain in a leprous house</b> for a minimal period of time, <b>with regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> was that said? A living animal itself cannot be impure. Perforce, the statement is referring <b>to utensils that are</b> placed <b>upon its back,</b> and they are rendered impure immediately upon entry. But in this regard there is no difference between animals and people: <b>A person as well does not need</b> to remain in the leprous house for a minimal period of time in order to render impure any utensils placed on his back. Rather, they are rendered impure immediately upon entry.
This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 13:9): With regard to <b>one who enters a leprous house with his clothes</b> resting <b>on his shoulders</b> but who is not wearing them in the normal manner, <b>and his sandals and his rings</b> are <b>in his hands,</b> both <b>he and they,</b> the clothes, sandals, and rings, are rendered <b>ritually impure immediately.</b> If <b>he was dressed in his clothes, and his sandals</b> were <b>on his feet and his rings</b> were <b>on his fingers, he</b> is rendered <b>impure immediately</b> upon entering the house, <b>but they,</b> the clothes, sandals, and rings, remain <b>pure until he remains</b> in the house <b>for</b> the time it takes <b>to eat a half-loaf</b> of bread. This calculation is made with <b>wheat bread and not</b> with <b>barley bread,</b> which takes more time to eat than wheat bread. In addition, the calculation is made with regard to one who is <b>reclining, and eating</b> the bread together <b>with a relish</b> usually consumed with bread, which hastens the eating.
§ Rabba stated above that an encapsulated impure item cannot impart impurity and that an item that is ritually pure that is encapsulated within another body cannot be rendered impure. <b>Rava said:</b> Why is this statement necessary? <b>We learn both</b> <i>halakhot</i> in a mishna: <b>We learn</b> about <b>an encapsulated impure</b> item, and <b>we learn</b> about <b>an encapsulated pure</b> item.
Rava elaborates: With regard to <b>an encapsulated impure</b> item, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>as we learned</b> (<i>Mikvaot</i> 10:8): If someone <b>swallowed a ring</b> that was <b>impure</b> due to having been in contact with a corpse, he is thereby rendered impure. To render himself pure <b>he immerses and</b> then <b>he may partake of his <i>teruma</i>,</b> despite the fact that the impure ring is still inside him. The reason this is permitted is that since the ring in encapsulated inside the person’s body it cannot impart impurity. If <b>he vomited</b> out this ring it remains <b>impure,</b> as it was not purified by his immersion, <b>and</b> therefore <b>it renders him impure</b> upon its exit from his body.
Likewise, <b>we learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>an encapsulated pure</b> item cannot be rendered impure, <b>as we learn</b> in the same mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 10:8): If one <b>swallowed a ritually pure ring and</b> then <b>entered a tent containing a corpse,</b> thereby contracting impurity, <b>and</b> then in order to render him pure someone <b>sprinkled</b> upon him the water that is mixed with the ashes of the red heifer, once on the third day <b>and again</b> on the seventh day as required, <b>and</b> then <b>he immersed,</b> thereby completing the purification process; <b>and</b> then <b>he vomited</b> out the ring, the ring <b>is</b> pure <b>as it</b> always <b>was,</b> i.e., it was not rendered impure from the corpse.
The Gemara answers: The cases in the mishna concern the possibility of imparting impurity from the ring to the body within which it is contained and vice versa. But <b>when Rabba was speaking</b> he was referring to imparting impurity from one item to another where both are contained together inside a body, <b>such as where</b> a person <b>swallowed two rings, one impure and one pure,</b> and they came in direct contact with one another. Rabba taught that even in this case the <b>impure</b> ring <b>does not render the pure</b> ring <b>impure.</b>

Daf 72a

The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> what about the mishna’s case of a dead <b>fetus</b> in its mother’s womb, <b>and a midwife</b> who touched it there, <b>which is similar</b> to the case of <b>two</b> swallowed <b>rings, and</b> yet the mishna rules that the <b>fetus renders</b> the midwife <b>impure.</b>
<b>Rabba said: A fetus is different</b> from a ring in this regard, <b>since it will ultimately leave</b> the womb. <b>Rava said</b> in puzzlement: Is that to say that <b>a fetus will ultimately leave</b> the womb, but <b>a ring</b> that someone swallowed <b>will not ultimately leave</b> his body? A ring will certainly be expelled eventually as well. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The scholars <b>of Pumbedita know the reason for this matter, and who</b> is the Sage referred to as the scholars of Pumbedita? It is <b>Rav Yosef.</b>
<b>As Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: This impurity</b> of the midwife in the mishna’s case <b>is not</b> in effect <b>by Torah law; rather,</b> it was decreed <b>by rabbinic law.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> was Shmuel’s intention in emphasizing: <b>It is not</b> in effect <b>by Torah law; rather,</b> it was decreed <b>by rabbinic law?</b> It should have sufficed for him to say simply the impurity is decreed by rabbinic law. The Gemara answers: He said this so <b>that you should not say</b> that the ruling of the mishna is only <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that one who touches a dead <b>fetus in a woman’s womb is impure</b> by Torah law, and that is why the midwife was rendered impure. <b>Rather, even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says</b> that one who touches a dead <b>fetus in a woman’s womb is pure</b> by Torah law, nevertheless, the Sages <b>decreed</b> that a midwife who touches it is <b>impure by rabbinic law.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this decree? <b>Rav Hoshaya said:</b> It is a rabbinic <b>decree lest</b> the <b>fetus extend its head out of the concealed opening</b> of its mother’s womb. If it did, it would be regarded as having been born, and it would then be ritually impure by Torah law. The Sages were concerned that the fetus extended its head and then the head returned inside but the midwife did not notice. Consequently, when she touched the fetus she mistakenly assumed she remained ritually pure. To safeguard against this, the Sages decreed that in any case where she touches the dead fetus, she is ritually impure.
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> the Sages should <b>also</b> decree that the <b>woman</b> herself, who is carrying the fetus, is impure, since she also might not notice that the fetus’s head emerged. The Gemara explains: <b>A woman</b> accurately <b>senses with regard to her own</b> body whether the head of the fetus had emerged. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then <b>she would have said</b> this <b>to the midwife.</b> Why is there a need for a decree? The Gemara answers: Since the mother is <b>distracted</b> by the pain of childbirth, she does not have the presence of mind to warn the midwife.
The Gemara cited a dispute as to whether one who touches a dead fetus in a woman’s womb is ritually impure. It now elucidates that dispute: <b>What</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, and what</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“And whoever in the open field touches</b> one who is slain by the sword, or one who dies on his own, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be impure seven days” (Numbers 19:16). The phrase “in the open field” indicates that one is rendered impure only in a case where he touches an exposed corpse. This serves <b>to exclude</b> one who touches a dead <b>fetus in a woman’s womb</b> from being rendered impure; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This phrase serves <b>to include the grave cover and the grave walls,</b> upon which the cover rests, as sources of impurity that render impure anyone who touches them.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where does <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> derive that <b>the grave cover and the grave walls</b> render one who touches them impure? He <b>learned this <i>halakha</i> through tradition,</b> not from a verse. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Akiva, from where</b> does <b>he</b> derive that a dead <b>fetus in a woman’s womb is impure by Torah law? Rabbi Oshaya said</b> he derives it from <b>the verse</b> that <b>states: “Whoever touches of a corpse, of the life</b> of a person that died, he will be impure” (Numbers 19:13). The term “of the life” can also be interpreted as: Inside the life. <b>What is</b> the case of <b>a corpse that is inside the life of a person? You must say</b> that <b>this is</b> a dead <b>fetus inside a woman’s womb.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yishmael requires</b> that verse <b>to</b> teach about <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of blood that comes from a corpse,</b> meaning <b>that</b> even <b>it imparts impurity</b> like a corpse, <b>as it is stated: “Whoever touches of a corpse, of the life of a person</b> that died” (Numbers 19:13). <b>What is</b> the case of <b>a life of a person that imparts impurity? You must say this</b> is referring to <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood,</b> as blood is regarded as the life force of a person, as the verse states: “For the blood is the life” (Deuteronomy 12:23), and a person requires a minimum of a quarter-<i>log</i> of blood to survive.
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Akiva</b> does not accept this derivation. He conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as he says even a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood that comes from two corpses imparts ritual impurity in a tent</b> to people and other items that are under the same roof. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that a quarter-</b><i>log</i> <b>of blood that came out of two</b> separate <b>corpses</b> also <b>imparts ritual impurity in a tent?</b>
It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the prohibition against priests coming in contact with a dead body: <b>“He shall not come upon any people that are a corpse [<i>nafshot met</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 21:11). The use of the plural form “people [<i>nafshot</i>]” indicates that the blood imparts impurity even if it comes from <b>two people,</b> as blood is referred to as “<i>nefesh</i>” (see Deuteronomy 12:23), and the use of the singular form “corpse [<i>met</i>]” indicates that this blood combines to complete <b>one measure,</b> i.e., the minimum amount of a quarter-<i>log</i> required to impart impurity.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>an animal was encountering difficulty giving birth and</b> as a result <b>the fetus extended its foreleg</b> outside the mother’s womb, <b>and</b> someone <b>severed it and afterward slaughtered the mother</b> animal, <b>the flesh</b> of the fetus is <b>ritually pure.</b> If one first <b>slaughtered the mother</b> animal <b>and afterward severed</b> the foreleg, <b>the flesh</b> of both the mother animal and the fetus are ritually impure due to having been in <b>contact with a carcass.</b> Since the foreleg was not permitted to be consumed through the act of slaughtering, it is regarded as a carcass with the associated ritual impurity. The rest of the flesh, which was permitted to be consumed by the slaughter, was in contact with it and so was rendered ritually impure from it; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The flesh has the ritual impurity of having been in <b>contact with a <i>tereifa</i> that was slaughtered,</b> as the limb is regarded as a <i>tereifa</i> that was slaughtered. By Torah law, although it is prohibited to consume it, it does not impart ritual impurity. Nevertheless, the Sages decreed that a <i>tereifa</i> that was slaughtered, as well as anything that comes in contact with it, is regarded as ritually impure to the extent that it disqualifies sacrificial foods that come in contact with it.

Daf 72b

The Rabbis explain the rationale behind their opinion: <b>Just as we found in</b> the case of <b>a <i>tereifa</i> that its slaughter renders it ritually pure</b> according to Torah law, i.e., ritual slaughter prevents it from having the ritual impurity of a carcass despite not rendering the animal permitted for consumption, <b>so too, the slaughter of</b> the mother <b>animal should render the limb</b> of its fetus that left the womb <b>ritually pure,</b> despite the fact that its consumption is prohibited.
<b>Rabbi Meir said to them: No, if the slaughter of a <i>tereifa</i> renders</b> the body of the animal <b>ritually pure,</b> it is because the slaughter is performed on <b>something that is</b> part of <b>its body,</b> i.e., its throat. Does it necessarily follow that <b>you should</b> also <b>render the limb</b> that left the womb <b>pure,</b> given that it is <b>something that is not</b> part of the mother’s <b>body?</b> Certainly not.
The mishna asks: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a <i>tereifa</i> that its slaughter renders it ritually pure,</b> i.e., prevents it from having the ritual impurity of a carcass? The mishna notes there is a reason to say the slaughter should not render it pure, as one can compare a <i>tereifa</i> with a non-kosher animal: <b>A non-kosher animal is prohibited for consumption; so too, a <i>tereifa</i> is prohibited for consumption.</b> Therefore, conclude: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a non-kosher animal, its slaughter does not render it ritually pure, so too</b> with regard to <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, its slaughter should not render it ritually pure.</b>
The mishna questions the comparison: <b>No, if you said</b> that slaughtering cannot prevent an animal from having the ritual impurity of a carcass <b>in</b> the case of <b>a non-kosher animal, which</b> is distinct in that it <b>did not have a period of</b> potential <b>fitness</b> when slaughtering it could have rendered its consumption permitted, does it necessarily follow that <b>you should</b> also <b>say</b> this <b>in</b> the case of <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, which did have a period of</b> potential <b>fitness?</b> Perhaps, since the animal had a period of potential fitness its slaughter remains effective in preventing it from having the ritual impurity of a carcass.
The mishna rejects this distinction: <b>Take</b> back <b>to yourself</b> this claim <b>that you brought,</b> as it is insufficient. What about a case <b>where</b> an animal <b>was born as a <i>tereifa</i> from the womb,</b> and so it never had a period of potential fitness? For such a case, <b>from where</b> is it derived that its slaughter renders it ritually pure?
The mishna reformulates the distinction: <b>No, if you say</b> that slaughtering cannot prevent a prohibited animal from having the ritual impurity of a carcass <b>with regard to a non-kosher animal, which</b> is distinct in that <b>there are no</b> animals <b>of its kind</b> that are permitted through <b>slaughtering,</b> as the Torah states the concept of slaughtering only with regard to kosher animals, does it necessarily follow that <b>you should</b> also <b>say</b> this <b>with regard to a <i>tereifa</i></b> kosher animal, given <b>that there are</b> other animals <b>of its kind</b> that are permitted through <b>slaughtering,</b> i.e., kosher animals that are not <i>tereifa</i>? Perhaps, since the concept of slaughtering is relevant to that kind of animal it can serve to prevent the animal from having the ritual impurity of a carcass even if the slaughter cannot render it permitted for consumption.
The mishna notes: Based on this reasoning, one must conclude that with regard to <b>an eight-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus that was born <b>alive, slaughter does not render it ritually pure, as there are no</b> animals <b>of its kind</b> that are permitted through <b>slaughtering.</b> The Torah applies the concept of slaughter only with regard to animals that were born full term.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that according to Rabbi Meir, if a foreleg of a fetus emerges from the womb and is severed after the slaughter of the mother, it is regarded as a carcass with the associated ritual impurity. Furthermore, the rest of the fetus from which it was cut is thereby rendered ritually impure through its contact with the foreleg. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> should the rest of the fetus be impure? <b>This is</b> a case of <b>impurity</b> imparted within <b>a concealed area,</b> as the point of contact between the foreleg and the fetus existed when they were still naturally connected to each other. <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>an impure</b> item within <b>a concealed area does not impart impurity.</b> If the two items were in contact in a concealed area and not on an external surface, impurity cannot be imparted from one item to the other. <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning</b> in this regard, as he holds that an impure item within a concealed area does impart impurity?
This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 27:10) concerning ritual impurity imparted by treading: If a person who is ritually impure due to having experienced a bodily emission, such as a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>], sits or leans upon an item that was designated for that purpose, the item is rendered ritually impure due to ritual impurity imparted by treading. The item will then impart impurity to people or utensils that come in contact with it. In the case of a garment that is impure with ritual impurity imparted by treading that was <b>three by three</b> handbreadths in size, i.e., the minimum size to impart such impurity, <b>that was split</b> into smaller pieces, each part is <b>ritually pure with regard to</b> ritual impurity <b>imparted by treading</b> and will no longer impart impurity to people and utensils that come in contact with it.
The mishna continues: <b>But</b> each piece will still have the <b>ritual impurity</b> of having been in <b>contact with</b> an item that imparts ritual impurity <b>imparted by treading.</b> Before the garment was split, when it still imparted ritual impurity imparted by treading, each piece of the garment was in contact with another part of it. Through that connection, each piece was rendered ritually impure with the impurity of having been in contact with ritual impurity imparted by treading. When the garment was subsequently split, although the pieces were no longer able to impart ritual impurity imparted by treading, they retained the ritual impurity they acquired through their contact with the other pieces before the garment was split. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> In this case, the contact between the pieces occurred within a concealed area, as the connection between parts of the same item has the status of a connection within a concealed area. Evidently, Rabbi Meir holds that impurity can be imparted within a concealed area.
<b>And it is taught</b> in that mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei says,</b> disagreeing with Rabbi Meir: <b>But what</b> source of impurity <b>imparted by treading did these</b> pieces <b>touch?</b> Rabbi Yosei disregards the contact between the pieces that occurred before the garment was split, as that contact has the status of a connection within a concealed area. <b>Rather,</b> the only way the pieces could still be ritually impure is if <b>a <i>zav</i> had touched</b> the garment directly, e.g., when he sat on the garment he also touched it with his skin. In that case the garment would have also been rendered <b>ritually impure due to contact with a <i>zav</i>,</b> and that impurity would remain even after the garment was split. It would appear, then, that the opinion of Rabbi Meir in the mishna here can be reconciled only with the opinion of Rabbi Meir in the mishna in <i>Kelim</i>, but not with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei.
The Gemara responds: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna in <i>Kelim</i> that <b>Ulla said: They taught</b> that Rabbi Yosei disagrees with Rabbi Meir <b>only</b> in the case of a garment of <b>three by three</b> handbreadths <b>that was split</b> into smaller pieces, as once it is split, there is no piece large enough to impart to the other pieces impurity imparted through treading.
<b>But</b> with regard to pieces of <b>three by three</b> fingerbreadths <b>that come,</b> i.e., are cut, <b>from a large garment,</b> everyone agrees that <b>at the time of their separation from their original</b> garment, before they are fully detached from it, <b>they are rendered impure through</b> their contact with the <b>original</b> garment, despite the fact that the contact occurs within a concealed area. In <b>this</b> case of the mishna here <b>also,</b> one can say that <b>at the time of separation</b> of the flesh of the fetus <b>from</b> the <b>limb,</b> i.e., the foreleg, it is <b>rendered impure through</b> its contact with <b>the limb.</b> According to Ulla, then, the mishna can be reconciled also with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei.
<b>Ravina said</b> there is a different explanation of how the mishna can be reconciled with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei: <b>A garment does not stand,</b> i.e., is not intended, <b>to be cut.</b> On the contrary, it is better for it to remain whole. Therefore, the connections between its pieces are regarded as being within a concealed area that cannot impart impurity. By contrast, with regard to <b>a fetus</b> that extends its foreleg, the foreleg <b>does stand to be cut,</b> as it is prohibited for consumption while the rest of the fetus is permitted, <b>and</b> the halakhic principle is that <b>any</b> item <b>that stands to be cut</b>

Daf 73a

<b>is regarded as though it were cut.</b> Therefore, it is regarded as though the foreleg had already been severed from the body of the fetus, and the point of contact between them is not considered to be a concealed area. Rather, it is regarded as if the foreleg and fetus were two separate items that came into contact with each other. Consequently, the former can impart impurity to the latter.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with</b> whose opinion is this halakhic principle that Ravina cites? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Mikvaot</i> 10:5): When a vessel is immersed in a ritual bath, it is purified only if all parts of the vessel are submerged at the same time. But with regard to <b>any handles of vessels that are</b> too <b>long and</b> therefore <b>will ultimately be cut off, one</b> must <b>immerse them</b> only <b>until the point of</b> their eventual <b>size.</b> Even though the part of the handle that will be cut off is not submerged, the vessel is nevertheless purified; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Meir holds that even though the handle is still physically attached, since that part of the handle stands to be cut off, it is already regarded as though it were cut off. Consequently, immersing the handle up until that point is regarded as immersing the entire vessel.
<b>And the Rabbis say</b> that the vessel is not purified <b>until he immerses all of it,</b> including the handle. Apparently, the Rabbis do not hold that an item that stands to be cut is regarded as though it was already cut, and Ravina’s explanation is in accordance only with the opinion of Rabbi Meir.
The Gemara responds: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that Ravina’s explanation is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The disagreement between the Rabbis and Rabbi Meir concerns utensils, but even the Rabbis agree that the <b>connections</b> between two pieces <b>of food are</b> disregarded, and the item is <b>considered as though it is</b> already <b>separated</b> into two pieces <b>that are touching one another,</b> and so ritual impurity can be imparted from one piece to another. Similarly, the fetus and the foreleg are considered like food in this regard. Therefore, it is considered as if they have already been separated and are touching, allowing the foreleg to impart impurity to the fetus.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the explanation of <b>Ulla</b> that the fetus was rendered impure at the time of separation of the flesh of the fetus from the limb, <b>this</b> explanation is consistent with <b>that which</b> the mishna <b>teaches,</b> that the foreleg <b>was severed</b> from the body of the fetus. <b>But according to</b> the explanation of <b>Ravina,</b> the connection between the foreleg and fetus is like that of food, and even if the foreleg was never severed from the fetus it would still impart impurity to the fetus. <b>What,</b> then, is the reason the mishna states <b>it was severed?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the mishna needed to <b>teach</b> in <b>the first clause</b> that the foreleg <b>was severed, it also taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> that <b>it was severed,</b> for stylistic consistency, even though the <i>halakha</i> would apply even were it not severed.
§ The mishna states: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The flesh of a fetus that extended its foreleg outside the mother’s womb and whose mother was subsequently slaughtered has ritual impurity due to having been in <b>contact with a <i>tereifa</i> that was slaughtered.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Does a slaughtered <i>tereifa</i> impart impurity?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> and this is <b>in accordance</b> with the statement <b>of Shmuel’s father, as Shmuel’s father says:</b> The Sages decreed that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> that one slaughtered imparts impurity to sacrificial</b> animals, i.e., it will disqualify them if it comes in contact with them.
§ The mishna cites the Rabbis’ rationale for their opinion: <b>Just as we found in</b> the case of <b>a <i>tereifa</i> that its slaughter renders it ritually pure</b> according to Torah law, i.e., it prevents it from having the ritual impurity of a carcass, despite not rendering the animal permitted for consumption, <b>so too, the slaughter of</b> the mother <b>animal should render the</b> limb of its <b>fetus</b> that left the womb <b>ritually pure,</b> despite the fact that it is prohibited for consumption.
The mishna itself proceeds to cite Rabbi’s Meir’s response to this claim. The Gemara here cites a different version of his response based on that which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>But what renders this limb pure from</b> the impurity of <b>a carcass?</b> You might say it is <b>the slaughter of its mother,</b> but <b>if so,</b> the act of slaughter <b>should</b> also <b>permit</b> it even <b>for consumption.</b>
The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> The slaughter of an animal has <b>a greater effect in shielding that which is not</b> part of <b>its body</b> from having the ritual impurity of a carcass <b>than that which is</b> part of <b>its body, as</b> is apparent from that <b>which we learned</b> in the mishna (68a): If, prior to slaughtering an animal, one <b>severs</b> pieces <b>from a fetus that is in</b> its <b>womb,</b> leaving those pieces in the womb, their <b>consumption is permitted</b> by virtue of the slaughter of the mother animal. By contrast, if one severs pieces <b>of the spleen or of the kidneys</b> of an animal and then slaughtered it, then even if those pieces were left inside the animal, their <b>consumption is prohibited.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the response of the Rabbis: <b>What are</b> the Rabbis <b>saying? Rava said, and some say it unattributed [<i>kedi</i>]</b> to any particular Sage, that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete, and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: Rabbi Meir said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>But what renders this limb pure from</b> the impurity of <b>a carcass?</b> You might say it is <b>the slaughter of its mother,</b> but <b>if so, it should</b> also <b>permit it</b> even <b>for consumption.</b> In response the Rabbis <b>said to him: Let</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a <i>tereifa</i> prove</b> the point, <b>as its slaughter renders it pure from</b> the impurity of <b>a carcass but it does not permit it for consumption.</b> Similarly, the slaughter of the mother animal should render pure even the foreleg of its fetus, even if it does not permit it for consumption.
Rabbi Meir <b>said to them: No,</b> even <b>if the slaughter of a <i>tereifa</i> renders</b> the animal itself <b>pure</b> from having the impurity of a carcass, that is true with regard to <b>something that is</b> part <b>of its own body.</b> Does it necessarily follow that <b>it should</b> also <b>render pure the limb</b> of its fetus, which is <b>something that is not</b> part of <b>its own body?</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> The slaughter of an animal <b>has a greater effect in shielding that which is not</b> part of <b>its body</b> from having the impurity of a carcass <b>than that which is</b> part of <b>its body, as</b> is apparent from that <b>which we learned</b> in the mishna at the beginning of the chapter: If one <b>severs</b> pieces <b>from a fetus that is in</b> an animal’s <b>womb</b> and then slaughters the mother animal, their <b>consumption is permitted.</b> By contrast, if one severs pieces <b>of the spleen or of the kidneys</b> of an animal and then slaughters it, their <b>consumption is prohibited.</b>
The Gemara notes that <b>this</b> clarification of Rava <b>is also taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>But what renders this limb pure from</b> the impurity of <b>a carcass?</b> The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>the slaughter of its mother.</b> Rabbi Meir responded: But <b>if so, it should</b> also <b>permit it</b> even <b>for consumption.</b> In response the Rabbis <b>said to him: Let</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a <i>tereifa</i> prove</b> the point, <b>as its slaughter renders it pure from</b> the impurity of <b>a carcass but it does not permit it for consumption.</b> Similarly, the slaughter of the mother animal should render pure even the foreleg of its fetus, even if it does not permit it for consumption.
Rabbi Meir <b>said to them:</b> Even <b>if the slaughter of a <i>tereifa</i> renders</b> the animal itself <b>pure, and</b> likewise the slaughter of any animal renders <b>the limb that</b> was partially cut from it but still <b>hangs from it</b> pure from imparting the impurity of a carcass despite being prohibited for consumption, that is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>something that is</b> part of <b>its own body.</b> Does it necessarily follow that <b>it should</b> also <b>render pure the limb</b> of its fetus, which is <b>something that is not</b> part of <b>its own body?</b>
The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> The slaughter of an animal <b>has a greater effect in shielding that which is not</b> part of <b>its body</b> from imparting the ritual impurity of a carcass <b>than that which is</b> part of <b>its body, as</b> is apparent from that <b>which we have learned</b> in the mishna above: If one <b>severed</b> pieces <b>from a fetus that was in</b> an animal’s <b>womb</b> and then slaughtered the mother animal, their <b>consumption is permitted.</b> But if one severed pieces <b>of the spleen or of the kidneys</b> of an animal and then slaughtered it, their <b>consumption is prohibited.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Just as</b> there is <b>a dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>with regard to fetuses,</b> concerning whether the slaughter of the mother prevents a limb that emerged from the womb from having the impurity of a carcass, <b>so</b> too, they have a parallel <b>dispute with regard to limbs</b> of an animal that were partially cut from it but still hanging from it, whether the slaughter of the animal prevents such limbs from having the impurity of a carcass.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Their <b>dispute</b> is only <b>with regard to a limb of a fetus</b> that emerged from the womb, <b>but with regard to a limb</b> hanging <b>from an animal, everyone agrees</b> that the <b>slaughter</b> of the animal <b>renders</b> such a limb as though it had already <b>fallen</b> off prior to the slaughter, and the slaughter does not prevent the limb from having the impurity of a carcass.
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is the reason</b> for the distinction made <b>by Rabbi Yoḥanan concerning</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> that the slaughter of an animal renders pure the limb of its fetus, but does not render pure a limb hanging from the animal itself? The reason is that <b>this</b> limb of the fetus that emerged from its womb <b>has</b> a means of <b>rectification by returning back</b> inside the womb, in accordance with the opinion that it will then be permitted for consumption by virtue of the slaughter of the mother animal. <b>But this</b> hanging limb <b>does not have</b> a means of <b>rectification by returning,</b> as it cannot be reattached to the animal’s body.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion from the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>Rabbi Meir said to them: No,</b> even <b>if the slaughter of a <i>tereifa</i> renders pure</b> the animal itself <b>and</b> similarly the slaughter of any animal renders pure <b>the limb that is hanging from it</b> from having the impurity of a carcass, this is true with regard to <b>something that is</b> part of <b>its own body.</b> Does it necessarily follow that <b>it should</b> also <b>render pure the limb</b> of its fetus, which is <b>something that is not</b> part of <b>its own body?</b>

Daf 73b

Rabbi Meir’s statement appears inconsistent with his opinion, as he holds that a hanging limb is not rendered pure by slaughtering the animal. The Gemara suggests that this difficulty can be resolved only according to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish’s version of the Rabbis’ opinion, but not according to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s version. <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> one can explain that Rabbi Meir <b>was speaking in accordance with the statement of</b> the Rabbis, as follows: <b>According to my</b> own opinion, there <b>is no difference</b> with regard to <b>the limb of a fetus, and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> with regard to <b>a limb</b> hanging <b>from an animal; they are the same</b> in that the slaughter of the animal does not render either of them pure. Accordingly, Rabbi Meir must have been speaking in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis that a limb hanging from an animal is rendered pure by the animal’s slaughter.
<b>But according to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who holds that both the Rabbis and Rabbi Meir agree that a limb hanging from an animal is not rendered pure by the animal’s slaughter, Rabbi Meir’s statement is <b>difficult,</b> as it is inconsistent with both his opinion and the Rabbis’ opinion. The Gemara concedes the challenge.
<b>Rather, if</b> such a dispute <b>was stated, it was stated like this: Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Just as</b> there is <b>a dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>with regard to fetuses</b> whose limbs emerged from the womb, <b>so</b> too, they have a parallel <b>dispute with regard to limbs</b> hanging from an animal. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Their <b>dispute is</b> only <b>with regard to the limb of a fetus</b> that emerged from the womb; <b>but with regard to a limb</b> hanging <b>from an animal, everyone agrees</b> that the <b>slaughter</b> of the animal <b>does not render</b> such a limb as though it had already <b>fallen off</b> prior to the slaughter, and does not impart the impurity of a carcass. According to this version of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s understanding of the dispute, Rabbi Meir’s statement is consistent even with his own opinion.
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What is the reason</b> for the distinction made <b>by Rabbi Yoḥanan concerning</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir,</b> that the slaughter of an animal does not render pure the limb of its fetus, but it does render pure a limb hanging from the animal itself? It is that <b>this</b> hanging limb is part of the animal’s <b>body, but that,</b> the limb of the fetus, is <b>not</b> part of <b>its body.</b>
§ The Gemara continues to elucidate the dispute between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Everyone agrees that</b> the <b>death</b> of an animal by means other than slaughter <b>renders</b> a limb as though it had already <b>fallen off</b> prior to the animal’s death. Therefore, it will not have the impurity of a carcass, but it will have the impurity of a limb taken from a living animal. <b>And</b> likewise, everyone agrees that the <b>slaughter</b> of the animal <b>does not render</b> a limb as though it had already <b>fallen off</b> prior to the slaughter, and therefore it will not have the impurity of a carcass.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are we dealing with</b> here? <b>If we say</b> we are dealing <b>with a limb of</b> its <b>fetus</b> that emerged from its womb, Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis explicitly <b>disagree</b> with regard to this case. <b>Rather,</b> we are dealing <b>with a limb</b> hanging <b>from an animal.</b> But if so, Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is unnecessary. With regard to a hanging limb, <b>we</b> already <b>learn</b> about the effect of the <b>death</b> of the animal in a mishna elsewhere, and <b>we</b> already <b>learn</b> about the effect of the <b>slaughter</b> of the animal in a mishna elsewhere.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>We</b> already <b>learn</b> about the effect of the <b>death</b> of an animal in the mishna (127b): If <b>the animal died</b> without slaughter, any hanging <b>flesh needs</b> to be rendered <b>susceptible</b> to contracting ritual impurity in order to become impure. This is accomplished by coming in contact with liquid, with the owner’s approval. The reason is that its halakhic status is that of flesh severed from a living animal, which is ritually pure and does not have the status of an unslaughtered carcass. <b>And</b> a hanging <b>limb imparts impurity as a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> animal, <b>but does not impart impurity as a limb from a carcass;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Meir holds that upon the animal’s death, anything hanging from the animal is considered as though it had already fallen off before the animal’s death. Since the mishna does not record that the Rabbis disagree, it would appear that they agree.
Likewise, <b>we</b> already <b>learn</b> about the effect of the <b>slaughter</b> of an animal in the same mishna: If <b>the animal is slaughtered, they,</b> the limb and the flesh hanging from it, <b>are</b> thereby <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity, by coming in contact <b>with its blood.</b> Blood is one of the seven liquids that render foods susceptible to impurity and its presence is considered to be with the approval of the owner, as it makes the meat look redder and fresher; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says: They were not rendered susceptible</b> to impurity through the animal’s own blood, but only once they were wet with another liquid, with the owner’s approval. It is apparent that both opinions in that mishna agree that the limb does not have the impurity of a limb severed from a living animal. Evidently, they hold that the slaughter does not render the hanging limb as though it had already fallen off beforehand.
Given that the mishna has already taught both <i>halakhot</i>, what was the necessity of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement? The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> these <i>halakhot</i> were derived only <b>from that</b> mishna, <b>I would say</b> that actually, slaughter does render a hanging limb as though it had already fallen off beforehand, and such a limb would have the impurity of a limb severed from a live animal. If so, <b>what</b> does the mishna mean when it states: <b>They are rendered susceptible</b> to impurity by coming in contact with its blood? Ostensibly, the intention is that both the limb and the flesh must be rendered susceptible to impurity, which indicates that the limb does not have any impurity of its own. The Gemara explains: One would have explained that the need to be rendered susceptible to impurity is referring only <b>to the flesh,</b> as flesh severed from a living animal does not have any impurity of its own.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches: They are rendered susceptible,</b> in the plural, which is apparently referring to both the flesh and the limb, which were mentioned previously in the mishna. The Gemara explains: <b>You might say</b> that the plural is used because the statement is referring to two types of hanging flesh that upon slaughter are considered to have been separated from a living animal: <b>One</b> is <b>for flesh that separates from</b> the body of <b>the animal, and</b> the other <b>one</b> is <b>for flesh that separates from the</b> hanging <b>limb.</b> Neither type has its own impurity, so they must be rendered susceptible to impurity by coming in contact with liquid.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> it <b>more compelling</b> to apply the <i>halakha</i> <b>to this</b> type of flesh <b>than</b> to <b>that</b> type, making it necessary to state the <i>halakha</i> with regard to both? The Gemara answers: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> flesh that is attached to a limb severed from a living animal <b>imparts</b> the same <b>severe</b> form of <b>ritual impurity</b> as the limb <b>on account of being a part of</b> it, one might <b>say</b> that once the flesh is separated from the limb it does <b>not need to</b> then <b>be rendered susceptible</b> to impurity. To reject this possibility, the mishna uses the plural form to <b>teach us</b> that this type of flesh does need to be rendered susceptible to impurity.
§ <b>Rav Yosef said: Take</b> the statement <b>that Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef</b> says that Rabbi Yoḥanan says, i.e., that the slaughter of an animal does not render a hanging limb as though it had already fallen off prior to the slaughter, <b>in your hand,</b> i.e., accept it as correct, <b>as Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> also <b>holds in accordance with</b> this opinion. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And flesh that is torn in the field, you shall not eat”</b> (Exodus 22:30). This serves <b>to include</b> the case of <b>the limb or the flesh that was</b> partially cut off but was still <b>hanging on a domesticated animal or on an undomesticated animal or on a bird, and one slaughtered</b> them; it is derived <b>that they are prohibited</b> as limbs severed from a living animal. <b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> with regard to the ruling of this <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 74a

In fact, such limbs and flesh are not prohibited by Torah law, as the slaughter does not render them as though they had already fallen off prior to the slaughter, and the verse cited in the <i>baraita</i> is not a true derivation but a mere support. Accordingly, <b>with regard to them, there is nothing other than</b> a rabbinic <b>mitzva to separate</b> oneself from consuming them.
§ <b>Rav Yosef sat before Rav Huna, and he sat and said: Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>one ate this</b> hanging limb he is <b>flogged</b> for violating the prohibition against eating a limb from a living animal. <b>One of the Sages said to him: Do not listen to his</b> statement in the name of Rav, as <b>this</b> is what <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta says in the name of Rav:</b> If <b>one ate this</b> hanging limb <b>he is not flogged.</b>
<b>Rav Huna said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Upon whose</b> version of Rav’s ruling <b>shall we rely? Rav Yosef turned his face away</b> in anger <b>and said to him: What is the difficulty? When I said</b> in Rav’s name that one is flogged for eating a limb that had been hanging from an animal when it died, I was <b>referring to</b> a case of <b>death</b> by means other than slaughter, <b>which renders</b> the limb as though it had already <b>fallen</b> off prior to the animal’s death. <b>When</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta <b>said</b> in the name of Rav that one is not flogged, he was <b>referring to</b> the case of <b>a slaughter, which does not render</b> the limb as though it had already <b>fallen off</b> prior to the slaughter and therefore serves to render the limb permitted for consumption.
§ <b>Rava said: From where is this matter that the Sages stated</b> derived: The <b>death</b> of an animal by means other than slaughter <b>renders</b> a hanging limb as though it had already <b>fallen off</b> prior to the slaughter, whereas the <b>slaughter</b> of the animal <b>does not render</b> a limb as though it had already <b>fallen off? As it is written</b> with regard to the eight species of impure creeping animals: <b>“And anything that these fall upon, when they are dead, it shall be impure”</b> (Leviticus 11:32). <b>What</b> does the term “when they are dead” serve <b>to exclude? If we say</b> it serves <b>to exclude</b> the time <b>when they are alive,</b> that principle is <b>derived from:</b> “And everything upon which any part <b>of their carcass</b> falls shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:35), which explicitly states that only their carcasses impart impurity. <b>Rather, learn from</b> the verse that <b>death renders</b> a hanging limb as though it had already <b>fallen off,</b> and <b>slaughter does not render</b> a hanging limb as though it had already <b>fallen off.</b>
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said to Rava: But</b> this <b>verse is written with regard to creeping animals,</b> which do not require slaughter. How then can a <i>halakha</i> with regard to slaughter be derived from here? Rava <b>said to him: If,</b> because it is superfluous, this verse <b>is not</b> referring to the <b>matter of creeping animals, which are not subject to the</b> requirement of <b>slaughter, apply it</b> to the <b>matter of an animal,</b> which is subject to slaughter.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the phrase “when they are dead, it shall be impure” <b>is still necessary</b> to teach a different <i>halakha</i>, i.e., that they impart impurity only when they are still in a state <b>similar to</b> their state at the time of their <b>death,</b> i.e., if they <b>are moist they impart impurity,</b> whereas if they <b>are dry they do not impart impurity.</b> The Gemara explains that <b>“when they are dead” is written twice,</b> once in the verse cited, and once in the previous verse, which states: “Whoever touches them when they are dead shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:31).
§ The Gemara returns to the dispute in the mishna (72a) with regard to a fetus that extended its foreleg and then its mother was slaughtered. Rabbi Meir holds that the foreleg is regarded as a carcass with the associated impurity, while the Rabbis hold that although it is not permitted for consumption, the slaughter prevents it from having the impurity of a carcass. With regard to this dispute, <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The <b>dispute concerns</b> only <b>the limb of a fetus that was alive</b> when the mother was slaughtered; <b>but concerning</b> the case of <b>the limb of a fetus that was dead</b> when the mother was slaughtered, <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>slaughter renders</b> the fetus’s limb as though it had already <b>fallen off</b>  prior to the slaughter, and it imparts impurity as a limb from a living animal. <b>But Rabba said:</b> Just <b>as</b> there is <b>a dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>concerning this</b> case, where the fetus was alive, <b>so</b> too, there is <b>a dispute</b> between them <b>concerning that</b> case, where the fetus had died.
§ The mishna states that <b>an eight-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus that was born <b>alive</b> is not rendered ritually pure by slaughtering it. The reason given is that the concept of permitting an animal through slaughter is never stated with regard to that kind of animal. The Gemara challenges: But <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in a discussion about whether slaughter renders a <i>tereifa</i> pure from the impurity of a carcass: <b>An eight-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus that was born <b>alive will prove</b> the point, <b>as even though there are</b> other animals <b>of that kind</b> that are permitted through <b>slaughter, its slaughter does not render it pure</b> from having the impurity of a carcass. This refutes the claim that the issue of slaughter rendering an animal pure from having the impurity of a carcass is a function of whether or not the concept of slaughter applies to that kind of animal.
<b>Rav Kahana said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> holds that even with regard to an eight-month-old fetus it can be said that <b>there are</b> animals <b>of that kind</b> that are permitted through <b>slaughter,</b> i.e., when they are still inside the womb and the mother is slaughtered; such an animal is permitted <b>by virtue of</b> the slaughter of <b>its mother.</b> Therefore, he cites the case of an eight-month-old fetus as a refutation. <b>But the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna holds that the fact that this <b>kind</b> of animal is permitted by virtue of the slaughter <b>of its mother</b> does not define it as a kind of animal concerning which there is a concept of slaughter, and therefore he holds that this case <b>cannot be used as a refutation.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to that <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>who does use</b> it <b>as a refutation, from where does he</b> derive <b>that the slaughter of a <i>tereifa</i> renders it pure</b> from having the impurity of a carcass? The Gemara answers that he <b>derives it from that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Rav says, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if some domesticated animal,</b> of which you may eat, <b>dies,</b> one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The word “some” teaches that only <b>some</b> dead <b>animals impart impurity</b> as a carcass, <b>but some</b> dead <b>animals do not impart impurity</b> as a carcass. <b>And what is</b> it <b>that</b> does not impart impurity? <b>That is a <i>tereifa</i> that one slaughtered.</b>
§ <b>Rav Hoshaya raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>inserted his hand inside the womb of an animal and slaughtered a nine-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus that was <b>alive, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the slaughter performed inside the mother render the fetus permitted? The Gemara notes: This dilemma <b>may be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> and it <b>may be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: It <b>may be raised according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> It is possible that <b>Rabbi Meir states</b> in the mishna below that a nine-month-old <b><i>ben pekua</i> requires slaughter,</b> and slaughter renders the animal permitted <b>only</b> in that case, because <b>that statement</b> may apply only in a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>emerged into the airspace of the world,</b> i.e., once it was born alive. <b>But</b> if it is still <b>inside its mother,</b> its <b>slaughter does not render it permitted.</b>
<b>Or perhaps even the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Meir and maintain that a nine-month-old <i>ben pekua</i> is permitted by virtue of its mother’s slaughter, would concede that the slaughter of the fetus itself also permits it. Perhaps <b>with regard to</b> such an animal <b>the Merciful One considers four <i>simanim</i>,</b> i.e., the windpipe and the gullet of the mother and the windpipe and the gullet of the fetus, <b>to be fit</b> for slaughter, and the fetus is permitted by the cutting of either pair.
<b>Rav Ḥananya said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of this dilemma from the mishna (72b), as it considers an animal <b>that was born as a <i>tereifa</i> from the womb</b> as one that never had a period of potential fitness. <b>But if it is so,</b> that one can slaughter a fetus in its mother’s womb, <b>you find that</b> actually <b>it did have a period of</b> potential <b>fitness, as if one wants</b> to, <b>he can insert his hand</b> into the womb <b>and slaughter it</b> before it develops into a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Ḥananya: <b>Teach</b> that mishna as referring to a case <b>where</b> the fetus <b>was formed as a <i>tereifa</i></b> from its outset <b>while inside the womb, and you find such</b> a case <b>where</b> a fetus <b>has five legs,</b> which certainly developed from the outset. Consequently, there was never a possibility of slaughtering it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughtered an animal and found within it an eight-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus, i.e., one that was not full term, whether it was <b>alive or dead, or a nine-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus, i.e., one that was full term, that was <b>dead,</b> that fetus is permitted by virtue of the slaughter of its mother, as it is considered part of its mother. Therefore, its blood is considered part of its mother’s blood and is prohibited, so one must <b>tear</b> the fetus <b>and remove its blood</b> before it may be consumed.
If <b>he found</b> within it <b>a live nine-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus, <b>it requires</b> its own <b>slaughter,</b> as it is considered an independent full-fledged animal, <b>and</b> if one slaughters both the mother and fetus on the same day, <b>one is liable for</b> violating the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring</b> on the same day; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> Even when the fetus is nine months old, it is still considered part of its mother, and <b>the slaughter of its mother renders it permitted</b> for consumption.

Daf 74b

<b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: Even</b> if the fetus emerged alive and <b>is</b> now <b>five years old and plowing in the field,</b> the earlier <b>slaughter of its mother rendered it permitted</b> and it does not require slaughter before it is eaten. But if <b>one tore</b> an animal, i.e., he killed it without slaughtering it, <b>and</b> inside <b>he found a live nine-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus, everyone agrees that the fetus <b>requires</b> its own <b>slaughter because its mother was not slaughtered.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> The Sages <b>discussed</b> the permissibility of a live nine-month-old fetus found inside a slaughtered animal <b>only with regard to the matter of</b> whether it requires its own <b>slaughter.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What does</b> Rav Oshaya’s statement serve <b>to exclude?</b> Rav Oshaya’s statement indicates that with regard to other matters all agree that it is considered an independent animal, with the associated prohibitions. The Gemara suggests: It serves <b>to exclude its fat,</b> i.e., the fats that are prohibited in a regular animal, such as the fat of the kidneys and innards, <b>and its</b> sciatic <b>nerve.</b>
The Gemara asks: The <b>fat of which</b> part? <b>If we say</b> that this is referring to the <b>fat of</b> the <b>fetus,</b> that is difficult because the Sages <b>disagree</b> as to whether or not it is permitted, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The prohibition of <b>the sciatic nerve applies to a fetus and its fat is prohibited;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The prohibition of the sciatic nerve <b>does not apply to a fetus, and its fat is permitted. And Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> This <b>dispute concerns a live nine-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus, <b>and Rabbi Meir follows his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning,</b> which he expressed in the mishna, that such a fetus is considered an independent full-fledged animal; <b>and Rabbi Yehuda</b> follows <b>his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning,</b> as expressed by the Rabbis in the mishna, that such a fetus is considered a part of the mother.
<b>Rather,</b> say that Rabbi Elazar is referring to the <b>fat of</b> the sciatic <b>nerve</b> of the fetus, which all agree is permitted. The Gemara rejects this as well: But the Sages also <b>disagree</b> with regard to that, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the sciatic nerve, one scrapes around it</b> to remove it entirely <b>in any place that it is</b> found in the thigh, <b>and one cuts out its fat completely,</b> even those fats that are sunk into the flesh; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: One cuts out</b> the nerve and the fat that is <b>level with the flesh</b> of the thigh, but there is no obligation to remove all traces of the fat.
<b>Rather, if</b> Rabbi Oshaya’s statement <b>was stated, it was stated like this: Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> The Sages <b>discussed</b> the permissibility of the fetus <b>only with regard to matters of consumption,</b> i.e., whether or not it must be slaughtered in order to permit its flesh and whether or not the fat and the sciatic nerve are permitted. This statement serves <b>to exclude</b> only one who <b>copulates with</b> the animal, <b>or</b> one who <b>plows with it</b> together with an animal of a different species, as everyone agrees that these prohibitions apply to such a fetus just as they do to any other animal.
§ A related amoraic dispute is cited concerning a live nine-month-old fetus found inside a slaughtered animal: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: According to the statement of</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>who permits the fat,</b> he also <b>permits its blood; according to the statement of</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>who prohibits its fat,</b> he also <b>prohibits its blood. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even according to</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>who permits its fat,</b> he <b>prohibits its blood.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> from the mishna, which states with regard to an eight-month-old fetus, whether alive or dead, or a dead nine-month-old fetus, found inside a slaughtered animal, that since it is considered part of the mother its blood is prohibited. Therefore, one must <b>tear</b> the fetus <b>and remove its blood</b> before it may be consumed. The mishna prohibits the blood but apparently permits the rest of the fetus, including its fat, which contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish. In resolution of this difficulty, <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish meant <b>to say</b> only <b>that</b> the consumption of blood lost as the fetus died <b>is not punishable by excision from the World-to-Come</b> [<b><i>karet</i>],</b> whereas Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that it is.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>According to whom did</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>state</b> that one who permits the fat of the fetus also holds that the consumption of its blood is not punishable by <i>karet</i>? Ostensibly, it is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who permits its fat. But that is difficult, because this blood <b>should be regarded only as blood of exudate,</b> i.e., blood that exudes from the neck of the animal after the initial spurt of its slaughter concludes. This blood did not spurt out during the slaughter of the mother. Rabbi Yehuda holds that consumption of even this blood is punishable by <i>karet</i>, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The consumption of <b>blood of exudate</b> is prohibited <b>by</b> a regular <b>prohibition</b> and is punishable with lashes, unlike the initial spurt of blood, known as blood of the soul, whose consumption is punishable by <i>karet</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Blood of exudate is also punishable <b>by <i>karet</i>.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef, son of Rav Salla the Pious, interpreted</b> this matter <b>before Rav Pappa:</b> One of the verses prohibiting the consumption of blood states: “And whoever…eats any blood, and I will set My face against that soul that eats the blood, and will cut him off from among his people” (Leviticus 17:10). <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that since it would have been sufficient for the verse to state: <b>Blood, but</b> instead it states: <b>“Any blood,”</b> it is interpreted as teaching that <b>wherever one is liable</b> for <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> the consumption of <b>blood of the soul,</b> i.e., the initial spurt from the slaughter, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a regular animal, one <b>is</b> also <b>liable</b> for <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> the consumption of <b>blood of exudate,</b> i.e., the rest of the blood. <b>But wherever</b> one <b>is not liable</b> for <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> the consumption of <b>blood of the soul,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the blood of a fetus according to Rabbi Yehuda, who holds that the fetus is not considered an independent life, one <b>is</b> also <b>not liable</b> for <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> the consumption of <b>blood of exudate;</b> rather, its blood is subject to a regular prohibition.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to redeeming</b> a firstborn donkey <b>with a <i>ben pekua</i>?</b> Can one perform the mitzva, as stated in the Torah: “And every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb” (Exodus 13:13), with this animal? The Gemara elaborates: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir do not raise the dilemma, as, since he says</b> a <i>ben pekua</i> <b>requires slaughter,</b> evidently <b>it is a full-fledged lamb,</b> and therefore it can certainly be used to redeem a donkey.
<b>When should you raise the dilemma?</b> Raise it <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis, as they say</b> that <b>the slaughter of its mother renders it permitted. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case? Does one say that <b>since</b> the Rabbis <b>say</b> that <b>the slaughter of its mother renders it permitted, it is</b> apparent that despite being physically alive, a <i>ben pekua</i> is halakhically regarded <b>like meat</b> placed <b>in a pot,</b> which cannot be used to redeem a donkey (see <i>Bekhorot</i> 12a)? <b>Or perhaps, since</b> the animal is <b>running back and forth,</b> i.e., it is alive, <b>we call it a lamb</b> and it can be used?
<b>Mar Zutra said: One cannot redeem</b> a donkey with this lamb, <b>and Rav Ashi said: One can redeem</b> it.
<b>Rav Ashi said to Mar Zutra: What</b> is the reason for <b>your opinion?</b> Is it <b>because you derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of redeeming a firstborn donkey <b>from Paschal offerings</b> by means of a verbal analogy between the term <b>“lamb”</b> (Exodus 13:13) written concerning a firstborn donkey and <b>“lamb”</b> (Exodus 12:5) written concerning a Paschal offering, and a <i>ben pekua</i> is unfit for sacrifice as a Paschal offering?
<b>If</b> so, <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the Paschal offering, it must be <b>male, unblemished, and in its</b> first <b>year, so too here,</b> the lamb must be <b>male, unblemished, and in its</b> first <b>year.</b> Yet the mishna in <i>Bekhorot</i> (9a) states explicitly that one may redeem with a female lamb, and even if it is blemished, and also with one that is past its first year. Mar Zutra responded: The repetition of the words <b>“You shall redeem,” “You shall</b> not <b>redeem”</b> written in the verse: “And every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb, and if you shall not redeem it then you shall break its neck” (Exodus 13:13), <b>included</b> a lamb that does not fulfill these criteria.
Rav Ashi responds: <b>If</b> the repetition of <b>“You shall redeem,” “You shall</b> not <b>redeem”</b> serves <b>to amplify,</b> then it should <b>even</b> amplify <b>all</b> other types of lambs, including a <i>ben pekua</i>, i.e., they should also be included in the category of those that are fit for redemption. Mar Zutra answers: <b>If</b> that was <b>so, what purpose would</b> the verbal analogy of <b>“lamb,” “lamb” serve?</b> Rather, the repetition of “You shall redeem” serves to include all types of lambs, but the verbal analogy still serves to exclude a <i>ben pekua</i>.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: According to the Rabbis, a <i>ben pekua</i> is permitted for consumption and is therefore susceptible to ritual impurity. If the <i>ben pekua</i> was still inside the slaughtered mother and the body of the mother came in contact with a primary source of ritual impurity, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to counting</b> the mother as having <b>first-</b>degree ritual impurity <b>and</b> the <i>ben pekua</i> as having <b>second-</b>degree ritual impurity? If the fetus is considered independent of the mother, it is rendered impure only through its contact with the mother and so would have second-degree impurity. But if it is considered part of the mother it would have the same first-degree impurity as the mother.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One counts</b> the mother as having <b>first-</b>degree impurity <b>and</b> the <i>ben pekua</i> as having <b>second</b>-degree impurity. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: One does not count</b> the mother as having <b>first-</b>degree impurity <b>and</b> the <i>ben pekua</i> as having <b>second</b>-degree impurity. Rather, the fetus has first-degree impurity like its mother, as <b>it is considered like a nut rattling in its shell;</b> this is considered a single entity such that if impurity touches the shell, both the nut and the shell are rendered impure with the same degree of impurity.
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish raised an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> from the mishna (72a): If a fetus extended its foreleg outside its mother’s womb and then the mother was slaughtered, and afterward the foreleg was severed, <b>the flesh</b> of both the mother and the fetus are ritually impure due to having been in <b>contact with a carcass.</b> Since the foreleg was not permitted through an act of slaughter it is regarded as a carcass with the associated ritual impurity. The rest of the flesh, which was permitted, was in contact with it and was thereby rendered ritually impure; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The flesh has the ritual impurity of having been in <b>contact with a <i>tereifa</i> that was slaughtered.</b> The limb is regarded as a <i>tereifa</i> that was slaughtered, which by Torah law is prohibited for consumption but does not carry ritual impurity. Nevertheless, the Sages decreed that if a <i>tereifa</i> was slaughtered and then came in contact with another item, the other item should be regarded as ritually impure to the extent that it will disqualify sacrificial foods that come in contact with it.
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish explains his objection: <b>Granted, according to my</b> opinion, <b>as I say</b> that the mother and fetus together <b>are one entity; that is</b> why the flesh of the fetus <b>is rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity <b>through the blood of its mother</b> that spilled onto the body of the mother. When the blood from the mother’s slaughter renders the mother susceptible to impurity, the fetus is also rendered susceptible to impurity, as it is considered part of the mother. <b>But according to your</b> opinion, that the fetus is an independent entity, <b>through what</b> means is <b>it rendered susceptible</b> to contracting impurity from its foreleg?
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: It is rendered susceptible <b>through the slaughter</b> of its mother, which also permits the consumption of the fetus, <b>and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that the flesh of a slaughtered animal is rendered susceptible to ritual impurity by virtue of the fact that it is permitted for consumption, even if it did not come in contact with blood or one of the other six liquids. Accordingly, the fetus will be susceptible to impurity even if it is not considered part of its mother.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If a <i>ben pekua</i> grew up and <b>passed through a river, it was</b> thereby <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity. Therefore, if it <b>went</b> from there <b>to a cemetery, it is rendered impure.</b>
Rabbi Yoḥanan explains his objection: <b>Granted, according to my</b> opinion, <b>as I say</b> that the mother and fetus <b>are two entities;</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason that only if the <i>ben pekua</i> itself <b>has been rendered susceptible</b> to impurity by coming in contact with the water of the river, <b>yes,</b> it can be rendered impure upon entering a cemetery, whereas if <b>it has not been rendered susceptible</b> to impurity through these waters, <b>no,</b> it does not become impure when it enters a cemetery. <b>But according to your</b> opinion, in <b>which you said</b> that the mother and fetus together <b>are one entity,</b> why is it necessary for it to have passed through a river? <b>It was</b> already <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity <b>through the blood of its mother</b> that spilled onto the mother’s body when it was slaughtered.

Daf 75a

Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish answers: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of the mother was <b>dry,</b> i.e., where no blood was emitted, and therefore, even the mother was not rendered susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that the flesh of a slaughtered animal is rendered susceptible to ritual impurity by virtue of the fact that it is permitted for consumption, regardless of whether or not it came into contact with blood or other liquids.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this <i>baraita</i>: If a <i>ben pekua</i> grew up and <b>passed through a river, it was</b> thereby <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity, and therefore if it <b>went</b> from there <b>to a cemetery, it is rendered impure? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili:</b> The flesh of a <i>ben pekua</i> <b>can become impure with the ritual impurity of food, but it</b> first <b>needs to be rendered susceptible</b> to ritual impurity by coming in contact with liquid. <b>But the Rabbis say: It cannot become impure with the ritual impurity of food because it is alive, and any live</b> animal <b>cannot become impure with the ritual impurity of food,</b> even if it is permitted for consumption.
The Gemara notes: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan follows his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Beit Shammai said the same thing,</b> i.e., they both hold that even a live animal can become impure with the ritual impurity of food.
The opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> is <b>that which we stated</b> in the <i>baraita</i>. The opinion of <b>Beit Shammai</b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:8): With regard to <b>fish, from when are they susceptible to impurity</b> as food? <b>Beit Shammai say: From when they are caught</b> in a trap, as at this point they are considered food, since they do not require slaughter. <b>And Beit Hillel say: From when they die. Rabbi Akiva says: From when they are no</b> longer <b>able to live.</b>
The Gemara analyzes that mishna: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rabbi Akiva and Beit Hillel? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The difference <b>between them</b> is the case of <b>a convulsing fish.</b> Rabbi Akiva holds that such a fish can already become ritually impure, while Beit Hillel require it to have actually died.
<b>Rav Ḥisda raises a dilemma:</b> According to Rabbi Akiva, if <b>symptoms of a <i>tereifa</i> developed in a fish,</b> e.g., a perforation in the intestines, which will certainly result in the animal’s death (see 42a), <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Can it already be rendered ritually impure as if it were now dead? The Gemara clarifies: One can <b>raise this dilemma according to the one who says</b> that an animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> can <b>live,</b> i.e., it will not necessarily die within a year, <b>and</b> one can <b>raise this dilemma according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> cannot live,</b> but will die within a year.
The Gemara elaborates: One can <b>raise this dilemma according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> can <b>live,</b> as perhaps that opinion is limited to <b>an animal, as</b> an animal has <b>a strong life force,</b> and it could live despite such symptoms. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a fish, whose life force is not strong,</b> all would agree that it will <b>not</b> survive. <b>Or perhaps, even according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> cannot live,</b> it is possible that <b>this matter,</b> that a <i>tereifa</i> is regarded as dead, applies only to <b>an animal, as</b> the requirement to <b>slaughter</b> it in order to permit it for consumption <b>applies to this type</b> of creature, i.e., to animals, and so to invalidate its slaughter, the Torah classifies an animal that is a <i>tereifa</i> as though it is dead. But with regard to <b>fish, where</b> the requirement to <b>slaughter</b> it in order to permit it <b>does not apply to this type</b> of creature, <b>I would say</b> that a fish with symptoms of a <i>tereifa</i> is <b>not</b> considered as though it were dead. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The Rabbis state in the mishna that a nine-month-old fetus is considered to be part of its mother. Therefore, when the mother is slaughtered, the entire fetus is permitted, including all its fats. The Gemara asks: If an animal <b>expelled a non-viable newborn,</b> what is the status of the fetus’s fat? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Its fat is like the fat</b> of any other <b>domesticated animal,</b> and one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> if he eats it. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Its fat is like the fat of an undomesticated animal,</b> which is not prohibited.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Its fat is like the fat of</b> any other <b>domesticated animal,</b> as he maintains that the exit of a fetus through <b>the airspace</b> of the opening of the womb <b>causes</b> it to be regarded as an independent animal. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Its fat is like the fat of an undomesticated animal,</b> as he maintains that the completion of the <b>months</b> of gestation <b>causes</b> a fetus to be regarded as an independent animal, and this stillborn did not reach this stage.
<b>Some say</b> that there is another explanation of this dispute: In <b>any case where its months</b> of gestation <b>were not completed,</b> everyone agrees that <b>it is nothing,</b> i.e., it is not an independent animal and its fat is not included in the prohibition of forbidden fats. <b>When they disagree</b> it is with regard to a case <b>where</b> one <b>inserted his hand into the womb of an animal and removed the fat of a live nine-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus <b>and ate</b> it. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Its fat is like the fat of</b> any other <b>domesticated animal,</b> as the <b>months</b> of gestation alone <b>cause</b> it to be regarded as an independent animal. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Its fat is like the fat of an undomesticated animal,</b> as it is the <b>months</b> of gestation <b>and</b> its exit through the <b>airspace</b> of the opening of the womb that together <b>cause</b> it to be regarded as an independent animal. Since this fetus was not yet born, it is not subject to the prohibition of forbidden fats.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the sacrifice of the fat surrounding a fetus inside a pregnant animal: <b>Just</b> as with regard to the requirement to sacrifice <b>the fat and two kidneys</b> (see Leviticus 7:3–4), <b>which is stated with regard to a guilt offering,</b> the fat of <b>a fetus is excluded from the category</b> of fats that one is required to sacrifice because a guilt offering is always a male, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>every</b> offering, even in the case of a female offering, the fat of <b>a fetus is excluded from the category</b> of fats that one is required to sacrifice.
Rabbi Yoḥanan explains his objection: <b>Granted, according to my</b> opinion that the fat of a fetus is forbidden for consumption, <b>this is why a verse was necessary to exclude</b> it from being sacrificed on the altar. <b>But according to your</b> opinion that it is not forbidden, <b>why is</b> a verse <b>necessary</b> to exclude it? Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>said to him: My explanation is also</b> derived <b>from</b> the verse <b>here,</b> which serves as the source for the fact that the fat of a fetus is not forbidden.
<b>And some say</b> that there is another version of this objection in which <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish raised</b> an <b>objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> from that <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just</b> as with regard to the requirement to sacrifice <b>“the fat and two kidneys” that is stated with regard to a guilt offering,</b> the fat of <b>a fetus is excluded from the category</b> of fats that one is required to sacrifice, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>every</b> offering, the fat of <b>a fetus is excluded from the category</b> of fats that one is required to sacrifice.
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish explains the objection: <b>Granted, according to my</b> opinion that the fat of the fetus is not prohibited like the other fats, it is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>the Merciful One excludes it</b> from the requirement of being sacrificed. <b>But according to your</b> opinion, that the fat of the fetus is considered one of the forbidden fats, <b>let it</b> also <b>be sacrificed.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> The reason that this fat is not sacrificed is <b>just as it is</b> with regard to an offering <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, i.e., it is not yet seven days old, which may not be sacrificed (see Leviticus 22:27) despite being of a species of animal that may be sacrificed. Similarly, with regard to the fat of the fetus, despite being included among those fats that are prohibited, it may not be sacrificed.
§ The Gemara returns to the dispute in the mishna with regard to a nine-month-old fetus found alive inside its slaughtered mother. Rabbi Meir holds that the fetus itself must be slaughtered in order to permit it, whereas the Rabbis hold that it is permitted by virtue of the slaughter of its mother. <b>Rabbi Ami said:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughtered a <i>tereifa</i> and found inside it a live nine-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus: <b>According to the statement of</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>who prohibits</b> a nine-month-old fetus found inside a kosher animal until it is slaughtered itself, if it is found inside a <i>tereifa</i> <b>he permits</b> the fetus once it is slaughtered itself. But <b>according to the statement</b> of Rabbi Yehuda, referred to as the Rabbis in the mishna, <b>who permits</b> a nine-month-old fetus found inside a kosher animal by virtue of the slaughter of its mother, if it is found inside a <i>tereifa</i> <b>he prohibits</b> it, even if it is slaughtered itself.
<b>Rava said: According to the statement of</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>who permits</b> a nine-month-old fetus found inside a kosher animal by virtue of the slaughter of its mother, he <b>also permits</b> it if it is found inside a <i>tereifa</i>, once the fetus itself is slaughtered. The reason is that <b>the Merciful One considers four <i>simanim</i> to be fit</b> for slaughter, i.e., the windpipe and gullet of the mother and those of the fetus, with the fetus being permitted by the cutting of either pair.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> With regard to <b>one who slaughtered a <i>tereifa</i> and found inside it a live nine-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus,

Daf 75b

the fetus <b>requires</b> its own <b>slaughter</b> to permit its consumption, <b>and it is subject to the obligation to</b> give <b>the foreleg and the jaw and the maw</b> to a priest, as is required for a non-sacred animal that is slaughtered. <b>But</b> nevertheless, <b>if it dies,</b> the fact that its mother was slaughtered serves to render it <b>pure with regard to imparting impurity</b> to people <b>through</b> their <b>carrying</b> of it, as it does not impart the impurity of a carcass.
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: Your ruling is inconsistent. When you say it <b>requires slaughter, in accordance with whose</b> opinion is that? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> that a live nine-month-old fetus is not permitted by virtue of its mother’s slaughter. <b>But</b> when you say that <b>if it dies,</b> it is <b>pure with regard to imparting impurity through carrying, in accordance with whose</b> opinion is that? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
Rav Ḥisda replied: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> the same difficulty arises with <b>that which Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who slaughtered</b> an animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i> and found inside it a live nine-</b>month<b>-old</b> fetus, it <b>requires</b> its own <b>slaughter, and it is subject to the obligation to</b> give <b>the foreleg and the jaw and the maw</b> to a priest. <b>But</b> nevertheless, <b>if it dies,</b> it is <b>pure with regard to imparting impurity through carrying.</b> When he says that it <b>requires slaughter, in accordance with whose</b> opinion is that? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. But</b> when he says that <b>if it dies,</b> it is <b>pure with regard to imparting impurity through carrying,</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
Rava responded: <b>That</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as it is possible that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya was speaking</b> about <b>if one found</b> that the fetus <b>had already died</b> inside the mother. In such a case, Rabbi Meir concedes that its mother’s slaughter renders it pure, as stated in the mishna. Accordingly, the <i>baraita</i> is entirely in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir. <b>But according to your</b> opinion, that even if it was found alive and died later it is pure from the impurity of a carcass, it is <b>difficult.</b>
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>According to my</b> opinion <b>also</b> it is <b>not difficult,</b> as I claim that the entire <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, and although the slaughter of its mother permits the fetus, its own slaughter can also permit it, as <b>the Merciful One considers four <i>simanim</i> to be fit</b> for slaughter, two of the mother and two of the fetus, the fetus being permitted through the cutting of either pair.
The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Zeira ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>Rav Asi found him sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i></b> of Rav Ḥisda, i.e., that the Merciful One considers four <i>simanim</i> to be fit for slaughter. Rav Asi <b>said to him: That is correct, and so says Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> Rabbi Zeira asked him: Can I conclude <b>by inference</b> from your statement <b>that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s colleague, <b>disagrees with him?</b>
Rav Asi answered: I do not know, as after Rabbi Yoḥanan made his statement, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>was waiting for him</b> to see if he would retract, <b>and</b> he therefore <b>remained silent</b> about whether or not he disagreed. But it is possible that after I left, he disagreed. <b>And some say</b> that Rav Asi said: At that time, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>was drinking, and</b> that is why he <b>remained silent.</b> Therefore, I do not know whether or not he disagreed.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: Even</b> if a nine-month-old fetus emerged alive and is now five years old and plowing in the field it does not require slaughter. The Gemara asks: This opinion of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri <b>is</b> identical to that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., the Rabbis. What difference is there between them? <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> The difference <b>between them</b> is a case where the fetus <b>stood upon the ground.</b> According to the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>, once the fetus walks on the ground there is a rabbinic decree requiring that it be slaughtered before it is consumed, lest people mistakenly permit other animals without slaughter. Rabbi Shimon Shezuri disagrees and holds that it does not require slaughter.
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya said: According to the statement of the one who says</b> that when defining the status of an animal <b>one</b> needs <b>to be concerned with its paternity,</b> if <b>a <i>ben pekua</i> copulated with a full-fledged animal, the offspring has no rectification.</b> Although when the mother and father are each a <i>ben pekua</i> the offspring is permitted without ritual slaughter, if the father is a <i>ben pekua</i> but the mother is not, the offspring is simultaneously defined as requiring slaughter, based on the mother, and being excluded from the requirement for slaughter, based on the father. Therefore, no act of slaughter can permit it.
<b>Abaye says: Everyone,</b> i.e., even the first <i>tanna</i>, who requires the slaughter of a <i>ben pekua</i> that stood upon the ground, <b>agrees with regard to a <i>ben pekua</i></b> with <b>non-cloven</b> hooves that was found inside a kosher animal, <b>that it is permitted</b> by virtue of the slaughter of its mother. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is that <b>people remember any bizarre matter,</b> and there is no concern that if it is permitted without slaughter, people will mistakenly permit regular animals without slaughter. <b>Some say</b> that <b>Abaye said: Everyone agrees with regard to a <i>ben pekua</i></b> with <b>non-cloven</b> hooves found inside an animal with <b>non-cloven</b> hooves that was itself born to a kosher animal, <b>that</b> the fetus <b>is permitted</b> without slaughter even if it stood on the ground. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is that <b>people remember two bizarre matters.</b>
<b>Ze’eiri says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Shezuri</b> that a <i>ben pekua</i> is permitted without slaughter even if it stood upon the ground. <b>And similarly, Rabbi Shimon Shezuri would permit</b> without slaughter <b>the offspring</b> of a <i>ben pekua</i> <b>and the offspring of its offspring,</b> and so on <b>to the end of all</b> future <b>generations. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: It,</b> the <i>ben pekua</i> itself, <b>is permitted, but its offspring is prohibited</b> unless it is slaughtered.
The Gemara relates: <b>Adda bar Ḥavu had a <i>ben pekua</i> that was attacked by a bear</b> and was about to die. <b>He came before Rav Ashi</b> to inquire what to do. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Go</b> and <b>slaughter it</b> before it dies so that you can eat it, in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> that if a <i>ben pekua</i> stood upon the ground it requires slaughter. Adda bar Ḥavu <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: <b>But doesn’t Ze’eiri say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri</b> that a <i>ben pekua</i> is permitted without slaughter even if it stood upon the ground, <b>and similarly, Rabbi Shimon Shezuri would permit</b> without slaughter <b>the offspring</b> of a <i>ben pekua</i> <b>and the offspring of its offspring,</b> and so on <b>to the end of all</b> future <b>generations? And even Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who disagreed, <b>said</b> his dissenting opinion <b>only</b> with regard to <b>its offspring, but</b> with regard to a <i>ben pekua</i> <b>itself,</b> he did <b>not</b> disagree that it is permitted.
Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Adda bar Ḥavu: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan was speaking according to the statement of Rabbi Shimon Shezuri,</b> i.e., he said that even Rabbi Shimon Shezuri permits only a <i>ben pekua</i> itself, but not its offspring. But Rabbi Yoḥanan himself agrees with the first <i>tanna</i> that a <i>ben pekua</i> that stood upon the ground is prohibited without slaughter.
Adda bar Ḥavu persisted: <b>But didn’t Ravin bar Ḥanina say</b> that <b>Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> with regard to a different issue: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri; and moreover,</b> not only is the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with his opinion with regard to this matter, but in <b>any place where Rabbi Shimon Shezuri taught</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>in our Mishna,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion?
Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Adda bar Ḥavu: <b>I hold in accordance with this</b> statement of Rabbi Yonatan, <b>as Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri in</b> the case of one who is <b>dangerously ill, and in</b> the case of <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe of doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>],</b> but not in other cases, e.g., in the case of his disagreement with the first <i>tanna</i> concerning a <i>ben pekua</i>.
The Gemara now elaborates on these two cases. The case of one who is <b>dangerously ill</b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 65b): <b>Initially,</b> the Sages <b>would say</b> that in the case of <b>one who is taken out in a neck chain [<i>bekolar</i>]</b> to be executed <b>and</b> who <b>said: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, these</b> people who hear <b>should write</b> the document <b>and give</b> it to her. Although there was no explicit instruction to give it to her, this is understood to have been his intention, in order to release her from the obligation to perform levirate marriage or the ritual through which she becomes free of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>]. <b>They then said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even</b> to <b>one who sets sail and one who departs in a caravan</b> to a distant place. A bill of divorce is given to his wife under these circumstances even if her husband said only: Write a bill of divorce for my wife. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Shezuri says: Even</b> in the case of <b>one who is dangerously ill</b> who gives that instruction, they write the bill of divorce and give it to his wife.
The case of <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe of <i>demai</i></b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 4:1): With regard to <b><i>teruma</i> of the tithe of <i>demai</i>,</b> i.e., <i>teruma</i> of the tithe that was separated from the produce of an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, who is suspected of not separating tithes properly, <b>that</b> fell and <b>returned to its</b> original <b>place,</b> becoming mingled with the rest of produce from which it had been separated, <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Shezuri says: Even on a weekday one may ask</b> the <i>am ha’aretz</i> whether or not he separated the necessary tithes <b>and</b> then <b>eat based on his statement.</b>

Daf 76a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an animal whose hind legs were severed,</b> if they were severed <b>from the leg joint and below,</b> the animal is <b>kosher; from the leg joint and above,</b> the animal is thereby rendered a <i>tereifa</i> and is <b>not kosher. And likewise,</b> an animal <b>whose convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh <b>was removed</b> is a <i>tereifa</i> and is not kosher.
If <b>the bone</b> of a limb <b>was broken</b> but the limb was not completely severed, and the animal was then slaughtered, <b>if the majority of the flesh</b> surrounding the bone <b>is intact, the slaughter of</b> the animal <b>renders it permitted; but if not, its slaughter does not render it permitted.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya says:</b> When the mishna makes reference to the leg being severed from the leg joint and <b>below,</b> it means that the cut was <b>below the leg joint,</b> and when it says that if it was severed from the leg joint and <b>above</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>it means</b> that the cut was <b>above the leg joint.</b> And <b>with regard to which leg joint did they say</b> this? <b>With regard to</b> the <b>leg joint that is sold together with the head</b> of the animal. This is the lower leg joint that connects the lower bone, or metatarsus, and middle bone, or tibia. Accordingly, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> only if the leg was severed in the middle bone or upper bone.
<b>Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya</b> says: The mishna is referring to the leg joint that in most animals cannot be seen from the outside, but <b>the corresponding</b> joint <b>in</b> the leg of <b>a camel</b> is prominent and <b>conspicuous.</b> This is referring to the joint between the upper bone, or femur, and middle bone, or tibia. Accordingly, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i> only if it was severed in the upper bone.
<b>Ulla said to Rav Yehuda: Granted, according to my</b> opinion, <b>as I say</b> it means the joint whose <b>corresponding</b> joint <b>in</b> the leg of a camel is <b>conspicuous,</b> i.e., the upper joint, <b>this</b> explanation is consistent with <b>that which</b> the mishna <b>teaches: And likewise,</b> an animal <b>whose convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh <b>was removed</b> is not kosher. The convergence of sinews lies on the lower part of the middle bone. Since I hold that if the middle bone is severed, this does not render the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, it is necessary for the mishna to teach that nevertheless, if that bone was severed at the point of the convergence of sinews, this would render it a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>But according to your</b> opinion that the mishna is referring to the lower joint, and if the middle bone is severed, this renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>what</b> is the purpose of teaching: <b>And likewise,</b> an animal <b>whose convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh <b>was removed</b> is not kosher?
Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Ulla: According to my opinion, the mishna is referring to two cases: The first is where the leg was severed above the lower <b>leg joint,</b> in the middle bone, <b>without</b> the removal of <b>the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh, <b>and</b> the second is where <b>the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh was removed <b>without</b> the leg above the <b>leg joint</b> being severed. Ulla then asked Rav Yehuda: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches: Were severed,</b> indicating that the leg was entirely severed, which perforce includes the convergence of sinews. Rav Yehuda <b>was silent,</b> as he did not have a resolution.
<b>After</b> Ulla <b>left,</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said</b> to himself: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>I did not say to him</b> the following resolution: When the mishna states that if the leg was severed <b>below</b> the leg joint the animal is kosher, it means <b>below the</b> lower <b>leg joint,</b> and when it says that if it was severed <b>above</b> it is a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>it means</b> in the middle bone above <b>the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh. Accordingly, it would still be necessary to teach that if the convergence of sinews in the thigh was removed, this would render it a <i>tereifa</i>.
Rav Yehuda <b>then said</b> to himself: It is good that I did not suggest this resolution, as <b>did I not</b> initially <b>say</b> a resolution <b>to him, and he said to me</b> that it was refuted by the fact that the mishna <b>teaches: Were severed,</b> which clearly indicates that it was severed completely? <b>Here too,</b> he could have said: You cannot explain the mishna as referring only to severing the leg above the convergence of sinews, as the mishna <b>teaches: From the</b> lower <b>leg joint and above,</b> which clearly includes the entire middle bone, including the area of the convergence of sinews.
<b>Rav Pappa teaches</b> the previous discussion <b>like this: Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya says:</b> When the mishna refers to severing the leg <b>below,</b> it means severing <b>below</b> both <b>the leg joint and the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh, i.e., the lower bone was severed, and when it refers to severing the leg <b>above,</b> it means severing <b>above</b> both <b>the leg joint and the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh, i.e., the upper bone was severed. <b>And</b> then the mishna adds that with regard to the middle bone, it is only a <i>tereifa</i> <b>when</b> the <b>convergence of sinews was removed.</b> And this explanation assumes that <b>the leg joint itself</b> is referring to the upper leg joint, <b>in accordance with</b> that which <b>Ulla said</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya</b> said, i.e., that it means the joint whose corresponding joint in the leg of a camel is conspicuous.
The Gemara questions Rav Pappa’s explanation of the opinions of Ulla and Rav Yehuda: <b>But is there any</b> possibility <b>that if one went higher up</b> the leg and <b>severed</b> the middle bone above the convergence of sinews, <b>it would live,</b> i.e., the animal would not be a <i>tereifa</i>, but if <b>one went down</b> the leg and <b>severed it</b> on the convergence of sinews, it would be a <i>tereifa</i> <b>and would die</b> within twelve months? It is illogical that severing more of the leg is less life-threatening for the animal.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Are you comparing</b> different types of <b><i>tereifot</i> to one another? One cannot say with regard to <i>tereifot</i></b> that <b>this is similar to that, as</b> different areas of an animal’s body react differently: One <b>cuts it from here,</b> at a low point on the animal’s body, <b>and it</b> could <b>die;</b> and one <b>cuts it from there,</b> at a higher point, <b>and it</b> could <b>live.</b>
§ The Gemara asks: <b>And which</b> parts are included in <b>the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh, such that if they are removed it renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>? The sinews at the bottom of the bone cleave to it, as there is no flesh on that part of the bone. A short distance above that they separate from the bone and then they diverge from each other as they enter the flesh. <b>Rabba says</b> that <b>Rav Ashi</b> says: Those <b>which are off the bone,</b> before they diverge. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav Ashi</b> says: Those <b>which are adjacent to the bone. Rava, son of Rabba bar Rav Huna, says</b> that <b>Rav Asi</b> says: The convergence of sinews begins even lower and includes those <b>which are above the <i>arkum</i></b> bone, a small bone that lies between the lower bone and the middle bone of the leg.
The Gemara relates: <b>One of the Sages sat before Rabbi Abba, and he sat and said:</b> The convergence of sinews includes the sinews <b>of the <i>arkum</i></b> bone <b>itself. Rabbi Abba said to</b> his students: <b>Do not listen to</b> that Sage, as his ruling is too stringent. <b>This</b> is what <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> It is in the place <b>where butchers split open</b> the animal’s leg. The Gemara comments: <b>And this is</b> the same as that which <b>Rava, son of Rabba bar Rav Huna,</b> says that <b>Rav Asi says,</b> i.e., that it includes the sinews above the <i>arkum</i>.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: The convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh <b>that they spoke</b> of in the mishna is the <b>place where the sinews converge</b> and appear as though they are a single entity. The Gemara asks: <b>And until how far</b> does it extend? <b>One of the Sages, and his name is Rav Ya’akov, said to them: When we were</b> studying <b>in the school of Rav Yehuda, he said to us: Hear from me a matter that I heard from a great man, and who is he? Shmuel. The convergence of sinews that they spoke</b> of is the <b>place where the sinews converge, and</b> it extends <b>from</b> the <b>place where they converge until</b> the <b>place where they diverge</b> and are subsumed within the flesh.
The Gemara asks: <b>And how far</b> is this? <b>Abaye said: Four handbreadths in an ox.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the measure <b>in a small domesticated animal? Abaye said:</b> There is no set measure; rather, as long as the sinews are <b>prominent</b> and are not subsumed within the flesh, <b>they are</b> part of <b>the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh, but once they are <b>subsumed they are not</b> considered part of <b>the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh.
Abaye adds: The sinews that are <b>hard are</b> part of <b>the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh; those that are <b>soft are not</b> part of <b>the convergence of sinews.</b> Those that are <b>thick are</b> part of <b>the convergence of sinews;</b> those that are <b>thin are not</b> part of <b>the convergence of sinews.</b> Those that are <b>white are</b> part of <b>the convergence of sinews;</b> those that are <b>not white are not</b> part of <b>the convergence of sinews.</b>

Daf 76b

<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said: Once</b> the sinews begin to be <b>translucent, even if they are not</b> actually <b>white,</b> they are considered part of the convergence of sinews.
§ With regard to the removal of the convergence of sinews in the thigh, which renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>Ameimar says in the name of Rav Zevid: There are three strands,</b> i.e., sinews; <b>one</b> is <b>thick and</b> the other <b>two</b> are <b>thin.</b> If the <b>thick</b> sinew <b>was severed, a majority of the structure</b> of the convergence of sinews <b>is gone,</b> as the thick sinew is thicker than the other two combined. If <b>the thin ones were severed,</b> then <b>a majority of the number</b> of sinews <b>is gone.</b> If either type of majority has been severed, the animal is rendered a <i>tereifa</i>. Conversely, <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi teaches a lenient</b> version of this ruling: If the <b>thick</b> sinew <b>was severed,</b> since <b>there is a majority</b> of the <b>number</b> of sinews that remains, the animal is not a <i>tereifa</i>. Likewise, if <b>the thin ones were severed,</b> since <b>there is a majority of the structure</b> that remains intact, the animal is not a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara comments: All this applies to animals, whereas <b>with regard to birds, there are sixteen strands; if</b> even <b>one of them is severed,</b> it is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. Mar bar Rav Ashi said: I was standing before father,</b> i.e., Rav Ashi, <b>and they brought before him a bird, and he examined</b> it to see if it was a <i>tereifa</i> <b>and found fifteen</b> sinews. <b>There was one</b> of them <b>that was different from the others; he broke it apart and it was found</b> to be composed of <b>two</b> sinews.
The Gemara returns to the issue of the convergence of sinews in an animal. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: The convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh of <b>which</b> the Sages <b>spoke,</b> stating that if it is severed the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, is referring <b>to</b> the severing of <b>the majority of it.</b> Rav Yehuda added: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>the majority of it?</b> This means <b>the majority of one of</b> the sinews. Rav Yehuda further stated: <b>When I stated this</b> <i>halakha</i> in the name of Rav <b>before Shmuel, he said to me: Since they are three</b> sinews, <b>when one of them is severed entirely, there are</b> still <b>two</b> remaining, which means that the majority of the convergence of sinews is intact. Therefore, the animal is still kosher.
The Gemara infers from Shmuel’s statement: The <b>reason</b> the animal is not a <i>tereifa</i> is only that <b>there are two</b> remaining, from which it may be inferred that if <b>there are not two</b> remaining it is <b>not</b> kosher, despite the fact that the other sinew is intact. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> according to this version of his opinion, Shmuel <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbenai,</b> who also stated his ruling in Shmuel’s name. <b>As Rabbenai says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh, <b>even if only</b> one sinew <b>remains of it,</b> which is as thick <b>as</b> the <b>string</b> used to close the neckline of <b>a cloak [<i>hasarbal</i>],</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b>
<b>And some say</b> that there is a different version of this discussion. Rav Yehuda said: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>a majority of it?</b> This means <b>a majority of each and every one of</b> the sinews. Rav Yehuda added: <b>When I stated this</b> <i>halakha</i> in the name of Rav <b>before Shmuel, he said to me: Since they are three</b> sinews, <b>there is one-third of each and every one,</b> and that should be sufficient. There is no need for a majority of each sinew to remain. The Gemara notes: Rav Yehuda’s statement in the name of Shmuel <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbenai, as Rabbenai says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>the convergence of sinews</b> in the thigh of <b>which</b> the Sages <b>spoke, even if</b> there <b>remains of</b> each of the three sinews <b>only</b> as much <b>as</b> the thickness of the <b>string</b> used to close the neckline of <b>a cloak,</b> the animal is <b>kosher.</b> This also indicates that there is no need for a majority of the sinew to remain.
§ The mishna states: If <b>the bone</b> of a limb <b>was broken</b> but the limb was not completely severed, and the animal was then slaughtered, if the majority of the flesh surrounding the bone is intact, the slaughter of the animal renders it permitted; but if not, its slaughter does not render it permitted.
<b>Rav says:</b> If the bone was broken <b>above the leg joint</b> and then the animal was slaughtered, <b>if a majority of the flesh</b> around the break <b>is intact,</b> both <b>this,</b> the animal itself, <b>and that,</b> the limb, are <b>permitted.</b> The break does not render the animal a <i>tereifa</i> and the limb is not regarded as a hanging limb; therefore it is permitted by the slaughter of the animal. <b>But if not,</b> i.e., if a majority of the flesh around the break is not intact, both <b>this and that,</b> the animal and the limb, are <b>prohibited.</b> If the bone was broken <b>below the leg joint,</b> then <b>if a majority of the flesh is intact,</b> both <b>this and that</b> are <b>permitted; if not,</b> then the <b>limb</b> itself is <b>prohibited</b> from the area of the break and below, as it is not permitted by the slaughter of the animal, <b>but</b> the rest of the <b>animal is permitted.</b>
<b>And Shmuel says: Whether</b> the break is <b>above or below</b> the leg joint, the <i>halakha</i> is the same: <b>If a majority of the flesh is intact,</b> both <b>this and that,</b> the limb and the animal, are <b>permitted. If</b> the majority of the flesh is <b>not</b> intact, the <b>limb</b> is <b>prohibited and</b> the <b>animal is permitted.</b> Even if the leg was broken above the leg joint the animal does not become a <i>tereifa</i> unless the leg was entirely severed.
<b>Rav Naḥman objects to this</b> ruling <b>of Shmuel:</b> If one permits the animal despite the fact that its leg is prohibited, people <b>will say: A limb from</b> the animal <b>is placed in the garbage,</b> as it is prohibited, <b>and</b> yet the animal itself <b>is permitted?</b> They may then mistakenly conclude that even if that leg had been completely severed from the animal, the animal would be permitted. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Huna said to Rav Naḥman:</b> This concern <b>also</b> exists <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> in a case where the bone is broken below the joint and the flesh is not intact. Rav rules in that case that the animal is permitted and the limb is prohibited. But is there not the concern that people <b>will say: A limb from</b> this animal <b>is placed in the garbage, and</b> the animal itself <b>is permitted?</b>
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: This is</b> what I meant to <b>say:</b> People will say: <b>A limb from which</b> this animal <b>lives,</b> i.e., which if removed, renders the animal a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>is placed in the garbage, and</b> the animal itself <b>is permitted?</b> The concern exists only according to the opinion of Shmuel, who permits the animal even when the break is above the joint, as were it severed there, the animal would thereby be rendered a <i>tereifa</i>. People may mistakenly equate the case where the bone was broken and the case where it was severed and permit both. The concern does not exist according to the opinion of Rav, as he permits the animal only in a case where the bone is broken below the joint, and even if it were severed there that would not render it a <i>tereifa</i>.
§ With regard to this dispute, <b>they sent</b> a ruling <b>from there,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav</b> that if the bone was broken above the leg joint, if a majority of the flesh around the break is not intact, both the animal and the limb are prohibited. <b>They then sent</b> a ruling: The <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel</b> that only the limb is prohibited. <b>They then</b> a ruling: The <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav</b> that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>and</b> they added that the <b>limb itself</b> is not rendered pure by the slaughter; rather, it <b>imparts</b> the <b>impurity</b> of a limb from a living animal <b>by carrying.</b> The animal itself, though, is rendered pure from the impurity of a carcass and is prohibited only as a <i>tereifa</i>.
<b>Rav Ḥisda raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> cited earlier (73a) concerning whether the slaughter of a mother animal can render pure a limb of its fetus that was extended outside the womb even though the act of slaughter cannot render the fetus permitted for consumption. The Rabbis brought proof for their opinion that this limb is rendered pure from the <i>halakha</i> that a <i>tereifa</i> is rendered pure by slaughter even though it is not thereby permitted for consumption. Rabbi Meir responded: <b>No,</b> even <b>if the slaughter of a <i>tereifa</i> renders</b> the animal itself <b>pure, and</b> likewise, the slaughter of any animal renders pure <b>the limb that</b> was partially cut from it but still <b>hangs from it</b> from imparting the impurity of a carcass, despite the fact that this animal or limb is prohibited for consumption, that is so with regard to <b>something that is</b> part <b>of its own body.</b> Does it necessarily follow that <b>it should</b> also <b>render pure the limb</b> of its fetus, which is <b>something that is not</b> part <b>of its own body?</b> It is explicit in Rabbi Meir’s claim that the hanging limb of a <i>tereifa</i> is rendered pure by the slaughter of the animal.
<b>Rabba said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>Why are you searching after refutations</b> from <i>baraitot</i> that are not known by all? You can <b>raise a conclusive refutation from the mishna</b> (127b): With regard to the limb or flesh of an animal that was partially severed but remains hanging from it, if <b>the animal was slaughtered,</b> the limb and the flesh <b>were</b> thereby <b>rendered susceptible</b> to contracting the impurity of food <b>by the blood</b> of the animal, as blood is one of the seven liquids that render foods susceptible to impurity; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says: They were not rendered susceptible</b> with the blood of the slaughtered animal. It is evident that according to all opinions in the mishna, the hanging limb and flesh are not regarded as a limb or flesh from a living animal, which would not need to be rendered susceptible to impurity, as they impart their own impurity.
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rabba: The difficulty from <b>the mishna can be refuted, as we refuted</b> it earlier (73a), by claiming that the dispute about the blood rendering the animal susceptible to impurity concerns only the hanging flesh, but that a hanging limb from an animal that was slaughtered does have the status of a limb from a living animal and the associated impurity.
The Gemara relates that <b>when Rabbi Zeira ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>he found Rav Yirmeya sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i></b> of Rav, i.e., that if the bone is broken above the leg joint and the flesh is not intact, the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him:</b> You have spoken <b>well, and Aryokh interpreted</b> the matter <b>likewise in Babylonia.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who is Aryokh?</b> It is <b>Shmuel. But</b> that is difficult, as Shmuel <b>disagrees</b> with Rav concerning this issue. The Gemara explains: <b>Shmuel retracted his</b> opinion <b>in favor of</b> that of <b>Rav.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>the bone broke and protruded outward, if skin and flesh cover a majority of</b> the bone the animal is <b>permitted; if not,</b> it is <b>prohibited.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is <b>a majority of</b> a bone? <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A majority of its width, and some say</b> that he said: <b>A majority of its circumference. Rav Pappa said: Therefore,</b> as there is no clear ruling on the matter, <b>we require</b> that the bone be covered by <b>a majority of its width, and we</b> also <b>require</b> that it be covered by <b>a majority of its circumference.</b>
<b>Ulla said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Skin is like flesh</b> with regard to this issue, i.e., if the flesh has been removed but the skin covers a majority of the bone, the animal is kosher. <b>Rav Naḥman said to Ulla: And let the Master say</b> that <b>skin combines with flesh,</b> i.e., that if flesh and skin together cover a majority of the bone the animal is kosher, <b>as</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the above <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: Skin and flesh,</b> which indicates that skin alone is ineffective. Ulla <b>said to him: We learned</b> that the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>Skin or flesh.</b>
<b>Some say</b> that there is a different version of this discussion: <b>Ulla said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Skin combines with flesh. Rav Naḥman said to Ulla: And let the Master say</b> that <b>skin completes</b> the amount of <b>flesh</b> required, and this <b>is a stringent</b> ruling. This would mean that if the majority of the bone is covered mostly with flesh and the rest of the majority is covered with skin the animal is kosher, but if the majority is covered half with flesh and half with skin, it is not kosher.
Ulla <b>said to him: I know</b> my ruling from the following <b>incident: As there was a certain fledgling that was in the house of Rabbi Yitzḥak,</b> and its leg broke, and <b>it was</b> a situation where the <b>skin combined with flesh</b> to cover the majority of the bone. <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak came before Rabbi Yoḥanan and he deemed</b> the bird <b>kosher.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Do you speak</b> of <b>a fledgling?</b> The <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a fledgling is different, as</b> its skin <b>is soft</b> and is considered like flesh.
The Gemara further relates: There was a case involving <b>certain soft sinews</b> that combined with flesh to cover the majority of a broken bone, and <b>they came before Rabba</b> for a ruling. <b>Rabba said: What concern</b> is there <b>with</b> the sinews in <b>this</b> case? <b>First,</b> there is no concern, <b>because Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>sinews that will ultimately harden,</b>

Daf 77a

<b>one may be registered</b> as part of a group that will eat the <b>Paschal offering on their account,</b> i.e., even if those sinews are the only part of the lamb he will eat. Evidently, such sinews are regarded as flesh. <b>And furthermore, the Torah spared the money of the Jewish people,</b> and one must tend toward leniency.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rabba:</b> But <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> disagrees with Rabbi Yoḥanan and holds that one may not be registered for those sinews, as they will eventually harden and are therefore not considered flesh. <b>And</b> therefore, the broken bone in this case is not covered by flesh and the animal is <b>prohibited by Torah law</b> as a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>and</b> yet <b>you say: What concern</b> is there <b>with</b> the sinews in <b>this</b> case? Rabba <b>was silent.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And why was</b> Rabba <b>silent? But doesn’t Rava say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> in his disputes with Rabbi Yoḥanan only <b>with regard to these three</b> matters, i.e., three matters that are mentioned in <i>Yevamot</i> 36a, and not in other cases? If so, Rabba could simply have replied that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish with regard to this issue.
The Gemara answers: <b>Here,</b> with regard to sinews that will ultimately harden, <b>it is different, as Rabbi Yoḥanan retracted his</b> ruling <b>in favor of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, as</b> when Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish raised a difficulty against Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Do not provoke me</b> by asking questions to refute my opinion that the fact that the sinews will ultimately harden is disregarded, <b>as I teach it</b> in explanation of <b>a lone opinion</b> (see <i>Pesaḥim</i> 84a). Even Rabbi Yoḥanan conceded that the opinion he expressed was only according to one Sage, but is not the <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> case in <b>which a bone</b> in an animal’s leg <b>broke and protruded outward.</b> This bone was mostly covered with flesh and skin, but <b>a small piece [<i>kurtita</i>]</b> of the bone <b>had been removed from it.</b> The case <b>came before Abaye,</b> who <b>delayed</b> his response until <b>three</b> pilgrimage <b>Festivals</b> had passed, when the Sages gathered together and he could ask them.
<b>Rav Adda bar Mattana said to</b> the owner of the animal: <b>Go before Rava, son of Rav Yosef bar Ḥama, whose knife is sharp,</b> i.e., he has insight into halakhic matters and decides matters quickly, and ask him to decide your case. The owner <b>came before</b> Rava to seek his opinion. Rava <b>said</b> to him: <b>Since we learned</b> in the <i>baraita</i> (76b): If <b>the bone broke and protruded outward,</b> if skin and flesh cover a majority of the bone the animal is permitted, <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if the bone <b>fell</b> out, and <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if <b>it is in</b> its place? In either case, the animal is permitted.
With regard to a case where flesh covers the majority of a broken bone, <b>Ravina said to Rava:</b> If the flesh was torn in pieces and spread over the area, and if <b>gathered</b> it would constitute a majority, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Similarly, if the flesh was <b>pulverized</b> and thin, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If it was <b>decomposed, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case in which the flesh is <b>decomposed? Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> This is referring to <b>any</b> kind of flesh <b>that the doctor cuts away [<i>kodro</i>]</b> and removes to enable the surrounding area to heal.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If the flesh that covers the bone <b>was perforated, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Likewise, if the flesh <b>was peeled</b> off the bone, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If it <b>was cracked, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If <b>the bottom third</b> of the width of the flesh, i.e., the part that is adjacent to the bone, <b>was removed, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Skin is like flesh.</b> This would appear to indicate that any covering is sufficient. The Gemara refutes this proof: <b>Perhaps</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan was referring to a specific case where there was never flesh on the bone, but only skin, e.g., adjacent to the knee, where <b>the skin holds its own</b> place close to the bone. This ruling may not apply in an area where there was flesh. Perhaps in such a place the bone must be covered by flesh that is still healthy.
<b>Rav Ashi said: While we were</b> studying <b>in Rav Pappi’s study hall, we raised a dilemma:</b> If the flesh and skin were <b>cut in the shape of a ring</b> around the break, and yet most of the circumference of the bone is surrounded by flesh, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>And we resolved</b> this dilemma <b>from this</b> statement that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: I asked</b> about <b>this matter to the Sages and to the doctors,</b> what to do when a bone breaks and the surrounding flesh has been cut away, <b>and they said: One makes an incision in it with</b> a sharp piece of <b>bone</b> to help the blood flow and then congeal, <b>and</b> in this manner the wound <b>will heal.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>But</b> one should not make the incision with <b>an iron</b> implement, <b>as it will cause inflammation. Rav Pappa said: And this</b> advice should be implemented only in a case where one can see that <b>the bone is holding</b> firmly onto <b>its</b> flesh, as only in such a case will the flesh heal.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters an animal and finds a placenta in its</b> womb, one with <b>a hearty soul [<i>nefesh hayafa</i>],</b> i.e., who is not repulsed by it, <b>may eat it,</b> as its consumption was permitted by virtue of the slaughter of the mother. Nevertheless, since generally speaking, people do not consume such placentas, it is not regarded as food <b>and</b> so it <b>cannot become impure</b> with <b>the ritual impurity of food</b> even were it to come into contact with a source of impurity. <b>And</b> furthermore, it does <b>not</b> impart <b>the ritual impurity of animal carcasses</b> as it was permitted by virtue of the slaughter of the mother. But if <b>one intended to</b> eat <b>it,</b> one thereby elevated it to the status of food, and the placenta <b>becomes impure</b> with <b>the ritual impurity of food</b> if it comes into contact with a source of impurity. <b>But</b> even so, it still does <b>not</b> impart the <b>ritual impurity of animal carcasses.</b>
With regard to <b>a placenta, part of which emerged</b> from the womb before the mother was slaughtered, its <b>consumption</b> is <b>prohibited</b> even after the mother animal is slaughtered because the emergence of the placenta is <b>an indication of a fetus in a woman and an indication of a fetus in an animal.</b> Accordingly, there is a concern that the head of the fetus might have emerged in that part of the placenta, thereby rendering the fetus as having been born, a status that precludes it from being permitted by the slaughter of its mother. Since the offspring is prohibited, its placenta is likewise prohibited.
If <b>an animal that was giving birth to its firstborn expelled a placenta, one may cast it to the dogs,</b> and one does not need to be concerned that the placenta came from a male fetus that has the consecrated status of a firstborn. <b>But in</b> the case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals the placenta <b>must be buried,</b> because it came from a fetus that is assumed to have been sacred. The mishna adds: <b>But one may neither bury it at an intersection, nor may one hang it on a tree,</b> superstitious rites intended to prevent the animal from miscarrying again, <b>due to</b> the prohibition against following <b>the ways of the Amorite,</b> which prohibits Jews from practicing the superstitious rites observed by gentiles.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the ruling that a placenta is permitted by virtue of the mother’s slaughter, the Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught:</b> “And <b>every</b> animal that parts the hoof, and has the hooves wholly cloven in two, and chews the cud, <b>of the animals, it you may eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:6). The verse is the source of the <i>halakha</i> that a fetus is permitted by virtue of the mother’s slaughter (see 69a). The word “every” at the beginning of the verse serves <b>to include the placenta</b> as well as the fetus. One <b>might</b> have thought that a placenta is permitted <b>even if part of it emerged</b> from the womb before slaughter. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “It</b> you may eat,” i.e., you may eat <b>it,</b> the slaughtered animal, <b>but not its placenta,</b> if it partially emerged.
The Gemara objects: <b>Now</b> the assumption is that there is <b>no placenta without a fetus.</b> Therefore, if part of the placenta emerged, there is a concern that the head of the fetus might have emerged in that part of the placenta, thereby rendering the fetus as having been born. Such a status would preclude it from being permitted by the slaughter of its mother. <b>Why do I</b> need a verse to teach this? The Gemara explains: The <b>verse is a mere support</b> for the <i>halakha</i>, but not the source for it.
§ The mishna states: <b>And</b> a placenta found inside a slaughtered animal <b>cannot become impure</b> with the ritual impurity of food and does not impart the ritual impurity of animal carcasses. In a related discussion, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Nappaḥa raises a dilemma: A donkey hide that one cooked</b> and it became softened, <b>what is</b> its halakhic status? The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> issue did he raise this dilemma? <b>If</b> it was <b>with regard to the ritual impurity of food, we</b> already <b>learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a <i>baraita</i>,

Daf 77b

and <b>if</b> you say it was <b>with regard to the ritual impurity of animal carcasses, we</b> already <b>learn</b> that <i>halakha</i> as well in another <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara elaborates: With regard to the <b>ritual impurity of food,</b> it is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The hide and the placenta</b> of an animal, which people do not typically eat, <b>cannot become impure</b> with the <b>ritual impurity of foods.</b> But <b>a hide that one cooked</b> until it became edible <b>and a placenta that one intended</b> to eat <b>can become impure</b> with the <b>impurity of foods.</b>
With regard to <b>the ritual impurity of animal carcasses also, we</b> already <b>learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And when a domesticated animal dies, of those that you eat, one who touches <b>its carcass</b> shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The verse indicates that one is rendered impure if he touches its carcass, <b>but not</b> if he touches its <b>hide, and not its bones, and not</b> its <b>sinews, and not</b> its <b>horns, and not</b> its <b>hooves.</b>
<b>And Rabba bar Rav Ḥana said</b> with regard to this <i>baraita</i>: This derivation <b>is necessary only</b> for a case in <b>which one prepared</b> these parts of the animal as a meat <b>pudding [<i>tzikei kedera</i>],</b> in which they are cooked for an extended period and spices are added. One might have thought they would be considered edible flesh and therefore impart the impurity of a carcass. The <i>baraita</i> therefore teaches that this is not so.
Given these two <i>baraitot</i>, why did Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa inquire about the status of the cooked hide of a donkey? The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa was inquiring about <b>the impurity of foods, and</b> although the <i>halakha</i> was already taught in the first <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa thought it is possible that <b>the hide of a donkey is different, as it is repulsive</b> and perhaps even when cooked it is not regarded as food.
§ The mishna states: With regard to <b>a placenta,</b> part of <b>which emerged</b> from the womb before the mother was slaughtered, its consumption is prohibited, as there is a concern that the head of the fetus might have emerged in that part of the placenta. Commenting on this mishna, <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where there was no fetus</b> found <b>in</b> the mother’s womb. <b>But if there was a fetus</b> with its head and the majority of its body <b>in</b> the womb, <b>one</b> need <b>not be concerned for</b> the existence of <b>another fetus</b> that might have been in the placenta. Therefore, the consumption of the placenta is permitted. <b>But Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Whether there was no fetus</b> found <b>in</b> the womb, or <b>whether there was a fetus, one</b> needs to <b>be concerned for</b> the existence of <b>another fetus</b> in the placenta, and therefore its consumption is prohibited.
According to the way the Gemara records the dispute, Rabbi Yoḥanan rules stringently and Rabbi Elazar rules leniently. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rabbi Yirmeya say</b> concerning this dispute: <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> an explanation of the mishna that presents <b>a stringency?</b>
<b>Rather, if it was stated, it was stated like this: Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The ruling of the mishna is that the placenta is prohibited even if a fetus is found inside the womb. But the Sages <b>taught</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the placenta <b>is not attached to</b> the <b>fetus</b> found inside. Consequently, one must be concerned with the possibility that the placenta came from another fetus that already left the womb, and it is therefore prohibited. <b>But if it is attached to</b> the <b>fetus</b> found inside, <b>there is no concern for</b> the possibility that the placenta came from <b>another fetus,</b> and therefore it is permitted.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In my understanding of the mishna, <b>we have</b> the ruling that the placenta is prohibited <b>only</b> in a case where there is <b>a placenta without</b> any <b>fetus</b> being found. <b>But if a fetus was</b> found <b>with it,</b> then <b>whether it is attached to the fetus</b> or <b>whether it is not attached to the fetus, there is no concern for</b> the existence of <b>another fetus.</b> The Gemara confirms: <b>And this</b> understanding of the two opinions <b>is</b> in line with that which <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says: Rabbi Elazar said</b> an explanation of the mishna that presents <b>a stringency.</b>
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar:</b> The periods of purity and impurity observed by a woman after giving birth apply only after delivering a fetus with a human form. With regard to a woman <b>who expels</b> a fetus that has the form of <b>a type of domesticated animal, undomesticated animal, or bird, and</b> there is <b>a placenta with them,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: <b>When</b> the placenta is <b>attached to them, there is no concern for</b> the existence of <b>another fetus</b> that may have had a human form. But if the placenta is <b>not attached to them,</b> it is possible there was another fetus that had a human form and so <b>I</b> must <b>impose upon</b> the woman <b>the severity of two</b> types of <b>births,</b> i.e., both the longer period of impurity observed after delivering a female, and the shorter period of purity observed after delivering a male.
The reason is <b>that I</b> can <b>say:</b> Perhaps the placenta that was found did not come from the fetus that was found, but from a fetus with a human form. To say this one must be concerned with the possibility that <b>perhaps</b> the <b>fetus of</b> the <b>placenta</b> that was found had a human form, and that fetus <b>dissolved,</b> and <b>perhaps</b> the <b>placenta of</b> the <b>fetus</b> that was found <b>dissolved.</b>
§ The mishna states: If <b>an animal that was giving birth to its firstborn expelled</b> a placenta, one may cast it to the dogs. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this ruling? <b>Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, said: The majority of domesticated animals give birth to something that</b> can be <b>consecrated</b> with <b>firstborn status,</b> i.e., an animal with the same form as its mother, <b>but a minority of animals</b> give birth to <b>something that cannot</b> be consecrated with <b>firstborn status, and what is this?</b> It is an animal that <b>resembles</b> a species other than that of its mother.
<b>And</b> furthermore, with regard to <b>all gestating</b> animals, when they <b>give birth, half</b> of their offspring are <b>male and half</b> are <b>female.</b> Therefore, one can <b>combine the minority</b> of animals that <b>resemble</b> another species <b>with the half</b> that are <b>females, and</b> arrive at the conclusion that <b>male</b> offspring that resemble their species, which are the only offspring that can be consecrated with firstborn status, <b>are the minority.</b> Accordingly, one does not need to be concerned that the placenta found was from an animal consecrated with the status of a firstborn.
§ The continuation of the mishna states: <b>But in</b> the case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals the placenta <b>must be buried,</b> because it came from a fetus that is assumed to have been sacred. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> to assume this? The Gemara answers: It is because the <b>majority</b> of the offspring of sacrificial animals <b>are fit to be sacred,</b> as, in contrast to firstborn status, both female and male offspring of sacrificial animals can be sacred. Therefore, one must be concerned that the offspring, and its placenta, were sacred.
§ The mishna adds: <b>But one may neither bury it</b> at an intersection, nor may one hang it on a tree, due to the prohibition against following the ways of the Amorite. The Gemara cites <b>Abaye and Rava, who both said: Anything that has</b> an apparently effective <b>medicinal</b> purpose or any other logical reason behind it <b>is not subject to</b> the prohibition against following <b>the ways of the Amorite.</b> But if <b>it does not have</b> an apparently effective <b>medicinal</b> purpose <b>it is subject to</b> the prohibition against following <b>the ways of the Amorite.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there is <b>a tree that sheds its fruit</b> prematurely, <b>one may paint it with red paint and load it with stones,</b> even though this is the practice of the Amorites? The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Granted,</b> it is permitted <b>to load it with stones,</b> as one does so for a logical reason, <b>in order</b>

Daf 78a

<b>that</b> the tree’s <b>strength will lessen.</b> It is possible that the tree shed its fruits prematurely due to excessive blossoming. It taxes the tree to sustain these blossoms, and this may render the tree incapable of sustaining the fruits that subsequently grow from the blossoms. Stones were used to weaken the tree during blossoming, thereby reducing the number of blossoms that it needed to nourish. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>painting it with red paint, for what</b> benefit is it performed that makes it permitted despite the fact that this was the practice of the Amorites? The Gemara explains: One does so <b>in order that people will see</b> the tree <b>and pray for it.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is derived from the verse: <b>“And he will cry: Impure, impure”</b> (Leviticus 13:45), that a leper must publicize the fact that he is ritually impure. <b>He must announce</b> his pain <b>to the masses, and the masses will pray for mercy on his behalf. And likewise, one to whom</b> any unfortunate <b>matter happens must announce</b> it <b>to the masses, and</b> then <b>the masses will pray for mercy on his behalf.</b>
<b>Ravina said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do we hang bunches of</b> unripe <b>dates on a palm tree</b> that casts off its dates, despite the fact that this is the practice of the Amorites? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> just cited, who states that one must announce such occurrences to the masses so that they will pray for mercy.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring applies both in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, both <b>in the presence,</b> i.e., the time, <b>of the Temple and not in the presence of the Temple,</b> and it applies <b>with regard to non-sacred</b> animals <b>and with regard to sacrificial</b> animals.
<b>How so?</b> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>itself and its offspring,</b> both of which are <b>non-sacred,</b> and slaughters them <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>both of</b> the animals <b>are fit</b> for consumption, <b>but</b> for slaughtering <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs [<i>sofeg</i>] the forty</b> lashes for violating the prohibition: “You shall not slaughter it and its offspring both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28).
If both animals were <b>sacrificial</b> animals slaughtered <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>then</b> for slaughtering <b>the first</b> animal, <b>one is liable</b> to receive <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>].</b> For slaughtering the second animal one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i>. The second animal was not fit for sacrifice, since one may not slaughter an animal and its offspring on the same day. <b>And both</b> animals <b>are disqualified</b> for use as offerings, <b>and</b> for the slaughter of <b>both of them, one incurs forty</b> lashes apiece: The first being a sacrificial animal slaughtered outside the courtyard and the second being the offspring of an animal slaughtered that day.
If both animals were <b>non-sacred and</b> slaughtered <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>both of them are unfit</b> to be sacrificed, being non-sacred animals slaughtered in the courtyard. <b>And</b> for slaughter of <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes for slaughtering an animal and its offspring on a single day. If both animals were <b>sacrificial</b> animals slaughtered <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>the first is fit</b> for sacrifice, <b>and</b> one who slaughters it is <b>exempt</b> from any punishment. <b>But</b> for slaughter of <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes for slaughtering an animal and its offspring on a single day, <b>and</b> it is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice, because one was not allowed to slaughter it on that day.
If the first animal was <b>non-sacred and</b> the second <b>a sacrificial</b> animal, and both were slaughtered <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>the first is fit</b> for consumption <b>and</b> one who slaughters it is <b>exempt</b> from any punishment. <b>But</b> for slaughtering <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes for slaughtering an animal and its offspring on a single day, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice.
If the first animal was <b>a sacrificial</b> animal <b>and</b> the second was <b>non-sacred</b> and both were slaughtered <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, for <b>the first</b> animal, <b>one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> for slaughtering a sacrificial animal outside the courtyard, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice. <b>And the second is fit</b> for consumption; <b>and</b> for the slaughter of <b>both of them</b> one <b>incurs forty</b> lashes apiece: The first being a sacrificial animal slaughtered outside the courtyard and the second being the offspring of an animal slaughtered that day.
If the first animal was <b>non-sacred and</b> the second was <b>a sacrificial</b> animal and both were slaughtered <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>both of them are unfit</b> for sacrifice. <b>And</b> for slaughtering <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes. If the first animal was <b>a sacrificial</b> animal <b>and</b> the second was <b>non-sacred</b> and both were slaughtered <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>the first is fit</b> for sacrifice <b>and</b> one who slaughters it is <b>exempt</b> from any punishment. <b>And</b> for slaughtering <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice, as it is non-sacred.
If both animals were <b>non-sacred,</b> and one slaughters them, the first <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and</b> the second <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>the first is fit</b> for consumption <b>and</b> one who slaughters it is <b>exempt</b> from any punishment. <b>And</b> for slaughtering <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes for slaughtering an animal and its offspring on a single day, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice as it is non-sacred.
If both animals were <b>sacrificial</b> animals, and one slaughters them, the first <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and</b> the second <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, for slaughtering <b>the first</b> animal <b>one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>, and</b> for slaughtering <b>both of them one incurs forty</b> lashes apiece. One set of lashes is given because the first was a sacrificial animal slaughtered outside the courtyard, and the second set of lashes is given because the second animal is the offspring of an animal slaughtered that day. <b>And both of them are unfit</b> for sacrifice.
If both animals were <b>non-sacred,</b> and one slaughters them, the first <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and</b> the second <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>the first is unfit</b> for sacrifice, as it is non-sacred, <b>and</b> the one who slaughters it is <b>exempt.

If both animals were <b>sacrificial</b> animals, and one slaughters them, the first <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and</b> the second <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>the first is fit</b> for sacrifice <b>and</b> one who slaughters it is <b>exempt. And</b> for <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice because its requisite time has not yet arrived.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring</b> in a single day <b>applies to sacrificial</b> animals? It is derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat, is born</b>…but from the eighth day and forward it may be accepted for an offering…to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27), <b>and it is written</b> in the <b>following</b> verse: <b>“And whether it be a bull or a sheep, you shall not slaughter it and its offspring both in one day.”</b> The juxtaposition of the verses <b>teaches with regard to</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring that it applies to sacrificial</b> animals as well.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> since this prohibition is taught in the context of other <i>halakhot</i> of consecrated animals, perhaps <b>I will say: Yes,</b> it applies <b>to sacrificial</b> animals, but it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to non-sacred</b> animals. The Gemara explains: The repetitive phrase “and whether it be <b>a bull</b> or a sheep” in the second verse, when those types of animals, i.e., bulls and sheep, were already mentioned in the first verse, <b>interrupted the topic,</b> clarifying that the second verse is not referring to sacrificial animals.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if so, <b>I will say: Yes,</b> the prohibition applies <b>to non-sacred</b> animals, but it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to sacrificial</b> animals. The Gemara explains: Since in that verse <b>it is written: “And whether it be a bull</b>…you shall not slaughter it and its offspring,” the conjunction <b>“and” adds</b> the prohibition stated in the second verse <b>to the first matter,</b> including sacrificial animals as well.
The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> this prohibition also applies to sacrificial animals, perhaps <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, the offspring of <b>diverse kinds</b> is <b>not</b> included, e.g., the offspring of a ewe and a goat is unfit to be an offering, <b>so too</b> with regard to the prohibition of: <b>A mother and its offspring,</b> the offspring of <b>diverse kinds</b> should <b>not</b> be included, so that in the case of the offspring of a ewe and a goat, it would be permitted to slaughter the mother and offspring on the same day. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (see <i>Tosefta</i> 5:1): The prohibition of: <b>A mother and its offspring, applies to</b> the offspring of <b>diverse kinds and to a <i>koy</i>,</b> a kosher animal with characteristics of both domesticated and undomesticated animals?
<b>And additionally,</b> why should the prohibition of: A mother and its offspring, apply to the offspring of diverse kinds? <b>“A sheep,” is written</b> in the verse with regard to that prohibition, <b>and Rava said</b>

Daf 78b

concerning the verse: “These are the animals that you may eat: An ox, a <i>seh</i> of sheep, and a <i>seh</i> of goats” (Deuteronomy 14:4), that <b>this</b> verse <b>establishes a paradigm</b> for other cases: <b>Wherever</b> the word <b><i>seh</i> is stated</b> in the Torah, <b>it</b> serves <b>only to exclude</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds.</b> The Hebrew word <i>seh</i> denotes either a sheep or a goat. The offspring of diverse kinds, which is neither a sheep nor a goat, does not qualify as a <i>seh</i>. The Gemara answers that with regard to a mother and its offspring, <b>the verse states:</b> “Whether it be a bull <b>or</b> a sheep” (Leviticus 22:28), and the “or” is superfluous there and serves <b>to include</b> the offspring of <b>diverse kinds.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>This</b> word <b>“or” is necessary to separate</b> the prohibitions, <b>as</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say: One is not liable unless he slaughters</b> both <b>a bull and its offspring</b> and <b>a sheep and its offspring</b> in a single day. Therefore, the word “or” <b>teaches us</b> that one is liable for slaughtering either type of animal with its offspring. The Gemara responds: <b>Separating</b> the prohibitions <b>is derived from</b> the use of the words <b>“its offspring”</b> instead of their offspring.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the word “or” <b>is still necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If it were stated: A bull, and a sheep, and its offspring</b> you shall not slaughter in one day, <b>I would say:</b> One is not liable <b>unless he slaughters a bull, and a sheep, and the offspring</b> of one of them in a single day. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “A bull or a sheep…it and its offspring”</b> (Leviticus 22:28), to teach that one is liable even for slaughtering either of them and its offspring. <b>What, is it not from</b> the word <b>“or”</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>derives</b> this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is derived <b>from</b> the word <b>“it,”</b> and the offspring of diverse kinds are included in the prohibition due to the word “or.”
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> cited further in the discussion, <b>for whom</b> the word <b>“it” is superfluous</b> and can be used for this derivation, leaving the word “or” available to include the offspring of diverse kinds; <b>but according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, for whom</b> the word <b>“it” is not superfluous, from where does he</b> derive that one is <b>to separate</b> into two prohibitions slaughtering either a bull with its offspring or a sheep with its offspring? The Gemara answers that there is <b>no need</b> for <b>a verse to separate</b> them into two prohibitions, <b>as</b> Ḥananya <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yonatan.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the verse: <b>“A man who curses his father and his mother</b> shall die” (Leviticus 20:9), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable if he curses both <b>his father and his mother. From where</b> do I derive that if one curses <b>his father but not his mother,</b> or <b>his mother but not his father,</b> he is liable? The continuation of <b>the verse states: “His father and his mother he has cursed,</b> his blood is upon him.” In the first part of the verse, the word “curses” is in proximity to “his father,” and in the last part of the verse, “cursed” is in proximity to “his mother.” This teaches that the verse is referring to both a case where <b>he cursed</b> only <b>his father</b> and a case where <b>he cursed</b> only <b>his mother;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> Rabbi Yoshiya maintains that conjunctions are interpreted strictly unless the verse indicates otherwise.
<b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> There is no need for this derivation, because the phrase “his father and his mother” <b>indicates</b> that one is liable if he curses <b>both of them together, and it</b> also <b>indicates</b> that he is liable if he curses either <b>one</b> of them <b>on their own, unless the verse specifies</b> that one is liable only if he curses both <b>together.</b> An example of a verse where the Torah specifies that the <i>halakha</i> applies only to the two elements in conjunction is: “You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together” (Deuteronomy 22:10). According to Rabbi Yonatan, had the verse stated with regard to a mother and its offspring: A bull and a sheep, and not: A bull or a sheep, one would still be liable for slaughtering each with its own offspring independently. Therefore, the word “or” is superfluous, and is utilized by Ḥananya, who agrees with the opinion of Rabbi Yonatan, to include the offspring of diverse kinds in this prohibition.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the opinion of <b>Ḥananya, and what</b> is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> that were mentioned earlier? Their opinions are elucidated <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Despite the fact that the verse is written in the masculine form, the prohibition against slaughtering <b>itself and its offspring</b> in a single day <b>applies to females,</b> i.e., to a mother and its offspring, <b>but</b> it <b>does not apply to males,</b> i.e., a male animal and its offspring. <b>Ḥananya says: It applies both to males and to females.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i>? Their reasoning is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that the prohibition against slaughtering <b>a mother and its offspring would apply both to males and to females.</b> But could one not derive <b>this</b> by <b>logical inference,</b> reaching the opposite conclusion: The Torah <b>rendered one obligated here</b> not to slaughter an animal and its offspring in a single day, <b>and</b> the Torah <b>rendered one obligated with regard to a mother bird with its chicks</b> not to seize them together, but to dispatch the mother. <b>Just as when it rendered one obligated with regard to a mother bird with its chicks,</b> the obligation applies <b>to female</b> birds <b>but not to males,</b> as the verse states: “And the mother sitting on the chicks” (Deuteronomy 22:6), <b>so too, when it rendered one obligated here,</b> with regard to an animal and its offspring, the obligation should apply <b>to female</b> animals, <b>but not to males.</b>
One may respond: <b>No, if you say</b> that this is so <b>with regard to a mother bird with its chicks, for which</b> the Torah <b>did not render prepared</b> ones equivalent <b>to unprepared</b> ones, as the obligation to dispatch the mother bird applies only where one happens to encounter a mother bird with its chicks spontaneously, but not to ones that he keeps in his property, <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is so <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of an animal <b>itself and its offspring,</b> for <b>which</b> the Torah <b>rendered prepared</b> ones equivalent <b>to unprepared</b> ones, prohibiting an animal and its offspring even if they are prepared? If so, the prohibition against slaughtering an animal and its offspring should apply to both males and females.
Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “A bull or a sheep, <b>it</b> and its offspring” (Leviticus 22:28). The superfluous word “it” indicates that this applies to only <b>one</b> parent, <b>but not</b> to <b>two.</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>After the verse separated</b> the parents, rendering the prohibition applicable to only one of them, <b>I merited</b> returning <b>to the logical inference</b> mentioned earlier: The Torah <b>rendered one obligated here</b> not to slaughter an animal and its offspring in a single day, <b>and</b> the Torah <b>rendered one obligated</b> to dispatch the mother <b>with regard to a mother bird with its chicks. Just as when it rendered one obligated with regard to a mother bird with its chicks,</b> the obligation applies <b>to females but not to males, so too, when it rendered one obligated here,</b> the obligation applies <b>to females but not to males.</b>
<b>And if it is your wish to say</b> that one can refute this, that refutation can be countered by the following derivation: The verse states: “It and <b>its offspring”</b> (Leviticus 22:28), indicating that this applies to <b>that</b> parent <b>whose offspring clings to it.</b> This serves to <b>exclude</b> the <b>male</b> parent, <b>whose offspring does not cling to it.</b>
The Gemara asks: To <b>what</b> possible refutation is the expression: <b>If it is your wish to say,</b> referring? The Gemara explains that the possible refutation is: <b>And if you would say</b> that the word <b>“it,”</b> in the verse <b>denotes a male,</b> as it is expressed in the masculine gender in the Hebrew, the response is that the verse also <b>states “its offspring”</b> in that verse, indicating that this applies to <b>that</b> parent <b>whose offspring clings to it.</b> This serves to <b>exclude</b> the <b>male</b> parent, <b>whose offspring does not cling to it.</b>

Daf 79a

<b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya,</b> the reason for his ruling is that <b>it is written “it,” which indicates a male, and it is written “its offspring,”</b> teaching that the prohibition applies to <b>that</b> parent <b>whose offspring clings to it, which indicates a female. Therefore,</b> this prohibition <b>applies to both males and females.</b>
<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥananya. And Shmuel follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 8:4): <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to two animals <b>that are born from</b> a female <b>horse, even if the father</b> of one is <b>a donkey</b> and the father of the other is a horse, <b>they are permitted</b> to mate <b>with one another.</b> Since the mothers of both are horses, the offspring are all considered of the same species. <b>But</b> to mate animals <b>that are born from</b> a female <b>donkey with</b> animals <b>that are born from</b> a female <b>horse,</b> even if one animal was born from a male horse and a female donkey and the other was born from a male donkey and a female horse, is <b>prohibited,</b> due to the prohibition of diverse kinds.
<b>And,</b> commenting on that mishna, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: This is the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, who says: One</b> need <b>not be concerned with its paternity</b> in determining the species of an animal, as the species is determined solely by the mother. <b>But the Rabbis say:</b> The species of an animal is determined according to both its mother and its father. Therefore, <b>all types of mules,</b> regardless of which parent is a horse and which is a donkey, <b>are</b> considered <b>a single</b> species and may mate with each other.
Now, <b>whose</b> opinion is referred to as that of <b>the Rabbis</b> here? <b>It is</b> that of <b>Ḥananya, who says: One</b> needs <b>to be concerned with paternity,</b> as, in his opinion, the prohibition against slaughtering an animal and its offspring applies to a male and its offspring as well. <b>And</b> therefore, with regard to the prohibition of diverse kinds as well, <b>this</b> mule that is <b>the offspring of</b> a female <b>horse and</b> a male <b>donkey, and that</b> mule that is the <b>offspring of</b> a female <b>donkey and</b> a male <b>horse are all a single species.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Is Rabbi Yehuda certain that one</b> need <b>not be concerned with its paternity</b> in determining the species of the offspring, <b>or perhaps he is uncertain</b> whether or not one need be concerned with its paternity? The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference?</b>
The Gemara answers: The practical difference is <b>with regard to permitting</b> the mating of <b>the offspring with</b> the species of <b>the mother,</b> e.g., the mating of the offspring of a female horse and a male donkey together with a horse. <b>If you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda is <b>certain</b> that one need not be concerned with its paternity, then the mating of <b>the offspring with</b> the species of <b>the mother is permitted,</b> as, in this case, they are both considered horses. <b>But if you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda is <b>uncertain,</b> then the mating of <b>the offspring with</b> the species of <b>the mother is prohibited,</b> as one must be concerned about the species of the father.
<b>What,</b> then, is the answer to the question? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a possible resolution from the mishna cited earlier: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: All that are born from</b> a female <b>horse, even if the father</b> of one <b>of them</b> is <b>a donkey, are permitted</b> to mate <b>with each other. What are the circumstances</b> here? <b>If we say that the father of this</b> male animal is <b>a donkey, and the father of that</b> female animal, with which the male is to be mated, is <b>a donkey,</b> does it <b>need to be said?</b> Since the mothers of both animals are horses, they are both of exactly the same species and may certainly mate with each other. <b>Rather, is it not that the father of this</b> one is <b>a horse, and the father of that</b> other one is <b>a donkey?</b>
<b>And</b> yet <b>it is taught</b> that <b>they are permitted</b> to mate <b>with each other. Evidently,</b> Rabbi Yehuda is <b>certain</b> that one need not be concerned with its paternity in determining the species of the offspring. If he were uncertain, he would deem their mating prohibited, as the father of one is a horse while the father of the other is a donkey.
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> one cannot cite proof from this, as it can be said <b>that actually, the father of this</b> male animal is <b>a donkey, and the father of that</b> female animal is also <b>a donkey. And</b> with regard to <b>that which you say:</b> Does it <b>need to be said</b> that these two may mate? It does need to be said, <b>lest you say: The horse component</b> of the male mule <b>comes</b> and <b>copulates with the donkey component</b> of the female mule, <b>and the donkey component</b> of the male mule <b>copulates</b> specifically <b>with the horse component</b> of the female mule, which would violate the prohibition of diverse kinds. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda <b>teaches us</b> that they are both of the same species and may mate.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a possible resolution from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>a female mule in heat, one may not mate a horse or a donkey with her,</b> due to the prohibition against crossbreeding diverse kinds of livestock. <b>Rather,</b> one mates her with <b>one of her kind,</b> another mule. <b>And if you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda is <b>certain</b> that one need not be concerned with its paternity in determining the species of the offspring, then why not <b>mate her with the species of her mother?</b> Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda is uncertain and therefore deems it prohibited to mate her with either a horse or a donkey. The Gemara responds: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where we do not know what the mother’s species is.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: Rather,</b> one mates her with <b>one of her kind,</b> indicating that her species is known. The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: One may not mate the species of a horse or the species of a donkey with her, because one does not</b> usually <b>know the species of</b> the mother of a mule that one encounters. The Gemara suggests: <b>But let one check</b> her species <b>by</b> her <b>distinguishing characteristics, as Abaye says:</b> If <b>its voice is deep,</b> it is <b>the offspring of a female donkey;</b> if <b>its voice is shrill,</b> it is <b>the offspring of a female horse. And Rav Pappa says:</b> If <b>its ears are large and its tail is small,</b> it is <b>the offspring of a female donkey;</b> if <b>its ears are small and its tail is large,</b> it is <b>the offspring of a female horse.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a mule who is <b>mute, and</b> whose ears and tail are <b>lopped off,</b> and whose species cannot be determined. Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion cannot be proven from this case.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about it? Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says: All,</b> including Rabbi Yehuda, <b>agree with regard to</b> mating <b>the offspring with</b> the species of <b>its mother that it is prohibited. Conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Yehuda is <b>uncertain.</b> If he were certain that one need not be concerned with its paternity, he would deem mating the offspring with the species of its mother permitted, since the father’s species would not matter. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is so.
The Gemara relates with regard to this issue that <b>Rabbi Abba said to his servant: If you bring me mules</b> attached <b>to a wagon [<i>rispak</i>], look for those that are similar to each other</b> in their voices and the sizes of their ears and tails, <b>and bring</b> those <b>for me,</b> in order not to violate the prohibition of diverse kinds. <b>Evidently,</b> Rabbi Abba <b>holds</b> that with regard to the offspring of diverse kinds, <b>one</b> need <b>not be concerned with its paternity,</b> since, as explained earlier, these distinguishing characteristics indicate only the species of the mother.

Daf 79b

<b>And</b> in addition, he holds that these <b>distinguishing characteristics</b> apply <b>by Torah law,</b> such that they may be relied upon to allay concerns of violating even a prohibition that is mandated by Torah law.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (see <i>Tosefta</i> 5:1): The prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring applies to</b> the offspring of <b>diverse kinds</b> of animals, such as a goat and a ewe, <b>and to the <i>koy</i>,</b> even though the prohibition does not apply to undomesticated animals. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to <b>a hybrid</b> that <b>results from</b> the mating of <b>a goat and a ewe,</b> the prohibition of <b>a mother and its offspring applies;</b> with regard to <b>a <i>koy</i>,</b> the prohibition of <b>a mother and its offspring does not apply. Rav Ḥisda says: What is the <i>koy</i> about which Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis disagree?</b> It is <b>that which results from</b> the mating of <b>a goat and a doe.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> surrounding the birth of this <i>koy</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is the result <b>of a goat that mates with a doe, and she gives birth, and one slaughters her and her offspring</b> on the same day, that is difficult: <b>But doesn’t Rav Ḥisda say: All concede in</b> the case where <b>she is a doe and her offspring is a goat,</b> because she mated with a goat, <b>that</b> one who slaughters them both on the same day <b>is exempt</b> from lashes for violating the prohibition of a mother and its offspring? He is exempt because <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And whether it be a bull or <b>a sheep,</b> you shall not slaughter it <b>and its offspring</b> both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28), indicating that the prohibition applies to a domesticated animal and its offspring, <b>but not</b> to an undomesticated animal and its offspring, such as <b>a doe and its offspring.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps this <i>koy</i> is the product <b>of a deer that mates with a female goat, and she gives birth, and one slaughters her and her offspring</b> on the same day. <b>But doesn’t Rav Ḥisda say: All concede</b> that <b>in</b> the case where <b>she is a goat and her offspring is a deer</b> because she mated with a deer, <b>that</b> one who slaughters them both on the same day <b>is liable?</b> He is liable because <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“A sheep</b>…and its offspring” (Leviticus 22:28), indicating that the prohibition applies to a domesticated animal such as a sheep <b>and its offspring</b> of <b>any</b> species, even if it is an undomesticated animal.
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis is in the case <b>of a goat that mates with a doe, and she gives birth to a female offspring,</b> a <i>koy</i>, <b>and</b> this <b>female offspring gives birth to a male offspring, and one slaughters her and her male offspring</b> on the same day.
<b>The Rabbis hold: One</b> needs <b>to be concerned with its paternity,</b> and therefore the <i>koy</i> is partially a goat due to its father, <b>and</b> the word <b>“sheep”</b> in the verse means that <b>even</b> if it is <b>partially a sheep,</b> i.e., a domesticated animal, it may not be slaughtered with its offspring in a single day. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer holds: One</b> need <b>not be concerned with its paternity,</b> and the status of the <i>koy</i> is unaffected by the fact that its father is a goat, <b>and</b> therefore, in this case <b>we do not say</b> that the word <b>“sheep”</b> mentioned in the verse means that <b>even</b> if it is <b>partially a sheep</b> it may not be slaughtered with its offspring in a single day, as the father’s component is ignored.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And let them disagree</b> with regard to any animal of mixed breed <b>about</b> whether <b>one</b> needs <b>to be concerned with its paternity,</b> i.e., <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between Ḥananya and the Rabbis,</b> whether the prohibition against slaughtering an animal and its offspring on the same day also applies to a father and its offspring because one needs to be concerned with an animal’s paternity.
The Gemara responds: <b>If they would disagree</b> only <b>about that</b> issue, <b>I would say:</b> With regard to <b>this</b> issue of a doe mother and a goat father, <b>even the Rabbis concede that we do not say</b> that the word <b>“sheep”</b> mentioned in the verse means that <b>even</b> if an animal is <b>partially a sheep,</b> i.e., a domesticated animal, it may not be slaughtered with its offspring in a single day. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> teaches us that according to the Rabbis, not only does one need to be concerned with paternity, but the word “sheep” indicates that even if it is partially a sheep, i.e., a domesticated animal, it may not be slaughtered with its offspring.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But that which we learned</b> in a mishna (83b) appears to contradict this: <b>One may not slaughter a <i>koy</i> on a Festival,</b> because covering its blood entails the performance of prohibited labor that is permitted only if there is a definite obligation to do so. <b>And if one slaughtered</b> a <i>koy</i> on a Festival after the fact, <b>one does not cover its blood,</b> as the Sages prohibited transporting soil on a Festival where it is uncertain that a mitzva by Torah law exists.
The Gemara explains the question: <b>What are we dealing with? If we say</b> that we are dealing <b>with a goat who mates with a doe, and she gives birth,</b> then <b>whether according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis or according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, let him slaughter</b> the <i>koy</i> on the Festival <i>ab initio</i> <b>and cover</b> the blood, as the mother of the <i>koy</i> is <b>a deer, and</b> the <i>koy</i> therefore may be termed an undomesticated animal, whose blood requires covering. This should be so <b>even</b> if it is <b>partially a deer,</b> i.e., it has an undomesticated animal component from only one parent, since all agree that the offspring’s species derives from its mother.
<b>Rather,</b> we must be dealing <b>with</b> a case of <b>a deer that mates with a female goat, and she gives birth.</b> This, too, is difficult: <b>If</b> the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> that one needs to be concerned with paternity, <b>let him slaughter</b> this <i>koy</i> on the Festival <i>ab initio</i> <b>and cover</b> the blood, as it is partially an undomesticated animal due to its father. <b>If</b> the mishna holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> that one need not be concerned with paternity, <b>let him slaughter</b> the <i>koy</i> on the Festival <i>ab initio</i> <b>and not cover</b> the blood, as it should be considered a domesticated animal, whose blood does not require covering due to its mother who is a goat.
The Gemara concludes that <b>actually</b> this mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, and it is referring to a case <b>of a deer who mates with a female goat, and the Rabbis</b> do not say with certainty that in determining the species of an animal one must be concerned with paternity, but rather the Rabbis <b>are</b> simply <b>uncertain whether one</b> needs <b>to be concerned with its paternity or one</b> need <b>not be concerned.</b> Therefore, they rule that one should not slaughter it on a Festival, <i>ab initio</i>, in order to avoid a possible prohibition, and if one did slaughter it, he should not cover the blood, to avoid violating a prohibition in order to perform an uncertain mitzva.
The Gemara infers: <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that the Rabbis are uncertain,</b> and therefore they rule that the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, applies to a <i>koy</i>, it can be inferred that <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who rules that the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, does not apply to a <i>koy</i>, it is <b>obvious</b> that, with regard to a <i>koy</i> resulting from a deer mating with a female goat, one need not be concerned with its paternity at all.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this, <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (see <i>Tosefta</i> 9:1) presents a difficulty: The mitzva to give <b>the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw</b> of non-sacred animals to a priest <b>applies</b> both <b>to a <i>koy</i> and to</b> the offspring of <b>diverse kinds</b> of animals. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: A hybrid</b> that <b>results from</b> the mating of <b>a goat and a ewe is obligated to</b> have <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood given from it; a hybrid that results <b>from a <i>koy</i> is exempt from</b> having <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood given from it.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> type of <i>koy</i> <b>are we dealing with? If we say</b> that we are dealing <b>with a goat who mates with a doe, and she gives birth, granted,</b> this is consistent <b>according</b> to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who deems</b> it <b>exempt</b> from having gifts of the priesthood given from it. As <b>he holds</b> that <b>we do not say</b> that the word <b>“sheep”</b> (see Deuteronomy 18:3) means that <b>even</b> if it is <b>partially a sheep</b> one must give gifts of the priesthood from it, as paternity is ignored and this <i>koy</i> is considered solely the offspring of a doe, exempting it from having gifts given from it.
<b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> even if it is <b>granted that they hold</b> that the word <b>“sheep”</b> means that <b>even</b> if it is <b>partially a sheep,</b> or any other type of domesticated animal, one is obligated to give gifts of the priesthood from it, why should the owner of this <i>koy</i> be required to give the gifts to a priest? <b>Granted, he does not give</b> the priest <b>half</b> of the gifts, since half of the <i>koy</i>, i.e., the mother’s component, is an undomesticated animal; but with regard to <b>the other half,</b> as well, <b>let him say to</b> the priest: <b>Bring proof that one</b> needs <b>to be concerned with its paternity and take</b> that half; otherwise receive nothing.
<b>Rather,</b> we are dealing <b>with</b> the case of <b>a deer who mates with a female goat and she gives birth. Granted,</b> this is consistent <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who say that one is obligated to give gifts of the priesthood from it, as <b>what</b> is meant by: <b>Obligated?</b> It means: It is obligated <b>in half of the gifts,</b> since on its mother’s side the goat component is subject to the obligation to give the gifts, but with regard to the other half of the gifts he can tell the priest: Bring proof that one need not be concerned with paternity, and take it. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who says that one need not be concerned with paternity at all, such that this <i>koy</i> would be considered a domesticated animal like its mother, <b>let</b> the owner <b>be obligated in all of the gifts.</b> Why, then, does Rabbi Eliezer deem him exempt?
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> it is referring <b>to a deer who mates with a female goat, and she gives birth, and Rabbi Eliezer is also uncertain whether,</b> in determining the species of an animal, <b>one</b> needs <b>to be concerned with its paternity or not.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But since</b> the conclusion is <b>that the Rabbis are uncertain and Rabbi Eliezer is uncertain, in what</b> case <b>do they disagree</b> where Rabbi Eliezer deems the owner exempt from giving the gifts entirely?

Daf 80a

They disagree <b>concerning</b> whether the word <b>“sheep”</b> mentioned in the verses indicates that <b>even</b> if it is <b>partially a sheep,</b> it is considered a domesticated animal. <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that the word <b>“sheep”</b> indicates that <b>even</b> if it is <b>partially a sheep</b> it is considered a domesticated animal, <b>and Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that the word <b>“sheep”</b> indicates that it must be descended entirely from sheep or other domesticated animals, <b>but not partially</b> descended from <b>sheep.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa says: Therefore,</b> the cases relating to a <i>koy</i> must be interpreted in accordance with this understanding of the disagreement between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis. <b>With regard to the matter of covering the blood</b> of a <i>koy</i>, which the mishna indicates is performed due to uncertainty as to whether a <i>koy</i> is an undomesticated animal, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>the gifts</b> of the priesthood, which the Rabbis require to be given from a <i>koy</i> as from a domesticated animal, but Rabbi Eliezer does not, <b>you find</b> a way to interpret the cases <b>only</b> if they are referring <b>to</b> a <i>koy</i> resulting from <b>a deer who mates with a female goat.</b>
This is so <b>because,</b> according to the aforementioned conclusions about their opinions, <b>both according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer it is uncertain whether one</b> needs <b>to be concerned with paternity,</b> and the <i>koy</i> is considered partially an undomesticated animal, <b>or</b> one need <b>not</b> be concerned, and it is considered entirely domesticated.
<b>And they disagree as to</b> whether the word <b>“sheep”</b> means that <b>even</b> if it is <b>partially a sheep</b> it is considered a domesticated animal. Therefore, the mishna, which requires one to cover the blood of a <i>koy</i> whose father is a deer due to uncertainty, is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, because they, as opposed to Rabbi Eliezer, hold that if an animal has a domesticated component, it is considered a domesticated animal, and with regard to covering the blood if the animal has an undomesticated component, the animal is considered undomesticated. As for the gifts of the priesthood, the Rabbis require half of them to be given from this <i>koy</i>, as it has a domesticated component from its mother, while Rabbi Eliezer exempts one from giving them, as he holds that an animal’s parents must both be domesticated to qualify the animal as domesticated.
Rav Pappa continues: <b>With regard to the matter of</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring</b> on the same day, which the Rabbis hold applies to a <i>koy</i> but Rabbi Eliezer does not, <b>you find</b> such a case <b>either with regard to</b> a <i>koy</i> who is the daughter of <b>a goat who mates with a doe, or with regard to</b> a <i>koy</i> who is the daughter of <b>a deer who mates with a female goat.</b>
Rav Pappa explains: The case may be referring <b>to</b> a <i>koy</i> who is the daughter of <b>a goat who mates with a doe, and</b> it relates <b>to a prohibition,</b> i.e., whether slaughtering it and its offspring in one day is prohibited <i>ab initio</i>, <b>as the Rabbis hold: Perhaps one</b> needs <b>to be concerned with its paternity,</b> and this <i>koy</i> is therefore considered part domesticated, <b>and we say</b> that the word <b>“sheep”</b> means that <b>even</b> if it is <b>partially a sheep</b> this prohibition applies, <b>and</b> its slaughter on the same day as its daughter is <b>prohibited</b> <i>ab initio</i>, although one does not receive lashes for it as it is not a definite transgression.
<b>And Rabbi Eliezer holds: Though one indeed</b> needs <b>to be concerned with its paternity,</b> and this <i>koy</i> is considered partially domesticated, <b>we do not say</b> that the word <b>“sheep”</b> means that <b>even</b> if it is <b>partially a sheep</b> the prohibition applies. Therefore, its slaughter on the same day as its offspring is permitted.
Additionally, the case under dispute may be referring <b>to</b> a <i>koy</i> who is the daughter of <b>a deer who mates with a female goat, and</b> it relates <b>to</b> whether slaughtering it and its offspring in one day renders one liable to receive <b>lashes. The Rabbis hold: Though one indeed</b> needs <b>to be concerned with its paternity,</b> and this <i>koy</i> is considered partially undomesticated, <b>we say</b> that the word <b>“sheep”</b> means that the prohibition applies <b>even</b> if it is <b>partially a sheep,</b> such as this <i>koy</i>, <b>and</b> one who slaughters it and its offspring on one day <b>is flogged. And Rabbi Eliezer holds: There is a prohibition</b> against slaughtering this <i>koy</i> and its offspring on the same day, but if one slaughtered them <b>there are no lashes.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>There is a prohibition</b> in the case of this <i>koy</i> that is itself a mother, since <b>perhaps one</b> need <b>not be concerned with its paternity, and</b> therefore <b>this</b> <i>koy</i> <b>is a full-fledged sheep,</b> like its mother. Due to uncertainty, <b>there are no lashes</b> for violating the prohibition <b>because perhaps one</b> needs <b>to be concerned with its paternity,</b> in which case this <i>koy</i> is only a partial sheep.
<b>And</b> according to Rabbi Eliezer, <b>we do not say</b> that the word <b>“sheep”</b> means that <b>even</b> if it is <b>partially a sheep</b> it is subject to the prohibition. Therefore, one is not flogged for slaughtering this <i>koy</i> on the same day as its offspring, as lashes are administered only when the witnesses give the transgressor a definite forewarning against violating the prohibition. Since the prohibition in this case is uncertain, any forewarning would be uncertain.
§ Until this point, the Gemara considered the <i>koy</i> to be the result of interbreeding a deer and a goat. The Gemara now cites other opinions as to its identity: <b>Rav Yehuda says: A <i>koy</i> is a distinct entity, and the Sages did not determine whether it is a species of domesticated animal or a species of undomesticated animal. Rav Naḥman says: The <i>koy</i> is the wild ram.</b>
The Gemara notes that this dispute is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> cited in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The <i>koy</i> is the wild ram, and there are</b> those <b>who say:</b> It is <b>that which results from</b> the mating of <b>a goat with a doe. Rabbi Yosei says: A <i>koy</i> is a distinct entity, and the Sages did not determine whether</b> it is <b>a species of undomesticated animal or a species of domesticated animal. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: It is a species of domesticated animal, and</b> the members <b>of the house of Dushai would raise flocks</b> and <b>flocks of them,</b> as with other domesticated animals.
§ The Gemara cites a statement with regard to goats: <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav Safra says</b> that <b>Rav Hamnuna says</b> that <b>these forest goats,</b> i.e., wild goats, <b>are fit</b> to be sacrificed <b>on the altar,</b> as they are considered a type of goat. The Gemara comments that Rav Hamnuna <b>holds in accordance with that which Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The verse lists ten</b> kosher <b>animals, and no more.</b> He is referring to the verses: “These are the animals that you may eat: An ox, a <i>seh</i> of sheep, and a <i>seh</i> of goats, a deer, and a gazelle, and a fallow deer, and a wild goat, and an oryx, and an aurochs, and a wild sheep” (Deuteronomy 14:4–5). The first three are domesticated animals, while the other seven are undomesticated animals.
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>these</b> forest goats, <b>since they are not reckoned among the undomesticated animals, learn from it that they are</b> a type <b>of goat,</b> as they are also called goats and have a goat-like appearance. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov objects to this:</b> Perhaps wild goats are a different species of undomesticated animal not explicitly mentioned in the verse, as the next verse provides a more general description, <b>and I will say</b> that the verse: <b>“A deer and a gazelle,</b> etc.,” is a list of undomesticated animals, each of which is a specific <b>detail.</b> The next verse: “And <b>any animal,”</b> is <b>a generalization.</b>
According to the principles for explicating verses, when there is <b>a detail and</b> then <b>a generalization,</b> the <b>generalization was made to expand beyond the detail.</b> Therefore, <b>there are more</b> species of kosher undomesticated animals than the verse lists, one of which may be forest goats.
The Gemara responds: <b>If so, why do I</b> need <b>all of these details?</b> The mention of a single undomesticated animal and then the generalization should suffice for applying the principle of: A detail and a generalization. Rather, these are the only kosher undomesticated animals, and the forest goat must therefore be a type of domesticated goat. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, objects to this: But</b> even if forest goats are not a different type of undomesticated animal from those mentioned in the verse, <b>perhaps they are a type of wild goat,</b> one of the undomesticated animals mentioned in the verse, rather than a type of domesticated goat.
With regard to this topic, <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya,</b> who said <b>to Rav Ashi: Perhaps they are a type of aurochs [<i>te’o</i>], or a type of wild sheep,</b> which are also undomesticated animals. <b>Rav Ḥanan said to Rav Ashi:</b> Differing from Rav Hamnuna’s opinion, <b>Ameimar deems</b> the consumption of <b>their fat permitted,</b> which is prohibited with regard to domesticated animals, indicating that he considers forest goats a species of undomesticated animal.
<b>Abba, son of Rav Minyamin bar Ḥiyya, inquired of Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> offering <b>these forest goats [<i>izei devala</i>] on the altar?</b> Are they domesticated animals that may be sacrificed? Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya <b>said to him: Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis disagree only with regard to the wild ox.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 8:6): <b>The wild ox is a species of domesticated animal. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It is <b>a species of undomesticated animal. As the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> “aurochs” (Deuteronomy 14:5) <b>is translated</b> into Aramaic as: <b>Forest ox [<i>turbala</i>],</b> it can be understood that the wild ox <b>is a species of domesticated animal, and Rabbi Yosei holds: From</b> the fact <b>that it is reckoned among the undomesticated animals,</b> it can be derived that <b>it is a species of undomesticated animal. But</b> with regard to <b>these</b> forest goats, which are not reckoned among the undomesticated animals, <b>all agree</b> that <b>they are a type of goat</b> and are fit to be sacrificed upon the altar.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, objects to this: But perhaps they are a type of wild goat.</b> Similarly, <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: But perhaps they are a type of aurochs, or a type of wild sheep.</b> Additionally, <b>Rav Naḥman said to Rav Ashi: Ameimar deems</b> the consumption of <b>their fat permitted,</b> which is prohibited with regard to domesticated animals, as he considers them undomesticated animals.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>How so? One who slaughters</b> an animal itself and its offspring, etc. <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: The entire mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. From where</b> is this derived? It is derived <b>from that</b> which the mishna <b>teaches:</b> If both animals were <b>sacrificial</b> animals slaughtered <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>then</b> for slaughtering <b>the first</b> animal, <b>one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>. And both</b> animals <b>are disqualified</b> for use as offerings, <b>and</b> for the slaughter of <b>both of them, one incurs forty</b> lashes. <b>Since we have heard that Rabbi Shimon says:</b> An act of <b>slaughter that is unfit</b> to permit consumption of the meat <b>is not considered</b> to have the halakhic status of an act of <b>slaughter.</b>

Daf 80b

Therefore, when one slaughters a mother and its offspring that are both sacrificial animals outside the Temple courtyard, with regard to <b>the first,</b> it is as if <b>he has</b> simply <b>killed it</b> without ritual slaughter, since being slaughtered outside the Temple courtyard renders it unfit. Accordingly, <b>the second</b> would have been fit to be <b>accepted within</b> the Temple, and there would have been no prohibition against slaughtering it on that day. If so, when he slaughtered it outside the courtyard, why is he liable only to receive lashes? <b>Let him also be liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>.</b>
Likewise, the same question may be asked with regard to what is taught in the mishna: If both animals were <b>non-sacred</b> and they were slaughtered <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>both of them are unfit</b> for sacrifice. <b>And</b> for the slaughter of <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes. <b>Since we have heard that Rabbi Shimon says:</b> An act of <b>slaughter that is unfit is not considered</b> to have the halakhic status of an act of <b>slaughter,</b> with regard to <b>the first</b> animal, it is as if <b>he has</b> simply <b>killed it</b> without ritual slaughter, since a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard is rendered unfit, as deriving benefit from it is prohibited. If so, <b>why,</b> for the slaughter of <b>the second</b> animal, <b>does one incur the forty</b> lashes?
Similarly, the mishna teaches: If both animals were <b>sacrificial</b> animals slaughtered <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>the first is fit</b> for sacrifice, <b>and</b> one who slaughters it is <b>exempt</b> from any punishment. <b>But</b> for the slaughter of <b>the second</b> animal, <b>one incurs the forty</b> lashes for the slaughter of an animal and its offspring on a single day, <b>and</b> it is <b>unfit</b> for sacrifice.
<b>Since we have heard that Rabbi Shimon says:</b> An act of <b>slaughter that is unfit</b> to permit consumption of the animal <b>is not considered</b> to have the halakhic status of an act of <b>slaughter.</b> One can then raise the question: An act of <b>slaughter of sacrificial</b> animals <b>is also</b> considered an act of <b>slaughter that is unfit, because as long as one has not sprinkled the blood, the meat is not permitted</b> to be burned on the altar or eaten. Since slaughtering the first animal is not considered slaughtering, <b>why,</b> for slaughtering <b>the second</b> animal, <b>does one incur the forty</b> lashes for slaughtering an animal and its offspring on a single day, <b>and</b> why is it <b>unfit? Rather, conclude from</b> this analysis <b>that</b> the mishna <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious that this is so?</b> There is no need for this long analysis. The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary for</b> Rabbi Oshaya to mention that the mishna is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon due to the case of <b>slaughtering</b> an animal and its offspring that are <b>sacrificial</b> animals inside the Temple courtyard. This is because it may <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>slaughtering sacrificial</b> animals <b>is</b> considered <b>an</b> act of <b>slaughtering</b> that is <b>fit, because if he stabbed</b> the animal to death <b>and sprinkled</b> its <b>blood, the meat is not permitted, but if he slaughtered</b> it, <b>the meat is permitted and it is</b> considered <b>slaughtering</b> that is <b>fit</b> according to Rabbi Shimon. Therefore, he <b>teaches us</b> that it is not fit.
§ With regard to the ruling that one who slaughters an animal and its offspring that are sacrificial animals inside the Temple courtyard receives lashes for violating the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, when slaughtering the second animal, the Gemara suggests: <b>And let him be flogged also for</b> violating <b>the prohibition against</b> sacrificing an animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, since it is forbidden to sacrifice it until the next day. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to all of the disqualifications of the bull,</b> i.e., any feature that disqualifies cattle brought as offerings, <b>and of the lamb,</b> i.e., sheep brought as offerings, <b>that</b> if one consecrates, slaughters, or burns on the altar an animal so disqualified, <b>he</b> violates the prohibition <b>of: It shall not be accepted,</b> and is flogged?
It is derived from the fact that, in the middle of the passage prohibiting blemished animals from being sacrificed upon the altar, <b>the verse states: “Either a bull or a lamb that has anything too long or too short…</b>but for a vow it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 22:23). Since this passage is already discussing a bull and lamb, it is unnecessary to mention them. Rather, this verse <b>taught about</b> all of <b>the disqualifications of the bull and of the lamb,</b> including that of an animal whose time has not yet arrived, <b>that</b> if one offers an animal with one of those disqualifications, <b>he</b> violates the prohibition <b>of: It shall not be accepted.</b>
The Gemara answers: He receives lashes for violating that prohibition as well, but <b>when</b> the mishna <b>lists</b> the prohibitions violated by the actions described, it lists only <b>prohibitions</b> related to the prohibition <b>of: Itself and its offspring,</b> but <b>it does not list unrelated prohibitions.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does the mishna <b>not</b> list unrelated prohibitions? <b>But</b> there are prohibitions with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals slaughtered <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>which are unrelated prohibitions, and it lists them. As it teaches:</b> If both animals were <b>sacrificial</b> animals slaughtered <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>then</b> for slaughtering <b>the first</b> animal, <b>one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i>.</b> And both animals are disqualified for use as offerings, <b>and</b> for the slaughter of <b>both of them one incurs forty</b> lashes apiece.
<b>Granted,</b> with regard to the <b>second</b> animal one is flogged <b>due to the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring. But</b> with regard to the <b>first</b> animal, <b>why does he incur</b> the forty lashes? <b>Isn’t it due to the prohibition of</b> consecrated animals <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple courtyard? Therefore, with regard to the case of sacrificial animals slaughtered inside the Temple courtyard, the mishna should also have mentioned the unrelated prohibition of: It shall not be accepted.
The Gemara answers: <b>Wherever there is no</b> violation of <b>the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring,</b> for slaughtering an animal, the mishna <b>lists unrelated prohibitions, but wherever there is</b> a violation of <b>the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring,</b> the mishna <b>does not list unrelated prohibitions,</b> but only the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: Leave</b> the prohibition against sacrificing an animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, <b>as the verse</b>

Daf 81a

<b>transmuted it</b> from the standard prohibition of: It shall not be accepted, which is violated in the case of the other disqualifications, <b>into</b> a prohibition that stems from <b>a positive mitzva. What is the reasoning</b> by which this is derived? It is derived from that <b>which the verse states: “From the eighth day and forward it may be accepted</b> for an offering” (Leviticus 22:27), which teaches that <b>from the eighth day</b> after its birth, <b>yes,</b> it may be sacrificed as an offering, but <b>initially,</b> before the eighth day, <b>no,</b> it may not be sacrificed. Therefore, this is <b>a prohibition that stems from a positive mitzva,</b> which is not considered a negative prohibition for which one is flogged, but rather <b>a positive mitzva.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But this</b> verse <b>is required for</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Aptoriki, as Rabbi Aptoriki raises a contradiction: It is written: “Then it shall be seven days with its mother”</b> (Leviticus 22:27), indicating that on <b>the night</b> after the seventh day it is already <b>fit</b> to be sacrificed. <b>But it is</b> also <b>written</b> in that verse: <b>“From the eighth day and forward it may be accepted,”</b> indicating that <b>from the eighth day forward, yes,</b> it is fit, but on <b>the night</b> before it is <b>not.</b>
<b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>The night</b> after the seventh day is fit <b>for consecration,</b> which is permitted at that time, while <b>the</b> eighth <b>day</b> is fit <b>for effecting acceptance,</b> and only then may it be sacrificed on the altar. The Gemara answers that <b>another verse is</b> also <b>written</b> that specifies this positive mitzva: <b>“So shall you do with your ox and with your sheep;</b> seven days shall it be with its mother; on the eighth day you shall give it to Me” (Exodus 22:29).
§ The Gemara returns to discussing Rabbi Shimon’s opinion with regard to slaughtering an animal and its offspring on the same day. <b>Rav Hamnuna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon would say:</b> The prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring does not apply to sacrificial</b> animals. <b>What is the reason?</b> The reason is that <b>since Rabbi Shimon says</b> that an act of <b>slaughter that is unfit</b> to permit consumption <b>is not considered</b> to have the halakhic status of an act of <b>slaughter,</b> the prohibition will not apply here. This case of <b>slaughtering sacrificial</b> animals <b>is also</b> considered <b>slaughter that is unfit,</b> in that the flesh may not be burned upon the altar or eaten until the blood has been presented.
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If one slaughtered an animal <b>itself and its offspring</b> and both animals were <b>sacrificial</b> animals slaughtered <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> For slaughtering the <b>second</b> animal he transgresses <b>a prohibition</b> in slaughtering it outside the Temple, <b>as Rabbi Shimon would say:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> offering <b>that is fit to come</b> to the altar <b>after</b> a certain amount of <b>time</b> and is offered outside the Temple before that time, <b>he</b> who slaughters it transgresses <b>a prohibition, but there is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i>. And the Rabbis say:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> offering slaughtered outside of the Temple <b>for which there is no</b> liability to receive <b><i>karet</i></b> because it is unfit to be an offering at that time, he who sacrifices it also <b>does not</b> transgress <b>a prohibition.</b>
<b>And</b> this statement in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>difficult for us:</b> If both animals were <b>sacrificial</b> animals slaughtered <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, Rabbi Shimon says: For slaughtering the <b>second</b> animal he transgresses <b>a prohibition</b> for slaughtering outside the Temple. According to Rabbi Shimon, slaughter that is unfit for consumption is not considered slaughter. Therefore, with regard to <b>the first</b> animal, it is as if <b>he has killed</b> it without ritual slaughter, since its slaughter was unfit, and the <b>second</b> animal <b>would be accepted inside</b> the Temple upon the altar. Therefore, <b>let</b> one who slaughters it outside of the Temple <b>be liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> as well.</b>
<b>And Rava said, and some say it unattributed:</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and this is what</b> it is <b>teaching:</b> If one slaughters an animal and its offspring that are both <b>sacrificial</b> animals, and <b>both of them</b> are slaughtered <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> the slaughter of <b>the first</b> animal <b>is punishable by <i>karet</i>,</b> while the <b>second</b> animal <b>is disqualified</b> as its time has not yet arrived, <b>and</b> therefore, for its slaughter one is <b>exempt from</b> punishment for violating <b>the prohibition of</b> offerings <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple.
<b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> the slaughter of <b>both of them,</b> including the second one alone, is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>.</b> This is because the slaughter of the first is not considered slaughter, and therefore it does not disqualify the second through the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring.
If an animal and its offspring that are sacrificial animals are slaughtered, the first <b>one outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>and</b> the second <b>one inside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> the slaughter of the <b>first is punishable by <i>karet</i>,</b> while the <b>second</b> animal <b>is disqualified</b> as its time has not yet arrived, <b>and</b> its slaughterer is <b>exempt</b> from punishment for its slaughter outside the Temple, because he slaughtered it inside the Temple. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> the <b>second</b> animal is <b>fit</b> for the altar, and it is sacrificed, as the slaughter of the first animal is not considered slaughter, and therefore the slaughter of the second does not violate the prohibition of a mother and its offspring.
If an animal and its offspring that are sacrificial animals are slaughtered, the first <b>one inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>and</b> the second <b>one outside</b> the Temple courtyard, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> the <b>first</b> animal <b>is fit</b> for the altar, <b>and</b> one who slaughters it <b>is exempt</b> from any punishment, as its slaughter is perfectly legitimate. The <b>second is unfit</b> for the altar, as it was slaughtered outside the Temple, <b>but</b> its slaughterer is <b>exempt</b> from punishment for its slaughter outside the Temple because it is unfit for the altar, as its time has not yet arrived. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> for slaughtering the <b>second</b> animal outside the Temple one transgresses <b>a prohibition,</b> as he holds that an offering whose time has not yet arrived that was slaughtered outside the Temple violates a prohibition.
Rava now explains his objection: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the prohibition of: <b>Itself and its offspring,</b> does <b>not apply to sacrificial</b> animals, then with regard to slaughtering the <b>second</b> animal outside the Temple, <b>why</b> does one transgress only <b>a prohibition and nothing more? Let him be liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> as well,</b> as since its slaughter does not violate the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, it would fit to be sacrificed inside the Temple. Therefore, it is clear that the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, does apply to sacrificial animals.
<b>Rather, Rava said: This is what Rav Hamnuna is saying:</b> Though the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, does apply to sacrificial animals, the administering of <b>lashes for</b> violating the prohibition of: <b>Itself and its offspring, does not apply to sacrificial animals.</b>
The reason is that <b>since as long as one has not sprinkled the blood, the flesh is not permitted</b> to be burned on the altar or eaten, <b>at the time that one slaughters</b> the second animal, when he receives a forewarning that his action violates the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, <b>it is an uncertain forewarning,</b> because if the blood will not be sprinkled, the flesh will not be permitted, sparing him from violating the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring. <b>And an uncertain forewarning is not considered</b> a valid <b>forewarning</b> that renders one liable to receive lashes.
<b>And Rava follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rava says:</b> According to Rabbi Shimon, who holds that one does not incur punishment for the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, for a slaughtering that is unfit, if <b>she,</b> the mother, <b>is non-sacred, and her offspring is a peace offering,</b> and one <b>slaughtered</b> the <b>non-sacred</b> mother, <b>and afterward</b> one <b>slaughtered</b> her offspring that is <b>a peace offering</b> on the same day, he is <b>exempt</b> for slaughtering the offspring. This is because the forewarning for slaughtering the offspring is uncertain as its blood might not be sprinkled, rendering the slaughter unfit.
But if one slaughtered the offspring that is <b>a peace offering</b> first and sprinkled its blood, <b>and afterward</b> he slaughtered the <b>non-sacred</b> mother, he is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes for slaughtering the mother. Once the non-sacred mother is slaughtered, the meat is fit; therefore, the forewarning is definite. <b>And Rava says:</b> If <b>she,</b> the mother, <b>is non-sacred, and her offspring is</b> sacrificed as <b>a burnt offering,</b> and both are slaughtered on the same day, <b>it is not necessary</b> to state that if one <b>slaughtered</b> the <b>non-sacred</b> mother, <b>and afterward</b> he <b>slaughtered</b> her offspring as <b>a burnt offering, that</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>

Daf 81b

<b>But even</b> if one <b>slaughtered</b> the offspring as <b>a burnt offering</b> and sprinkled its blood, <b>and afterward slaughtered</b> the <b>non-sacred</b> mother, he is <b>exempt.</b> The reason is that <b>the slaughter</b> of the <b>first</b> animal <b>is not</b> an act of <b>slaughter subject to consumption,</b> as a burnt offering is entirely burned upon the altar, and according to Rabbi Shimon, it is an act of slaughter that is improper, in that it does not render the meat fit to be eaten, is not considered slaughter.
<b>And Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says: <b>Consumption by the altar is considered consumption. What is the reason?</b> The reason is <b>that the verse states</b> with regard to an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time [<i>piggul</i>]: <b>“And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be at all eaten [<i>he’akhol ye’akhel</i>]</b> on the third day, it shall not be accepted” (Leviticus 7:18).
The repetitive expression “<i>he’akhol ye’akhel</i>” teaches that <b>the verse is speaking of two</b> types of <b>consumption: One</b> is <b>human consumption, and</b> the other <b>one</b> is <b>consumption by the altar,</b> and both are considered consumption with regard to <i>piggul</i> and other matters. Therefore, the slaughter of a burnt offering is considered slaughter that is fit for consumption, and the slaughter of a mother animal and its offspring, one of which is sacrificed as a burnt offering on the same day as the slaughter of the other, renders one liable to receive lashes even according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal and its offspring <b>and</b> one of them <b>is discovered to be an animal with a wound that would have caused it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>]</b> and may not be eaten, or <b>one who slaughters</b> one of the animals <b>for</b> the sake of <b>idol worship,</b> from which deriving benefit is prohibited, <b>or one who slaughters the</b> red <b>heifer of purification, or an ox that</b> was <b>to</b> have been <b>stoned, or a heifer whose neck</b> was <b>to</b> have been <b>broken,</b> all of which are animals from which deriving benefit is prohibited, <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> one who slaughters them <b>exempt</b> from lashes for the slaughter of a mother and its offspring, as in his opinion, slaughter that does not render the animal fit for consumption is not considered slaughter and does not violate the prohibition. <b>And the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>liable,</b> as the slaughter need not render the animal fit for consumption in order to violate the prohibition.
All agree that <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>and it becomes a carcass by his hand</b> because the slaughter was invalid, <b>or one who stabs</b> an animal, <b>or one who uproots</b> the windpipe and the gullet, is <b>exempt with regard to</b> the prohibition against slaughtering <b>a mother and its offspring,</b> as it is written: “You shall not slaughter it and its offspring both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28), and in these cases, no ritual slaughter was performed.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> The Rabbis in the mishna <b>taught</b> that one is liable when one of the animals is slaughtered for the sake of idol worship <b>only when he slaughtered</b> the <b>first</b> animal <b>for</b> the sake of <b>idol worship and</b> the <b>second</b> animal <b>for his</b> own <b>table. But</b> if he slaughtered the <b>first</b> animal <b>for his</b> own <b>table and</b> the <b>second</b> animal <b>for</b> the sake of <b>idol worship,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from lashes for the second act of slaughter, <b>as he receives</b> only <b>the greater</b> punishment, that for idol worship, which is death.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him: Even schoolchildren know this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that one who is liable to receive two punishments receives only the greater punishment. <b>Rather, sometimes, even if he slaughtered</b> the <b>first for his</b> own <b>table and</b> the <b>second for</b> the sake of <b>idol worship,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes for the second act of slaughter.
This occurs, <b>for example, where</b> the witnesses <b>forewarned him</b> before the second act of slaughter <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of: <b>Itself and its offspring, but</b> they <b>did not forewarn him with regard to idol worship.</b> Since he is not punished for performing idol worship, he receives lashes for the less severe transgression. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Since, had they forewarned him</b> with regard to idol worship he would have been <b>exempt</b> from lashes; therefore, even <b>if they did not forewarn him</b> with regard to idol worship, <b>he is also exempt</b> from lashes.
The Gemara notes: <b>And they</b> each <b>follow their</b> known lines of <b>reasoning</b> in this matter. <b>As when Rav Dimi came</b> to Babylonia from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said:</b> With regard to <b>those</b> who <b>unwittingly</b> performed a transgression for which one is <b>liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty if one performed it intentionally, <b>or those</b> who <b>unwittingly</b> performed a transgression for which one is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>lashes, and</b> that transgression also involved <b>another matter,</b> monetary payment, and they were forewarned with regard to the monetary penalty but not with regard to the lashes or the death penalty, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to pay; <b>and Reish Lakish says:</b> He is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the rationales for their statements. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that he is <b>liable; since they did not forewarn him</b> with regard to the severe transgression, he sinned unwittingly, and he remains liable only to pay the monetary payment. <b>And Reish Lakish says</b> that he is <b>exempt; since had they forewarned him</b> with regard to the severe transgression, he would have been <b>exempt</b> from the monetary payment, <b>when they did not forewarn him,</b> he is <b>also exempt.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And it is necessary</b> to state their disagreement with regard to both of these cases. <b>As, if it were taught to us</b> only <b>about this</b> case where one slaughters the mother for his private use and afterward slaughters its offspring for idol worship, perhaps only <b>in this</b> case involving the death penalty and lashes <b>does Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish say</b> that even if they did not forewarn the transgressor with regard to idol worship, he is still exempt from lashes for the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, because the death penalty and lashes are similar in that they are both corporal punishments, and so the obligation of lashes does not take effect at all when the death penalty is potentially applicable. <b>But in that</b> case, involving the death penalty or lashes together with a monetary payment, <b>say that he agrees with Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that the transgressor is liable to pay the monetary payment.
<b>And if</b> the disagreement <b>was stated</b> only <b>with regard to that</b> case, where one unwittingly performed a transgression involving the death penalty or lashes together with a transgression bearing a monetary payment, perhaps only <b>in that</b> case <b>does Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that he is liable to pay the monetary payment. <b>But in this</b> case, where one slaughtered an animal and its offspring, and the second animal was slaughtered for the sake of idol worship, which involves the death penalty and lashes, but without a forewarning with regard to the death penalty, <b>say that he agrees with Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> that one is exempt from lashes. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to state their disagreement with regard to both cases.
§ The mishna teaches that Rabbi Shimon deems one who slaughters the red heifer of purification exempt from punishment for the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, as that act of slaughter does not render the animal fit for consumption. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is the slaughter of <b>the</b> red <b>heifer of purification</b> considered an act of <b>slaughter that is unfit</b> for consumption? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> A red <b>heifer,</b> even if it has been slaughtered and it is therefore prohibited to derive benefit from it, <b>is susceptible to the ritual impurity of food, since it had a time in which it was fit</b> for consumption?

Daf 82a

<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says</b> in explanation of Rabbi Shimon’s statement: <b>Rabbi Shimon would say</b> that the red <b>heifer can be redeemed</b> with money even once it has been slaughtered and placed <b>upon its pyre</b> in preparation for being burned. Therefore, Rabbi Shimon states that there could be a time when the heifer was fit for consumption, i.e., if it was redeemed. Why, then, does he deem one who slaughters it exempt from liability for transgressing the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring? <b>Rav Shemen bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The statement with regard to <b>the</b> red <b>heifer of purification is not</b> considered part of the <b>mishna,</b> and Rabbi Shimon agrees that its slaughterer is liable for transgressing the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> the slaughter of the <b>heifer whose neck</b> was <b>to</b> have been <b>broken not</b> considered an act of <b>slaughter</b> that is <b>fit? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Sota</i> 47a): If a heifer was set aside to have its neck broken to atone for the murder of an individual whose murderer was not known, and then <b>the murderer was found before the heifer’s neck was broken,</b> the heifer <b>shall go out and graze among the flock,</b> as it is not consecrated. Evidently, before its neck is broken, deriving benefit from it is not prohibited, and its slaughter would be one that is fit. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> The statement with regard to <b>the heifer whose neck</b> was <b>to</b> have been <b>broken is not</b> considered part of the <b>mishna,</b> and Rabbi Shimon agrees that its slaughterer is liable for violating the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yannai</b> actually <b>say so? But doesn’t Rabbi Yannai say: I heard</b> the <b>boundary,</b> i.e., stage, beyond which the heifer is forbidden, <b>but I have forgotten</b> what it is; <b>but the group</b> of scholars <b>were inclined to say</b> that the heifer’s <b>descent to a hard valley,</b> where its neck is broken, <b>is</b> the action that <b>renders it forbidden?</b>
<b>And if it is so, let him resolve</b> the contradiction by saying: <b>Here,</b> where deriving benefit from the heifer is permitted, and its slaughterer is liable for transgressing the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, it is referring to an act of slaughtering that is fit and is performed <b>before</b> the heifer’s <b>descent,</b> while <b>there,</b> in the mishna, where Rabbi Shimon holds that there is no liability for transgressing: Itself and its offspring, it is referring to slaughtering performed <b>after</b> its <b>descent.</b> At that time, deriving benefit from the heifer is already prohibited, and the slaughter is therefore not considered fit.
<b>Rav Pineḥas, son of Rav Ami, said: We taught</b> the statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> himself, not as a quote from Rabbi Yannai: The statement with regard to <b>the heifer whose neck is broken is not</b> considered part of the <b>mishna. Rav Ashi said: When we were</b> studying in <b>the study hall of Rav Pappi,</b> that statement was <b>difficult for us: Did Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> actually <b>say</b> that it is not considered part of the mishna?
<b>But it was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> engaged in a dispute concerning the following issue: <b>From when</b> is one <b>prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from <b>the leper’s birds? Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> One is prohibited <b>from the moment of</b> their <b>slaughter; and Reish Lakish says:</b> One is prohibited <b>from the moment</b> they are <b>taken</b> and designated to be a leper’s birds. <b>And we say: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish?</b>
His reasoning is that he <b>derives</b> it via verbal analogy <b>from</b> the terms: <b>“Taking [<i>kiḥa</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 14:4), with regard to the birds, and: <b>“Taking [<i>kiḥa</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:3), with regard to the <b>heifer whose neck is broken.</b> Consequently, just as deriving benefit from the heifer whose neck is broken is prohibited from the time of its selection, so too must deriving benefit from these birds be prohibited from the time of their selection. Clearly, then, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish holds that deriving benefit from the heifer whose neck is broken is prohibited while it is still alive. Therefore, its slaughter is one that does not render the animal fit for consumption. Accordingly, Rabbi Shimon would exempt its slaughterer from the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, as is taught in the mishna.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The statement with regard to the <b>heifer whose neck is broken is not</b> considered part of <b>the mishna,</b> and this resolution of the difficulty was articulated by Rabbi Yoḥanan rather than Reish Lakish.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>two</b> people <b>who purchased a cow and its offspring,</b> where each purchased one of the animals, <b>whoever purchased</b> his animal <b>first shall slaughter</b> it <b>first,</b> and the second one must wait until the next day to slaughter his animal, so as not to violate the prohibition of: It and its offspring. <b>But if the second</b> one <b>preceded</b> him and slaughtered his animal first, he <b>benefitted,</b> and the one who purchased the animal first may not slaughter it until the next day.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yosef said: We learn</b> in the mishna that the first purchaser is granted precedence only <b>with regard to the matter of</b> a court <b>judgment,</b> in case the two purchasers go to court each demanding to slaughter his animal first. But there is no prohibition against the second one slaughtering his animal first if no claim is brought to court. Likewise, a Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If the second</b> one <b>preceded</b> him and slaughtered his animal first, <b>he is diligent and rewarded;</b> he is <b>diligent because he did not violate a prohibition, and</b> he is <b>rewarded because he eats meat</b> already that day.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one slaughtered a cow and thereafter</b> slaughtered <b>its two offspring</b> on the same day, <b>he incurs eighty</b> lashes for two separate actions violating the prohibition against slaughtering the mother and the offspring on the same day. If <b>one slaughtered its two offspring and thereafter slaughtered</b> the mother cow, <b>he incurs the forty</b> lashes, as he performed a single prohibited act. If <b>one slaughtered</b> the mother <b>and its daughter, and,</b> later that day, slaughtered <b>its daughter’s daughter, he incurs eighty</b> lashes, as he has performed the act of slaughtering a mother and its offspring twice.
But if <b>one slaughtered</b> the mother <b>and its daughter’s daughter and thereafter slaughtered its daughter, he incurs the forty</b> lashes, as he performed a single prohibited act. <b>Sumakhos says in the name of Rabbi Meir: He incurs eighty</b> lashes for slaughtering the daughter on the same day as its calf and its mother, as that act comprises two separate violations of the prohibition.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the statement in the mishna that if one slaughters two calves and thereafter slaughters their mother he incurs the forty lashes, the Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does he receive lashes? After all, the phrase: <b>“It and its offspring”</b> (Leviticus 22:28), is what <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah, <b>and not: Its offspring and it.</b> The Gemara answers: That thought should <b>not enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the phrase <b>“it and its offspring” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the prohibition includes slaughtering the animal <b>itself</b> first <b>and its offspring</b> afterward. <b>From where</b> do I derive that the prohibition also includes the case of slaughtering the offspring <b>itself</b> first <b>and its mother</b> afterward?
It is derived in the following manner: <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “You shall not slaughter [<i>tishḥatu</i>]</b> both in one day” (Leviticus 22:28), <b>this</b> is referring to <b>two</b> people who are prohibited from slaughtering on the same day, as the word “slaughter” is phrased in the plural. <b>How so?</b> If, during the course of a single day, there is <b>one</b> person <b>who slaughters the cow and</b> then <b>another who slaughters</b> that cow’s <b>mother, and</b> then there is <b>another</b> person <b>who slaughters</b> that cow’s <b>offspring, the two latter</b> people <b>are liable,</b> the first of them for slaughtering the mother after its offspring was slaughtered, and the second person for slaughtering the offspring after its mother was slaughtered.

Daf 82b

The Gemara challenges: <b>That</b> verse <b>is necessary for</b> the prohibition <b>itself,</b> and it cannot be used to teach this additional <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara explains: <b>If so,</b> that the verse teaches only the prohibition against slaughtering an animal and its offspring in one day, <b>let</b> the Torah <b>write: You shall not slaughter [<i>tishḥot</i>],</b> in the singular. For <b>what</b> reason did the Torah write: <b>“You shall not slaughter [<i>tishḥatu</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 22:28), in the plural? It is to teach that two different people are prohibited from slaughtering, as explained earlier.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But, nevertheless,</b> the plural <b>is necessary, as had the Merciful One written</b> in the Torah: <b>You shall not slaughter [<i>tishḥot</i>]</b> in the singular, <b>I would say:</b> With regard to <b>one</b> person, <b>yes,</b> it is prohibited to slaughter an animal and its offspring in a single day, but with regard to <b>two,</b> it is <b>not</b> prohibited for one of them to slaughter the mother and the other to then slaughter the offspring on the same day.
Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah: <b>“You shall not slaughter [<i>tishḥatu</i>],”</b> in the plural, indicating that <b>even two</b> individuals may not slaughter an animal and its offspring in a single day. The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that only this is derived from the verse, <b>let</b> the Torah <b>write: They shall not be slaughtered,</b> indicating that whether by one individual or two, the slaughter of an animal and its offspring in a single day is prohibited, but only the one who slaughters the offspring has violated the prohibition.
<b>What</b> is meant by: <b>“You shall not slaughter,”</b> which indicates that two different people are prohibited from slaughtering? <b>Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it:</b> Conclude that the prohibition applies even if two people perform the two acts of slaughter, and that two cases are prohibited: Slaughtering the offspring after the mother, and slaughtering the mother after the offspring.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>one slaughtered</b> the mother <b>and its daughter’s daughter</b> and thereafter slaughtered its daughter, he incurs the forty lashes. Sumakhos says in the name of Rabbi Meir: He incurs eighty lashes, because by slaughtering the daughter, he transgresses twice the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring. <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: What is the reasoning</b> for the opinion <b>of Sumakhos</b> that the transgressor incurs eighty lashes?
<b>Does Sumakhos hold,</b> in general, that if <b>one</b> unwittingly <b>ate two olive-bulks of</b> forbidden <b>fat during one lapse of awareness</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two sin offerings,</b> since he transgressed the prohibition twice? If so, then in a case where one is forewarned that if he transgresses intentionally he will receive lashes and he then violates the same prohibition twice, as is the case in the mishna, he receives two sets of lashes.
<b>And by right</b> the mishna <b>should have informed us</b> of Sumakhos’s opinion <b>in a general</b> case, such as that of eating two olive-bulks of forbidden fat during a single lapse of awareness, <b>but</b> the reason <b>that it teaches us</b> this dispute <b>in this</b> situation, where one slaughters an animal and its daughter’s offspring and, later that day, slaughters its daughter, is <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, that even though</b> the two animals that caused the daughter to be forbidden are <b>separate entities, the Rabbis</b> still <b>exempt</b> the transgressor from a second set of lashes.
<b>Or perhaps, Sumakhos holds</b> in general that if <b>one ate two olive-bulks of</b> forbidden <b>fat during one lapse of awareness,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering. If so, one who transgresses intentionally after being forewarned receives only one set of lashes even if he transgresses the same prohibition twice. <b>But here,</b> in the mishna, <b>this is the reason</b> that the transgressor receives two sets of lashes: It is <b>that</b> the two animals that caused the daughter to be prohibited are <b>separate entities.</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Yes,</b> Sumakhos <b>holds</b> in general that if <b>one ate two olive-bulks of</b> forbidden <b>fat during one lapse of awareness</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two sin offerings.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> does Rav Yosef derive this? He derives it <b>from that which we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who sows diverse kinds, diverse kinds,</b> i.e., he twice sows grain together with grape seeds, is <b>flogged</b> for violating the prohibition of diverse kinds. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by: Is <b>flogged? If we say</b> it means that he is <b>flogged one</b> set of lashes, this is <b>obvious. And additionally,</b> if he receives only one set of lashes, <b>what</b> is the reason that the case of: Sowing <b>diverse kinds</b> twice, is mentioned, where he transgressed twice? Even if he transgressed only once, he receives lashes. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that he receives <b>two</b> sets of <b>lashes.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What are we dealing with? If we say</b> that we are dealing with a case <b>where</b> one violates the prohibition twice, <b>one</b> time <b>after the other and with two</b> separate <b>forewarnings,</b> it is unnecessary for the <i>baraita</i> to teach this, as <b>we</b> already <b>learn</b> it in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 42a): <b>A nazirite who was drinking wine all day is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes. If onlookers <b>said to him: Do not drink, do not drink,</b> forewarning him several times, <b>and he drinks</b> after each forewarning, he is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for each and every</b> drink. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that he violated the prohibition twice <b>at the same time and with a single forewarning,</b> i.e., after he was forewarned he sowed wheat together with a grape seed with one hand, and barley together with a grape seed with the other hand, and he receives two sets of lashes.
The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis who disagree with Sumakhos</b> in the mishna, who hold that one who slaughters an animal and its daughter’s offspring and, later that day, slaughters its daughter receives only one set of lashes, that would not be reasonable: <b>Now, if there,</b> in the mishna, <b>where</b> there are animals that are <b>separate entities, the Rabbis exempt</b> him from a second set of lashes, since he violated a single prohibition with a single forewarning; <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to diverse kinds, where, unlike animals, seeds are not considered separate entities (see 83a), if one sows diverse kinds twice at the same time, should they <b>not all the more so</b> exempt him from a second set of lashes?
<b>Rather, is it not</b> that the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> with regard to diverse kinds <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Sumakhos</b> and teaches that, even with a single entity, one who violates the same prohibition twice receives two sets of lashes? The Gemara responds: <b>No, actually</b> the <i>baraita</i> with regard to diverse kinds is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and he was forewarned before each act of sowing, which is why he receives two sets of lashes. <b>And</b> although this statement is redundant, by repeating the phrase: Diverse kinds, <b>it teaches us a matter in passing: That there are two categories of</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds:</b> Sowing wheat together with grape seed and sowing barley together with grape seed.
<b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoshiya, as Rabbi Yoshiya says:</b> One who sows diverse kinds is not liable by Torah law <b>until he sows wheat, and barley, and</b> grape <b>seed with a single hand motion,</b> i.e., by sowing in the vineyard he violates the prohibition of diverse kinds that applies to seeds and to the vineyard simultaneously. Therefore, <b>it teaches us that when one sows</b> only <b>wheat and</b> grape <b>seed, or</b> only <b>barley and</b> grape <b>seed, he is liable as well.</b> Consequently, a source clarifying Sumakhos’s opinion in a case where one violates the same prohibition twice during a single lapse of awareness, or with only a single forewarning when one violated the prohibition intentionally, has not been found.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a mishna with regard to the prohibition against eating from the sciatic nerve (96a): If <b>one ate an olive-bulk from this</b> sciatic nerve in the right leg of an animal, <b>and an olive-bulk from that</b> sciatic nerve in the left leg of the same animal, he <b>incurs eighty</b> lashes. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He <b>incurs only forty</b> lashes. The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that he ate them <b>one after the other and with two</b> separate <b>forewarnings, what is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>it is an uncertain forewarning,</b> as Rabbi Yehuda is uncertain whether the prohibition against eating from the sciatic nerve applies to the sciatic nerve of the right thigh or that of the left thigh (see 90b). <b>And we have heard that Rabbi Yehuda says: An uncertain forewarning is not considered a forewarning.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one is uncertain which of two men is his father, and he <b>struck this</b> man <b>and then struck that</b> man, or <b>cursed this</b> man <b>and then cursed that</b> man, <b>or struck both of them simultaneously,</b> or <b>cursed both of them simultaneously,</b> in all these cases he is <b>liable</b> for violating the prohibition of: “And he that strikes his father, or his mother, shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:15), or that of: “And he that curses his father, or his mother, shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:17), as one of them is certainly his father.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Although if he struck or cursed both of them <b>simultaneously</b> he is <b>liable,</b> if he struck or cursed them <b>one after the other,</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> as each time he strikes or curses one of them he receives an uncertain forewarning, as perhaps this man is not his father, and one is liable only after receiving a definite forewarning. Consequently, if one was forewarned before eating from the sciatic nerve from the right leg, and afterward he was forewarned before eating from the sciatic nerve from the left leg, he would similarly be exempt as each of the forewarnings was uncertain. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the case in the mishna is one where he partook of the two sciatic nerves <b>simultaneously and with a single forewarning,</b> and therefore, he incurs only forty lashes according to Rabbi Yehuda.
<b>And who is the first <i>tanna</i></b> who holds that in such a case one receives eighty lashes? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>the Rabbis who disagree with Sumakhos</b> in the mishna about the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, that would conflict with their opinion: <b>Now, if there,</b> in the case of the mishna that discusses various animals <b>that</b> are <b>separate entities, the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> from a second set of lashes, <b>here,</b> in the mishna that discusses the sciatic nerve, where there are no separate animals, should they <b>not all the more so</b> exempt him from a second set of lashes? <b>Rather, is</b> the mishna <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Sumakhos?</b> Consequently, in his opinion one who eats the same prohibited item, such as an olive-bulk of forbidden fat, twice after a single forewarning receives two sets of lashes.
The Gemara responds: <b>No, actually</b> the case is one where he ate from the two sciatic nerves <b>one after the other</b> and received separate forewarnings, <b>and</b> the first opinion in that mishna is that of <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Sumakhos with regard to: Itself and its offspring. <b>And</b> as for the difficulty that Rabbi Yehuda does not render one liable if the forewarning is an uncertain one, <b>this <i>tanna</i> holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>another <i>tanna</i></b> with regard to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>As</b> that other <i>tanna</i> <b>says</b> that Rabbi Yehuda holds: <b>An uncertain forewarning is considered a forewarning, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the Paschal offering: “And <b>you shall not leave any of it until morning; but that which remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire”</b> (Exodus 12:10).

Daf 83a

<b>The verse comes to provide a positive</b> mitzva to burn the leftovers, in the second part of the verse that states: “But that which remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire.” This positive mitzva is stated <b>after the prohibition</b> against leaving it over was stated in the first part of the verse, <b>to say that one is not flogged for</b> transgressing the prohibition. This is because any prohibition that can be rectified by the performance of a positive mitzva does not carry a punishment of lashes. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> If not for this reason, Rabbi Yehuda evidently would hold that he receives lashes. The forewarning given in this case is uncertain, as he must be forewarned before morning, and at that time he might still consume it.
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov says: This is not for</b> that <b>reason [<i>hashem</i>]. Rather,</b> it is <b>because it is a prohibition that does not involve an action.</b> The transgression is simply the failure to consume all the meat during the allotted time rather than the performance of an action. <b>And one is not flogged for</b> the violation of <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution with regard to the opinion of Sumakhos from a <i>baraita</i> discussing the sciatic nerve: If <b>one ate two</b> sciatic <b>nerves from two thighs of two</b> different <b>animals,</b> he <b>incurs</b> the penalty of <b>eighty</b> lashes; <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He <b>incurs only forty</b> lashes. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in this case? <b>If we say</b> that he ate them <b>one after the other and with two</b> separate <b>forewarnings, what is the reasoning of</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, who says:</b> The violator receives <b>forty</b> lashes <b>and nothing more?</b> After all, he violates two separate prohibitions with two separate forewarnings. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that he ate them <b>at the same time and</b> with <b>a single forewarning.</b>
<b>Who is the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who holds that in such a case one receives eighty lashes? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>the Rabbis who disagree with Sumakhos</b> in the mishna about: Itself and its offspring, that would contradict their opinion: Now, <b>if there,</b> in that mishna in a case <b>where</b> there are various animals that are <b>separate entities, the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> from a second set of lashes, <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> about two sciatic nerves, which are not separate entities, should they <b>not all the more so</b> deem him exempt from a second set of lashes? <b>Rather, is it not Sumakhos</b> who is the first <i>tanna</i>? Consequently, in his opinion one who eats the same prohibited item, such as an olive-bulk of forbidden fat, twice after a single forewarning receives two sets of lashes.
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> he ate the two sciatic nerves <b>one after the other</b> with separate forewarnings, incurring two sets of lashes even according to the Rabbis who disagree with Sumakhos in the mishna about: Itself and its offspring. <b>And</b> as for <b>that which you say: What is the reason of Rabbi Yehuda</b> who holds that the transgressor incurs only a single set of lashes? This is a case <b>where</b> the volume of one of the sciatic nerves <b>is not</b> even <b>an olive-bulk,</b> and Rabbi Yehuda follows his line of reasoning, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one ate</b> the entire sciatic nerve, <b>and</b> its volume <b>is not</b> even <b>an olive-bulk,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to incur forty lashes; <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He is not liable <b>unless it has</b> a volume of at least <b>an olive-bulk.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>On four occasions during the year one who sells an animal to another is required to inform him: I sold the mother of</b> this animal today for the buyer <b>to slaughter</b> it,or: <b>I sold the daughter of</b> this animal today for the buyer <b>to slaughter</b> it. <b>And those</b> four occasions <b>are: The eve of the last day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>the eve of the first day of the festival of Passover, and the eve of <i>Shavuot</i>, and the eve of Rosh HaShana. And according to the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, the eve of Yom Kippur in the Galilee</b> is included <b>as well.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> must he inform the buyer on those days? He must do so <b>at a time when</b> the seller <b>has no interval</b> between the sale of the mother and the offspring, as they were both sold on that day. <b>But</b> if the seller <b>has an interval</b> between the sales, <b>he does not need to inform</b> the buyer, as presumably each buyer purchased the animal to slaughter it on the day he purchased it. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda concedes</b> that in a case <b>where one sells the mother</b> animal <b>to the groom and the offspring to the bride, that</b> even if he did not sell them on the same day, <b>he must inform</b> the buyer, as it is <b>obvious that they are both</b> planning to <b>slaughter</b> their animal <b>on one day,</b> for their wedding feast.
<b>On those four occasions, one compels the butcher to slaughter</b> animals even <b>against his will; even if</b> there is <b>a bull worth one thousand dinars and the buyer has only one dinar</b> worth of meat, i.e., he already paid the butcher for one dinar’s worth of meat, <b>one compels him to slaughter</b> the animal and give him a dinar’s worth of meat. <b>Therefore, if</b> the bull <b>dies</b> before slaughter, although no act of acquisition was performed, <b>it dies at</b> the expense <b>of the buyer,</b> and he loses his dinar. <b>But during the rest of the days of the year it is not so.</b> On other days, until the buyer performs the act of pulling to assume ownership of the portion of the bull that he is purchasing, the bull remains in the butcher’s possession. <b>Therefore, if</b> the bull <b>dies</b> before the transaction is complete, <b>it dies at</b> the expense of <b>the seller,</b> who returns the buyer’s money.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that on the four occasions mentioned it is the seller’s responsibility to inform the purchaser that the mother or offspring of the animal he is purchasing was sold that day. With regard to this it is <b>taught:</b> Consequently, the purchaser has no obligation to clarify the situation, and <b>if</b> the seller <b>did not inform him,</b> the purchaser <b>may go and slaughter</b> the animal he has purchased <b>and</b> need <b>not refrain</b> from doing so.
The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: When</b> must he inform the buyer on those days? It then teaches: And Rabbi Yehuda concedes that in a case where one sold the mother animal to the groom and the offspring to the bride, even if he did not sell them on the same day, he must inform the buyer. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>to teach</b> that the butcher sold specifically <b>the mother</b> animal <b>to the groom and the offspring to the bride?</b> It could have taught: He sold one to the groom and the other to the bride. The Gemara answers: <b>It teaches us a</b> related <b>matter in passing, that</b> it is <b>proper conduct for the groom’s household to exert more</b> effort <b>than the bride’s household</b> in the marriage preparations. Therefore, the groom purchases the mother, the larger animal, while the bride purchases the smaller animal, the offspring.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>On those four occasions,</b> one compels the butcher to slaughter animals even against his will, and even if there is a bull worth one thousand dinars and the buyer has paid for only one dinar’s worth of meat, one compels him to slaughter the animal. Therefore, if the bull dies before slaughter, it dies at the expense of the buyer. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the buyer <b>did not</b> yet <b>pull</b> the animal to effect acquisition; consequently, although he paid the seller, the animal is not his. <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The case is <b>where he pulled</b> it, and thereby acquired it. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the latter clause: But during the rest of the days of the year it is not so. Therefore, if</b> the bull <b>dies, it dies at</b> the expense of <b>the seller,</b> who returns the buyer’s money. <b>But</b> according to Rav, <b>didn’t</b> the buyer <b>pull</b> the animal? If so, why is its death at the expense of the seller?
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: Actually,</b> the case in the mishna is one <b>where</b> the buyer <b>did not pull</b> the animal, <b>and</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>transfers ownership to</b> the customer <b>by means of another</b> person, i.e., by instructing another to acquire a dinar’s worth of the ox’s meat on the customer’s behalf, without having obtained the customer’s consent. Therefore, <b>on those four occasions, where it is for</b> the customer’s <b>benefit,</b> as he wants meat for the Festival, the principle: <b>One can act in a person’s interest in his absence,</b> applies. By contrast, <b>during the rest of the days of the year, where it is to</b> the customer’s <b>disadvantage</b> to acquire the meat before the bull is slaughtered, as he does not want to incur avoidable expenses, <b>one cannot act to the disadvantage</b> of another <b>person in his absence.</b> Therefore, if the bull dies, it is at the expense of the seller.
<b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that there is a different explanation: <b>On those four occasions the Sages based their statement on</b> the <b>Torah law</b> that giving money effects acquisition, and therefore, the payment of the buyer acquires the meat for him with no need for pulling.
<b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says: By Torah law,</b> giving <b>money effects</b> the <b>acquisition</b> of movable property with no need for pulling. <b>And what is the reason</b> that the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>pulling effects acquisition?</b> It is a rabbinic <b>decree lest</b> the seller, once he receives the money, be unconcerned about the welfare of the movable property that he has sold, and, for example, not protect it from fire, so that he <b>will say to</b> the buyer: <b>Your wheat was burned in the upper story</b> of my house and I have no responsibility for it. For the benefit of rejoicing on the Festival, the Sages ordained that Torah law remains in effect on those four occasions and the buyer’s money effects acquisition, and one compels the butcher to slaughter animals even against his will.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the phrase <b>“one day” that is stated with regard to</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring, the day follows the night.</b> Therefore, one may slaughter an animal during the day and slaughter its offspring that night, but one may not slaughter an animal at night and slaughter its offspring the following day. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Zoma derived this</b> by means of a verbal analogy. <b>It is stated in the act of Creation: “One day”</b> (Genesis 1:5), <b>and it is stated with regard to</b> the slaughter of an animal <b>itself and its offspring: “One day”</b> (Leviticus 22:28). <b>Just as</b> concerning the phrase <b>“one day” that is stated in the act of Creation, the day follows the night, so too</b> concerning the phrase <b>“one day” that is stated with regard to</b> the slaughter of an animal <b>itself and its offspring, the day follows the night.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Zoma taught this</b> explanation: <b>Because the entire section</b> of the Torah where the prohibition: Itself and its offspring, appears <b>speaks only about sacrificial</b> animals, <b>and with regard to sacrificial</b> animals the <b>night follows the day,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> with regard to <b>this</b> prohibition it <b>is so.</b> Therefore, the following derivation is required: <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to the slaughter of an animal and its offspring: <b>“One day,” and it is stated in the act of Creation: “One day.” Just as</b> concerning the phrase <b>“one day” that is stated in the act of Creation, the day follows the night, so too</b> concerning the phrase <b>“one day” that is stated with regard to</b> the slaughter of an animal <b>itself and its offspring, the day follows the night.</b>

Daf 83b

§ <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse: “You shall not slaughter it and its offspring both in <b>one day”</b> (Leviticus 22:28), is referring to a special day, and it indicates that <b>a special day requires a proclamation</b> to prevent buyers from slaughtering an animal together with its offspring on that day. <b>From here</b> is derived that which is <b>stated</b> in the mishna: <b>On four occasions during the year,</b> which are special days, <b>one who sells an animal to another must inform him:</b> I sold its mother for slaughter, or: I sold its offspring for slaughter.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mitzva of <b>covering the blood</b> after slaughter <b>is in effect</b> both <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, both <b>in the presence,</b> i.e., the time, <b>of the Temple and not in the presence of the Temple.</b> And it is in effect <b>with regard to non-sacred</b> animals, <b>but</b> it is not in effect <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> ones. <b>And it is in effect with regard to</b> the slaughter of <b>an undomesticated animal and a bird, with regard to</b> animals and birds that are readily <b>available</b> in his home, <b>and with regard to</b> those <b>that are not</b> readily <b>available</b> and are hunted in the wild. <b>And it is in effect with regard to a <i>koy</i>, because it is uncertain</b> whether a <i>koy</i> is a domesticated animal and one is exempt from the covering of its blood or whether it is an undomesticated animal and one is obligated to cover it.
<b>And one may not slaughter</b> a <i>koy</i> <b>on a Festival,</b> because covering its blood entails the performance of prohibited labor that is permitted only if there is a definite obligation to cover the blood. <b>And if one slaughtered</b> a <i>koy</i> on a Festival after the fact, <b>one does not cover its blood</b> until after the Festival.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> one is <b>not</b> obligated to cover the blood of <b>sacrificial</b> birds? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because of</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Zeira,</b> that is difficult. <b>As Rabbi Zeira says: One who slaughters</b> a bird or an undomesticated animal <b>must place earth beneath</b> the blood <b>and earth above</b> it, <b>as it is stated: “And he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). It <b>is not stated:</b> Cover it with <b>earth,</b> but <b>rather, “in earth,”</b> indicating that the blood must be concealed inside the earth. The verse <b>teaches that one who slaughters</b> a bird or undomesticated animal <b>must place earth beneath</b> the blood <b>and earth above</b> the blood.
The Gemara continues: <b>And here,</b> with regard to a bird offering, whose blood is presented on the altar, it is <b>not possible</b> for one to cover the blood with earth from beneath it. As <b>how should one perform</b> the covering of the blood? If one suggests that <b>he should place</b> earth on the altar <b>and nullify</b> that earth to the altar such that it will never be removed from there, this is unfeasible, since by nullifying the earth to the altar, <b>he is adding to the structure</b> of the altar. <b>And it is written</b> with regard to the construction of the Temple: <b>“All was in writing, from the hand of the Lord, which He gave me to understand”</b> (I Chronicles 28:19), indicating that the dimensions of the Temple and all the vessels within were given prophetically and are therefore not subject to change.
And if one suggests that <b>he should not nullify</b> the earth to the altar, this too is problematic, as the earth <b>constitutes an interposition</b> between the blood of the bird and the altar.
The Gemara explains why this statement of Rabbi Zeira does not sufficiently explain why one is not required to cover the blood of sacrificial birds. <b>Granted that</b> it is <b>impossible</b> to place earth <b>beneath</b> the blood of the bird, but it is <b>possible</b> to place earth <b>above</b> the blood of the bird. If so, <b>let</b> him <b>perform a covering</b> of the blood from above.
The Gemara explains this suggestion: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosef says:</b> If <b>one slaughtered an undomesticated animal,</b> whose blood requires covering, <b>and thereafter slaughtered a domesticated animal,</b> whose blood does not require covering, in the same location as the undomesticated animal, he is <b>exempt from</b> the obligation <b>to cover</b> the blood of the undomesticated animal, as it is covered with the blood of the domesticated animal. But if one slaughtered <b>a domesticated animal and thereafter</b> slaughtered <b>an undomesticated animal</b> he is <b>obligated to cover</b> the latter’s blood despite the fact that there is no earth, but rather blood of the domesticated animal, beneath it. It is evident from this <i>baraita</i> that the mitzva of covering the blood applies even when earth cannot be placed beneath the blood.
The Gemara responds: The exclusion of sacrificial birds from the mitzva of covering the blood, even from above, is <b>in accordance with</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Zeira, as Rabbi Zeira says</b> with regard to meal offerings: For <b>any</b> measure of flour <b>that</b> is <b>suitable for mixing</b> with oil in a meal offering, the lack of <b>mixing does not invalidate</b> the meal offering. Even though there is a mitzva to mix the oil with the flour <i>ab initio</i>, the meal offering is fit for sacrifice even if the oil and the flour are not mixed together. <b>And</b> for <b>any</b> measure of flour <b>that</b> is <b>not suitable for mixing</b> with oil in a meal offering, the lack of <b>mixing invalidates</b> the meal offering. Similarly, if one slaughtered a domesticated animal and thereafter an undomesticated animal, since it was possible to cover the blood of the former before slaughtering the latter, which would allow the proper fulfillment of the mitzva of covering the blood, one is still obligated to cover the blood from above. By contrast, it is always impossible to properly perform the mitzva in the case of sacrificial birds.
The Gemara asks: Still, why is the mitzva of covering the blood not applicable to sacrificial birds? <b>Let one scrape</b> the blood off the altar <b>and cover it</b> elsewhere. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (87b): With regard to <b>blood that spurts</b> outside the pit in which the animal was slaughtered, <b>and</b> blood <b>that</b> remained <b>on the</b> slaughtering <b>knife,</b> one is <b>obligated to cover</b> it? <b>Evidently,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> one may <b>scrape</b> off the blood <b>and cover it</b> in a location other than where it spilled out. <b>Here too, let us scrape</b> the blood of a sacrificial bird off the altar <b>and cover it</b> elsewhere.
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the ruling of the mishna was dealing <b>with</b> items <b>consecrated for the altar, indeed,</b> the blood must be scraped off and covered elsewhere. But <b>here we are dealing with</b> items <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance,</b> i.e., birds donated to the Temple in order to be sold, the profits of which would be used for repairs. Such birds may not be slaughtered, and if one transgressed and slaughtered them it is prohibited to derive any benefit from them. The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna holds that the mitzva of covering the blood does not apply to a slaughtered animal that is forbidden for consumption.

Daf 84a

The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> even if the mishna is dealing with birds consecrated for Temple maintenance, <b>let one redeem them</b> after they were slaughtered <b>and</b> then <b>cover their</b> blood. The Gemara responds: This is not feasible, because in order to redeem a consecrated animal <b>we require setting and valuating,</b> i.e., the animal must be stood before a priest in order to evaluate it and only then is it redeemed (see Leviticus 27:11–12). A slaughtered bird cannot be stood before the priest; consequently, it cannot be redeemed.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the mishna is dealing with birds consecrated for Temple maintenance, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion is the mishna? <b>If</b> one suggests the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: Everything,</b> i.e., animals consecrated both for the altar and for Temple maintenance, <b>was included in</b> the requirement of <b>setting and valuating,</b> and therefore the slaughtered birds may not be redeemed, this cannot be so. <b>Doesn’t he</b> also <b>say</b> that <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>considered</b> a halakhic act of <b>slaughter</b> that requires the covering of the blood? If so, one should be obligated to cover the blood of the bird even if it is not redeemed.
The Gemara continues: And <b>if</b> one suggests the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says: Slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted <b>is not considered</b> a halakhic act of <b>slaughter</b> and therefore the bird would require redemption in order to cover its blood, this cannot be so. <b>Doesn’t</b> he also <b>say</b> that animals consecrated for Temple maintenance <b>were not included in</b> the requirement of <b>setting and valuating?</b> If so, let one redeem the slaughtered birds and cover their blood.
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> in reconciliation of this dilemma: The mishna’s ruling <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and he formulates</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinions of different <b><i>tanna’im</i>: With regard to</b> the status of an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> while <b>with regard to</b> the requirement of <b>setting and valuating he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> Therefore, since one cannot redeem a bird that was consecrated for Temple maintenance once it has been slaughtered, there is no obligation to cover its blood, as the slaughter was not fit to render the meat permitted.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>the entire</b> mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that birds consecrated for Temple maintenance may be redeemed even after their slaughter. <b>And</b> although it would seem that their slaughter is fit to render the meat permitted and that one should therefore be obligated in the mitzva of covering the blood, it is <b>different here, as the verse states: “And he shall pour out</b> its blood <b>and cover</b> it” (Leviticus 17:13). By juxtaposing “pour out” to “cover,” the verse indicates that the obligation to cover the blood applies only to blood <b>that is lacking only pouring and covering,</b> without any intervening step. <b>Excluded</b> is <b>this</b> blood of birds consecrated for Temple maintenance, <b>which is lacking pouring, redeeming, and covering.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And now that you have arrived at this</b> explanation, <b>you</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna is referring to birds <b>consecrated for the altar.</b> As for the question asked earlier: Why not let one scrape the blood from the altar and then cover it? The verse states: “And he shall pour out its blood and cover it,” indicating that the obligation to cover the blood applies only to blood that is <b>lacking only pouring and covering,</b> without any intervening step. <b>Excluded</b> is <b>this</b> blood of bird offerings, <b>which is lacking pouring, scraping, and covering.</b>
The Gemara cites another source for the exclusion of consecrated animals from the requirement of covering their blood: <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the mitzva of covering the blood: <b>“An undomesticated animal or bird”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). The juxtaposition of these two species intimates an analogy between them: <b>Just as</b> the <b>undomesticated animal</b> referred to in the verse <b>is not consecrated,</b> as undomesticated animals are never fit for sacrifice, <b>so too,</b> the <b>bird</b> referred to in the verse <b>is not consecrated.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is so that the <i>halakhot</i> of slaughtering a bird are derived from those of an undomesticated animal, then say: <b>Just as</b> the verse is referring to <b>an undomesticated animal, whose species cannot be consecrated</b> as an offering, <b>so too,</b> the verse is referring only to <b>a bird whose species cannot be consecrated</b> as an offering. Therefore, <b>I will exclude</b> even non-sacred <b>doves and pigeons, whose species can be consecrated.</b>
The Gemara rejects this possibility: <b>No,</b> the juxtaposition indicates that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the slaughter of birds is entirely <b>like</b> that of <b>an undomesticated animal.</b> Therefore, <b>just as</b> in the case of <b>an undomesticated animal, you did not differentiate</b> between its various species and all non-sacred animals are included in the mitzva, <b>so too,</b> with regard to the <b>bird</b> mentioned in the verse, <b>you should not differentiate</b> between its various species.
§ Concerning the <i>halakha</i> that covering the blood does not apply to a domesticated animal, the Gemara says that <b>Ya’akov the heretic said to Rava: We maintain</b> that <b>an undomesticated animal,</b> e.g., a deer, is <b>included</b> in the category of <b>a domesticated animal with regard to</b> the <b>characteristics</b> necessary to determine whether the animal is kosher, i.e., it chews its cud and has split hooves (see Deuteronomy 14:4–6). If so, <b>I will also say</b> that <b>a domesticated animal is included</b> in the category of <b>an undomesticated animal with regard to</b> the mitzva of <b>covering</b> the blood.
Rava <b>said to him: With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states</b> in reference to the blood of a domesticated animal: “You may slaughter of your cattle and of your sheep…but be strong not to eat the blood…<b>you shall pour it out on the ground, like water”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21–24). Accordingly, <b>just as water does not require covering, so too, this</b> blood of a domesticated animal <b>does not require covering.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the verse equates the blood of a domesticated animal with water, then let one <b>immerse</b> ritually impure items <b>in it</b> to purify them, just as he can immerse them in water. The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states: “But a spring or a cistern, or a gathering of water shall be pure”</b> (Leviticus 11:36). The exclusionary term: “But,” indicates that only concerning <b>these</b> bodies of water, <b>yes,</b> they render pure an impure item, while <b>something else,</b> e.g., blood, does <b>not.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> perhaps one can <b>say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> i.e., the exclusionary term in the verse, serves only <b>to exclude other liquids that are not called water. But</b> with regard to <b>blood, which is called water,</b> as the verse states: “You shall pour it out on the ground, like water,” one may <b>indeed</b> immerse ritually impure items in it.
The Gemara responds: <b>Two exclusions are written</b> in the verse discussing ritually purifying waters: <b>A spring of water, and: A cistern of water.</b> The term “water” is understood as being attached to each of the bodies mentioned in the verse. The additional exclusion serves to exclude blood.
The Gemara challenges: <b>Say</b> that both <b>this</b> phrase, a spring of water, <b>and that</b> phrase, a cistern of water, serve <b>to exclude other liquids,</b> and not blood, whereby <b>one</b> phrase is <b>to exclude flowing</b> liquids that are not water from having the status of a spring, which renders an item ritually pure even when it is flowing; <b>and one</b> phrase serves <b>to exclude gathered</b> liquids that are not water from having the status of a ritual bath, which renders an item pure only when the water in the ritual bath is gathered.
The Gemara responds: <b>Three exclusions are written</b> in the verse: <b>A spring of water,</b> to exclude flowing liquids; <b>and: A cistern of water,</b> to exclude gathered liquids; <b>and: A gathering of water,</b> to exclude blood.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to covering the blood: “And any man of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, <b>who traps</b> a trapping of an undomesticated animal or bird that may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth” (Leviticus 17:13). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is obligated to cover the blood of an undomesticated animal or bird <b>that one traps. From where</b> is it derived that undomesticated animals or birds that are <b>already</b> considered <b>trapped on their own, such as geese and chickens</b> that do not roam freely, are also included in the mitzva of covering the blood?
<b>The verse states “a trapping”</b> to indicate that <b>in any case,</b> one is obligated to cover the blood of an undomesticated animal. <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Who traps,”</b> if it is not to be understood literally? The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>The Torah taught</b> that it is <b>a desired mode of behavior that a person should consume meat only with this mode of preparation.</b> That is, just as the meat that one traps is not readily available, so too, one should not become accustomed to consuming meat.
In a similar vein, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“When the Lord, your God, expands your</b> boundary…according to every craving of your soul you may eat meat” (Deuteronomy 12:20). <b>The Torah taught</b> that it is <b>a desired mode of behavior that a person should consume meat due only to appetite.</b> That is, one should consume meat only when he feels a need to eat it.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a person may purchase</b> meat <b>from the marketplace and consume</b> it. Therefore, <b>the</b> next <b>verse states: “And you may slaughter of your cattle and of your flock,”</b> indicating that one should consume the meat of animals of his own flock, not those purchased in the marketplace. One <b>might</b> have thought that a person <b>may slaughter all of his cattle,</b> i.e., his only cow, <b>and consume</b> the meat, or slaughter <b>all of his flock,</b> i.e., his only sheep, <b>and consume</b> the meat. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Of your cattle,”</b> indicating some, <b>but not all of, your cattle; “of your flock,” but not all of your flock.</b>
<b>From here, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria said: One who has one hundred</b> dinars <b>should purchase a <i>litra</i> of vegetables for his stewpot [<i>lefaso</i>];</b> one who has <b>one thousand</b> dinars <b>should purchase a <i>litra</i> of fish for his stewpot;</b> one who has <b>five thousand</b> dinars <b>should purchase a <i>litra</i> of meat for his stewpot;</b> and if one has <b>ten thousand</b> dinars, his servants <b>should place a pot</b> of meat on the stove <b>for him every day.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>these</b> other individuals mentioned by Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria, <b>when,</b> i.e., how often, should they consume meat? The Gemara responds: <b>Every Shabbat eve.</b>
<b>Rav says: We must be concerned for the statement of the elder,</b> i.e., Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria, and be thrifty with our expenditure on food items. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Abba,</b> i.e., Rav, <b>was from a family of</b> particularly <b>healthy</b> individuals, and was able to subsist on the modest diet suggested by Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria. <b>But</b> with regard to people <b>such as us,</b> who are not as healthy, <b>one who has</b> even <b>one <i>peruta</i> in his pocket should hasten</b> with <b>it to the storekeeper</b> and purchase food. Two generations later, <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> With regard to people <b>such as us,</b> who are physically weaker than those in previous generations, not only do we not delay the purchase of food items, we even <b>borrow</b> money to purchase food <b>and eat.</b>
The Gemara continues its discussion with regard to one’s livelihood: The verse states: “The lambs will be for your clothing, and goats the worth of a field. And there will be goats’ milk enough for your food, for the food of your household; and sustenance for your maidens” (Proverbs 27:26–27). <b>“The lambs will be for your clothing”</b> indicates that <b>your clothing should be</b> produced <b>from the shearings of lambs,</b> i.e., purchase lambs from whose wool you can produce clothing. <b>“And goats the worth of a field”</b> indicates that <b>a person should always</b> seek to <b>sell a field and purchase goats</b> in order to benefit from their milk, wool, and offspring, <b>and a person should not sell goats and purchase a field</b> instead. <b>“And there will be goats’ milk enough”</b> indicates that <b>it is sufficient for a person that he be sustained from the milk of kids and lambs that are in his house.</b>
<b>“For your food, for the food of your household”</b> indicates that <b>your food comes before the food of your household,</b> i.e., one must first ensure that he has food for himself before providing for others. With regard to the phrase: <b>“And sustenance for your maidens,” Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, said:</b> The verse indicates that you must <b>give sustenance to your youth,</b> i.e., to your children. <b>From here, the Torah taught</b> that it is <b>a desired mode of behavior that a person should not accustom his son</b> to eat <b>meat and</b> drink <b>wine;</b> rather, he should teach his children to eat less expensive foods.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b>

Daf 84b

<b>One who wishes to become wealthy</b> should <b>engage in</b> raising <b>small domesticated animals. Rav Ḥisda said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And the flocks [<i>ve’ashterot</i>] of your sheep”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:13)? It means <b>that</b> sheep <b>enrich [<i>me’ashrot</i>] their owners.</b>
The Gemara cites additional statements by Rabbi Yoḥanan providing practical advice. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is preferable to drink from <b>a cup of witches and not</b> to drink from <b>a cup of lukewarm</b> water, which is extremely unhealthy. Rabbi Yoḥanan qualifies his statement: <b>We said this only with regard to</b> lukewarm water <b>in metal vessels, but in earthenware vessels we have no</b> problem <b>with it. And even in metal vessels, we said</b> that lukewarm water is unhealthy <b>only</b> in a case where <b>one did not cast flavorings into</b> the water, <b>but if he cast flavorings into</b> the water <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it. And even if one cast flavorings into</b> the water, <b>we said this only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the water had <b>not</b> been <b>boiled [<i>tzeyatz</i>], but</b> if the water had been <b>boiled we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of <b>one whose father bequeathed him a great deal of money and he seeks to lose it,</b> he <b>should wear linen garments, and should use glass vessels, and should hire laborers and not sit with them</b> to supervise. The Gemara elaborates: <b>He should wear linen garments;</b> this is stated <b>with regard to Roman linen,</b> which becomes tattered quickly. <b>He should use glass vessels;</b> this is stated <b>with regard to</b> expensive <b>white glass. And he should hire laborers and not sit with them;</b> this applies to laborers who work <b>with oxen, whose</b> potential for causing <b>damage is great</b> if they are not supervised, as they will trample the crops.
<b>Rav Avira interpreted</b> the following verse homiletically, but <b>sometimes</b> he <b>said</b> the interpretation <b>in the name of Rabbi Ami and sometimes he said it in the name of Rabbi Asi: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Good is the man who is gracious and lends, who orders his affairs with justice”</b> (Psalms 112:5)? It means to teach that <b>a person should always eat and drink less than what is</b> within <b>his means, and he should dress and cover himself in accordance with his means, and he should honor his wife and children more than what is</b> within <b>his means; as they are dependent on him and he is dependent on the One Who spoke and the world was</b> created.
§ The mishna teaches that one may not slaughter a <i>koy</i> on a Festival since he may not cover its blood, as it is unclear whether there is an obligation by Torah law to do so. But if one transgressed and slaughtered a <i>koy</i>, one does not cover its blood. With regard to this, <b>Rav Eina taught at the entrance to the house of the Exilarch: One who slaughters</b> an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>for</b> a critically <b>ill</b> person <b>on Shabbat,</b> for whom it is permitted to slaughter, is <b>obligated to cover</b> its blood. <b>Rabba said to</b> those present: Rav Eina <b>is saying an astonishing</b> statement; <b>remove his interpreter from</b> before <b>him. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One may not slaughter a <i>koy</i> on a Festival, but if he slaughtered</b> it, <b>one does not cover its blood</b> until after the Festival.
Rabbi Yosei elaborates: This can be derived <b>from an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And if</b> with regard to the mitzva of <b>circumcision,</b> concerning <b>which a definite</b> obligation <b>overrides Shabbat,</b> nevertheless <b>its uncertain</b> obligation <b>does not override a Festival;</b> then with regard to the mitzva of <b>covering</b> the blood, concerning <b>which</b> even <b>a definite</b> obligation <b>does not override Shabbat,</b> is it <b>not logical that its uncertain</b> obligation, e.g., covering the blood of a <i>koy</i>, <b>would not override a Festival?</b> Although circumcision involves an act of prohibited labor, one performs it on Shabbat for a male infant whose eighth day from birth occurs on Shabbat. But in a case where it is uncertain when the eighth day from birth occurs, it is forbidden to circumcise the child on a Festival. By contrast, covering the blood is never performed on Shabbat.
The Sages <b>said to him</b> in rebuttal: <b>The sounding of the shofar in the provinces,</b> i.e., outside the Temple, <b>will prove</b> that this <i>a fortiori</i> inference is incorrect. This is <b>because its definite</b> obligation <b>does not override Shabbat</b> and it is prohibited to sound the shofar on Rosh HaShana that falls on Shabbat; <b>and</b> yet <b>its uncertain</b> obligation <b>overrides</b> the <b>Festival.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Distinguished responded</b> with another <b>refutation</b> of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference: It cannot be inferred from circumcision that an uncertain obligation of the mitzva of covering the blood does not override a Festival. <b>What</b> is notable <b>about circumcision?</b> It is notable in <b>that it is not in effect on Festival nights,</b> but is performed only during the daytime. Will <b>you</b> then <b>say with regard to</b> the mitzva of <b>covering</b> the blood, <b>which is in effect on Festival nights,</b> that it does not override a Festival? Perhaps, since the mitzva of covering the blood is in effect during both day and night, its uncertain obligation overrides a Festival as well.
In reference to Rabbi Elazar HaKappar’s refutation, <b>Rabbi Abba says: This</b> <i>a fortiori</i> inference drawn by Rabbi Yosei is <b>one of the matters</b> with regard to <b>which Rabbi Ḥiyya says: I do not have any refutation for them, and Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Distinguished</b> successfully <b>responded</b> with <b>a refutation.</b>
Rabba concludes his refutation of the statement of Rav Eina: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches that definite</b> obligations with regard to the mitzva of <b>covering</b> the blood <b>do not override Shabbat.</b> Now, <b>what</b> is a case of <b>a definite</b> obligation <b>of covering</b> the blood <b>that does not override Shabbat?</b> Is it <b>not</b> a case where <b>one slaughters</b> an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>for</b> a critically <b>ill</b> person <b>on Shabbat?</b> The <i>baraita</i> nevertheless teaches that one does not cover the blood, in contradiction to the ruling of Rav Eina.
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to an instance <b>where</b> one <b>transgressed</b> Shabbat <b>and slaughtered</b> an animal for a healthy person. But in a case where one slaughtered an animal for an ill person, since it was permitted for him to slaughter the animal, perhaps he must cover the blood as well.
The Gemara responds: The <i>baraita</i> cannot be referring to such a case, since Rabbi Yosei compares it with circumcision. Therefore, it must be <b>similar to</b> the case of <b>circumcision,</b> in that <b>just as</b> the <b>circumcision</b> was performed <b>with permission,</b> as it is a mitzva to perform circumcision even if the eighth day falls on Shabbat, <b>so too,</b> the <b>covering</b> of the blood must be referring to a case where the slaughter was done <b>with permission,</b> i.e., for an ill person. Accordingly, the <i>baraita</i> poses a difficulty to the statement of Rav Eina.
§ The <i>baraita</i> states that the Sages <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yosei in refutation of his <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>The sounding of the shofar in the provinces will prove</b> that the inference is incorrect, <b>since its definite</b> obligation <b>does not override Shabbat and its uncertain</b> obligation <b>overrides a Festival.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>its uncertain</b> obligation that overrides a Festival?
<b>If we say</b> that it is referring to <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to whether one of the two days of Rosh HaShana is <b>a weekday</b> or <b>a Festival,</b> this is unfeasible: <b>Now</b> that the sounding of the shofar <b>overrides</b> the <b>definite Festival</b> of Rosh HaShana, <b>is it necessary</b> to teach that it overrides a day with regard to which it is <b>uncertain</b> whether it is <b>a Festival</b> or <b>a weekday?</b> That is, if the uncertainty is with regard to the Festival itself, then this case should have no bearing on the <i>halakha</i> concerning the obligation to cover the blood of a <i>koy</i> on a Festival, since the latter occurs on a definite Festival.

Daf 85a

<b>Rather,</b> it must be that the <b>uncertainty</b> in the case of the sounding of the shofar concerns whether a particular individual is <b>a man</b> or <b>a woman,</b> e.g., a <i>tumtum</i>, whose sexual organs are indeterminate. Although a woman is not obligated in the mitzva of sounding the shofar, a <i>tumtum</i> is in fact obligated, despite the uncertainty of sex. It is therefore possible to derive from the sounding of the shofar that if one slaughters a <i>koy</i>, an animal whose status as a domesticated or undomesticated animal is uncertain, on a Festival, one covers its blood.
The Gemara notes: <b>And Rabbi Yosei,</b> who does not accept this refutation, conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says:</b> One who is <b>definitely a woman may also sound</b> the shofar on Rosh HaShana. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse that discusses a burnt offering: “Speak to the sons of Israel…and he shall place his hands upon the head of the burnt offering” (Leviticus 1:2–4). The verse indicates that <b>the sons of Israel place</b> their hands upon the head of an offering, <b>but the daughters of Israel do notplace</b> their hands.
<b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> It is <b>optional</b> for <b>women</b> to <b>place</b> their hands on the head of an offering before it is slaughtered. Even though women are not obligated to place their hands, doing so is not considered to be performing labor with a sacrificial item, an act normally prohibited, despite the fact that one performs the placing of the hands by leaning with all of his weight on the animal. Similarly, Rabbi Yosei holds that although women are not obligated in the sounding of the shofar, it is optional for them to sound it, and it is not considered a desecration of the Festival.
<b>Ravina said: And</b> even according <b>to what the Sages said,</b> that a woman may not sound the shofar on Rosh HaShana but a <i>tumtum</i> is nevertheless obligated due to uncertainty, <b>there is a refutation</b> to their claim <b>as well.</b> One cannot derive from this that the obligation to cover the blood of a <i>koy</i> overrides a Festival. <b>What</b> is notable <b>about the sounding of the shofar?</b> It is notable in <b>that its definite</b> obligation <b>overrides Shabbat in the Temple,</b> as it was sounded in the Temple even when Rosh HaShana occurred on Shabbat, and it is therefore understandable that its uncertain obligation overrides a Festival as well. <b>Can you say</b> the same <b>with regard to</b> the mitzva of <b>covering</b> the blood, <b>which does not</b> override Shabbat in <b>any</b> instance?
The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Distinguished responded</b> with another refutation to Rabbi Yosei’s <i>a fortiori</i> inference: One cannot infer from the mitzva of circumcision that an uncertain obligation to cover the blood of a <i>koy</i> does not override a Festival. <b>What</b> is notable <b>about circumcision?</b> It is notable in <b>that it is not in effect on Festival nights.</b> Can you say the same with regard to the mitzva of covering the blood, which is in effect on Festival nights? The Gemara asks: Does Rabbi Elazar HaKappar mean to say <b>that</b> the mitzva of circumcision <b>is not in effect</b> only <b>on Festival nights,</b> but <b>it is in effect on other,</b> non-Festival <b>nights?</b> Isn’t circumcision always performed during the day?
The Gemara responds: <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Elazar HaKappar meant the following: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about circumcision?</b> It is notable in <b>that it is not in effect at night as</b> it is <b>by day. Can you say</b> a similar <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the mitzva of <b>covering</b> the blood, <b>which is in effect at night as</b> it is <b>by day? Rabbi Abba said: This</b> <i>a fortiori</i> inference drawn by Rabbi Yosei is <b>one of the matters</b> with regard to <b>which Rabbi Ḥiyya says</b> that <b>there is no refutation for them, and Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Distinguished</b> successfully <b>responded</b> with <b>a refutation.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>and it is discovered to be an animal with a wound that would have caused it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>];</b> and in the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>for</b> the sake of <b>idol worship; and</b> in the case of <b>one who slaughters a non-sacred</b> animal or bird <b>inside</b> the Temple courtyard <b>or a sacrificial</b> bird <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard; or in the case of one who slaughters <b>an undomesticated animal or a bird that</b> was sentenced to <b>be stoned,</b> e.g., for killing a person; in all these cases, even though it is prohibited to eat any of these animals or birds, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> one <b>obligated</b> to cover their blood, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> one <b>exempt</b> from doing so because, in their opinion, slaughter that is not fit to render the meat permitted for consumption is not considered an act of slaughter.
<b>One who slaughters</b> an animal or bird <b>and it became a carcass by his hand,</b> i.e., the slaughter was performed incorrectly, and <b>one who stabs</b> the animal or bird, <b>and one who tears loose</b> the windpipe and the gullet, are <b>exempt from covering</b> the blood, as no act of slaughter took place, and one is obligated to cover blood only after a valid slaughter.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the dispute in the mishna about whether an act of slaughter that is not fit to render the meat permitted renders one obligated to cover the blood, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the redactor of the Mishna, <b>saw</b> as correct <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir,</b> that ineffective slaughter is considered an act of slaughter, <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition against slaughtering <b>a mother and its offspring</b> on the same day, <b>and taught</b> that <i>halakha</i> in the mishna (81b) <b>using the term: The Rabbis,</b> so that it would be accepted. <b>And</b> he saw as correct the statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon,</b> that ineffective slaughter is not considered an act of slaughter <b>with regard to</b> the mitzva of <b>covering the blood, and taught</b> that <i>halakha</i> in the mishna here <b>using the term: The Rabbis.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason that Rabbi Meir</b> holds that ineffective slaughter is considered an act of slaughter in the case of <b>a mother and its offspring? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> He <b>derives</b> his opinion by means of a verbal analogy of the terms <b>slaughter</b> and <b>slaughter, from</b> the case of sacrificial animals <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple. The verse states with regard to a mother and its offspring: “It and its offspring you shall not slaughter [<i>lo tishḥatu</i>] in one day” (Leviticus 22:28), and the verse states with regard to sacrificial animals: “Or that is slaughtered [<i>yishḥat</i>] outside the camp” (Leviticus 17:3).
Accordingly, <b>just as there,</b> with regard to one who slaughters an offering outside the Temple it is a case of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted, as one is prohibited from deriving any benefit from such meat, and it <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter</b> to render one liable for slaughtering it outside the Temple, <b>so too here,</b> in the case of a mother and its offspring, an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted <b>is considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter,</b> and one is liable.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Shimon, what is the reason</b> he holds that an ineffective slaughter is not considered an act of slaughter? <b>Rabbi Mani bar Pattish said:</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>derives</b> his opinion <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“Slaughter [<i>tevo’aḥ</i>] and prepare;</b> for the men shall dine with me at noon” (Genesis 43:16). <b>Just as there,</b> the verse is referring to an act of <b>slaughter</b> that is <b>fit</b> to render the meat permitted, <b>so too here,</b> in the case of a mother and its offspring, only an act of <b>slaughter</b> that is <b>fit</b> to render the meat permitted is considered an act of slaughter.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Meir as well, let him derive from “<i>tevo’aḥ</i>”</b> that only an effective slaughter is considered an act of slaughter. The Gemara responds: According to Rabbi Meir, <b>one derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a term of <b><i>sheḥita</i> from</b> another instance of a term of <b><i>sheḥita</i>, and one does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the term of <b><i>sheḥita</i> from</b> the term of <b><i>teviḥa</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: Being that both terms refer to slaughter, <b>what is the difference</b> which one is used; <b>didn’t the school of Rabbi Yishmael teach</b> a verbal analogy with regard to leprosy of houses: The verse states: <b>“And the priest shall return [<i>veshav</i>]</b> on the seventh day” (Leviticus 14:39), and another verse with regard to the priest’s visit seven days later states: <b>“And the priest shall come [<i>uva</i>]</b> and look” (Leviticus 14:44). <b>This returning</b> and <b>this coming</b> have the same meaning and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the <i>halakha</i> that applies if the leprosy had spread at the conclusion of the first week applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week.
The Gemara responds: <b>This statement</b> of the school of Rabbi Yishmael applies only <b>where there are no</b> other terms <b>that are identical to it</b> from which one could derive a verbal analogy. <b>But</b> if <b>there is</b> another term <b>that is identical to it, we derive</b> the verbal analogy <b>from</b> the term <b>that is identical to it.</b> Accordingly, Rabbi Meir derives a verbal analogy from the instance of <i>sheḥita</i> that appears with regard to sacrificial animals that are slaughtered outside the Temple.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Shimon as well, let him derive from</b> the case of sacrificial animals that were <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple that ineffective slaughter is considered an act of slaughter. The Gemara responds: Rabbi Shimon holds that <b>one derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the slaughter of <b>non-sacred</b> animals <b>from</b> another instance of the slaughter of <b>non-sacred</b> animals, <b>and one does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the slaughter of <b>non-sacred</b> animals <b>from</b> an instance of the slaughter of <b>sacrificial</b> animals. The prohibition against slaughtering a mother and its offspring on the same day is stated primarily with regard to non-sacred animals (see 78a).
The Gemara continues: <b>And Rabbi Meir</b> would respond: <b>Is this to say</b> that the prohibition against slaughtering <b>a mother and its offspring</b> on the same day <b>does not apply to sacrificial</b> animals? Rather, since the prohibition also applies to sacrificial animals, one can derive its <i>halakha</i> from the case of sacrificial animals that were slaughtered outside the Temple. The Gemara comments: <b>This is</b> what <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> was referring to when he <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>saw</b> as correct <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a mother and its offspring, and taught it</b> in the mishna <b>using the term: The Rabbis.</b>
§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the dispute in the mishna: <b>What is the reason that Rabbi Meir</b> holds one is obligated <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>covering the blood</b> in a case of ineffective slaughter? <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> Rabbi Meir <b>derives</b> this from a verbal analogy between the terms <b>pouring</b> and <b>pouring, from</b> the case of a sacrificial animal that was <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Temple courtyard. One verse states with regard to covering the blood: “And he shall pour out its blood” (Leviticus 17:13), and one verse states with regard to sacrificial animals slaughtered outside the Temple courtyard: “He has poured blood” (Leviticus 17:4). Accordingly, <b>just as there,</b> with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Temple courtyard, it is a case of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted but <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter, so too here,</b> with regard to covering the blood, an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted <b>is considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> would respond: It is <b>written</b> with regard to covering the blood: “An undomesticated animal or bird <b>that may be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 17:13), indicating that the verse is referring specifically to slaughter fit to render the meat permitted for consumption. <b>And Rabbi Meir</b> holds: <b>That</b> phrase <b>comes to exclude a ritually impure bird</b> from the mitzva of covering the blood. <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> would respond: <b>What is the reason an impure bird</b> is not included in the mitzva of covering the blood? It is <b>because it is not fit for consumption.</b> If so, <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> should <b>also</b> not be included in the mitzva of covering the blood, since <b>it is</b> also <b>not fit for consumption.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And this is what Rabbi Ḥiyya is saying</b> when he said that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>saw</b> as correct <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>covering the blood, and taught it</b> in the mishna <b>using the term: The Rabbis.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Abba says:</b>

Daf 85b

<b>Not with regard to all</b> <i>halakhot</i> did <b>Rabbi Meir say</b> an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit,</b> e.g., where one slaughters a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>is considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter,</b> as <b>Rabbi Meir</b> does <b>concede that</b> such an act of slaughter <b>does not render</b> the meat of the animal <b>permitted for consumption. And not with regard to all</b> <i>halakhot</i> did <b>Rabbi Shimon say</b> an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit is not considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter,</b> as <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> does <b>concede that</b> such an act of slaughter <b>renders</b> the animal <b>pure from</b> having the impure status of an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass.</b>
The Gemara analyzes this statement: <b>The Master said</b> that <b>not with regard to all</b> <i>halakhot</i> did <b>Rabbi Meir say</b> an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit is considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter,</b> as <b>Rabbi Meir concedes that</b> such an act of slaughter <b>does not render</b> the meat of the animal <b>permitted for consumption.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious? Can a <i>tereifa</i> become permitted</b> for consumption <b>through slaughter?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this statement of Rabbi Abba <b>is necessary in</b> a case where <b>one slaughtered a <i>tereifa</i> and found a living nine-month-old</b> fetus <b>inside it.</b> It might <b>enter your mind to say: Since Rabbi Meir said</b> an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted <b>is considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter, the slaughter of its mother should be effective to</b> render the meat of the fetus permitted for consumption, as it normally does when the mother is not a <i>tereifa</i>; and the fetus, after it is born, <b>should not require</b> its own <b>slaughter.</b> Rabbi Abba therefore <b>teaches us</b> that according to Rabbi Meir, slaughter that does not render the meat of the mother permitted for consumption does not render the fetus permitted either.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> that without Rabbi Abba’s statement, one would have thought that according to Rabbi Meir, the fetus does not require its own slaughter? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Meir say</b> that <b>a fetus removed from its mother’s womb after the mother was properly slaughtered [<i>ben pekua</i>], requires slaughter,</b> as the slaughter of the mother does not permit the fetus?
The Gemara responds: The statement of Rabbi Abba <b>is not necessary</b> for the opinion of Rabbi Meir, but it is for the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. This is <b>because Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> in one instance, <b>and holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of the Rabbis in another. In a case where one slaughtered a mother and its offspring on the same day <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted <b>is considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter. And</b> with regard to a <i>ben pekua</i>, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say the</b> proper <b>slaughter of the mother renders</b> the fetus <b>kosher,</b> i.e., the fetus does not require its own ritual slaughter.
Therefore, <b>since the Rabbis say the</b> proper <b>slaughter of the mother renders</b> the fetus <b>kosher,</b> one might conclude that with regard to a <i>tereifa</i> as well, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds <b>the slaughter of the mother should be effective to</b> render the meat of the fetus permitted for consumption, <b>and it should not require</b> its own <b>slaughter.</b> In light of this, Rabbi Abba <b>teaches us</b> that although Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi agrees with Rabbi Meir that an ineffective slaughter is considered an act of slaughter, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that in the case of a <i>tereifa</i> the slaughter of the mother is not effective for the fetus.
The Gemara addresses the second statement of Rabbi Abba: <b>And not with regard to all</b> <i>halakhot</i> did <b>Rabbi Shimon say</b> an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit is not considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter,</b> as <b>Rabbi Shimon concedes that</b> such an act of slaughter <b>renders</b> the animal <b>pure from</b> having the impure status of an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious? As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> The verse states with regard to an animal carcass: <b>“And if there dies of the animals</b>…he that touches its carcass shall be unclean” (Leviticus 11:39). The word “of” indicates that <b>some animals transmit impurity</b> as a carcass <b>and some animals do not transmit impurity. And which</b> animal does not? <b>That is a <i>tereifa</i> that</b> one <b>slaughtered.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> Rabbi Abba’s statement <b>is necessary in</b> the case of <b>one who slaughters a <i>tereifa</i>, and it is a non-sacred</b> animal <b>in the Temple courtyard. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> a known <b><i>tereifa</i>, and likewise one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>and it was found</b> to be <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> and <b>this and that</b> were <b>non-sacred</b> animals slaughtered <b>in the Temple courtyard, Rabbi Shimon permits</b> one <b>to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from them, as one is not considered to have transgressed the prohibition against slaughtering a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard. <b>And the Rabbis prohibit</b> one to derive benefit from them.
Accordingly, it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since Rabbi Shimon says</b> it is <b>permitted to derive benefit</b> from such an animal, <b>evidently</b> slaughtering a <i>tereifa</i> <b>is not considered slaughter at all.</b> Therefore, <b>say</b> that slaughter <b>does not</b> have the ability to <b>purify</b> the <i>tereifa</i> <b>from</b> having <b>the status of</b> a ritually impure <b>animal carcass either.</b> Rabbi Abba therefore <b>teaches us</b> that even according to Rabbi Shimon, the slaughter is effective to remove it from the status of a carcass.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: And</b> does <b>Rabbi Shimon hold</b> that the prohibition against deriving benefit from <b>non-sacred</b> animals slaughtered <b>in the Temple courtyard is by Torah law?</b> Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: <b>Yes</b> he does. <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Temura</i> 33b) that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Non-sacred</b> animals <b>that were slaughtered in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard shall be burned in the fire. And likewise, an undomesticated animal that was slaughtered in the Temple courtyard</b> shall be burned in the fire. Abaye continues: <b>Granted, if you say</b> the meat of a non-sacred domesticated animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard is forbidden <b>by Torah law, this is</b> the reason why <b>we decree</b> that the meat of <b>an undomesticated animal</b> is prohibited as well, <b>due to</b> the Torah prohibition against deriving benefit from the meat of <b>a domesticated animal.</b>
<b>But if you say</b> the meat of domesticated animals is forbidden <b>by rabbinic law</b> then the mishna is difficult: <b>What is the reason</b> the meat of a non-sacred <b>domesticated animal</b> is forbidden? It is forbidden <b>lest one</b> see someone consuming this meat outside the Temple courtyard and <b>arrive</b> at the erroneous conclusion that it is permitted <b>to partake of sacrificial</b> meat <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard. If so, the prohibition against deriving benefit from the meat of a non-sacred domesticated animal is itself a rabbinic <b>decree, and will we</b> then <b>proceed to issue a decree</b> prohibiting one to derive benefit from a non-sacred undomesticated animal in order <b>to</b> prevent the violation of <b>a decree?</b>
§ The mishna teaches that one who stabs an undomesticated animal or bird, or who tears loose its windpipe and gullet, is exempt from covering the blood. With regard to this the Gemara relates: <b>Moths infested the flax of Rabbi Ḥiyya. He came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi to ask how to get rid of the moths. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: Take a bird and slaughter</b> it <b>over the tub of water</b> in which the flax was soaked, <b>as</b> the moths will <b>smell the blood and leave</b> the flax.
The Gemara asks: <b>How could</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>do this? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who slaughters</b> a bird or an undomesticated animal, <b>and</b> does so only because he <b>needs the blood, is</b> nevertheless <b>obligated to cover</b> the blood and may not use it for any other purpose? Rather, <b>how should</b> one who needs the blood <b>act?</b> He <b>either stabs it or tears loose</b> its windpipe and its gullet, so that it is not killed with an act of slaughter. How, then, could Rabbi Ḥiyya use the blood of the bird that he slaughtered to rid his flax of the moths?
The Gemara responds: <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, <b>he said</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>Go out</b> and <b>render</b> the bird <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> and then slaughter it, as the mishna teaches that one who slaughters a <i>tereifa</i> is not required to cover its blood. <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, <b>he said</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>Go out</b> and <b>tear loose</b> the bird’s windpipe and gullet.
The Gemara asks: <b>According to the one who says</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>Go out</b> and <b>render</b> the bird <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, what is the reason</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>did not say: Go out</b> and <b>tear loose</b> its windpipe and gullet?
<b>And if you would say</b> the reason is because Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>slaughter of a bird is not</b> obligatory <b>by Torah law, and</b> consequently <b>the tearing loose</b> of <b>its</b> windpipe and gullet <b>is</b> considered <b>its slaughter</b> such that he would be required to cover the blood, this is untenable. As <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse states: “And you shall slaughter…<b>as I have commanded you”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21). This <b>teaches that Moses was</b> previously <b>commanded</b> concerning the mitzvot of slaughter, i.e., he was taught <b>about the gullet and the windpipe,</b> that the cutting of these <i>simanim</i> constitutes slaughter, <b>and about</b> the requirement to cut the <b>majority of one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>of a bird, and about</b> the requirement to cut <b>the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>of an animal.</b> If so, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that the slaughter of a bird is obligatory by Torah law.

Daf 86a

The Gemara responds: Rav Dimi <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary.</b> That is, <b>it is not necessary</b> to teach: <b>Go out</b> and <b>tear loose, since</b> it is obvious that <b>this is not</b> considered <b>slaughter at all</b> and one is not required to cover the blood. <b>But</b> with regard to the instruction: <b>Go out</b> and <b>render</b> the bird <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, I would say</b> that an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter, and</b> the blood of this bird <b>should require covering.</b> Therefore, Rav Dimi <b>teaches us in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> (85a), that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds with regard to the mitzva of covering the blood that an act of slaughter that is not fit to render the meat permitted is not considered an act of slaughter, and one is therefore not required to cover the blood of this bird.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>Go out</b> and <b>tear loose</b> the windpipe and gullet, <b>what is the reason</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>did not say: Go out</b> and <b>render</b> the bird <b>a <i>tereifa</i>? And if you would say</b> the reason is because Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted <b>is</b> considered an act of <b>slaughter,</b> and one would be required to cover the blood, this is untenable. As <b>doesn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>saw</b> as correct <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon,</b> that an ineffective slaughter is not considered an act of slaughter <b>with regard to</b> the mitzva of <b>covering the blood, and taught it</b> in the mishna here <b>using the term: The Rabbis?</b>
The Gemara responds: Ravin <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary.</b> That is, <b>it is not necessary</b> to teach: <b>Go out</b> and <b>render</b> the bird <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, since</b> an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> to render the meat permitted <b>is not</b> considered <b>slaughter</b> and one would not be required to cover the blood of the bird. <b>But</b> with regard to the instruction: <b>Go out</b> and <b>tear loose</b> the windpipe and gullet, <b>I would say</b> that the <b>slaughter of a bird is not</b> obligatory <b>by Torah law</b> to render it permitted for consumption, <b>and</b> consequently, <b>the tearing loose</b> of <b>its</b> windpipe and gullet <b>is</b> considered <b>its slaughter and</b> the blood of this bird <b>should require covering.</b> Therefore, Ravin <b>teaches us</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that the slaughter of a bird is obligatory by Torah law, as he himself derives from the verse: <b>“As I have commanded you”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21).
§ The Gemara questions the very occurrence of the incident involving Rabbi Ḥiyya: <b>And could moths have infested his flax? But doesn’t Ravin bar Abba say, and some say Rabbi Avin bar Sheva says: From when the people of the Exile ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael <b>there ceased</b> to be <b>meteors, earthquakes,</b> storm <b>winds, and thunder; and their wine did not sour, and their flax was not stricken</b> with an infestation of moths; <b>and the Sages placed their eyes,</b> i.e., attributed these phenomena, <b>to</b> the merit of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and his sons,</b> who ascended from Babylonia? If so, how was Rabbi Ḥiyya’s flax affected?
The Gemara responds: <b>When their merit is effective,</b> it is effective <b>for the</b> rest of the <b>world but not for themselves.</b> And this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>that Rav Yehuda says</b> in the name of <b>Rav, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Each and every day a Divine Voice emerges and says: The entire world is sustained in the merit of Ḥanina</b> ben Dosa, <b>My son, and</b> yet for <b>Ḥanina, My son, a <i>kav</i> of carobs,</b> i.e., a very small amount of inferior food, <b>is sufficient</b> to sustain him <b>from</b> one <b>Shabbat eve to</b> the next <b>Shabbat eve.</b> Similarly, the merit of Rabbi Ḥiyya and his sons was effective for others but not for themselves.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor who slaughtered</b> an undomesticated animal or a bird, <b>and others saw them</b> and ensured that the slaughter was properly performed, in which case the slaughter is valid (see 2a), one who oversaw the slaughter is <b>obligated to cover</b> the blood. If they slaughtered the animals <b>among themselves</b> without supervision, one is <b>exempt</b> from the obligation to cover the blood.
<b>And likewise with regard to the matter of</b> slaughtering <b>a mother and its offspring</b> on the same day, if a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor <b>slaughtered</b> an undomesticated mother animal <b>and others saw them,</b> it is <b>prohibited to slaughter</b> its offspring <b>after them.</b> If they slaughtered the mother animal <b>among themselves, Rabbi Meir deems</b> it <b>permitted to slaughter</b> its offspring <b>after them and the Rabbis deem</b> it <b>prohibited. And</b> the Rabbis <b>concede that if one slaughtered</b> the offspring thereafter <b>that he does not incur the forty</b> lashes, as it is possible the mother was not properly slaughtered.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis, what is different</b> about <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna that discusses the covering of the blood, <b>where they do not disagree</b> with the statement that if a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor slaughtered an animal without supervision one is exempt from the obligation to cover the blood, which indicates the Rabbis hold that such an act of slaughter is not considered an act of slaughter; <b>and what is different</b> about <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna that discusses the prohibition against slaughtering a mother and its offspring on the same day, <b>where they disagree</b> with Rabbi Meir and hold that if a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor slaughtered a mother animal without supervision one is prohibited to subsequently slaughter its offspring, indicating they hold that such an act of slaughter is in fact considered an act of slaughter?
The Gemara responds: Actually, it is uncertain whether this slaughter is valid or not. With regard to <b>the first clause, if we say one is obligated to cover</b> the blood from an unsupervised slaughter, people might <b>say</b> this is because <b>the slaughter</b> performed by these people <b>is proper, and they will come to eat</b> meat <b>from their slaughter,</b> and it is in fact forbidden to eat from their slaughter. Therefore, the Rabbis did not require the covering of the blood.
The Gemara challenges: If so, then with regard to <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>as well, since the Rabbis say</b> it is <b>prohibited to slaughter</b> the offspring of the mother <b>after them,</b> people might <b>say</b> this is because <b>the slaughter</b> performed by these people <b>is proper, and they will come to eat</b> meat <b>from their slaughter.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: With regard to <b>the latter clause,</b> prohibiting the slaughter of the offspring will not cause people to conclude the unsupervised slaughter of the mother by disqualified people was valid. Rather, <b>they will say:</b> The reason the offspring is not slaughtered is <b>because</b> the owner <b>does not need the meat.</b> The Gemara asks: But with regard to <b>the first clause as well,</b> covering the blood will not lead one to conclude that the unsupervised slaughter was valid, as people <b>will say:</b> He is covering the blood <b>because he needs to clean his courtyard</b> of the blood. If so, let the Rabbis deem one obligated to cover the blood.
The Gemara rejects this: But if a disqualified person <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>in a garbage dump, what can be said</b> to allow the covering of the blood? Obviously, people will not assume one covers the blood in order to clean a garbage dump. Similarly, if one <b>comes to consult</b> the court, <b>what can be said?</b> That is, if one sees from a distance that a disqualified person slaughtered an animal and the blood is uncovered, and he comes to consult the court with regard to the obligation to cover the blood, if the court tells him to cover the blood he might conclude that this is because the unsupervised slaughter was valid. Accordingly, since there are scenarios in which one might mistakenly conclude that the unsupervised slaughter of inept people is valid, the Rabbis concede that one is exempt from covering the blood of such an act of slaughter in all cases.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to your reasoning</b> that the Rabbis are concerned for the aforementioned scenarios, then with regard to <b>the latter clause as well,</b> if one <b>comes to consult</b> the court with regard to the slaughter of the offspring, <b>what can be said?</b> That is, if one sees a disqualified person slaughter the mother, and he comes to ask the court whether he may slaughter the offspring on the same day, if the court prohibits him from slaughtering it he might conclude that this is because the slaughter of the mother was valid. Why, then, do the Rabbis prohibit one from slaughtering the offspring?
The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>the Rabbis disagree concerning the entire matter,</b> i.e., they disagree with regard to covering the blood as well, and hold that if a disqualified person slaughtered an animal while unsupervised, one must cover the blood; <b>and</b> the Rabbis <b>waited for Rabbi Meir until he concluded his statement, and then they disagreed with him</b> on both accounts.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>granted,</b> the opinion of the <b>Rabbis</b> is understandable, as they consistently rule <b>stringently.</b> That is, although it is prohibited to consume the meat of an unsupervised slaughter performed by a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, the Rabbis require one to cover the blood and prohibit one to slaughter the offspring, due to concern that the person may have performed a valid slaughter. <b>But</b> with regard to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> that one is exempt from covering the blood and that one may slaughter the offspring on the same day, <b>what is the reason</b> he does not rule stringently due to uncertainty?
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Meir would deem</b> one <b>liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for</b> eating from <b>the slaughter of</b> a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, <b>due to</b> violation of the prohibition against eating from <b>an animal carcass.</b> According to Rabbi Meir there is no uncertainty with regard to such slaughter, and it is not considered an act of slaughter at all. Consequently, one may become liable to receive lashes for its consumption. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? Rabbi Ami says: Since the majority of actions</b> of a deaf-mute, imbecile, and a minor <b>are bungled,</b> i.e., they are performed incompetently, it can be assumed that their slaughter was performed improperly as well.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> said <b>to Rav Pappa: Why</b> did Rabbi Ami <b>specifically</b> state that the reasoning of Rabbi Meir is based on the assumption that the <b>majority</b> of their actions are bungled? <b>Even</b> if only <b>a minority</b> of their actions are bungled and the majority are performed competently, Rabbi Meir would <b>also</b> maintain that the animal is considered a carcass, <b>as Rabbi Meir is concerned for a minority</b> when it can be combined with a presumptive status. If so, <b>append the minority to the presumptive status</b> of an animal prior to its slaughter, i.e., that it is prohibited for consumption, <b>and the majority</b> of competent acts of slaughter <b>is</b> thereby <b>weakened.</b>
The Gemara proves that Rabbi Meir is concerned for the minority: <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 3:8): In the case of a ritually impure <b>child who is found alongside</b> ritually pure <b>started dough, and</b> he has <b>risen dough in his hand</b> that may have been removed from the larger portion of started dough, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> the started dough <b>pure.</b> This is because there is no proof the child touched it; he might have been given the piece by someone else. <b>And the Rabbis deem it impure,</b> as they assume he touched the started dough. The child is presumed to be impure <b>because it is the manner of a child to handle</b> items. <b>And we say</b> with regard to this mishna: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Meir? He holds</b> that <b>a majority of children handle</b> items, in this case the dough, that are within reach, <b>and a minority do not handle</b> items within reach, <b>and</b> the <b>dough</b> itself <b>retains a presumptive status of purity</b> since its impurity has not been definitively determined.

Daf 86b

One <b>appends</b> the <b>minority</b> of children who do not handle items within reach <b>to the presumptive status</b> of purity of the dough, <b>and</b> consequently the force of the <b>majority</b> of children who handle items within reach <b>is weakened.</b> Therefore, the dough is considered pure. Similarly, with regard to slaughter performed by inept people, why does Rabbi Ami state that the reason behind Rabbi Meir’s opinion is due to a majority? Let even a minority of bungled acts of slaughter join with the presumptive prohibited status of the animal to render this animal a carcass.
The Gemara responds that the two cases are not comparable: <b>If they said</b> one may append the minority to the presumptive status with regard to a case of <b>uncertain ritual impurity</b> in order <b>to render</b> the dough <b>pure, will they say</b> that one may rely on a minority in the case of <b>an uncertain prohibition</b> in order <b>to permit</b> it? In other words, without the fact that a majority of the acts of slaughter of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor are bungled, Rabbi Meir could neither deem one exempt from covering the blood nor allow one to slaughter the offspring immediately. Consequently, it is due only to the majority that Rabbi Meir deems one liable for violation of the prohibition against consuming an animal carcass when consuming meat from their slaughter.
§ With regard to the dispute in the mishna, the Gemara notes: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>ruled in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who held that if a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor slaughtered a mother animal, one may subsequently slaughter its offspring; <b>and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi also <b>ruled in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who held that it is prohibited to slaughter it. The Gemara asks: <b>Which of</b> these two rulings <b>is the later,</b> definitive ruling, and which ruling is the retracted one?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from an incident: <b>Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, and Rabbi Zeira were standing in the marketplace of Caesarea, at the entrance to the study hall. Rabbi Ami exited</b> the study hall <b>and found</b> the two of <b>them</b> standing there. Rabbi Ami <b>said to them: Have I not told you</b> that <b>at the time</b> when the <b>study hall</b> is in session <b>you should not stand outside,</b> as <b>perhaps there is a person</b> inside the study hall <b>who requires</b> clarification of <b>a <i>halakha</i>, and he will become bothered</b> by it because you will not be inside to assist in offering the proper explanation?
<b>Rabbi Zeira entered</b> the study hall, whereas <b>Rabbi Abba did not enter.</b> The students <b>were sitting and raising a dilemma: Which of</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s two rulings <b>is the later</b> one? <b>Rabbi Zeira said to them: You did not let me</b> know that this is your dilemma while I was outside, which would have allowed <b>me</b> to <b>ask the elder one,</b> i.e., Rabbi Abba, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, since <b>perhaps he heard</b> the answer <b>from his father,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba. <b>And</b> perhaps <b>his father</b> heard it <b>from Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba would review his studies in front of Rabbi Yoḥanan every thirty days.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about it?</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof: <b>Rabbi Elazar sent</b> a message <b>to the</b> Jews in <b>exile,</b> i.e., Babylonia: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>ruled in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>also ruled in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> Why did Rabbi Elazar disregard that ruling? The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> Rabbi Elazar’s message that <b>this</b> ruling of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, which is in accordance with Rabbi Meir, <b>is the later one?</b> The Gemara affirms: One may in fact <b>conclude from</b> here that this is so.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>slaughtered one hundred undomesticated animals in one place, one covering</b> of the blood suffices <b>for all</b> the animals and there is no obligation to cover the blood of each animal separately. Likewise, if one slaughtered <b>one hundred birds in one place, one covering</b> of the blood suffices <b>for all</b> the birds. If one slaughtered <b>an undomesticated animal and a bird in one place, one covering for all of</b> the blood is sufficient. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If one <b>slaughtered an undomesticated animal, he should cover its</b> blood immediately <b>and</b> only <b>thereafter he should slaughter the bird.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the mitzva of covering the blood: “An undomesticated animal or bird” (Leviticus 17:13). <b>“Undomesticated animal”</b> is inclusive, i.e., <b>any</b> number of animals is <b>included</b> in the term <b>undomesticated animal, whether many or few.</b> Likewise, <b>“bird”</b> is inclusive, i.e., <b>any</b> amount is <b>included</b> in the term <b>bird, whether many or few. From here</b> the Rabbis <b>stated:</b> If one <b>slaughtered one hundred undomesticated animals in one place, one covering</b> of the blood suffices <b>for all</b> the animals. Likewise, if one slaughtered <b>one hundred birds in one place, one covering</b> of the blood suffices <b>for all</b> the birds. If one slaughtered <b>an undomesticated animal and a bird in one place, one covering for all of</b> the blood is sufficient.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If one <b>slaughtered an undomesticated animal, he should cover its</b> blood immediately <b>and</b> only <b>thereafter he should slaughter the bird, as it is stated: “An undomesticated animal or bird”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). The term “or” indicates that each type must be attended to separately.
The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: <b>But</b> the next verse <b>states: “For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> the Rabbis <b>responding to</b> Rabbi Yehuda with this statement? The Gemara explains: <b>This is what the Rabbis are saying to him: This</b> term <b>“or”</b> that interposes between an undomesticated animal and a bird <b>is needed to separate</b> them, in order to indicate that the obligation to cover the blood applies after slaughtering either an undomesticated animal or a bird. If not for the term “or” one might have thought the obligation to cover the blood takes effect only after slaughtering both an undomesticated animal and a bird. Accordingly, one cannot derive from this term that the blood of an undomesticated animal and a bird must be covered separately.
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> responds to this: The source <b>for separating</b> the obligations with regard to an undomesticated animal and a bird <b>is derived from</b> the verse: “And he shall pour out <b>its blood”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). The verse makes reference to the blood of only one animal, indicating that the obligation applies after slaughtering either a bird or an undomesticated animal. <b>And the Rabbis</b> respond that <b>“its blood”</b> also <b>indicates many,</b> as the term: Blood, can refer to any amount of blood. This is demonstrated by that <b>which is written: “For as to the life of all flesh, the blood thereof is all one with the life thereof”</b> (Leviticus 17:14).
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> Although Rabbi Yehuda holds that one first covers the blood of an undomesticated animal before slaughtering the bird, <b>Rabbi Yehuda would concede with regard to the matter of</b> the <b>blessing</b> over their slaughter, i.e., <b>that one recites only one blessing.</b> The Gemara questions this assertion: <b>Ravina said to Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava,</b> said <b>to Rav Ashi:</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the incident that occurred with <b>the students of Rav?</b>
<b>As</b> it occurred that <b>Rav Beruna and Rav Ḥananel, the students of Rav, were sitting</b> together <b>at a meal,</b> and <b>Rav Yeiva the Elder stood over them</b> to serve them. <b>They said to him: Give</b> us a cup of wine over which <b>to recite the blessings</b> of Grace after Meals. <b>They then</b> changed their mind and <b>said to him: Give</b> us a cup of wine <b>to drink. Rav Yeiva the Elder said to them</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>Rav said: Once</b> someone at a meal <b>says: Give</b> me a cup over which <b>to recite the blessings</b> of Grace after Meals, it is <b>prohibited for him to drink</b> any more <b>wine,</b> since he has expressed his desire to conclude his meal. If he now wishes to drink more wine, he must recite a blessing before drinking it. Ravina asks: <b>Here too, since he is required to cover</b> the blood of the undomesticated animal before slaughtering the bird, there is an interruption between the acts of slaughter, and <b>he has</b> therefore <b>become obligated to</b> recite a new <b>blessing</b> before slaughtering the bird.

Daf 87a

The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the incident involving the students of Rav, it is <b>impossible to drink and recite a blessing simultaneously.</b> Accordingly, by requesting a cup over which to recite the blessing of Grace after Meals, they demonstrated their desire to cease drinking. <b>Here,</b> when one covers the blood of the undomesticated animal before slaughtering the bird, it is <b>possible to slaughter</b> the bird <b>with the one</b> hand <b>and cover</b> the blood of the undomesticated animal <b>with the</b> other <b>one.</b> Accordingly, the act of covering the blood of the undomesticated animal is not considered an interruption of the acts of slaughter, since they could have been performed simultaneously.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>slaughtered</b> an undomesticated animal or bird <b>and did not cover</b> the blood, <b>and another</b> person <b>saw</b> the uncovered blood, the second person is <b>obligated to cover</b> the blood. If one <b>covered</b> the blood <b>and it was</b> then <b>uncovered,</b> he is <b>exempt from covering it</b> again. If <b>the wind</b> blew earth on the blood and <b>covered it,</b> and it was consequently uncovered, he is <b>obligated to cover</b> the blood.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall pour out</b> its blood <b>and cover</b> it with earth” (Leviticus 17:13), indicating that <b>the one who poured out</b> its blood, i.e., slaughtered the animal, <b>shall cover it.</b> If one <b>slaughtered</b> the animal or bird <b>and did not cover</b> the blood, <b>and another person saw</b> the uncovered blood, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the person who saw the blood <b>is obligated to cover</b> it? It is derived from the following verse, <b>as it is stated: “Therefore I said to the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 17:12), which is <b>a warning to all the children of Israel</b> to fulfill the mitzva of covering the blood.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall pour out</b> its blood <b>and cover</b> it with earth,” indicating that <b>with that which he poured out</b> the blood <b>he shall cover it,</b> i.e., he must use his hand, and <b>he</b> may <b>not cover it with</b> his <b>foot, so that mitzvot will not be contemptible to him. It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall pour out</b> its blood <b>and cover</b> it with earth,” indicating that <b>the one who poured out</b> the blood <b>shall cover it. An incident</b> occurred <b>involving one who slaughtered</b> an undomesticated animal or bird <b>and another</b> individual <b>preempted</b> him <b>and covered</b> the blood, <b>and Rabban Gamliel deemed him obligated to give ten gold coins to</b> the one who performed the act of slaughter.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Are these ten gold coins <b>compensation</b> for the stolen <b>mitzva or</b> are they <b>compensation</b> for the stolen <b>blessing</b> recited over the mitzva? The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference?</b> The difference is <b>with regard to</b> a similar case involving <b>Grace after Meals. If you say</b> the coins are <b>compensation for the mitzva,</b> then with regard to Grace after Meals, since all its blessings constitute <b>one</b> mitzva, one would be obligated to give only ten gold coins. <b>But if you say</b> they are <b>compensation for the</b> lost <b>blessing,</b> then with regard to Grace after Meals the compensation <b>is forty</b> gold coins, since Grace after Meals comprises four blessings. <b>What</b> is the conclusion?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from an incident in <b>which a certain heretic said to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>He who created mountains did not create wind, and he who created wind did not create mountains;</b> rather, each was created by a separate deity, <b>as it is written: “For behold, He Who forms the mountains and He Who creates the wind”</b> (Amos 4:13), indicating that there are two deities: One who forms the mountains and one who creates the wind. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: Imbecile, go to the end of the verse,</b> which states: <b>“The Lord, the God of hosts, is His name.”</b> The verse emphasizes that God is the One Who both forms and creates.
The heretic <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Give me three days’ time and I will respond to you</b> with <b>a rebuttal</b> of your claim. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>sat</b> and fasted <b>three</b> days of <b>fasting</b> while awaiting the heretic, in order that he would not find a rebuttal. <b>When</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>wanted to have a meal</b> at the conclusion of those three days, <b>they said to him:</b> That <b>heretic is standing at the doorway.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>recited</b> the following verse about himself: <b>“They put gall into my food,</b> and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink” (Psalms 69:22), i.e., my meal is embittered with the presence of this heretic.
When Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi came to the door he saw that it was in fact a different heretic, not the one who asked for three days to prepare a rebuttal. This heretic <b>said to him: Rabbi, I am a bearer of good tidings for you: Your enemy did not find a response, and he threw himself from the roof and died.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> the heretic: Since you have brought me good tidings, <b>would you like to dine with me?</b> The heretic <b>said to him: Yes. After they ate and drank,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> the heretic: Would <b>you</b> like to <b>drink the cup of blessing,</b> i.e., the cup of wine over which the Grace after Meals is recited, <b>or</b> would <b>you</b> like to <b>take forty gold coins</b> instead, and I will recite the Grace after Meals? The heretic <b>said to him: I</b> will <b>drink the cup of blessing. A Divine Voice emerged and said: The cup of blessing is worth forty gold coins.</b> Evidently, each one of the blessings in the Grace after Meals is worth ten gold coins.
The Gemara adds: <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: That family</b> of the heretic who dined with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>still exists among the prominent</b> families <b>of Rome, and</b> that family <b>is called: The family of bar Luyyanus.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that if one <b>covered</b> the blood <b>and it was</b> then <b>uncovered</b> he is not obligated to cover it again. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: What is different</b> about this case from the mitzva of <b>returning a lost item, where the Master said:</b> The verse states with regard to the obligation to return a lost item: <b>“You shall return</b> them to your brother” (Deuteronomy 22:1), <b>even one hundred times?</b>
Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Aḥa: <b>There,</b> in the verse discussing the obligation to return a lost item, <b>a restriction is not written</b> in the verse to limit the obligation. <b>Here,</b> in the verse discussing the obligation to cover the blood, <b>a restriction is written,</b> as the verse states: <b>“And he shall cover it.”</b> The usage of the term “it” indicates that one must cover the blood only one time.
§ The mishna teaches that if <b>the wind</b> blew earth on the blood and <b>covered it</b> one is obligated to cover the blood. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> if the blood <b>was again uncovered. But</b> if the blood <b>was not again uncovered</b> one is <b>exempt from</b> the obligation <b>to cover it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And when</b> the blood <b>was again uncovered, what of it? Isn’t it</b> already <b>rejected</b> from the mitzva of covering since it was covered by the wind? <b>Rav Pappa said: That is to say</b> that <b>there is no permanent</b> rejection <b>with regard to mitzvot.</b> Although the wind covered the blood, the mitzva to cover it was not rendered null; rather, the mitzva simply could not be performed. Consequently, once the blood is again uncovered, the mitzva to cover the blood remains in place.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even if the wind covered the blood and it remained covered, why is one exempt from performing the mitzva of covering the blood? <b>What is different</b> about this case <b>from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>one slaughters</b> an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>and</b> its <b>blood is absorbed by the ground,</b> one is <b>obligated to cover</b> the blood? The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where the impression</b> of the blood <b>is</b> still <b>recognizable,</b> i.e., it was not entirely absorbed in the ground.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of the <b>blood</b> of an undomesticated animal or bird <b>that was mixed with water, if there is in</b> the mixture <b>the appearance of blood</b> one is <b>obligated to cover</b> it. If the blood <b>was mixed with wine one views</b> the wine <b>as though it is water,</b> and if a mixture with that amount of water would have the appearance of blood one is obligated to cover it. Likewise, if the blood of an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>was mixed with the blood of a domesticated animal,</b> which one does not have to cover,

Daf 87b

<b>or with blood of the undomesticated animal</b> that did not flow from the neck and does not require covering, <b>one views</b> the blood <b>as though it is water. Rabbi Yehuda says: Blood does not nullify blood.</b> Therefore, even if the undomesticated animal’s blood, which one must cover, is not recognizable in this mixture, he is obligated to cover the mixture nevertheless.
With regard to <b>blood that spurts</b> outside the pit over which the animal was slaughtered, or onto a wall, <b>and</b> blood <b>that</b> remained <b>on the</b> slaughtering <b>knife,</b> one is <b>obligated to cover</b> it. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> is this the <i>halakha</i>? <b>When no blood</b> remains <b>there</b> from the slaughter <b>except that</b> blood. <b>But</b> if <b>blood</b> remains <b>there</b> from the slaughter <b>that is not that</b> blood, he is <b>exempt from covering</b> it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 77b): In the case of <b>blood</b> of an offering fit for sacrifice <b>that was mixed with water, if</b> the mixture <b>has the appearance of blood</b> it is <b>fit</b> for sprinkling on the altar, even though the majority of the mixture is water. If the blood <b>was mixed with</b> red <b>wine, one views</b> the wine <b>as though it is water.</b> If that amount of water would leave the mixture with the appearance of blood it is fit for presentation. And likewise, if the blood <b>was mixed with the blood of</b> a non-sacred <b>domesticated animal or the blood of</b> a non-sacred <b>undomesticated animal, one considers</b> the non-sacred blood <b>as though it is water. Rabbi Yehuda says: Blood does not nullify blood.</b> Therefore, the priest presents the blood of the mixture on the altar.
The mishna teaches that in a case where water became mixed with the blood of an offering, if the mixture has the appearance of blood it is fit, despite the fact that there is more water than blood. Concerning this <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the <b>water fell into</b> the <b>blood. But</b> in a case where the <b>blood fell into</b> the <b>water,</b> the <b>first</b> drop of blood, and then the next <b>first</b> drop of blood, are <b>nullified</b> in the water, i.e., each drop is nullified in turn. Consequently, the mixture is unfit for presentation, regardless of whether it has the appearance of blood.
<b>Rav Pappa says: But with regard to</b> the mitzva of <b>covering</b> the blood of birds or undomesticated animals that are slaughtered, <b>it is not so.</b> In this case, even if the blood fell into water the mitzva of covering applies to it, provided the mixture has the appearance of blood. The blood is not nullified by the water <b>because there is no</b> permanent <b>rejection with regard to mitzvot</b> other than those that relate to sacrificial rites. Therefore, its nullification was merely temporary, but once there is enough blood in the water it reassumes its status of blood.
§ With regard to mixtures of blood and water, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: All</b> mixtures of blood and water that maintain <b>a reddish hue</b> are considered blood and <b>effect atonement</b> by being presented on the altar, <b>and render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to contracting ritual impurity, <b>and are</b> included in the <b>obligation of covering</b> the blood provided that the blood is from the slaughter of an undomesticated animal or bird. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is Rav Yehuda <b>teaching us?</b> If he is teaching us that such mixtures <b>effect atonement, we</b> already <b>learn</b> this from the mishna in tractate <i>Zevaḥim</i>. And if he is teaching us that such mixtures are included in the <b>obligation of covering</b> the blood, <b>we</b> already <b>learn</b> this in the mishna here.
Rather, it <b>was necessary for</b> Rav Yehuda to teach that such mixtures <b>render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to contracting ritual impurity, as this was not taught in a mishna. The Gemara challenges: It is <b>also</b> unnecessary to teach that such mixtures <b>render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to contracting ritual impurity. <b>If</b> the mixture has the status of <b>blood it renders</b> food <b>susceptible,</b> as does blood, <b>and if</b> the mixture has the status of <b>water it renders</b> food susceptible, as does water. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> this statement is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> the blood <b>was mixed with rainwater,</b> which does not render food susceptible without the intent or desire of the owner of the food. If the mixture is considered blood it renders food susceptible.
The Gemara challenges: With regard to <b>rainwater as well, since one took</b> it <b>and placed</b> it into a vessel containing blood, <b>he has ascribed significance</b> to the rainwater and it should be capable of rendering food susceptible. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> this statement is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> the rainwater <b>was mixed</b> with the blood <b>by itself,</b> i.e., it was not gathered and poured purposefully.
<b>Rabbi Asi of Neharbil says:</b> The statement of Rav Yehuda is referring <b>to blood plasma,</b> i.e., if the plasma has a reddish hue due to the blood, it has the status of blood and can render food susceptible to contracting ritual impurity. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti said:</b> Consumption of this plasma is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who consumes blood (see Leviticus 17:14), <b>provided that there is</b> at least one <b>olive-bulk</b> of actual blood. <b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> Blood plasma that issues from a corpse that has a reddish hue <b>imparts ritual impurity in a tent, provided that there is</b> at least <b>a quarter-</b><i>log</i> of actual blood, which is the amount of a corpse’s blood that imparts ritual impurity.
<b>We learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Oholot</i> 4:5): <b>All liquids</b> that issue <b>from a corpse,</b> e.g., teardrops or breastmilk, <b>are ritually pure, except for its blood. And all</b> liquids that issue <b>from</b> a corpse that contain <b>a reddish hue</b> of blood <b>impart ritual impurity in a tent.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But are liquids</b> that issue from <b>a corpse ritually pure? And raise a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Tevul Yom</i> 2:1): With regard to <b>liquids</b> that issue <b>from one who immersed that day, liquids that issue from him</b> have the same status <b>as liquids that he touches.</b>

Daf 88a

<b>And</b> both <b>these and those,</b> i.e., both liquids that issue from one who immersed himself that day and liquids he touches, <b>do not impart ritual impurity. And</b> with regard to <b>all other</b> sources of <b>impurity, whether minor</b> sources <b>or major</b> sources, <b>liquids that issue from them</b> have the same status <b>as liquids that touch them, and</b> both <b>these and those have</b> first-degree ritual impurity, since they touched a primary source of ritual impurity upon exiting the source. This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>except for a liquid that is</b> itself <b>a primary source of</b> ritual <b>impurity.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>minor</b> sources <b>and what</b> is the meaning of <b>major</b> sources? <b>What, is it not</b> that the term: <b>Minor</b> sources, is referring to <b>a creeping animal or a <i>zav</i>, and</b> that the term: <b>Major</b> sources, is referring to <b>a corpse?</b> If so, the mishna teaches that all liquids that issue from a corpse are ritually impure, in contradiction to the <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the term: <b>Minor</b> sources, is referring to <b>a creeping animal,</b> e.g., urine found inside its body, which is not considered ritually impure, <b>and</b> the term: <b>Major</b> sources, is referring to <b>a <i>zav</i>,</b> concerning whom all liquids that issue from him are ritually impure. By contrast, liquids that issue from a corpse are ritually pure with the exception of blood.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> with regard to <b>a <i>zav</i>, concerning whom the Sages decreed</b> that liquids that issue from him are ritually impure, <b>and what is different</b> with regard to <b>a corpse, concerning which the Sages did not decree</b> that liquids that issue from it are ritually impure? The Gemara responds: In the case of <b>a <i>zav</i>, since people do not</b> naturally <b>separate from him, the Sages decreed</b> additional restrictions <b>with regard to him</b> in order to prevent others from contracting impurity from liquids that issue from a <i>zav</i> that are impure by Torah law. In the case of <b>a corpse, since people</b> naturally <b>separate from it, the Sages did not decree</b> additional restrictions <b>with regard to it.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that one is obligated to cover <b>blood that spurts</b> outside the pit over which the animal was slaughtered, or onto the wall, <b>and</b> blood <b>that</b> remained <b>on the</b> slaughtering <b>knife.</b> With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall cover it”</b> (Leviticus 17:13), which <b>teaches that</b> one is <b>obligated to cover blood that spurted and</b> blood <b>that</b> remained <b>on the</b> slaughtering <b>knife. Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> is this the <i>halakha</i>? <b>When there is no blood except that</b> blood. <b>But</b> if <b>there is</b> other <b>blood that is not that</b> blood, one is <b>exempt from covering</b> it.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The term: <b>“And he shall cover it,” teaches that</b> one is <b>obligated to cover all</b> of the <b>blood. From here</b> the Sages <b>stated:</b> With regard to <b>blood that spurts out and</b> blood <b>that</b> remains <b>on the sides</b> of the animal’s throat where it was slaughtered, one is <b>obligated to cover</b> it. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where</b> one <b>did not</b> already <b>cover the blood of the soul,</b> i.e., the blood that flows from the place of slaughter as the animal dies. <b>But if</b> one already <b>covered the blood of the soul,</b> he is <b>exempt from</b> the obligation <b>to cover</b> the blood that spurted out or the blood remaining on the sides of the animal’s neck in the area of slaughter.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> matter <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that the expression: <b>“Its blood”</b> (Leviticus 17:13), indicates an obligation to cover <b>all of its blood,</b> even the blood that spurts out. <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>“its blood”</b> indicates that one may fulfill the mitzva with any part of the blood, <b>even</b> with <b>a small amount of its blood. And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds</b> that <b>“its blood”</b> refers to the <b>special</b> blood, i.e., the blood of the soul.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>With what</b> substances <b>may one cover</b> the blood <b>and with what</b> substances <b>may one not cover</b> the blood? <b>One</b> may <b>cover</b> the blood <b>with fine</b> granulated <b>manure, with fine sand, with lime, with</b> crushed <b>potsherd, and with a brick or</b> the <b>lid</b> of an earthenware barrel <b>that one crushed. But one may not cover</b> the blood <b>with thick manure, nor with thick,</b> clumped <b>sand, nor with a brick or the lid</b> of an earthenware barrel <b>that one did not crush. Neither may one</b> merely <b>turn a vessel over</b> the blood. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel stated a principle:</b> With regard to <b>a substance in which plants grow, one may cover</b> blood <b>with it; and</b> with regard to a substance in <b>which plants do not grow, one may not cover</b> blood <b>with it.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one may cover the blood with fine sand. The Gemara asks: <b>What is considered fine sand? Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>any</b> sand <b>that the</b> pottery <b>producer does not need to crush</b> in order to use it. The Gemara notes: <b>And some teach this</b> statement <b>in reference to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which states: <b>But one may not cover</b> the blood <b>with thick manure, nor with thick sand.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is considered thick sand? Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>any</b> sand <b>that the</b> pottery <b>producer must crush</b> in order to use it.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two versions? The Gemara responds: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to sand <b>that requires</b> some crushing <b>and</b> sand that <b>does not require</b> full crushing, i.e., <b>that crumbles</b> in one’s hand and does not require a tool. According to the first version, as long as the sand does not require crushing it may be used to cover the blood. Therefore, sand that requires crumbling may be used since it is not considered sand that requires crushing. According to the second version, any sand that requires some crushing may not be used. Therefore, sand that requires crumbling may not be used to cover the blood.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the mitzva of covering the blood: <b>“And cover it”</b> (Leviticus 17:13). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he may cover</b> the blood <b>with stones or</b> merely <b>turn a vessel over it.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “With earth.”</b> Based on this expression <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>earth</b> may be used. <b>From where</b> does one derive <b>to include fine manure, fine sand, crushed stones, crushed potsherd, fine chaff of flax,</b>

Daf 88b

<b>fine sawdust of carpenters, lime,</b> crushed <b>potsherd,</b> and <b>a brick</b> or the <b>lid</b> of an earthenware barrel <b>that one crushed? The verse states: “And cover it,”</b> i.e., with any substance. One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I</b> will <b>include even thick manure, and thick sand, filings of metal vessels, a brick</b> or <b>a lid that one did not crush, flour, bran, and coarse bran.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And cover it <b>with earth,”</b> indicating that not all substances may be used to cover the blood.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you <b>to include these</b> substances <b>and to exclude those?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>After</b> noting <b>that the verse included</b> certain substances with the term: “And cover it,” <b>and excluded</b> others with the term: “With earth,” <b>I include these</b> substances, e.g., fine sand, <b>which are a type of earth</b> in which plants grow, <b>and I exclude those</b> substances, e.g., thick sand, <b>which are not a type of earth,</b> as plants do not grow in them.
The Gemara asks: Why must the verse be interpreted in this manner? <b>Say</b> that the term: <b>“And cover it,”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> and the term: <b>“With earth,”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> Consequently, the verse constitutes <b>a generalization and a detail,</b> and according to the corresponding hermeneutical principle, <b>the generalization includes only what</b> is mentioned explicitly <b>in the detail.</b> Therefore, only <b>earth may</b> be used to cover the blood, while <b>any other</b> substance, even substances in which plants grow, may <b>not</b> be used.
<b>Rav Mari said</b> in response: One should not suggest such an interpretation <b>because</b> the term “and cover it” <b>is a generalization that requires a detail</b> to clarify its nature, <b>and any generalization that requires a detail</b> to clarify its nature <b>is not interpreted by</b> the hermeneutical principle of <b>a generalization and a detail.</b> It is necessary for the verse to state that the blood must be covered with earth in order to clarify that the mitzva of covering the blood is such that the blood must be covered with a substance that will absorb the blood, and that it does not suffice to place a vessel over it.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda taught: One may not cover</b> the blood of an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>except with a substance in which</b> seed is <b>sown and sprouts. Rava said: This</b> is <b>an absurdity [<i>burkha</i>],</b> as the mishna and <i>baraita</i> both teach that one may use substances in which seeds do not sprout.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: What is the absurdity</b> of <b>his</b> statement? <b>I said this</b> statement to Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda <b>and I said it to him from this <i>baraita</i>:</b> If one <b>is traveling in the desert,</b> where the earth is not arable, and wishes to slaughter an undomesticated animal or a bird, <b>but he does not have dirt</b> with which <b>to cover</b> the blood, <b>he may grind a gold dinar</b> into powder <b>and cover</b> the blood with it. If one <b>is traveling on a ship</b> and wants to slaughter an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>but he does not have earth</b> with which <b>to cover</b> the blood, <b>he may burn his garment and cover</b> the blood with the ashes. It is evident from the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> that desert sand, which does not allow for the sprouting of seeds, may not be used to cover the blood of an undomesticated animal or a bird.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted,</b> it is understood that <b>one may burn his garment and cover</b> the blood with the ashes, since <b>we found</b> a source for the fact that <b>ashes are called earth [<i>afar</i>],</b> as the Gemara will soon prove; accordingly, the use of ashes is in accordance with the verse: “And cover it with earth.” <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a gold dinar, from where do we</b> derive that one may grind it into powder and use it to cover the blood? <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The verse states: <b>“And it has dust of [<i>afrot</i>] gold”</b> (Job 28:6), indicating that gold is referred to as dust.
The Gemara cites a related <i>baraita</i> in which <b>the Sages taught: One may not cover</b> the blood of an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>except with earth;</b> this is <b>the statement of Beit Shammai. And Beit Hillel say: We find that ashes are called dust [<i>afar</i>], as it is stated</b> with regard to the red heifer: <b>“And for the impure they shall take from the ashes [<i>me’afar</i>] of the burning of the purification from sin”</b> (Numbers 19:17). <b>And Beit Shammai</b> respond: Ashes are <b>called dust of the burning [<i>afar sereifa</i>],</b> but <b>they are not called ordinary dust [<i>afar</i>].</b>
The Gemara notes: It is <b>taught</b> that the Sages <b>added</b> the following <b>to the</b> list of substances in the mishna with which one may cover the blood: <b>Coal dust, stibium [<i>keḥol</i>], and shavings from chiseling. And some say</b> they included <b>even arsenic [<i>zarnikh</i>].</b>
§ The Gemara cites aggadic accounts relating to the mitzva of covering the blood: <b>Rava says: As reward</b> for that <b>which our Patriarch Abraham said: “And I am but dust [<i>afar</i>] and ashes”</b> (Genesis 18:27), <b>his children merited two mitzvot: The ashes of the</b> red <b>heifer</b> (see Numbers, chapter 19) <b>and the dust of the <i>sota</i>,</b> i.e., dirt taken from the ground of the Tabernacle that is mixed into the water that examines whether or not a woman committed adultery (see Numbers 5:17).
The Gemara challenges: <b>But let</b> Rava <b>also consider the earth</b> used in the mitzva of <b>covering the blood.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>There,</b> the earth <b>does</b> serve as an <b>accessory to the mitzva</b> of covering the blood, but <b>there is no benefit</b> imparted by it. It occurs after the animal has been slaughtered and does not itself render the meat fit for consumption. By contrast, the ashes of the red heifer and the dust of the <i>sota</i> provide benefit, as the former purifies one who became ritually impure and the latter leads to peace between husband and wife when drinking the water proves that she did not commit adultery.
<b>And Rava says: As reward</b> for that <b>which our Patriarch Abraham said</b> to the king of Sodom:

Daf 89a

<b>“That</b> I will not take <b>a thread nor a shoe strap</b> nor anything that is yours” (Genesis 14:23), distancing himself from anything not rightfully his, <b>his children merited two mitzvot: The thread of sky-blue wool</b> worn on ritual fringes <b>and the strap of phylacteries.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, the strap of</b> the <b>phylacteries</b> imparts benefit, <b>as it is written: “And all the peoples of the earth shall see that the name of the Lord is called upon you;</b> and they shall be afraid of you” (Deuteronomy 28:10). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: This is</b> a reference to <b>the phylacteries of the head,</b> upon which the name of God is written. Phylacteries therefore impart the splendor and grandeur of God and are a fit reward. <b>But what is</b> the benefit imparted by <b>the thread of sky-blue wool?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: What is different about sky-blue from all other colors</b> such that it was specified for the mitzva of ritual fringes? It is <b>because sky-blue</b> dye <b>is similar</b> in its color <b>to the sea, and the sea is similar to the sky, and the sky is similar to the sapphire stone, and the sapphire stone is similar to the Throne of Glory, as it is stated: “And they saw the God of Israel; and there was under His feet</b> the like of a paved work of sapphire stone, and the like of the very heaven for clearness” (Exodus 24:10). This verse shows that the heavens are similar to sapphire, <b>and it is written:</b> “And above the firmament that was over their heads was <b>the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone”</b> (Ezekiel 1:26). Therefore, the throne is similar to the heavens. The color of sky blue dye acts as an indication of the bond between the Jewish people and the Divine Presence.
The Gemara above mentioned that Abraham refused to accept property that did not belong to him. With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Abba says: Difficult</b> is the return of <b>theft that has been consumed, as even</b> the <b>perfectly righteous are unable to return it, as it is stated:</b> “That I will not take a thread nor a shoe strap nor anything that is yours…<b>except only that which the young men have eaten with me”</b> (Genesis 14:23–24). Even the righteous Abraham was unable to return that which the young men had already consumed.
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon: Any place where you find the statements of Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, in</b> reference to <b>aggada, make your ears like a funnel [<i>ka’afarkeset</i>],</b> i.e., be receptive to his words. As Rabbi Eliezer interpreted the verse: <b>“Not because you are more in number than any people did the Lord desire you</b> and choose you, for you were the fewest of all peoples” (Deuteronomy 7:7), as follows: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to the Jewish people: I desire you, since even at a time that I bestow greatness</b> upon <b>you, you diminish,</b> i.e., humble, <b>yourselves before Me.</b>
<b>I granted greatness to Abraham,</b> yet <b>he said before Me: “And I am but dust and ashes”</b> (Genesis 18:27). I granted greatness <b>to Moses and Aaron,</b> yet Moses <b>said</b> of the two of them: <b>“And what are we”</b> (Exodus 16:7). I granted greatness <b>to David,</b> yet <b>he said: “But I am a worm, and no man”</b> (Psalms 22:7).
<b>But the</b> gentile <b>nations of the world are not so. I granted greatness to Nimrod,</b> yet <b>he said: “Come, let us build a city</b> and a tower, with its top in heaven, and let us make for ourselves a name” (Genesis 11:4). I granted greatness <b>to Pharaoh,</b> yet <b>he said: “Who is the Lord”</b> (Exodus 5:2). I granted greatness <b>to Sennacherib,</b> yet he said: <b>“Who are they among all the gods of the countries</b> that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand” (II Kings 18:35). I granted greatness <b>to Nebuchadnezzar,</b> yet <b>he said: “I will ascend above the heights of the clouds”</b> (Isaiah 14:14). I granted greatness <b>to Ḥiram, king of Tyre,</b> yet <b>he said: “I sit in the seat of God, in the heart of the seas”</b> (Ezekiel 28:2).
The Gemara relates: <b>Rava says, and some say Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says: <b>Greater</b> is <b>that</b> which <b>is stated with regard to Moses and Aaron than that</b> which <b>is stated with regard to Abraham. As with regard to Abraham it is written: “And I am but dust and ashes,” while with regard to Moses and Aaron it is written: “And what are we,”</b> i.e., we are not even dust and ashes. <b>And Rava says, and some say Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says: <b>The world endures only in the merit of Moses and Aaron. It is written here: “And what are we,” and it written elsewhere: “He hangs the earth upon nothing”</b> (Job 26:7). That is, the earth endures in the merit of those who said of themselves that they are nothing, i.e., Moses and Aaron.
With regard to that verse, <b>Rabbi Ile’a says: The world endures only in the merit of one who restrains [<i>shebolem</i>] himself during a quarrel, as it is stated: “He hangs the earth upon nothing [<i>belima</i>]. Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> The world endures only in the merit of <b>one who renders himself as if he were non-existent, as it is stated: “And underneath are the everlasting arms”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:27), i.e., one who considers himself to be underneath everything else is the everlasting arm that upholds the world.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Do you indeed [<i>ha’umnam</i>] speak as a righteous company [<i>elem</i>]? Do you judge with equity [<i>meisharim</i>] the sons of men”</b> (Psalms 58:2)? The verse is interpreted as follows: <b>What</b> should be <b>a person’s occupation [<i>umanut</i>] in this world? He should render himself</b> silent <b>as a mute [<i>ilem</i>].</b> If so, one <b>might</b> have thought that he should render himself as a mute <b>even with regard to words of Torah.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Speak as a righteous</b> company,” indicating that one should speak the righteous words of Torah. If so, he <b>might</b> have thought that one who speaks words of Torah has the right to <b>become arrogant.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Judge with equity [<i>meisharim</i>] the sons of men.”</b> Even a learned judge must take extra care to judge with equity, and not assume that he will immediately arrive at the correct understanding.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the mitzva of covering the blood: <b>Rabbi Zeira says, and some say Rabba bar Yirmeya</b> says: <b>One may cover</b> the blood of an undomesticated animal or a bird <b>with the dust of an idolatrous city.</b> The Torah states that the city and anything contained therein must be burned (see Deuteronomy 13:17). The Gemara, assuming the statement of Rabbi Zeira refers to the ashes of a burned idolatrous city, asks: <b>But why</b> may one use these ashes to cover the blood? <b>These</b> ashes <b>are items from which</b> deriving <b>benefit is prohibited,</b> as the verse states: “And there shall cleave none of the banned property to your hand” (Deuteronomy 13:18).
<b>Ze’eiri said:</b> Rabbi Zeira is not referring to the ashes of the burned city, which may not be used. Rather, his statement is <b>necessary only concerning the dust of its dust,</b> i.e., the dust of the ground of the idolatrous city, from which deriving benefit is not prohibited, <b>as it is written: “And you shall gather all its spoil into the midst of the broad place thereof, and shall burn</b> with fire the city” (Deuteronomy 13:17). Accordingly, items <b>lacking only</b> the acts of <b>gathering and burning</b> must be burned. This serves to exclude <b>this</b> dust of the ground, <b>which lacks</b> the acts of <b>removal</b> from the ground, <b>gathering, and burning.</b> The dust must also be removed from the ground before it can be gathered and burned.
<b>And Rava says:</b> One can even use the ashes from the idolatrous city to cover the blood, despite the fact that it is prohibited to derive any benefit from them. This is because <b>mitzvot were not given for benefit,</b> that is, the fulfillment of a mitzva is not considered deriving benefit, but the fulfillment of a divine decree.
The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina was sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i>,</b> that one may use the ashes of an idolatrous city to cover the blood. <b>Rav Reḥumi raised an objection to Ravina</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a shofar of idol worship,</b> from which it is prohibited to derive benefit, <b>one may not blow with it. What, is it not</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means to say that <b>if one blew</b> with it <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that one should not use such a shofar <i>ab initio</i>, but <b>if one blew</b> with it <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation.
Rav Reḥumi persists: It is taught in another <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>a <i>lulav</i> of idol worship, one may not take</b> it to perform the mitzva. <b>What, is it not</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means to say that <b>if one took</b> such a <i>lulav</i> he has <b>not fulfilled</b> his obligation? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that one should not use such a <i>lulav ab initio</i>, but <b>if one took</b> it <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if <b>one blew</b> a shofar of idolatry <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation? And isn’t it taught in another <i>baraita</i> that if <b>one took</b> a <i>lulav</i> of idolatry to perform the mitzva <b>he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation?
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> in response: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared</b> to the case of covering the blood? <b>There,</b> with regard to a shofar and <i>lulav</i> of idol worship, although the use of such items for a mitzva does not constitute benefit, one cannot fulfill his obligation with them, because

Daf 89b

<b>we require</b> a minimum <b>measure</b> in order to fulfill these mitzvot. A shofar must be large enough that, when grasped, part of it protrudes from both sides of one’s hand, and a <i>lulav</i> must be at least four handbreadths long. <b>And</b> since an object of <b>idol worship</b> and its effects must be burned, <b>its size</b> as required for the mitzva <b>is seen</b> by <i>halakha</i> <b>as crushed</b> into powder. Since a <i>shofar</i> or <i>lulav</i> of idol worship is destined for burning, it is considered as if it is already burned, and it therefore lacks the requisite measurement for fulfilling the mitzva. By contrast, <b>here,</b> with regard to the ashes used to perform the mitzva of covering the blood, no minimum measure is required to fulfill the mitzva; in fact, <b>the more</b> the ash <b>is crushed, the better it is for</b> the mitzva of <b>covering</b> the blood.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The prohibition of eating <b>the sciatic nerve applies</b> both <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>in the presence of,</b> i.e., the time of, <b>the Temple and not in the presence of the Temple,</b> and <b>with regard to non-sacred</b> animals <b>and with regard to sacrificial</b> animals. <b>And it applies to domesticated animals and to undomesticated animals, to</b> the <b>thigh of the right</b> leg <b>and to</b> the <b>thigh of the left</b> leg. <b>But it does not apply to a bird, due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the verse makes reference to the sciatic nerve as being “upon the spoon of the thigh” (Genesis 32:33), and a bird <b>has no spoon</b> of the thigh.
And the prohibition <b>applies to</b> a late-term animal <b>fetus [<i>shalil</i>]</b> in the womb. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It does not apply to a fetus; and</b> similarly, <b>its fat is permitted.</b>
<b>And butchers are not deemed credible</b> to say that <b>the sciatic nerve</b> was removed; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: They are deemed credible about</b> the sciatic nerve <b>and about the</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve applies to both non-sacred animals and sacrificial animals. The Gemara asks: Is it not <b>obvious</b> that the prohibition applies to <b>sacrificial</b> animals? Would it be reasonable to suggest that <b>because one consecrated it, he has abrogated the prohibition of</b> eating the sciatic <b>nerve from it?</b>
<b>And if you would say</b> that sciatic <b>nerves have</b> the ability to <b>impart flavor,</b> i.e., they possess flavor, <b>and</b> the mishna is teaching that <b>the prohibition of</b> eating meat of <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>comes and takes effect upon</b> the sciatic nerve despite the fact that it is already subject to the <b>prohibition of</b> eating the sciatic <b>nerve,</b> the mishna <b>should have</b> stated: The prohibition of eating meat of <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>applies to the</b> sciatic <b>nerve.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>holds</b> that the sciatic <b>nerve does not have</b> the ability to <b>impart flavor, and</b> the mishna is teaching that <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> animals <b>there is a prohibition</b> of eating the sciatic <b>nerve</b> but <b>there is no</b> additional <b>prohibition</b> of eating the meat of <b>a sacrificial</b> animal.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>And</b> does <b>the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>hold</b> that the sciatic <b>nerve does not have</b> the ability to <b>impart flavor? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (96b): In the case of <b>a thigh that was cooked</b> with <b>the sciatic nerve in it, if there is</b> enough of the sciatic nerve <b>in</b> the thigh to <b>impart</b> its <b>flavor</b> to the meat, the entire thigh <b>is forbidden?</b> Consequently, it is clear that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna holds that the sciatic nerve does possess flavor.
<b>Rather,</b> in the mishna <b>here we are dealing with offspring of sacrificial</b> animals. <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve <b>applies with regard to a fetus, and</b> he also <b>holds</b> that the <b>offspring of sacrificial</b> animals <b>are consecrated</b> even while they are <b>in the womb of their mother.</b> Consequently, the <b>prohibition of</b> eating the sciatic <b>nerve and the prohibition of</b> eating <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>come</b> into effect <b>at the same time,</b> and therefore both prohibitions apply and one does not say that a prohibition does not take effect where another prohibition already exists.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>Can you interpret</b> this clause of the mishna as referring <b>to a fetus? From</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches: It applies to</b> a late-term <b>fetus,</b> and Rabbi Yehuda holds that it does not apply to a late-term fetus, <b>it may be inferred that</b> in <b>the first</b> clause <b>we are not dealing with a fetus.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>is saying: This matter</b> that was taught in the first clause <b>is</b> a matter of <b>dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis.</b>
The Gemara again challenges the explanation that the first clause of the mishna is referring to a fetus: <b>And how can you say that both</b> prohibitions <b>come</b> into effect <b>at the same time? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 49b): <b>A nazirite shaves for</b> having become impure from <b>these</b> sources of <b>ritual impurity: For</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse and for</b> impurity imparted by <b>an olive-bulk of a corpse.</b>
<b>And</b> the clause: For impurity imparted by a corpse, is <b>difficult for us,</b> as it seems unnecessary; if a nazirite <b>must shave for</b> impurity imparted by <b>an olive-bulk of a corpse,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> true that he must shave <b>for</b> impurity imparted by <b>an entire</b> corpse? <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>necessary only for a miscarried</b> human <b>fetus whose limbs had not</b> yet <b>become joined to</b> its <b>sinews.</b> Since the spine is complete the fetus is considered a full corpse, but as the limbs have not yet joined to the sinews it does not contain an olive-bulk of flesh.

Daf 90a

<b>Evidently,</b> the limbs of the body are formed before the nerves and sinews, and therefore the <b>prohibition of</b> eating <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>precedes</b> the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve.
The Gemara answers: <b>Even though the prohibition of</b> eating <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>precedes</b> the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve, the <b>prohibition of</b> eating the sciatic <b>nerve comes and takes effect upon</b> the offspring of consecrated animals, <b>because</b> the <b>prohibition</b> of eating the sciatic nerve adds an extra stringency in that it <b>applies</b> also <b>to descendants of Noah.</b> The prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve was in effect from the time Jacob wrestled with the angel (see Genesis 32:25–33), before the Torah was given. At that time, Jacob and his sons had the status of descendants of Noah, i.e., gentiles. Therefore, the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve is broader than the prohibition of eating meat of sacrificial animals, which took effect only when the Torah was given.
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>Whom did you hear</b> holds in accordance with <b>this reasoning?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> cited in a later mishna (100b). <b>But the mishna</b> here <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it teaches</b> that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve <b>applies to domesticated animals and to undomesticated animals, to</b> the <b>thigh of the right</b> leg <b>and to</b> the <b>thigh of the left</b> leg. By contrast, Rabbi Yehuda holds that the prohibition applies only with regard to the sciatic nerve in the thigh of one leg (see 90b).
The Gemara explains: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> of <b>this</b> mishna <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda <b>with regard to one</b> <i>halakha</i>, i.e., that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve applies to the descendants of Noah, <b>and disagrees with his</b> opinion <b>with regard to one</b> <i>halakha</i> and holds that the prohibition applies to the sciatic nerves of both legs.
The Gemara challenges: <b>Say that you heard that Rabbi Yehuda</b> rules that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve takes effect in addition to the prohibition <b>with regard to a non-kosher</b> animal, <b>which is a prohibition</b> punishable by lashes. Since the prohibition of the sciatic nerve is broader in that it applies to the descendants of Noah, it takes effect even though the animal is already prohibited as being not kosher. But in the case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>whose</b> consumption by an impure person is <b>a prohibition</b> punishable by <b><i>karet</i>, did you hear</b> that Rabbi Yehuda considers the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve more stringent, such that it takes effect even though the animal is already prohibited? Therefore, this answer is rejected.
The Gemara offers an alternative answer: <b>Rather, here</b> in the mishna <b>we are dealing with</b> a non-sacred animal <b>giving birth to</b> its <b>firstborn, which</b> becomes <b>sanctified</b> as it leaves the <b>womb.</b> The mishna teaches that although the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve does not apply to the offspring of sacrificial animals, because their sacrificial status renders them prohibited for consumption before the prohibition of the sciatic nerve takes effect, that is not the case with regard to a firstborn. The sanctified status of a firstborn takes effect only as it leaves the womb, which is after the prohibition of the sciatic nerve takes effect.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the mishna is dealing with the <b>offspring of</b> all <b>sacrificial</b> animals, and this <i>tanna</i> holds that such animals <b>are sanctified</b> only <b>when they come into being</b> as independent creatures, i.e., at birth. Consequently, the prohibition of the sciatic nerve takes effect before the animal becomes prohibited at the time of its birth; or, according to the opinion that the sciatic nerve is permitted in a fetus, the two prohibitions take effect simultaneously.
§ Having addressed the need for the mishna to state that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve applies with regard to sacrificial animals, the Gemara discusses which types of sacrificial animals are included in this prohibition. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the prohibition of the sciatic nerve applies <b>only</b> with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>that are eaten,</b> e.g., sin offerings, guilt offerings and peace offerings; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>that are not eaten,</b> e.g., burnt offerings, <b>the prohibition</b> of the sciatic <b>nerve does not apply. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The prohibition</b> of the sciatic <b>nerve applies both</b> with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>that are eaten and</b> with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>that are not eaten.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>do not disagree;</b> they are merely referring to different cases. <b>Here,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan says that the prohibition of the sciatic nerve applies <b>with regard to flogging</b> one who eats it. <b>There,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says that the prohibition of the sciatic nerve does not apply <b>with regard to bringing</b> the meat of the animal <b>up</b> to the altar, i.e., offerings that are burned on the altar are brought up with the sciatic nerve. Burning the sciatic nerve on the altar is not comparable to eating it and is not prohibited.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Pappa said</b> as follows: Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>do not disagree;</b> they are merely referring to different cases. <b>Here,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says that the prohibition of the sciatic nerve does not apply to burnt offerings, in that one is not required <b>to remove it</b> before burning the offering on the altar. <b>There,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan says that he prohibition does apply, in that if one did remove the sciatic nerve, it is prohibited <b>to bring it up</b> onto the altar independently.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> disagreed with Rav Pappa and <b>said:</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagree</b> with regard to whether it is permitted <b>to bring up</b> the sciatic nerve to the altar even when it remains in the thigh. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the verse: <b>“And the priest shall make it all smoke on the altar”</b> (Leviticus 1:9), the term “it all” serves <b>to include the bones, and the sinews, and the horns, and the hooves</b> among those items burned on the altar.
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if <b>they became detached</b> from the flesh of the burnt offering they are burned upon the altar. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood,</b> upon the altar of the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 12:27), indicating that only the flesh and the blood are offered upon the altar.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> it is only <b>the flesh and the blood</b> that are offered on the altar, one <b>might</b> have thought that a priest must first <b>remove the sinews and bones</b> from an offering <b>and</b> only then may he <b>bring up the flesh</b> to be burned <b>upon the altar.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And the priest shall make it all smoke on the altar,”</b> including the sinews and bones. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? If the sinews and bones are <b>attached</b> to the flesh, <b>they shall ascend.</b> If they <b>became detached</b> from the flesh, then <b>even</b> if they are already <b>at the top of the altar, they shall descend.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And who is the <i>tanna</i> that you heard, who said</b> if <b>they became detached</b> from the flesh, <b>they shall descend? It is Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the verse that states: <b>“And the priest shall make it all smoke</b> on the altar,” the term “it all” serves <b>to include the bones, and the sinews, and the horns, and the hooves</b> among those items burned on the altar, <b>and</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if <b>they became detached</b> from the flesh of the offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> if so, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood,</b> upon the altar of the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 12:27), which indicates that only the flesh and blood of an offering are offered on the altar? It is referring <b>to</b> parts of the offering that become <b>dislodged</b> from the fire. <b>How so?</b> If the partially <b>consumed flesh</b> of a burnt offering is dislodged from the altar, <b>you return</b> it to the fire, <b>but you do not return</b> the partially <b>consumed sinews and bones</b> that become dislodged.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that <b>one verse states: “And the priest shall make it all smoke</b> on the altar,” which <b>included</b> sinews and bones. <b>And one verse states: “And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood,”</b> which <b>excluded</b> any part other than the flesh and the blood. <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? If the sinews and bones were <b>attached</b> to the flesh, <b>they shall ascend.</b> If they <b>became detached</b> from the flesh, then <b>even</b> if they are already <b>on top of the altar, they shall descend.</b>
The Gemara explains their dispute: <b>And the Rabbis</b> hold that with regard to sinews and bones that <b>are attached</b> to the flesh it <b>was not necessary</b> for <b>a verse to include</b> the obligation to bring them up to the altar. It is clear that they must be brought up, <b>just as it is</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the head of a burnt offering,</b> which contains many bones, is brought up, as stated explicitly in the verse: “And Aaron’s sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, and the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire that is upon the altar” (Leviticus 1:8). <b>When a verse was necessary</b> it was <b>for</b> the case where the sinews and bones <b>became detached</b> from the flesh. Consequently, when the verse uses the inclusive phrase “it all,” it is to include sinews and bones that became detached.
<b>But Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi holds that with regard to sinews and bones that are <b>attached</b> to the flesh and <b>that are permitted</b> to be eaten,

Daf 90b

<b>it was not necessary</b> for <b>the verse to include</b> them. <b>When</b> a verse <b>was necessary</b> it was <b>for the sciatic nerve that</b> is still <b>attached</b> to the flesh. The term “it all” teaches that if the sciatic nerve is attached to the flesh it is brought up to the altar.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> would explain their opinion based upon the verse: “And one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, <b>from the well-watered pastures [<i>mimashke</i>] of Israel;</b> for a meal offering, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them, says the Lord God” (Ezekiel 45:15). Since the term <i>mashke</i> also means beverage, which is consumed, the verse is interpreted to mean that offerings may be sacrificed only <b>from that which is permitted to the Jewish people</b> for consumption. Since the sciatic nerve is not permitted for consumption, it may not be sacrificed on the altar. Consequently, the term “it all” is understood to include sinews and bones even if they have become detached from the flesh.
<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi would respond that a sciatic nerve that is attached to the flesh may be brought up to the altar, <b>just as it is</b> permitted to sacrifice forbidden <b>fat and blood</b> upon the altar even though they are forbidden for consumption. <b>And the Rabbis</b> would say that forbidden fat and blood <b>are different,</b> because the Torah explicitly states that <b>their mitzva is</b> to be offered on the altar <b>in this</b> way, whereas the Torah never mandates the sacrifice of the sciatic nerve upon the altar. According to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef agrees with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi that the sciatic nerve is offered upon the altar together with the rest of the animal, whereas Rabbi Yoḥanan holds in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis that the sciatic nerve is not offered upon the altar.
§ The Gemara cites another discussion with regard to the sciatic nerve of a burnt offering. <b>Rav Huna says: The sciatic nerve of a burnt offering</b> is not placed upon the altar with the rest of the animal. Rather, <b>one removes it</b> and places it <b>on the</b> circular <b>mound</b> of ashes in the center of the altar. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Master of this [<i>mari dikhi</i>]</b> ruling! <b>Is it written</b> in the Torah: <b>Therefore the altar does not consume</b> the sciatic nerve? This would indicate that it is prohibited to sacrifice the sciatic nerve on the altar. Rather, it <b>is written: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not</b> the sciatic nerve” (Genesis 32:33).
<b>And Rav Huna</b> holds that the phrase: <b>“From the well-watered pastures of Israel,”</b> indicates that offerings may be sacrificed only <b>from that which is permitted to the Jewish people.</b> Since the sciatic nerve is not permitted for consumption, it may not be sacrificed upon the altar.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Huna’s opinion. It is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: What should one do with <b>the sciatic nerve of a peace offering,</b> since the meat of the offering must be eaten but the sciatic nerve is forbidden? <b>One sweeps it to the</b> Temple courtyard <b>drain. And</b> in the case of the sciatic nerve <b>of a burnt offering, one brings it up</b> to the altar. The Gemara comments: <b>What, is it not</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means that <b>he brings it up</b> to the altar <b>and burns it</b> with the rest of the animal, which contradicts the statement of Rav Huna?
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that <b>he brings it up</b> to the altar <b>and removes it</b> from the thigh before placing the thigh on the fire. The Gemara asks: <b>But since he removes it</b> from the thigh, <b>why does he bring it up</b> to the altar? The Gemara answers that one cannot bring the thigh up to the altar after the sciatic nerve has been removed <b>because it is stated</b> with regard to one who sacrifices offerings that are damaged or unattractive: <b>“Present it now unto your governor;</b> will he be pleased with you, or will he accept your person? says the Lord of hosts” (Malachi 1:8). Consequently, the leg of the animal must be brought up to the altar while it is whole, and the sciatic nerve must be removed on top of the altar.
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna:</b> With regard to the <b>sciatic nerve of a peace offering, one sweeps it into the</b> Temple courtyard <b>drain; and</b> with regard to the sciatic nerve <b>of a burnt offering, one removes it</b> and places it <b>on the</b> circular <b>mound</b> of ashes in the center of the altar.
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Tamid</i> 28b): <b>There was</b> a circular <b>mound</b> of ashes <b>in the center of the altar,</b> and <b>sometimes there was</b> as much <b>as three hundred <i>kor</i></b> of ashes <b>upon it. Rava said:</b> This description is <b>an exaggeration [<i>guzma</i>];</b> the <i>tanna</i> means merely that there was a significant quantity of ashes.
Similarly, it is taught in a mishna (<i>Tamid</i> 30a) that before slaughtering the daily offering the priests <b>gave</b> the lamb selected for <b>the daily offering</b> water <b>to drink in a golden cup,</b> in order to render the animal easier to flay after slaughter. With regard to this mishna, <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>an exaggeration,</b> as the priests did not actually let the animal drink from a golden vessel.
The Gemara provides other examples of statements not meant literally. <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> In some instances, <b>the Torah spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated [<i>havai</i>] language, the Prophets spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated language,</b> and <b>the Sages spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated language.</b> The fact that <b>the Sages spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated language</b> is evident from <b>that which we stated above,</b> concerning the mound of ashes and the lamb of the daily offering.
<b>The Torah spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated language,</b> as it is written: “Hear, Israel: You are passing over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than you, <b>cities great and fortified up to heaven”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:1), whereas the fortifications obviously did not actually reach up to heaven. <b>The Prophets spoke</b> employing <b>exaggerated language,</b> as it is written with regard to the coronation of King Solomon: “And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, <b>so that the earth rent with the sound of them”</b> (I Kings 1:40), where the verse means merely that the sound was very loud.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: In three places the Sages spoke</b> in <b>exaggerated language, and they are</b> with regard to the circular <b>mound</b> of ashes on the altar; the <b>vine; and</b> the <b>Curtain</b> separating the Sanctuary and Holy of Holies. The case of the circular <b>mound</b> of ashes <b>is that which we said.</b>
The case of the <b>vine</b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Middot</i> 36a): <b>A golden</b> ornament in the form of <b>a vine was standing at the entrance to the Sanctuary,</b> and it was <b>hung upon poles. And whoever would donate</b> an ornamental golden leaf, <b>grape, or cluster</b> of grapes to the Temple would <b>bring</b> it to the Temple <b>and hang</b> it <b>upon</b> the vine. <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, said: There was</b> once <b>an incident, and three hundred priests were enlisted to move</b> the vine because of its immense weight. According to Shmuel, this description is also an exaggeration.
The case of the <b>Curtain</b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 8:2): <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, the deputy</b> High Priest: The <b>Curtain</b> is the <b>thickness of a handbreadth [<i>tefaḥ</i>]. It is woven from seventy-two strands [<i>nirim</i>]</b> of yarn, <b>and each and every strand [<i>nima</i>]</b> of those seventy-two is made from <b>twenty-four threads</b> consisting of six threads each of sky-blue wool, purple wool, scarlet wool, and fine linen. <b>Its length</b> is <b>forty cubits,</b> the height of the Sanctuary, <b>and its width</b> is <b>twenty cubits,</b> the width of the entrance. <b>And</b> it <b>is made from eighty-two ten-thousands,</b> i.e., 820,000 dinars. <b>And</b> the overseers of the Temple <b>make two</b> new Curtains every <b>year. And</b> the Curtain was so heavy that when it was immersed, <b>three hundred priests would immerse it.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that the prohibition of the sciatic nerve applies <b>to</b> the <b>thigh of the right</b> leg <b>and to</b> the <b>thigh of the left</b> leg. The Gemara says: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The prohibition of the sciatic nerve <b>applies only to</b> the sciatic nerve <b>in one</b> of the animal’s thighs, <b>and logic dictates</b> that it is <b>the right</b> thigh.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is it <b>obvious to Rabbi Yehuda</b> that the prohibition applies only to the sciatic nerve in the right thigh, <b>and</b> accordingly, <b>what</b> does he mean when he says that <b>logic</b> dictates? He means <b>the logic of the Torah. Or perhaps he is uncertain</b> as to whether it applies only to the right thigh or only to the left, <b>and</b> accordingly, <b>what</b> does he mean when he says that <b>logic</b> dictates? He means that <b>logic inclines</b> one to believe that the prohibition applies to the right thigh.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution based upon the following mishna (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 83a): <b>The bones</b> of the Paschal offering that contain edible marrow but cannot be eaten because it is prohibited to break the bones of the Paschal offering; <b>and the sinews; and the leftover</b> meat <b>should</b> all <b>be burned on the sixteenth</b> of Nisan, not on the fifteenth, the first day of Passover. <b>And we discussed it: What are the circumstances</b> in which <b>these sinews</b> must be burned? <b>If we say</b> they are <b>sinews of meat, let one eat them.</b> Why are they burned? <b>And if</b> they are sinews <b>that were left over</b> and not eaten, <b>that is</b> the case of <b>leftover</b> meat; why does the mishna list sinews separately? <b>Rather,</b> the mishna is referring to <b>sinews of the neck,</b> which are different from other sinews and are therefore mentioned separately. But <b>if they are not meat,</b> why do they require burning? <b>Let one</b> simply <b>discard them</b> like other waste.
<b>And Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The mishna’s mention of sinews <b>is necessary only</b> in order to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>of the sciatic nerve,</b> and <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, who said:</b> The prohibition of the sciatic nerve <b>applies only to</b> the sciatic nerve in <b>one</b> of the animal’s thighs, and not to both.
The Gemara explains how this resolves the dilemma: <b>Granted if you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>is uncertain</b> as to whether it is the sciatic nerve of the right or the left thigh, it works out <b>well.</b> Since it is uncertain which thigh may be eaten, one may not eat either of them, and one must burn each of them on the sixteenth due to the possibility that it was the permitted one and now has the status of leftover meat. <b>But if you say</b> that it is <b>obvious to</b> Rabbi Yehuda that the sciatic nerve of only the right thigh is forbidden, <b>let him eat</b> the sciatic nerve <b>of the permitted</b> left thigh, and <b>let him throw</b> away only the sciatic nerve <b>of the forbidden</b> right thigh. Neither one should be burned.
The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Ika bar Ḥanina said: Actually I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that it is <b>obvious to</b> Rabbi Yehuda that the sciatic nerve of only the right thigh is forbidden. Nevertheless, <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the sciatic nerves <b>were identified</b> and removed, <b>but ultimately</b> the sciatic nerves <b>became intermingled</b> and one cannot tell which is from the right thigh and which is from the left thigh. Consequently, they must both be left over until the next day and then burned.

Daf 91a

<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The mishna’s ruling that the sinews must be burned <b>is necessary only</b> with regard to the <b>fat</b> around the sciatic nerve, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>fat</b> around the sciatic nerve <b>is permitted</b> by Torah law, <b>but the Jewish people are holy</b> and <b>treated it as forbidden.</b> Since it is permitted by Torah law, it has the status of sacrificial meat and may not be simply discarded. Nevertheless, since the Jewish people treat it as forbidden, they do not eat it even from the Paschal offering, despite the mitzva to eat that offering in its entirety. Therefore, it is left until after the time when the meat may be eaten and it is burned as leftover sacrificial meat.
<b>Ravina said:</b> The mishna’s statement <b>is necessary only</b> with regard to the outer nerve, and it is <b>in accordance with that which Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Shmuel said. As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: There are two nerves</b> included in the prohibition of the sciatic nerve. The <b>inner</b> nerve that is <b>next to the bone is forbidden</b> by Torah law, <b>and one is liable</b> to be flogged <b>for</b> eating <b>it.</b> The <b>outer</b> nerve that is <b>next to the flesh is forbidden</b> by rabbinic law, <b>and</b> therefore <b>one is not liable</b> to be flogged <b>for</b> eating <b>it.</b> In the case of a Paschal offering, since the outer nerve is permitted by Torah law, it assumes the status of leftover sacrificial meat when it is not eaten.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another resolution to the dilemma about Rabbi Yehuda’s statement, from a mishna (96a): If <b>one ate an olive-bulk from this</b> sciatic nerve of the right leg <b>and an olive-bulk from that</b> sciatic nerve of the left leg, <b>he incurs eighty</b> lashes. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He incurs only forty</b> lashes.
<b>Granted, if you say</b> it is <b>obvious to</b> Rabbi Yehuda that the sciatic nerve of the right thigh is the one forbidden by Torah law, it is <b>well. But if you say he is uncertain,</b> why would he hold that one incurs any lashes? When the individual is forewarned not to partake of each sciatic nerve, which is necessary in order to be liable for incurring lashes, <b>it is an uncertain forewarning, and we have heard</b> about <b>Rabbi Yehuda that he said: An uncertain forewarning is not characterized as forewarning.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one is uncertain which of two men is his father and he <b>struck this</b> one <b>and then struck that</b> one, or <b>cursed this</b> one <b>and then cursed that</b> one, or <b>struck both of them simultaneously, or cursed both of them simultaneously, he is liable</b> to receive the death penalty, as he certainly struck or cursed his father. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he struck or cursed both of them <b>simultaneously he is liable,</b> provided he was forewarned that his action will certainly render him liable to receive the death penalty. But if he struck or cursed them <b>one after the other he is exempt.</b> Apparently, Rabbi Yehuda is of the opinion that one is not punished after uncertain forewarning; since in this case it is impossible to determine which of them is the father, inevitably each forewarning is uncertain. Similarly, if Rabbi Yehuda is uncertain which sciatic nerve is forbidden by Torah law, he should hold that since the forewarning before eating either sciatic nerve is uncertain, one who consumes both should be exempt.
The Gemara answers: <b>This <i>tanna</i></b> of that mishna, on 96a, <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>another <i>tanna</i></b> with regard to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that Rabbi Yehuda holds that <b>an uncertain forewarning is characterized as forewarning.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“And you shall not leave any of it until morning;</b> but that which remains of it until morning you shall burn with fire” (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to provide a positive mitzva</b> to burn the leftover meat <b>after</b> it has taught <b>a prohibition</b> against leaving it over, <b>to say that one is not flogged for</b> violation <b>of</b> the prohibition; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Rabbi Yehuda holds that one is not flogged for any transgression that can be rectified by the performance of a positive mitzva.
<b>Rabbi Ya’akov says: This,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that one is not flogged, <b>is not for</b> that <b>reason. Rather,</b> it is <b>because</b> leaving over sacrificial meat <b>is a prohibition that does not involve an action,</b> as one violates the prohibition through failure to take action, <b>and</b> concerning <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action, one is not flogged for</b> its violation. The forewarning one could receive for this transgression is an uncertain one, because witnesses who forewarn the individual cannot be certain until daybreak that he will leave it over. Nevertheless, this <i>baraita</i> indicates that if not for the fact that leaving over sacrificial meat can be rectified by a positive mitzva, Rabbi Yehuda would hold that one is flogged for leaving over sacrificial meat.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of the uncertainty with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one ate two</b> sciatic <b>nerves from two thighs of two</b> different <b>animals, he incurs eighty</b> lashes. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He incurs only forty</b> lashes.
The Gemara comments: <b>From</b> the fact that the first <i>tanna</i> <b>said</b> that he was referring to <b>two thighs of two</b> different <b>animals,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that he meant they were both from the right thigh, because if one were from the right thigh and one were from the left thigh it would not matter if they were from two different animals or from the same animal. Consequently, <b>both</b> sciatic nerves are definitely <b>forbidden</b> by Torah law, and according to the first <i>tanna</i> one incurs eighty lashes for eating them. <b>And</b> it <b>was necessary</b> to teach that <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda</b> one incurs only forty lashes, as will be explained. <b>Conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>obvious to</b> Rabbi Yehuda that it is the sciatic nerve of the right thigh that is forbidden by Torah law. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> it that this is Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion.
The Gemara seeks to clarify the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But if it</b> is <b>obvious to</b> Rabbi Yehuda that the sciatic nerve from the right thigh is prohibited by Torah law, <b>why</b> does he <b>incur forty</b> lashes <b>and nothing more? Let him be flogged eighty</b> times. The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the volume of one of the sciatic nerves <b>is not an olive-bulk,</b> and Rabbi Yehuda holds that in such a case one is not flogged for its consumption. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one ate</b> the entire sciatic nerve <b>and</b> its volume <b>is not an olive-bulk,</b> he is nevertheless <b>liable</b> to be flogged, because he ate a complete, natural unit of forbidden food. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He is not liable <b>unless it has</b> a volume of at least <b>an olive-bulk.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that Rabbi Yehuda holds that only the sciatic nerve of the right thigh is forbidden by Torah law? <b>Rava said</b> that it is because the <b>verse states:</b> “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve that is upon the spoon of <b>the thigh”</b> (Genesis 32:33). The definite article indicates that this is referring to <b>the most important thigh.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis,</b> who hold that the sciatic nerves of both the right and left thighs are forbidden by Torah law, explain the definite article as teaching that the prohibition applies to <b>the one whose prohibition spreads through the entire thigh,</b> i.e., the inner nerve. This serves <b>to exclude</b> the <b>outer</b> nerve, <b>which is not</b> prohibited by Torah law.
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said</b> that Rabbi Yehuda holds that the sciatic nerve of the right thigh is forbidden because <b>the verse states:</b> “And when he saw that he could not prevail against him, he touched the spoon of his thigh; and the spoon of Jacob’s thigh was strained, <b>as he wrestled with him”</b> (Genesis 32:26). The angel grappled with Jacob <b>like a man who hugs another</b> in order to throw him to the ground, <b>and his hand reaches to the spoon of the right</b> thigh <b>of the other.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> The angel <b>appeared to him as a gentile, as the Master said: A Jew who is joined by a gentile on the road</b> and continues his travels with him should <b>position</b> the gentile <b>to his right,</b> close to one’s dominant hand. This allows the Jew to defend himself against any potential attack. Since Jacob followed this practice, it was therefore Jacob’s right thigh that the angel touched.
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa said before Rav Pappa in the name of Rava bar Ulla</b> that the angel <b>appeared to</b> Jacob <b>as a Torah scholar,</b> and therefore Jacob positioned the angel on his right side, <b>as the Master said: One who walks to the right of his teacher is an ignoramus,</b> in that he does not know how to act with good manners. Consequently, it was Jacob’s right thigh that the angel touched.
<b>And the Rabbis,</b> who hold that the sciatic nerves of both thighs are forbidden, understand that the angel <b>came from behind</b> Jacob <b>and hit him on both</b> thighs.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis, what do they derive</b> from <b>this</b> phrase: <b>“As he wrestled with him”</b> (Genesis 32:26)? The Gemara answers: They <b>require it for the other</b> interpretation <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> This <b>teaches that the dust [<i>avak</i>] from their feet ascended to the throne of glory. It is written here: “As he wrestled [<i>behe’avko</i>] with him,” and it is written there</b> in a description of how God will punish the wicked: “The Lord, in the whirlwind and in the storm is His way, <b>and the clouds are the dust of His feet”</b> (Nahum 1:3).
§ The Gemara cites another statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi concerning the sciatic nerve: <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Why is its name called sciatic nerve [<i>gid hanashe</i>]?</b> It is <b>because</b> the sciatic nerve <b>left [<i>nasha</i>] its place and rose. And similarly</b> the verse <b>says:</b> “The mighty men of Babylon have ceased to fight, they remain in their strongholds; <b>their might has left [<i>nashata</i>], they are become as women”</b> (Jeremiah 51:30).
The Gemara continues with other expositions pertaining to the sciatic nerve. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “The Lord <b>sent a word to Jacob, and it has fallen upon Israel”</b> (Isaiah 9:7)? <b>“He sent a word to Jacob”; this</b> is a reference to <b>the sciatic nerve. “And it has fallen upon Israel”;</b> this teaches <b>that its prohibition has</b> been <b>extended to the entire Jewish people.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> also <b>said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house: Bring the men into the house, <b>and slaughter the animals, and prepare</b> the meat; for the men shall dine with me at noon” (Genesis 43:16)? Joseph commanded his steward: <b>Expose the place of the slaughter</b> on the neck of the animal <b>to them</b> so that the brothers will know that it is being slaughtered correctly. <b>“And prepare”</b> teaches that Joseph instructed the steward to <b>remove the sciatic nerve in their presence</b> so that the brothers would know that it had been fully removed. The Gemara comments that this opinion is <b>according to the one who said</b> that <b>the sciatic nerve was forbidden to</b> the children of Jacob even before the Torah was given, when they still had the status of <b>descendants of Noah.</b>
The Gemara returns to the verse of Jacob wrestling with the angel. The verse states: <b>“And Jacob was left alone;</b> and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day” (Genesis 32:25). <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The reason Jacob remained alone was <b>that he remained</b> to collect some <b>small pitchers</b> that had been left behind. <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that the possessions of the righteous are dearer to them than their bodies. And why</b> do they care <b>so much</b> about their possessions? It is <b>because they do not stretch out their hands to</b> partake of <b>stolen property.</b>
The verse states: <b>“And a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.” Rabbi Yitzḥak says: From here</b> it is derived <b>that a Torah scholar should not go out</b> of his house <b>alone at night,</b> as Jacob went out alone at night and was injured. <b>Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said</b> that the source for this instruction is <b>from here:</b>

Daf 91b

“And now is there not Boaz our kinsman, whose maidens you were with? <b>Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor</b>…and it shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place where he shall lie” (Ruth 3:2–3). This teaches that the reason Boaz did not return home from the threshing floor was that a Torah scholar should not go out alone at night.
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that the source is <b>from here: “And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled</b> his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went to the place that God had told him” (Genesis 22:3). The fact that Abraham waited until morning and did not set off at night, even though others were traveling with him, indicates that a Torah scholar should not go out at night at all, and certainly not alone.
<b>And the Rabbis say</b> that the source is <b>from here,</b> the verse that describes when Jacob sent Joseph to his brothers: “And he said to him: <b>Go now, see whether it is well with you brothers and well</b> with the flock; and bring me back word. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem” (Genesis 37:14). The verse indicates that Jacob sent Joseph at a time when he could see his brothers, i.e., during the day. This shows that a Torah scholar should not go out alone at night.
<b>Rav said</b> that the source is <b>from here: “And the sun rose for him</b> as he passed over Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh” (Genesis 32:32). This indicates that Jacob remained where he was all night and left in the morning, because a Torah scholar should not go out alone at night.
The Gemara cites an incident involving the final verse cited above. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: I asked</b> the following question of <b>Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Yehoshua in the meat market [<i>be’itliz</i>] of</b> the town <b>Emmaus, where they went to purchase an animal for the</b> wedding <b>feast of Rabban Gamliel’s son: It is written</b> in the verse: <b>“And the sun shone for him</b> when he passed Peniel, and he limped upon his thigh” (Genesis 32:32). <b>But did the sun shine only for him? Didn’t it shine for the entire world?</b>
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> The verse means that <b>the sun, which set</b> early exclusively <b>for him,</b> also <b>shone</b> early exclusively <b>for him</b> in order to rectify the disparity created by the premature sunset. The Gemara explains when the sun set early for him: <b>As it is written: “And Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran”</b> (Genesis 28:10). <b>And it is written</b> thereafter: <b>“And he encountered the place,</b> and he slept there, because the sun had set” (Genesis 28:11). <b>When</b> Jacob <b>arrived at Haran, he said:</b> Is it <b>possible</b> that <b>I passed a place where my fathers prayed and I did not pray</b> there? <b>When he set his mind to return, the land contracted for him. Immediately</b> the verse states: <b>“And he encountered the place,”</b> indicating that he arrived there miraculously.
<b>When he</b> had finished <b>praying</b> and <b>he wanted to return</b> to Haran, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: This righteous man came to my lodging place and he will depart without remaining overnight? Immediately, the sun set</b> before its proper time so that Jacob would stay overnight in that place.
The Gemara cites another exposition of Rabbi Yitzḥak to explain an apparent contradiction between two verses pertaining to this incident. <b>It is written: “And he took of the stones of the place,</b> and placed them under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep” (Genesis 28:11). <b>And it is written:</b> “And Jacob rose up early in the morning, <b>and he took the stone</b> that he had placed under his head, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it” (Genesis 28:18). The first verse indicates that Jacob took several stones, whereas the latter verse indicates that he took only one stone. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> This <b>teaches that all those stones gathered to one place and each one said:</b> Let <b>this righteous man place his head upon me.</b> And it was <b>taught: And all of them were absorbed into one</b> large rock.
The Gemara expounds other verses pertaining to the same incident. The verse states: <b>“And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth,</b> and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it” (Genesis 28:12). It was <b>taught: How wide was the ladder?</b> It was <b>eight thousand parasangs [<i>parsaot</i>], as it is written: “And behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.”</b> The word <b>“ascending [<i>olim</i>],”</b> written in plural, indicates that there were <b>two</b> angels ascending simultaneously. Likewise, the term <b>“and descending [<i>veyordim</i>],”</b> also in the plural, indicates that <b>two</b> angels were descending simultaneously. <b>And when they met one another they were</b> a total of <b>four</b> in one place, so the ladder must have been wide enough to accommodate four angels.
<b>And it is written</b> in a verse <b>with regard to an angel: “His body was like Tarshish”</b> (Daniel 10:6). <b>And</b> it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that</b> the city of <b>Tarshish was two thousand parasangs.</b> Consequently, in order to accommodate four angels, the ladder must have been eight thousands parasangs wide.
It was <b>taught</b> that the angels were <b>ascending and gazing at the image of [<i>bidyokeno</i>]</b> Jacob <b>above,</b> engraved on the Throne of Glory, <b>and descending and gazing at his image below.</b> The angels subsequently became jealous of Jacob, and <b>wanted to endanger</b> his life. <b>Immediately</b> Jacob received divine protection, as the verse states: <b>“And behold, the Lord stood over him”</b> (Genesis 28:13). <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: Were it not written</b> in a <b>verse it would be impossible to utter it,</b> in deference to God, since it describes God as standing over Jacob to protect him from the angels <b>like a man who waves</b> a fan <b>over his son</b> to cool him down.
The Gemara explains another verse from Jacob’s dream. “And behold, the Lord stood over him and said: I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. <b>The land upon which you lie,</b> to you will I give it, and to your seed” (Genesis 28:13). The Gemara asks: <b>What is the greatness</b> of this promise, i.e., why is it expressed in this way despite the fact that in a literal sense Jacob was lying on a very small amount of land? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, folded</b> up <b>the entirety of Eretz Yisrael and placed it under Jacob, our patriarch, so that it would be easy for his children to conquer.</b>
The Gemara returns to the verses that describe Jacob wrestling with the angel. <b>“And he said: Let me go, for the dawn has risen.</b> And he said: I will not let you go until you bless me” (Genesis 32:27). Jacob <b>said to</b> the angel: <b>Are you a thief, or are you a gambler [<i>kuveyustus</i>], who is afraid of dawn?</b> The angel <b>said to him: I am an angel, and from the day I was created my time to recite a song</b> before God <b>has not arrived, until now.</b> Now I must ascend so that I can sing songs of praise to God.
The Gemara comments: This <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥananel</b> when he related what <b>Rav said. As Rav Ḥananel said</b> that <b>Rav said: Three groups of ministering angels recite a song every day</b> from the verse “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord”; <b>one says: “Holy,” and</b> another <b>one says: “Holy,” and</b> another <b>one says: “Holy is the Lord of hosts;</b> the whole earth is full of His glory” (Isaiah 6:3).
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Jewish people are more dear to the Holy One, Blessed be He, than the ministering angels, as the Jewish people</b> may <b>recite a song</b> of praise to God <b>at any time, but ministering angels recite a song</b> of praise <b>only one time per day. And some say</b> that the ministering angels recite a song of praise <b>one time per week. And some say</b> that they recite a song of praise <b>one time per month. And some say</b> that they recite a song of praise <b>one time per year. And some say</b> that they recite a song of praise <b>one time in</b> every <b>seven years. And some say</b> that they recite a song of praise <b>one time per Jubilee. And some say</b> that they recite a song of praise <b>one time in</b> the entire history of <b>the world.</b>
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>the Jewish people mention the name</b> of God <b>after two words, as it is stated: “Hear, Israel: The Lord</b> our God, the Lord is one” (Deuteronomy 6:4). <b>But the ministering angels mention the name</b> of God <b>only after three words, as it is written:</b> “And one called unto another, and said: <b>“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;</b> the whole earth is full of His glory” (Isaiah 6:3).
<b>And the ministering angels do not recite</b> their <b>song above until the Jewish people recite</b> their song <b>below,</b> on earth, <b>as it is stated: “When the morning stars sang together”</b> (Job 38:7), referring to the Jewish people, who are compared to stars; <b>and</b> only <b>then</b> does the verse state: <b>“And all the sons of God shouted for joy,”</b> which is a reference to the angels. This <i>baraita</i> teaches that the angels mention the name of God only after three words, i.e., after saying the word “holy” three times, whereas according to what Rav Ḥananel stated that Rav said, the third group of angels says the word “holy” once and then immediately mentions the name of God.
The Gemara emends Rav Ḥananel’s statement citing Rav: <b>Rather,</b> Rav said that <b>one</b> group of ministering angels <b>says: “Holy,” and</b> another <b>one says: “Holy, holy,” and</b> another <b>one says: “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.”</b> The Gemara challenges the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that the angels mention the name of God only after three words: <b>But there is</b> the verse: “Then a spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing: <b>Blessed be</b> the glory of the Lord from His place” (Ezekiel 3:12). In this praise, “Blessed be the glory of the Lord,” the word “Lord” appears as the third Hebrew word, apparently uttered by the ministering angels.

Daf 92a

The Gemara answers that it is the <b><i>ofanim</i> who say</b> the verse: <b>“Blessed be</b> the glory of the Lord from His place,” as the next verse mentions “the noise of the <i>ofanim</i>” (Ezekiel 3:13), and Rav Ḥanina’s statement citing Rav was referring not to <i>ofanim</i> but to ministering angels. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>once permission has been given</b> to them to mention the name of God after three words when they say: “Holy, holy, holy,” permission is also <b>given</b> to them to mention the name of God again while praising Him even after fewer than three words.
The Gemara continues to discuss Jacob wrestling with the angel. The prophet states: <b>“So he strove [<i>vayyasar</i>] with an angel, and prevailed; he wept, and made supplication to him;</b> at Beth El he would find him, and there he would speak with us” (Hosea 12:5). From this verse <b>I do not know who became master [<i>sar</i>],</b> i.e., was victorious, <b>over whom. When</b> another verse <b>states:</b> “And he said: Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; <b>for you have striven with angels</b> and with men, and have prevailed” (Genesis 32:29), <b>you must say</b> that <b>Jacob became master over the angel.</b>
The verse in Hosea states: <b>“He wept, and made supplication to him.”</b> From this verse <b>I do not know who cried to whom. When</b> another verse <b>states: “And he said: Let me go,</b> for the dawn has risen” (Genesis 32:27), <b>you must say</b> that <b>the angel cried to Jacob.</b>
The verse states: “And he said: Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; <b>for you have striven with angels [<i>elohim</i>] and with men,</b> and have prevailed” (Genesis 32:29). <b>Rabba says:</b> The angel <b>intimated to</b> Jacob <b>that in the future two princes would emerge from him:</b> They are the <b>Exilarch who is in Babylonia and the <i>Nasi</i> who is in Eretz Yisrael.</b> And <b>from here he</b> also <b>intimated to</b> Jacob that there would be <b>an exile.</b>
Similarly, with regard to the dream of Pharaoh’s butler, the verse states: <b>“And in the vine were three branches [<i>sarigim</i>];</b> and as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth, and its clusters brought forth ripe grapes” (Genesis 40:10). <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav says: These</b> three branches refer to the <b>three proud princes [<i>sarei ge’im</i>] who emerge from the Jewish people in each and every generation.</b> There are <b>times</b> when <b>two are here</b> in Babylonia <b>and one is in Eretz Yisrael,</b> and there are <b>times</b> when <b>two are in Eretz Yisrael and one is here</b> in Babylonia. When this was stated in the study hall, <b>the Sages</b> present <b>turned their eyes toward Rabbana Ukva and Rabbana Neḥemya, the sons of the daughter of Rav,</b> who were from the family of the Exilarch and were two leaders of the generation who resided in Babylonia.
<b>Rava says</b> a different explanation of the verse: <b>These</b> three branches [<i>sarigim</i>] <b>are the three ministering</b> angels appointed to oversee <b>the gentiles [<i>sarei goyim</i>], who plead in favor of the Jewish people in each and every generation.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> an alternate interpretation of the verse. <b>“Vine”; this</b> is a reference to <b>the world. “Three branches”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. “And as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth”; these are the matriarchs. “And its clusters brought forth ripe grapes”; these are the</b> twelve <b>tribes,</b> i.e., the twelve sons of Jacob.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: But is a person shown</b> in a dream <b>what was</b> in the past? <b>Isn’t</b> it true that <b>one is shown only what will be in the future?</b> Since the patriarchs, matriarchs, and sons of Jacob were all born prior to this dream, the dream was not alluding to them. <b>Rather,</b> the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>“Vine”; this</b> is a reference to <b>the Torah. “Three branches”; these are Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. “And as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth”; these are the</b> members of the <b>Sanhedrin. “And its clusters brought forth ripe grapes”; these are the righteous</b> people <b>who</b> live <b>in each and every generation.</b>
<b>Rabban Gamliel said:</b> In order to understand this verse (Genesis 40:10) <b>we still need</b> the explanation <b>of</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>HaModa’i, who</b> is an expert in matters of <i>aggada</i>, as he <b>interprets all of</b> the phrases in the verse as referring to <b>one location. Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i says: “Vine”; this</b> is a reference to <b>Jerusalem. “Three branches”; this</b> is a reference to the <b>Temple,</b> the <b>king and</b> the <b>High Priest. “And as it was budding [<i>poraḥat</i>], its blossoms shot forth”; these are the young priests [<i>pirḥei khehunna</i>]. “And its clusters brought forth ripe grapes”; these are the</b> wine <b>libations.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi interprets it with</b> reference to the <b>gifts</b> that God gave the Jewish people, <b>as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: “Vine”; this</b> is a reference to the <b>Torah. “Three branches”; this</b> is a reference to the miraculous items that accompanied the Jewish people in the wilderness and sustained and protected them: The <b>well, the pillar of cloud, and the manna. “And as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth”; these are the first fruits</b> that are brought to the Temple. <b>“And its clusters brought forth ripe grapes”; these are</b> the wine <b>libations.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says: “Vine”; this</b> is a reference to <b>the Jewish people, and similarly</b> another verse <b>states: “You plucked up a vine out of Egypt;</b> You drove out the nations and planted it” (Psalms 80:9). <b>“Three branches”; these are the three</b> pilgrimage <b>Festivals, on which the Jewish people ascend</b> to Jerusalem <b>every year. “And as it was budding, its blossoms shot forth,”</b> means that <b>the time has arrived for the Jewish people to be fruitful and multiply, and similarly</b> another verse <b>states: “And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly,</b> and multiplied, and became exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them” (Exodus 1:7).
<b>“Its blossoms [<i>nitzah</i>] shot forth”</b> means that <b>the time has arrived for the Jewish people to be redeemed. And similarly</b> another verse <b>states: “And their eternity [<i>nitzḥam</i>] is dashed against My garments, and I have redeemed all My raiment”</b> (Isaiah 63:3). <b>“And its clusters brought forth ripe grapes”</b> means that <b>the time has arrived for Egypt to drink the cup of fury,</b> i.e., to receive its punishment.
<b>And this is as Rava said: Why</b> are there <b>three cups stated with regard to Egypt</b> in the dream of Pharaoh’s butler (see Genesis 40:11)? They are an allusion to three cups of misfortune that would later befall Egypt: <b>One that</b> Egypt <b>drank in the days of Moses</b> during the ten plagues and the Exodus; <b>one that</b> Egypt <b>drank in the days of Pharaoh Nekho,</b> the king of Egypt defeated by Nebuchadnezzar; <b>and one that</b> Egypt <b>will drink in the future with all the</b> other <b>nations,</b> when they are punished in the time of the Messiah.
<b>Rabbi Abba said to Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba: When Rav interpreted these verses homiletically he interpreted them according to</b> the way in which <b>you</b> have interpreted them, and not according to any of the other opinions cited above.
Similar to Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba’s interpretation of the word vine as an allusion to the Jewish people, <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: This nation is likened to a vine. The branches of</b> the vine support the clusters of grapes, the leaves, and the tendrils; <b>these are</b> represented among the Jewish people by <b>the homeowners,</b> who provide financial support for the entire nation. <b>The clusters</b> of grapes <b>on</b> the vine, <b>these are the Torah scholars. The leaves on</b> the vine, which protect the grapes, <b>these are the ignoramuses,</b> who protect the Torah scholars. <b>The tendrils of</b> the vine, which do not directly serve the grapes themselves, <b>these are the empty</b> ones <b>of the Jewish people.</b>
<b>And this is</b> the meaning of the instruction <b>that they sent from there,</b> i.e., from Eretz Yisrael: <b>Let the clusters</b> of grapes <b>pray for the leaves, as were it not for the leaves, the clusters</b> of grapes <b>would not survive.</b>
§ The Gemara cites homiletical interpretations of other verses that pertain to the leaders of the Jewish people in Eretz Yisrael and Babylonia. The verse states: <b>“So I bought her [<i>va’ekkereha</i>] to me for fifteen pieces of silver,</b> and a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley, and a half-<i>ḥomer</i> of barley” (Hosea 3:2). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak:</b> The term <b><i>kira</i>,</b> which forms the basis of the verb <i>va’ekkereha</i>, <b>is nothing other than language</b> referring to <b>a sale [<i>mekhira</i>], as it is stated</b> that Joseph said: “My father made me swear, saying: Lo, I die; <b>in my grave that I have acquired [<i>kariti</i>] for me</b> in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me” (Genesis 50:5).
Rabbi Yoḥanan continues: <b>“For fifteen</b> pieces of silver”; <b>this</b> is a reference to <b>the fifteenth of Nisan,</b> the date <b>on which the Jewish people were redeemed from Egypt. “Silver”; these are the righteous</b> people. <b>And similarly,</b> another verse <b>states: “He has taken the bag of silver with him”</b> (Proverbs 7:20), a reference to God taking the righteous away prior to the destruction of the First Temple (see <i>Sanhedrin</i> 96b).
The verse states: <b>“A <i>ḥomer</i> of barley, and a half-<i>ḥomer</i> of barley.”</b> A <i>ḥomer</i> equals thirty <i>se’a</i>, and a half-<i>ḥomer</i> equals fifteen <i>se’a</i>, totaling forty-five <i>se’a</i>; <b>these are the forty-five righteous</b> individuals <b>in whose</b> merit <b>the world</b> continues to <b>exist. And</b> although the verse alludes to the fact that thirty of these righteous individuals are in one place and fifteen are elsewhere, <b>I do not know if thirty are here</b> in Babylonia <b>and fifteen are in Eretz Yisrael, or if thirty are in Eretz Yisrael and fifteen are here</b> in Babylonia. <b>When it says</b> in a different verse: <b>“And I took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them into the treasury, in the house of the Lord”</b> (Zechariah 11:13), <b>you must say</b> that <b>thirty</b> of the righteous individuals are <b>in Eretz Yisrael and fifteen are here</b> in Babylonia.
<b>Abaye said: And most of the</b> fifteen righteous individuals in Babylonia <b>are found in the synagogue under the upper room. And this is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And I said to them: If it is good in your eyes, give me my hire; and if not, refrain. And they weighed for my hire thirty pieces of silver”</b> (Zechariah 11:12).
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says: These are the thirty righteous</b> individuals among the <b>nations of the world, in whose</b> merit <b>the nations of the world</b> continue to <b>exist. Ulla says: These are the thirty mitzvot that the descendants of Noah</b> initially <b>accepted upon themselves; but they fulfill only three</b> of them. <b>One</b> of these three mitzvot is

Daf 92b

<b>that they do not write a marriage contract for</b> a wedding between two <b>males;</b> although they violate the prohibition against engaging in homosexuality, they are not so brazen as to write a marriage contract as for a regular marriage. <b>And one</b> of the three mitzvot is <b>that</b> although they are suspected of eating human beings, <b>they do not weigh the flesh of the dead in butcher shops</b> [<b><i>bemakkulin</i></b>] and sell it publicly; <b>and one</b> is <b>that they honor the Torah.</b>
§ The mishna teaches (89b) that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve <b>does not apply to a bird</b> due to the fact that the verse is referring to the sciatic nerve as being “upon the spoon of the thigh” (Genesis 32:33), and a bird has no spoon of the thigh. The Gemara challenges: <b>But we see that it does have</b> a protrusion of flesh on its thigh. The Gemara answers: <b>It has</b> a protrusion, <b>but</b> that protrusion is <b>not rounded.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>a bird has</b> a protrusion on its thigh bone <b>and it is rounded,</b> or <b>an animal has</b> a protrusion on its thigh bone <b>but it is not rounded, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we follow it,</b> i.e., does the status of the sciatic nerve depend upon the physical properties of each particular animal, <b>or do we follow its species,</b> so that the sciatic nerve of an animal is always forbidden and that of a bird is always permitted? The Gemara responds: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna states that the prohibition of the sciatic nerve <b>applies to</b> a late-term animal <b>fetus</b> in the womb. Rabbi Yehuda says: It does not apply to a fetus; and its fat is permitted. <b>Shmuel says:</b> When the mishna states: <b>And its fat is permitted,</b> that is <b>according to everyone.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>The fat of what? If we say</b> that it is referring to the fat <b>of a fetus, don’t</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree about it, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The prohibition of the <b>sciatic nerve applies to</b> a late-term <b>fetus, and its fat is prohibited;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the prohibition of the <b>sciatic nerve does not apply to</b> a late-term <b>fetus, and its fat is permitted.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says</b> in explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: This <b>dispute</b> applies <b>to a nine-month-old,</b> i.e., a full-term, fetus that remains <b>alive</b> after its mother has been slaughtered. <b>And Rabbi Meir followed his</b> general <b>opinion</b> in this regard (see 74a), that this fetus is considered a live animal independent of its mother. Consequently, it must undergo ritual slaughter in order for its meat to be permitted for consumption, and its fats and sciatic nerve are forbidden like those of any other animal. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> followed <b>his</b> general <b>opinion</b> that such a fetus is not considered a live animal but rather part of its mother. Consequently, it does not require ritual slaughter, and its fats and sciatic nerve are permitted.
<b>But rather,</b> perhaps Shmuel’s statement was said with regard to <b>the fat of the</b> sciatic <b>nerve. But</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree</b> about this case as well, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the sciatic nerve, one scrapes around it</b> to remove it entirely <b>in any place that it is</b> found in the thigh, <b>and one cuts out its fat from its source,</b> i.e., even the fat that is embedded in the flesh; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: One cuts out</b> the nerve and fat so that they are level <b>with the flesh</b> [<b><i>hashufi</i></b>] of the thigh, but there is no need to scrape out the parts embedded in the flesh. Consequently, there is a dispute about the fat surrounding the sciatic nerve as well.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> Shmuel was referring to the <b>fat of the</b> sciatic <b>nerve,</b> and <b>Shmuel concedes that</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> the fat surrounding the sciatic nerve is <b>forbidden by rabbinic law</b> but permitted by Torah law. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Its fat is permitted</b> by Torah law, <b>but the Jewish people are holy</b> and <b>treated it as forbidden.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>What, is it not</b> that this <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said</b> that the fat is <b>permitted by Torah law but forbidden by rabbinic law?</b>
The Gemara challenges this: <b>From where</b> can it be proven that this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir? <b>Perhaps it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, but according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir it is even forbidden by Torah law.</b>
The Gemara rejects this challenge: It would <b>not enter your mind</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the sciatic nerve, one scrapes around it</b> to remove it entirely from <b>any place that it</b> is found in the thigh, <b>and its fat is permitted.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Whom have you heard who holds</b> that <b>scraping</b> is required? It is <b>Rabbi Meir. And</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>states</b> that <b>its fat is permitted.</b> Consequently, Rabbi Meir must hold that the fat surrounding the sciatic nerve is permitted by Torah law and forbidden by rabbinic law.
§ With regard to the sciatic nerve <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta says</b> that <b>Rav says: The Torah prohibited only its</b> thin, <b>tendril</b>-like nerve fibers <b>[<i>kenokanot</i>]</b> that branch off and run alongside the sciatic nerve, under the flesh. By contrast, the sciatic nerve itself, which is inedible and has no flavor, is therefore considered like wood rather than food, and is not forbidden. Conversely, <b>Ulla says:</b> The sciatic nerve <b>is</b> inedible and has no flavor, like <b>wood, but</b> nevertheless <b>the Torah rendered</b> one <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it.</b>
<b>Abaye said: It stands to reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Ulla, because Rav Sheshet said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said: The strands</b> of veins <b>that are in the</b> forbidden <b>fat are forbidden, but one is not liable for</b> eating <b>them. Apparently,</b> when <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that it is prohibited to eat <b>fat,</b> the prohibition applies only to the fat itself <b>but not</b> to <b>the strands</b> of veins. <b>Here also, the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that it is prohibited to eat the sciatic <b>nerve, but</b> that does <b>not</b> include <b>the tendril</b>-like nerve fibers.
§ The Gemara now returns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> cited in the discussion above: <b>Rav Sheshet said</b> that <b>Rav Asi said: The strands</b> of veins <b>that are in the</b> forbidden <b>fat are forbidden, but one is not liable for</b> eating <b>them.</b> The strands of veins <b>that are in the kidney are forbidden, but one is not liable for</b> eating <b>them.</b> With regard to the <b>white</b> fat of the <b>kidney,</b> there is a dispute between <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabbi Ḥiyya: One</b> of them <b>prohibits</b> its consumption, because it is similar to the fats that are prohibited by the Torah; <b>and one</b> of them <b>permits</b> eating it.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rabba</b> would <b>scrape</b> every remnant of white fat away from the kidney. Similarly, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> would <b>scrape it</b> away from the kidney. By contrast, <b>Rabbi Asi</b> would <b>cut it</b> from the surface of the kidney but would not scrape out the rest of it. <b>Abaye said: It stands to reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Asi, because Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b>

Daf 93a

The <b>fat that is covered by the flesh</b> is <b>permitted. Apparently,</b> when <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that the fat <b>that is upon the loins</b> is prohibited (see Leviticus 3:4), it is referring only to the fat above the loins <b>but not</b> the fat <b>that is inside the loins. Here also, the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that the fat <b>that is upon the kidneys</b> is prohibited (see Leviticus 3:4), <b>but</b> this does <b>not</b> include the fat <b>that is inside the kidneys.</b>
§ The Gemara addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> cited in the discussion above: <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The fat that is covered by the flesh</b> is <b>permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Abba say</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: This fat that is under the loins is forbidden,</b> even though it is covered by flesh?
The Gemara answers that <b>Abaye said: When an animal is alive</b> its limbs <b>separate</b> at the joints as it walks, so that the fat under the loins is not covered by flesh. Therefore, even after it has been slaughtered this fat is forbidden and does not have the status of fat that is covered by flesh. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I am not a butcher and I am not the son of a butcher,</b> i.e., I am not expert in the anatomy of animals, <b>but I remember that this is what they would say</b> in <b>the study hall: When an animal is alive</b> its limbs <b>separate</b> at the joints as it walks, so that the fat under the loins is exposed.
§ <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The fat that is on the omasum and the reticulum is forbidden, and</b> its consumption is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>. And this is the fat that is</b> referred to in the Torah as being <b>upon the innards</b> (see Leviticus 3:3). <b>Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: This fat of the coccygeal</b> bone <b>is forbidden, and</b> its consumption <b>is punishable by <i>karet</i>. And this is the fat that is</b> referred to in the Torah as being <b>upon the loins</b> (see Leviticus 3:4).
<b>And Rabbi Abba said</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: The veins that are in the foreleg</b> of an animal <b>are forbidden. Rav Safra said</b> to Rabbi Abba: <b>Moses! Did the Merciful One say</b> in the Torah: <b>Do not eat meat?</b> The veins of the foreleg are part of the meat and are not forbidden. <b>Rava said: Moses! Did the Merciful One say</b> in the Torah: <b>Eat blood?</b> The reason that these veins are forbidden is that they are filled with blood. Therefore, if one <b>cuts</b> the foreleg open <b>and salts it</b> to remove the blood, it is <b>permitted even</b> to cook it <b>in a pot;</b> and it is certainly permitted to roast it over a fire, which also draws out the blood.
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The fat on the <b>top cubit of the</b> small <b>intestine requires scraping,</b> i.e., it is forbidden and must be removed. <b>And this is</b> the fat referred to by the Sages (see 49b) as <b>the fat that is on the small intestine.</b>
<b>And Rav Yehuda says: The sinews that are in the tailbone are forbidden</b> for consumption, because they contain forbidden fat. <b>There are five sinews in the tail: Three on the right and two on the left.</b> The <b>three</b> on the right <b>each split into two,</b> and the <b>two</b> on the left <b>each split into three.</b> The practical <b>difference,</b> i.e., the reason the Gemara describes this in detail, is <b>that if</b> one <b>draws them out</b> while they are <b>still warm</b> soon after slaughter <b>they are drawn out</b> easily, <b>but if not,</b> he <b>is required to scrape around them,</b> i.e., dig into the flesh to remove them. It is important to know how many there are to ensure that one removes them all.
<b>Abaye said, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda</b> said: <b>There are five strands</b> that are forbidden for consumption; <b>three</b> of them are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>forbidden fat, and two</b> are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>blood.</b> The ligaments <b>of the spleen and of the tail and of the kidneys</b> are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>forbidden fat.</b> And the veins <b>of the foreleg and of the pharynx,</b> i.e., the carotid artery, are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>blood.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is</b> there whether they are forbidden due to fat or due to blood? The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>these</b> veins and arteries <b>that</b> are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>blood, if one cuts them</b> open <b>and</b> then <b>salts them</b> to remove the blood they are <b>permitted.</b> But <b>those</b> strands that contain forbidden fat <b>have no rectification</b> and can never be eaten.
<b>Rav Kahana said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Yehuda</b> who said: <b>There are five membranes</b> that are forbidden for consumption; <b>three</b> of them are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>forbidden fat, and two</b> are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>blood.</b> The membranes <b>of the spleen and of the tail and of the kidneys</b> are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>forbidden fat.</b> And the membranes <b>of the testicles and of the brain</b> are forbidden <b>because</b> they contain <b>blood.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Yehuda bar Oshaya was peeling</b> the membranes from <b>a spleen for Levi, son of Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya. He was cutting them</b> only <b>from the upper</b> surface of the spleen. Levi <b>said to</b> Rav Yehuda: <b>Go down further,</b> i.e., remove the fat that is lower down as well. Levi’s <b>father,</b> Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya, <b>came and found him</b> as Levi was saying this to Rav Yehuda. Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya <b>said to him: This is what your mother’s father said in the name of Rav; and who</b> was Levi’s mother’s father? It was <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba.</b> He said: <b>The Torah prohibits only</b> the membranes <b>that are on the thick,</b> upper surface of the spleen.
Levi asked: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Hamnuna say</b> that it was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the <b>membrane that is on the spleen is forbidden, but one is not liable</b> to receive the punishment of <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> eating <b>it?</b> Levi clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> referred to in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to the membranes <b>that are on the thick,</b> upper surface of the spleen, <b>why is one not liable</b> to the punishment of <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> eating <b>it? Rather,</b> it must be referring to the membranes <b>on all</b> sides <b>of</b> the spleen, even the underside. Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya <b>said to</b> his son, Levi: <b>If this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught, it is taught,</b> and I cannot take issue with it.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> mentioned above: <b>Rav Hamnuna said</b> that it was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>membrane that is on the spleen is forbidden, but one is not liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> eating <b>it.</b> The <b>membrane that is on</b> the <b>kidney is forbidden, but one is not liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> eating <b>it.</b> The Gemara challenges this statement: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one is liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> eating the membrane on the spleen or the kidney?
The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction between the <i>baraita</i> that states that one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for eating the membrane on the <b>spleen</b> and the <i>baraita</i> that states that one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for eating the membrane on the <b>spleen</b> is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i> that states that one is liable is referring to the membrane <b>on the thick,</b> upper part of the spleen, whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> that states that one is not liable is referring to the membrane <b>that is not on the thick</b> part of the spleen.
Likewise, the apparent contradiction between the <i>baraita</i> that states that one is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> for eating the membrane on the <b>kidney</b> and the <i>baraita</i> that states that one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for eating the membrane on the <b>kidney</b> is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i> that states that one is liable is referring to the membrane <b>on the upper</b> part of the kidney, whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> that states that one is not liable is referring to the membrane <b>on the lower</b> part of the kidney.
§ With regard to <b>testicles</b> that were <b>crushed</b> while the animal was alive but were still attached to their cords in the scrotum, there is a dispute between <b>Rav Ami and Rav Asi. One</b> of them <b>prohibits</b> eating the testicles after the animal is slaughtered <b>and one</b> of them <b>permits</b> eating them. The Gemara clarifies: <b>The one who prohibits</b> them holds that

Daf 93b

<b>since</b> these testicles <b>do not heal, they are</b> considered <b>a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> animal even though they are still attached to the animal. Consequently, they are forbidden even after the animal is slaughtered. And <b>the one who permits</b> eating crushed testicles holds that <b>since they do not rot, there is vitality in them,</b> and they are not considered to have been detached from the animal.
<b>And the other</b> opinion, which holds that crushed testicles are forbidden, holds that <b>the</b> reason the testicles <b>do not rot</b> is not because they have vitality but rather <b>because air does not penetrate</b> the scrotum, and it is contact with air that would cause them to rot. <b>And the other</b> opinion, which holds that crushed testicles are permitted, holds <b>that the</b> fact <b>that they do not heal</b> is because <b>they have been struck with weakness,</b> but not because they are entirely devoid of vitality. Consequently, they should not be considered detached from the body.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Rav Shemen bar Abba: These crushed testicles are permitted</b> for consumption, <b>but you should not eat them due to</b> the dictum: <b>“And do not forsake the Torah of your mother”</b> (Proverbs 1:8). Since Rav Shemen bar Abba was from Babylonia, where it was customary to be stringent, it was prohibited for him to eat crushed testicles even when he was in Eretz Yisrael.
§ The Gemara cites other <i>halakhot</i> related to testicles. <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said:</b> With regard to <b>these testicles of goats,</b> from the time the goat is born <b>until</b> the goat is <b>thirty days</b> old, its testicles <b>are permitted without peeling</b> off the membrane that encloses them, because they are presumed not to contain blood. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward, if they contain semen they are forbidden, but if they do not contain semen they are permitted.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How can we know</b> whether or not they contain semen? The Gemara answers: <b>If they have red streaks in them they are forbidden.</b> If they <b>do not have red streaks in them they are permitted.</b>
The Gemara quotes a related discussion pertaining to three cases: With regard to <b>raw meat</b> that is eaten without being salted, <b>testicles</b> of an animal, <b>and</b> the large <b>veins</b> of the neck, <b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree about</b> the <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara points out: <b>In all</b> of their disputes with regard to other realms of <b>the Torah</b> where it is not clear which of them holds which opinion, the opinion of <b>Ravina is lenient, and</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa is stringent, and the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Ravina to be lenient.</b> This applies to all their disputes <b>except for these three,</b> in <b>which Rav Aḥa is lenient and Ravina is stringent, and the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Aḥa to be lenient.</b>
The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>raw meat that became red</b> from the blood inside it, if <b>one cut it and salted it,</b> it is <b>permitted even to</b> cook it in <b>a pot,</b> because the salt removes blood from meat. It is <b>also</b> permitted if one <b>hung it on a spit</b> in order to roast it, because <b>the blood is drawn out</b> by the heat of the fire. With regard to a case where one placed it <b>on coals, Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree about</b> the <i>halakha</i>: <b>One says</b> that the coals <b>draw out</b> the blood from the meat, <b>and one says</b> that the coals cause the meat to <b>shrivel</b> and harden, trapping the blood inside. <b>And similarly</b> Ravina and Rav Aḥa disagree with regard to <b>testicles</b> placed on coals, <b>and similarly</b> with regard to the large <b>veins</b> of the neck that were placed on coals.
§ Apropos raw meat placed on coals, the Gemara discusses a related topic. In a case where one wants to remove the hair from <b>the head</b> of an animal by placing it <b>in hot ashes,</b> if <b>one placed it</b> with the neck down so that <b>the location of the slaughter</b> is in the ashes, <b>the blood is drawn out</b> by the heat <b>and</b> the meat <b>is permitted.</b> But if one placed the head in the ashes <b>on</b> one of its <b>sides,</b> the blood <b>congeals</b> inside the head and cannot flow out, <b>and</b> therefore the head is <b>forbidden</b> for consumption. In a case where one <b>placed</b> the head down <b>on its nostrils,</b> if <b>he inserted something into</b> the nostrils to keep them open and allow the blood to flow out, the meat is <b>permitted, but</b> if he did <b>not</b> do so it is <b>forbidden.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say:</b> If the head was placed <b>on its nostrils or on the location of the slaughter,</b> the blood is <b>drawn out</b> and the meat is permitted. If he placed it <b>on</b> one of its <b>sides,</b> then <b>if</b> he <b>inserted something into</b> it in order to allow the blood to flow out, it is <b>permitted, and if not it is forbidden.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: There are two nerves</b> included in the prohibition of the sciatic nerve. The <b>inner</b> nerve, which is <b>next to the bone, is forbidden</b> by Torah law, <b>and one is liable</b> to be flogged <b>for</b> eating <b>it.</b> The <b>outer</b> nerve, which is <b>next to the flesh, is forbidden</b> by rabbinic law, <b>and</b> therefore <b>one is not liable</b> to be flogged <b>for</b> eating <b>it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the <b>inner</b> nerve, which is forbidden by Torah law, is <b>next to the flesh?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Aḥa said</b> that <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> The inner nerve is next to the bone, but it <b>bores</b> into the flesh as well.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The outer</b> nerve <b>is next to the bone?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> This is referring to the spot <b>where the butchers</b> cut the leg open and <b>reveal</b> the nerve, and at that point in the leg the outer nerve is closest to the bone.
§ It <b>was stated:</b> With regard to <b>a butcher who</b> removed the forbidden fats of the animal, and yet <b>forbidden fat was found after</b> he completed his work, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that the butcher is held liable if there is forbidden fat remaining that is the size of <b>a barley grain. Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the butcher is held liable only if there is forbidden fat remaining that is the size <b>of an olive-bulk.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Rav Yehuda and Rabbi Yoḥanan are referring to two different levels of liability, <b>and they do not disagree. Here,</b> when Rabbi Yoḥanan said he is liable only if there is an olive-bulk of forbidden fat remaining, he was referring <b>to flogging him. There,</b> when Rav Yehuda said he is liable even he leaves forbidden fat the size of a barley grain, he was referring <b>to removing him</b> from his position as a butcher.
<b>Mar Zutra said</b> an alternative explanation: If the butcher left forbidden fat the size of <b>a barley grain in one place</b> he is liable, and if he left forbidden fat the size of <b>an olive-bulk,</b> he is liable <b>even</b> if it is spread out <b>in two or three places.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that with regard to <b>flogging him,</b> the butcher is liable only if he left forbidden fat the size of <b>an olive-bulk.</b> With regard <b>to removing him,</b> the butcher is liable even if he left forbidden fat the size of <b>a barley grain.</b>
§ The mishna stated (89b): <b>Butchers are not deemed credible</b> to say that the sciatic nerve was removed; this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: They are deemed credible about the sciatic nerve. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The Rabbis initially held that butchers are not deemed credible about the sciatic nerve, and subsequently <b>they retracted</b> and <b>said</b> that butchers are <b>deemed credible</b> in this regard.
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> to him: Have the later <b>generations improved</b> such that butchers are more reliable than they were in earlier generations? The Gemara answers: <b>Initially, when</b> the Rabbis <b>held in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> that one must scrape around the flesh in order to remove the roots of the sciatic nerve, butchers <b>were not deemed credible,</b> due to the exertion involved in this process. <b>But later</b> the Rabbis <b>held in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that it is unnecessary to scrape around the flesh. Consequently, removing the sciatic nerve is not especially arduous, and butchers are deemed credible to say that they removed it.
<b>There are those who teach</b> this discussion <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, as follows: <b>And the Rabbis say: They are deemed credible about</b> the sciatic nerve <b>and about the</b> forbidden <b>fat. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: They</b> subsequently <b>retracted</b> this opinion and <b>said</b> that butchers <b>are not deemed credible. Rav Naḥman says: Today</b> the butchers <b>are deemed credible.</b>
The Gemara asks: Have the later <b>generations improved</b> such that butchers are more reliable than they were in earlier generations? The Gemara answers: <b>Initially they held</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> that one is not required to scrape around the flesh to remove the roots of the sciatic nerve, and therefore butchers were deemed credible to say that they removed it. The Rabbis <b>then</b> reversed their opinion and <b>held</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> that one is required to scrape around the flesh.
As <b>long as</b> the butchers <b>remembered</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and did not scrape around the flesh to remove the roots of the sciatic nerve, <b>they were not deemed credible</b> to say that they removed it; <b>but now that they have forgotten</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and have grown accustomed to scraping around the flesh to remove the roots of the sciatic nerve, <b>they are deemed credible.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that the Rabbis maintain that butchers are deemed credible about the sciatic nerve <b>and about the</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who mentioned anything about</b> forbidden <b>fat?</b> The topic of discussion in the mishna until this point is the sciatic nerve, not forbidden fat; why do the Rabbis mention forbidden fat? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> The butchers <b>are not deemed credible about</b> the sciatic nerve <b>or about the</b> forbidden <b>fat;</b> this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. <b>But the Rabbis say:</b> The butchers <b>are deemed credible about</b> the sciatic nerve <b>and about the</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Although it is prohibited for Jews to eat the sciatic nerve, <b>a</b> Jewish <b>person</b> may <b>send</b> the <b>thigh</b> of an animal <b>to a gentile with the sciatic nerve in it,</b> without concern that the gentile will then sell the thigh to a Jew and the Jew will eat the sciatic nerve. This leniency is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the place</b> of the sciatic nerve <b>is conspicuous</b> in the thigh.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna’s statement that a Jew may send a thigh to a gentile indicates that if it is <b>whole, yes,</b> a Jew may send it to a gentile, but if the thigh has been <b>cut,</b> a Jew may <b>not</b> send it to a gentile. The Gemara asks: <b>What are we dealing with? If we say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a place where</b> all the butchers are Jewish but <b>they do not announce</b> publicly when they have sold to a gentile an animal that turns out to have a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>], then it is prohibited for Jews to purchase any meat from gentiles, due to the possibility that it was from an animal that was a <i>tereifa</i>.

Daf 94a

Consequently, it should <b>also</b> be permitted <b>to send</b> to a gentile a thigh that has been <b>cut, because</b> Jews <b>will not come to purchase</b> it <b>from him. Rather,</b> if the mishna is referring <b>to a place where</b> all the butchers are Jewish, and <b>they announce</b> every time they sell a <i>tereifa</i> to a gentile, in which case Jews may purchase meat from the local gentiles when such an announcement is not made, one should <b>not</b> be permitted <b>to send even a whole</b> thigh to a gentile, due to the concern <b>that</b> he might <b>cut it up and sell it to</b> Jews who would not realize that it still contains the sciatic nerve.
The Gemara offers two answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a place where they announce</b> every time they sell a <i>tereifa</i>; <b>and if you wish, say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time they sell a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara explains: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a place where they announce</b> every time they sell a <i>tereifa</i>, and nevertheless it is permitted to send a whole thigh of meat to a gentile. There is no concern that the gentile will sell the thigh to a Jew, because the Jew <b>would know</b> that it is non-kosher by the manner of <b>cutting of the gentile.</b> Jewish butchers would cut the meat in a distinctive manner that would not be replicated by a gentile who cut the meat.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time they sell a <i>tereifa</i>, and nevertheless it is prohibited to give the gentile a thigh that has been cut up. The Sages issued a <b>decree</b> against doing so, <b>lest he give it to</b> the gentile <b>in the presence of another Jew,</b> who will think that it is kosher and purchase it from the gentile.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that there is an entirely different reason why one may not send a gentile a cut-up thigh without removing the sciatic nerve: <b>Because he</b> thereby <b>deceives</b> the gentile. The gentile will think that the Jew has exerted himself to cut up the leg and remove the sciatic nerve and that although the Jew could have eaten the meat himself he decided to send it to the gentile. The gentile will therefore be more appreciative of the gift than he would be if he realized that the sciatic nerve had not been removed. This is <b>as Shmuel said: It is prohibited to deceive people, and even</b> to deceive <b>a gentile.</b>
<b>And</b> the Gemara points out that <b>this</b> ruling <b>of Shmuel was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference,</b> i.e., it was inferred based upon the following incident: <b>Shmuel was</b> once <b>crossing</b> a river <b>in a ferry [<i>mavra</i>]. He said to his attendant: Compensate the ferryman</b> with an appropriate gift. The attendant <b>compensated him, but</b> Shmuel <b>became angry</b> with his attendant.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that Shmuel <b>became angry? Abaye said:</b> The compensation that the attendant gave the ferryman <b>was a chicken</b> that was <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, and he gave it to him as though it were a slaughtered,</b> kosher chicken. <b>Rava said:</b> Shmuel <b>told him to give</b> the ferryman wine <b>for drinking</b> in <b>an <i>anpaka</i>,</b> i.e., a utensil that holds a quarter-<i>log</i> and which was generally used for undiluted wine, <b>but he gave him diluted wine for drinking.</b> According to both Abaye and Rava, Shmuel was upset that his attendant deceived the gentile ferryman.
The Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> Shmuel’s opinion was derived <b>by inference, what</b> of it? The story clearly demonstrates that according to Shmuel it is prohibited to deceive a gentile. The Gemara answers that it cannot be ascertained with certainty that this is the reason Shmuel became angry. <b>According to the one who said it was</b> a chicken that was <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> that was given as compensation, perhaps Shmuel became angry and <b>said to</b> his attendant: <b>Why did you retain</b> in your possession an animal that is <b>forbidden</b> for consumption? This could have led to a Jew accidentally eating it.
Similarly, <b>according to the one who said</b> that Shmuel <b>told him to give</b> the ferryman wine <b>to drink</b> in <b>an <i>anpaka</i>,</b> since <b><i>anpaka</i> indicates undiluted</b> wine and the attendant gave the ferryman diluted wine, perhaps Shmuel became angry simply because his attendant disobeyed his instruction.
§ Apropos the prohibition against acting deceitfully, the Gemara cites other statements on this topic. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would say: A person may not importune [<i>yesarhev</i>] another to eat with him,</b> making it seem as though he genuinely wants his company, <b>but</b> in reality he entreats him only because <b>he knows that</b> the other <b>will not eat</b> with him, i.e., will not accept the invitation. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>one may not</b> send another person <b>many gifts</b> merely because <b>he knows that</b> the other <b>will not accept</b> them.
<b>And one may not open barrels</b> of wine for a guest if they have already been <b>sold to a storekeeper, unless he notifies</b> the guest beforehand that the barrel had been sold. <b>And he may not say to</b> another: <b>Anoint</b> yourself with <b>oil,</b> and place <b>an empty</b> jug before him with the knowledge that he will not attempt to anoint himself. <b>But if</b> he does so <b>for</b> the guest’s <b>honor,</b> to show that he holds his guest in high esteem, rather than to deceive the guest so that he will feel indebted to him, <b>it is permitted.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Ulla happen</b> to come <b>to the house of Rav Yehuda,</b> and Rav Yehuda <b>opened barrels</b> of wine <b>for</b> Ulla <b>that</b> had already been <b>sold to a storekeeper?</b> The Gemara answers: Rav Yehuda <b>notified</b> Ulla that he was not opening the barrels especially for him. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>Ulla is different</b> from an ordinary guest <b>because he was</b> very <b>dear to Rav Yehuda, so that even without this,</b> i.e., even if he had not already sold the barrels to a storekeeper, Rav Yehuda would have <b>opened</b> the barrels <b>for him.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not go to a house of mourning with a</b> wine <b>jug [<i>lagin</i>] in his hand that</b> is mostly empty and where the small amount of wine <b>rattles</b> about, because the mourner will think that his visitor is bringing him a full jug of wine. <b>And he may not fill up</b> that jug of wine with <b>water, because he</b> thereby <b>misleads</b> the mourner into thinking he has brought him a full jug of undiluted wine. <b>But if there is a crowd of people [<i>ḥever ir</i>]</b> and the guest wants to honor the mourner in their presence, <b>it is permitted.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not sell to another a sandal</b> made from the hide <b>of</b> an animal that <b>died</b> of natural causes <b>as</b> though it were a sandal made from the hide <b>of a healthy animal that was slaughtered.</b> This is prohibited <b>due to two factors: One, because he misleads</b> the customer into thinking that the leather is of higher quality than it really is; <b>and another, because of the danger</b> involved, as it is possible that the animal died from a snakebite and the poison seeped into the part of the animal’s hide from which the sandal is made.
<b>And</b> furthermore <b>a person may not send a barrel of wine to another with oil floating at its mouth,</b> such that the recipient thinks that it is a barrel of oil. There was <b>an incident involving a certain</b> individual <b>who sent a barrel of wine to another with oil floating at its mouth, and that</b> recipient, thinking it was a barrel of oil, <b>went and invited guests</b> to share <b>it</b> with him, <b>and</b> the guests <b>arrived.</b> When the host went to bring them oil, <b>he found that it was</b> a barrel <b>of wine</b> rather than oil, <b>and</b> in his shame at not having oil for them, <b>he hanged himself</b> and died.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And guests are not permitted to give</b> some <b>of</b> the food <b>that is</b> placed <b>before them to the son or to the daughter of the host unless they</b> first <b>receive permission from the host.</b>
<b>And</b> there was <b>an incident involving a certain</b> individual <b>who invited three guests during years of famine, and he had</b> enough <b>to place only three eggs before them. The son of the host came,</b> and <b>one of</b> the guests <b>took his portion and gave it to</b> the son. <b>And similarly the second</b> guest gave his portion to the son, <b>and similarly the third</b> guest. <b>The father of the child came and found that</b> his son was <b>holding one</b> egg <b>in his mouth and two in his hand.</b> The father became so angry with his son for taking all the food that <b>he hit</b> the son <b>to the ground, and</b> the son <b>died. When his mother saw</b> what had happened, <b>she ascended to the roof and fell</b> down to the ground <b>and died.</b> And when the father saw that both his son and his wife were dead <b>he also ascended to the roof and fell</b> down to the ground <b>and died.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov said: For this matter</b> of giving food to the child of the host, <b>three Jewish souls were killed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What does this</b> statement <b>teach us?</b> It is obvious from the incident that three people were killed. The Gemara answers: It teaches <b>that the entire</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> taught by <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who sends</b> a whole <b>thigh</b> of an animal <b>to another, he is not required to</b> first <b>remove the sciatic nerve from it.</b> This is because the recipient can see that it has not yet been removed and will not eat it until he removes the sciatic nerve himself. But if one sends a thigh that has been <b>cut</b> up, <b>he is required to</b> first <b>remove the sciatic nerve from it</b> so that the recipient does not eat it unwittingly. <b>And in</b> the case of one who sends a thigh to <b>a gentile,</b> regardless of <b>whether it is cut or whole he is not required to remove the sciatic nerve from it.</b>
<b>And</b> it was <b>due to two factors</b> that the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one may not sell</b> meat from unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses or <i>tereifot</i> to a gentile: One, because it misleads him,</b> as he thinks that it is kosher meat, which is more desirable; <b>and another</b> factor is the concern <b>lest</b> the gentile <b>then sell</b> the meat <b>to another Jew,</b> who will think it is kosher since it originally was sold by a Jew.
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>a person may not say to a gentile: Purchase meat for me</b> from a Jewish butcher <b>with this dinar, due to two factors:</b>

Daf 94b

<b>One</b> factor is <b>because of the oppressors,</b> i.e., the concern that perhaps the gentile will keep the money for himself and force the merchant to give him the meat without payment. <b>And another</b> factor is <b>lest</b> the merchant <b>sell him</b> meat from unslaughtered <b>carcasses or <i>tereifot</i></b> without realizing that the gentile is purchasing the meat on behalf of a Jew.
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And in</b> the case of one who sends a thigh to <b>a gentile,</b> regardless of <b>whether it is cut or whole he is not required to remove the sciatic nerve from it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are we dealing with? If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to a place</b> where all the butchers are Jewish and <b>they announce</b> every time they sell non-kosher meat to a gentile, then in the case of a thigh that has been <b>cut, why</b> is one <b>not required to remove the sciatic nerve? Since it was not announced</b> that they sold non-kosher meat, a Jew might <b>come to purchase it from</b> a gentile without realizing that it still contains the sciatic nerve.
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that it is referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time they sell non-kosher meat, and in such a place a Jew would not purchase meat from a gentile. But <b>say the middle clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: And it was <b>due to two factors</b> that the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one may not sell</b> meat from unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses or <i>tereifot</i> to a gentile: One</b> is <b>because it misleads him; and another</b> is the concern <b>lest</b> the gentile <b>then sell</b> the meat <b>to another Jew,</b> who will think it is kosher since it originally was sold by a Jew.
<b>But if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time they sell non-kosher meat to a gentile, a Jew <b>will not come to purchase</b> the meat <b>from</b> the gentile. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a place where they announce</b> every time they sell non-kosher meat.
But <b>say the latter clause:</b> And similarly, <b>a person may not say to a gentile: Purchase meat for me with this dinar, due to two factors. One</b> factor is <b>because of the oppressors, and another</b> factor is <b>lest</b> the merchant <b>sell him</b> meat from unslaughtered <b>carcasses or <i>tereifot</i></b> without realizing that the gentile is purchasing the meat on behalf of a Jew. <b>But if</b> it is referring <b>to a place where they announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold, <b>if</b> it would happen <b>that it was a <i>tereifa</i></b> the butchers <b>would have announced</b> the fact, and the Jew would know not to eat that meat.
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold. But is it possible that <b>the first clause and the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> are referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold but <b>the middle clause</b> is referring <b>to a place where they</b> do <b>announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold?
<b>Abaye said: Yes, the first clause and the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> are referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold, and <b>the middle clause</b> is referring <b>to a place where they</b> do <b>announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold.
<b>Rava said:</b> The <b>entire</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a place where they announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold. <b>The first clause and the latter clause</b> are referring to days <b>when they announced</b> that non-kosher meat had been sold, and <b>the middle clause</b> is referring to a day <b>when they did not announce</b> that non-kosher meat had been sold.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The <b>entire</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a place where they do not announce</b> every time non-kosher meat is sold. <b>And</b> the reason that <b>the middle clause</b> teaches that it is prohibited to sell meat from unslaughtered carcasses or <i>tereifot</i> to a gentile is due to <b>a</b> rabbinic <b>decree lest</b> the Jew <b>sell it</b> to the gentile <b>in the presence of</b> another <b>Jew,</b> who will think that this particular piece of meat is kosher.
§ The Gemara noted that there were places where they would announce whenever non-kosher meat was sold to a gentile. The Gemara asks: <b>How do we announce</b> that non-kosher meat has been sold? The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef said: Meat has fallen</b> into our possession <b>for the soldiers,</b> i.e., the gentiles.
The Gemara objects: <b>But let</b> them <b>say: A <i>tereifa</i> has fallen</b> into our possession <b>for the soldiers.</b> The Gemara answers that if a butcher would publicize the fact that it is a <i>tereifa</i>, the gentiles would <b>not purchase</b> it from him because they would not want an animal rejected by the Jews.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the announcement is made in a way that obscures from the gentiles the fact that the animal is a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>doesn’t</b> this <b>deceive them?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is they who deceive themselves,</b> because the seller does not specify which kind of meat he is selling.
The Gemara cites proof that it is permitted to allow others to mislead themselves. It is <b>like this</b> incident <b>when Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, was going from</b> the city of <b>Sikhra to</b> the city of <b>Bei Meḥoza, and</b> at the same time <b>Rava and Rav Safra were going to Sikhra. They met each other,</b> and Mar Zutra <b>thought they were coming</b> out to greet <b>him. He said to them: Why did the Rabbis exert</b> themselves <b>and come all this</b> way to greet me? <b>Rav Safra said to him: We did not know that the Master was coming; if we would have known we would have exerted</b> ourselves <b>more.</b>
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Safra: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you said this</b> to Mar Zutra? <b>By</b> telling him that we were not coming to greet him you <b>upset him.</b> Rav Safra <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>But</b> if I would not have said so <b>we</b> would have <b>misled him.</b> Rava responded: Mar Zutra <b>misled himself,</b> since we never said we were coming to greet him.
§ The Gemara returns to the topic of selling non-kosher meat to a gentile. There was <b>a certain</b> Jewish <b>butcher who said to another</b> individual:

Daf 95a

<b>If you would have made peace with me</b> yesterday, <b>wouldn’t I have given you</b> a cut <b>from the fattened bull that I prepared yesterday?</b> The other individual <b>said to him:</b> Nevertheless <b>I ate from the finest of the fine</b> of that bull that you prepared. The butcher <b>said to him: From where</b> did <b>you</b> get a piece? The other <b>said to him: So-and-so the gentile bought</b> it <b>and fed</b> it <b>to me.</b> The butcher <b>said to him: I prepared two</b> bulls yesterday. One was kosher, <b>but that one</b> you ate <b>was a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> which is why I sold it to a gentile.
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> when he heard of this incident: <b>Because of this imbecile who acted improperly</b> and sold non-kosher meat to the gentile butcher without publicizing that he did so, should <b>we forbid all</b> of <b>the</b> meat from gentile <b>butcher shops</b> in the city?
The Gemara notes that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> If there are <b>butcher shops</b> in a city <b>and Jewish butchers</b> prepare the meat, any <b>meat found in the possession of a gentile,</b> i.e., in a gentile’s butcher shop, <b>is permitted.</b> There is no concern that the meat is from an animal that was a <i>tereifa</i>, because the Jewish butcher would not have sold it to a gentile to sell in his butcher shop.
The Gemara presents an alternate version of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s reaction to the incident cited above: <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: Because of this imbecile, who intended</b> only <b>to cause distress to his fellow,</b> should <b>we forbid all</b> of <b>the</b> meat from gentile <b>butcher shops?</b> That butcher was presumably lying about the meat having been from a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara notes that <b>the reason</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi considers the meat to be kosher is <b>that</b> the butcher <b>intended</b> only <b>to cause distress to his fellow.</b> This indicates that if <b>that were not so,</b> all the meat in the gentile butcher shops would be <b>forbidden. But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> If there are <b>butcher shops</b> in a city <b>and Jewish butchers</b> prepare the meat, any <b>meat found in the possession of a gentile is permitted?</b> The Gemara answers: It is <b>different here because it has been established</b> that there is <b>forbidden</b> meat being sold in the butcher shops. Since it is known that a Jewish butcher sold non-kosher meat to a gentile proprietor of a butcher shop, one must be concerned that this was not an isolated incident.
§ Apropos meat in the possession of a gentile, the Gemara cites a related discussion. <b>Rav says: Once meat is obscured from sight</b> and unsupervised, it is <b>forbidden,</b> as one must be concerned that it was exchanged for non-kosher meat. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> If there are <b>butcher shops</b> in a city <b>and Jewish butchers</b> prepare the meat, any <b>meat found in the possession of a gentile is permitted.</b> The Gemara answers: Meat <b>found in the possession of a gentile is different,</b> because the meat was not left unsupervised.
The Gemara raises another objection to the statement of Rav. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>nine stores</b> in a city, <b>all of which sell</b> kosher <b>meat</b> from <b>a slaughtered</b> animal, <b>and one</b> other store that <b>sells meat</b> from unslaughtered <b>animal carcasses, and</b> an individual <b>purchased</b> meat <b>from one of</b> the stores <b>and he does not know from which</b> store <b>he purchased</b> the meat, in this case of <b>uncertainty,</b> the meat <b>is forbidden. But in</b> the case of meat <b>found</b> outside, <b>follow the majority.</b> Consequently, since most of the stores sell kosher meat, it may be assumed that the meat found outside is kosher, which contradicts Rav’s statement that meat that was left unsupervised is forbidden. The Gemara answers: <b>Here also</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the meat was not unsupervised but rather was <b>found in the possession of a gentile.</b>
The Gemara cites another challenge to the opinion of Rav: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 2:9): If one <b>found meat in</b> a city inhabited by both Jews and gentiles, <b>if</b> the meat <b>is raw, follow the majority of butchers,</b> so that if the majority of the butchers are Jewish, the meat is presumed to be kosher. <b>And if</b> the meat <b>is cooked, follow the majority of meat eaters,</b> because even if the majority of the butchers are Jewish, if the meat was cooked by a gentile it is forbidden. This mishna indicates that there are circumstances when the meat is permitted even though it was obscured from sight.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>here also</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the meat <b>is found in the possession of a gentile,</b> why does the <i>baraita</i> state that if the meat is cooked, one should <b>follow the majority of meat eaters? Let us see</b> whether <b>a gentile is holding it or a Jew is holding it.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case where the meat was on the ground but someone was <b>standing and watching it</b> from the time it was dropped on the ground, so that it was never left unsupervised. Yet, the person watching does not know whether it was dropped by a Jew or a gentile, and therefore a determination must be made based upon the majority of the people in the city.
The Gemara cites another challenge to the opinion of Rav from a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 19a). <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> With regard to meat <b>found in the outlying areas,</b> outside of Jerusalem, if it is found as whole <b>limbs,</b> the meat presumably comes from <b>carcasses</b> of animals that were not properly slaughtered, as carcasses were generally cut up into full limbs and fed to dogs or sold to gentiles. But if it is in small <b>pieces,</b> it is presumably kosher and <b>permitted</b> to be eaten, as kosher meat was ordinarily cut up into small pieces. This mishna indicates that even though the meat was obscured from sight, it remains permitted. <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>here also</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> someone was <b>standing and watching it, why</b> is it assumed to be from <b>a carcass</b> if it is cut into whole <b>limbs?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> mishna requires <b>explanation only according to Rav,</b> but <b>wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna: <b>Rav says</b> that the correct version of the mishna is that the small pieces of meat are <b>permitted,</b> in that they are not considered impure and that one who eats them is not liable to be flogged, as would be the case if it were meat from a <b>carcass.</b> But it is not actually permitted to eat the meat, due to the fact that it was obscured from sight. <b>And Levi says:</b> The mishna means to say that the small pieces of meat are even <b>permitted to be eaten.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And this</b> statement <b>of Rav,</b> that meat that was obscured from sight is forbidden, <b>was not stated explicitly</b> by Rav. <b>Rather, it was stated</b> that he held this opinion <b>based on an inference</b> from a different statement of Rav. <b>As, Rav was</b> once <b>sitting on the ford of</b> the <b>Ishtetit River. He saw a certain man who was</b>

Daf 95b

<b>cleaning</b> the <b>head</b> of an animal in the river. The head <b>fell from him. He went and brought a basket, cast</b> the basket into the river, and <b>pulled out two</b> animal heads. <b>Rav said</b> to him: Does it commonly <b>happen this</b> way that one loses one item and finds two? Just as one of the animal heads is not the one you dropped, it is possible that neither of them is the one you dropped. Therefore, Rav rendered both of <b>them forbidden to him.</b>
<b>Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav:</b> Is <b>forbidden</b> meat <b>common</b> but <b>permitted</b> meat <b>not common?</b> Most of the meat in this general location is kosher, so why did you forbid the two animal heads? <b>He said to them: Forbidden</b> meat <b>is more common.</b> From this incident the Sages derived that according to Rav, meat that has been obscured from sight becomes forbidden due to the possibility that the meat one finds now was actually deposited by ravens, who transported it from a location where the majority of the meat is forbidden.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> does it matter <b>if</b> this opinion of Rav is known <b>by inference</b> based on this incident, rather than by an explicit statement made by Rav? The Gemara answers: There is room to say that this incident cannot serve as a precedent for a general policy, because that location <b>was a port of gentiles,</b> where most of the meat was non-kosher. <b>Know</b> that this is the case, <b>as</b> Rav <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana and Rav Asi: <b>Forbidden</b> meat <b>is more common.</b> Consequently, it is possible that Rav would not have prohibited the meat in a location where the majority of the meat is kosher.
The Gemara asks: <b>But how did Rav</b> ever <b>eat meat</b> if he holds that meat becomes forbidden if it is unsupervised for even a short time? The Gemara answers: Rav ate meat only <b>in its time,</b> i.e., shortly after it was slaughtered, <b>when it had not been obscured from his sight</b> from the time of the slaughter until he ate it. Alternatively, <b>if you wish, say</b> that Rav ate meat that was <b>tied and sealed</b> in a way that proved it had not been swapped for non-kosher meat. <b>Or alternatively,</b> he ate meat that could be recognized <b>by a distinguishing mark, like that</b> practice of <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna,</b> who would <b>cut</b> meat into pieces <b>with three corners,</b> i.e., triangles, before he would send it to his family members.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav was going to the home of Rav Ḥanan, his son-in-law. He saw</b> that <b>the ferry was coming toward him</b> just when he arrived at the riverbank. <b>He said: The ferry is coming toward me</b> even though I did not arrange for it to come now; this is a sign that <b>a good day,</b> i.e., a festive meal, awaits me <b>in</b> the place where I am going.
After crossing the river on the ferry, Rav <b>went and stood at the gate</b> of Rav Ḥanan’s home. <b>He looked</b> through <b>a crack in the door</b> and <b>saw an animal that was hanging</b> and ready to be cooked. <b>He knocked on the gate,</b> and <b>everyone went out to</b> greet <b>him,</b> and <b>the butchers also came</b> out to greet him. <b>Rav did not remove his eyes from</b> the meat that the butchers were preparing. <b>He said to them: If</b> you had eaten the meat based upon the supervision you provided <b>now,</b> you would have <b>fed forbidden</b> meat <b>to the sons of</b> my <b>daughter</b> because no one apart from me was watching the meat when you all came out to greet me. And despite the fact that he had kept the meat in his sight <b>Rav did not eat from that meat.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that Rav did not eat the meat? <b>If</b> one suggests that he was concerned <b>because</b> it had been <b>obscured</b> from sight, that cannot be the reason, as Rav kept watching it so that it <b>was not obscured</b> from sight. <b>Rather,</b> Rav did not eat <b>because he divined,</b> i.e., he saw the arrival of the ferry as a good omen. This is prohibited, and therefore Rav penalized himself and abstained from the meat.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rav say</b> that <b>any divination that is not like</b> the divination of <b>Eliezer, the servant of Abraham,</b> when he went to seek a bride for Isaac (see Genesis 24:14), <b>or like</b> the divination of <b>Jonathan, son of Saul,</b> who sought an omen as to whether he and his arms bearer would defeat the Philistines (see I Samuel 14:8–12), <b>is not divination?</b> Since Rav did not rely on the omen in his decision making, he did not violate the prohibition against divination, and there was no reason for him to penalize himself. The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the reason Rav did not eat the meat is that <b>it was an optional feast,</b> rather than a feast associated with a mitzva, <b>and Rav would not derive pleasure from an optional feast.</b>
Having mentioned Rav’s reaction to the ferry in the incident cited above, the Gemara states that <b>Rav would check</b> whether to travel based upon <b>the ferry;</b> if it came quickly he would take the ferry, but otherwise he would not. <b>And Shmuel would check</b> what would happen to him <b>by</b> opening <b>a scroll</b> and reading from wherever it was open to. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan would check</b> what was in store for him <b>by</b> asking <b>a child</b> to recite the verse he was learning.
The Gemara relates an incident when Rabbi Yoḥanan checked his luck based on a child’s verse. During <b>all the years</b> when <b>Rav</b> lived in Babylonia, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who lived in Eretz Yisrael, would <b>write to him</b> and begin with the greeting: <b>To our Master who is in Babylonia. When</b> Rav <b>died,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>would write to Shmuel</b> and begin with the greeting: <b>To our colleague who is in Babylonia.</b> Shmuel <b>said: Does</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>not know</b> any <b>matter in which I am his master?</b> Shmuel <b>wrote</b> and <b>sent to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan the calculation of the <b>leap</b> years <b>for</b> the next <b>sixty years.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan was not impressed by this and <b>said: Now he</b> has <b>merely</b> demonstrated that <b>he knows mathematics,</b> which does not make him my master.
Shmuel then <b>wrote</b> and <b>sent to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan explications of <b>uncertainties</b> pertaining to <b><i>tereifot</i></b> that had to be transported on <b>thirteen camels.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan was impressed by this and <b>said: I have a Master in Babylonia; I will go and see him.</b> Before departing on his journey, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to a child: Recite to me your verse</b> that you studied today. The child <b>recited</b> the following verse <b>to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>“Now Samuel was dead”</b> (I Samuel 28:3). Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Learn from this</b> that <b>Shmuel has died.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan did not go to see Shmuel.
The Gemara comments: <b>But it was not so; Shmuel had not died. Rather,</b> the reason Rabbi Yoḥanan was given this sign was <b>so that Rabbi Yoḥanan would not trouble himself</b> to embark on the long and arduous journey from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> With regard to one who is successful with his first business transaction after he has built <b>a home,</b> after the birth of <b>a child, or</b> after he marries <b>a woman, even though</b> he may <b>not</b> use this as a means of <b>divination</b> to decide upon future courses of action, <b>it is</b> an auspicious <b>sign</b> that he will continue to be successful. Conversely, if his first transaction is not successful he may take that as an inauspicious sign.
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: But this</b> is provided <b>that</b> the sign <b>has been established</b> by repeating itself <b>three times.</b> This is based on a verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “And Jacob their father said to them: Me you have bereaved of my children: <b>Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and you will take Benjamin away;</b> upon me are all these things come” (Genesis 42:36). If calamity were to befall Benjamin, that would establish a pattern of three tragedies.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss distinguishing marks that prevent meat from being prohibited despite its having been obscured from sight. <b>Rav Huna inquired of Rav:</b> If pieces of meat were <b>strung</b> together and then were obscured from sight, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav <b>said to him: Do not be an imbecile;</b> of course if the meat is <b>strung</b> together <b>it is</b> considered to be <b>a distinguishing mark,</b> and the meat is permitted. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> this <i>halakha</i> as follows: <b>Rav Huna said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If pieces of meat are <b>strung</b> together <b>it is a distinguishing mark,</b> and the meat remains permitted even if it is obscured from sight.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Naḥman of Neharde’a arrived at</b> the home of <b>Rav Kahana in Pum Nahara on the eve of Yom Kippur,</b> which is a day when people commonly eat meat. <b>Ravens came</b> and <b>dropped livers and kidneys.</b> Rav Kahana <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>Take</b> these livers and kidneys <b>and eat</b> them, as they are not forbidden, even though they were obscured from sight. This is because <b>at this time permitted</b> meat is <b>more common</b> than forbidden meat, since Jews slaughter many animals on this day.
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin lost</b> a cut of meat from an animal <b>intestine among</b> the <b>barrels</b> of wine in his wine cellar. When he found it, <b>he came before Rav Huna</b> to ask whether the meat was now prohibited because it had been obscured from sight. Rav Huna <b>said to him: Do you have a distinguishing mark on it</b> so that you can identify it? Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin <b>said to him: No.</b> Rav Huna asked him: <b>Do you have visual recognition of it?</b> Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rav Huna said: <b>If so, go and take</b> it and eat it.
<b>Rav Ḥanina Ḥoza’a lost a side of meat.</b> When he found it, <b>he came before Rav Naḥman</b> and asked him whether the meat was now prohibited because it had been obscured from sight. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Do you have a distinguishing mark on it</b> so that you can identify it? Rav Ḥanina Ḥoza’a <b>said to him: No.</b> Rav Naḥman asked him: <b>Do you have visual recognition of it?</b> Rav Ḥanina Ḥoza’a <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rav Naḥman said: <b>If so, go and take</b> it and eat it.
<b>Rav Natan bar Abaye lost a skein of sky-blue</b> wool prepared for use in ritual fringes. He searched for it and found it. <b>He came before Rav Ḥisda</b> to ask whether the wool was now prohibited because it had been obscured from sight and may have become confused with other blue wool that is not valid for ritual fringes. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: Do you have a distinguishing mark in it</b> so that you can identify it? Rav Natan bar Abaye <b>said to him: No.</b> Rav Ḥisda asked him: <b>Do you have visual recognition of it?</b> Rav Natan bar Abaye <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rav Ḥisda said: <b>If so, go and take</b> it, and you may use it for ritual fringes.
<b>Rava said: At first I would say</b> that <b>a distinguishing mark is preferable to visual recognition, because we return a lost item</b> to its owner based <b>on a distinguishing mark,</b>

Daf 96a

<b>but we do not return</b> a lost item to one who claims to be its owner based solely <b>on visual recognition.</b> But <b>now that I have heard these statements</b> pertaining to meat or sky-blue wool that were obscured from sight and then permitted based upon visual recognition, <b>I say</b> that <b>visual recognition is preferable</b> to a distinguishing mark.
Furthermore, one must hold that sensory recognition is reliable even without identifying marks, <b>for if you do not say so, how is</b> it that <b>a blind</b> man <b>permitted to</b> engage in sexual intercourse with <b>his wife</b> despite the fact that he cannot identify her by means of her identifying marks? <b>And</b> similarly, <b>how are</b> any <b>men permitted to</b> engage in intercourse with <b>their wives at night,</b> when it is dark and they cannot see their wives’ identifying marks? <b>Rather,</b> one must say that they identify their wives <b>based on voice recognition. Here too,</b> in these cases of lost meat and sky-blue wool, they remain permitted <b>based on visual recognition.</b>
<b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Mesharshiyya, said:</b> You can <b>know</b> that visual recognition is preferable to a distinguishing mark, <b>because if two</b> witnesses <b>come</b> to court <b>and say: So-and-so, who has this distinguishing mark and that distinguishing mark, killed a person, we</b> would <b>not kill him</b> based on this testimony. <b>But if</b> the two witnesses <b>say: We have visual recognition of him,</b> and they confirm that the accused individual committed murder, <b>we kill him</b> based on their testimony.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> You can <b>know</b> that visual recognition is preferable to a distinguishing mark, <b>because if a man says to his agent: Call so-and-so, who</b> has <b>this distinguishing mark and that distinguishing mark, it is uncertain</b> whether the agent will recognize him and <b>know</b> whom to call or whether he will <b>not know him. But if he has visual recognition of</b> him, <b>when he sees him he will know</b> it is <b>him.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who removes the sciatic nerve must</b> scrape away the flesh in the area surrounding the nerve to ensure <b>that he will remove all of it. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Scraping is not required; it is sufficient to excise it from the area above the rounded protrusion <b>in order to</b> thereby <b>fulfill the mitzva of removal</b> of the sciatic nerve.
<b>One who eats an olive-bulk of the sciatic nerve incurs forty</b> lashes. If <b>one eats</b> an entire sciatic nerve <b>and it does not</b> constitute <b>an olive-bulk,</b> he is nevertheless <b>liable</b> to receive lashes, because a complete sciatic nerve is a complete entity. If <b>one ate an olive-bulk from this</b> sciatic nerve in the right leg, <b>and an olive-bulk from that</b> sciatic nerve in the left leg, <b>he incurs [<i>sofeg</i>] eighty</b> lashes. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: He incurs only forty</b> lashes, for eating the olive-bulk from the right leg, and he is exempt for eating the olive-bulk from the left leg.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A man known as <b>bar Peyoli was standing before Shmuel and was removing</b> the sciatic nerve from the <b>leg</b> of an animal. <b>He was cutting</b> out the nerve without scraping away the surrounding flesh, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. Shmuel <b>said to him: Go down further</b> and scrape away the flesh in order to remove the entire nerve. <b>Now,</b> if I would <b>not have seen you</b> and instructed you in the process of removing the sciatic nerve, <b>you would have fed me forbidden</b> meat.
Bar Peyoli became <b>afraid</b> due to Shmuel’s rebuke and <b>the knife fell from his hand.</b> Shmuel <b>said to him: Do not be afraid.</b> I do not think that you are an ignoramus or a wicked person. You are removing the sciatic nerve as you were taught; the person <b>who taught you</b> must hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and this is how <b>he taught you</b> to remove the sciatic nerve. But I hold that the entire sciatic nerve must be removed, in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>.
<b>Rav Sheshet said</b> in explanation of this incident: <b>That which bar Peyoli removed was</b> the section of the sciatic nerve one is required to remove <b>by Torah law according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara asks: Based upon this statement, one can derive <b>by inference that he left</b> behind the section of the sciatic nerve one is required to remove <b>by rabbinic law according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. But</b> if so, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion did the person <b>who taught him</b> how to remove the sciatic nerve <b>teach him?</b> Even according to Rabbi Yehuda he would have transgressed a rabbinic prohibition.
<b>Rather, Rav Sheshet said: That which bar Peyoli removed</b> was the section of the sciatic nerve that is forbidden <b>by Torah law. And that which he left</b> over is forbidden <b>by rabbinic law according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as explained above (92b) in a <i>baraita</i>; <b>as if</b> one were to follow the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> the section that bar Peyoli left over <b>is permitted even by rabbinic law.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One who eats</b> an olive-bulk <b>of the sciatic nerve</b> incurs forty lashes. <b>Shmuel says: The Torah prohibits only</b> the part of the sciatic nerve <b>that is on the</b> rounded protrusion of flesh shaped like <b>a spoon</b> that is near the end of the femur. This is <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve that is <b>upon the spoon of the thigh”</b> (Genesis 32:33).
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> This statement of Shmuel is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one ate</b> the entire sciatic nerve and <b>it did not contain an olive-bulk, he is</b> nevertheless <b>liable</b> to be flogged. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He is not liable <b>unless it has</b> a volume of at least <b>an olive-bulk.</b>
Rav Pappa explains how this relates to Shmuel’s statement. <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda? They hold that the sciatic nerve <b>is a distinct entity.</b> Therefore, even if one eats less than an olive-bulk it is a significant act of eating, and one is liable.

Daf 96b

<b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> hold? He holds that since the term: <b>Eating, is written with regard to</b> the sciatic nerve, and a significant act of eating is generally defined as eating an olive-bulk, one is liable only if he eats an olive-bulk. <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive from this term? <b>That</b> usage of the term <b>eating</b> indicates <b>that</b> in a case where the sciatic nerve <b>contains four or five olive-bulks and</b> one <b>ate</b> only <b>one olive-bulk, he is liable.</b> Nevertheless, if one eats the entire sciatic nerve, he is liable even if it contains less than an olive-bulk.
<b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> from where is it derived that one is liable for eating one olive-bulk of a larger sciatic nerve? He holds that it <b>is derived from</b> the phrase <b>“that is upon the spoon of the thigh,”</b> which indicates that even if one eats only the part of the sciatic nerve that is upon the spoon of the thigh, rather than the entire sciatic nerve, he is liable.
<b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> interpret that phrase? <b>That</b> phrase <b>is necessary to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> stated by <b>Shmuel, as Shmuel said: The Torah prohibits only</b> the part of the sciatic nerve <b>that is on the</b> rounded protrusion of flesh shaped like a <b>spoon. And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> hold with regard to the <i>halakha</i> stated by Shmuel? He derives from the fact that it <b>is written:</b> “The spoon of <b>the thigh,”</b> that the sciatic nerve <b>of the entire thigh</b> is forbidden, not just the part that is on the rounded protrusion of flesh shaped like a spoon.
<b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> interpret “the spoon of the thigh”? According to the Rabbis, <b>this</b> expression indicates that <b>the prohibition of</b> the sciatic nerve applies to the nerve <b>that extends</b> throughout <b>the entire thigh,</b> i.e., the inner nerve, which serves <b>to exclude the outer</b> nerve, <b>which is not</b> forbidden by Torah law; <b>but in fact,</b> only the part of the inner nerve <b>that is on the</b> protrusion of flesh shaped like <b>a spoon</b> is forbidden, not the entire inner nerve.
The Gemara objects: <b>But this</b> term <b>“spoon” is required to exclude</b> the sciatic nerve of <b>a bird, which does not have</b> a rounded protrusion on its thigh bone that can be described as the <b>spoon of the thigh,</b> as taught in the mishna (89b). The Gemara explains: There are <b>two</b> usages of the term <b>“spoon”</b> written in the verse, and therefore two separate <i>halakhot</i> can be derived from this term.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a thigh that was cooked</b> with <b>the sciatic nerve in it, if there is</b> enough of the sciatic nerve <b>in it</b> to <b>impart</b> its <b>flavor</b> to the thigh, the entire thigh <b>is forbidden</b> for consumption. <b>How does one measure</b> whether there is enough sciatic nerve to impart flavor to the meat of the entire thigh? One relates to it <b>as though</b> the sciatic nerve were <b>meat</b> imparting flavor <b>to a turnip.</b> If meat the volume of the sciatic nerve would impart flavor to a turnip the volume of the thigh when they were cooked together, then the entire thigh is forbidden.
With regard to <b>a sciatic nerve that was cooked with</b> other <b>sinews, when one identifies</b> the sciatic nerve and removes it, the other sinews are forbidden if the sciatic nerve was large enough to <b>impart flavor. And if</b> he does <b>not</b> identify it, <b>all</b> the sinews are <b>forbidden</b> because each one could be the sciatic nerve; <b>but the broth</b> is forbidden only if the sciatic nerve <b>imparts flavor</b> to the broth.
<b>And similarly,</b> in the case of <b>a piece of an animal carcass or a piece of non-kosher fish that was cooked with</b> similar <b>pieces</b> of kosher meat or fish, <b>when one identifies</b> the forbidden piece and removes it, the rest of the meat or fish is forbidden only if the forbidden piece was large enough to <b>impart flavor</b> to the entire mixture. <b>And if</b> he does <b>not</b> identify and remove the forbidden piece, <b>all</b> the pieces <b>are forbidden,</b> due to the possibility that each piece one selects might be the forbidden piece; <b>but the broth</b> is forbidden only if the forbidden piece <b>imparts flavor</b> to the broth.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that a thigh that was cooked with the sciatic nerve is forbidden if the nerve imparts flavor to the thigh. <b>Shmuel says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the thigh is entirely forbidden <b>only when it was cooked</b> with the sciatic nerve <b>inside it. But</b> if the sciatic nerve was <b>roasted inside</b> the thigh, one may <b>peel</b> away the meat <b>and eat</b> it <b>until he reaches the</b> sciatic <b>nerve,</b> and then he removes the nerve.
The Gemara challenges: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rav Huna say:</b> With regard to <b>a kid that was roasted with its</b> forbidden <b>fat, it is prohibited to eat</b> any part of the animal, <b>even from the top of its ear?</b> This proves that roasting, like cooking, spreads the flavor of the forbidden fat throughout the entire animal.

Daf 97a

The Gemara answers: Forbidden <b>fat is different</b> from the sciatic nerve, <b>because</b> its flavor <b>permeates</b> throughout the animal, unlike that of the sciatic nerve.
The Gemara challenges Rav Huna’s statement: <b>And</b> in the case of a kid roasted <b>with</b> its forbidden <b>fat,</b> is the meat <b>forbidden? But didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say: There was an incident</b> that came <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan in the synagogue of</b> the town of <b>Maon, where a young goat was roasted with its fat, and</b> the people <b>came and asked Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> about the status of the meat, <b>and he said: Peel</b> away the meat <b>and eat</b> it <b>until</b> you <b>reach the</b> forbidden <b>fat?</b> This indicates that the flavor of the fat does not permeate the entire animal in which it is roasted. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> kid <b>was lean</b> and had so little fat that its flavor did not permeate throughout the animal.
<b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda said:</b> That <b>was</b> a case of <b>a kidney</b> of a young goat roasted <b>with its</b> forbidden <b>fat, and</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>permitted it</b> to be eaten because there is a membrane that separates the fat from the kidney and prevents the fat from penetrating the kidney. <b>Ravin bar Rav Adda said:</b> That <b>was</b> a case of a small, non-kosher fish known as <b><i>kilkhit</i>,</b> which fell <b>into a stewpot [<i>ilpas</i>], and they came</b> to <b>ask Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> about its status. <b>And he said to them: Let a gentile cook [<i>kapeila</i>] taste it</b> in order to determine whether the flavor of the non-kosher fish has permeated the entire mixture.
<b>Rava said: Initially that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i> posed <b>a difficulty for me:</b> With regard to <b>a pot in which one cooked meat, one may not cook milk in it; and if he did cook</b> milk in it, the meat absorbed by the pot renders the milk forbidden if it <b>imparts flavor</b> to the milk. Similarly, if one cooked <b><i>teruma</i></b> in a pot, one <b>may not cook non-sacred</b> food <b>in it; and if one did cook</b> non-sacred food in it, the absorbed <i>teruma</i> renders the food in the pot sacred if it <b>imparts flavor</b> to it.
Rava explains: <b>Granted,</b> in the case of a pot used for <b><i>teruma</i>, a priest,</b> who is permitted to partake of <i>teruma</i>, <b>can taste</b> the non-sacred food subsequently cooked in the pot in order to determine whether the <i>teruma</i> imparted flavor to the non-sacred food. <b>But</b> in a case where it is not known whether <b>meat</b> imparted flavor <b>into milk, who can taste it?</b> If the meat did impart flavor to the milk, it would be forbidden for any Jew to consume the milk. But <b>now that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: We rely on a gentile cook</b> in the case of the <i>kilkhit</i>, <b>here also we rely on a gentile cook</b> to taste it and say whether the meat has imparted flavor to the milk.
The Gemara summarizes the guidelines that determine when an item cooked with another item affects the status of the mixture. <b>Rava said: The Sages said</b> that there are cases where one relies <b>on</b> a Jew <b>tasting</b> the food, <b>and the Sages said</b> that there are some cases where one relies <b>on</b> a gentile <b>cook</b> to taste the food,

Daf 97b

<b>and the Sages said</b> that there are cases where the mixture is permitted if there is <b>sixty</b> times as much permitted food as forbidden food. <b>Therefore,</b> in a case where the mixture is <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food <b>not</b> of <b>its</b> own <b>type,</b> so that there is a difference in taste between the two components, <b>when</b> there are Jews for whom the mixture is <b>permitted,</b> one relies <b>on</b> a Jew <b>tasting</b> the mixture. This is the <i>halakha</i> when <i>teruma</i> is cooked with non-sacred food. <b>When</b> the mixture is potentially <b>forbidden,</b> e.g., in the case of meat cooked with milk, one relies <b>on</b> a gentile <b>cook</b> to taste it.
<b>And</b> if the mixture is composed of <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type, where one cannot ascertain</b> whether the forbidden component has imparted <b>flavor; or</b> if it is composed of <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food <b>not</b> of <b>its</b> own <b>type when</b> the mixture may be <b>forbidden</b> and it is a case <b>where there is no</b> gentile <b>cook</b> available to taste it, the mixture is permitted if there is <b>sixty</b> times as much permitted food as forbidden food.
§ The Gemara (96b) cited Shmuel’s opinion with regard to the thigh of an animal that was roasted or cooked with the sciatic nerve still inside. The Gemara relates the following incident: There were <b>those</b> animal <b>thighs that were salted in the home of the Exilarch with the sciatic nerve</b> still inside; <b>Ravina</b> ruled that they were <b>forbidden,</b> whereas <b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Ashi</b> ruled that they were <b>permitted. They came and asked Mar bar Rav Ashi</b> to render a decision. <b>He said to them:</b> My <b>father permitted</b> the meat in such circumstances.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav said to Ravina: What is your reasoning</b> in prohibiting the meat? Is it because of <b>what Shmuel said: A salted</b> food item <b>is</b> considered <b>like a boiling hot</b> food item, and a food item <b>marinated</b> in vinegar, brine, or the like <b>is</b> considered <b>like a cooked</b> food item? Perhaps based on this statement of Shmuel you consider the salted thighs as though they have been cooked with their sciatic nerves, in which case they are forbidden.
<b>But didn’t Shmuel</b> also <b>say</b> (96b): <b>They taught</b> that the thigh is entirely forbidden <b>only when it was cooked</b> with the sciatic nerve <b>inside it. But</b> if the sciatic nerve was <b>roasted inside</b> the thigh, one may <b>peel</b> away the meat <b>and eat</b> it <b>until he reaches the</b> sciatic <b>nerve,</b> and then he removes the nerve.
<b>And if you would say: What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>Like a boiling hot</b> food item, <b>that</b> Shmuel <b>said?</b> It is <b>like boiling hot</b> food <b>that was cooked</b> rather than hot food that was roasted, and therefore if the thigh was salted with its sciatic nerve the entire thigh becomes forbidden. This is not a convincing claim, because <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> Shmuel <b>said:</b> A food item <b>marinated</b> in vinegar, brine, or the like <b>is</b> considered <b>like a cooked</b> food item, it may be understood <b>by inference</b> that <b>when he said</b> that salted food is like <b>boiling hot</b> food he <b>was saying</b> that it is <b>like boiling hot</b> food <b>that is roasted.</b> The Gemara concludes: This poses <b>a difficulty</b> to the opinion of Ravina.
§ The Gemara elaborates on the statement that if permitted and forbidden foods are cooked together and there is sixty times as much permitted food as forbidden food, the mixture is permitted. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: When they assess</b> whether or not there is sixty times as much permitted food, <b>they assess</b> the volume of <b>the broth, the deposits [<i>kifa</i>], the pieces</b> of permitted food cooked in the pot, <b>and the pot</b> itself. The Gemara explains this last point: <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> this means that one includes the volume of the material of <b>the pot itself, and there are</b> those <b>who say</b> it means that one includes the volume of <b>that which the pot has absorbed</b> from the permitted food. When meat cooks its volume decreases, and some of the meat that constitutes that discrepancy is absorbed into the sides of the pot.
The Gemara continues its discussion of nullification. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>all forbidden</b> foods <b>that are</b> prohibited <b>in the Torah,</b> if they are cooked with permitted food and one cannot tell whether they have imparted flavor to the permitted food, <b>we assess</b> the mixture <b>as though</b> the forbidden food were <b>onion or leek [<i>kaflot</i>].</b> If that amount of onions or leeks would impart flavor to the permitted food, one must assume that the mixture is forbidden.
<b>Rabbi Abba said to Abaye: But let one assess</b> the mixture as though the forbidden food were <b>pepper or</b> other <b>spices, which</b> are even more pungent, in which case <b>they</b> would <b>not be nullified even</b> if they were mixed <b>with a thousand</b> times as much permitted food. Abaye <b>said to him: The Sages ascertained that with regard to forbidden</b> foods, <b>there is nothing that imparts more flavor</b> to a mixture <b>than onion and leek.</b>
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the nullification of forbidden foods. <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> A sciatic <b>nerve</b> that was cooked with kosher food is nullified if the mixture contains permitted food that is <b>sixty</b> times the nerve’s volume, <b>and the</b> sciatic <b>nerve</b> itself <b>is not counted</b> in that number, because it cannot nullify itself. If <b>an udder,</b> which is meat but also contains milk, is cooked with other meat, the milk is nullified if the meat is <b>sixty</b> times its volume, <b>and</b> the <b>udder</b> itself <b>is counted</b> with the rest of the meat. If the <b>egg</b> of a non-kosher bird is cooked with kosher food, it is nullified if the permitted food is <b>sixty</b> times its volume, <b>and the egg</b> itself <b>is not counted</b> in that number, as it cannot nullify itself.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak, son of Rav Mesharshiyya, says:</b> In the case of an udder cooked with meat, even if the meat is sixty times the volume of the milk, so that the meat is permitted, the <b>udder itself is forbidden,</b> because the meat imparts flavor to the milk contained within the udder, which then renders the udder forbidden. <b>And if</b> the udder subsequently <b>falls into another pot,</b> it also <b>renders</b> the contents of that pot <b>forbidden</b> unless they are sixty times the volume of the udder.
<b>Rav Ashi said: When we were in the study hall of Rav Kahana, a dilemma was raised before us: When we assess</b> whether the contents of the pot are sufficient to nullify the udder, <b>do we assess</b> whether the pot contains sixty times as much permitted food as the entire volume of the meat of the udder <b>itself, or do we assess</b> only <b>that</b> milk <b>which came out from</b> the udder, since the udder itself has been removed from the mixture?
The Gemara responds: It is <b>obvious that we assess</b> the entire volume of the meat of the udder <b>itself, as if</b> we were to attempt to assess only <b>that which came out of it, how would we know</b> how much came out? The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then if the udder <b>falls into another pot, it should not render</b> the food in that second pot <b>forbidden,</b> because it has been assumed that all the milk in the udder has been released into the first pot.
The Gemara explains: <b>Since Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Mesharshiyya, says</b> that even if there is sixty times as much meat in the pot as there is milk in the udder, <b>the udder itself is forbidden,</b> clearly <b>the Sages equated</b> the udder <b>with a piece of non-kosher</b> meat. Consequently, the reason the udder renders the contents of the second pot forbidden is that the udder is intrinsically forbidden, not because of the milk that is released into the pot while it is being cooked.
§ The Gemara addresses Rav Naḥman’s statement that if the <b>egg</b> of a non-kosher bird is cooked with kosher food, it is nullified if the permitted food is <b>sixty</b> times its volume, <b>and the egg</b> itself <b>is not counted</b> in that number, as it cannot nullify itself. <b>Rav Idi bar Avin said to Abaye:</b> Is this <b>to say that</b> the forbidden egg <b>imparts flavor</b> to the food with which it is cooked? <b>But isn’t</b> it true that when <b>people</b> want to indicate that food is tasteless, they <b>say:</b> This is <b>like mere egg-water?</b> This indicates that an egg does not impart flavor.
Abaye <b>said to him: Here we are dealing with</b>

Daf 98a

<b>an egg</b> that contains <b>a chick,</b> as the chick imparts flavor to the food in which the egg is cooked. <b>But</b> with regard to an egg that does not contain a chick but is from <b>a non-kosher</b> bird, it does <b>not</b> impart flavor to the food with which it is cooked.
Rav Idi bar Avin <b>raised an objection to</b> this answer based on a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 9:5): With regard to <b>kosher eggs that one boiled with non-kosher eggs, if they have</b> a ratio that allows the non-kosher eggs to <b>impart flavor</b> to the kosher eggs, <b>they are all forbidden.</b> This indicates that eggs from non-kosher birds do have flavor. Abaye answered: <b>Here, too</b> it is referring <b>to an egg</b> from a kosher bird that contains <b>a chick. And why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> <b>call this a non-kosher</b> egg, indicating that it is an egg from a non-kosher species? <b>Since it has a chick inside,</b> which causes the egg to be forbidden, the <i>baraita</i> <b>calls it non-kosher.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches:</b> With regard to <b>eggs that one boiled and a chick was found in one of them, if they have</b> a ratio that allows the chick to <b>impart flavor to them, they are all forbidden, it may be inferred that</b> in <b>the first clause we are dealing with</b> an egg <b>that does not have a chick inside.</b>
The Gemara explains that this is an incorrect inference, as the latter clause <b>is explaining</b> the first clause, so that the <i>baraita</i> should be read as follows: With regard to <b>kosher eggs that one boiled with non-kosher eggs, if they have</b> a ratio that allows the non-kosher eggs to <b>impart flavor</b> to the kosher eggs, <b>they are all forbidden. How</b> so? It can be referring to a case <b>where one boiled them and a chick was found in one of them.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>So too it is reasonable</b> to explain the <i>baraita</i> in this manner, <b>as if</b> it would <b>enter your mind</b> to say that <b>the first clause</b> is referring to a case <b>where there is no chick in</b> the egg, the latter clause is redundant: <b>Now</b> that the <i>tanna</i> has taught that in a case <b>where there is no chick inside,</b> the non-kosher egg imparts flavor to the kosher eggs and renders them <b>forbidden, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> to teach that an egg <b>that has a chick inside</b> imparts flavor to the kosher eggs?
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>If it is due to that</b> reason, <b>there is no</b> conclusive <b>argument,</b> i.e., the proof of the argument is inconclusive. The reason is that one can say that the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught the latter clause to reveal</b> the meaning of <b>the first clause.</b> The latter clause was stated so <b>that you would not</b> mistakenly <b>say</b> that <b>the first clause</b> is referring only to a case <b>where</b> the egg <b>has a chick inside, but</b> if <b>there is no chick inside</b> the kosher eggs would be <b>permitted.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches the latter clause</b> and specifies <b>that</b> it is referring to an egg <b>that has a chick inside. By inference the first clause</b> is referring to a case of an egg <b>that does not have a chick inside, and even so it</b> renders all of the other eggs <b>forbidden.</b>
§ The Gemara continues discussing the nullification of forbidden foods. There was once <b>a certain olive-bulk</b> of forbidden <b>fat that fell into a pot of</b> kosher <b>meat. Rav Asi thought to measure</b> the volume of the kosher meat together <b>with that which the pot had absorbed. The Rabbis said to Rav Ashi: Is that to say that</b> the pot <b>absorbed</b> the <b>permitted</b> meat but <b>did not absorb</b> the <b>forbidden</b> fat?
The Gemara relates a similar incident: There was once <b>a certain half-olive-bulk of</b> forbidden <b>fat that fell into a pot of</b> kosher <b>meat. Mar bar Rav Ashi thought to measure</b> the amount of kosher meat needed to nullify the forbidden fat as <b>thirty half-olive-bulks,</b> rather than sixty. <b>His father,</b> Rav Ashi, <b>said to him: Have I not told you: Do not</b> treat <b>measures lightly</b> even with regard to <b>rabbinic</b> prohibitions? <b>And furthermore, didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: A half-measure</b> is <b>prohibited by Torah</b> law? Consequently, the half-olive-bulk of forbidden fat is nullified only in sixty times its volume of permitted meat.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of nullifying forbidden foods. <b>Rav Shemen bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Idi bar Idi bar Gershom says</b> that <b>Levi bar Perata says</b> that <b>Rabbi Naḥum says</b> that <b>Rabbi Biryam says in the name of a certain elder, and his name was Rabbi Ya’akov,</b> that the Sages <b>in the house of the <i>Nasi</i> said:</b> If a non-kosher <b>egg</b> is mixed <b>with</b> kosher eggs, if there are <b>sixty</b> eggs they are all <b>forbidden,</b> but if there are <b>sixty-one</b> eggs they <b>are</b> all <b>permitted.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rav Shemen bar Abba: See,</b> one can infer from your words <b>that you fix a limit</b> to <b>permit</b> the eggs if there is a total of sixty-one eggs, including the non-kosher egg. This is a revelation, <b>because the two</b> most <b>eminent</b> Sages <b>of the generation did not clarify this matter.</b> These two eminent Sages were <b>Rabbi Ya’akov bar Idi and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani,</b> and <b>both of them said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi:</b> In a case where a non-kosher <b>egg</b> is mixed <b>with</b> kosher eggs, if there are <b>sixty</b> eggs they are all <b>forbidden,</b> but if there are <b>sixty-one</b> eggs they <b>are</b> all <b>permitted.</b>
<b>And a dilemma was raised before</b> these Sages: When Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said they are permitted if there are <b>sixty-one</b> eggs, does that mean there are <b>sixty-one</b> eggs altogether, <b>with the</b> non-kosher egg, <b>or</b> does it <b>perhaps</b> mean that there must be sixty-one kosher eggs <b>aside from</b> the non-kosher egg? <b>And</b> they <b>did not resolve</b> this dilemma. <b>And</b> yet, it appears as though <b>the Master,</b> Rav Shemen, has <b>resolved</b> the dilemma, because you implied that the mixture is kosher if there are a total of sixty-one eggs including the non-kosher egg.
The Gemara continues: It <b>was stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If a non-kosher <b>egg</b> becomes mixed <b>with</b> kosher eggs, if there are <b>sixty</b> kosher eggs in addition to <b>that</b> non-kosher egg, the entire mixture is <b>forbidden.</b> But if there are <b>sixty-one</b> kosher eggs in addition to <b>that</b> one non-kosher egg, the mixture is <b>permitted.</b>
§ There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who came before Rabban Gamliel bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi with a half-olive-bulk of non-kosher food that had been mixed with a larger amount of kosher food. Rabban Gamliel <b>said to him:</b> A similar case came before my <b>father,</b> and even though he <b>did not measure</b> the kosher food as being sixty times the volume of the non-kosher food, he nevertheless permitted the mixture due to the fact that there was <b>forty-seven</b> times as much kosher food as non-kosher food. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>I will</b> permit the mixture because I <b>measure</b> that the kosher food is <b>forty-five</b> times the volume of the non-kosher food.
Similarly there was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who came before Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi with a mixture of kosher and non-kosher food. Rabbi Shimon <b>said to him:</b> A similar case came before my <b>father,</b> and even though he <b>did not measure</b> the kosher food as being sixty times the volume of the non-kosher food, he nevertheless permitted the mixture due to the fact that there was <b>forty-five</b> times as much kosher food as non-kosher food. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>I will</b> permit the mixture because I <b>measure</b> that the kosher food is <b>forty-three</b> times the volume of the non-kosher food.
There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who came before Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> with a mixture of kosher and non-kosher food. Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to him: Is there</b> even <b>thirty</b> times the volume of permitted food as forbidden food? Clearly, the mixture is forbidden.
The Gemara seeks to clarify: This indicates that <b>the reason</b> that he prohibited the mixture is <b>that there was not thirty</b> times as much kosher food as non-kosher food. <b>But</b> it may then be inferred that if <b>there is thirty</b> times as much kosher food as non-kosher food, one may <b>assess,</b> i.e., permit, the mixture. And this contradicts the <i>halakha</i> that non-kosher food is nullified only in a mixture containing sixty times as much kosher food as non-kosher food. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya did not make this statement to set a halakhic principle, but merely as <b>an exaggeration.</b> There was not even thirty times the volume of kosher food, so it was obvious that the mixture was forbidden.
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says in the name of bar Kappara: All</b> the <b>forbidden</b> foods <b>in the Torah</b> are nullified when they are mixed <b>with</b> kosher food that is <b>sixty</b> times their volume. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said before</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: <b>My teacher, you say this</b> citing Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, who said that bar Kappara said it. But <b>this is what Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says in the name of bar Kappara: All</b> the <b>forbidden</b> foods <b>in the Torah</b> are nullified when they are mixed <b>with</b> kosher food that is <b>one hundred</b> times their volume.
The Gemara adds: <b>And both of them learned</b> their principles of nullification <b>only from</b> the term: <b>“Cooked foreleg,” as it is written</b> with regard to the nazirite’s ram: <b>“And the priest shall take the cooked foreleg</b> of the ram” (Numbers 6:19). <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“Cooked,”</b>

Daf 98b

and the term <b>“cooked”</b> indicates that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to a foreleg that is <b>whole. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> The term <b>“cooked”</b> indicates that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to a foreleg <b>that is cooked with the</b> entire <b>ram.</b>
The Gemara clarifies their dispute: <b>Everyone</b> agrees that <b>one cooks</b> the foreleg <b>with the</b> rest of the <b>ram.</b> But one <b>Sage holds</b> that one first <b>cuts</b> the foreleg off the animal <b>and then cooks it</b> along with the rest of the animal. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai, <b>holds</b> that one first <b>cooks</b> the entire ram <b>and then cuts</b> off the foreleg.
<b>And if you wish, say that everyone</b> agrees that one first <b>cuts</b> off the foreleg <b>and then cooks it. But</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai, <b>holds</b> that one <b>cooks</b> the foreleg <b>with</b> the rest of <b>the ram, and</b> one <b>Sage holds</b> that he <b>cooks</b> the foreleg <b>in another pot,</b> separate from the rest of the ram.
The foreleg of the nazirite’s ram is permitted to be eaten only by a priest, whereas the rest of the ram is eaten by the nazirite even if he is not a priest. Consequently, <b>according to the first formulation, all agree</b> that the principle of nullification may be derived from here, since all agree that the foreleg is cooked together with the rest of the ram, and yet it does not cause the rest of the ram to be forbidden to a non-priest. <b>According to the latter formulation,</b> the principle of nullification may be derived from here <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai,</b> who says that the foreleg is cooked together with the rest of the ram. But according to the latter formulation the first <i>tanna</i> holds that the foreleg is not cooked with the rest of the ram, in which case the principle of nullification cannot be derived from here.
The Gemara now returns to the dispute about whether non-kosher food is nullified in sixty or one hundred times its volume of kosher food, and explains how each opinion is derived from the <i>halakha</i> of the foreleg of the nazirite’s ram. <b>The one who said</b> that non-kosher food is nullified <b>in sixty</b> times its volume of kosher food <b>holds</b> that <b>we assess</b> the ratio of <b>meat and bones</b> of the foreleg <b>to</b> the <b>meat and bones</b> of the rest of the ram, <b>and this is</b> a ratio of one to <b>sixty. The one who said</b> that non-kosher food is nullified <b>in one hundred</b> times its volume of kosher food <b>holds</b> that <b>we assess</b> only the volume of the <b>meat</b> of the foreleg <b>to</b> the <b>meat</b> of the rest of the ram, <b>and this is</b> a ratio of one <b>to one hundred.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And do we derive</b> the principles of nullification <b>from</b> the case of the nazirite’s ram? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the nazirite’s ram, which absorbs the flavor of the foreleg with which it was cooked: <b>This is</b> a case of <b>permitted</b> meat <b>that comes from the category</b> of <b>forbidden</b> food, i.e., it is permitted despite the fact that it was cooked with forbidden food. The Gemara infers: <b>What</b> does the expression: <b>This is,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> serve <b>to exclude?</b> Does it <b>not</b> serve <b>to exclude all</b> the other <b>forbidden</b> foods <b>that are in the Torah?</b> This indicates that only the cooked foreleg of the nazirite’s ram is nullified in sixty or one hundred times its volume of permitted food, but other prohibited foods are not subject to the principle of nullification.
The Gemara answers that <b>Abaye said:</b> This emphasis <b>is necessary only according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that in general, <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type is not nullified.</b> Therefore the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that here,</b> the flavor imparted by the foreleg to the rest of the nazirite’s ram is <b>nullified.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>Let</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>learn from this</b> case that all forbidden food can be nullified when it is mixed with permitted food of its own type. The Gemara explains: <b>The Merciful One revealed</b> in the Torah: <b>“And he shall take of the blood of the bull and of the blood of the goat</b> and put it upon the corners of the altar round about” (Leviticus 16:18). <b>Both of</b> these two bloods <b>are</b> mixed <b>with each other, and</b> although a bull has more blood than a goat has, the verse makes reference to the blood of the goat, indicating that it maintains its own identity and is <b>not nullified.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>what did you see that</b> caused <b>you</b> to <b>derive</b> a principle <b>from that</b> verse with regard to the blood of the bull and the blood of the goat? <b>Derive</b> a principle <b>from this</b> verse about the foreleg of the nazirite’s ram. The Gemara answers: The case of the nazirite’s ram <b>is a novelty,</b> because even when nullification does apply one may not nullify a forbidden food <i>ab initio</i>, whereas here one is supposed to cook the foreleg together with the rest of the ram; <b>and we do not learn</b> principles <b>from a novelty.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> if Rabbi Yehuda does not consider the case of the nazirite’s ram a viable precedent for general halakhic principles, then <b>let him also not learn</b> from that case that when forbidden food is mixed with permitted food of a different type, it is nullified <b>in</b> either <b>one hundred or sixty</b> times its own volume. As discussed above, the two opinions in this regard are each based on the case of the nazirite’s ram.
The Gemara explains: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>we learn</b> that forbidden food is nullified in sixty or one hundred times its volume of permitted food as <b>a leniency? We learn it</b> only as <b>a stringency, as</b> if it were not for this derivation, we would say that <b>by Torah law</b> forbidden food <b>is nullified in</b> a mixture in which there is a simple <b>majority</b> of permitted food.
<b>Rava stated</b> an alternative explanation of the term: This is, which appears in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to the nazirite’s ram: This limitation <b>is necessary only for</b> the principle that the halakhic status of the <b>flavor</b> of forbidden food is <b>like</b> that of its <b>substance.</b> If the flavor of <b>sacrificial</b> food is absorbed into another food, it renders that food <b>forbidden,</b> i.e., it is not nullified. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that here,</b> in the case of the nazirite’s ram, the rest of the ram is <b>permitted</b> even to non-priests.

Daf 99a

The Gemara objects: <b>Let</b> us <b>learn from</b> the case of the nazirite’s ram that the flavor of sacrificial food can be nullified. The Gemara explains: <b>The Merciful One revealed</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to the sin offering: “Whatever shall touch its flesh shall be holy”</b> (Leviticus 6:20). This teaches that the halakhic status of any food that touches and absorbs flavor from a sin offering <b>becomes like it, so</b> that <b>if</b> the sin offering <b>is disqualified,</b> this food <b>shall</b> also <b>be disqualified, and if</b> the sin offering is <b>valid,</b> this food may be <b>eaten in accordance with the stringencies</b> that apply to a sin offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> to indicate <b>that we learn</b> the principle of nullification concerning sacrificial food <b>from that</b> verse of the sin offering? <b>Derive it</b> instead <b>from this</b> verse concerning the foreleg of the nazirite’s ram. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> case of the nazirite’s ram <b>is a novelty, and we do not learn</b> principles <b>from a novelty.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> if the case of the nazirite’s ram is not a viable precedent for general halakhic principles, then <b>one should also not learn</b> from that case that when forbidden food is mixed with permitted food of a different type, it is nullified in either <b>one hundred or sixty</b> times its own volume. As discussed above, the two opinions in this regard are both based on the case of the nazirite’s ram. The Gemara responds: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>we learn</b> that forbidden food is nullified in sixty or one hundred times its volume of permitted food as <b>a leniency? We learn it</b> only as <b>a stringency, as</b> if it were not for this derivation, one would say that <b>by Torah law</b> forbidden food <b>is nullified in</b> a mixture in which there is a simple <b>majority</b> of permitted food.
<b>Ravina said</b> an alternative explanation of the term: This is, that appears in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to the nazirite’s ram. This limitation <b>is necessary only for the place</b> where the foreleg is <b>cut</b> from the body of the ram, <b>as</b> it was <b>said</b> that in a case where permitted and forbidden foods were attached and one cut the forbidden section from the permitted section, <b>the place of the cut</b> on the permitted part <b>is generally forbidden. But here,</b> in the case of the nazirite’s ram, <b>it is permitted.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to discussing the statement of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak (98a) that forbidden food is nullified in a mixture only if there is one hundred times its volume of permitted food. <b>Rav Dimi sat and said this <i>halakha</i>.</b>
<b>Abaye said to him: And</b> is it true that <b>all the forbidden</b> foods <b>in the Torah</b> that are mixed with permitted foods are nullified only <b>in</b> a mixture containing <b>one hundred</b> times their volume of permitted food? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 2:6): <b>Why did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that with regard to <b>anyone who leavens</b> non-sacred food with a leavening agent that is <i>teruma</i> <b>or flavors</b> it with spices of <i>teruma</i> <b>or mixes</b> <i>teruma</i> into non-sacred food, thereby making the food forbidden for non-priests, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to be stringent</b> if he mixed one <b>type</b> of food that is <i>teruma</i> with non-sacred food of the same <b>type.</b> But the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to be lenient and to be stringent</b> if he mixed one <b>type</b> of <i>teruma</i> with non-sacred food of <b>a different type.</b>
<b>And it is taught in the latter clause,</b> i.e., in the following mishna (<i>Orla</i> 2:7): When it is stated that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to be lenient and to be stringent</b> if he mixed one <b>type</b> of <i>teruma</i> with non-sacred food <b>not</b> of <b>its type, how</b> is this accomplished? For example, in a case of <b>split beans</b> of <i>teruma</i> that were cooked <b>with</b> non-sacred <b>lentils, if there are</b> enough split beans relative to the lentils to <b>impart flavor</b> to the lentils, then regardless of <b>whether there are</b> enough lentils <b>to neutralize</b> the split beans <b>in one hundred and one</b> times their volume, i.e., the volume of the lentils is one hundred and one times the volume of the split beans, or <b>whether there are not</b> enough lentils <b>to neutralize</b> the split beans <b>in one hundred and one</b> times their volume, the entire mixture is <b>forbidden</b> to a non-priest.
Conversely, if <b>there are not</b> enough split beans of <i>teruma</i> to <b>impart flavor</b> to the lentils, then regardless of <b>whether there are</b> enough lentils <b>to neutralize</b> the split beans <b>in one hundred and one</b> times their volume, or <b>whether there are not</b> enough lentils <b>to neutralize</b> the split beans <b>in one hundred and one</b> times their volume, the mixture is <b>permitted</b> even to a non-priest.
Abaye commented: When the mishna says that <b>there are not</b> enough lentils <b>to neutralize</b> the split beans <b>in one hundred and one</b> times their volume, and nevertheless if the split beans did not impart flavor to the lentils, the mixture is permitted, <b>in what</b> amount of lentils are the split beans nullified? Is it <b>not</b> that the split beans are permitted because they are mixed <b>with sixty</b> times their volume of non-sacred lentils? This contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak.

Daf 99b

Rav Dimi answered Abaye: <b>No,</b> the mishna means that although there is not one hundred and one times as much non-sacred food as <i>teruma</i>, the <i>teruma</i> is nullified because there is <b>one hundred</b> times its volume of non-sacred food.
Abaye responded: <b>But since the first clause</b> states that it is nullified <b>in one hundred</b> times its volume, it must <b>be</b> that <b>the latter clause</b> is referring to a case where there is <b>sixty</b> times its volume. <b>As</b> the mishna (<i>Orla</i> 2:6) <b>teaches in the first clause:</b> When it is stated that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to be stringent</b> if one <b>type</b> of <i>teruma</i> is mixed with non-sacred food of <b>its type, how</b> is this accomplished? For example, in a case of <b>leaven of</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>wheat that fell into dough</b> made of non-sacred <b>wheat, and there is enough</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>to cause</b> the non-sacred wheat <b>to become leavened, whether there is</b> enough non-sacred wheat <b>to neutralize</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>in one hundred and one</b> times its volume, or <b>whether there is not</b> enough non-sacred wheat <b>to neutralize</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>in one hundred and one</b> times its volume, the entire dough <b>is forbidden</b> to a non-priest.
But if <b>there is not</b> enough non-sacred wheat <b>to neutralize</b> the <i>teruma</i> <b>in one hundred and one</b> times its volume, then <b>whether there is</b> enough <i>teruma</i> <b>to cause</b> the non-sacred wheat <b>to become leavened</b> or <b>whether there is not</b> enough <i>teruma</i> <b>to cause</b> the non-sacred wheat <b>to become leavened,</b> the entire dough <b>is forbidden</b> to a non-priest. Would you suggest that both <b>the first clause and the latter clause</b> are stating that the <i>teruma</i> is nullified <b>in one hundred</b> times its volume?
Rav Dimi answered: <b>No. The first clause</b> is referring to a case where the <i>teruma</i> is mixed <b>with one hundred and one</b> times its volume of non-sacred food, <b>and the latter clause</b> is referring to a case where the <i>teruma</i> is mixed <b>with one hundred</b> times its volume of non-sacred food.
Abaye asked Rav Dimi: If so, <b>when</b> the mishna states that if <b>there is</b> enough <i>teruma</i> <b>to cause</b> the non-sacred wheat <b>to become leavened</b> the entire mixture is forbidden to non-priests, why is that the case? If leaven is mixed <b>with one hundred and one</b> times its volume of non-sacred wheat it will have no leavening effect, so <b>why is it not nullified?</b> Rav Dimi did not have an answer and <b>was silent.</b>
Abaye <b>said to him: Perhaps leaven is different, because its leavening</b> properties are <b>potent,</b> and there are some forms of leaven that can have an effect on such a large quantity of dough. Rav Dimi <b>said to him: You reminded me</b> of <b>a matter that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: Not all the measures are equal, because the measure</b> required in order to nullify non-kosher fish <b>brine</b> is <b>close to two hundred</b> times its volume. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 10:8): <b>The brine</b> of <b>a non-kosher fish is forbidden. Rabbi Yehuda says: A quarter-</b><i>log</i> of non-kosher fish brine renders kosher food forbidden even if it is mixed <b>with two <i>se’a</i></b> of permitted food, which is one hundred ninety-two times as much as a quarter-<i>log</i>.
The Gemara asks: How can Rabbi Yehuda say that fish brine is nullified at all? <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Yehuda say</b> that <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type is not nullified?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Brine is different because it is merely sweat,</b> i.e., it does not have the halakhic status of the fish itself.
§ The mishna (96b) teaches: <b>How does one measure</b> whether there is enough sciatic nerve to impart flavor to the meat of the entire thigh? One relates to it as though the sciatic nerve were meat and the thigh were a turnip. If the meat would impart flavor to the turnip when they were cooked together, then the entire thigh is forbidden. The Gemara states that <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The mishna means that it is measured <b>like meat</b> cooked in a pot <b>with turnip heads.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> Sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor</b> at all.
There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who came before Rabbi Ḥanina</b> to ask about the status of a thigh of an animal that was cooked with its sciatic nerve, and <b>Rabbi Yehuda bar Zevina was sitting at the gate. When</b> the man <b>left,</b> Rabbi Yehuda bar Zevina <b>said to him: What did</b> Rabbi Ḥanina <b>say to you?</b> The man <b>said to him: He permitted me</b> to eat the thigh.
Rabbi Yehuda bar Zevina <b>said to him: Bring</b> the animal <b>before him again;</b> perhaps he did not fully understand the question. When the man returned to Rabbi Ḥanina, Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said: Who is this</b> person <b>who is bothering me? Go and say to the</b> individual <b>who is sitting at the gate,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda bar Zevina: Sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor.</b> Consequently, he can remove the sciatic nerve and the rest of the meat is permitted.
<b>When</b> people <b>would come before Rabbi Ami</b> to ask about the <i>halakha</i> of a thigh that was cooked with the sciatic nerve inside, he would <b>send them before Rabbi Yitzḥak ben Ḥalov, who</b> would <b>rule</b> leniently <b>about</b> this issue and say that is was <b>permitted, in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi.</b> Rabbi Ami <b>himself did not hold accordingly,</b> but he did not wish to rule stringently for others. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor</b> at all.
§ The mishna states (96b): With regard to <b>a sciatic nerve that was cooked</b> with other sinews, when one identifies the sciatic nerve and removes it, the other sinews are forbidden if the sciatic nerve was large enough to impart flavor. And if he does not identify it, all the sinews are forbidden because each one could be the sciatic nerve. The Gemara challenges: <b>Let</b> the sciatic nerve <b>be nullified by</b> a simple <b>majority.</b>

Daf 100a

The Gemara answers that the sciatic nerve is a distinct <b>entity,</b> and therefore it <b>is different</b> in that it is not subject to nullification.
§ The mishna states: <b>And similarly,</b> in the case of <b>a piece of an animal carcass</b> or a piece of non-kosher fish that was cooked with similar pieces of kosher meat or fish, when one identifies the forbidden piece and removes it, the rest of the meat or fish is forbidden only if the forbidden piece was large enough to impart flavor to the entire mixture. And if he does not identify and remove the forbidden piece, all the pieces are forbidden, due to the possibility that each piece one selects might be the forbidden piece. The Gemara challenges: Even if the piece of an animal carcass was not removed, <b>let</b> it <b>be nullified by</b> a simple <b>majority,</b> as the majority of the pieces are kosher.
The Gemara clarifies its challenge. <b>This</b> ruling <b>works out well according to the one who said</b> that <b>we learned: Any</b> item <b>whose manner is to be counted,</b> i.e., that is sometimes sold by unit rather than by weight or volume, is considered significant and therefore is not subject to nullification. <b>But according to the one who said</b> that <b>we learned:</b> It is only an item <b>whose manner is</b> exclusively <b>to be counted,</b> i.e., that is always sold by unit, that is considered significant, and is therefore not subject to nullification, <b>what can be said?</b> Since pieces of meat or fish are not always sold by unit, they should be subject to nullification. The Gemara answers: <b>A piece</b> of meat or fish <b>is different, since it is suitable to give honor with it</b> by placing it <b>before guests.</b> Therefore, due to its significance it is not subject to nullification.
The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> it was <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach both the <i>halakha</i> that the sciatic nerve is not nullified and the <i>halakha</i> that a piece of non-kosher meat or fish is not nullified, <b>as if</b> the mishna had <b>taught us</b> only the case of a sciatic <b>nerve,</b> one might think that it is not nullified <b>because it is</b> a distinct <b>entity, but</b> in the case of <b>a piece</b> of non-kosher meat, <b>say</b> it is <b>not</b> significant, and it is subject to nullification.
<b>And if</b> the mishna had <b>taught us</b> the <i>halakha</i> only in the case of <b>a piece</b> of non-kosher meat or fish, one might think that it is not nullified <b>since it is suitable to give honor with it</b> by placing it <b>before the guests. But</b> in the case of a sciatic <b>nerve, say</b> it is <b>not</b> significant, and it is subject to nullification. Therefore it was <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach both cases.
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana taught: A piece</b> of meat <b>of an unslaughtered carcass or of a non-kosher</b> species of <b>fish</b> that fell into a pot of kosher food <b>does not render</b> the contents of the pot <b>forbidden unless it imparts flavor to the broth and to the deposits</b> of food remaining in the pot <b>and to the</b> other <b>pieces</b> of food in the pot.
<b>Rav</b> disagreed with Rabba bar bar Ḥana and <b>appointed a disseminator</b> to stand <b>before him</b> and teach his statement to a wider audience, <b>and</b> he <b>taught: Once</b> the non-kosher meat or fish <b>has imparted flavor to</b> another <b>piece</b> in the pot, that second <b>piece itself becomes non-kosher. And</b> this second piece <b>renders all the pieces</b> of meat or fish in the pot <b>forbidden, because they are</b> of the same <b>type;</b> therefore, nullification does not apply.
<b>Rav Safra said to Abaye: Now, in accordance with whose</b> opinion did <b>Rav say his statement?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type is not nullified.</b> But if so, <b>why</b> does Rav state <b>specifically that</b> the non-kosher meat renders all the pieces forbidden only <b>when it</b> has <b>imparted flavor</b> to another piece? <b>Even if it did not impart flavor</b> to another piece it should render all the contents of the pot forbidden. Abaye <b>said to him: Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where he</b> cooked the non-kosher piece with one kosher piece and <b>first removed</b> the non-kosher piece before adding the other pieces. Consequently, the remaining pieces are forbidden only if the non-kosher piece imparted flavor to the piece it was cooked with.
<b>Rava said</b> an alternate answer to Rav Safra’s challenge of Rav’s statement:

Daf 100b

<b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that it is referring to a case where <b>he did not first remove</b> the piece of non-kosher meat or fish. Nevertheless, this <b>is</b> a case of a mixture of one <b>type</b> of food <b>with</b> its <b>own type</b> of food <b>and</b> with <b>something else,</b> i.e., the spices and broth in the pot.
<b>And</b> in <b>any</b> case of <b>a type</b> of forbidden food mixed with <b>its own type</b> of food <b>and</b> with <b>something else, disregard</b> the food that is <b>its own type, as though it is not</b> present in the mixture, <b>and</b> if the amount of permitted food <b>that is not its own type is</b> sixty times <b>greater than</b> the forbidden food, the permitted food <b>nullifies it.</b> Rav’s ruling applies to a case where the forbidden piece of meat or fish imparts flavor to another piece before the spices and broth are added, and there is a total volume sixty times greater than the original non-kosher piece. Consequently, even if the amount of spices and broth is eventually sixty times greater than the original non-kosher piece of meat or fish, the entire mixture is forbidden, as the spices and broth are not sixty times greater than the two pieces of meat or fish which are now non-kosher.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve <b>applies to a kosher</b> animal <b>and does not apply to a non-kosher</b> animal. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It applies <b>even to a non-kosher</b> animal. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> in explanation: <b>Wasn’t the sciatic nerve forbidden for the children of Jacob,</b> as it is written: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve” (Genesis 32:33), <b>yet</b> the meat of <b>a non-kosher animal was still permitted to them?</b> Since the sciatic nerve of non-kosher animals became forbidden at that time, it remains forbidden now. The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda: The prohibition <b>was stated in Sinai, but</b> it <b>was written in its place,</b> in the battle of Jacob and the angel despite the fact that the prohibition did not take effect then.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yehuda hold</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the carcass of a non-kosher bird renders</b> the <b>garments</b> of one who swallows it <b>ritually impure</b> when it is <b>in the throat,</b> similar to the carcass of a kosher bird.
Therefore <b>the verse states</b> concerning the impurity of carcasses of birds: <b>“A carcass, or that which is torn of animals, he shall not eat to defile himself with it”</b> (Leviticus 22:8). The verse indicates that only <b>those</b> birds <b>that are forbidden</b> specifically <b>due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat</b> of <b>a carcass,</b> i.e., kosher birds that died without ritual slaughter, cause impurity in this manner. This serves to <b>exclude</b> any bird <b>that is not forbidden due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat</b> of <b>a carcass,</b> but <b>rather due to</b> the prohibition: <b>You shall not eat a non-kosher</b> bird. This indicates that according to Rabbi Yehuda, the prohibition of eating a carcass does not take effect with regard to a non-kosher bird, because it is already subject to a different prohibition.
The Gemara continues with its question: <b>And if you would say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor,</b> i.e., they do not have flavor and therefore are not classified as food, <b>and even with regard to a non-kosher</b> animal it is prohibited to eat the sciatic nerve because the general <b>prohibition</b> of eating <b>a sciatic nerve applies,</b> whereas the <b>prohibition</b> of eating <b>non-kosher</b> animals <b>does not</b> apply because the sciatic nerve is not considered food, this is untenable.
The Gemara explains: <b>And does Rabbi Yehuda hold</b> that sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who eats the sciatic nerve of a non-kosher animal, Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes, one for eating the sciatic nerve and one for eating the meat of a non-kosher animal, <b>and Rabbi Shimon exempts</b> him entirely from lashes. This indicates that Rabbi Yehuda holds that the sciatic nerve does have flavor.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that sciatic <b>nerves do impart flavor, and he</b> also <b>holds</b> that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve <b>applies to</b> the sciatic nerve of an animal <b>fetus.</b> Consequently, although Rabbi Yehuda holds that a prohibition does not take effect where another already exists, one who eats the sciatic nerve of a non-kosher animal is flogged twice, <b>because the prohibition of</b> eating a sciatic <b>nerve and the prohibition of</b> eating meat from <b>a non-kosher</b> animal <b>come</b> into effect <b>at the same time.</b>
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>And can you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda holds that the prohibition of eating a sciatic nerve <b>applies to</b> the sciatic nerve of <b>a fetus? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (89b): The prohibition <b>applies to</b> a late-term <b>fetus</b> in the womb. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: It does not apply to a fetus, and</b> similarly the <b>fat</b> of a fetus <b>is permitted?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>This statement,</b> that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve does not apply to a fetus, is <b>with regard to a kosher</b> species of animal, <b>because the Merciful One stated</b> in the Torah: “And <b>every</b> animal that divides the hoof, and has the hoof wholly cloven in two, and chews the cud, <b>among the animals [<i>babehema</i>],</b> that <b>you may eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:6). The term <i>babehema</i> may also be translated as: Inside the animals, indicating that anything inside a kosher animal when it is slaughtered is permitted for consumption, including all parts of a fetus. <b>But with regard to a non-kosher</b> species of animal the prohibition <b>applies.</b>
The Gemara challenges the assertion that the prohibitions of eating the sciatic nerve and of eating non-kosher meat take effect at the same time. <b>And can you say</b> that <b>they both come</b> into effect <b>at the same time? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 49b): <b>A nazirite shaves for</b> having become impure from <b>these</b> following sources of <b>ritual impurity: For</b> having become impure with impurity imparted by <b>a corpse; and for</b> impurity imparted by <b>an olive-bulk of a corpse.</b>
<b>And</b> this poses <b>a difficulty for us:</b> If a nazirite <b>shaves for</b> becoming impure from <b>an olive-bulk of a corpse,</b> is it <b>not</b> obvious that <b>all the more so</b> he must shave <b>for</b> becoming impure from <b>an entire corpse? And Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It <b>is necessary only with regard to a miscarried fetus whose limbs have not</b> yet <b>become joined to</b> its <b>sinews.</b> Although the fetus does not yet contain an olive-bulk of flesh, since it is a complete entity, it transmits impurity to anything under the same roof. <b>Evidently,</b> the limbs of the body are formed before the nerves and sinews, and therefore the <b>prohibition of</b> eating <b>non-kosher</b> meat takes effect <b>prior</b> to the prohibition of the sciatic nerve.
The Gemara answers: <b>Even though the prohibition</b> of eating <b>non-kosher</b> meat takes effect <b>prior</b> to the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve, the <b>prohibition of</b> the sciatic <b>nerve</b> also <b>comes and takes effect upon</b> a non-kosher animal <b>because</b> this <b>prohibition applies to descendants of Noah,</b> i.e., to gentiles. Since the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve adds an additional stringency that did not exist with regard to non-kosher meat, it takes effect even though there was an already existing prohibition.
According to this answer, the language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches: Rabbi Yehuda said: Wasn’t the sciatic nerve forbidden for the children of Jacob,</b> as it is written: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve” (Genesis 32:33), <b>yet</b> the meat of <b>a non-kosher animal was still permitted to them?</b> This indicates that the basis of Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is the fact that the sciatic nerve was forbidden to the children of Jacob, who had the status of descendants of Noah.
§ The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> cited above. With regard to <b>one who eats the sciatic nerve of a non-kosher animal, Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes: One for eating the sciatic nerve and one for eating the meat of a non-kosher animal;

Daf 101a

<b>and Rabbi Shimon exempts</b> him entirely.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> according to <b>Rabbi Shimon, whichever way you</b> look at it, it is difficult. <b>If a prohibition takes effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, <b>let</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>deem</b> one <b>liable</b> for eating non-kosher meat and <b>also due to</b> the prohibition of eating the sciatic <b>nerve.</b> Conversely, <b>if a prohibition does not take effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, <b>let</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>deem</b> one <b>liable due to the</b> prohibition of eating meat from <b>a non-kosher</b> species, <b>which preceded</b> the prohibition of the sciatic nerve. <b>And if</b> Rabbi Shimon holds that sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor,</b> and therefore the prohibition of eating non-kosher meat does not apply, <b>let</b> him <b>deem</b> one <b>liable due to</b> the prohibition of eating the sciatic <b>nerve.</b>
<b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>Actually</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>holds</b> that sciatic <b>nerves do not impart flavor,</b> and therefore they are not subject to the prohibition of eating non-kosher meat. <b>And</b> the reason the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerves does not apply to non-kosher animals is that <b>it is different there, because the verse states: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve”</b> (Genesis 32:33). This teaches that the prohibition applies only to a species <b>whose</b> sciatic <b>nerve is forbidden but whose meat is permitted,</b> and <b>excludes this</b> case of a non-kosher animal, <b>whose</b> sciatic <b>nerve</b> would be <b>forbidden and whose meat</b> would also be <b>forbidden.</b>
§ Having discussed the status of the sciatic nerve of a non-kosher animal, the Gemara addresses the status of the sciatic nerve of a kosher animal that did not undergo a proper ritual slaughter. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>one who eats the sciatic nerve of an unslaughtered carcass, Rabbi Meir deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes, <b>and the Rabbis say: He is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes.
<b>And the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Meir</b> in a case <b>where one eats the sciatic nerve of a burnt offering or of an ox that is stoned that he is liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes. The prohibitions concerning a burnt offering and an ox that is stoned are more severe than that of the sciatic nerve, in that it is forbidden to derive any benefit from them, whereas the sciatic nerve is merely forbidden for consumption. Consequently, these prohibitions take effect even with regard to the sciatic nerve, despite the fact that the sciatic nerve was already forbidden before the animal was consecrated or before it gored a person and became liable to be stoned.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And who is this <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>does not hold that in</b> the case of a more <b>inclusive prohibition,</b> the <b>prohibition takes effect where</b> another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, and consequently, according to his opinion the prohibition of eating an unslaughtered animal, which applies to the entire animal, does not take effect with regard to the sciatic nerve. Yet, <b>he</b> does <b>hold</b> that where the second prohibition is both a more <b>inclusive prohibition</b> and a more <b>stringent prohibition,</b> it does take effect, and therefore the prohibition of eating a burnt offering or an ox that is stoned does take effect with regard to the sciatic nerve.
<b>Rava said: It is Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> who holds that a more inclusive prohibition does not take effect where there is an already existing prohibition. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 106a): One who is <b>ritually impure who ate sacrificial</b> food, <b>whether it was ritually impure sacrificial</b> food <b>or ritually pure sacrificial</b> food, is <b>liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> if he did so intentionally and to bring a sliding-scale offering if he did so unwittingly.
<b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: An impure</b> individual <b>who ate pure</b> sacrificial food is <b>liable.</b> But <b>an impure</b> individual <b>who ate impure</b> sacrificial food is <b>exempt, as he merely ate an impure item,</b> and the prohibition of eating sacrificial food while one is impure does not apply to impure sacrificial food.
The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> According to your logic, this <i>halakha</i> would apply <b>even</b> in a case of <b>an impure</b> individual <b>who ate</b> what had been <b>pure</b> sacrificial food, because <b>once he has touched it, he has</b> thereby <b>rendered it impure.</b> Yet, in such a case, he is certainly liable for eating it. So too, an impure individual who ate impure sacrificial food is liable.
The Gemara asks: <b>The Rabbis are saying well to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili;</b> why does Rabbi Yosei HaGelili disagree? <b>And Rava said</b> in elaboration of the dispute: <b>In</b> a case where the person’s <b>body became impure and</b> then <b>afterward</b> the sacrificial <b>meat became impure, everyone agrees that</b> he is <b>liable</b> if he eats the meat, <b>as the prohibition</b> of eating sacrificial meat while impure, which carries the punishment of <b><i>karet</i>, preceded</b> the prohibition of eating impure sacrificial meat.
<b>They disagree when</b> the <b>meat became impure and</b> then <b>afterward the</b> person’s <b>body became impure. The Rabbis hold</b> that a more <b>inclusive prohibition</b> takes effect even where there is an already existing prohibition. Consequently, <b>since</b> the prohibition for an impure person to eat sacrificial meat is more inclusive than the prohibition for a pure person to eat impure sacrificial meat, <b>as</b> an impure person <b>is liable</b> for eating even <b>pure pieces</b> of sacrificial meat that are permitted to the rest <b>of the world, he is also liable</b> for this prohibition when he eats <b>an impure piece</b> of sacrificial meat.
<b>And Rabbi Yosei HaGelili does not</b> accept the principle that a more <b>inclusive prohibition</b> takes effect even where there is an already existing prohibition, <b>as</b> he holds that <b>we do not say that since</b> it applies to cases that were not yet prohibited it applies to all cases.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> even according to <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> HaGelili, <b>granted that he does not</b> hold that a more <b>inclusive prohibition</b> always takes effect where there is an already existing prohibition. But <b>in</b> the case of an already existing <b>lenient prohibition,</b> a more <b>stringent prohibition should come</b> and <b>take effect on</b> the more <b>lenient prohibition. And what is</b> the more stringent prohibition? The prohibition due to the <b>impurity of</b> a person’s <b>body, as</b> one who eats sacrificial food when he has <b>impurity of the body</b> is liable <b>to <i>karet</i>,</b> whereas a pure person who eats impure sacrificial food is merely liable to be flogged. Consequently, the prohibition of eating sacrificial food while impure should apply even though the meat became impure before the person became impure.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Who</b> can <b>say to us that</b> the prohibition due to the <b>impurity of</b> a person’s <b>body is</b> more <b>stringent? Perhaps</b> the prohibition due to the <b>impurity of the meat is</b> more <b>stringent, as</b> impure meat <b>does not have</b> the possibility of restoring its state of <b>purity</b> via immersion <b>in a ritual bath,</b> whereas a ritually impure person can become pure in this manner.

Daf 101b

The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yosei HaGelili not</b> hold that a more <b>inclusive prohibition</b> takes effect where there is an already existing prohibition?
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When <b>Shabbat and Yom Kippur</b> occur on the same day, if one acted <b>unwittingly and performed</b> prohibited <b>labor, from where</b> is it derived <b>that he is liable for this by itself and for that by itself,</b> i.e., he is liable to bring two sin offerings, for having transgressed both Shabbat and Yom Kippur? <b>The verse states:</b> “You shall do no manner of work; <b>it is a Shabbat</b> for the Lord in all your dwellings” (Leviticus 23:3), and another verse states: <b>“It is Yom Kippur”</b> (Leviticus 23:27). The term “it is” in each verse teaches that each of these days is considered independently even when it occurs together with another holy day. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> He <b>is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin offering because a prohibition does not take effect where another prohibition already exists.
The Gemara answers that on this topic <b>Ravin sent</b> a letter citing a statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina: This is the</b> correct <b>presentation of</b> this <b>teaching [<i>hatza’a shel mishna</i>],</b> i.e., the opinions in this <i>baraita</i> are accurate, <b>but</b> one must <b>reverse</b> the attributions of each opinion so that the first opinion is that of Rabbi Akiva and the second opinion is that of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Consequently, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili holds that two prohibitions do not take effect at the same time even if one is more inclusive or stringent than the other.
The Gemara continues to discuss the opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ya’akov bar Giyorei sent</b> a letter citing a statement <b>in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: According to the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, as</b> stated in the <i>baraita</i> once the attributions have been <b>reversed,</b> if one unwittingly performed a forbidden labor on a Yom Kippur that occurred on Shabbat, he is obligated to bring one sin offering. If he acted <b>unwittingly with regard to</b> the fact that it was <b>Shabbat,</b> i.e., he forgot that it was Shabbat, <b>but</b> acted <b>intentionally with regard to Yom Kippur,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to bring a sin offering. But if he acted <b>intentionally with regard to Shabbat but unwittingly with regard to Yom Kippur,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing any offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement? <b>Abaye said: Shabbat is established and permanent,</b> i.e., it always occurs on the seventh day of the week, whereas in the case of <b>Yom Kippur,</b> it is <b>the court that establishes it,</b> as the Sages determine the New Moon. Consequently, Shabbat is considered to have preceded Yom Kippur, and the prohibition to perform labor on Yom Kippur does not apply, due to the fact that labor is already prohibited because it is Shabbat. Since one brings a sin offering only due to unwitting transgression, he is obligated to bring a sin offering only if he performed labor without realizing it was Shabbat.
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>Ultimately both of them,</b> i.e., Shabbat and Yom Kippur, <b>come</b> into effect <b>at the same time.</b> Since both take effect at the beginning of the calendar day, it cannot be said that Shabbat precedes Yom Kippur. <b>Rather Rava said</b> a different explanation. It <b>was</b> a time of religious <b>persecution, and they sent from there,</b> i.e., from Eretz Yisrael, a directive stating <b>that Yom Kippur of this year</b> will not be observed on its proper day but rather on <b>Shabbat.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan was merely stating that on that particular year one who would unwittingly transgress Yom Kippur would be exempt from bringing a sin offering. <b>And similarly, when Ravin and all those who descended</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>came</b> to Babylonia, <b>they said</b> that the true explanation is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> in explanation: <b>Wasn’t</b> the sciatic nerve forbidden for <b>the children of Jacob,</b> as it is written: “Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sciatic nerve” (Genesis 32:33), yet the meat of a non-kosher animal was still permitted to them? Since the sciatic nerve of non-kosher animals became forbidden at that time, it remains forbidden now.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Yehuda: But is it stated</b> in the verse: <b>Therefore the children of Jacob do not eat</b> the sciatic nerve? <b>Isn’t</b> it true that <b>it is stated only</b> that: “Therefore <b>the children of Israel</b> do not eat the sciatic nerve?” <b>And</b> the Jewish people were <b>not called “the children of Israel” until</b> they received the Torah at Mount <b>Sinai. Rather,</b> this terminology indicates that the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve <b>was stated</b> to the Jewish people at Sinai, <b>but was written in its place,</b> after the incident of Jacob wrestling with the angel, to allow the Jewish people <b>to know the reason</b> the sciatic nerve <b>was forbidden to them.</b> Since the prohibition came into effect only at Sinai, there is no proof that it ever applied with regard to non-kosher animals.
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> to this <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And Jacob rose up from Beersheba; <b>and the children of Israel carried Jacob their father,</b> and their little ones, and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him” (Genesis 46:5). This occurred before the Torah was given at Sinai, and therefore proves that the title “the children of Israel” was in use before the Torah was given. The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, this occurred <b>after the incident,</b> i.e., after Jacob wrestled with the angel and after the prophetic vision in which God changed Jacob’s name to Israel (Genesis 35:10).
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> In that case, the sciatic nerve <b>should be</b> understood as having become <b>forbidden</b> to them <b>from that time</b> when they were first called the children of Israel. Since this was before the giving of the Torah, this would be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda and not that of the Rabbis.
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Was the Torah given</b> piecemeal, on numerous different <b>occasions?</b> It was given at Sinai. Rather, <b>that time</b> when the title “children of Israel” was first used <b>was not the time</b> when <b>the incident</b> of Jacob wrestling with the angel occurred <b>and</b> also <b>was not the time of the giving of the Torah</b> at Mount Sinai. Therefore, there is no reason to assume that the prohibition took effect at that time.
§ The mishna taught a dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis with regard to the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve. The Gemara now cites a similar dispute between them with regard to eating a limb from a living animal. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The prohibition of eating <b>a limb from a living animal applies</b> whether the limb comes from <b>a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or a bird,</b> and <b>whether</b> it is from <b>a non-kosher</b> species <b>or</b> from <b>a kosher</b> species; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar. But the Rabbis say:</b> The prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal <b>applies only to</b> a limb from <b>a kosher</b> species.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And both of them,</b> i.e., the Rabbis as well as Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar, <b>derived</b> their opinions <b>from one verse: “Only be steadfast in not eating the blood, for the blood is the life;</b>

Daf 102a

and <b>you shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23). <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar hold</b> that with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose blood you are commanded</b> not to eat, <b>you are commanded with regard to its limbs,</b> i.e., you are prohibited from eating its limbs that were severed while it was still alive. Consequently, with regard to <b>these non-kosher</b> species <b>also, since you are commanded</b> not to eat <b>their blood, you are commanded with regard to their limbs.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that the verse indicates: <b>“And you shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23), but <b>rather</b> you shall eat <b>the flesh alone,</b> i.e., when the animal is no longer alive. Consequently, with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose flesh is permitted</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>you are commanded with regard to its limbs,</b> i.e., you are prohibited from eating its limbs that were severed while it was still alive. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose flesh is not permitted</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>you are not commanded with regard to its limbs,</b> i.e., the prohibition of eating limbs that were severed while it was still alive does not apply.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that a prohibition takes effect upon an already existing, less stringent prohibition, <b>why does he</b> need to derive this from <b>a verse? Let the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal <b>come and take effect on the prohibition</b> of eating meat from <b>a non-kosher</b> animal, as it is more stringent <b>since its prohibition applies</b> also <b>to descendants of Noah,</b> i.e., gentiles.
The Gemara responds: <b>Yes,</b> that <b>is indeed so.</b> Rabbi Yehuda does not need to derive this <i>halakha</i> from a verse, <b>and the verse was necessary</b> only <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who holds that a prohibition does not take effect where there is an already existing prohibition, even if the second prohibition is more stringent.
<b>This</b> fact that it is Rabbi Elazar who derives this <i>halakha</i> from the verse, as opposed to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The prohibition of eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal <b>applies with regard to</b> a limb from <b>a domesticated animal, an undomesticated animal, or a bird,</b> and <b>whether</b> it is from <b>a non-kosher</b> species <b>or a kosher</b> species, <b>as it is stated: “Only be steadfast in not eating the blood,</b> for the blood is the life; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh” (Deuteronomy 12:23).
This verse indicates that with regard to <b>any</b> species <b>whose blood you are commanded</b> not to eat, <b>you are commanded with regard to its limbs,</b> i.e., you are prohibited from eating its limbs that were severed while it was still alive. <b>And any</b> species <b>about whose blood you are not commanded,</b> i.e., with regard to which the prohibition of eating blood does not apply, <b>you are not commanded with regard to their limbs.</b> Since the prohibition of eating blood applies even with regard to non-kosher species, the prohibition of eating limbs severed from a living animal also applies; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal <b>applies only to kosher</b> species, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And you shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23), but <b>rather</b> you shall eat <b>the flesh alone,</b> i.e., when the animal is no longer alive. Consequently, with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose flesh is permitted</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>you are commanded with regard to its limbs,</b> i.e., you are prohibited from eating its limbs that were severed while it was still alive. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose flesh is not permitted</b> when it is slaughtered, <b>you are not commanded with regard to its limbs,</b> i.e., the prohibition of eating limbs that were severed while it was still alive does not apply.
<b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal <b>applies only with regard to a kosher</b> species <b>of domesticated animal,</b> but not with regard to undomesticated animals or fowl, even if they are kosher.
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the different opinions with regard to the name of one of the Sages cited in the upcoming discussion: <b>Shmuel, Sheila, Shimi.</b>
<b>Rabba bar Shmuel said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Yosef</b> who said the following statement. <b>And some say</b> the attributions as follows: <b>Rabba bar Sheila said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Yosef</b> who said; <b>and some say</b> the attributions as follows: <b>Rabba bar Shimi said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Yosef</b> who said: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir</b> that the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal applies only with regard to a kosher species of domesticated animal?
It is that the <b>verse states:</b> “Then <b>you shall slaughter of your cattle and of your sheep”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:21). This verse is closely followed by the verse that serves as the source of the prohibition to eat a limb severed from a living animal (Deuteronomy 12:23), indicating that the prohibition applies only to kosher domesticated animals.
<b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Eliezer about whether the prohibition of eating a limb severed from a living animal applies with regard to non-kosher species is only <b>with regard to Jews. But with regard to descendants of Noah,</b> i.e., gentiles, <b>everyone agrees</b> that they are <b>prohibited from</b> eating a limb from a living <b>non-kosher</b> species of animal just <b>like</b> they are prohibited from eating a limb from a living <b>kosher</b> species.
The Gemara comments that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A descendant of Noah is prohibited</b> from eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal from <b>non-kosher</b> species just <b>as</b> from <b>kosher</b> species. <b>But a Jew is prohibited</b> from eating a limb from a living animal of <b>kosher</b> species <b>only.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the correct wording of the <i>baraita</i> is that a Jew is prohibited from eating a limb from a living <b>kosher</b> species, in singular, <b>and</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that the prohibition is limited to kosher domestic animals. And <b>there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the correct wording of the <i>baraita</i> is that a Jew is prohibited from eating a limb from living <b>kosher</b> species, in plural, <b>and</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that the prohibition also applies to a limb from a living bird or a living undomesticated animal of kosher species.
<b>Rav Sheizvi said: We learn</b> in the mishna <b>as well</b> that a gentile is prohibited from eating a limb from a living being even with regard to non-kosher species (<i>Teharot</i> 1:3): If one <b>ate a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> non-kosher bird, <b>he does not incur forty</b> lashes, <b>and slaughter does not purify it,</b> i.e., cause it to become permitted for consumption.
Rav Sheizvi clarifies: <b>With regard to what</b> case does the mishna issue this ruling? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to a Jew</b> who ate the limb, it is <b>obvious that slaughter does not purify it,</b> because it is a non-kosher species and cannot be made kosher. <b>Rather</b> is it <b>not</b> referring <b>to descendants of Noah</b> and teaching that even after the bird is slaughtered the limb severed while it was alive remains forbidden? <b>By inference,</b> it is clear from the mishna <b>that it is prohibited</b> for a gentile to eat a limb severed from a living being even from a non-kosher species.
<b>Rabbi Mani bar Pattish raises a contradiction</b> between <b>the first clause</b> of that mishna, which states that one does not receive lashes for eating a limb severed from a living non-kosher bird, <b>and the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which states that a limb severed from a living non-kosher bird remains forbidden after the bird is slaughtered. The first clause indicates that the prohibition of eating a limb severed from a living creature applies only to kosher species, while the latter clause indicates that it applies also to non-kosher species. <b>And he answers</b> this contradiction by explaining that <b>the first clause</b> is referring <b>to a Jew and the latter clause</b> is referring <b>to a descendant of Noah.</b>
§ The Gemara continues discussing the prohibition of eating a limb severed from a living creature. <b>Rav says: A limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> animal <b>requires an olive-bulk</b> in order to render one who eats it liable to receive lashes. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is because the term: <b>Eating, is written with regard to</b> the prohibition of a limb severed from a living animal, and the definition of eating is the consumption of at least one olive-bulk.
<b>Rav Amram raises an objection</b> from the mishna cited above (<i>Teharot</i> 1:3): If one <b>ate a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> non-kosher bird, <b>he does not incur the forty</b> lashes, <b>and slaughter does not purify it,</b> i.e., cause it to become permitted. <b>But if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we require an olive-bulk</b> in order for one to receive lashes for eating a limb severed from a living creature, that mishna must be referring to such a case; therefore, it should <b>emerge</b> that he is liable to receive lashes <b>because he ate an olive-bulk</b> of a non-kosher bird.
The Gemara answers: This can be explained <b>as Rav Naḥman said</b> with regard to another issue, that it is referring to a case <b>of</b> eating <b>a small amount of meat</b> together with <b>sinews and bones</b> and the total volume is an olive-bulk. <b>Here also,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>of</b> eating <b>a small amount of meat</b> together with <b>sinews and bones.</b>
The Gemara raises another challenge to Rav’s statement that one receives lashes for eating a limb severed from a living animal only if he eats an olive-bulk: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof in this regard, <b>as Rav said:</b>

Daf 102b

If one <b>ate a kosher bird alive,</b> one is punished with lashes <b>for any amount,</b> i.e., even if he ate less than an olive-bulk. If the bird <b>was dead</b> and was not ritually slaughtered, one is punished with lashes only if he ate <b>an olive-bulk. And</b> if one ate a whole bird of <b>a non-kosher</b> species, <b>whether</b> he ate it <b>when it was alive or dead,</b> he is punished with lashes <b>for any amount,</b> i.e., even if the bird contained less than an olive-bulk of meat. The Gemara answers: <b>Here also</b> explain that Rav’s statement is referring to a case <b>of</b> eating <b>a small amount of meat</b> along with <b>sinews and bones,</b> and the total volume is an olive-bulk.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another challenge based upon a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who <b>took</b> a live <b>bird</b> of a kosher species <b>that did not have</b> a volume of <b>an olive-bulk and ate it, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>exempts</b> him from lashes <b>and Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon deems</b> him <b>liable</b> for lashes. <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, said:</b> He should be liable based upon <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: If one <b>is liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for</b> eating <b>a limb of</b> a living animal, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that one is liable to receive lashes <b>for</b> eating <b>all of it?</b> The <i>baraita</i> concludes: With regard to one who <b>strangled</b> the bird <b>and ate it, everyone agrees</b> that he is liable to receive lashes only if it had the volume <b>of an olive-bulk.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>disagree only with regard to</b> one who ate an entire live bird, <b>as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that even <b>during its life</b> all creatures <b>stand</b> to be divided <b>into limbs,</b> i.e., they will ultimately be cut into pieces. Consequently, each of its limbs is considered a separate entity, and even if one eats a limb without first separating it from the rest of the body, one violates the prohibition of eating a limb from a living being. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that <b>during its life</b> it <b>does not stand</b> to be divided <b>into limbs.</b> Therefore, one does not violate the prohibition of eating a limb from a living being unless he severs a limb from the body.
But <b>in any event, everyone</b> agrees that <b>we do not require</b> one to eat <b>an olive-bulk</b> of meat in order to be liable for lashes for eating a limb from a living being, which is the basis of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> in response: Explain that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> one ate <b>a small amount of meat</b> together with <b>sinews and bones,</b> making a total of an olive-bulk.
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>But is there any</b> bird <b>that does not have an olive-bulk of meat in its whole</b> body, <b>but in one limb it has an olive-bulk</b> of the combination of <b>a small amount of meat</b> together with <b>sinews and bones? Rav Sherevya said: Yes,</b> this is the case <b>with regard to</b> the <b><i>kelanita</i>,</b> a bird that is very small and scrawny.
The Gemara challenges this answer that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a <i>kelanita</i>. <b>Say the latter clause:</b> With regard to one who <b>strangled</b> the bird <b>and ate it, everyone agrees</b> that he is liable to receive lashes only if it had the volume of <b>an olive-bulk. But a <i>kelanita</i> is a non-kosher bird, and Rav says:</b> If one eats a whole <b>non-kosher</b> bird, <b>whether</b> he eats it <b>when it is alive or dead,</b> he is punished with lashes <b>for</b> eating <b>any amount.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is not referring to an actual <i>kelanita</i>, but <b>rather</b> to a kosher species of bird <b>similar</b> to <b>a <i>kelanita</i></b> in that it is small and scrawny.
§ The Gemara above cited a dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, with regard to one who eats an entire live kosher bird that is less than an olive-bulk. With regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that an entire bird is not considered to be a limb and is therefore not included in the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal, <b>Rava said: If you say</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that <b>thought</b> with regard to <b>food is considered thought,</b> i.e., one’s thoughts have halakhic significance in determining a food’s status, then in a case where one <b>thought to eat</b> the bird <b>limb</b> by <b>limb, and</b> instead <b>ate it all</b> at once, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi would hold that he is <b>liable</b> for transgressing the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>But is there anything</b> with regard to which <b>if another</b> person <b>ate it he would not be liable, but</b> if <b>this</b> person <b>ate it he is liable?</b> Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: There can be different outcomes for different people who perform the same act, as <b>this</b> individual’s action is judged <b>according to his thought and that</b> individual’s action is judged <b>according to his thought.</b>
<b>And Rava</b> also <b>said: If you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that <b>thought</b> with regard to <b>food is considered thought,</b> then in a case where one at first <b>intended to eat</b> the entire bird after it had <b>died, but</b> ultimately he <b>ate it alive,</b> Rabbi Elazar bar Rabbi Shimon would hold that he is <b>exempt</b> from lashes, as according to his thought it does not stand to be divided into limbs while alive.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>But is there anything that if another</b> person <b>ate it he would be liable, but if</b> this person <b>ate it he is exempt?</b> Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>This</b> individual’s action is judged <b>according to his thought and that</b> individual’s action is judged <b>according to his thought.</b>
§ The Gemara discusses the source of the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: “You shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibition of eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal. And the verse: <b>“And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibition of eating <b>flesh</b> severed <b>from the living and flesh</b> severed <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> even if it is not an entire limb.
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: “You shall not eat the life with the flesh”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:23); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibitions of eating <b>a limb from a living</b> animal <b>and</b> of eating <b>flesh</b> severed <b>from the living.</b> And the verse: <b>“And you shall not eat any flesh that is torn in the field”</b> (Exodus 22:30); <b>this</b> is the source for the prohibition of eating <b>flesh</b> severed <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the difference between these two opinions. If one <b>ate a limb from a living</b> animal <b>and flesh</b> severed <b>from the living,</b> then <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan he is liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes but <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish he is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes. Conversely, if one <b>ate flesh</b> severed <b>from the living and flesh</b> severed <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> then <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish he is liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes but <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan he is liable to</b> receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes. If one <b>ate a limb from a living</b> animal <b>and flesh</b> severed <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>, everyone agrees</b> that he is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to the claim that everyone agrees that one who eats both a limb from a living animal and flesh severed from a <i>tereifa</i> is liable to receive two sets of lashes, based upon the following statement:

Daf 103a

With regard to one who <b>ate a limb from a living</b> animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes, <b>and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says: He is liable</b> to receive <b>only one</b> set of lashes.
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> this <b>works out well</b> because the prohibitions of eating a limb from a living animal and of eating flesh severed from a <i>tereifa</i> are derived from two different verses. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> it is <b>difficult;</b> why does he hold that the individual receives only one set of lashes?
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here</b> it is referring <b>to one animal,</b> but <b>there</b> it is referring <b>to two animals.</b> Rav Yosef clarifies: <b>In</b> a case of <b>two animals,</b> e.g., where one ate a limb from a living animal and flesh severed from a different animal that was a <i>tereifa</i>, everyone agrees that <b>he is liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes. But <b>in</b> a case where he ate from <b>one animal,</b> e.g., he ate a limb severed from a live <i>tereifa</i> animal, Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>disagree.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to</b> the case of <b>one animal, in what</b> case <b>do they disagree? Abaye said:</b> They disagree, <b>for example,</b> in a case where the animal <b>became a <i>tereifa</i> as the majority of it emerged</b> from its mother’s womb. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>an animal,</b> even <b>during its life, stands to</b> be divided into <b>limbs,</b> and therefore each of its limbs is considered a separate entity; <b>and</b> here <b>the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i> and the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal <b>come</b> into effect <b>at the same time.</b> Consequently, both prohibitions apply.
<b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, <b>holds</b> that <b>during its life an animal does not stand</b> to be divided into <b>limbs.</b> Consequently, although the prohibition of eating a <i>tereifa</i> comes into effect when it is born, the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal does not take effect until the limb is actually severed from the animal, <b>and</b> at that point <b>the prohibition of a limb</b> from a living animal <b>does not come and take effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>during its life an animal does not stand</b> to be divided into <b>limbs, and they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>the prohibition of a limb</b> from a living animal <b>comes and takes effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal, which applies to gentiles as well as to Jews, <b>comes and takes effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i>. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, <b>holds</b> that <b>the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal <b>does not come and take effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>an animal,</b> even <b>during its life, stands to</b> be divided into <b>limbs, and</b> the dispute is about a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>became a <i>tereifa</i> afterward,</b> i.e., after it was born, <b>and they disagree</b> with regard to whether <b>the prohibition of a <i>tereifa</i> comes and takes effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of a limb</b> from a living animal.
One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that the prohibition of eating a <i>tereifa</i> <b>comes and takes effect</b> in addition to the already existing prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, <b>holds</b> that the prohibition of eating a <i>tereifa</i> <b>does not come and take effect</b> in addition to the already existing prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal.
<b>Rava says</b> an alternative explanation: This is referring to a case <b>where he severed a limb from</b> the animal <b>and</b> thereby <b>rendered</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>during its life, an animal does not stand to</b> be divided into <b>limbs.</b> Consequently, <b>the prohibition of a limb</b> from a living animal <b>and the prohibition of a <i>tereifa</i> come</b> into effect <b>at the same time.</b>
<b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, <b>holds</b> that even <b>during its life, an animal stands to</b> be divided into <b>limbs,</b> and therefore the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal takes effect when the animal is born. Consequently, <b>the prohibition of a <i>tereifa</i> does not come and take effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of a limb</b> from a living animal.
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat from a living</b> animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes. <b>Rabbi Ami said to him: But let the Master say</b> that he is liable to <b>three</b> sets of lashes, <b>because I say</b> that the correct version of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is that he is liable to <b>three</b> sets of lashes. It <b>was also stated: Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>ate</b> forbidden <b>fat from a living</b> animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> he is <b>liable</b> to <b>three</b> sets of lashes.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba and Rabbi Ami <b>disagree?</b> They disagree in a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>became a <i>tereifa</i> as the majority of it emerged</b> from its mother’s womb; <b>the one who said</b> that he is liable to <b>three</b> sets of lashes <b>holds</b> that even <b>during its life an animal stands to</b> be divided into <b>limbs,</b> and each of its limbs is considered as a separate entity, <b>so that the prohibition of</b> eating forbidden <b>fat, the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal, <b>and the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i> come</b> into effect <b>at the same time.</b>
<b>And the one who said</b> that he is liable to <b>two</b> sets of lashes <b>holds</b> that <b>during its life, an animal does not stand to</b> be divided into <b>limbs,</b> i.e., its limbs are not considered separate entities while the animal is alive. Consequently, <b>the prohibition of</b> eating forbidden <b>fat and the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> animal <b>apply,</b> as they came into effect at the same time, when the animal was born. By contrast, <b>the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal <b>does not come and take effect,</b> due to the fact that other prohibitions already apply.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>during its life an animal does not stand to</b> be divided into <b>limbs,</b> and each of its limbs is not considered as a separate entity. <b>But they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal <b>comes and takes effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of eating</b> forbidden <b>fat and the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ami, <b>holds</b> that it does <b>come and take effect, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, <b>holds</b> that <b>it does not come and take effect.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>during its life an animal stands to</b> be divided into <b>limbs, and</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>became a <i>tereifa</i> afterward,</b> i.e., after it was born; <b>and they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i> comes and takes effect upon the</b> already existing <b>prohibition of</b> eating <b>a limb</b> from a living animal.
One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ami, <b>holds</b> that it does <b>come and take effect, just as is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with</b> forbidden <b>fat. As the Master said</b> that in the verse: “And the fat of a carcass, and the fat of a <i>tereifa</i> may be used for any other service; but you shall in no way eat of it” (Leviticus 7:24), <b>the Torah said: Let the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a carcass come and take effect upon the prohibition of</b> eating forbidden <b>fat,</b> despite the fact that the prohibition of forbidden fat came into effect first. <b>And</b> similarly, the word “<i>tereifa</i>” teaches: <b>Let the prohibition of</b> eating <b>a <i>tereifa</i> come and take effect upon the prohibition of</b> eating forbidden <b>fat.</b> Consequently, one who eats forbidden fat from a <i>tereifa</i> is liable to receive two sets of lashes. Rabbi Ami holds that just as the prohibition of eating a <i>tereifa</i> takes effect in addition to the prohibition of eating forbidden fat, it also takes effect in addition to the prohibition of eating a limb from a living animal.
<b>And the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, holds <b>that it is</b> only the prohibition of eating forbidden <b>fat for which he is liable</b> in addition to being liable for the prohibition of eating a <i>tereifa</i>. The prohibition of eating a <i>tereifa</i> takes effect in addition to the prohibition of eating forbidden fat <b>because</b> with regard to the latter, there are <b>permitted</b> circumstances that serve as exceptions

Daf 103b

<b>to its general prohibition,</b> as the fat of an undomesticated animal is permitted. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a limb</b> from a living animal, <b>where</b> there are <b>no permitted</b> circumstances to <b>its general prohibition,</b> the prohibition of consuming a <i>tereifa</i> does <b>not</b> take effect.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the prohibition against eating a limb from a living animal. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said: Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish inquired of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If one took from a living animal a limb that was an olive-bulk and <b>divided it</b> into two pieces <b>when it was outside</b> his mouth and ate each piece separately, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> He is <b>exempt.</b>
Reish Lakish then asked Rabbi Yoḥanan: If he placed an olive-bulk of a limb from a living animal <b>inside</b> his mouth and then divided it and swallowed the two parts separately, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes.
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he <b>said</b> an alternative version of this discussion. If one took from a living animal a limb that was an olive-bulk and <b>divided it</b> into two pieces <b>when it was outside</b> his mouth, and he then ate each piece separately, he is <b>exempt.</b> If he divided the limb into two parts <b>inside</b> his mouth, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that he is <b>liable, and Reish Lakish says</b> that he is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> he is <b>liable</b> because his <b>throat derives pleasure from an olive-bulk</b> of a limb from a living animal. <b>And Reish Lakish says</b> that he is <b>exempt</b> because in order to be liable <b>we require</b> an act of <b>eating</b> that contains the requisite amount, i.e., an olive-bulk, when it enters <b>his stomach, and</b> in this case <b>there is not</b> a full olive-bulk that enters his stomach at one time.
The Gemara asks: According to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan it is clear how one can be liable for eating an olive-bulk of a limb from a living animal. <b>But according to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, how can you find</b> a case <b>where</b> one will <b>be liable</b> for eating a limb from a living animal, since the food is generally broken up before he swallows it? <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> One would be liable <b>in</b> a case where he eats <b>a small bone</b> that contains an olive-bulk of meat, bone and sinew all together, and that he can swallow whole.
As quoted above, Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish agree that if one divides a limb from a living animal before placing it in his mouth, he is not liable for eating it. The Gemara adds: <b>But Rabbi Elazar says: Even</b> if one <b>divided</b> the limb <b>outside</b> his mouth he is <b>liable.</b> This is because the fact that the two pieces are <b>lacking</b> in <b>proximity</b> to each other as they are placed in one’s mouth is <b>not comparable to lacking an action,</b> i.e., it is not comparable to a case where he ate only half an olive-bulk. Since he ate an entire olive-bulk, he is liable.
§ The Gemara cites another dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish pertaining to the measure of an olive-bulk with regard to prohibitions involving eating. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> The <b>olive-bulk</b> of <b>which</b> the Sages <b>spoke</b> with regard to prohibitions involving eating is measured by the food one actually swallows, <b>aside from</b> the food that remains stuck <b>between the teeth. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that it includes <b>even</b> the food that remains stuck <b>between the teeth.</b>
In explanation of this dispute, <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> With regard to food <b>that</b> remains stuck <b>between</b> the <b>teeth, everyone agrees</b> that it is not included in measuring an olive-bulk that would render one liable to receive lashes. <b>When they disagree</b> it is with regard to food that remains <b>on the palate,</b> which one tastes but does not swallow. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that since <b>his throat derives pleasure from an olive-bulk,</b> i.e., he tastes the full olive-bulk, he is liable. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Reish Lakish, <b>holds</b> that in order to be liable, <b>we require</b> an act of <b>eating</b> that contains the requisite amount, i.e., an olive-bulk, when it enters <b>his stomach.</b>
§ The Gemara quotes another related ruling of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>ate half an olive-bulk</b> of a forbidden food <b>and vomited it, and then ate another half an olive-bulk,</b> he is <b>liable. What is the reason?</b> It is <b>because his throat derives pleasure from an olive-bulk</b> of the forbidden food, even though the full olive-bulk did not actually enter his stomach.
<b>Rabbi Elazar raised a dilemma before Rabbi Asi:</b> If one <b>ate half an olive-bulk</b> of forbidden food <b>and vomited it, and then ate it</b> again, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the dilemma he is raising? If</b> it is about whether the half-olive-bulk that he ate and vomited up <b>is</b> considered to have been <b>digested,</b> in which case it is no longer considered food, <b>or whether it is not</b> considered to have been <b>digested, let him raise the dilemma</b> with regard to an entire <b>olive-bulk.</b> If one eats an entire olive-bulk and vomits it and then eats it again, if the food is considered not to have been digested the first time, he is liable to be flogged twice.
<b>Rather,</b> his dilemma must be about <b>whether we follow the throat or whether we follow the stomach</b> in measuring how much forbidden food one has swallowed. That being the case, <b>let him resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from</b> that <b>which Rabbi Asi</b> said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said, which indicates that we follow the throat.
The Gemara explains that Rabbi Elazar knew the answer to his question, but <b>Rabbi Asi forgot the statement</b> that he had learned from Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>and Rabbi Elazar came to remind him</b> of what he had known previously. <b>And this is what</b> Rabbi Elazar was <b>saying to him: Why do I</b> need the case where he swallows <b>another half an olive-bulk? Let the Master</b> teach this ruling <b>in</b> a case where he swallows <b>the same</b> half-olive-bulk he had swallowed previously and vomited, <b>as two</b> principles <b>can be derived from</b> the ruling in <b>that</b> case: <b>We</b> can <b>learn from it that</b> the food <b>was not</b> considered to have been <b>digested</b> the first time he swallowed it, <b>and we</b> can <b>learn from it that</b> since <b>his throat derives pleasure from</b> a full <b>olive-bulk,</b> he is liable.
Rabbi Asi <b>was silent and did not say anything.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: Wonder of the generation, did you not say</b> this case <b>many times before Rabbi Yoḥanan, and he said to you:</b> This person is liable <b>because his throat derives pleasure from</b> a full <b>olive-bulk?</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is <b>prohibited to cook any meat</b> of domesticated and undomesticated animals and birds <b>in milk, except for the meat of fish and grasshoppers,</b> whose halakhic status is not that of meat. <b>And</b> likewise, the Sages issued a decree that it is <b>prohibited to place</b> any meat together <b>with</b> milk products, e.g., <b>cheese, on</b> one <b>table.</b> The reason for this prohibition is that one might come to eat them after they absorb substances from each other. This prohibition applies to all types of meat, <b>except for the meat of fish and grasshoppers.</b>

Daf 104a

And <b>one who takes a vow</b> that <b>meat</b> is prohibited to him is <b>permitted to</b> eat <b>the meat of fish and grasshoppers.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Since the mishna does not distinguish between the meat of animals and that of birds, it may <b>consequently</b> be inferred that the meat of <b>birds</b> cooked in milk is <b>prohibited by Torah law,</b> just like the meat of animals. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this ruling? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, as, if</b> you say it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, didn’t he say</b> that the prohibition of the meat of <b>undomesticated animals and birds</b> cooked in milk <b>is not by Torah law?</b>
The Gemara continues: But <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>One who takes a vow</b> that <b>meat</b> is forbidden to him is <b>permitted to</b> eat <b>the meat of fish and grasshoppers.</b> It may <b>consequently</b> be inferred that it is <b>prohibited</b> for him to eat <b>birds.</b> If so, here <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who said: Anything about which an agent</b> sent to purchase a given item <b>would inquire,</b> being unsure whether it qualifies as that type of item, <b>is</b> considered <b>its type.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 54a): <b>One who takes a vow</b> that <b>vegetables</b> are forbidden to him <b>is permitted to</b> eat <b>gourds,</b> as people do not typically consider gourds a type of vegetable, <b>but Rabbi Akiva deems</b> it <b>prohibited</b> for him to eat gourds. The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Akiva: But</b> it is a common occurrence that <b>a person says to his agent: Purchase vegetables for us, and</b> the agent, after failing to find vegetables, returns and <b>says: I found only gourds.</b> This indicates that gourds are not considered vegetables.
Rabbi Akiva <b>said to them: The matter is so,</b> and that proves that my opinion is correct. <b>Does</b> the agent return and <b>say: I found only legumes? Rather,</b> it is evident <b>that gourds are included in</b> the category of <b>vegetables,</b> although they differ from other vegetables, and therefore, the agent explains that he found only gourds, and asks whether he should purchase them. <b>But legumes are not included in</b> the category of <b>vegetables,</b> and that is why an agent would not even ask about them. Therefore, Rabbi Akiva should also hold that one who takes a vow that meat is forbidden to him is prohibited from eating birds. And if so, <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Akiva, <b>and the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> That is not difficult. The entire mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and he formulates</b> the mishna <b>according to</b> the opinions of different <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> In the latter clause, <b>with regard to vows, he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> whereas in the first clause, <b>with regard to meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> a different explanation: <b>The entire</b> mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> as indicated by the latter clause, concerning vows. <b>And</b> as for the first part of the mishna, <b>this</b> is what it <b>is saying:</b> It is <b>prohibited to cook any meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, some</b> types <b>of</b> meat <b>by Torah law,</b> i.e., that of domesticated animals, <b>and some</b> types <b>of</b> meat <b>by rabbinic law,</b> i.e., that of undomesticated animals and birds. This prohibition applies to all types of meat <b>except for the meat of fish and grasshoppers, which are</b> not prohibited, <b>neither by Torah law nor by rabbinic law.</b>
§ The mishna teaches further: <b>And</b> it is <b>prohibited to place</b> any meat with cheese on one table. <b>Rav Yosef said: Conclude from</b> this clause that eating the <b>meat of birds</b> cooked <b>in milk</b> is prohibited <b>by Torah law. As, if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> that the prohibition against eating it applies merely <b>by rabbinic law,</b> this would be because the <b>consumption</b> of the meat of birds cooked in milk is <b>itself</b> a rabbinic <b>decree,</b> lest one come to eat the meat of an animal in milk. <b>And</b> would <b>we decree</b> against <b>placing</b> birds together with cheese on one table <b>due to</b> the possibility of <b>consumption,</b> which is itself a decree? The Sages do not enact one decree to prevent the violation of another decree.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do you say that we do not issue</b> one rabbinic <b>decree to</b> prevent violation of another rabbinic <b>decree?</b> The source is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥalla</i> 4:8): <b><i>Ḥalla</i> from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, which must be eaten by a priest,

Daf 104b

<b>may be eaten with a non-priest</b> present <b>at the</b> same <b>table.</b> The Sages did not issue a decree prohibiting this lest the non-priest partake of the <i>ḥalla</i>, as the separation of <i>ḥalla</i> outside of Eretz Yisrael is itself a rabbinic decree. This proves that the Sages do not issue one decree to prevent violation of another decree. <b>And</b> similarly, <i>ḥalla</i> from outside of Eretz Yisrael <b>may be given to any priest that</b> one <b>wishes,</b> even an uneducated priest who would not guard its state of ritual purity. This is in contrast to <i>ḥalla</i> from Eretz Yisrael, which may be given only to priests who observe the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Granted,</b> your inference would be valid <b>if</b> the mishna in tractate <i>Ḥalla</i> had <b>taught us</b> this with regard to <b><i>ḥalla</i> from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael that had been brought <b>into Eretz</b> Yisrael. <b>As</b> in that case, <b>there</b> could be reason <b>to decree</b> against eating it while a non-priest is at the same table, despite the fact that the non-priest eating it is prohibited only by rabbinic law, <b>due to</b> the concern that one might come to eat <b><i>ḥalla</i> from Eretz</b> Yisrael, which is prohibited to the non-priest <b>by Torah law,</b> at the same table as a non-priest; <b>and</b> yet <b>we do not decree</b> against this practice. If so, <b>there</b> would be grounds <b>to learn from</b> this mishna that the Sages do not issue one decree to prevent violation of another decree.
<b>But</b> the mishna actually teaches this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <i>ḥalla</i> from <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael that remains there. It therefore proves nothing about compound decrees, as it can be claimed that the practice <b>is</b> permitted only <b>because there is no</b> reason <b>to decree.</b> Since by Torah law the obligation of <i>ḥalla</i> does not apply outside of Eretz Yisrael, there is no chance that such behavior will lead to transgression of Torah law. <b>But here, if you permit one to place</b> the meat of <b>birds and cheese</b> on the same table, some might <b>come to place</b> the <b>meat</b> of domesticated animals <b>and cheese</b> on a single table <b>and</b> to <b>eat</b> this <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk,</b> thereby transgressing a prohibition <b>by Torah law.</b>
<b>Rav Sheshet objects to</b> the premise of Rav Yosef’s inference: Even if one were to posit that the meat of birds in milk is prohibited by Torah law, <b>ultimately</b> this is still a decree issued due to another decree, as <b>it is</b> a case of <b>cold</b> food <b>in</b> another <b>cold</b> food, consumption of which is itself prohibited by rabbinic law. <b>Abaye said:</b> It is a rabbinic <b>decree, lest one place</b> the meat with cheese <b>in a boiling stewpot,</b> which is a manner of cooking and therefore prohibited by Torah law.
The Gemara counters: <b>Ultimately,</b> even a stewpot is only <b>a secondary vessel,</b> i.e., not the vessel that was on the fire, <b>and</b> as a rule, <b>a secondary vessel does not cook. Rather,</b> one must say that it is a rabbinic <b>decree, lest one place</b> the meat with cheese <b>in a stewpot</b> that is <b>a primary</b> vessel, i.e., that was on the fire. This is certainly cooking meat in milk, and it is prohibited by Torah law.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The</b> meat of <b>birds may be placed with cheese on</b> one <b>table but</b> may <b>not be eaten</b> together with it; this is <b>the statement of Beit Shammai. And Beit Hillel say:</b> It may <b>neither be placed</b> on one table <b>nor be eaten</b> with cheese. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: This is</b> one <b>of the</b> disputes involving <b>leniencies of Beit Shammai and stringencies of Beit Hillel.</b>
The mishna elaborates: <b>With regard to which table</b> are these <i>halakhot</i> <b>stated?</b> It is <b>with regard to a table upon which one eats. But on a table upon which one prepares the cooked food, one</b> may <b>place this</b> meat <b>alongside that</b> cheese or vice versa, <b>and</b> need <b>not be concerned</b> that perhaps they will be mixed and one will come to eat them together.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara challenges: The opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei is</b> identical to that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>. And if you would say</b> that there <b>is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the permissibility of <b>eating itself, as the first <i>tanna</i> says</b> that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>disagree with regard to placing</b> meat of birds with cheese on one table, which indicates that <b>with regard to eating they do not disagree, and Rabbi Yosei said</b> in response <b>to</b> this that they also disagree with regard to the permissibility of <b>eating</b> meat of birds in milk, and this is <b>itself</b> one <b>of the</b> disputes involving <b>leniencies of Beit Shammai and stringencies of Beit Hillel,</b> one can refute this claim.
The refutation is as follows: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <b>six matters</b> are included <b>as the</b> disputes involving <b>leniencies of Beit Shammai and stringencies of Beit Hillel, and this is one of them:</b> The meat of <b>birds is placed with cheese on</b> one <b>table, but</b> it may <b>not be eaten</b> together with it; this is <b>the statement of Beit Shammai. And Beit Hillel say:</b> It may <b>neither be placed</b> on one table <b>nor be eaten</b> with cheese. Evidently, Rabbi Yosei agrees that even according to Beit Shammai the meat of birds may not be eaten with cheese.
<b>Rather, this</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us: Who is the first <i>tanna</i>?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> The identification is important, since <b>whoever reports a statement in the name of the one who said it brings redemption to the world. As it is stated</b> with respect to the incident of Bigthan and Teresh: <b>“And Esther reported it to the king in the name of Mordecai”</b> (Esther 2:22), and Mordecai was later rewarded for saving the king’s life, paving the way for the miraculous salvation.
§ The Gemara continues discussing the consumption of poultry cooked in milk. The Sage <b>Agra, the father-in-law of Rabbi Abba, taught:</b> The meat of <b>birds and cheese may be eaten freely</b> [<b><i>apikoren</i></b>], i.e., there is no need to be strict in this matter. The Gemara notes: <b>He,</b> Agra, <b>teaches it and he says it,</b> i.e., explains his statement: The meat of birds and cheese may be eaten <b>without washing</b> one’s <b>hands and without wiping the mouth</b> between the consumption of each.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Mesharshiyya, happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Rav Ashi. They brought him cheese,</b> and <b>he ate</b> it. Next <b>they brought him meat,</b> and <b>he ate</b> it <b>without</b> first <b>washing his hands.</b> The members of Rav Ashi’s household <b>said to him: But didn’t Agra, the father-in-law of Rabbi Abba, teach</b> only that the meat of <b>birds and cheese may be eaten freely?</b> One can infer that with regard to the meat of <b>birds and cheese, yes,</b> one may eat them without washing one’s hands in between, but with regard to the <b>meat</b> of domesticated animals <b>and cheese, no,</b> one may not.
Rav Yitzḥak <b>said to them: This statement</b> of Agra applies only if one eats them <b>at night,</b> as one cannot see whether some of the food of the previous dish still remains on his hands, and he must therefore wash them. <b>But</b> if one eats <b>by day, I</b> can <b>see</b> that no food remains on his hands, and consequently there is no need to wash them.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai say:</b> Between the consumption of meat and milk one must <b>wipe</b> out his mouth, <b>and Beit Hillel say</b> that he must <b>rinse</b> his mouth. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word: <b>Wipe [<i>mekane’aḥ</i>], and what</b> is the meaning of the word: <b>Rinse [<i>mediaḥ</i>]?</b>

Daf 105a

<b>If we say</b> that <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that one <b>wipes</b> out his mouth with solid food <b>and does not need</b> to <b>rinse</b> his mouth with water, since they maintain that wiping is more effective than rinsing, <b>and Beit Hillel say</b> that he <b>rinses</b> his mouth in water <b>and does not need</b> to <b>wipe</b> his mouth, as rinsing is more effective, one can respond: <b>But</b> as for <b>that which Rabbi Zeira said: Wiping of</b> the <b>mouth</b> can be performed <b>only with bread, in accordance with whose</b> opinion is it? It is apparently <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> since Beit Hillel do not require wiping. Yet, it is unlikely that Rabbi Zeira would rule in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai rather than Beit Hillel.
<b>Rather,</b> one must explain the dispute as follows: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that one <b>wipes</b> his mouth after eating meat <b>and does not need</b> to <b>rinse</b> his mouth as well, <b>and Beit Hillel say</b> that in addition to wiping one must <b>also rinse.</b> This interpretation is difficult as well, since if so, this <b>constitutes</b> one <b>of the</b> disputes between them that involve <b>leniencies of Beit Shammai and stringencies of Beit Hillel, and</b> consequently, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of tractate <i>Eduyyot</i> <b>teach it alongside</b> the other disputes listed there that involve <b>leniencies of Beit Shammai and stringencies of Beit Hillel.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> one must interpret their statements as follows: <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that one <b>wipes</b> his mouth after eating meat, <b>and the same is true of rinsing,</b> i.e., one must rinse his mouth as well. <b>And Beit Hillel say</b> that one <b>rinses</b> his mouth, <b>and the same is true of wiping.</b> And <b>one Sage said one</b> statement <b>and one Sage said another</b> statement, <b>and they do not disagree.</b>
§ After citing Rabbi Zeira’s statement tangentially, the Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi Zeira says: Wiping of the mouth</b> can be performed <b>only with bread.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>And this statement</b> applies only <b>to</b> bread prepared <b>from wheat</b> flour. <b>But with regard to</b> bread prepared <b>from barley</b> flour, one may <b>not</b> use it for wiping, as barley bread crumbles in the mouth and does not wipe thoroughly.
The Gemara adds: <b>And even</b> in the case of bread prepared <b>from wheat</b> flour, <b>we said</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>only with regard to cold</b> bread, <b>but</b> as <b>for warm</b> bread, it is ineffective for wiping even if made of wheat, as it softens and <b>sticks</b> to the palate, and it does not wipe the mouth properly. <b>And</b> furthermore, even if the bread is cold, <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>with regard to soft</b> bread, <b>but</b> one may <b>not</b> wipe <b>with hard</b> bread, as it also does not clean effectively. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that the use <b>of all items constitutes</b> effective <b>wiping, except for flour, dates, and vegetables.</b>
§ <b>Rav Asi posed a dilemma to Rabbi Yoḥanan: How much</b> time <b>should one wait between</b> eating <b>meat and</b> eating <b>cheese?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: No</b> time <b>at all.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rav Ḥisda say:</b> If one <b>ate meat,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for him <b>to eat cheese</b> immediately, but if he ate <b>cheese</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for him <b>to eat meat</b> without delay? <b>Rather,</b> Rav Asi actually asked Rabbi Yoḥanan the following question: <b>How much</b> time <b>should one wait between</b> eating <b>cheese and</b> eating <b>meat?</b> In response to this question, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: No</b> time <b>at all.</b>
After tangentially citing a statement of Rav Ḥisda, the Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav Ḥisda says:</b> If one <b>ate meat,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for him <b>to eat cheese</b> immediately, as the meat contains fatty substances that stick to one’s mouth and preserve the flavor of meat. But if he ate <b>cheese</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for him <b>to eat meat</b> without delay. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yosef said to Rav Ḥisda:</b> In the case of <b>meat that is between the teeth, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Are these remnants considered meat to the extent that one may not eat cheese as long as they are in his mouth?
In response, Rav Ḥisda <b>read about him</b> the following verse: <b>“While the meat was yet between their teeth”</b> (Numbers 11:33). This verse indicates that even when the meat is between one’s teeth it is still considered meat, and therefore one may not partake of cheese until that meat has been removed.
<b>Mar Ukva said: I am, with regard to this matter,</b> like <b>vinegar, son of wine, with respect to Father,</b> i.e., my practice is inferior to that of my father. <b>As Father, if he were to eat meat at this time, would not eat cheese until tomorrow at this time. But as for me,</b> only <b>at this meal,</b> during which I ate meat, <b>do I not eat</b> cheese; <b>at a different meal</b> on the same day <b>I</b> will <b>eat</b> cheese.
Similarly, <b>Shmuel said: I am, with regard to this</b> other <b>matter,</b> like <b>vinegar, son of wine, with respect to Father. As Father would patrol his property</b> to examine it <b>twice daily, but I patrol</b> it <b>only once</b> a day. The Gemara notes: In this regard <b>Shmuel</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Shmuel said: One who patrols his property every day will find an <i>asteira</i></b> coin.
The Gemara relates that <b>Abaye would patrol his property each and every day. One day he encountered his sharecropper carrying a load of wood</b> that the sharecropper intended to take for himself. Abaye <b>said to him: To where</b> are you taking <b>these</b> logs of wood? The sharecropper <b>said to him: To the Master’s house.</b> Abaye, who knew that the sharecropper had intended to take the wood for himself, <b>said to him: The Sages already preempted you</b> when they said that one should patrol his property regularly, and they thereby prevented you from stealing the wood.
The Gemara likewise relates that <b>Rav Asi would patrol his property every day. He said: Where are all these <i>asteira</i></b> coins mentioned <b>by Mar Shmuel?</b> This patrol is not reaping me any benefit. <b>One day he saw</b> a water <b>channel that overflowed,</b> causing water to flood <b>onto his land. He took off his cloak, wrapped it, and placed it inside</b> the pipe to block the flow of water. <b>He</b> then <b>raised</b> his <b>voice,</b> and <b>people came</b> and <b>sealed</b> the hole. He said: <b>I have</b> just <b>found all the <i>asteira</i></b> coins mentioned <b>by Mar Shmuel,</b> as I would have suffered a great loss had I not patrolled my fields.
§ Having mentioned the manner of washing hands during a meal, the Gemara discusses another matter concerning washing hands. <b>Rav Idi bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan says:</b> The <b>first waters,</b> i.e., washing of the hands before eating bread, are <b>a mitzva</b> by rabbinic law, <b>but</b> the <b>final</b> waters, washing of the hands upon conclusion of the meal and before reciting Grace after Meals, are <b>an obligation,</b> a more stringent requirement.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this ruling from a <i>baraita</i>: The <b>first waters and</b> the <b>final</b> waters are <b>an obligation,</b> whereas the <b>middle</b> waters, between courses during the meal, are <b>optional.</b> Apparently, the first waters are also an obligation, not a mitzva. The Gemara responds: Although the first waters are in fact a mitzva, the <i>tanna</i> <b>calls a mitzva an obligation</b> when <b>compared to an optional</b> requirement.
The Gemara analyzes <b>the</b> matter <b>itself.</b> The full text of the <i>baraita</i> is as follows: <b>First waters and final</b> waters are <b>an obligation,</b> whereas <b>middle</b> waters are <b>optional.</b> For <b>first</b> waters, <b>one may wash either</b> by spilling the water <b>into a vessel or onto the ground.</b> But for <b>final</b> waters, <b>one washes only</b> by pouring the water <b>into a vessel. And some say</b> a slightly different version of the <i>baraita</i>: For final waters, <b>one may not wash</b> by pouring the water <b>onto the ground.</b>
The Gemara interjects: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> these two versions? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to pouring the water on thin wood <b>slivers</b> on the ground. According to the first version, which requires that the water be poured into a vessel, one may not use such slivers for this purpose, whereas according to the second version, which merely prohibits pouring the water onto the ground, one may use wood slivers.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>first waters, one may wash either with hot</b> water <b>or with cold</b> water. But for <b>final</b> waters, <b>one may wash only with cold</b> water, <b>because hot</b> water <b>softens the hands and does not remove the dirt</b> from them. The Gemara analyzes the statement that for <b>first waters one may wash either with hot</b> water <b>or with cold</b> water: <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where the hand does not</b>

Daf 105b

<b>recoil [<i>soledet</i>] from</b> the water’s heat. <b>But</b> if <b>the hand recoils from it, one may not wash with it.</b>
<b>And there are those who teach</b> a version of <b>this</b> statement <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: For <b>final</b> waters, <b>one may wash only with cold</b> water, <b>but</b> one may <b>not</b> wash <b>with hot</b> water. <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai says: They taught</b> that one may not use hot water <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the water is so hot that <b>the hand recoils from it, but if the hand does not recoil from it, one may wash</b> with it. The Gemara comments: One can learn <b>by inference</b> from this version of the statement <b>that</b> in the case of <b>first</b> waters, <b>even if</b> the water is so hot that <b>the hand recoils from it,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> to use it for washing.
§ The <i>baraita</i> states that <b>middle</b> waters are <b>optional. Rav Naḥman says: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to washing the hands <b>between</b> one <b>cooked dish and</b> another <b>cooked dish</b> served at a meal. <b>But between a cooked dish and cheese</b> there is <b>an obligation</b> to wash one’s hands.
§ The <i>baraita</i> further teaches that final waters are an obligation. <b>Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: For what</b> reason did the Sages <b>say that final waters are an obligation?</b> It is <b>because Sodomite salt is</b> sometimes <b>present,</b> a small amount of <b>which blinds the eyes.</b> Since Sodomite salt could remain on one’s hands, one must wash them after eating. <b>Abaye said: And</b> this type of dangerous salt <b>is present</b> in the proportion of <b>a pinch</b> [<b><i>korta</i></b>] <b>in</b> an entire <b><i>kor</i></b>  of regular salt. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> If one <b>measured salt</b> between meals, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Must he wash his hands afterward? <b>He said to him: It is not necessary</b> to say this; he is certainly obligated to do so.
§ <b>Abaye said: At first I would say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that one may not wash</b> his hands with <b>final waters over the ground</b> is <b>due to messiness.</b> But the <b>Master,</b> Rabba, <b>said to me</b> that it is <b>because an evil spirit rests upon</b> the water and passersby are liable to be afflicted.
<b>And Abaye</b> also <b>said: At first I would say</b> that the reason for <b>this</b> statement of the Sages <b>that one should not take anything from the table when a person is holding a cup to drink,</b> is <b>lest a mishap occur at the meal,</b> i.e., the one holding the cup might have wanted the item that was taken, and since he is unable to speak he will choke in his anger. But <b>the Master</b> subsequently <b>said to me</b> that it is <b>because it is bad for</b> one’s health, causing <b>a spirit of</b> pain in <b>half</b> his head, i.e., a migraine.
<b>And we said</b> that this practice is prohibited <b>only if one takes</b> an item from the table <b>and does not put</b> it <b>back. But</b> as for <b>taking and putting back, we have no</b> problem <b>with it. And</b> likewise, <b>we said</b> it is prohibited <b>only</b> if one takes the item <b>beyond four cubits</b> of the table. <b>But</b> if one leaves it <b>within four cubits, we have no</b> problem <b>with it. And</b> furthermore, <b>we said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to <b>an item that is necessary for the meal. But</b> in the case of <b>an item that is not necessary for the meal, we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>
The Gemara relates that <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi was particular</b> not to remove any object from the table when someone was holding his cup in hand, <b>even with regard to a mortar [<i>asita</i>] and pestle [<i>bukhna</i>] for spices,</b> like all <b>items that are necessary for the meal.</b>
<b>And Abaye</b> further <b>said: At first I would say</b> that <b>this</b> practice <b>that</b> people <b>collect the crumbs</b> of bread after a meal is <b>due to cleanliness.</b> But <b>the Master</b> subsequently <b>said to me</b> that it is <b>because</b> leaving them <b>is bad for,</b> i.e., it can increase, a person’s vulnerability to <b>poverty.</b>
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who was pursued by the ministering angel of poverty, but</b> the angel <b>was unable to</b> impoverish <b>him, as he was exceptionally careful with regard to crumbs. One day</b> that man <b>broke</b> his <b>bread over grass,</b> and some crumbs fell among the blades of grass. The angel <b>said: Now he will certainly fall into my hands,</b> as he cannot collect all the crumbs. <b>After</b> the man <b>ate, he brought a hoe, uprooted the grass,</b> and <b>threw it into the river.</b> He subsequently <b>heard</b> the ministering angel of poverty <b>say: Woe</b> is me, <b>as that man has removed me from my house,</b> i.e., my position of comfort.
<b>And Abaye said: At first I would say</b> that <b>this</b> practice <b>that</b> people <b>do not drink the foam</b> from the top of a beverage is followed <b>because</b> it is <b>repulsive.</b> But <b>the Master said to me</b> that it is followed <b>because it is bad for</b> one’s vulnerability to <b>catarrh.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Drinking it is bad for catarrh,</b> while <b>blowing</b> off the foam from the drink <b>is bad for head</b> pains, and <b>removing it</b> with one’s hand <b>is bad for poverty.</b> If so, <b>what is its remedy?</b> How may one drink? He <b>should sink</b> the foam inside the beverage and then drink it.
The Gemara notes: The treatment <b>for catarrh</b> caused by the foam <b>of wine</b> is <b>beer;</b> the treatment for catarrh caused by the foam <b>of beer</b> is <b>water;</b> and for catarrh caused by the foam <b>of water there is no remedy. And this</b> is in accordance with the adage <b>that people say: Poverty follows the poor.</b> Not only does a pauper have nothing to drink other than water, but there also is no treatment for the disease caused by his beverage.
<b>And Abaye said: At first I would say</b> that the reason for <b>this</b> practice <b>that</b> people <b>do not eat vegetables from a bundle tied by the gardener</b> is <b>because it has the appearance of gluttony,</b> as he does not wait to untie the bundle to eat. But <b>the Master said to me</b> that it is <b>because</b> it <b>is bad for</b> one’s vulnerability to <b>witchcraft.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna were traveling on a boat. A certain matron said to them: Seat me together with you</b> on the boat, but <b>they did not seat her</b> alongside them. <b>She said something,</b> an incantation, and thereby <b>tied the boat</b> to its spot so that it could not move. <b>They</b> too <b>said something and</b> thereby <b>released it.</b> That matron <b>said to them: What can I do to you?</b> Witchcraft has no power over you, <b>as</b> after attending to your bodily functions, <b>you do not wipe yourselves with an earthenware shard, and you do not kill a louse</b> that you find <b>on your garments, and you do not eat vegetables from a bundle tied by the gardener.</b>
<b>And Abaye said: At first I would say</b> as follows: The reason for <b>this</b> practice <b>that</b> people <b>do not eat vegetables that fell on the table</b> is <b>because</b> it is <b>replusive.</b> But <b>the Master said to me</b> that it is <b>because it is bad for halitosis. And Abaye said: At first I would say</b> that the reason for <b>this</b> practice <b>that</b> people <b>do not sit under a gutter</b> is <b>because</b> of the <b>waste water</b> that pours out of it. But <b>the Master said to me</b> that it is <b>because demons are</b> commonly <b>found</b> there.
The Gemara relates: There were <b>certain porters who were carrying a barrel of wine.</b> When <b>they wanted to rest, they placed it under a gutter</b> and the barrel <b>burst. They came before Mar bar Rav Ashi,</b> who <b>brought out horns and</b> had them blown as he <b>excommunicated</b> the demon of that place. The demon <b>came before</b> Mar bar Rav Ashi, and the Sage <b>said to it: Why did you do this?</b> The demon <b>said to him: How</b> else <b>should I act, when</b> these men <b>place</b> a barrel <b>on my ear?</b>
Mar bar Rav Ashi <b>said to it: What are you doing in a place where many</b> people <b>are found? You are the one who deviated</b> from the norm; <b>go</b> and <b>pay</b> them the value of the barrel of wine. The demon <b>said to him: Let the Master now set a time for me,</b> so that I can find the money, <b>and I will pay.</b> Mar bar Rav Ashi <b>set a time for</b> his payment. <b>When</b> that <b>time arrived,</b> the demon <b>delayed</b> in coming to pay. <b>When</b> the demon eventually <b>came,</b> Mar bar Rav Ashi <b>said to it: Why did you not come at</b> the <b>time</b> set for <b>you?</b> The demon <b>said to him:</b> With regard to <b>any item that is tied up, or sealed, or measured, or counted, we have no authority to take it.</b> We are unable to obtain money <b>until we find an ownerless item.</b> For this reason, it took him a long time to find enough money to pay for the barrel.
<b>And Abaye said: At first I would say</b> that <b>this</b> practice <b>that</b> people <b>pour out</b> a little <b>water from the mouth of a pitcher</b> before drinking from it is followed <b>because of twigs</b> it might contain. But <b>the Master said to me</b> that it is followed <b>because there are foul waters</b> in the pitcher.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain son of a demon that was in Rav Pappa’s house</b> as a servant. It <b>went to bring water from the river,</b> and <b>it delayed</b> in returning. <b>When it came,</b> the members of Rav Pappa’s household <b>said to it: Why did you delay? It said to them:</b> I waited <b>until the foul waters passed. In the meantime,</b>

Daf 106a

the demon <b>saw</b> the members of Rav Pappa’s household <b>pouring water from the mouth of the pitcher</b> before drinking from it. The demon <b>said</b> to them: <b>If I had known that you regularly do this, I would not have delayed.</b> I would have brought the water straight from the river, knowing you would pour out the foul waters.
§ <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said:</b> Due to the failure to wash with <b>the first waters,</b> they ultimately <b>fed</b> a Jew <b>pig meat.</b> This case involved a storekeeper who would sell different meat to his Jewish and gentile customers. When a Jew who came to eat with him neglected to wash before eating, the storekeeper assumed he was a gentile and fed him pig meat.
And due to the failure to wash with <b>final</b> waters <b>a woman</b> was ultimately <b>divorced from her husband.</b> In this incident, a host who had stolen his guests’ money had lentils on his mustache from a previous meal because he had not washed his hands and mouth after eating. Realizing he had eaten lentils that day, his victims approached the man’s wife and said that her husband had instructed them to tell her to return their money. They then claimed that the man told them to tell her that he had eaten lentils that day as proof that they were telling the truth. They thereby fooled his wife into thinking he wanted her to give their money back. Out of anger, the host divorced his wife.
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said</b> the statement slightly differently: Due to the failure to wash with <b>first</b> waters, they <b>fed</b> a Jew meat from <b>an animal carcass,</b> and the failure to wash with <b>final</b> waters <b>killed a person,</b> as in the second incident the host was so angry with his wife that he killed her. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: And your mnemonic</b> to remember which Sage said which version is: <b>Rav Dimi came</b> and <b>divorced her</b> from her husband, i.e., according to his version she was divorced, and <b>Ravin came</b> and <b>killed her,</b> since in his version the husband killed his wife.
<b>Rabbi Abba would teach one of these</b> versions involving first waters <b>and one of them</b> with regard to final waters, and in both cases he taught <b>the more severe</b> version, i.e., he specified the meat of a pig and that the husband killed his wife.
A disagreement <b>was stated</b> with regard to <b>water heated by fire: Ḥizkiyya says</b> that <b>one may not wash</b> his <b>hands with</b> such water, <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>one may wash</b> his <b>hands with it. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I asked Rabban Gamliel, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, about this <i>halakha</i>, <b>and</b> he was one who would <b>eat</b> only in a state of <b>ritual purity</b> and was therefore careful about washing his hands; <b>and he said to me</b> that <b>all the great men of the Galilee would do so,</b> i.e., wash their hands in heated water.
Likewise, with regard to <b>the hot springs of Tiberias, Ḥizkiyya says</b> that <b>one may not wash</b> his <b>hands with</b> water from them before eating, <b>but</b> if there are forty <i>se’a</i>, the requisite size of a ritual bath, then <b>one may immerse the hands</b> directly <b>in them,</b> and this is effective for the ritual of washing the hands before a meal. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that an impure person <b>may immerse his entire body in</b> such water to become pure, <b>but</b> one may still <b>not</b> use it for the immersion of part of his body, such as <b>his face, hands, and feet,</b> as this immersion is not considered equivalent to washing the hands.
The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that it has been said that one <b>may immerse his entire body in</b> the hot springs of Tiberias, is it <b>not all the more so</b> permitted for <b>his face, hands, and feet? Rav Pappa said:</b> When the water in the hot springs stands <b>in place, everyone,</b> both Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>agrees that it is permitted</b> to immerse one’s hands in it. Likewise, <b>everyone agrees that</b> to <b>take from</b> these waters <b>in a vessel</b> and wash one’s hands from it <b>is prohibited. They disagree when one draws</b> the waters <b>through a ditch.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>we decree</b> against the use of <b>ditch</b> water <b>due to</b> the concern that one might come to use water in <b>a vessel, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Ḥizkiyya, <b>holds</b> that <b>we do not decree</b> against it.
The Gemara comments: This dispute is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it was taught: When <b>water that has ceased to be fit for drinking</b> even <b>by an animal</b> is <b>in vessels,</b> it is <b>unfit</b> for washing the hands, but when it is <b>in the ground</b> it is <b>fit</b> for immersion, like a ritual bath. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Even</b> when the water is <b>in the ground,</b> one <b>may immerse his entire body in it, but</b> he may <b>not</b> immerse <b>his face, hands, and feet.</b>
As above, one might ask: <b>Now</b> that one <b>may immerse his entire body in</b> the water, is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case that one may immerse <b>his hands and feet</b> in it? <b>Rather,</b> must it <b>not</b> be referring to a case <b>when one draws</b> the waters <b>through a ditch? And</b> if so, <b>they disagree about this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, <b>holds</b> that <b>we decree</b> against the use of <b>ditch</b> water <b>due to</b> concern that one may come to use <b>a vessel, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i> of that <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>we do not decree</b> against it.
§ <b>Rav Idi bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashiyan says:</b> The obligation of <b>washing hands</b> before eating <b>non-sacred</b> food is <b>due to an ancillary</b> decree on account of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of produce designated for the priest, which must be consumed in a state of ritual purity. By rabbinic decree, one’s hands are considered impure with second-degree ritual impurity, as they may have touched impure items. Therefore, they render <i>teruma</i> impure. Consequently, priests who partake of <i>teruma</i> are obligated to wash their hands first. The Sages therefore decreed that all must wash their hands even before eating non-sacred food, so that people not become accustomed to eating without washing their hands, which would in turn lead the priests to partake of <i>teruma</i> without washing their hands.
<b>And</b> the obligation is <b>further due to</b> its being <b>a mitzva.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What mitzva</b> does it involve? <b>Abaye says:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to listen to</b> and obey <b>the statements of the Sages,</b> who instituted this washing of the hands. <b>Rava says:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to listen to the statement of Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh, as it is written</b> with regard to a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>]: <b>“And whomever he that has the issue touches, without having rinsed his hands in water,”</b> he contracts ritual impurity (Leviticus 15:11), and <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Arakh says: From here the Sages based washing of the hands</b> upon a verse <b>from the Torah.</b>
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: From where</b> is this <b>inferred?</b> How can this verse, which concerns a <i>zav</i>, be interpreted as referring to washing the hands before a meal? Rava explains: <b>As it is written: “Without having rinsed his hands in water.” Consequently,</b> one could infer that if he <b>rinsed</b> his hands the <i>zav</i> becomes <b>ritually pure. But</b> this cannot be correct, as verses elsewhere prove that a <i>zav</i> <b>requires</b> the <b>immersion</b> of his entire body. <b>Rather, this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: And</b> there is <b>another</b> type of person <b>who,</b> if he <b>has not rinsed</b> his hands in water, is considered like one who is <b>impure.</b> The verse thereby serves as the basis for washing the hands.
<b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>washing of the hands</b> before eating <b>fruit</b> is mandatory <b>only due to cleanliness.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>They understood from this</b> statement that <b>there is no</b> true <b>obligation</b> to wash the hands before eating fruit, <b>but there is a mitzva</b> to do so. <b>Rava said to them:</b> This practice is <b>not an obligation nor a mitzva, but</b> merely <b>optional. And</b> the Gemara notes that Rava <b>disagrees with Rav Naḥman</b> in this regard, <b>as Rav Naḥman said: One who washes his hands</b> before eating <b>fruit is nothing other than</b> one <b>of the arrogant,</b> i.e., it is actually prohibited to do so.
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: I was standing before Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> when attendants <b>brought a basket of fruit before them, and they ate and did not wash their hands. And they did not give me anything</b> to eat, to enable me to join the <i>zimmun</i>, the quorum required for communal Grace after Meals, <b>and they each recited a blessing</b> after eating, <b>separately.</b> One may <b>learn three</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from</b> this incident. <b>Learn from it</b> that <b>there is no washing of the hands</b> before <b>fruit. And learn from it</b> that <b>one does not issue a <i>zimmun</i> on fruit,</b> i.e., the <i>halakha</i> that when three people eat together, one leads the Grace after Meals does not apply when they ate fruit. <b>And</b> finally, <b>learn from it</b> that if only <b>two</b> people <b>ate,</b> it is <b>a mitzva</b> for them <b>to separate,</b> i.e., each should recite the blessing after eating for himself.
The Gemara notes: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If only <b>two</b> individuals <b>ate,</b> it is <b>a mitzva</b> for them <b>to separate. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>when they were both scribes,</b> i.e., Torah scholars, who know how to recite Grace after Meals properly. <b>But</b> if <b>one</b> of them was <b>a scribe and one</b> was <b>an ignoramus,</b> the <b>scribe recites Grace</b> after Meals <b>and</b> the <b>ignoramus fulfills</b> his obligation by listening to the scribe.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In <b>washing of the hands for</b> consumption of <b>non-sacred</b> food, one must pour the water on the area that extends <b>until the joint</b> of the fingers. In washing hands <b>for</b> consumption of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b>

Daf 106b

he must pour on the area extending <b>until the joint.</b> In <b>sanctifying the hands and feet in the Temple</b> before the service, he must pour the water <b>until</b> another <b>joint,</b> where the palm meets the wrist. <b>And any item that</b> is considered to <b>interpose</b> between one’s skin and the water <b>with regard to immersion of the body</b> in a ritual bath, disqualifying the immersion, likewise <b>interposes with regard to washing the hands for</b> eating <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>and with regard to sanctification of the hands and feet in the Temple.</b>
<b>Rav said</b> this <i>halakha</i> to his students while indicating with his hand the joints to which the <i>baraita</i> is referring: One washes <b>until here,</b> the second joint of the fingers, <b>for non-sacred</b> food, and <b>until there,</b> the third joint, where the fingers join the palm, <b>for <i>teruma</i>. And Shmuel</b> disagreed and <b>said:</b> One washes <b>until here both for</b> eating <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>and for <i>teruma</i>,</b> indicating <b>the more stringent</b> location, the third joint where the fingers join the palm. <b>And Rav Sheshet said: Until here both for</b> the consumption of <b>non-sacred</b> food <b>and for <i>teruma</i>,</b> indicating <b>the more lenient</b> location, the second joint.
<b>Bar Hedya said: I was standing before Rabbi Ami, and he said:</b> One washes <b>until here both for non-sacred</b> food <b>and for <i>teruma</i>,</b> indicating <b>the more stringent</b> location, the third joint. <b>And do not say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami</b> acted this way only <b>because he is a priest</b> and acted stringently to avoid confusing <i>teruma</i> and non-sacred food. This cannot be, <b>as Rabbi Meyasha, son of the son of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, is a Levite, and</b> yet <b>he</b> too <b>said: Until here both for non-sacred</b> food <b>and for <i>teruma</i>,</b> indicating <b>the more stringent</b> location.
§ <b>Rav says: A person may wash both</b> of <b>his hands in the morning and stipulate with regard to them</b> that he may eat on the basis of that washing throughout <b>the entire day,</b> provided he guards his hands from dirt and ritual impurity. It is likewise related that <b>Rabbi Avina said to the inhabitants of</b>

Daf 107a

<b>the valley of Aravot [<i>pakta da’aravot</i>],</b> where there was a shortage of water: People <b>such as you, for whom water is scarce,</b> should <b>wash your hands in the morning and stipulate with regard to them for the entire day. Some say</b> that Rabbi Avina maintains that <b>in exigent circumstances, yes,</b> one should act in this manner, but when one is <b>not in exigent circumstances,</b> he should <b>not</b> do so. <b>And</b> according to this explanation, Rabbi Avina <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> who permitted this practice to all. <b>And some say</b> that Rabbi Avina ruled that one may do so <b>even</b> when <b>not in exigent circumstances, and</b> Rabbi Avina’s opinion <b>is</b> identical to that <b>of Rav.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> With regard to <b>this irrigation channel [<i>arita dedalla’ei</i>],</b> into which water is poured from a river using buckets, and which then transports the water to the fields, <b>one may not wash</b> his <b>hands in</b> it. The reason is that this water <b>does not come from a person’s force,</b> i.e., it is not poured on the hands by a direct act, as it moves by force of the current in the channel. <b>But if one draws his hands near the bucket</b> itself, in such a manner <b>that</b> the water poured on his hands <b>comes from a person’s force</b> before it begins to flow in the channel, then <b>one may wash</b> his <b>hands with it.</b>
<b>And if the bucket</b> in which the water is drawn from the river <b>is perforated</b> with a hole large enough <b>to enable liquid to enter</b> the vessel when it is placed in the river, the presence of this hole <b>connects</b> the water in the channel to the water in the river, as they touch through that hole. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>one may immerse</b> his <b>hands in</b> that channel as he would in the river itself. Yet the perforated bucket is invalid for the washing of the hands by pouring, since it is no longer considered a vessel. As <b>Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a vessel that is perforated</b> with a hole large enough <b>to enable liquid to enter, one may not wash</b> his <b>hands with it.</b>
<b>And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a vessel that does not have a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> of water <b>in it, one may not wash</b> his <b>hands with it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rava say:</b> With regard to <b>a vessel that cannot contain a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> of water, <b>one may not wash</b> his <b>hands with it.</b> It may be <b>consequently</b> inferred that as long as the vessel <b>can contain</b> a quarter-<i>log</i>, one may use it <b>even if it does not</b> currently <b>have</b> a quarter-<i>log</i> <b>in it.</b>
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; this</b> former statement, requiring a quarter-<i>log</i> of actual water, is referring to washing <b>for one</b> person, whereas <b>that</b> latter statement, requiring only that the vessel have a capacity of a quarter-<i>log</i>, is referring to washing <b>for two</b> people. If a vessel originally contained a quarter-<i>log</i> of water, then even if less than that amount remains after one person has washed his hands, a second individual may use the remainder, which is considered fit based on the water’s original volume. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of water, one may wash the hands of one</b> individual, <b>and even</b> those <b>of two.</b>
<b>Rav Sheshet said to Ameimar: Are you particular about the vessel</b> used for washing hands, that it be wholly intact? Ameimar <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rav Sheshet further inquired: Are you also particular <b>about the appearance</b> of the water, that it be normal? Ameimar again <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rav Sheshet further asked: Are you particular <b>about the measure</b> of water, that it be no less than one quarter-<i>log</i>? Ameimar <b>said to him: Yes.</b>
<b>Some say</b> that <b>this</b> is what Ameimar <b>said to him: We are particular about</b> the wholeness of <b>the vessel and about</b> the water’s <b>appearance,</b> but <b>we are not particular about</b> the water’s <b>measure, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of water one may wash the hands of one</b> individual, <b>and even</b> those <b>of two.</b> The <i>baraita</i> indicates that there is no need for a quarter-<i>log</i> for each individual.
The Gemara notes: <b>And it is not so,</b> i.e., one cannot derive from the <i>baraita</i> that the measure of water is immaterial. <b>It is different there because</b> there the water <b>comes from the remainder of</b> a measure initially sufficient for <b>purity.</b> If there was not initially a quarter-<i>log</i>, the water is unfit for even one person.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ya’akov from Nehar Pekod prepared a glass vessel that could contain a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> of water for washing his hands. <b>Rav Ashi in Huzal</b> likewise <b>prepared an earthenware vessel that could contain a quarter</b>-<i>log</i>.
<b>And Rava says:</b> If <b>one prepared the stopper of a barrel</b> for use as a vessel by hollowing it out until it contained a quarter-<i>log</i>, <b>one may wash</b> his <b>hands with it,</b> even though it was not originally designated for this function. <b>This</b> ruling <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one prepared the stopper of a barrel</b> for this purpose, <b>one may wash</b> his <b>hands with it.</b> Likewise, with regard to <b>a <i>ḥemet</i> and a <i>kefisha</i>,</b> types of leather wineskins, <b>that one prepared</b> for this purpose, <b>one may wash</b> his <b>hands with them,</b> as they were initially designed to hold liquids. But with regard to <b>a sack and a basket, even if they can contain</b> water, <b>one may not wash</b> his <b>hands with them,</b> as no sack or basket is designed to hold water, and most cannot.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to eating with a cloth [<i>mappa</i>]</b> on one’s hands, rather than washing them to purify them? <b>Are we concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> he will <b>touch</b> the food with his hands, <b>or not?</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a mishna (<i>Sukka</i> 26b): <b>And when they gave Rabbi Tzadok</b> on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>less than an egg-bulk of food, he took</b> the food <b>in a cloth, and he ate it outside the <i>sukka</i>,</b> as he held one is not obligated to eat food of this amount in a <i>sukka</i>. <b>And he did not recite a blessing after</b> eating <b>it,</b> since less than an egg-bulk does not satisfy the verse: “And you shall eat and be satisfied and bless the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10). <b>What, is it not</b> to be inferred that <b>consequently,</b> if one eats <b>an egg-bulk,</b> it <b>requires washing of the hands,</b> even if one uses a cloth?
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps</b> one can conclude from that mishna only that <b>consequently,</b> if one eats <b>an egg-bulk</b> he <b>needs</b> to do so in <b>a <i>sukka</i> and needs</b> to recite <b>a blessing</b> after eating; but he can still use a cloth instead of washing his hands.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from an incident <b>where Shmuel found Rav eating with a cloth</b> rather than washing his hands, and Shmuel <b>said to him:</b>

Daf 107b

<b>Do we act in this manner?</b> Rav <b>said to</b> Shmuel: I did wash my hands, but as <b>I am delicate</b> I do not wish to hold food in my bare hands; therefore I covered them with a cloth.
The Gemara further relates: <b>When Rabbi Zeira left</b> Babylonia for Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi eating</b> bread while covering their hands <b>with worn</b> pieces of <b>wineskins,</b> rather than washing them. Rabbi Zeira <b>said</b> to them: Could <b>two great men such as yourselves err with regard to</b> the incident of <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> related above? After all, Rav <b>said</b> to Shmuel: I am using a cloth because <b>I am delicate;</b> he did wash his hands beforehand.
The Gemara notes: <b>It escaped</b> Rabbi Zeira’s <b>mind that Rav Taḥlifa bar Avimi said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> The Sages <b>permitted</b> the consumption of bread while the hands are wrapped with <b>a cloth</b> rather than washed, specifically <b>to</b> priests <b>who partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> as they are careful not to touch the bread with their hands. <b>But they did not permit</b> the use of <b>a cloth</b> in this manner <b>to</b> non-priests, even those <b>who</b> are particular to <b>eat</b> non-sacred food in a state of <b>ritual purity,</b> as they do not maintain the same level of diligence as priests. <b>And</b> since <b>Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi were priests,</b> it was permitted for them to eat with a cloth.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one <b>eats by means of</b> another <b>feeding</b> him, without himself touching the food, does he <b>need to wash hands</b> before eating <b>or not?</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the following incident <b>where Rav Huna bar Seḥora was standing before Rav Hamnuna</b> and serving him. Rav Huna bar Seḥora <b>cut a slice of meat for</b> Rav Hamnuna and placed it in his mouth, <b>and he ate</b> it. Rav Huna bar Seḥora <b>said to</b> Rav Hamnuna: <b>Were you not Rav Hamnuna, I would not feed you</b> in this fashion.
The Gemara infers from this episode: <b>What is the reason</b> that it was permitted for Rav Hamnuna to eat in such a manner? Is it <b>not because he was careful not to touch</b> the food with his hands? This indicates that someone may be fed even without washing his hands. The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> one can say <b>that he was vigilant</b> and <b>went ahead and washed his hands at the outset.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from that <b>which Rabbi Zeira said</b> that <b>Rav said: A person may not place a slice</b> of bread <b>into the mouth of</b> the <b>attendant</b> serving at a meal <b>unless he knows that he has washed his hands. And</b> it was also stated that <b>the attendant recites a blessing over each and every cup</b> of wine presented to him at a meal. This is because he never knows if he will receive another cup, and he cannot intend that his initial blessing apply to a cup he does not know he will receive. <b>But</b> he <b>does not recite a blessing over each and every slice</b> of bread given to him. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that he must <b>recite a blessing over each and every slice</b> he receives.
<b>Rav Pappa said: Granted,</b> the apparent contradiction between the opinions <b>of Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is <b>not difficult;</b> one can resolve it by saying that <b>this</b> statement of Rav, that the attendant need not recite a blessing for every slice of bread, is referring to a case <b>where there is an important person</b> at the meal. Since the attendant is confident that the important person will ensure the attendant receives enough to eat, his initial blessing applies to each slice he receives. And <b>that</b> statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring to a meal <b>where there is no important person.</b> Since the attendant is not confident that he will receive another slice, he must recite a new blessing whenever he does receive one.
<b>In any case,</b> Rav first <b>says</b> that one should not place a slice into the attendant’s mouth <b>unless he knows that he has washed his hands.</b> This indicates that one who is fed by another must wash his hands. The Gemara responds: The case of <b>an attendant is different, as</b> he <b>is occupied</b> with his duties and may touch the food inadvertently. Therefore, he specifically may not eat without washing his hands.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person</b> who is a guest <b>may not give a slice</b> of bread from the meal in front of him <b>to the attendant</b> serving, <b>whether a cup is in</b> the attendant’s <b>hand or a cup is in the host’s hand, lest a mishap occur at the meal.</b> The host might become angry or distracted by the concern that there will not remain enough food for his guests, and the cup will fall from his hand. If the cup is in the attendant’s hand, he might drop it while accepting food from the guest. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>an attendant who has not washed his hands,</b> it <b>is prohibited to place a slice</b> of bread <b>into his mouth.</b>
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Does one who feeds</b> another <b>need to wash</b> his <b>hands,</b> since his hands are touching the food? <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>he does not need</b> to wash his hands, as he himself is not eating.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from <b>that</b> which <b>the school of Menashe taught</b> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: A woman may rinse one hand in water</b> on Yom Kippur, so that she does not touch food before she has washed her hands in the morning, <b>and give bread to her minor son,</b> without concern about violating the prohibition against bathing on Yom Kippur. <b>They said about Shammai the Elder that he did not want to feed</b> his children <b>with</b> even <b>one hand</b> on Yom Kippur, to avoid having to wash it. <b>But</b> due to concerns about the health and well-being of his children, <b>they decreed that he must feed</b> them <b>with two hands,</b> forcing him to wash both. Apparently one who feeds another must wash his hands, even though he himself is not eating.
<b>Abaye said:</b> The reason for the washing <b>there</b> is not on account of the food specifically. Rather, it is <b>due to</b> an evil spirit named <b>Shivta,</b> who contaminates hands that have not been washed in the morning. As long as one washes his hands in the morning, perhaps he need not wash them again to feed another.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from the following incident, <b>as Shmuel’s father found</b> the young <b>Shmuel crying,</b> and <b>said to him: Why are you crying?</b> Shmuel replied: <b>Because my teacher struck me.</b> His father asked: <b>Why</b> did he strike you? Shmuel responded: My teacher <b>said to me: You are feeding my son, but you did not wash your hands.</b> His father asked: <b>And why did you not wash</b> your hands? Shmuel <b>said to him:</b> Only <b>he,</b> the teacher’s son, <b>is eating, and I</b> must <b>wash my hands?</b>
Shmuel’s father <b>said to him: Is it not enough that</b> your teacher <b>did not learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> properly, <b>that he even strikes you</b> on account of his error? One who feeds another need not wash his hands if he himself is not eating. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that one who <b>eats by means of</b> another <b>feeding</b> him <b>needs to wash</b> his <b>hands,</b> even though he does not touch the food. But <b>one who feeds</b> another <b>does not need to wash</b> his <b>hands.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person may bind meat and cheese in one cloth, provided that they do not come into contact with each other. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Two</b> unacquainted <b>guests [<i>akhsena’in</i>] may eat</b> together <b>on one table, this</b> one eating <b>meat and that</b> one eating <b>cheese, and they</b> need <b>not be concerned</b> lest they come to violate the prohibition of eating meat and milk by partaking of the food of the other.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one may bind meat and cheese together in one cloth, provided that they do not come into contact with each other. The Gemara asks: <b>And if they come into contact with each other, what of it? It is</b> a case of one <b>cold</b> food <b>in</b> contact with another <b>cold</b> food, and they would not absorb substances from one another. <b>Abaye said: Granted that</b> cold foods <b>do not require</b> the <b>peeling</b> of the place where they came into contact, as they do not absorb substances from one another. Nevertheless, <b>don’t they require rinsing</b> in water? The Sages therefore decreed against the contact of even cold meat and cheese, lest one come to eat them without rinsing them first.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Two guests may eat</b> together <b>on</b> one <b>table,</b> this one eating meat and that one eating cheese. <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Ami says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the guests <b>do not know each other,</b> as they will not eat of each other’s food. <b>But</b> in a situation where <b>they know each other,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> for them to eat together at the same table.
<b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If <b>two guests roomed in one inn, this one coming from the north and that one coming from the south, this one coming with his piece</b> of meat <b>and that one coming with his cheese, they may eat</b> together <b>on one table, this one</b> eating <b>meat and that one cheese, and they</b> need <b>not be concerned.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And</b> the Sages <b>prohibited</b> this practice <b>only</b> if they both eat <b>from one parcel.</b> The Gemara adds: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is actually referring to a case where they eat from <b>one parcel?</b> This is obviously prohibited. <b>Rather,</b> it prohibits eating even in a manner <b>as though</b> they were eating from <b>one parcel,</b> i.e., when the diners are somewhat acquainted with each other, since neither would mind if the other ate from his food.
§ It was stated above that if two diners are acquainted with each other they may not eat meat and cheese on the same table. <b>Rav Yeimar bar Shelemya said to Abaye:</b> If these diners are <b>two brothers, but they are</b> each <b>particular</b> not to let <b>one another</b> eat of his food, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? May they eat separate dishes of meat and cheese at a single table?
Abaye <b>said to him:</b> Your question evokes that of Baitos ben Zunin. The Sages prohibited the baking of elaborately decorated Syrian cakes for Passover, lest people tarry in their preparation and the cakes become leavened. Baitos wished to prepare the cakes in a way that would not lead to a violation of any prohibition, and yet the Sages prohibited it, because people <b>will say: All the</b> decorated <b>Syrian cakes are forbidden, but the Syrian cakes of Baitos are permitted?</b> Here too, to avoid confusion, we will not allow exceptions to the rule.
Rav Yeimar responded: <b>But according to your reasoning,</b> one may refute <b>that which Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Although the Sages prohibited laundering on the intermediate days of a Festival, <b>one who has only one shirt is permitted to launder it on the intermediate days of a Festival.</b> Here too, one can claim: People <b>will say</b> metaphorically:

Daf 108a

<b>All the Syrian cakes are prohibited, but the Syrian cakes of Baitos are permitted?</b> The Gemara responds: With regard to the case <b>there, Mar, son of Rav Ashi, said: His belt is proof for him,</b> as in those days people commonly had one belt, which was worn over the shirt. If a person had more than one shirt, then whenever he laundered one he would remove the belt and wear it over the second. If one saw a shirt being washed with its belt, he would know that the owner had only one shirt.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a drop of milk that fell on a piece</b> of meat, <b>if</b> the drop <b>contains</b> enough milk <b>to impart flavor to that piece</b> of meat, i.e., the meat is less than sixty times the size of the drop, the meat is <b>forbidden.</b> If <b>one stirred</b> the contents of <b>the pot</b> and the piece was submerged in the gravy before it absorbed the milk, <b>if</b> the drop <b>contains</b> enough milk <b>to impart flavor to</b> the contents of <b>that</b> entire <b>pot,</b> the contents of the entire pot are <b>forbidden.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Abaye said:</b> The principle that <b>the flavor</b> of a forbidden food renders prohibited the substance in which it is absorbed, <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> necessary for there to be <b>actual</b> forbidden substance, applies <b>by Torah law in general,</b> and not just to the prohibition of meat cooked in milk.
<b>As, if it enters your mind</b> that the principle applies to other prohibited foods <b>by rabbinic law,</b> one can claim: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>we do not learn</b> that it applies by Torah law <b>from</b> the analogous case of <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk?</b> It must be <b>because</b> the prohibition of meat cooked in milk <b>is a novelty</b> that is not derived through logical reasoning, as each substance is separately permitted, and they are prohibited only when cooked together. No analogies can be drawn to a novelty. But <b>if</b> the prohibition <b>is a novelty,</b> then <b>even if there is not</b> enough milk to <b>impart flavor,</b> the meat and milk should <b>also</b> be prohibited. Since the measure of the prohibition follows the standard principles of mixtures, the prohibition itself is apparently not a novelty. One may therefore draw an analogy to other mixtures, inferring that this measure applies to them by Torah law as well.
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: This is not a valid proof. The prohibition of meat cooked in milk is in fact a novelty and differs from other prohibited mixtures. Nevertheless, its measure is the imparting of flavor only because the action <b>the Torah prohibited</b> is in <b>the manner of cooking,</b> and cooking involves the imparting of flavor.
§ The mishna teaches that if the piece of meat acquires the flavor of milk, it is forbidden. <b>Rav says: Once</b> the milk <b>imparts flavor to the piece</b> of meat, the <b>piece itself becomes non-kosher</b> meat in its own right. <b>And</b> therefore, if one did not immediately remove the piece from the pot, <b>it renders all the pieces</b> of meat in the pot <b>forbidden,</b> even if they are together more than sixty times the size of that forbidden piece. This is <b>because they are</b> the same <b>type</b> as the forbidden piece, and as a rule, a substance in contact with the same type of substance cannot be nullified.
<b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, said to Ravina: Now</b> consider, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion did <b>Rav say his <i>halakha</i>?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that <b>a type</b> of food mixed with food <b>of</b> its <b>own type is not nullified.</b> If so, <b>shall we say</b> that Rav <b>disagrees with Rava’s</b> interpretation of Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion?
<b>As Rava said: Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> with regard to <b>any</b> tripartite mixture <b>consisting of</b> a forbidden <b>type</b> of food, a permitted food of <b>the same type, and another</b> food <b>item</b> that is permitted, one <b>disregards</b> the permitted food that is its <b>own type as though it were not there, and</b> if the permitted food <b>that is not</b> of <b>its own type is more than</b> the forbidden food, the permitted food <b>nullifies</b> the forbidden food. In the case Rav describes, although the other pieces of meat are of the same type as the piece that has become forbidden, the gravy in the pot is not of the same type, and it should nullify the forbidden piece. Since Rav does not mention this principle, he apparently disagrees with it.
Ravina <b>said to him: If</b> the forbidden substance <b>fell into thin gravy,</b> Rav would concede that the gravy would <b>indeed</b> nullify the piece of meat, since the two substances are of different types. <b>But here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where it fell into thick gravy,</b> which is composed of meat residue. Since the gravy is of the same substance as the meat, the forbidden piece is not nullified.
The Gemara returns to Rav’s statement that the piece of meat upon which the milk fell is considered a non-kosher item in its own right. <b>And what does</b> Rav <b>maintain</b> in this regard? <b>If he maintains</b> that an item <b>that can be wrung</b> to remove the forbidden substance it contains becomes <b>permitted</b> again after wringing, then it follows that only the absorbed substance is truly forbidden. If so, <b>why</b> should this <b>piece</b> of meat itself <b>become non-kosher?</b> Once it has been mixed into the stew, the milk it has absorbed should be evenly distributed throughout the pot and be nullified. <b>Rather,</b> Rav must <b>maintain</b> that even an item <b>that can be wrung</b> to remove the forbidden substance is <b>forbidden.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>As it was stated: Rav and Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that even an item <b>that can be wrung</b> to remove the forbidden substance is <b>forbidden,</b> whereas <b>Shmuel, and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Reish Lakish say:</b> An item <b>that can be wrung</b> to remove the forbidden substance is <b>permitted.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rav</b> really <b>maintain</b> that an item <b>that can be wrung</b> to remove the forbidden substance is <b>forbidden? But wasn’t it stated:</b> If <b>an olive-bulk of meat fell into a pot of milk</b> so large that the meat did not impart flavor to it, <b>Rav says:</b> The <b>meat is forbidden,</b> as it absorbed the taste of the milk, <b>but</b> the <b>milk is permitted,</b> since it did not absorb the taste of the meat. <b>But if it enters your mind</b> that according to Rav an item <b>that can be wrung is forbidden,</b>

Daf 108b

<b>why is</b> the <b>milk permitted?</b> All the milk that the meat absorbed <b>is</b> rendered <b>non-kosher milk</b> in and of itself. When it seeps back out of the meat, it cannot be nullified by the rest of the milk, which is the same substance, as Rav holds in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda that a type of food mixed with food of its own type is not nullified. Therefore, the whole pot of milk should be prohibited.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav actually maintains</b> that an item <b>that can be wrung</b> to remove the forbidden substance is <b>prohibited, and there,</b> the pot of milk mentioned above <b>is different, as the verse states: “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21). The verse teaches that <b>the Torah prohibits</b> only the <b>kid,</b> i.e., the meat, that was cooked in milk, <b>but not</b> the <b>milk</b> that was cooked in meat. The milk is not itself rendered non-kosher.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And does Rav</b> really <b>maintain</b> that <b>the Torah prohibits</b> only the <b>kid but not</b> the <b>milk</b> cooked with it? <b>But isn’t it stated:</b> If <b>half an olive-bulk of meat and half an olive-bulk of milk were cooked together, Rav says:</b> One <b>is flogged for consuming</b> the combined olive-bulk, as he has eaten a whole olive-bulk of forbidden food. <b>But he is not flogged for cooking</b> the two half olive-bulks, as he did not cook items of the minimum size. <b>And if</b> it should <b>enter your mind</b> that Rav holds that <b>the Torah prohibits</b> only the <b>kid but not</b> the <b>milk, why is</b> this individual <b>flogged for consuming</b> only half an olive-bulk of meat? <b>It is</b> only <b>half</b> the prohibited <b>measure.</b>
<b>Rather, Rav actually maintains</b> that <b>milk</b> cooked in meat <b>is also prohibited, and</b> the reason Rav permits the pot of milk mentioned above is that <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the olive-bulk of meat <b>fell into a boiling pot</b> of milk. In such a case the meat <b>absorbs</b> milk, but <b>it does not expel</b> it, and therefore the prohibited milk does not mix with the rest.
The Gemara challenges: <b>Ultimately, when</b> the pot <b>cools</b> from boiling, the meat <b>then expels</b> the prohibited milk. The Gemara answers: It is referring to a case <b>where he first removed</b> the meat before the pot cooled.
The Gemara turns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> mentioned above: If <b>half an olive-bulk of meat and half an olive-bulk of milk were cooked together, Rav says:</b> One <b>is flogged for consuming</b> the mixture, <b>but he is not flogged for cooking it.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, this ruling is problematic. <b>If</b> these two halves of olive-bulks <b>combine</b> to form the requisite measure, then <b>let him be flogged for cooking</b> them <b>as well.</b> And <b>if they do not combine,</b> then <b>let him not be flogged for</b> their <b>consumption either.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> half an olive-bulk of meat and half an olive-bulk of milk <b>do not combine</b> to form the requisite measure, <b>and</b> when Rav says that one is flogged for consuming them, he is referring <b>to</b> a case where they <b>come from a large pot,</b> in which a sizable amount of meat and cheese had been cooked. The mixture is now considered a single prohibited entity, such that half an olive-bulk of the cheese and the meat can combine to constitute the requisite measure to be held liable for consumption.
<b>And Levi</b> disagrees with Rav on this matter, and <b>says:</b> Half an olive-bulk of meat and half an olive-bulk of milk can combine to form the requisite measure, and therefore one <b>is also flogged for cooking</b> the mixture. <b>And so Levi teaches in</b> his collection of <b><i>baraitot</i>: Just as one is flogged for consuming it, so too he is flogged for cooking it. And for what</b> degree of <b>cooking did they say</b> that one is liable to be flogged? It is <b>for</b> a degree of <b>cooking</b> that produces food <b>that others,</b> gentiles, would <b>eat due to its cooking,</b> i.e., cooking that renders it fit for consumption.
§ The Gemara returns to the issue previously discussed: <b>And</b> the case of an item <b>that can be wrung</b> to remove an absorbed prohibited substance <b>is itself</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a drop of milk fell onto a piece</b> of meat, <b>once it imparts flavor to the piece, the piece itself is rendered non-kosher</b> in its own right. <b>And</b> it therefore <b>renders all the</b> other <b>pieces</b> of meat in the pot <b>prohibited,</b> even if they combine to more than sixty times its size; this is <b>because they are</b> of <b>the same type,</b> and a type of food mixed with food of its own type is not nullified. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say</b> that even the original piece of meat is not prohibited <b>unless</b> there is enough milk to <b>impart flavor</b> even <b>to the gravy and to the spices and to the</b> other <b>pieces</b> of meat in the pot, since the milk is assumed to diffuse from the first piece until it is evenly distributed throughout the pot.
With regard to this dispute, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears</b> to be correct in a case <b>where one did not stir</b> the contents of the pot <b>and where he did not cover</b> it, both of which would promote the diffusion of the milk throughout the pot. <b>And the statement of the Rabbis</b> appears to be correct in a case <b>where one stirred</b> the contents of the pot <b>and covered</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the clause: Where <b>one did not stir</b> the pot <b>and did not cover</b> it? <b>If we say</b> that he <b>did not stir</b> the contents of the pot <b>at all and did not cover</b> it <b>at all,</b> in this case the piece of meat onto which the milk fell <b>absorbs</b> the drop of milk but <b>does not expel</b> it. Therefore, even according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda there is no reason to prohibit the other pieces of meat.
<b>And</b> if you say <b>rather</b> that <b>he did not not stir</b> the contents of the pot <b>at the beginning,</b> immediately after the milk fell in, <b>but</b> stirred <b>at the end,</b> afterward, <b>and</b> likewise <b>he did not cover</b> the pot <b>at the beginning but at the end,</b> one must ask: <b>Why</b> are all the pieces in the pot prohibited? The same milk that the piece <b>absorbs</b> it subsequently <b>expels,</b> and once the milk diffuses throughout the pot it should be nullified.
The Gemara responds: Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>maintains</b> that an item <b>that can be wrung</b> remains <b>prohibited.</b> Once the first piece of meat absorbs the milk, it is considered non-kosher in its own right, and even after the milk itself is nullified, the flavor of the forbidden meat renders the rest of the pieces prohibited. The flavor of the meat cannot be nullified by the other meat in the pot, since a substance in contact with the same type of substance is not nullified, according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.

Daf 109a

The Gemara objects: From Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s acceptance of Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion only when one did not stir or cover the pot, one can conclude <b>by inference that Rabbi Yehuda</b> himself <b>maintains</b> that even <b>when one stirred</b> the contents of the pot continuously <b>from beginning to end,</b> i.e., before and after the drop of milk was absorbed, <b>or covered</b> the pot continuously <b>from beginning to end,</b> all the contents of the pot are <b>prohibited.</b> But <b>why</b> should this be so? The first piece of meat <b>did not absorb any</b> more milk than the others. Since the milk definitely diffused evenly through the pot immediately, it should be nullified, assuming that the pot’s contents amount to more than sixty times the milk.
The Gemara responds: <b>Say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda is stringent because one might <b>not</b> have <b>stirred thoroughly, or</b> he might <b>not</b> have <b>covered</b> the pot <b>thoroughly,</b> and therefore initially the milk might have been absorbed only by the first piece, rendering it prohibited. Afterward, when he does stir thoroughly, that piece of meat renders the other pieces prohibited. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does not share this concern.
§ The Gemara returns to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement: <b>The Master said</b> above: <b>And the statement of the Rabbis</b> appears correct in a case <b>where one stirred</b> the pot <b>and covered</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>Stirred, and what</b> is the meaning of the term: <b>Covered? If we say</b> that he <b>stirred at the end,</b> after the first piece absorbed the milk, <b>and did not stir at the beginning,</b> beforehand, <b>and</b> likewise he <b>covered at the end and did not cover at the beginning,</b> one may respond: <b>Didn’t you</b> already <b>say</b> on the previous <i>amud</i> that <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears</b> to be correct <b>in this</b> case? <b>Rather,</b> it must be a case where he <b>stirred</b> continuously <b>from beginning to end or covered</b> the pot continuously <b>from beginning to end.</b>
If so, one can conclude <b>by inference</b> from Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s qualified acceptance of the Rabbis’ opinion <b>that the Rabbis</b> themselves <b>maintain</b> that even when one <b>stirred</b> only <b>at the end and did not stir at the beginning,</b> and similarly if he <b>covered</b> the pot only <b>at the end and did not cover at the beginning,</b> all the contents of the pot are <b>permitted.</b> Even the first piece is permitted, as they hold that the milk it absorbed diffused out of it and throughout the pot.
<b>Evidently,</b> the Rabbis <b>maintain</b> that an item <b>that can be wrung</b> to remove the forbidden substance is <b>permitted.</b> This illustrates that <i>tanna’im</i> dispute this issue, as according to Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, an item that can be wrung to remove the forbidden substance is prohibited.
<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> an item <b>that can be wrung? Perhaps</b> even if an item <b>can be wrung, everyone agrees</b> that it remains <b>prohibited, and here they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type</b> can be nullified. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he said</b> that <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type cannot be nullified. And</b> likewise, <b>the Rabbis</b> conform <b>to their</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as they said</b> that <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type can be nullified.</b> This is why they maintain that all the meat in the pot is permitted.
Ravina responded: <b>What is this</b> reasoning? <b>Granted, if you say that the Rabbis here hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to</b> the issue of <b>a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type, and they disagree with regard to</b> an item <b>that can be wrung, that is</b> why <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears</b> to be correct <b>in this</b> case, when one did not initially stir or cover the pot, <b>and the statement of the Rabbis</b> appears to be correct <b>in that</b> case, when one did initially stir or cover it, since the issue of when one stirred or covered the pot is relevant to the dispute, as explained above.
<b>But if you say: Everyone agrees</b> that an item <b>that can be wrung is prohibited, and here they disagree</b> only <b>with regard to a type</b> of food mixed <b>with</b> food of <b>its</b> own <b>type,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi should not phrase his statement as a qualified acceptance of both opinions, which seems arbitrary. Rather, <b>he should have</b> said <b>this:</b> I accept that a type of food is not nullified by a food of its own type. Therefore, <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears</b> correct where one did not stir initially, as the flavor of the prohibited first piece cannot be nullified; <b>but</b> it <b>does not appear</b> correct where one stirred immediately, since in that case, even the first piece is not prohibited, and I do not share Rabbi Yehuda’s concern that perhaps one did not stir thoroughly. <b>And nothing more</b> need be said.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who wants to eat <b>the udder</b> of a slaughtered animal <b>tears it and removes its milk,</b> and only then is it permitted to cook it. If <b>he did not tear</b> the udder before cooking it, <b>he does not violate</b> the prohibition against cooking and eating meat and milk and does not receive lashes <b>for it,</b> as the halakhic status of the milk in the udder is not that of milk. One who wants to eat <b>the heart</b> of a slaughtered animal <b>tears it and removes its blood,</b> and only then may he cook and eat it. If <b>he did not tear</b> the heart before cooking and eating it, <b>he does not violate</b> the prohibition against consuming blood and is not liable to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for it.</b>

Daf 109b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one did not tear the udder of a slaughtered animal before cooking it he does not violate the biblical prohibition against eating meat and milk. <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav says: He does not violate</b> the prohibition, <b>and</b> it is altogether <b>permitted</b> to eat the cooked product <i>ab initio</i>. The Gemara objects: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>He does not violate</b> the prohibition, i.e., he is not held liable after the fact. One can infer from here as follows: <b>He does not violate</b> a prohibition by Torah law, <b>but there is</b> nevertheless <b>a prohibition</b> <i>ab initio</i> by rabbinic law.
The Gemara explains: <b>By right</b> the mishna <b>should have</b> taught <b>that there is no prohibition</b> here by rabbinic law <b>either. But</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna uses this language <b>since he wants to teach</b> in <b>the latter clause:</b> One who wants to eat <b>the heart</b> of a slaughtered animal <b>tears it and removes its blood,</b> but if <b>he did not tear</b> the heart before cooking and eating it, <b>he does not violate</b> the prohibition. <b>There</b> it is true that although <b>he does not violate</b> a prohibition by Torah law <b>there is a prohibition</b> by rabbinic law. To preserve linguistic symmetry, <b>he teaches the first clause</b> in this manner <b>as well,</b> stating: <b>He does not violate</b> the prohibition.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> this opinion: One who wants to eat <b>the udder</b> of a slaughtered animal <b>tears it and removes its milk.</b> If <b>he did not tear</b> the udder before cooking it, <b>he does not violate</b> the prohibition against cooking and eating meat and milk and does not receive lashes <b>for it.</b> One who wants to eat <b>the heart</b> of a slaughtered animal <b>tears it and removes its blood.</b> If <b>he did not tear</b> the heart before cooking and eating it, <b>he tears it after its cooking, and it is permitted.</b> One can infer from the <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is</b> only the <b>heart that requires tearing</b> after cooking if it was not torn beforehand. <b>But</b> the <b>udder does not require tearing</b> after being cooked unlawfully. Evidently, it is permitted as is.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps</b> one should infer the opposite, that <b>tearing</b> after cooking <b>is sufficient</b> only <b>to</b> render the <b>heart</b> permitted, as the heart does not absorb blood through cooking. <b>But tearing</b> after cooking <b>is not sufficient to</b> render the <b>udder</b> permitted, as the meat of the udder absorbs the milk through cooking, and tearing will not remove the absorbed milk.
<b>And some say</b> a different version of the above exchange, based on a different version of Rav’s statement: <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If one does not tear the udder of a slaughtered animal before cooking it, <b>he does not violate</b> the Torah prohibition, <b>but</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to eat the cooked product by rabbinic law. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the mishna <b>supports</b> this opinion, as it states: <b>He does not violate</b> the prohibition, indicating that although <b>he does not violate</b> a Torah prohibition and is not flogged, <b>there is</b> nevertheless <b>a prohibition</b> by rabbinic law.
The Gemara responds: <b>By right</b> the mishna <b>should have</b> taught <b>that there is not even a prohibition</b> by rabbinic law. <b>But</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna uses this language <b>since he wants to teach the latter clause:</b> One who wants to eat <b>the heart</b> of a slaughtered animal <b>tears it and removes its blood,</b> but if <b>he did not tear</b> the heart before cooking and eating it, <b>he does not violate</b> the prohibition <b>for it. There,</b> it is true that although <b>he does not violate</b> a Torah prohibition <b>there is a prohibition</b> by rabbinic law. <b>He</b> therefore <b>teaches</b> in <b>the first clause</b> in this manner <b>as well,</b> stating: <b>He does not violate</b> the prohibition <b>for it.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: One who wants to eat <b>the udder</b> of a slaughtered animal <b>tears it and removes its milk.</b> If <b>he did not tear</b> the udder before cooking it, <b>he does not violate</b> the prohibition <b>for it.</b> One who wants to eat <b>the heart</b> of a slaughtered animal <b>tears it and removes its blood.</b> If <b>he did not tear</b> the heart before cooking and eating it, <b>he tears it after its cooking, and it is permitted.</b> One can infer from the <i>baraita</i> that <b>it is</b> only the <b>heart that requires tearing</b> after cooking if it was not torn beforehand, <b>but</b> the <b>udder does not require tearing</b> after being cooked unlawfully. Evidently, it is permitted as is.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps</b> one should infer the opposite, that <b>tearing</b> after cooking <b>is sufficient</b> only <b>to</b> render the <b>heart</b> permitted, as the heart does not absorb blood through cooking. <b>But tearing</b> it after cooking <b>is not sufficient to</b> render the <b>udder</b> permitted, as the meat of the udder absorbs the milk through cooking, and tearing will not remove the absorbed milk. This concludes the second version of the Gemara’s discussion.
The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with the first version of Rav’s</b> statement: <b>An udder that one cooked,</b> i.e., roasted, <b>in its milk is permitted.</b> By contrast, the <b>stomach</b> of a suckling lamb or calf <b>that one cooked,</b> i.e., roasted, together <b>with</b> the <b>milk</b> it contains is <b>prohibited</b> for consumption.
The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>And what</b> is the <b>distinction between this</b> stomach <b>and that</b> udder? The milk <b>this</b> calf suckled was considered milk the moment it left the mother’s teat, and it was merely <b>collected in</b> the calf’s <b>innards. But that</b> milk in the udder is not defined as milk, since it was <b>never collected in</b> the animal’s <b>innards</b> from outside but is found in the flesh. Consequently, this meat of the udder is not prohibited if it is roasted with the milk it contains, although one should still tear it by rabbinic law <i>ab initio</i>.
§ The Gemara inquires: <b>How must one tear</b> an udder before cooking it? <b>Rav Yehuda says: One tears it lengthwise and widthwise [<i>sheti va’erev</i>] and smears it against a wall</b> to remove all the milk. The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Elazar said to his attendant: Tear</b> an udder <b>for me</b> before you roast it, <b>and I will eat</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this episode <b>teaching us? It is</b> explicitly stated in <b>the mishna</b> that one must do this. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> story <b>teaches us that</b> according to Rabbi Elazar <b>we do not require</b> one to tear it <b>lengthwise and widthwise and smear it against a wall.</b> Rather, it is enough simply to tear it once, either lengthwise or widthwise.
§ <b>Yalta said to</b> her husband <b>Rav Naḥman: Now</b> as a rule, for <b>any</b> item <b>that the Merciful One prohibited to us, He permitted to us a similar</b> item. He <b>prohibited to us</b> the consumption of <b>blood,</b> yet <b>He permitted to us</b> the consumption of <b>liver,</b> which is filled with blood and retains the taste of blood. Likewise, God prohibited sexual intercourse with <b>a menstruating woman,</b> but permitted sexual intercourse with one’s wife while she discharges <b>the blood of purity.</b> During a particular period after giving birth, even if she experiences a flow of blood she is not rendered ritually impure and remains permitted to her husband by Torah law.
Furthermore, the Torah prohibits the consumption of the forbidden <b>fat of a domesticated animal,</b> but permitted the <b>fat of an undomesticated animal,</b> which has the same flavor. It is prohibited to eat <b>pork,</b> but one may eat <b>the brain of a <i>shibuta</i></b> fish, which has a similar taste. One may not eat <b><i>giruta</i>,</b> a non-kosher fish, but one may eat the <b>tongue of a fish,</b> which tastes similar.
Likewise, the Torah prohibits sexual intercourse with <b>the wife of</b> another <b>man</b> but permitted one to marry <b>a divorced woman in her</b> previous <b>husband’s lifetime.</b> The Torah prohibits sexual intercourse with one’s <b>brother’s wife,</b> and yet it permits one to marry his <b><i>yevama</i>,</b> i.e., his brother’s widow when the brother dies childless. Finally, the Torah prohibits sexual intercourse with <b>a gentile woman</b> but permitted one to marry <b>a beautiful woman</b> who is a prisoner of war (see Deuteronomy 21:10–14). Yalta concluded: The Torah prohibits the consumption of meat cooked in milk; <b>I wish to eat</b> a dish that tastes like <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk.</b>
Upon hearing this, <b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> his <b>cooks: Roast udders on a spit for her.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that one must <b>tear</b> the udder first? Rav Naḥman did not tell his cooks to tear the udders. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> requirement was stated only <b>with regard to</b> cooking in <b>a pot,</b> not roasting.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> cited above: An udder <b>that one cooked</b> in its milk is permitted? This indicates that <b>after the fact, yes,</b> it is permitted, but one may <b>not</b> roast it <b><i>ab initio</i></b> without tearing it. The Gemara answers: <b>The same is true even</b> of roasting <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> i.e., it is permitted, <b>and</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> uses this language <b>since he wants to teach</b> in <b>the latter clause: A stomach</b>

Daf 110a

of a suckling lamb or calf <b>that one cooked</b> together <b>with</b> the <b>milk</b> it contains <b>is prohibited.</b> There, <b>even</b> if one roasted it he may <b>not</b> eat it <b>after the fact.</b> To preserve symmetry, the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> in <b>the first clause</b> in this manner <b>as well,</b> stating: An udder <b>that one cooked</b> in its milk is permitted.
§ The Gemara above cited a second version of Rav’s opinion, according to which an udder that was roasted without being torn is prohibited for consumption. The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Elazar ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael <b>he found Ze’eiri</b> and <b>said to him: Is there a <i>tanna</i> who taught Rav</b> that <b>an udder</b> roasted without first being torn is prohibited? Ze’eiri <b>showed him Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi.</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>I did not teach</b> Rav that <b>an udder</b> is prohibited <b>at all;</b> rather, <b>Rav found</b> an unguarded <b>valley and fenced it in.</b> Rav taught this stringent ruling as an additional safeguard in Babylonia, where Jews were not careful about the prohibition of meat cooked in milk.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>As</b> when <b>Rav arrived in Tatlefush, he heard a certain woman saying to another: How much milk does it require to cook a quarter</b> weight <b>of meat?</b> Rav <b>said:</b> Evidently, these people <b>are not learned</b> enough in <i>halakha</i> to know <b>that meat</b> cooked <b>in milk is prohibited.</b> Rav <b>tarried</b> in that place, <b>and prohibited</b> even <b>udders to them,</b> so that they would not come to violate the prohibition of meat cooked in milk.
<b>Rav Kahana teaches</b> that Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi replied to Rabbi Elazar in <b>that</b> manner described above. By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Abba teaches</b> that Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi said: <b>I taught</b> Rav only that <b>the udder of</b> an animal <b>nursing</b> offspring is prohibited, as its udder contains much milk. <b>And due to the sharp</b> mind <b>of Rav Ḥiyya,</b> Rav’s teacher, he assumed that Rav too would understand this without his saying so explicitly. Therefore, he <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> to Rav with regard to <b>an unspecified udder.</b> Rav mistakenly thought that the ruling applies to all animals.
The Gemara relates that <b>Ravin and Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef arrived at the house of Rav Pappi.</b> The servants <b>brought before them a dish</b> made <b>of udder. Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef ate</b> of it, but <b>Ravin did not eat. Abaye said: Bereaved Ravin, why do you not eat? After all, Rav Pappi’s wife is the daughter of Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa, and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa was a master of</b> good <b>deeds,</b> who was meticulous in his performance of mitzvot. <b>Had</b> Rav Pappi’s wife <b>not heard in her father’s house</b> that such a dish is permitted, <b>she would not have made</b> it.
The Gemara relates: <b>In Sura they would not eat udders</b> at all, even torn and roasted. But <b>in Pumbedita they would eat udders. Rami bar Tamrei, who is</b> also called <b>Rami bar Dikulei, from Pumbedita, arrived in Sura on the eve of Yom Kippur.</b> Since it is a mitzva to eat and drink then, large quantities of meat were cooked, and <b>everyone brought out their udders</b> from the animals they had slaughtered and <b>threw them</b> away. Rami bar Tamrei <b>went</b> and <b>gathered</b> the udders, roasted them, and <b>ate them,</b> in accordance with his custom.
The residents of Sura <b>brought</b> Rami bar Tamrei <b>before Rav Ḥisda,</b> who <b>said to him: Why did you do this?</b> Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>I am from the place of Rav Yehuda, who eats</b> udders, and this is the accepted custom in Pumbedita. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: And do you not hold</b> by the principle that the Sages <b>impose upon</b> a traveler <b>the stringencies of the place that he left and</b> also <b>the stringencies of the place to which he went?</b> You should have accepted the stringency of Sura and not eaten the udders. Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: That principle applies only to one who remains in the place he is visiting, but <b>I ate</b> the udders <b>outside the boundaries</b> of Sura.
Rav Ḥisda further asked Rami bar Tamrei: <b>And with what did you roast</b> the udders? Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to him:</b> I roasted them <b>with grape seeds</b> [<b><i>purtzenei</i></b>] I found in the vines there. Rav Ḥisda objected: <b>But</b> how could you roast the udders with grape seeds, as <b>perhaps they were from wine</b> used for <b>a libation</b> to idolatry, from which it is prohibited to derive benefit. Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to him:</b> These <b>were</b> old seeds that still lay there <b>after twelve months</b> had passed since the grapes were used, and any prohibition had expired, as by that point they are assumed to have lost any prohibited liquid that previously remained inside (see <i>Avoda Zara</i> 34a).
Rav Ḥisda further objected: <b>But perhaps</b> these seeds <b>were from stolen</b> property, i.e., they belonged to someone and it was prohibited for you to take them. Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to him:</b> Even so, in this case <b>there was</b> certainly <b>despair of the owners</b> of recovering them, <b>as grass was growing among them.</b> Since the owners had allowed them to lie there for so long, they had clearly given up all hope of retrieving them.
Rav Ḥisda <b>saw that</b> Rami bar Tamrei <b>had not donned phylacteries,</b> and <b>said to him: What is the reason that you have not donned phylacteries?</b> Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to him: He,</b> i.e., I, am suffering from <b>intestinal illness, and Rav Yehuda said</b> that one who has <b>intestinal illness is exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>phylacteries,</b> which require a clean body, because he would have to remove them constantly to defecate.
Rav Ḥisda further <b>saw that</b> Rami bar Tamrei <b>had not placed</b> the <b>threads</b> of ritual fringes on his garment and <b>said to him: What is the reason that you do not have</b> the <b>threads</b> of ritual fringes? Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to him: It is a borrowed robe, and Rav Yehuda said:</b>

Daf 110b

With regard to <b>a borrowed robe,</b> during <b>all</b> of the first <b>thirty days</b> that one borrows it, one is <b>exempt from</b> performing the mitzva of <b>ritual fringes</b> with it.
<b>Meanwhile,</b> as Rav Ḥisda and Rami bar Tamrei were talking, the attendants <b>brought</b> in <b>a certain man</b> to Rav Ḥisda’s court <b>who would not honor his father and mother,</b> and <b>they tied him</b> to a pillar in order to flog him.
Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to them: Leave him</b> alone, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>any positive mitzva whose reward</b> is stated <b>alongside it</b> in the Torah, <b>the</b> earthly <b>court below is not warned to</b> enforce <b>it</b> through punishments such as flogging. And it is stated after the mitzva of honoring one’s father and mother: “That your days may be long, and that it go well with you” (Deuteronomy 5:16). Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rami bar Tamrei: <b>I see that you are very sharp.</b> Rami bar Tamrei <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>If you were in the place where Rav Yehuda</b> resides, <b>I would</b> be able to <b>show you my sharpness</b> of mind far better than here.
§ Pursuant to the discussion of different local customs, <b>Abaye said to Rav Safra: When you ascend there,</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>ask</b> the Sages there: With regard to <b>liver, how do you</b> treat <b>it? When</b> Rav Safra <b>ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>he found Rav Zerika</b> and asked him this question. Rav Zerika <b>said to him: I cooked</b> liver <b>for Rabbi Ami and he ate</b> it.
<b>When</b> Rav Safra returned to Babylonia and <b>came before</b> Abaye and reported what Rav Zerika had said, Abaye <b>said to him: I do not raise the dilemma</b> as <b>to</b> whether liver <b>renders itself prohibited</b> if cooked alone. It is clear to me that the blood that diffuses out of the liver is not absorbed again while it cooks. <b>When I raise the dilemma,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> whether liver <b>renders prohibited another</b> piece of meat cooked with it. Rav Zerika’s statement therefore has no bearing on my question.
Rav Safra asked Abaye: <b>What is different</b> about the issue of the liver <b>rendering itself prohibited, that you did not raise the dilemma</b> with regard to this case? It is presumably because the answer is obvious to you, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 10:11) that liver <b>is not rendered prohibited</b> by its own cooking. But if so, <b>you should not raise the dilemma with regard to</b> whether it <b>renders the other</b> piece of meat <b>prohibited either, as we learned</b> in that same mishna: <b>Liver renders</b> food cooked with it in the same pot <b>prohibited but is not prohibited</b> itself, <b>because</b> while it does <b>expel</b> blood as it cooks, it <b>does not absorb</b> this blood again, since the blood diffuses only outward. Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Safra: That mishna does not answer my question, as <b>perhaps there</b> it is referring specifically <b>to forbidden liver,</b> e.g., the liver of a non-kosher animal.

Daf 111a

<b>And</b> the other food is not forbidden due to the liver’s blood, <b>but</b> rather <b>due to the fat</b> of the liver it absorbed. But if permitted liver is cooked with another piece of meat, and the concern is only that the meat might be prohibited <b>due to</b> the meat absorbing excess <b>blood</b> from the liver, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Perhaps blood is absorbed less easily than fat.
<b>When</b> Rav Safra <b>again ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Rabbi Zerika</b> once more and asked him about liver cooked with another piece of meat. Rabbi Zerika <b>said to him: You</b> need <b>not ask this</b> question <b>either, as I and Yannai, son of Rabbi Ami, arrived at the house of Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi, and they brought before us the windpipe</b> of an animal <b>with</b> all the parts <b>attached to it,</b> i.e., the lungs, heart, and liver, all of which had been cooked together, <b>and we ate</b> it. This proves that the blood emitted from the liver does not render prohibited other pieces of meat cooked with it.
<b>Rav Ashi, and some say Rabbi Shmuel from Zerokinya, objects to this</b> conclusion: <b>But perhaps</b> in that incident <b>the mouth of the windpipe was</b> positioned <b>outside of the pot,</b> allowing the liver’s excess blood to run out of the pot rather than being absorbed by the other pieces of meat. <b>Alternatively,</b> perhaps they <b>poured boiling liquid on</b> the liver <b>at the outset,</b> before it was cooked with the lung and heart, <b>like that</b> custom <b>of Rav Huna,</b> for whom <b>they would pour boiling vinegar on</b> liver, <b>and</b> that of <b>Rav Naḥman,</b> for whom <b>they would pour boiling water on</b> liver. This would cook the excess blood into the liver and prevent it from diffusing into the other pieces. Abaye’s question remains unresolved.
<b>And</b> with regard to the pouring of boiling vinegar on the liver, <b>Rav Pappa,</b> when he was a student <b>before Rava, thought to say</b> that the <b>vinegar</b> becomes <b>prohibited</b> for consumption in the process, since it absorbs blood from the liver. Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: <b>If</b> you claim that the <b>vinegar is prohibited,</b> then the liver <b>itself</b> should <b>also</b> be <b>prohibited,</b> since <b>just as</b> the liver <b>expels</b> blood and prohibits the vinegar, so too <b>it then absorbs</b> the blood back from the forbidden vinegar. Rather, one must say that no blood is expelled from the liver during this process at all, which is why the liver is permitted afterward.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav bar Shabba visited the house of Rav Naḥman. They brought him cooked liver, but</b> Rava bar Shabba <b>did not partake</b> of it. The members of the household <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: There is <b>a student</b> of Torah <b>inside</b> who <b>is not eating. And who is he? Rav bar Shabba. Rav Naḥman said to them: Feed Shabba</b> against his will.
The Gemara notes: Abaye’s question above with regard to liver cooked with other meat is <b>subject to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: The liver</b> that was cooked with other pieces of meat <b>prohibits</b> them, <b>but</b> it itself <b>is not prohibited, because it expels</b> blood as it cooks <b>but does not absorb</b> it again. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> If the liver was <b>spiced</b> when cooking, it <b>prohibits</b> the other meat <b>and</b> it becomes <b>prohibited</b> as well, as the spices cause the liver to reabsorb the blood that was expelled. Likewise, if the liver was <b>stewed,</b> i.e., heavily cooked, it <b>renders</b> the other pieces <b>prohibited and</b> is itself <b>prohibited.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna visited the house of Rabba bar Rav Naḥman</b> and dined with him on Shabbat. <b>They brought before him three <i>se’a</i></b> of fine bread that had been <b>kneaded</b> in oil and honey. Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>said to</b> the members of Rabba bar Rav Naḥman’s household: <b>Did you know that I was coming,</b> that you prepared such superior food? <b>They said to him: Are you more distinguished than</b> Shabbat, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to Shabbat: <b>“If you proclaim Shabbat a delight,</b> the sacred day of God honored” (Isaiah 58:13).
<b>Meanwhile,</b> Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>found</b> among the dishes before him <b>a certain liver that contained an artery suffused with blood. He said to</b> the members of the household: <b>Why do you do this?</b> Although the blood absorbed in the liver is permitted, that which is collected in the blood vessels is prohibited. The members of the household <b>said to him: Rather, what should we do</b> in order to prepare the liver? Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>said to them:</b> First <b>tear</b> the liver <b>lengthwise and widthwise, and</b> position the side with <b>the tear downward,</b> so that the blood will flow out when you place it on the fire.
The Gemara comments: <b>And this statement</b> applies only to <b>liver,</b> due to the blood that collects in its blood vessels; <b>but</b> there is no need to tear the <b>spleen</b> in this manner, as it <b>merely</b> contains <b>fat.</b> And this ruling <b>accords with that</b> which is reported <b>about Shmuel,</b> that his attendants <b>would prepare a dish of spleens for him on the day that he performed the practice</b> of bloodletting.
§ <b>It was stated:</b> If liver and other meat are roasted on spits in an oven such that <b>the liver</b> is positioned <b>on top of the meat,</b> the meat is <b>permitted</b> even though blood from the liver flows onto it. This is because <b>the blood</b> that flows from an item roasting in the oven <b>slides</b> over meat located underneath it and is not absorbed. But if <b>an udder</b> is positioned <b>on top of the meat</b> when roasted in the oven, the meat is <b>prohibited. What is the reason?</b> It is that the <b>milk</b> expelled by the roasting udder <b>adheres to</b> and is absorbed by the meat.
<b>Rav Dimi from Neharde’a</b> would <b>teach the opposite:</b> Whenever <b>an udder</b> is positioned <b>on top of the meat,</b> the meat is <b>permitted. What is the reason?</b> The prohibition of meat cooked in <b>milk of a slaughtered</b> animal applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and is treated less stringently. But if <b>liver</b> is positioned <b>on top of the meat,</b> the meat is <b>prohibited,</b> as the prohibition of <b>blood</b> applies <b>by Torah law,</b> and one must be concerned that perhaps the meat will absorb blood from the liver.
<b>Mareimar taught</b> in public: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is: <b>Whether</b> in the case of <b>liver or</b> in the case of <b>an udder,</b> if it is <b>underneath the meat,</b> the meat is <b>permitted,</b> but if it is <b>on top of the meat,</b> then <b>after the fact, yes,</b> the meat is permitted, but <b><i>ab initio</i>, no,</b> one may not situate them in this manner.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ashi arrived at the house of his father-in-law Rami bar Abba,</b> and <b>he saw that the son of Rami bar Abba was</b>

Daf 111b

<b>skewering liver on top of meat</b> for roasting. Rav Ashi <b>said: How haughty is this Sage!</b> Even if you <b>say that the Sages stated</b> that one may eat meat roasted under liver <b>after the fact, did they say</b> that one may roast them in this manner <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>And if there is a receptacle</b> under the spit <b>for the drippings</b> of fat, then even if the <b>meat</b> is <b>on top of</b> the <b>liver</b> it is <b>also prohibited</b> to roast the meat, as the blood from the liver will fall into the fat in the vessel, and one might come to eat the mixture.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> roasting a piece of meat by itself over such a vessel, which is permitted? Here too the <b>blood of the meat</b> drips into the fat in the vessel. The Gemara answers: <b>Blood of</b> most <b>meat sinks</b> to the bottom of the vessel, while the fat floats on top. Since the fat can be separated from the blood, it is permitted. By contrast, the <b>blood of the liver floats</b> above the fat and cannot be removed from it, and therefore the entire mixture is prohibited.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b>knife with which one slaughtered</b> an animal absorbs blood due to its heat, and it is therefore <b>prohibited to cut</b> any <b>boiling</b> food <b>with it,</b> since that food will in turn absorb the blood from the knife. If one cut <b>cold</b> food with this knife, <b>some say</b> that the piece he cut <b>requires rinsing</b> before one may eat it, <b>and some say</b> that it <b>does not require rinsing.</b>
§ The Gemara cites other statements of Shmuel. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a bowl in which meat was salted</b> to remove its blood before cooking, it is <b>prohibited to eat</b> any <b>boiling</b> food placed <b>in it,</b> as that food absorbs blood of the meat from the bowl. <b>And</b> in this <b>Shmuel</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Shmuel said: A salted</b> food imparts its flavor <b>like a boiling</b> food, <b>and</b> a food item <b>marinated</b> in vinegar, brine, or the like absorbs flavor from the liquid or vessel <b>as</b> would <b>a cooked</b> food.
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A salted</b> food <b>is not</b> considered <b>like a boiling</b> food, <b>and a marinated</b> food <b>is not</b> considered <b>like a cooked</b> food. <b>Abaye said:</b> I can prove that <b>this</b> ruling <b>that Ravin</b> cited <b>is not</b> correct, <b>as there was a certain bowl</b> [<b><i>pinka</i></b>] <b>in Rabbi Ami’s house in which meat was salted, and</b> Rabbi Ami <b>broke it</b> so that it would no longer be used. <b>Now Rabbi Ami was a student of Rabbi Yoḥanan. What is the reason he broke</b> that bowl? Is it <b>not because he heard that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A salted</b> food <b>is</b> considered <b>like a boiling</b> food? Ravin’s citation was evidently in error.
<b>Rav Kahana, the brother of Rav Yehuda, sat before Rav Huna, and he sat and said:</b> With regard to <b>a bowl in which meat was salted, it is prohibited to eat</b> any <b>boiling</b> food placed <b>in it. And</b> he added: With regard to <b>a radish that one cut with a knife</b> used for cutting meat, it is <b>permitted to eat it with <i>kutaḥ</i>,</b> a food that contains milk, even though the sharpness of the radish causes it to absorb the fat of the meat from the knife.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> to distinguish between blood absorbed in a bowl and fat absorbed by the radish? <b>Abaye said: This</b> radish <b>absorbed a permitted</b> substance, as the fat on the knife is permitted for consumption by itself, <b>but that</b> bowl in which meat was salted <b>absorbed a prohibited</b> substance, i.e., blood.
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: And <b>if</b> the radish <b>absorbed a permitted</b> substance, <b>what of it? Ultimately,</b> if one desires to eat the radish with <i>kutaḥ</i>, <b>it is a permitted</b> substance <b>that leads to a prohibition, as he</b> will <b>eat a prohibited</b> substance. <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The distinction is that with regard to <b>this</b> radish, it is <b>possible</b> for a Jew <b>to taste it</b> before eating it with milk to see if it has acquired the flavor of meat. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that</b> bowl, it is <b>not possible</b> for a Jew <b>to taste its</b> contents to see whether they have absorbed blood.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: But let a gentile cook taste</b> the contents of the bowl to see whether they have the taste of blood. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Terumot</i> 8:12): With regard to <b>a pot in which one cooked meat, one may not cook milk in it, and if he cooked</b> milk in it, the meat absorbed in the pot renders the milk forbidden if it <b>imparts flavor</b> to the milk. Likewise, if one <b>cooked <i>teruma</i> in</b> the pot, <b>he may not cook non-sacred</b> food <b>in it, and if he cooked</b> non-sacred food in it, the non-sacred food is prohibited if there is sufficient <i>teruma</i> absorbed in the pot <b>to impart flavor</b> to the non-sacred food.
<b>And we said</b> with regard to this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted,</b> one can know whether the non-sacred food has acquired the flavor of <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> as <b>a priest can taste it. But</b> with regard to the prohibition of <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, who can taste it? And</b> you, Rava, <b>said to us: Let</b> a gentile <b>cook taste it. So too</b> here, with regard to the food in the bowl, <b>let</b> a gentile <b>cook taste it.</b> Rava responded: <b>Indeed,</b> a gentile cook can discover whether the food in the bowl has absorbed the taste of blood. <b>When I said</b> my statement I was referring to a case <b>where there is no</b> gentile <b>cook</b> available.
§ <b>It was stated:</b> If <b>a fish was removed</b> from the fire and placed, still hot, <b>in a bowl</b> in which meat had been eaten, <b>Rav says: It is prohibited to eat</b> the fish <b>with</b> the milk dish <b><i>kutaḥ</i>,</b> since the fish has absorbed meat from the bowl. <b>And Shmuel says: It is permitted to eat</b> the fish <b>with <i>kutaḥ</i>.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav says</b> that it is <b>prohibited</b> to eat the fish with <i>kutaḥ</i> because this <b>is</b> a case of <b>imparted flavor,</b> i.e., from the meat to the fish. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that it is <b>permitted</b> because the flavor is first imparted to the bowl, and only then from the bowl to the fish. This <b>is</b> therefore a case of <b>imparted flavor derived from imparted flavor.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And this</b> opinion <b>of Rav was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference. As Rav arrived at the house of Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya, the son of his son. He felt</b> pain <b>in his eyes, and they prepared for him an ointment in an earthenware bowl</b> as a remedy. <b>Later they placed a dish for him in</b> that same bowl. Rav <b>tasted</b> in that dish <b>the flavor of the ointment</b> and <b>said: It imparts so much flavor!</b> Those present inferred that according to Rav, imparted flavor derived from imparted flavor is strong enough itself to impart flavor. The Gemara rejects this: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so,</b> and one cannot reach any general conclusions from this story. <b>It is different there, as</b> the ointment was <b>very bitter.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Elazar was standing before Mar Shmuel,</b> and <b>they brought before</b> Shmuel <b>a fish that had been removed</b> directly from the fire and placed <b>into a bowl</b> used previously for meat, <b>and he ate</b> it together <b>with <i>kutaḥ</i>.</b> Shmuel <b>gave</b> Rabbi Elazar some of this dish, <b>but</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>did not eat</b> it, as he was a student of Rav, who prohibited such mixtures. Shmuel <b>said to him: To your teacher,</b> Rav, <b>I gave</b> this dish <b>and he ate</b> from it, <b>yet you</b> will <b>not eat?</b> Later Rabbi Elazar <b>came before Rav,</b> and <b>said to him: Did</b> the <b>Master retract this <i>halakha</i>?</b> Do you permit this? Rav <b>said to him: God forbid that the progeny of Abba bar Abba,</b> i.e., Shmuel, <b>would feed me something that I do not hold</b> to be permitted. Shmuel never fed me such a dish.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi were sitting</b> down to eat. <b>One</b> of them was sitting <b>on this side of the ford of</b> the <b>Sura</b> River, <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> was sitting <b>on that side of the ford. They brought</b> one <b>Sage a fish that had been removed</b> from the fire and placed <b>into a bowl</b> previously used for meat, <b>and he ate</b> it together <b>with <i>kutaḥ</i>. They</b> also <b>brought</b> the other <b>Sage figs and grapes during the meal, and he ate</b> them <b>but did not recite</b> a separate <b>blessing</b> over them, even though these foods were usually consumed following the main portion of the meal before reciting Grace after Meals, and a separate blessing was made on them.
One <b>Sage said to his colleague: Orphan!</b> Student without a teacher! <b>Would your teacher do this,</b> i.e., eat such fish with <i>kutaḥ</i>? <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage said to his colleague: Orphan! Would your teacher do this,</b> i.e., eat these fruits during a meal without reciting a blessing over them? One <b>Sage said to his colleague: I hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> who permits eating such fish with <i>kutaḥ</i>. <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage said to his colleague: I hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya, as Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches:</b> The blessing over the <b>bread exempts all</b> the other <b>types of food</b> eaten during a meal, including those usually eaten separately following bread, <b>and</b> likewise the blessing over <b>wine exempts all types of drinks.</b>
<b>Ḥizkiyya says in the name of Abaye:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is: If <b>a fish was removed</b> from the fire and placed <b>into a bowl</b> used for meat, <b>it is permitted to eat</b> it together <b>with <i>kutaḥ</i>.</b> But with regard to <b>a radish that one cut with a knife with which he had cut meat, it is prohibited to eat</b> that radish <b>with <i>kutaḥ</i>,</b> contrary to Rav Kahana’s statement above.
The Gemara notes: <b>And this statement</b> applies only to <b>a radish,</b>

Daf 112a

<b>as due to its sharpness it absorbs</b> the fat on the knife. <b>But</b> if one cut <b>a cucumber</b> with the same knife, it does not absorb the fat to the same extent. One may therefore simply <b>scrape the place of the cut</b> to remove any fat residue, <b>and</b> then one may <b>eat</b> the cucumber with <i>kutaḥ</i>.
Likewise, <b>turnip stalks</b> cut with such a knife are <b>permitted</b> for consumption with <i>kutaḥ</i>. But <b>chard</b> cut with such a knife is <b>prohibited</b> for consumption with <i>kutaḥ</i>, as it absorbs flavor from the knife. <b>And if one alternated between</b> cutting chard <b>and turnip</b> stalks it is <b>permitted,</b> as the turnip stalks nullify the taste of the meat in the knife.
§ <b>Rav Dimi inquired of Rav Naḥman: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard <b>to placing a jug of salt,</b> used to salt meat, <b>alongside a jug of <i>kamka</i>,</b> i.e., <i>kutaḥ</i>, a milk dish? Need one be concerned lest some of the <i>kutaḥ</i> fall on the salt without his knowledge and ultimately contaminate his meat? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: It is prohibited</b> to place the two jugs next to each other. Rav Dimi further inquired: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a similar case involving a jug <b>of vinegar</b> used to season meat? Need one be concerned lest the <i>kutaḥ</i> fall into the vinegar? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: It is permitted</b> to place these two jugs next to each other.
Rav Dimi asked: <b>And what is different</b> about the vinegar? Rav Naḥman responded: <b>When you</b> have thought <b>about it</b> long enough to <b>eat a <i>kor</i> of salt,</b> you will know the reason. The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the reason</b> then? In <b>this</b> case of the salt, <b>the prohibited</b> substance <b>is substantive,</b> as the traces of <i>kutaḥ</i> are discernible and not nullified by the salt. <b>But</b> in <b>that</b> case of the vinegar, <b>the prohibited</b> substance <b>is not substantive,</b> since the <i>kutaḥ</i> melts away in the vinegar and will no longer impart flavor.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain young bird that fell into a jug of <i>kamka</i>,</b> i.e., <i>kutaḥ</i>. <b>Rav Ḥinnana, son of Rava of</b> the city of <b>Pashronya, permitted</b> the bird. <b>Rava said</b> about this: <b>Who is wise</b> enough <b>to</b> discern reasons to <b>permit</b> the food in difficult <b>cases like this, if not Rav Ḥinnana, son of Rava of Pashronya? He maintains</b> that <b>when Shmuel said</b> that <b>a salted</b> food imparts flavor <b>like a boiling</b> food, <b>that statement</b> applies only to a food so salty <b>that it is not eaten due to its salt, but this <i>kutaḥ</i></b> can still be <b>eaten due to,</b> i.e., despite, <b>its salt.</b> Therefore, it is as if both foods are cold and unsalted, and they do not impart flavor to one another, provided one rinses the area of contact.
The Gemara adds: <b>And this statement</b> applies only if the bird is <b>raw, but</b> if it is <b>roasted, it requires peeling</b> to remove the outer layer, since roasting softens the meat and causes it to absorb more flavor. <b>And if it has cracks [<i>pilei</i>], it is entirely forbidden,</b> because the milk is absorbed into the cracks. <b>And if it has been flavored with spices it is</b> likewise <b>entirely forbidden,</b> because the spices soften the meat and render it absorbent.
<b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Shmuel says: It is prohibited to eat a loaf</b> of bread <b>upon which one cut</b> unsalted roasted <b>meat,</b> since the blood expelled from the roasted meat is absorbed in the loaf. The Gemara adds: <b>And this statement</b> applies only <b>if</b> the meat <b>is ruddy</b> from the blood it contains. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>if</b> so much blood was absorbed in the loaf that <b>it passed through</b> from one side of the loaf to the other and was visible from both sides. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>if</b> the liquid emitted by the roasted meat <b>is viscous. But</b> if it is <b>runny, we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> i.e., the loaf is permitted.
The Gemara relates: <b>Shmuel would throw to his dog</b> such a loaf of bread that he held was prohibited. <b>Rav Huna</b> would not eat the loaf himself but <b>would</b> rather <b>give it to his attendant.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, Rav Huna’s behavior is problematic: <b>If</b> the loaf <b>is permitted, it is permitted for everyone,</b> including Rav Huna himself. And <b>if it is prohibited, then it is prohibited for everyone,</b> and he should not give it to his attendant. The Gemara explains: In fact, the loaf is permitted for consumption, and <b>Rav Huna is different, as he is of delicate constitution</b> and did not want to eat the loaf himself. The Gemara further relates: <b>Rava would eat</b> a loaf of this type, <b>and he would call</b> the red liquid <b>meat wine.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: One may not place a vessel under</b> roasting <b>meat</b> to catch the drippings of fat <b>until all the ruddiness of</b> the meat’s <b>appearance has dissipated.</b> Beforehand, though, one must be concerned that blood will fall with the drippings into the vessel, rendering the mixture and the vessel prohibited. The Gemara asks: <b>How do we know</b> when all the meat’s redness has disappeared? <b>Mar Zutra said in the name of Rav Pappa: As soon as its smoke rises,</b> one can be sure that all the blood has been expelled from the meat.
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this: But perhaps the underside</b> of the meat, which is closest to the coals, has been fully <b>roasted,</b> but its <b>upper</b> part is still <b>not roasted</b> and still expels blood at this stage. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said:</b> One who wishes to collect the drippings <b>has no remedy except</b> to <b>place two lumps of salt in it,</b> i.e., one in the receptacle under the meat and one on top, in the meat itself.

Daf 112b

Doing this will allow the blood dripping from the meat to stick to the salt on the sides of the vessel, while the fat will float to the top. <b>And</b> when emptying the receptacle, he should <b>tilt it</b> gently to pour the fat into another vessel without it mixing with the blood.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said to Rav Ashi: And did Shmuel</b> really <b>say this,</b> that once the meat’s ruddiness has dissipated it is permitted to place a receptacle underneath it? <b>But didn’t Shmuel say: It is prohibited to eat a loaf</b> of bread <b>upon which one cut</b> roasted <b>meat?</b> Apparently he holds that meat contains blood even after it has finished roasting. Rav Ashi replied: Shmuel holds that the meat no longer emits blood after its ruddiness has dissipated. And as for his ruling with regard to a loaf of bread, it <b>is different there, as due to the pressure of the knife</b> the meat <b>expels</b> more blood.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If <b>one salted fish and birds together,</b> the fish <b>are prohibited</b> for consumption due to the blood they absorb from the birds. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this ruling? <b>If</b> they were placed <b>in an unperforated vessel,</b> in which the blood emitted by the birds will pool, then <b>even</b> if one salted <b>a bird and</b> another <b>bird</b> together they should be <b>prohibited,</b> as the blood expelled from one bird will be absorbed by the other. And <b>if</b> the case involves <b>a perforated vessel,</b> out of which the blood can flow, then <b>even</b> if <b>fish</b> are salted with <b>birds</b> the fish should be <b>permitted.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the ruling is referring <b>to a perforated vessel. And</b> the <b>fish</b> are prohibited <b>because their skin is soft,</b> and therefore when they are salted <b>they expel</b> their blood <b>first, whereas</b> the skin of <b>birds</b> is <b>hard. After</b> the <b>fish finish</b> expelling their blood, the <b>birds</b> continue to <b>expel</b> their blood, <b>and then</b> the fish <b>absorb</b> blood <b>from them.</b> If one salts two birds together, they expel their blood simultaneously, and neither will absorb blood from outside while expelling its own.
The Gemara relates: <b>Meat of a slaughtered</b> animal <b>was salted for Rav Mari bar Raḥel together with</b> prohibited <b>meat of an animal that had a wound that would have caused it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> in a perforated vessel, as meat is generally salted. <b>He came before Rava</b> to ask whether the kosher meat was prohibited, as perhaps it would not have absorbed flavor from the non-kosher meat while itself expelling blood.
Rava <b>said to him:</b> When the verse states, with regard to forbidden foods: “These are <b>the unclean</b> to you” (Leviticus 11:31), the added definite article serves <b>to prohibit</b> not only their flesh but also <b>their juice</b> emitted by salting, <b>and their gravy, and their spices</b> with which they are cooked. Even while the kosher meat is emitting its blood, it still absorbs the juices of the non-kosher meat, which are absorbed more easily than blood.

Daf 113a

The Gemara objects: <b>But let</b> Rava <b>say to</b> him the same ruling by instead citing the seemingly more relevant statement <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel said: A salted</b> food imparts its flavor <b>like a boiling</b> food, <b>and a marinated</b> food <b>is</b> as absorbent <b>as a cooked</b> food. Clearly, the kosher meat absorbed flavor from the meat of the <i>tereifa</i> as it would have had they been cooked together.
The Gemara explains: <b>Had</b> Rava based his ruling only <b>on Shmuel’s</b> statement, <b>I would say</b> in response: <b>This statement</b> applies only to the absorption of <b>the blood of</b> the meat, <b>but</b> kosher meat is <b>not</b> prohibited if it absorbs only <b>the juices and gravy of</b> the meat of the <i>tereifa</i>. Since in this case the meat is salted in a perforated vessel, the blood from each piece runs out and is not absorbed by the other, and one might think that the kosher meat remains permitted. Rava’s interpretation of the verse in Leviticus <b>teaches us</b> that the juices and gravy of the meat of the <i>tereifa</i> must also be taken into account.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A kosher fish that one salted</b> together <b>with a non-kosher fish is permitted. What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where they were both salted</b> and expel juices? This indicates that the kosher fish is not prohibited by the juices of the non-kosher fish, contrary to Rava’s statement. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> this is referring to a case <b>where</b> the <b>kosher</b> fish was <b>salted and</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish was <b>unsalted.</b> Since an unsalted fish does not emit juices, the kosher fish does not absorb the flavor of the non-kosher fish.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches: But if</b> the <b>kosher</b> fish <b>was salted and</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish was <b>unsalted</b> the kosher fish remains permitted, <b>it may be inferred that</b> in <b>the first clause we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where they are both salted.</b> The Gemara responds: The latter clause <b>is explaining</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the first clause. The <i>baraita</i> should be read as follows: <b>A kosher</b> fish <b>that one salted</b> together <b>with a non-kosher fish is permitted. How so?</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>if</b> the <b>kosher</b> fish <b>was salted and</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish was <b>unsalted.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>So, too, it is reasonable</b> that this is the meaning of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>as if it enters your mind</b> that <b>the first clause</b> is referring to a case where <b>both of them are salted,</b> one can claim: <b>Now</b> that the <i>baraita</i> has stated that even if <b>both of them are salted</b> the kosher fish is <b>permitted, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that the same applies in the less problematic case where the <b>kosher</b> fish was <b>salted and</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish was <b>unsalted?</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>If it is due to that</b> reason, <b>there is no</b> conclusive <b>argument.</b> It is possible that the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> is indeed referring to a case where both fish are salted, and the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> nevertheless <b>taught the latter clause to shed light on the first clause,</b> so <b>that you</b> should <b>not say: The first clause</b> is referring only to a case where the <b>kosher</b> fish was <b>salted and</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish was <b>unsalted, but</b> if they were <b>both salted,</b> then the kosher fish is <b>prohibited.</b> To rule this out, he <b>taught the latter clause,</b> which explicitly makes reference to a case where the <b>kosher</b> fish was <b>salted and</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish <b>unsalted,</b> which <b>by inference</b> indicates <b>that the first clause</b> is referring to a case where they are <b>both salted, and</b> teaches that <b>even so</b> the kosher fish is <b>permitted.</b>
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof against Rava’s ruling <b>from the latter clause of the latter clause,</b> i.e., the third clause of that <i>baraita</i>: <b>But if</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish <b>was salted and</b> the <b>kosher</b> fish was <b>unsalted,</b> the kosher fish is <b>prohibited.</b> One can infer from here that <b>it is</b> only if the <b>non-kosher</b> fish is <b>salted and</b> the <b>kosher</b> fish is <b>unsalted that</b> the kosher fish is <b>prohibited. But</b> if they were <b>both salted,</b> then the kosher fish is <b>permitted,</b> contrary to Rava’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects this: Perhaps the last section of the <i>baraita</i> uses this language only <b>since</b> it <b>teaches</b> in <b>the former clause,</b> i.e., the second clause: If the <b>kosher</b> fish was <b>salted and</b> the <b>non-kosher</b> fish <b>unsalted,</b> etc. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>taught the last clause as well</b> using parallel language: If the <b>non-kosher</b> fish was <b>salted and</b> the <b>kosher</b> fish <b>unsalted,</b> etc. But nothing can be derived from here with regard to a case where both fish were salted.
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for remembering the three <i>halakhot</i> stated by Shmuel below: The manner in which blood is expelled from <b>meat;</b> salted meat <b>that is placed</b> on a vessel; an animal whose neck is broken before its soul <b>departs.</b>
<b>Shmuel says: Meat cannot be rid of its blood unless one salts it thoroughly and rinses it thoroughly</b> in water. <b>It was stated: Rav Huna says:</b> One must <b>salt and rinse</b> the meat in water. And it <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> One must <b>rinse</b> the meat, <b>and salt</b> it, <b>and</b> then <b>rinse</b> it again. The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> these two rulings <b>do not disagree. This</b> ruling of Rav Huna is referring to a case <b>where one</b> already <b>washed</b> the meat <b>in the slaughterhouse</b> before salting, whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where one did not wash</b> the meat <b>in the slaughterhouse.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Dimi of Neharde’a would salt</b> meat <b>with coarse salt and</b> then <b>shake</b> the salt off the meat.
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya says: One does not presume</b> that there is <b>blood in the intestines,</b> and therefore they are not prohibited if they have not been salted. The Gemara comments: The Sages <b>interpreted</b> this statement as referring <b>to the rectum, the intestines, and the spiral colon.</b>
<b>Shmuel says: One may place salted meat only on a perforated vessel,</b> so that the expelled blood can run out. But if the vessel is not perforated then the blood will pool and be reabsorbed by the meat.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Sheshet would salt</b> meat <b>one bone,</b> i.e., one piece, <b>at a time.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that he would <b>not</b> salt <b>two</b> together? Could it be <b>because</b> the blood <b>leaves this</b> piece <b>and that</b> piece <b>absorbs</b> it? If so, with regard to <b>one</b> piece <b>as well,</b> one could claim that the blood <b>leaves this side</b> of the piece <b>and that side absorbs</b> it. <b>Rather,</b> there <b>is no difference</b> between one piece and two pieces, and one may salt even several pieces together.
<b>Shmuel says in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya: One who breaks the neck of an animal</b> after it is slaughtered but <b>before its soul departs thereby makes the meat heavy.</b> The meat expels blood at the time of slaughter, but if one breaks the animal’s neck, excess blood is trapped inside and weighs down the meat. <b>And</b> by this action <b>he robs people,</b> as <b>he causes blood to be absorbed in the</b> animal’s <b>limbs,</b> and since he sells the meat by weight, people will pay extra to acquire the same amount of edible meat.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>what</b> case <b>is he speaking?</b> Does Shmuel mean that there is only one problem with this practice, namely, that it <b>renders the meat heavy and robs people since he causes blood to be absorbed in the</b> animal’s <b>limbs?</b> If so, it may be inferred that if one wishes to keep the meat <b>for himself,</b> one may <b>well</b> do so, since he is robbing no one. <b>Or perhaps</b> Shmuel is referring to two prohibitions, first, that the blood trapped in the meat renders it prohibited for consumption, and second, that of robbery. If so, then even if one wants to keep the meat <b>for himself,</b> it is <b>also prohibited.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who places</b> the meat of <b>birds with cheese on the table</b> upon which he eats <b>does not</b> thereby <b>violate</b> a Torah <b>prohibition.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: Since the mishna mentions only that placing meat of birds and milk on one table does not violate a Torah prohibition, one may <b>consequently</b> infer that if one <b>eats</b> them together he does <b>violate</b> a Torah <b>prohibition.</b> If so, <b>learn from</b> the mishna that <b>meat of birds in milk</b> is prohibited <b>by Torah law,</b> contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, who maintains that it applies by rabbinic law. The Gemara responds: <b>Say</b> that the mishna should be understood as follows: <b>One who places bird meat with cheese on the table will not</b> thereby <b>come to</b> violate a Torah <b>prohibition,</b> since eating the two together is a rabbinic prohibition, as Rabbi Akiva maintains.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> It is <b>prohibited to cook the meat of a kosher animal in the milk of</b> any <b>kosher animal,</b> not merely the milk of its mother, <b>and</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from that mixture is <b>prohibited.</b> It is <b>permitted to cook the meat of a kosher animal in the milk of a non-kosher animal,</b> or <b>the meat of a non-kosher animal in the milk of a kosher animal, and</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from that mixture is <b>permitted. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Cooking the meat of <b>an undomesticated animal or bird</b> in milk is <b>not</b> prohibited <b>by Torah law, as it is stated: “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Exodus 23:19, 34:26; Deuteronomy 14:21) <b>three times.</b> The repetition of the word “kid” three times <b>excludes an undomesticated animal, a bird, and a non-kosher animal.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says</b> that <b>it is stated: “You shall not eat of any animal carcass”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:21), <b>and</b> in the same verse <b>it is stated: “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk.”</b> This indicates that meat of an animal <b>that</b> is subject to be <b>prohibited due to</b> the prohibition of eating <b>an unslaughtered carcass</b> is <b>prohibited</b> for one <b>to cook in milk.</b> Consequently, with regard to meat of <b>birds, which</b> is subject to be <b>prohibited due to</b> the prohibition of eating <b>an unslaughtered carcass,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that it <b>would be prohibited to cook</b> it <b>in milk.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In its mother’s milk,” excluding a bird, which has no mother’s milk.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Elazar said: The verse states: “And Judah sent the kid of the goats”</b> (Genesis 38:20).

Daf 113b

One may infer that <b>here,</b> since this verse specifies that it is referring to <b>a kid of the goats, consequently, anywhere</b> the word <b>“kid” is stated without specification, it means even a cow or a ewe.</b> Accordingly, the prohibition of meat cooked in milk applies to all kosher domesticated animals.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>derive from</b> that verse that in general, every instance of the word “kid” is referring to a goat, including the prohibition of meat cooked in milk? The Gemara answers: This cannot be, as <b>another verse is written: “And the skins of the kids of the goats”</b> (Genesis 27:16). This indicates that only <b>here</b> they are <b>kids of the goats, but anywhere</b> the word <b>“kid” is stated without specification, it means even a cow or a ewe.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But let us derive from</b> this verse as well that on the contrary, the word “kid” is always referring to a goat. The Gemara explains: These two examples <b>are two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., to teach the same matter, <b>and</b> as a rule, <b>any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common element to other cases.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> this principle that two verses that come as one <b>do not teach</b> their common element to other cases, <b>but according to the one who says</b> that two verses that come as one do <b>teach</b> their common element to other cases, <b>what is there to say?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Two exclusions are written,</b> as both of the verses cited use the term “the goats.” The verses could have stated simply: <b>Goats,</b> but state <b>“the goats,”</b> with the definite article, teaching that it is only in these cases that the reference is specifically to a goat.
§ <b>Shmuel says:</b> Each of the Torah’s three mentions of the prohibition of not cooking a kid in its mother’s milk serves to include a different case. The first mention of the word <b>“kid”</b> serves <b>to include</b> liability for cooking in milk and eating forbidden <b>fats,</b> beyond the liability for eating forbidden fat per se. The second mention of the word <b>“kid”</b> likewise serves <b>to include</b> additional liability for cooking in milk and eating the meat of <b>a dead</b> animal carcass. Finally, the third mention of the word <b>“kid”</b> serves <b>to include</b> liability for cooking in milk and eating an animal <b>fetus.</b>
Each mention excludes a case as well: The first mention of the word <b>“kid”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> liability for cooking in milk and consuming <b>blood.</b> The second mention of the word <b>“kid”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> liability for cooking in milk and eating <b>the placenta</b> of an animal. The third mention of the word <b>“kid”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> liability for cooking in milk and eating the meat of <b>a non-kosher</b> animal.
Furthermore, the first instance of the phrase <b>“in its mother’s milk”</b> indicates that one is <b>not</b> liable for cooking meat <b>in the milk of a male</b> animal, in the rare case that a male might produce milk. The second instance of the phrase <b>“in its mother’s milk”</b> indicates that one is <b>not</b> liable for cooking meat <b>in the milk of</b> an already <b>slaughtered</b> animal, since it is considered milk only if given while the animal is alive. The third instance of the phrase <b>“in its mother’s milk”</b> indicates that one is <b>not</b> liable for cooking meat <b>in the milk of a non-kosher</b> animal.
The Gemara challenges: The word <b>“kid” is written</b> only <b>three</b> times, <b>and</b> yet <b>we expound</b> it to teach <b>six</b> different <i>halakhot</i>. The Gemara responds: <b>Shmuel maintains</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> even where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, <b>and</b> therefore the <b>prohibition of</b> forbidden <b>fat</b> in milk <b>and</b> the prohibition of <b>a dead</b> animal carcass in milk <b>are both derived from one verse,</b> as both are applications of the prohibition to an already prohibited item. The exclusion of <b>blood</b> from the prohibition <b>also</b> does not require its own verse, as blood <b>is not</b> considered <b>a kid</b> at all, <b>and likewise</b> there is no need for a verse to exclude <b>a placenta</b> from the prohibition, as it <b>is merely a secretion</b> of the animal, rather than a kind of meat. Therefore, <b>two</b> mentions of “kid” <b>are left; one</b> serves <b>to include a fetus, and one</b> serves <b>to exclude a non-kosher animal.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Shmuel</b> really <b>maintain</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists? <b>But didn’t Shmuel say in the name of Rabbi Elazar: From where</b> is it derived that <b>an impure priest who partakes of impure <i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., the portion of produce designated for the priest, <b>is not</b> punished <b>with death</b> at the hand of Heaven as he would had the <i>teruma</i> been ritually pure? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated,</b> with regard to the prohibition of an impure priest partaking of <i>teruma</i>: <b>“And die therein if they desecrate it”</b> (Leviticus 22:9), <b>to the exclusion of this</b> case of <i>teruma</i> that is impure, <b>which was already desecrated</b> before the priest ate it. Here, it seems, since impure <i>teruma</i> is already prohibited for consumption, the added prohibition of an impure priest partaking of <i>teruma</i> does not take effect.
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>in general</b> Shmuel maintains that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, and it <b>is different there,</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>, <b>as the Merciful One</b> expressly <b>excludes</b> impure <i>teruma</i> by the phrase <b>“and die therein</b> if they desecrate it,” and in this case the <i>teruma</i> is already desecrated. And <b>if you wish, say</b> that <b>in general Shmuel maintains</b> that <b>a prohibition does not take effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, <b>and here,</b> the case of meat cooked in milk, <b>is different, as the Merciful One</b> expressly <b>includes</b> the meat of an animal carcass and forbidden fat by the repetition of the word <b>“kid.”</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>this</b> statement of Shmuel with regard to meat cooked in milk is <b>his</b> own opinion, as he maintains that a prohibition takes effect where another prohibition already exists, and <b>that</b> statement with regard to <i>teruma</i> <b>is his teacher’s,</b> i.e., Rabbi Elazar’s, opinion, as he holds that a prohibition does not take effect where another prohibition already exists.
§ <b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami raised a dilemma to Rav:</b> If <b>one cooks</b> meat <b>in milk of a goat that has not</b> yet <b>nursed,</b> but that is about to give birth and already has milk, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav <b>said to him: From</b> the fact that <b>it was necessary for Shmuel to say</b> that the phrase <b>“in its mother’s milk”</b> teaches: <b>And not in the milk of a male</b> animal, one can infer that <b>it is</b> only the milk of <b>a male</b> that is excluded, as the male <b>cannot attain the status of a mother. But</b> in <b>this</b> case, <b>since</b> the goat <b>will attain the status of a mother,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to cook meat in its milk.
It <b>was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who cooks</b> forbidden <b>fat in milk, Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi</b> disagree as to the <i>halakha</i>. <b>One says</b> that he <b>is flogged</b> for violating the prohibition of meat cooked in milk, <b>and one says</b> that he <b>is not flogged.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>they disagree about this: That the one who says</b> he <b>is flogged maintains</b> that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, <b>and the one who says</b> he <b>is not flogged maintains</b> that <b>a prohibition does not take effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists.
The Gemara responds: <b>No; everyone</b> agrees that <b>a prohibition does not take effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, and therefore <b>everyone agrees that</b> one <b>is not flogged for eating</b> the mixture. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to cooking. The one who says</b> he <b>is flogged</b> holds that one who cooks violates only <b>one prohibition,</b> that of cooking meat in milk, since it is permitted to cook forbidden fat without eating it. Consequently, this is not a case of a prohibition taking effect where another prohibition already exists. <b>And the one who says</b> he <b>is not flogged</b> holds that it was <b>for this</b> reason that <b>the Merciful One expressed</b> the prohibition of <b>eating</b> meat cooked in milk in the Torah using <b>the language of cooking:</b> “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk.”

Daf 114a

This link between cooking and eating indicates that <b>since one is not flogged for eating</b> forbidden fat cooked in milk, as agreed upon above, one <b>also is not flogged for cooking</b> the two together.
<b>And some say</b> the opposite: <b>With regard to cooking, everyone agrees that</b> one <b>is flogged</b> for this act, since the principle of a prohibition not taking effect where another prohibition already exists is not relevant. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to eating. The one who says he is not flogged</b> applies the principle <b>that a prohibition does not take effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, and the fat was already prohibited for consumption in its own right before being cooked with milk. <b>And the one who says he is flogged</b> holds that it was <b>for this</b> reason that <b>the Merciful One expressed</b> the prohibition of <b>eating</b> meat cooked in milk using <b>the language of cooking,</b> to teach that <b>since one is flogged for cooking</b> forbidden fat in milk, one <b>also is flogged for eating</b> the product.
The Gemara suggests a third explanation of the dispute between Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi: <b>And if you wish, say</b> that <b>one Sage said one</b> statement <b>and one Sage said another</b> statement, <b>and they do not disagree,</b> as they are referring to different cases. The Sage who said that one is flogged is referring to the transgression of cooking forbidden fat with milk, whereas the one who said one is not flogged is referring to the consumption of forbidden fat with milk. Everyone agrees that a prohibition does not take effect where another prohibition already exists, and therefore one is flogged only for cooking forbidden fat in milk, but not for eating the two together.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>Tosefta</i> (8:3): <b>One who cooks</b> meat <b>in whey,</b> the liquid leftover after milk has been curdled, is <b>exempt</b> from lashes, as whey is not defined as milk for purposes of the prohibition. Likewise, for <b>blood that one cooked in milk,</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> as blood is not considered meat. Similarly, with regard to <b>the bones, the tendons, the horns, and the hooves that one cooked in milk,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
The <i>Tosefta</i> continues: By contrast, with regard to prohibited <b><i>piggul</i></b> meat, i.e., meat from an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to sprinkle its blood or partake of its meat beyond its designated time, <b>and</b> similarly prohibited <b><i>notar</i>,</b> meat from an offering whose period for consumption has expired, <b>and</b> the prohibited <b>impure</b> meat of an offering, <b>that one cooked in milk,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to be flogged for violating the prohibition of meat cooked in milk. This indicates that the prohibition applies to items already prohibited for consumption, contrary to the above opinion attributed to Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi.
The Gemara answers: <b>This <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>maintains</b> in general that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, whereas Rabbi Ami and Rabbi Asi are of the opposite opinion. It is conceivable that these Sages, who are <i>amora’im</i>, disagree with that <i>tanna</i>, as the issue of whether a prohibition takes effect where another prohibition already exists is a well-known dispute among the <i>tanna’im</i> themselves.
§ It was stated in the above <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who cooks</b> meat <b>in whey is exempt</b> from lashes. The Gemara comments: This ruling <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish, as we learned</b> in a mishna, with regard to liquids that render food susceptible to ritual impurity (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:5): The halakhic status of <b>whey is like</b> that of <b>milk,</b> which is one of the liquids that render food susceptible to impurity, <b>and</b> the halakhic status of olive <b>secretion is like</b> that of <b>oil,</b> which also renders food susceptible to impurity. With regard to this mishna, <b>Reish Lakish says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to <b>rendering seeds,</b> i.e., produce, <b>susceptible</b> to impurity. <b>But with regard to cooking meat in milk,</b> the halakhic status of <b>whey is not like</b> that of <b>milk.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the phrase <b>“in its mother’s milk” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the prohibition applies <b>to</b> the <b>mother</b> goat’s <b>milk. From where</b> do I derive that it also applies <b>to the milk of a cow and a ewe?</b>
<b>You</b> can <b>say an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>Just as</b> a kid’s <b>mother, which is not prohibited for mating with</b> the kid, as they are of the same species, <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>prohibited for cooking with it,</b> as stated in the verse, <b>is it not right that a cow or a ewe, which are prohibited for mating with it,</b> as they are of different species, <b>should be prohibited for cooking with it?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> elsewhere: <b>“In its mother’s milk,”</b> a second time, to include a cow and a ewe.
The Gemara challenges the conclusion of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>But why do I</b> need <b>a verse? It was</b> just <b>derived</b> through the <i>a fortiori</i> inference.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is needed <b>because one can say that</b> the <b>refutation of the</b> <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference</b> is present <b>from the outset,</b> i.e., there is a difficulty with the comparison: <b>From where do you derive</b> the inference? It is derived <b>from its mother</b> goat, which the <i>baraita</i> presents as being treated more leniently than a cow or ewe since it may be mated with a kid. But there is a stringent aspect of the mother goat not shared by a cow or ewe: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about its mother?</b> It is unique <b>in that it is prohibited for slaughter with it,</b> since one may not slaughter an animal and its mother on the same day (see Leviticus 22:28). <b>Will you say</b> the same <b>about a cow, which is not prohibited for slaughter with it?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In its mother’s milk,”</b> to include a cow and a ewe.
§ The above <i>baraita</i> accounts for two of the Torah’s three mentions of the phrase “in its mother’s milk.” The Gemara now addresses the third. It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: From one instance of the phrase <b>“in its mother’s milk” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the prohibition applies <b>to the milk of its mother,</b> if the mother is less than a year old and has not yet entered the pen for the purpose of its owner’s separating the annual animal tithe. <b>From where</b> do I derive that it also applies <b>to the milk of its older sister,</b> i.e., one that is more than a year old that has already entered the pen for the animal tithe in the previous year?
<b>You</b> can <b>say an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>Just as</b> a kid’s <b>mother, which enters the pen to be tithed with it, is</b> nevertheless <b>prohibited for cooking with it, is it not right that its sister, which does not enter the pen to be tithed with it, should be prohibited for cooking with it?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> elsewhere: <b>“In its mother’s milk,”</b> a third time, to include the older sister in the prohibition.
The Gemara asks: <b>But why do I</b> need <b>a verse? It was</b> just <b>derived</b> from the <i>a fortiori</i> inference. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is needed <b>because one can say</b> that the <b>refutation of</b> that <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference</b> is present <b>from the outset. From where do you derive</b> the inference? It is derived <b>from its mother.</b> But one may respond: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about its mother?</b> It is unique <b>in that it is prohibited for slaughter with it</b> on the same day. <b>Will you say</b> the same <i>halakhot</i> apply <b>to its older sister, which is not prohibited for slaughter with it?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In its mother’s milk,”</b> including the older sister.
The Gemara continues: <b>We have found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that <b>its older sister</b> is included in the prohibition of meat cooked in milk. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the same applies to <b>its younger sister,</b> one that has not yet entered the pen for the tithe? The Gemara responds: <b>It is derived from between them,</b> i.e., from the combination of the mother and the older sister.
The Gemara elaborates on the need for both cases in order to derive the third: <b>From which</b> of the two cases <b>should it be derived?</b> If <b>it should be derived from its mother,</b> one can claim: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about its mother?</b> It is unique <b>in that it is prohibited for slaughter with it</b> on the same day, unlike the younger sister. One may respond: <b>Its older sister can prove</b> the point, since it is not prohibited for slaughter with the kid, but it is still included in the prohibition of meat cooked in milk. But this can be refuted as well: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about its older sister?</b> It is unique <b>in that it does not enter the pen to be tithed with it,</b> unlike the younger sister. One may respond that <b>its mother can</b> then <b>prove</b> the point, as it can enter the pen to be tithed with the kid and is still included in the prohibition.
<b>And</b> consequently, <b>the inference has reverted</b> to its starting point: <b>The aspect of this</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case <b>and the aspect of that</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> case; <b>their common element</b> is <b>that</b> both the mother and older sister are <b>meat and</b> it is <b>prohibited to cook</b> them <b>in milk.</b> If so, <b>I will also include its younger sister</b> in the prohibition, <b>since it is</b> also <b>meat, and</b> therefore it is <b>prohibited to cook</b> it <b>in milk.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> the inclusion of <b>its older sister</b> in the prohibition can <b>also be derived from between them,</b> i.e., from the combination of the kid’s mother and a cow. Although both a cow and the mother possess unique stringencies not shared by the older sister, i.e., the prohibition of mating and of slaughtering with the kid, respectively, neither possesses both stringencies, and the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the older sister can be derived from their common element, i.e., that they are both meat and prohibited to cook in milk, as stated above. If so, what need is there to derive this <i>halakha</i> from the verse?
The Gemara responds: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so;</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the older sister is derived from the common denominator of the mother and a cow. <b>Rather, why do I</b> need the verse’s additional mention of the phrase <b>“in its mother’s milk?” It is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“In its mother’s milk,” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the prohibition to cook the kid <b>in its mother’s milk;</b>

Daf 114b

<b>from where</b> is it derived that the meat of a mother animal may not <b>itself</b> be cooked <b>in its</b> own <b>milk? Say an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>Just as</b> with regard to an issue <b>where</b> the <b>fruit is not prohibited with</b> the <b>fruit,</b> i.e., <b>slaughter,</b> as it is permitted to slaughter two offspring of one mother on one day, the <b>fruit is</b> nevertheless <b>prohibited for slaughter with the mother, is it not right that</b> with regard to an issue <b>where</b> the <b>fruit is prohibited with</b> the <b>fruit,</b> i.e., <b>cooking,</b> as it is prohibited to cook a mother’s offspring with its milk, the <b>fruit,</b> i.e., the milk, <b>should be prohibited for cooking with the mother?</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “In its mother’s milk,”</b> to prohibit the cooking of the meat of the mother in its own milk.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a verse? It was</b> just <b>derived</b> <i>a fortiori</i>. <b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami said:</b> The verse is necessary <b>because one can say</b> that the case of <b>a horse born of</b> both a stallion and <b>mare</b> but which is <b>the brother of a mule,</b> i.e., its mother also bore a mule after being impregnated by a donkey, <b>proves</b> this <i>a fortiori</i> inference invalid. <b>As</b> here the <b>fruit is prohibited with</b> the <b>fruit, but</b> the <b>fruit is permitted with the mother.</b> One may not mate a horse with a mule, but one may mate a horse with its mother.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>There it is the seed of the father that effects</b> the prohibition of mating the mule with the daughter horse. The two may not be paired for reasons unrelated to their status as offspring of one mother. This ruling therefore proves nothing about the hypothesis that if two fruit cannot be paired, one can learn by <i>a fortiori</i> inference that the fruit cannot be paired with the mother.
And this explanation must be true, <b>as</b> the case of <b>a mule born of</b> a donkey and <b>a mare</b> and which is <b>the brother of a female mule proves. As</b> here one <b>fruit is permitted with</b> the other <b>fruit,</b> i.e., one may mate the male and female mules since they are of the same species, <b>and</b> yet the <b>fruit is prohibited</b> to be mated <b>with the mother,</b> i.e., the mare. This case illustrates that the prohibition of crossbreeding is contingent on paternity, and does not rest solely on the relation between the mother and the fruit.
<b>Rather, Mar, son of Ravina, said:</b> The <i>a fortiori</i> inference is invalid <b>because one can say that</b> the case of a male Canaanite <b>slave born of a female slave</b> and who is <b>the brother of a female freed</b> slave <b>proves</b> it invalid. <b>As</b> here the <b>fruit is prohibited with</b> the <b>fruit,</b> i.e., the slave may not engage in sexual intercourse with his freed sister, <b>and</b> yet the <b>fruit is permitted with</b> his slave <b>mother.</b>
The Gemara rejects this as well: <b>There it is the bill of manumission that effects</b> the prohibition. The slave is prohibited to his sister only because she has been freed, not because they are both fruit of one mother, <b>as</b> the case of a male <b>slave, son of a female freed</b> slave, and <b>the brother of a female slave proves. As</b> here the <b>fruit is permitted with</b> the <b>fruit,</b> i.e., he is permitted to his sister, since they are both slaves, <b>and</b> yet the <b>fruit is prohibited with</b> his released <b>mother,</b> as she is now considered a full-fledged Jew. Clearly the prohibition is entirely contingent on the emancipation of one of the slaves, irrespective of their relationship.
<b>Rather, Rav Idi bar Avin said:</b> The <i>a fortiori</i> inference is invalid <b>because one can say</b> that the case of <b>diverse kinds of seeds proves</b> it invalid. <b>As</b> it <b>is prohibited</b> to sow <b>fruit</b> of one species <b>with fruit</b> of another species, <b>and</b> yet it is <b>permitted</b> to sow all types of <b>fruit with the mother,</b> i.e., the ground, from which all fruit grows. The Gemara rejects this as well: <b>Isn’t fruit</b> of one species <b>with fruit</b> of another species <b>prohibited only by means of the mother,</b> i.e., the ground? The prohibition of sowing diverse seeds applies only when they are both sown in the ground, <b>as wheat and barley</b> can be placed <b>in</b> a single <b>jug and they are not prohibited.</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said:</b> The <i>a fortiori</i> inference is invalid <b>because one can say: What</b> is unique <b>about fruit with fruit,</b> e.g., the kid and its mother’s milk, which are prohibited for cooking together? They are unique <b>in that</b> they are <b>two</b> separate <b>bodies</b> that were never unified. Must <b>you say</b> the same prohibition of pairing applies <b>to</b> the <b>fruit with the mother,</b> i.e., the mother’s meat and its milk, <b>which</b> were once <b>one body? Due to this</b> reason, <b>the</b> extra <b>verse</b> stating: “In its mother’s milk,” <b>was necessary</b> to include the meat and milk of the same animal in the prohibition.
§ <b>Rav Ashi says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that meat</b> cooked <b>in milk is prohibited for consumption,</b> even though the verse explicitly prohibits only cooking? It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated</b> elsewhere: <b>“You shall not eat any abominable thing”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:3). This verse teaches that with regard to <b>any</b> practice <b>that I have made abominable,</b> i.e., forbidden, <b>to you,</b> the product <b>is prohibited for consumption.</b>
<b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that meat cooked in milk is prohibited <b>with regard to consumption; from where</b> do I derive that it is also prohibited <b>with regard to benefit?</b> It is derived <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Wherever it is stated, “He shall not eat,”</b> or <b>“you,”</b> in the singular, <b>“shall not eat,”</b> or <b>“you,”</b> in the plural, <b>“shall not eat,” both a prohibition</b> against <b>eating and a prohibition</b> against deriving <b>benefit</b> are indicated. This is so <b>unless the verse specifies for you</b> that one may derive benefit, <b>in the manner that it specified for you with regard to an animal carcass,</b> from which the verse explicitly permits one to derive benefit, as it states: “You may sell it to a foreigner” (Deuteronomy 14:21). Accordingly, one may provide such meat <b>to</b> a gentile <b>resident alien</b> in Eretz Yisrael <b>by giving</b> it to him as a gift, <b>and to</b> any other <b>gentile by sale.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“You shall not eat of any unslaughtered animal carcass; you may give it to the resident alien who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner;</b> for you are a sacred people to the Lord your God.” From this verse <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it is permitted to provide such meat <b>to a resident alien through giving and to a gentile through selling. From where</b> is it derived that it is permitted to transfer an unslaughtered animal <b>to a resident alien through selling</b> as well? <b>The verse states: “You may give it to the stranger…or you may sell it,”</b> indicating that one has the option to do either of these.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> is it derived that it is permitted <b>to a gentile through giving</b> as well? <b>The verse states: “You may give it</b>…<b>or you may sell it to a foreigner.”</b> Consequently, <b>one finds</b> that he may transfer an animal carcass to <b>both a resident alien and a gentile, both through selling or through giving.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> These <b>matters are</b> to be understood <b>as they are written;</b> one may transfer an unslaughtered animal carcass <b>to a resident alien</b> only <b>through giving, and to a gentile</b> only <b>through selling.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara responds: Rabbi Yehuda holds that <b>if it enters your mind</b> to understand the verse <b>in accordance</b> with that which <b>Rabbi Meir says,</b> then <b>let the Merciful One write: You shall not eat of any animal carcass, you may give it to the resident alien who is within your gates that he may eat it and</b> also <b>you may sell it</b> to a foreigner. <b>Why do I</b> need the word <b>“or”</b> between these two options? <b>Learn from it that it comes to</b> teach that the <b>matters are</b> to be understood <b>as they are written: To a resident alien through giving</b> alone, <b>and to</b> any other <b>gentile through selling.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Meir</b> explain the wording of the verse? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Meir could <b>say to you</b> that <b>this</b> word <b>“or”</b> teaches one <b>to prioritize to giving to a resident alien over selling to a gentile. And Rabbi Yehuda</b> holds that the <b>priority of giving to a resident alien over selling to a gentile does not require a verse,</b> as <b>it is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning: You are commanded</b> by the Torah <b>to sustain this</b> resident alien, <b>but you are not commanded to sustain that</b> gentile.
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the topics that will be discussed: <b>Shabbat; plows; and diverse kinds of seeds; a mother and its offspring; and sending</b> away of the mother bird from <b>the nest.</b>
Rav Ashi stated above that the product of any practice described in the Torah as abominable is prohibited for consumption. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b>

Daf 115a

then <b>let</b> the product of <b>an action</b> that desecrates <b>Shabbat,</b> e.g., food cooked on Shabbat, <b>be prohibited</b> for consumption, <b>as</b> desecration of Shabbat <b>is</b> a practice of which God states: <b>I have made</b> it <b>abominable to you,</b> in that it is prohibited to cook on Shabbat. How can this food be prohibited only to the one who cooked it as a penalty by rabbinic law, but be permitted to others (see 15a)?
The Gemara answers: A product of the desecration of Shabbat is an exception to the rule, as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to Shabbat: <b>“For it is sacred to you”</b> (Exodus 31:14). One may infer: <b>It,</b> Shabbat itself, <b>is sacred, but</b> the products of <b>actions</b> that desecrate <b>it are not sacred,</b> i.e., not prohibited.
The Gemara raises another difficulty: If <b>one plows with an ox and with a donkey</b> together, thereby violating the prohibition in Deuteronomy 22:10, <b>or</b> if <b>one muzzles the mouth of a cow and threshes with it,</b> thereby violating the prohibition in Deuteronomy 25:4, the seeds or threshed grain <b>should be prohibited</b> for consumption according to the above principle, <b>as</b> these are both practices <b>I have made abominable to you.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>Now</b> that it has been established that products of desecration of Shabbat are permitted, one can derive the following using an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>Shabbat, which is</b> treated more <b>stringently,</b> the products of prohibited <b>actions are permitted;</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> with regard to <b>these</b> prohibitions of plowing with an ox and a donkey and threshing with a muzzled animal, which are treated less stringently, that the products of prohibited actions should be permitted?
The Gemara challenges: <b>Diverse kinds of seeds</b> sown together <b>should be prohibited</b> for consumption, <b>as</b> this <b>is</b> a matter whose practice <b>I have made abominable to you.</b> The Gemara explains: One learns otherwise <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One revealed with regard to diverse kinds in a vineyard:</b> “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed; <b>lest</b> the growth of the seed that you will sow <b>be forfeited [<i>pen tikdash</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:9). The Sages read the phrase “be forfeited [<i>pen tikdash</i>]” as though it states: <b>Lest it be burned [<i>pen tukad esh</i>],</b> indicating that diverse kinds in a vineyard must be destroyed so that no benefit is derived from them. Since this is stated specifically with regard to a vineyard, one can conclude <b>by inference that</b> other <b>diverse kinds of seeds are permitted.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But say</b> instead that the uniqueness of <b>diverse kinds in a vineyard</b> is that they <b>are prohibited both for consumption and for benefit,</b> whereas <b>diverse kinds of seeds are prohibited for consumption</b> but <b>are permitted for benefit.</b> The Gemara responds: One cannot say that diverse kinds of seeds are prohibited for consumption, as <b>they are juxtaposed</b> in the Torah <b>to diverse kinds of animals,</b> whose offspring are permitted. <b>As it is written: “You shall not let your cattle mate with a diverse kind; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed”</b> (Leviticus 19:19). The juxtaposition teaches that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>your cattle,</b> the animal <b>that comes from</b> diverse species <b>is permitted, so too,</b> with regard to <b>your field, that</b> produce <b>that comes from</b> diverse seeds <b>is permitted.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>diverse kinds of animals themselves, from where do we</b> derive that their offspring is permitted? The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One prohibits</b> the offspring of <b>diverse kinds</b> of animals for sacrifice <b>to the Most High</b> upon the altar (see 38b), learn <b>by inference that they are permitted to ordinary</b> people for consumption.
The Gemara raises another difficulty: <b>A mother and its offspring</b> slaughtered on the same day <b>should be prohibited</b> for consumption, as this too is a practice made abominable. The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One prohibits</b> an animal <b>whose time has not yet</b> arrived, i.e., that is less than eight days old, as an offering <b>to the Most High</b> (Leviticus 22:27), learn <b>by inference that</b> such animals are <b>permitted to ordinary</b> people for consumption. The offspring of a mother slaughtered that day is also considered an animal whose time has not yet arrived, since the prohibition against slaughtering it is limited to that day.
The Gemara raises a final difficulty: If one violated the mitzva that mandates <b>sending</b> away the mother bird from <b>the nest,</b> as it is stated: “You shall not take the mother with the young. You shall in any way let the mother go” (Deuteronomy 22:6–7), and the court instructed him to set the mother bird free, that mother bird <b>should be prohibited</b> to all, as this practice is also abominable. The Gemara responds: <b>The Torah did not say: Send</b> it away, if doing so could lead <b>to a mishap.</b> If the bird were prohibited, the Torah would not have commanded one to send it away, as others might eat it unwittingly.
§ <b>Reish Lakish says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that meat</b> cooked <b>in milk is prohibited</b> for consumption? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“You shall not eat it partially roasted, nor boiled in any way”</b> (Exodus 12:9). <b>As</b> there is <b>no</b> need for <b>the verse to state:</b> “Boiled <b>in any way,”</b> since it could simply have stated: “Boiled.” <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states:</b> “Boiled <b>in any way?”</b> It is included <b>to tell you</b> that <b>there is another</b> manner of <b>cooking,</b> the product of <b>which is</b> prohibited <b>like this one. And which</b> cooking <b>is this? This is meat</b> cooked <b>in milk.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to</b> Reish Lakish:

Daf 115b

<b>Is that</b> derivation <b>that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught ugly,</b> that you derive a new one? The verse states with regard to an animal’s blood: “You shall not eat it; you shall pour it upon the earth as water” (Deuteronomy 12:24), and the next verse adds: <b>“You shall not eat it;</b> that it may go well with you, and with your children after you.” Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi teaches that the redundant second verse is not referring to the prohibition of blood. Rather, <b>the verse is speaking of</b> the prohibition of <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk,</b> teaching that it is prohibited for consumption.
<b>Do you say</b> that <b>the verse is speaking of</b> the prohibition of <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk? Or</b> perhaps <b>it is only</b> referring <b>to one of the</b> other <b>prohibitions in the Torah? You say: Go out and learn from the thirteen hermeneutical principles,</b> one of which is: <b>A matter that is derived from its context. To what are the</b> adjacent <b>verses referring?</b> They are referring <b>to</b> consecrated animals that were redeemed, which are a combination of <b>two types:</b> They are non-sacred in that they may be eaten, but they are prohibited for shearing and work, like consecrated animals. <b>Here too,</b> one may conclude that the verse is referring <b>to</b> a prohibition that involves <b>two types</b> of food, i.e., the prohibition of meat cooked in milk.
Reish Lakish replied to Rabbi Yoḥanan: My exposition is still necessary, since <b>if</b> the source for the prohibition of eating meat cooked in milk were <b>from that</b> verse cited by Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi alone, <b>I would say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>to</b> the prohibition of <b>eating</b> meat cooked in milk, <b>but not to</b> that of deriving <b>benefit</b> from it. The verse cited with regard to the Paschal offering <b>teaches us</b> that even deriving benefit is prohibited, just as it is prohibited to derive benefit from a disqualified Paschal offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>from where</b> does he derive that meat cooked in milk is prohibited <b>for benefit?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>He derives it from here,</b> as <b>it is stated here: “For you are a sacred [<i>kadosh</i>] people unto the Lord</b> your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And it is stated below: “Neither shall there be a sodomite [<i>kadesh</i>] of the sons of Israel”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:18). The similar expressions teach that <b>just as below,</b> the prohibition of sodomy is a prohibition that involves enjoyment, i.e., deriving <b>benefit,</b> not eating, <b>so too here,</b> meat cooked in milk is prohibited <b>with regard to</b> deriving <b>benefit.</b>
<b>The school of Rabbi Eliezer taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“You shall not eat of any animal carcass;</b> you may give it to the stranger who is within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to a foreigner; for you are a sacred people to the Lord your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>The Torah stated</b> the prohibition of meat cooked in milk after the <i>halakha</i> of an animal carcass to teach that <b>when you sell</b> a carcass to a gentile, <b>you shall not cook it</b> in milk <b>and</b> then <b>sell it,</b> i.e., meat cooked in milk is prohibited for benefit and may not be sold.
<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The Torah states <b>three times: “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk”</b> (Exodus 23:19, 34:26; Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>One</b> verse serves <b>to</b> teach <b>the prohibition</b> against <b>eating</b> meat cooked in milk, <b>and one</b> serves <b>to</b> teach <b>the prohibition</b> against deriving <b>benefit</b> from it, <b>and one</b> serves <b>to</b> teach <b>the prohibition</b> against <b>cooking</b> meat in milk.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Isi ben Yehuda says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that it is prohibited</b> to eat <b>meat</b> cooked <b>in milk? It is stated here: “For you are a sacred people</b> unto the Lord your God. You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21). <b>And it is stated below: “And you shall be sacred men unto Me; therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn of animals in the field [<i>tereifa</i>];</b> you shall cast it to the dogs” (Exodus 22:30). <b>Just as below it is prohibited</b> to eat a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>so too here it is prohibited</b> to eat meat cooked in milk.
<b>And</b> from this <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it is prohibited <b>for consumption. From where</b> do I derive that it is prohibited <b>for benefit</b> as well? <b>You</b> can <b>say</b> it can be derived by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the prohibition against eating <b>the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting [<i>orla</i>],</b> which is treated less stringently <b>as no sin has been committed in</b> the planting of the tree and its production of fruit, <b>it is prohibited for benefit, is it not right that meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, with regard to which a sin has been committed, should be prohibited for benefit?</b>
The Gemara rejects this, as <i>orla</i> exhibits a unique stringency: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about <i>orla</i>?</b> It is unique <b>in that it never had a time when it was fit.</b> The same cannot be said about meat and milk, which were each permitted on their own before being cooked together.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let leavened bread on Passover prove</b> the point, <b>as it had a time when it was fit,</b> before Passover, <b>and</b> yet <b>it is prohibited for benefit.</b> The Gemara rejects this inference as well: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about</b> consumption of <b>leavened bread on Passover?</b> It is unique <b>in that it is punishable by <i>karet</i>,</b> unlike the prohibition of meat cooked in milk.
The Gemara comments: <b>Let</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds in a vineyard prove</b> the point, <b>as</b> it <b>is not punishable by <i>karet</i>, and</b> yet <b>it is prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from the product.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need both Isi ben Yehuda’s <b>verbal analogy</b> to teach the prohibition of consumption and the <i>a fortiori</i> inference to teach the prohibition of benefit? <b>Let all of it,</b> both the prohibition of consumption and the prohibition against deriving benefit, <b>be derived</b> by an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from <i>orla</i>: Just as <i>orla</i>,</b> which is treated less stringently, <b>as no sin has been committed in</b> the tree’s planting, is nevertheless <b>prohibited both for consumption and for benefit; is it not right that meat</b> cooked <b>in milk, with regard to which a sin has been committed,</b> should be <b>prohibited both for consumption and for benefit?</b>
The Gemara responds: That inference would be invalid <b>because one could say:</b> The cases of one <b>who plows with an ox and with a donkey, and</b> one <b>who muzzles the mouth of a cow and threshes with it prove</b> it invalid. <b>As</b> in those cases, <b>a sin has been committed through them, and</b> yet benefit from the products of these actions is <b>permitted.</b> One cannot refute a verbal analogy with logical reasoning.
The Gemara asks further: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>to say,</b> as was stated above, that the case of <b>diverse kinds in a vineyard proves</b> that benefit from meat and milk is prohibited? At that point, two other cases, <i>orla</i> and leavened bread on Passover, had already been offered as proof. Although they were rejected because they both possess a unique stringency, each lacks the stringency possessed by the other. Therefore, <b>let us say</b> that the case of <b><i>orla</i> proves</b> that the stringency for consumption of leavened bread on Passover, i.e., the penalty of <i>karet</i>, is irrelevant, and vice versa. <b>And let the inference revert</b> to its starting point, <b>and let</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to meat cooked in milk <b>be derived by</b> analogy from <b>the common element</b> of the two sources, i.e., the prohibition against both consumption and benefit.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> Such a derivation cannot be suggested, <b>because one can say</b> that the case of an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass proves</b> it invalid, <b>as</b> an animal carcass <b>is prohibited for consumption and</b> yet <b>it is permitted for benefit.</b>
<b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: We say in the name of Reish Lakish as follows:</b> For <b>any</b> analogy derived from <b>the common element</b> of two sources, <b>one can refute</b> the analogy only <b>by</b> invoking conflicting details of the two sources <b>themselves,</b> e.g., here, some stringency shared by <i>orla</i> and leavened bread, but not by meat cooked in milk. <b>One cannot refute</b> the analogy <b>from an external</b> case, as you do.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then the question remains: Why not <b>let</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>be derived by</b> analogy from <b>the common element</b> of <i>orla</i> and leavened bread on Passover? The Gemara responds: <b>Because</b> the analogy <b>can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about the common element of</b> <i>orla</i> and leavened bread? It is unique <b>in that</b> they both involve produce <b>that grows from the ground,</b> whereas meat and milk do not grow from the ground.
The Gemara counters: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even now</b> that the Gemara has invoked diverse kinds in a vineyard to prove the point, the derivation <b>can be refuted</b> in the same manner: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds in a vineyard?</b> It is unique <b>in that</b> it involves produce <b>that grows from the ground.</b>
<b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: We say in the name of Reish Lakish as follows:</b> For <b>any</b> analogy derived from <b>the common element</b> of two sources, <b>one can refute</b> the analogy by invoking <b>any</b> factor shared by the two source cases but not by the target case. But this is insufficient to refute an analogy to <b>a single</b> source <b>from a single</b> source using the standard formulation: <b>No, if you say</b> the <i>halakha</i> applies to the source case, which possesses a unique factor X, must you say the same of the target case, which does not? <b>One can refute</b> such analogies using this formulation only by way of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, i.e., if the unique factor X is a stringency. But <b>one cannot refute</b> it by simply mentioning <b>any</b> unique factor, e.g., that diverse kinds in a vineyard grow from the ground.
The Gemara counters: <b>But</b> one need not invoke the case of diverse kinds in a vineyard by itself, since it is invoked in addition to the cases of <i>orla</i> and leavened bread. Consequently, this is effectively a derivation from the common element of all three sources, not from one single case to another. If so, <b>let us refute</b> the derivation from <b>all of them: What</b> is unique <b>about all of</b> the cases? They are unique <b>in that</b> they involve produce <b>that grows from the ground.</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: We say in the name of Reish Lakish as follows:</b>

Daf 116a

As stated above, for any <i>a fortiori</i> inference of <b>a single</b> source <b>from a single</b> source, <b>one can refute</b> the derivation by invoking a unique <b>leniency</b> in the supposedly stringent case <b>and a stringency</b> in the lenient one, but <b>one cannot refute</b> it by simply mentioning <b>any</b> aspect unique to the first source. And for inferences of <b>one</b> source from <b>two other</b> sources <b>one can even refute</b> the derivation by mentioning <b>any</b> aspect unique to the first source.
For inferences of <b>one</b> source <b>from three</b> other sources, as suggested here, only <b>if the inference reverts</b> to its starting point, as each source possesses its own unique stringency, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> then <b>derived by</b> analogy from <b>the common element</b> of all of them, <b>can one refute</b> the inference by mentioning <b>any</b> factor unique to the source cases. <b>But if</b> the inference does <b>not</b> revert, <b>one can refute</b> the derivation only by invoking <b>a leniency and a stringency,</b> but <b>one cannot refute</b> it by mentioning <b>any</b> unique factor. The suggested inference does not revert, since the prohibition of diverse kinds in a vineyard possesses no stringent element that the other sources lack. Therefore, the fact that all the source cases involve produce is immaterial, and the inference from diverse kinds in a vineyard stands.
The Gemara suggests: <b>But let one refute</b> the inference as follows: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about diverse kinds in a vineyard?</b> They are unique <b>in that they had no time that they were fit.</b> The produce is forbidden as soon as it begins to grow, whereas meat and milk are prohibited only when they are cooked together. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> If this suggestion was not employed, <b>that is to say that</b> even <b>the roots of diverse kinds in a vineyard are prohibited,</b> including the seeds and saplings from which the hybrid plants grow. <b>And they</b> too <b>had a time when they were fit, before taking root.</b> Consequently, the premise of the question must be false.
<b>Rav Shemaya bar Zeira raises an objection</b> to this conclusion from a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:8): If <b>one transfers a perforated pot</b> with seeds in it <b>into a vineyard, if</b> the size of the plant growing in the pot <b>increases</b> by one <b>two-hundredth</b> of its previous size, such that the permitted original plant is less than two hundred times the amount of the prohibited growth and insufficient to nullify it, the produce is <b>prohibited,</b> due to the prohibition against planting diverse kinds in a vineyard. One may infer: If it <b>increases, yes,</b> it is prohibited; but if it <b>does not increase, no,</b> it is permitted. Apparently, only the additional growth is prohibited, not the planted seeds or saplings.
<b>Abaye said: Two verses are written,</b> i.e., two separate terms in one verse indicate two separate prohibitions: The verse states: “You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, lest the growth of the seed that you will sow be forfeited together with the increase of the vineyard” (Deuteronomy 22:9). <b>It is written: “Lest the growth be forfeited,”</b> indicating that it is prohibited only if it has grown, <b>and it is written: “Of the seed,”</b> from which it can be inferred that it is prohibited immediately when it is planted and takes root.
<b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? Abaye explains: If it was <b>planted initially</b> in the vineyard, it becomes prohibited immediately <b>upon taking root.</b> But in a case where it was <b>planted</b> elsewhere <b>and brought</b> into the vineyard later, e.g., in a perforated pot, then one must distinguish: If its size <b>increases</b> in the vineyard, <b>yes,</b> the growth is prohibited; if its size <b>does not increase, no,</b> it is not prohibited.
The Gemara notes: <b>The mishna,</b> which states that meat cooked in milk is prohibited for benefit, <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> It is <b>prohibited to eat meat</b> cooked <b>in milk but</b> it is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it, <b>as it is stated: “For you are a holy people</b> to the Lord your God; you shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Deuteronomy 14:21). And the verse <b>states elsewhere: “And you shall be holy people to Me;</b> therefore you shall not eat any flesh that is torn by animals [<i>tereifa</i>] in the field; you shall throw it to the dogs” (Exodus 22:30).
The use of the word “holy” in both verses indicates that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, it <b>is prohibited to eat</b> it <b>but</b> one <b>is permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it, as one may give it to the dogs, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to meat cooked in milk, it <b>is prohibited to eat</b> it <b>but</b> one is <b>permitted to</b> derive <b>benefit</b> from it.
§ The mishna states: <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> Cooking the meat of <b>an undomesticated animal or a bird</b> in milk is not prohibited by Torah law, as it is stated: “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk” (Exodus 23:19, 34:26; Deuteronomy 14:21), three times, excluding an undomesticated animal, a bird, and a non-kosher animal. The Gemara raises a difficulty: Other <i>halakhot</i> have already <b>been derived from these</b> mentions of the word “kid,” <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Shmuel</b> (see 113b).
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Akiva maintains</b> in general that <b>a prohibition takes effect</b> even where another <b>prohibition</b> already exists, <b>and</b> therefore forbidden <b>fat and</b> the meat of <b>a dead</b> animal, which are already prohibited, <b>do not require a verse</b> to teach that the prohibition of meat and milk applies to them. Furthermore, there is no need to derive from a verse that <b>a fetus</b> is included, as <b>it is a full-fledged kid.</b> Consequently, <b>all</b> three mentions of the word <b>remain for him</b> to expound that they serve <b>to exclude an undomesticated animal and a bird and a non-kosher animal.</b>
§ The mishna further teaches that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: It is stated: “You shall not eat</b> of any animal carcass” (Deuteronomy 14:21), and in the same verse it is stated: “You shall not cook a kid in its mother’s milk.” This indicates that the meat of an animal that is subject to be prohibited due to the prohibition of eating an unslaughtered carcass is prohibited to cook in milk. Consequently, one might have thought it is prohibited to cook in milk the meat of a bird, which is subject to this prohibition. Therefore, the verse states: “In its mother’s milk,” to exclude a bird, which has no mother’s milk. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> who excludes a bird from the prohibition of meat and milk due to the phrase “in its mother’s milk,” <b>and</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who comes to the same conclusion as Rabbi Yosei HaGelili based upon the phrase “You shall not cook a kid”?
The Gemara explains: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to <b>an undomesticated animal. Rabbi Yosei HaGelili maintains</b> that the prohibition of cooking the meat of <b>an undomesticated animal</b> in milk applies <b>by Torah law,</b> as an undomesticated animal has mother’s milk, <b>but Rabbi Akiva maintains</b> that the prohibition of cooking the meat of <b>an undomesticated animal</b> in milk applies only <b>by rabbinic law,</b> as it is excluded by the phrase: “You shall not cook a kid.”
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead that there is a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the meat of <b>a bird</b> itself: <b>Rabbi Akiva maintains</b> that the prohibitions of <b>an undomesticated animal and a bird do not</b> apply <b>by Torah law; but</b> it may be inferred from his statement that <b>they are prohibited by rabbinic law. And Rabbi Yosei HaGelili maintains</b> that <b>a bird is not prohibited even by rabbinic law.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>That</b> distinction <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In the locale of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> where his ruling was followed, <b>they would cut down trees</b> on Shabbat <b>to prepare charcoal</b> from them with which to light a fire <b>to fashion iron</b> tools with which to circumcise a child on Shabbat. In Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, not only does the mitzva of circumcision override Shabbat, but also any action required for the preparation of the tools necessary for the circumcision likewise overrides Shabbat. The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>In the locale of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili they would eat bird meat</b> cooked <b>in milk.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili maintains that the prohibition of meat cooked in milk does not include birds.
The Gemara relates: <b>Levi happened</b> to come <b>to the house of Yosef the bird hunter [<i>rishba</i>]. They served him the head of a peacock [<i>tayvasa</i>] in milk and he did not say anything to them. When</b> Levi <b>came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: Why did you not excommunicate</b> these people who eat bird meat cooked in milk, contrary to the decree of the Sages?
Levi <b>said to him: It was</b> in <b>the locale</b> of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira, and I said:</b> Perhaps <b>he taught them</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who said</b> that the phrase “in its mother’s milk” serves to <b>exclude a bird, which does not have mother’s milk.</b> If so, I could not prohibit it to them, and I certainly could not excommunicate them for following their ruling.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The congealed milk in <b>the stomach</b> of the animal <b>of a gentile and of an</b> unslaughtered <b>animal carcass is prohibited.</b> With regard to <b>one who curdled milk by</b> using <b>the skin of the stomach of a kosher</b> animal as a coagulant to make cheese, which may then have the taste of meat cooked in milk,

Daf 116b

<b>if</b> the measure of the skin is enough <b>to impart flavor</b> to the milk, <b>that</b> cheese <b>is prohibited.</b> In the case of <b>a kosher</b> animal <b>that suckled</b> milk <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> the milk in <b>its stomach is prohibited,</b> as the milk is from the <i>tereifa</i>. If it was <b>a <i>tereifa</i> that suckled</b> milk <b>from a kosher</b> animal, the milk in <b>its stomach is permitted,</b> as the milk is from the kosher animal. In both cases, the milk that an animal suckles has the status of the animal from which it was suckled, and not that of the animal which suckled, <b>because</b> the milk <b>is collected in its innards</b> and is not an integral part of its body.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna makes reference to the stomach of the animal of a gentile and that of an unslaughtered carcass. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>the stomach of</b> an animal slaughtered by <b>a gentile is not</b> itself <b>a carcass?</b> Why does the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna differentiate between them? <b>Rav Huna said:</b> The mishna <b>here</b> is not referring to an animal slaughtered by a gentile. Rather, <b>we are dealing with</b> a Jew who <b>purchases a kid from a gentile</b> and slaughters it himself. Therefore, the kid is not prohibited as a carcass, <b>but we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps it suckled from a <i>tereifa</i></b> animal, and it is therefore prohibited.
The Gemara asks: <b>And are we concerned</b> that <b>perhaps it suckled from</b> an animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>? But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:8): <b>One may purchase eggs from gentiles, and we are not concerned</b> that perhaps the eggs came <b>from a carcass nor</b> that they came <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: Indeed, there is no concern that the kid might have suckled from a <i>tereifa</i>. <b>Rather, say</b> that <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps it suckled from a non-kosher</b> animal, and therefore the milk in its stomach is prohibited.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about <b>a <i>tereifa</i> that we are not concerned</b> that perhaps the animal suckled from it, <b>and what is different</b> about <b>a non-kosher</b> animal <b>that we are concerned?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>A <i>tereifa</i></b> animal <b>is not common,</b> whereas <b>a non-kosher</b> animal <b>is common,</b> and it is therefore more likely that the young animal suckled from one.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If</b> suckling from a non-kosher animal is <b>common,</b> then <b>let us be concerned even with regard to our</b> own animals. The Gemara responds: <b>We</b> Jews, <b>who separate ourselves from</b> non-kosher animals, <b>when we see them we</b> immediately <b>distance</b> our suckling animals from them. Therefore, <b>the Sages did not issue a decree with regard to</b> animals purchased from Jews. But as for the gentiles, <b>who do not separate themselves from</b> non-kosher animals, <b>when they see them they do not distance</b> their kosher animals from them. Consequently, <b>the Sages issued a decree with regard to</b> animals purchased from a gentile.
<b>And Shmuel said</b> a different explanation of the mishna’s language: The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>is teaching</b> only <b>one</b> <i>halakha</i>: The congealed milk in <b>the stomach of</b> an animal <b>slaughtered by a gentile is</b> like <b>a carcass,</b> and it is therefore prohibited.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say this?</b> Does he hold that the milk in the stomach of an unslaughtered animal is prohibited as if it were part of its body? <b>But didn’t Shmuel say: For what</b> reason did the Sages <b>prohibit the cheese of gentiles?</b> It is <b>because they curdle it with the skin of the stomach of a carcass.</b> One may infer <b>consequently</b> that congealed milk, or rennet, from the <b>stomach</b> of a gentile’s animal <b>is itself permitted</b> and would not render the cheese prohibited if used as a coagulant.
The Gemara answers: That is <b>not difficult.</b> Elsewhere (<i>Avoda Zara</i> 29b), Rabbi Yehoshua teaches two reasons for the prohibition on gentile cheese. Initially, he held it to be prohibited because it is curdled using rennet from the stomach of an animal carcass. He later adopted the opinion that such rennet is permitted, and that the cheese is prohibited because it is curdled using rennet from the stomach of calves used for idol worship, which is prohibited. Therefore, the mishna <b>here,</b> which states that the rennet in a carcass’s stomach is itself prohibited, was taught <b>before</b> Rabbi Yehoshua’s <b>retraction,</b> while Shmuel’s statement <b>there,</b> that the Sages prohibited gentile cheese only because it is curdled with the skin of the stomach of a carcass, was <b>after</b> Rabbi Yehoshua’s <b>retraction.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of <b>a kosher</b> animal <b>that suckled</b> milk <b>from a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> the milk in its stomach is prohibited, whereas if a <i>tereifa</i> suckled milk from a kosher animal, the milk in its stomach is permitted. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But doesn’t the first clause</b> of the mishna <b>teach:</b> The congealed milk in <b>the stomach</b> of the animal <b>of a gentile and of a carcass is prohibited?</b> What is the difference between the milk found in the stomach of a <i>tereifa</i> in the second clause and the milk found in the stomach of an unslaughtered carcass in the first clause?
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> In fact, milk found in the stomach of a carcass is not itself prohibited. <b>The first clause</b> of the mishna prohibits it only because one who partakes of it <b>looks like one who eats carcasses,</b> which is repulsive. By contrast, <b>here,</b> with regard to a <i>tereifa</i>, the consumption of milk found in its stomach is less repulsive, as here <b>there is</b> at least <b>slaughter</b> of the animal.
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>But is it not</b> possible to claim <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that milk found in the stomach of a <i>tereifa</i> should be prohibited? <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a carcass, which is</b> so <b>repulsive that</b> even <b>if you permit</b> the milk in <b>its stomach</b> people <b>will not come to partake of</b> the meat, <b>you</b> nevertheless <b>said</b> the milk is <b>not</b> permitted for consumption, is it <b>not all the more so</b> with regard to <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> that has been <b>slaughtered,</b> which is not as repulsive, <b>such that if you permit</b> the milk in its stomach people might <b>come to partake of it?</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This question is <b>not difficult.</b> The first clause of the mishna <b>here,</b> which teaches that the milk in the stomach of a carcass is prohibited, was taught <b>before</b> Rabbi Yehoshua’s <b>retraction</b> cited above, whereas the latter clause <b>there,</b> that milk from the stomach of a <i>tereifa</i> is permitted, was taught <b>after</b> Rabbi Yehoshua’s <b>retraction.</b> A mishna can sometimes preserve an older ruling and then immediately teach a contradictory later ruling, because <b>a mishna does not move from its place.</b> Since the first clause of the mishna was already canonized, it was not removed, despite Rabbi Yehoshua’s change of opinion.
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One may curdle</b> milk <b>with</b> rennet extracted from <b>the stomach of carcasses, but one may not curdle</b> milk <b>with</b> rennet from <b>the stomach of</b> animals <b>slaughtered by a gentile. Rabbi Shimon bar Abba said before</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this ruling? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who said: A gentile’s presumed intention</b> during slaughter <b>is for idol worship.</b> Therefore, the prohibition against deriving benefit from an animal slaughtered in idol worship applies to it, and this prohibition includes the contents of its stomach that are not actually part of its body. By contrast, a carcass is prohibited only for consumption, and the prohibition does not extend to the contents of its stomach.
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon bar Abba: <b>Rather, in accordance with whose</b> opinion could this ruling be? Of course it is the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.
The Gemara relates: <b>When Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One may curdle</b> milk <b>both with</b> rennet from <b>the stomach of a carcass and with</b> rennet from <b>the stomach of</b> an animal <b>slaughtered by a gentile, as</b> there is <b>no</b> need <b>to be concerned for the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b> According to this account, Rabbi Yoḥanan does not maintain that a gentile’s presumed intention is for idol worship.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is: <b>One may not curdle</b> milk <b>with the skin of the stomach of a carcass, but one may curdle</b> milk <b>with</b> rennet from <b>the stomach of a carcass and with</b> rennet from <b>the stomach of</b> an animal <b>slaughtered by a gentile, and with</b> rennet from <b>the stomach of a kosher</b> animal <b>that suckled from a <i>tereifa</i>, and all the more so with</b> rennet from <b>the stomach of a <i>tereifa</i></b> animal <b>that suckled from a kosher</b> animal. <b>What is the reason</b> for these lenient rulings? <b>The milk collected in</b> a stomach <b>is merely secretion</b> and is not considered food that can be prohibited.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Although animal fats and blood are similar in that they are both prohibited by Torah law and punishable by <i>karet</i>, there are elements more <b>stringent in</b> the prohibition of <b>fat than in</b> that of <b>blood, and</b> likewise there are elements more <b>stringent in</b> the prohibition of <b>blood than in</b> that of <b>fat.</b> The elements more <b>stringent in</b> the prohibition of <b>fat are</b> the following: The first is <b>that</b> with regard to <b>fat</b> of an offering,

Daf 117a

one who derives benefit <b>from it</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. <b>And</b> second, one is <b>liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> if it was from an offering that was slaughtered with the intent to sprinkle its blood or partake of it beyond its designated time, <b>and</b> due to the prohibition of <b><i>notar</i>,</b> if it was from an offering whose period for consumption has expired. <b>And</b> third, if one is ritually impure, he is liable due to the prohibition of partaking of it while <b>impure. This is not so with regard to blood,</b> as one is not liable in these cases for violating the prohibitions of <i>piggul</i>, <i>notar</i>, and partaking of offerings while impure, but rather is liable only for violating the prohibition of consuming blood.
<b>And</b> the more <b>stringent</b> element <b>in</b> the prohibition of <b>blood</b> is <b>that</b> the prohibition of <b>blood applies to domesticated animals, undomesticated animals, and birds, both kosher and non-kosher, but</b> the prohibition of forbidden <b>fat applies only to a kosher domesticated animal.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> According to the mishna, one who consumes forbidden fat of an offering is liable for misuse of consecrated property. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yannai said:</b> They are derived from a verse, <b>as the verse states</b> that the sacrificial portions of a bull brought for an unwitting sin of the anointed priest must be burned upon the altar: <b>“As it is taken off from the bull of the peace offering”</b> (Leviticus 4:10). <b>But what, then, do we learn from the bull of the peace offering?</b> Everything that is specified with regard to a peace offering is stated with regard to this bull as well (see Leviticus 4:8–9).
Rather, <b>this</b> phrase initially <b>comes to teach</b> a <i>halakha</i> about the bull brought as an offering for an unwitting sin of the anointed priest, <b>but it turns out</b> that <b>it</b> actually <b>derives</b> a <i>halakha</i> from that case, as the verse <b>juxtaposes the bull of the peace offering to the bull of the anointed priest.</b> It teaches that <b>just as the bull of the anointed priest,</b> as an offering of the most sacred order, <b>is subject to</b> the prohibition on <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, as offerings of the most sacred order are called “the sacred items of the Lord” (see Leviticus 5:15), <b>so too</b> the sacrificial portions of <b>the bull of the peace offering,</b> including its forbidden fat, are <b>subject to misuse</b> of consecrated property, even though it is an offering of lesser sanctity and is considered the property of the owner before slaughter.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said to</b> Rabbi Yannai: <b>Is that</b> derivation <b>that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught unattractive,</b> that you derive a new one? He taught that when the Torah states with regard to peace offerings, which are of lesser sanctity: <b>“All the fat is the Lord’s”</b> (Leviticus 3:16), it serves <b>to include the sacrificial portions of offerings of lesser sanctity in</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, even though the prohibition is stated explicitly only with regard to offerings of the most sacred order.
<b>Abaye said:</b> Rabbi Yannai’s derivation <b>was necessary, as, if the Merciful One had written</b> only the verse “All <b>the fat</b> is the Lord’s,” <b>I would say</b> that the <b>fat</b> of offerings of lesser sanctity, <b>yes,</b> they are included in the prohibition, but the <b>diaphragm and</b> the <b>two kidneys</b> of such offerings are <b>not,</b> even though they are also burned upon the altar. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “As it is taken off</b> from the bull of the peace offering,” to teach that even these portions are subject to the prohibition of misuse.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> only the phrase: <b>“As it is taken off</b> from the bull,” <b>I would say</b> that the prohibition applies only to those portions that are found in a bull, and that <b>the fat of</b> a sheep <b>tail, which is not</b> found <b>in a bull,</b> is <b>not</b> included. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “All the fat</b> is the Lord’s,” to teach that the prohibition of misuse applies to all portions of offerings of lesser sanctity, including a sheep tail, which is referred to as fat in Leviticus 3:9.
<b>Rav Mari said to Rav Zevid: If</b> a sheep <b>tail is called “fat,” it should be prohibited for consumption,</b> like forbidden fat. Rav Zevid <b>said to</b> Rav Mari: <b>With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states:</b> “You shall eat no <b>fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat”</b> (Leviticus 7:23). This teaches that the Torah designates as forbidden fat only <b>an item that is</b> found <b>equally in an ox, and a sheep, and a goat.</b> Since the ox and goat do not have a tail that consists of a large amount of fat, the sheep’s fatty tail is not prohibited.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> a different explanation: <b>It is called “the fat tail,”</b> but <b>it is not called</b> simply: <b>Fat, without specification.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so</b> that the addition of a modifier indicates that the tail is not truly fat, then one who derives benefit <b>from</b> the tail <b>should not be</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property either. <b>Rather, it is clear</b> that the correct answer is <b>as</b> stated <b>by Rav Zevid.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>This is not so with regard to blood,</b> as one who derives benefit from blood is not liable for misuse of consecrated property. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Ulla said: The verse states</b> with regard to blood: “For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it <b>to you</b> upon the altar to make atonement for your souls” (Leviticus 17:11). The term “to you” indicates that <b>it shall be yours,</b> rather than consecrated property, and is therefore not subject to the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property. <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a different derivation. By using the term <b>“to make atonement,”</b> the verse teaches that God is saying: <b>I gave it to</b> achieve <b>atonement, but</b> not to be subject <b>to</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived from the latter part of <b>the verse,</b> which <b>states:</b> “For <b>it is</b> the blood that makes atonement for the soul” (Leviticus 17:11). The term “it is” teaches that the status of the blood remains as it is, i.e., <b>it is before atonement as</b> it is <b>after atonement.</b> As the Gemara will state, there is a principle that once the mitzva involving a consecrated item has been performed, the item is no longer subject to the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property. Accordingly, the term “it is” teaches that <b>just as after atonement,</b> i.e., after the blood has been sprinkled upon the altar, it is <b>not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, as the mitzva has already been performed, <b>so too, before atonement,</b> i.e., before the blood has been sprinkled upon the altar, it is <b>not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> if the term “it is” teaches that the status of the blood remains the same before and after atonement, one can <b>say</b> just the opposite: <b>It is after atonement as</b> it is <b>before atonement. Just as before atonement</b> the blood <b>is subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>so too, after atonement it is subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. The Gemara responds: This cannot be the case, since as a rule, <b>there is no item whose mitzva has been performed and</b> is still subject to the prohibition of <b>misusing</b> of consecrated property.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there <b>no</b> such case? <b>But there is</b> the mitzva of the daily <b>removal of the ashes</b> of offerings burned on the altar, <b>the mitzva of which has been performed, and</b> yet one who derives benefit <b>from it</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>as it is written:</b> “And he shall take up the ashes of what the fire has consumed of the burnt offering on the altar, <b>and he shall put them beside the altar”</b> (Leviticus 6:3). The ashes must be left there, where they are absorbed into the ground, and one who removes and derives benefit from them violates the prohibition against misuse of consecrated property, even though their mitzva has been performed. This contradicts the principle posited above.
The Gemara answers: The principle does not apply in that case, <b>because</b> the mitzva of <b>the removal of the ashes and the</b> matter of the four white <b>priestly vestments</b> worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, which may not be used again, are both specified as exceptions to the <i>halakha</i> that the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property does not apply after their mitzva has been performed. Consequently, they <b>are two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., they share a unique <i>halakha</i> not found elsewhere. <b>And</b> as a rule, <b>any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common element to apply to other cases. The principle therefore remains in place.
The Gemara raises a further difficulty: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that the verse: “And he shall take off the linen garments, which he wore when he went into the Sanctuary, <b>and shall leave them there”</b> (Leviticus 16:23), <b>teaches that</b> these four white garments worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur are not fit for further use, and <b>they require interment. But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa, who said</b> that the verse teaches only <b>that</b> the High Priest <b>may not use</b> the vestments <b>on Yom Kippur</b> in <b>a different</b> year, but they are fit for an ordinary priest and do not require interment, <b>what is there to say?</b> If the priestly vestments are not an exception to the <i>halakha</i> that there is no prohibition of misuse of consecrated property after the performance of a mitzva, the removal of the ashes remains as the only exception. Why, then, does it not serve as a paradigm for other instances in the Torah?
The Gemara responds: <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because</b> the cases of the <b>removal of the ashes and the heifer whose neck is broken</b> to atone for an unsolved murder (Deuteronomy 21:1–9) <b>are two verses that come as one,</b> as it is also prohibited to derive benefit from the heifer after its mitzva is performed. <b>And any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common element to apply to other cases.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that two verses that come as one <b>do not teach</b> their common element to apply to other cases, <b>but according to the one who says</b> that two verses that come as one do <b>teach</b> their common element to apply to other cases, <b>what is there to say?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Two</b>

Daf 117b

<b>exclusions are written</b> in these two cases, which indicate that this <i>halakha</i> applies to them alone. <b>Here,</b> with regard to the removal of ashes, <b>it is written: “And he shall put it”</b> (Leviticus 6:3), indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies to “it,” and nothing else. <b>There,</b> with regard to the heifer whose neck is broken, <b>it is written: “Whose neck was broken”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:6). This superfluous description teaches that the <i>halakha</i> that the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property is in effect even after the performance of a mitzva applies solely to this case and should not be extended to others.
The Gemara returns to the three phrases from Leviticus 17:11 cited above as teaching that the blood of offerings is not subject to the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property: <b>And why do I</b> need all <b>three verses</b> stated <b>with regard to blood?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> term serves <b>to exclude</b> blood <b>from</b> the prohibition of <b><i>notar</i>.</b> If one consumed the blood of such an offering, he is not liable for consuming <i>notar</i> as one who consumed the flesh would be. Rather, he is liable for violating only the prohibition against consuming blood. <b>And one</b> term serves <b>to exclude</b> blood <b>from</b> the prohibition against <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>and one</b> other term serves <b>to exclude</b> it <b>from</b> the prohibition of consumption of offerings in a state of <b>ritual impurity.</b> If one consumed this blood in a state of ritual impurity, he is liable only for consuming blood, but not for consuming consecrated food while ritually impure.
<b>But no verse is required</b> to exclude this blood <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> an offering sacrificed with intention to consume it beyond its designated time, consumption of which is punishable by <i>karet</i>, as this exception is already derived from another source. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Zevaḥim</i> 43a): Concerning <b>any</b> item <b>that has permitting factors, either with regard to</b> consumption by <b>a person or with regard to</b> burning on <b>the altar, one is liable for</b> eating <b>it due to</b> violation of the prohibition of <b><i>piggul</i>. But</b> the permitting factor itself is not subject to <i>piggul</i>, and the <b>blood</b> of an offering <b>is itself a permitting factor,</b> as consumption of the offering by a person or by the altar is only permitted after the blood has been sprinkled on the altar. Therefore, the blood is not subject to the prohibition of <i>piggul</i>.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> All foods that became ritually impure through contact with a source of impurity transmit impurity to other food and liquids only if the impure foods measure an egg-bulk. In that regard, the Sages ruled that even if a piece of meat itself is less than an egg-bulk, <b>the</b> attached <b>hide,</b> even if it is not fit for consumption, joins together with the meat to constitute an egg-bulk. <b>And</b> the same is true of <b>the</b> congealed <b>gravy</b> attached to the meat, although it is not eaten; <b>and</b> likewise <b>the spices</b> added to flavor the meat, although they are not eaten; <b>and the meat residue</b> attached to the hide after flaying; <b>and the bones; and the tendons; and</b> the lower section of <b>the horns,</b> which remains attached to the flesh when the rest of the horn is removed; <b>and</b> the upper section of <b>the hooves,</b> which remains attached to the flesh when the rest of the hoof is removed.
All these items <b>join together</b> with the meat to constitute the requisite egg-bulk <b>to impart the impurity of food.</b> Although if any of them was an egg-bulk they would not impart impurity of food, when attached to the meat they complete the measure. <b>But</b> they do <b>not</b> join together to constitute the measure of an olive-bulk required to impart <b>the impurity of animal carcasses.</b>
<b>Similarly,</b> there is another item that imparts impurity of food but not impurity of animal carcasses: In the case of <b>one who slaughters a non-kosher animal for a gentile and</b> the animal <b>is</b> still <b>twitching</b> and comes into contact with a source of impurity, the animal becomes impure with impurity of food and <b>imparts impurity of food</b> to other food, <b>but</b> does <b>not</b> impart <b>impurity of animal carcasses until</b> it <b>dies, or until one severs its head.</b> The mishna summarizes: The Torah <b>included</b> certain items <b>to impart impurity of food beyond those which it included to impart impurity of animal carcasses.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>the meat residue</b> attached to the hide after flaying <b>that</b> was <b>collected, if there is an olive-bulk of it in one place</b> it imparts impurity of an animal carcass, and one who contracts impurity from it and then eats consecrated foods or enters the Temple is <b>liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i>. By collecting it in one place, the person indicates that he considers it as meat.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the attached hide joins together with the meat to constitute the requisite egg-bulk to impart the impurity of food even though it is not fit for consumption. This is because the hide acts as a protective cover for the meat. But it does not join to constitute the measure of an olive-bulk required to impart the impurity of animal carcasses. The Gemara notes: <b>We learn</b> in the mishna <b>that which the Sages taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i>: An appendage that serves as <b>protection</b> joins together with food <b>with regard to a light</b> level of <b>impurity,</b> such as the impurity of food, which can be transmitted only to food but not to people or vessels. <b>But protection</b> attached to food does <b>not</b> join together with food <b>with regard to a severe</b> level of <b>impurity,</b> such as the impurity of an animal carcass, which can be transmitted even to people and vessels.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>protection</b> joins together with food <b>with regard to a light</b> level of <b>impurity?</b> The Gemara answers that it is derived from a verse, <b>as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of imparting impurity of food, the verse states: “And if anything falls from their carcass <b>upon any sowing seed</b> that is sown, it is pure. But if water is put upon the seed, and any of the carcass falls on it, it is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:37–38). The phrase “upon any sowing seed” indicates that the entire seed is susceptible to impurity when it is in a state where it is <b>typical for people to take it out</b> to the field <b>for sowing:</b> This applies to <b>wheat in its shell, and barley in its shell, and lentils in their shells.</b> This demonstrates that shells and other components that protect the food are considered part of the food with regard to a light level of impurity.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>protection does not</b> join together with the food <b>with regard to a severe</b> level of <b>impurity?</b> The Gemara answers that it is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the impurity of a carcass, the verse states: “And if any animal of which you may eat dies, one who touches <b>its carcass</b> shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). This indicates that only one who touches the flesh of the carcass becomes impure, <b>but</b> one who touches the <b>hide</b> of the carcass <b>upon which there is not an olive-bulk of flesh</b> does <b>not</b> become impure.

Daf 118a

One <b>might</b> have thought that only one who touches the flesh of the carcass becomes impure, but <b>one who touches the external</b> side of the hide of the carcass that is <b>aligned with the flesh,</b> but does not touch the flesh itself, <b>does not become impure.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “One who touches its carcass <b>shall be impure</b> until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). It is derived from the term “shall be impure” that even one who touches the hide in this manner becomes impure.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>saying?</b> The first clause of the <i>baraita</i> teaches that the hide does not impart impurity of a carcass while the latter clause teaches that one who touches the hide does become impure with the impurity of a carcass. <b>Rava said, and some say it unattributed:</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> The term <b>“its carcass”</b> teaches that one who touches the flesh of a carcass becomes impure <b>but</b> one who touches the <b>hide</b> of a carcass <b>upon which there is not an olive-bulk of flesh</b> does <b>not</b> become impure. <b>And</b> even if the volume of the <b>hide</b> together with the flesh <b>adds up to an olive-bulk,</b> the hide does not join together with the flesh to constitute the measure of an olive-bulk required to impart impurity of an animal carcass.
One <b>might</b> have thought <b>that I remove</b> from the category of impurity of a carcass <b>even a hide upon which there is an olive-bulk of flesh</b> with regard to <b>one who touches the external</b> side of the hide of the carcass that is <b>aligned with the flesh</b> but does not touch the flesh itself. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he does not become impure</b> in such a case, <b>and</b> that the hide in this case <b>does not even constitute a handle</b> of the flesh, which would render one who touches it impure as though he touched the flesh itself.
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Shall be impure,”</b> from which it is derived that even though an appendage that serves as protection for the flesh does not join together with the flesh to constitute the measure of an olive-bulk required to impart the impurity of animal carcasses, it is considered a handle of the flesh, which does impart impurity. Therefore, if there is an olive-bulk of flesh attached to the hide, one who touches the outside of the hide becomes impure, even if he did not touch the flesh.
§The Gemara discusses the transmission of impurity of food with regard to accessories that serve as a handle and that provide protection. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Okatzin</i> 1:1): With regard to <b>any</b> appendage <b>that</b> serves as <b>a handle,</b> i.e., a part that one holds while eating the food, <b>but</b> does <b>not</b> provide <b>protection,</b> the attached food becomes <b>impure</b> if the handle comes into contact with a source of impurity, <b>and</b> the handle <b>transmits impurity</b> from the attached food to other foods that come into contact with the handle. <b>But</b> the handle <b>does not join together</b> with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity.
With regard to any appendage that provides <b>protection, even if</b> it does <b>not</b> serve as <b>a handle,</b> the attached food becomes <b>impure</b> if the protection comes into contact with an impure item, <b>and</b> the protection <b>imparts impurity, and it</b> also <b>joins together</b> with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. With regard to an appendage that does <b>not</b> serve as <b>a handle nor</b> as <b>protection,</b> the attached food does <b>not</b> become <b>impure</b> if the appendage comes into contact with a source of impurity, <b>nor</b> does the appendage <b>impart impurity.</b> In addition, it does not join together with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity.
The Gemara asks: <b>Where</b> is this <i>halakha</i> that <b>handles</b> are susceptible to and impart impurity <b>written?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to the impurity of food: <b>“But if water is put on the seed, and any of the carcass falls on it, it is impure for you”</b> (Leviticus 11:38). It is derived from the term <b>“for you”</b> that <b>any</b> part <b>needed for your</b> use of the food is susceptible to impurity and imparts impurity, <b>including the handles</b> that facilitate the consumption of the food.
<b>And</b> furthermore <b>it is written</b> with regard to the impurity of a carcass: <b>“And if any animal which is for you</b> to consume <b>dies,</b> one who touches its carcass shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The term <b>“for you”</b> indicates that <b>any</b> part <b>needed for your</b> use of the carcass imparts impurity, <b>including the handles.</b> One who touches the handle of an item that is impure with impurity of a carcass becomes impure as though he touched the carcass itself. These two verses teach that <b>a handle</b> transmits impurity both <b>with regard to importing</b> impurity into the attached food <b>and with regard to exporting</b> impurity from the attached food.
<b>A verse is not needed</b> to derive that <b>protection</b> both <b>imports and exports</b> impurity. This <i>halakha</i> <b>is inferred <i>a fortiori</i> from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a handle: If a handle, which</b> is treated more leniently than protection because it <b>does not protect</b> the food, nevertheless both <b>imports and exports</b> impurity, then with regard to <b>protection,</b> which is treated more stringently than a handle because it protects the food, should it <b>not all the more so</b> import and export impurity?
Since this is so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse <b>that the Merciful One writes</b> from which it is derived that <b>protection</b> is considered part of the food with regard to ritual impurity, i.e., the verses: “Upon any sowing seed that is sown…It is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:37–38)? <b>Conclude from</b> these verses that protection not only imparts impurity, but even <b>joins together</b> with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But say</b> that these verses should be interpreted differently: <b>A handle,</b> which is treated more leniently than protection, is considered part of the food such that it <b>imports but does not export</b> impurity. <b>Protection,</b> which is treated more stringently than a handle, is considered like food <b>to import and export</b> impurity. <b>But</b> it is <b>not</b> derived that <b>a handle exports</b> impurity nor that <b>protection joins together</b> with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity.
The Gemara explains: <b>You cannot say</b> that <b>a handle</b> is considered part of the food such that it <b>imports but does not export</b> impurity for the following reason: <b>Now</b> that the handle is considered part of the food with regard to <b>importing</b> impurity into the food, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that it <b>exports</b> impurity? If a handle can cause ritually pure food attached to it to become impure, certainly it can transmit the impurity of impure food attached to it to other foods. Consequently, since a handle both imports and exports impurity, it is inferred <i>a fortiori</i> that protection also imports and exports impurity. It is therefore derived from the verse concerning appendages that serve as protection that protection joins together with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But say</b> instead that <b>a handle,</b> which is treated more leniently than protection, is considered part of the food such that it <b>exports but does not import</b> impurity. <b>Protection,</b> which is treated more stringently than a handle, both <b>exports and imports</b> impurity. <b>But</b> it is <b>not</b> derived that <b>a handle imports</b> impurity <b>nor</b> that <b>protection joins together</b> with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity.
The Gemara explains: There is <b>an additional</b> derivation with regard to <b>a handle,</b> as <b>it is written</b> with regard to the impurity of vessels: “And everything upon which any part of their carcass falls shall be impure; whether <b>an oven, or a range for pots, it shall be broken</b> in pieces; they are impure, and shall be impure for you” (Leviticus 11:35).
It is derived from the term <b>“for you”</b> that <b>any</b> part <b>needed for your</b> use of a vessel has the impurity status of the vessel itself, <b>including the handles.</b> Therefore, if the vessel comes into contact with a source of impurity, the handle is considered part of the vessel and is also rendered impure. Consequently, there are two derivations with regard to a handle: One teaches that a handle imports impurity into the object to which it is attached, and the other teaches that a handle exports impurity from the object. It is derived through <i>a fortiori</i> inference from the <i>halakha</i> of a handle that protection both imports and exports impurity, and therefore the verse that states “Upon any sowing seed” teaches that protection joins together with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity.
The Gemara asks: With regard to these three verses that are interpreted as referring to handles, one of which discusses the impurity of food, one of which discusses the impurity of vessels, and one of which discusses the impurity of carcasses, <b>which of them is superfluous</b> such that one can derive from it that a handle does not merely export impurity from the food but imports impurity to the food as well? All of these verses are necessary to teach that a handle exports impurity.
The Gemara elaborates on the question: <b>Let the Merciful One write</b> that a handle exports impurity <b>with regard to</b> the impurity of <b>seeds,</b> i.e., food, <b>and let those</b> matters, i.e., that it exports the impurity of vessels and animal carcasses, <b>be derived from it.</b> But one cannot infer from the impurity of food that a handle exports the impurity of vessels, as <b>what</b> is notable <b>about seeds?</b> It is notable <b>in that they have a greater</b> susceptibility to <b>impurity.</b> Food is susceptible to even second-degree impurity, whereas vessels are susceptible to only first-degree impurity. Likewise, one cannot derive from the impurity of food that a handle exports the impurity of an animal carcass because the impurity of food applies to more items, as is taught in the mishna that some items are susceptible to the impurity of food but not to the impurity of animal carcasses.
<b>Let the Merciful One write</b> that a handle exports impurity <b>with regard to</b> the impurity of <b>an oven,</b> i.e., vessels, <b>and let those</b> matters, i.e., that it exports the impurity of food and the impurity of an animal carcass, <b>be derived from it.</b> But this inference is also not valid, as <b>what</b> is notable <b>about</b> the impurity of <b>an oven?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> a vessel <b>transmits impurity</b> to foods not only through contact but also <b>through its airspace,</b> whereas those other types of impurity do not share this element of stringency.
<b>Let the Merciful One write</b> that a handle exports impurity <b>with regard to</b> the impurity of an animal <b>carcass, and let those</b> matters, i.e., that it exports the impurity of food and of vessels, <b>be derived from it.</b> But this inference is also not valid, as <b>what</b> is notable <b>about</b> the impurity of <b>a carcass?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> a carcass <b>transmits impurity to a person, and transmits impurity to</b> one <b>carrying</b> the carcass even if he is not touching it, <b>and</b> its <b>impurity emanates from its body</b> and does not originate from an external source. Those other types of impurity do not share these elements of stringency.
The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>one</b> of these three types of ritual impurity <b>cannot be derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of any <b>one</b> of the others. Yet, one of the verses is still superfluous because one can <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one</b> of these three types <b>from</b> the other <b>two.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> can one <b>derive</b> from the other two? <b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> that a handle exports impurity <b>with regard to</b> the impurity of <b>seeds,</b> i.e., food, <b>and derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from those</b> two other cases, the impurity of carcasses and of vessels. But this inference is not valid, as <b>what</b> is notable <b>about those</b> cases? They are notable <b>in that they become ritually impure without</b> first being <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity by coming into contact with liquid. <b>Shall you say</b> the same <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to seeds, which</b> do not share this element of stringency, as food <b>can become impure only</b> after first being <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity by coming into contact with liquid?
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> This element of leniency is not unique to the impurity of food. <b>Produce that is not rendered susceptible</b> to impurity by coming into contact with liquid <b>is equivalent to an oven whose construction is not complete.</b> An oven whose construction is incomplete is also not susceptible to impurity.
<b>Rather, refute</b> this derivation <b>in the following manner: What</b> is notable <b>about those</b> cases of impurity of carcasses and vessels? They are notable <b>in that they become impure</b> even <b>without contact.</b> An oven becomes impure if a creeping animal is within its airspace, and the impurity of an animal carcass originates from its own body without contact with an external source. <b>Shall you state</b> the same <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to seeds, which become impure only through contact?</b>
<b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> that a handle exports impurity <b>with regard to</b> the impurity of <b>an oven,</b> i.e., vessels, <b>and derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from those</b> cases, the impurity of food and carcasses. But this derivation is not valid, as <b>what</b> is notable <b>about those</b> cases of the impurity of food and carcasses? They are notable <b>in that they are food.</b> Therefore, their <i>halakhot</i> cannot necessarily be applied to an oven and other vessels that are not food.
<b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> that a handle exports impurity <b>with regard to a carcass and derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from those</b> cases of the impurity of food and vessels. The Gemara responds: <b>Yes, it is indeed so. Rather,</b> since one can derive in such a manner that a handle attached to a carcass imparts impurity, <b>why do I</b> need the verse to state the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a handle</b> with regard to the impurity <b>of a carcass? If it is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of a handle</b> with regard to the impurity of <b>a carcass, apply it</b> to the <b>matter of a handle in general</b> with regard to food, and derive from it that a handle imports impurity to the food.
Therefore, in summary, one can derive that <b>a handle imports</b> impurity and that <b>a handle exports</b> impurity, and one can infer that protection imports and exports impurity <i>a fortiori</i> from the <i>halakha</i> of a handle. It is therefore derived from the verse concerning protection that <b>protection joins together</b> with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But it is still necessary</b> for the verse to state the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a handle</b> exports impurity with regard to the impurity <b>of a carcass; as, if the Merciful One had not written</b> the <i>halakha</i> of a handle <b>with regard to</b> impurity of <b>a carcass, I would say: It is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source.</b> In this case, a <i>halakha</i> with regard to the impurity of carcasses which is inferred <i>a fortiori</i> from the cases of impurity of food and impurity of vessels is no more stringent than the source from which it is derived. <b>Just as</b> handles in <b>these</b> cases of impurity of food and vessels <b>do not transmit impurity to a person, so too</b> the handle of <b>a carcass does not transmit impurity to a person.</b> Therefore, the verse from which it is derived that a handle exports the impurity of a carcass <b>is</b> necessary, and cannot be applied to the matter of importing impurity.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, it is necessary</b> for the verse to state the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a handle</b> with regard to the impurity <b>of a carcass, but it is not necessary</b> for the verse to state the <i>halakha</i> of <b>protection</b> with regard to the impurity <b>of a carcass. With regard to what <i>halakha</i> does the Merciful One write</b> that verse? <b>If</b> it is teaching that protection <b>joins together</b> with the carcass to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity, <b>you said</b> that protection <b>does not join together</b> with the carcass to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. <b>And</b> if it is teaching that protection <b>exports</b> the impurity of a carcass, it is not necessary to teach that, because that <i>halakha</i> <b>is inferred <i>a fortiori</i> from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a handle.</b>
<b>Rather, if it is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of protection of a carcass, apply it</b> to the <b>matter of the handle of a carcass. And if it is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of a handle of a carcass, apply it</b> to the <b>matter of a handle in general,</b> and derive from it that a handle imports impurity. Therefore, in summary, one can derive that <b>a handle exports</b> impurity and that <b>a handle imports</b> impurity, <b>and</b> one can derive from the verse concerning protection with regard to the impurity of food that <b>protection joins together</b> with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity.

Daf 118b

The Gemara asks: Why is it assumed that if the verse is not needed for the matter of protection of a carcass, it should be applied to the matter of a handle in general? <b>Say</b> that <b>if</b> the verse <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of protection of a carcass, apply it</b> to the <b>matter of protection in general</b> with regard to food. Although it is already written: “Upon any sowing seed” (Leviticus 11:37), two verses are necessary to teach the <i>halakha</i> of protection with regard to food: One verse to teach that <b>protection imports</b> impurity <b>and</b> one to teach that <b>protection joins together</b> with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. <b>But</b> there is <b>no</b> source from which to derive that <b>a handle imports</b> impurity.
The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> that a handle imports impurity is not derived from the superfluous verse written with regard to the impurity of a carcass. <b>Rather,</b> it is necessary to return to the explanation that was initially proposed, i.e., that it is written with regard to the impurity of food: “It is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:38), from which it is derived that any part needed for your use of the food imparts impurity, including handles. It was asked with regard to this derivation: Say that this verse teaches that a handle exports impurity but not that it imports impurity. The Gemara suggests: That question is not difficult. <b>From the outset, when</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a handle is written:</b> “But if water is put upon the seed, and any of their carcass falls on it, it is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:38), <b>it is written</b> in the context <b>of importing</b> impurity. Therefore, it is inferred <i>a fortiori</i> that a handle exports impurity from the <i>halakha</i> that it imports impurity, and it is derived <i>a fortiori</i> from the <i>halakhot</i> of a handle that protection both imports and exports impurity. It is also derived that protection joins together with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity from that which is written: “On any sowing seed.”
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse to teach the <i>halakha</i> of <b>protection with regard to a carcass,</b> as it is written: “Shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:39)? The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>for the matter itself,</b> to teach that the <i>halakha</i> of protection is applicable to the impurity of a carcass.
The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to what</b> <i>halakha</i> is this taught? <b>If</b> it teaches that protection <b>joins together</b> with the carcass to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity, <b>you said</b> in the mishna that protection <b>does not join together</b> with the carcass to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. <b>If</b> it teaches that protection <b>imports and exports</b> the impurity of a carcass, it is not necessary for the verse to teach this <i>halakha</i> because <b>it is inferred <i>a fortiori</i> from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a handle.</b> The Gemara answers: Sometimes there is <b>a matter that</b> could be <b>inferred <i>a fortiori</i>,</b> and <b>the verse</b> nevertheless <b>takes the trouble and writes it</b> explicitly.
The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> one may ask: With regard to <b>protection in general,</b> i.e., with regard to food, it was established that the verse is not necessary to teach that it imports and exports impurity, and therefore the verse teaches that protection joins together with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. <b>I will say to you</b> instead that the verse teaches that protection <b>imports</b> impurity, <b>and</b> the reason that the verse teaches this <i>halakha</i> even though it could be inferred <i>a fortiori</i> is because sometimes there is <b>a matter that</b> could <b>be inferred <i>a fortiori</i></b> and <b>the verse</b> nevertheless <b>takes the trouble and writes it</b> explicitly.
The Gemara answers: <b>Where it is</b> possible <b>to interpret</b> the verse in a manner that a novelty is derived, <b>we interpret</b> it in such a manner and do not maintain that the verse teaches that which could be inferred <i>a fortiori</i>.
The Gemara returns to the previous proposal to derive that a handle imports impurity from the verse concerning protection of a carcass based on the reasoning that if the verse is not needed for the matter of protection of a carcass, it should be applied to the matter of a handle in general. Previously, the Gemara challenged this derivation: If the verse is not needed for the matter of protection for the impurity of a carcass, it should be applied to the matter of protection in general. <b>Rav Ḥaviva said</b> in response: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>protection of a carcass is different</b> because it imports and exports impurity but does not join together with the carcass to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. <b>Since</b> the protection <b>serves as a handle</b> in that it only imports and exports impurity, <b>we apply its</b> novelty <b>to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a handle</b> and not to the <i>halakhot</i> of protection.
§Previously it was derived that protection joins together with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity from that which is written: “On any sowing seed that is sown” (Leviticus 11:37), indicating that the entire seed is susceptible to ritual impurity when it is in a state where it is typical for people to take it out to the field for sowing, e.g., wheat and barley in their shells. <b>Rav Yehuda bar Yishmael objects to this</b> from <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 2:3): <b>The protrusion of a pomegranate joins together</b> with the pomegranate to constitute the measure of an egg-bulk that is required to impart impurity, because it provides protection for the fruit. <b>But its flower does not join together</b> with the pomegranate in that regard because it does not provide protection for the fruit; rather, it provides protection for the protection of the fruit.
Rav Yehuda bar Yishmael asks: <b>And why</b> does the protrusion join together with the pomegranate to constitute an egg-bulk? <b>Read here</b> that the verse states: <b>“On any sowing seed,”</b> indicating that the entire seed is susceptible to ritual impurity when it is in a state where it is typically taken out to the field for sowing. <b>But</b> pomegranates <b>are not</b> typically taken out to the field for sowing with their protrusions, since they are usually planted in the field as seedlings.
<b>And furthermore,</b> one can object to this derivation from <b>that which we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>The hide and the</b> congealed <b>gravy</b> attached to the meat, <b>and the spices,</b> and the meat residue, and the bones, and the tendons, and the lower section of the horns, and the section of the hooves, all <b>join together</b> with the meat to constitute the requisite egg-bulk <b>to impart impurity of food. From where do we</b> derive that these protections, although they are not sown together with the food, join together with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity?
<b>Rather, three terms</b> with the root <i>zayin</i>, <i>reish</i>, <i>ayin</i> <b>are written</b> in the verse with regard to protection: <b>“On any sowing [<i>zerua</i>] seed [<i>zera</i>] that is sown [<i>yizzare’a</i>].” One</b> term is written <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> of <b>protection with regard to seeds, and one</b> is written <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> of <b>protection with regard to trees,</b> and <b>the other</b> term is written <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> of <b>protection with regard to meat, and eggs, and fish.</b> Accordingly, this <i>halakha</i> is not limited to protection that is sown together with the food.
§It is written: “And if anything falls from their carcass upon any sowing seed that is sown, it is pure. But if water is put upon the seed, and any of the carcass falls on it, it is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:37–38). Previously, the Gemara derived from this verse that an appendage that serves as a handle both imports impurity to and exports impurity from the food. In addition, the simple understanding teaches that food can become impure only after first being rendered susceptible to impurity by coming into contact with liquid. With regard to these two <i>halakhot</i>, <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi says</b> that <b>Rav says: There is</b> significance to <b>a handle with regard to</b> importing and exporting <b>impurity,</b> i.e., a handle imports impurity to and exports impurity from to the attached food, <b>but there is no</b> significance to <b>a handle with regard to rendering</b> the attached food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity. Rather, the food itself must come into contact with liquid directly.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: There is</b> significance to <b>a handle with regard to</b> importing impurity to and exporting <b>impurity</b> from the attached food, <b>and with regard to rendering</b> the attached food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity even if only the handle came into contact with liquid.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>With regard to what do</b> Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagree? If you wish, say</b> that they disagree with regard to <b>a logical argument. If you wish, say</b> that they disagree with regard to the interpretation of <b>a verse.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>If you wish, say</b> that they disagree with regard to the interpretation of <b>a verse.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that <b>a verse is interpreted homiletically</b> based on juxtaposition to the term immediately <b>preceding it and not</b> based on juxtaposition to the term <b>before the one preceding it.</b> In this case, the verse states: “For you,” indicating inclusion of a handle with regard to the matter of imparting impurity, which is stated in the preceding phrase: “It is impure,” but not with regard to the matter of rendering the attached food susceptible to impurity through contact with liquid which is stated before the preceding phrase: “If water is put.”
<b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>a verse is interpreted homiletically</b> based on juxtaposition to the term immediately <b>preceding it, as well as</b> to the term <b>before the one preceding it.</b> Therefore, he maintains that a handle can also render the attached food susceptible to impurity.
<b>If you wish, say</b> that they disagree with regard to <b>a logical argument.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that <b>rendering</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity <b>is the initial stage of</b> the process of imparting <b>impurity</b> to it. Therefore, just as a handle imparts impurity, it can also render the food susceptible to impurity. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that <b>rendering</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity <b>is not the initial stage of</b> the process of imparting <b>impurity.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Just as there is</b> significance to <b>a handle with regard to</b> imparting <b>impurity</b> to food, <b>so too there is</b> significance to <b>a handle with regard to rendering</b> the attached food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity. <b>And just as</b> produce is susceptible to <b>contracting impurity only when it is detached</b> from the soil, <b>so too</b> produce <b>cannot be rendered susceptible</b> to impurity through contact with liquid <b>until it is detached</b> from the soil.
§The Gemara cites another disagreement between Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>Rav says: There is no</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b>a handle</b> with regard to imparting impurity <b>for</b> a handle that is attached to <b>less than an olive-bulk</b> of food. <b>And there is no</b> <i>halakha</i> of <b>protection</b> with regard to imparting impurity <b>for</b> protection that is attached to <b>less than a bean-bulk</b> of food. In addition, the protection does not join together with the food to constitute the measure of an egg-bulk required to impart the impurity of food.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: There is</b> a <i>halakha</i> of <b>a handle</b> with regard to imparting impurity <b>for</b> a handle that is attached to <b>less than an olive-bulk</b> of food. <b>And there is</b> a <i>halakha</i> of <b>protection</b> with regard to imparting impurity <b>for</b> protection that is attached to <b>less than a bean-bulk</b> of food. In addition, it joins together with the food to constitute the measure of an egg-bulk required to impart the impurity of food.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinions of both Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan from that which is taught in a <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Oholot</i> 4:8): In a case of <b>two bones</b> that have <b>two halves of an olive-</b>bulk of flesh of a dead person <b>upon them,</b> i.e., half an olive-bulk of flesh is attached to one end of each bone, <b>and one placed the ends of both</b> bones that are not directly attached to the flesh <b>inside a house</b> in such a manner that <b>the house overlies those</b> ends of the bones but not the ends of the bones attached to the flesh, it is considered as though the house is overlying the flesh itself, and <b>the house is impure.</b>
<b>Yehuda ben Nekosa says in the name of Rabbi Ya’akov: How can two bones join together to</b> constitute <b>an olive-bulk</b> if the flesh attached to each bone is less than the measure of an olive-bulk?

Daf 119a

The Gemara explains the objection: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rav,</b> who holds that a handle that is attached to less than an olive-bulk of food or protection that is attached to less than a bean-bulk of food is not considered a handle or protection with regard to imparting impurity, <b>in what</b> manner <b>does he interpret this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is discussing the case of a bone without marrow, and therefore the bone constitutes merely <b>a handle</b> for the flesh, which measures less than an olive-bulk, then <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is difficult,</b> because it indicates that a handle that is attached to less than an olive-bulk of food is considered a handle with regard to imparting impurity.
<b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is discussing the case of a bone containing marrow, and therefore the bone constitutes <b>protection</b> for food measuring less than an olive-bulk, then <b>the last clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is difficult</b> because Yehuda ben Nekosa apparently holds that protection that is attached to less than an olive-bulk of food is not considered protection with regard to imparting impurity, contrary to the opinion of Rav, who holds that it is protection unless it is attached to less than a bean-bulk of food.
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that Rav interprets the <i>baraita</i> as discussing the case of a bone that constitutes <b>protection. If you wish, say</b> instead that Rav interprets the <i>baraita</i> as discussing the case of a bone that constitutes <b>a handle.</b>
The Gemara explains its answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is discussing the case of a bone that constitutes <b>a handle, and</b> Rav <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Nekosa,</b> who maintains that the house does not become impure because he holds that a handle that is attached to less than an olive-bulk of flesh does not impart impurity. <b>And If you wish, say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is discussing the case of a bone that constitutes <b>protection, and</b> Rav <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who maintains that the house is impure because he holds that protection attached to less than an olive-bulk of flesh imparts impurity if the flesh measures at least a bean-bulk.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said</b> that <b>the entire</b> <i>baraita</i> is discussing the case of a bone that constitutes <b>a handle, and</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who maintains that the house becomes impure because he holds that a handle that is attached to less than an olive-bulk of food imparts impurity. But he did not state his opinion in accordance with the opinion of Yehuda ben Nekosa, who maintains that the house does not become impure.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another objection to the opinions of Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan from the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Okatzin</i> 2:5): <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>a femur that has an olive-bulk of flesh upon it,</b> the flesh <b>draws the entire</b> femur <b>into ritual impurity</b> if any part of the femur comes into contact with a dead creeping animal. The Sage referred to as <b>Aḥerim says: Even</b> if <b>there is only a bean-bulk</b> of flesh <b>upon</b> the femur, <b>it draws the entire</b> femur <b>into impurity.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>In what</b> manner <b>does Rav interpret this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is discussing the case of a femur that constitutes merely <b>a handle</b> for the flesh, then <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is difficult,</b> because Aḥerim apparently maintains that a handle that is attached to less than an olive-bulk of flesh imparts impurity, contrary to the opinion of Rav. <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is discussing the case of a femur that constitutes <b>protection,</b> then <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is difficult,</b> because Rabbi Yehuda apparently holds that protection that is attached to less than an olive-bulk of flesh does not impart impurity, contrary to the opinion of Rav.
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is discussing the case of a femur that constitutes <b>a handle, and</b> Rav <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who maintains that a handle attached to less than an olive-bulk of flesh does not impart impurity. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the <i>baraita</i> is discussing the case of a femur that constitutes <b>protection, and</b> Rav <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion introduced with the words: <b>Aḥerim</b> says, according to which even protection attached to less than an olive-bulk of flesh imparts impurity.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said</b> that <b>the entire</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to case of a femur that constitutes <b>protection, and</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion referred to as: <b>Aḥerim</b> says, according to which even protection that is attached to a bean-bulk of flesh imparts impurity.
The Gemara asks: How is Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion consistent with the opinion referred to as: <b>Aḥerim</b> says? <b>Don’t</b> they <b>say</b> that protection that is attached to <b>a bean-bulk</b> of flesh imparts impurity, and Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that even protection that is attached to less than a bean-bulk of food imparts impurity?
The Gemara answers: Aḥerim agrees that even protection that is attached to less than a bean-bulk imparts impurity. Nevertheless, <b>since the first <i>tanna</i> states</b> the specific <b>measure</b> of an olive-bulk, Aḥerim <b>also states</b> the specific <b>measure</b> of a bean-bulk even though he maintains his opinion with regard to a measure of less than a bean-bulk as well.
<b>Rava said:</b> The language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise,</b> indicating <b>that we are dealing with protection</b> and not a handle, <b>as it teaches</b> the case of <b>a femur,</b> which contains marrow, and therefore the bone provides protection for the food inside. If the <i>baraita</i> were discussing a handle, it would have taught this <i>halakha</i> with regard to any other bone that is attached to flesh and not specifically a femur. <b>Conclude from it</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is discussing the <i>halakha</i> of protection.
§The <i>baraita</i> cited above teaches that Aḥerim says: Even if there is only a bean-bulk of flesh attached to the femur it causes the entire femur to become impure. A dispute <b>was stated</b> with regard to this opinion. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> When Aḥerim stated the measure of a bean-bulk, <b>this is</b> a specific <b>measure,</b> and Aḥerim holds that the <i>halakha</i> of protection applies to an appendage only if a bean-bulk of food is attached to it. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is not</b> a specific <b>measure.</b> Aḥerim holds that the <i>halakha</i> of protection applies even if it is attached to less than a bean-bulk of food.
The Gemara asks: How is it possible for Rabbi Yoḥanan to hold that <b>this is not</b> a specific <b>measure? But doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> explicitly <b>teach</b> the measure of <b>a bean-bulk?</b> The Gemara answers: Indeed, Aḥerim holds that protection that is attached to even less than a bean-bulk of food imparts impurity. But <b>since the first <i>tanna</i> states</b> the specific <b>measure</b> of an olive-bulk, Aḥerim <b>also states</b> the specific <b>measure</b> of a bean-bulk even though he maintains his opinion with regard to a measure of less than a bean-bulk as well.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof against the opinion of Rav from that which is taught in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 1:5): <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya deems</b> a pod containing <b>beans</b> that came in contact with a dead creeping animal <b>ritually pure.</b> Since beans are large and do not require the protection of the pod, the pod is not considered protection for the beans and therefore does not impart impurity. <b>But he deems</b> a pod containing smaller <b>legumes</b> that came in contact with a dead creeping animal <b>ritually impure</b> if even only one grain is attached to the pod, <b>because one desires</b> the use of the pod <b>when handling</b> the legumes so that he will not damage them, and it is therefore considered protection, which imparts impurity. Apparently, Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya holds that even protection that is attached to less than a bean-bulk of food imparts impurity, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina and Rav.
The Gemara rejects this proof: The explanation of that mishna is <b>in accordance with that which Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said</b> in the context of a different discussion: That mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> a dead creeping animal came into contact with <b>the stalk</b> to which the pod is attached, but not with the pod itself. <b>And</b> therefore the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna is not with regard to the matter of protection; rather, it is <b>with regard to</b> the matter of <b>a handle,</b> as the stalk serves as a handle for the pod and its attached grain.
<b>Here, too,</b> with regard to this proof one can respond that the mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> a dead creeping animal came in contact with <b>the stalk and</b> therefore the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna is <b>with regard to</b> the matter of <b>a handle.</b> Since the mishna is referring to a stalk, and the stalk has many pods on it, it serves as a handle to more than an olive-bulk of food, and is consistent with the opinions of Rabbi Ḥanina and Rav. <b>And what</b> does Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya mean when he says that in the case of legumes, the stalk is impure because one desires the use of the stalk <b>when handling [<i>bemashmishan</i>]</b> the legumes? He is referring <b>to using [<i>betashmishan</i>],</b> i.e., carrying, the legumes with the stalk.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from that <b>which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> With regard to the impurity of food the verse states: <b>“On any sowing seed that is sown”</b> (Leviticus 11:37), indicating that the entire seed is susceptible to impurity when it is in a state where it is <b>typical for people to take it out</b> to the field for sowing: This applies to <b>wheat in its shell, and barley in its shell, and lentils in their shells.</b> It is derived from here that shells and other appendages that protect the food are considered part of the food. Since wheat, barley, and lentil grains are smaller than a bean-bulk, this statement indicates that even protection that is attached to less than a bean-bulk of food imparts impurity, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina and Rav.
The Gemara rejects this proof: A grain is a distinct <b>entity,</b> and therefore its status <b>is different.</b> The <i>halakha</i> of protection is applicable to a distinct entity even if it measures less than a bean-bulk.
§<b>Rav Oshaya raises a dilemma:</b>

Daf 119b

As the Gemara stated, protection joins together with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>two protections joining together</b> with the food to constitute the measure of an egg-bulk required to impart impurity?
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the dilemma? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring to a case <b>where</b> a food item has two layers of protection, and <b>this</b> outer protection <b>is on top of that</b> inner protection, <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i> of protection applicable with regard to <b>protection</b> that is <b>on top of</b> another <b>protection?</b>
<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 2:4) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> There are <b>three peels</b> surrounding <b>an onion.</b> The <b>inner</b> peel is considered like the food itself, and therefore, <b>whether whole or punctured, it joins together</b> with the onion to constitute the requisite measure to impart the impurity of food. With regard to the <b>middle</b> peel, when it is <b>whole</b> it provides protection and therefore <b>joins together</b> with the onion, but when it is <b>punctured</b> it does not provide protection and therefore <b>does not join together</b> with the onion. The <b>outer</b> peel does not join together with the onion at all, and <b>both</b> in <b>this</b> case, when it is whole, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, when it is punctured, it remains <b>ritually pure.</b> Evidently, the <i>halakha</i> of protection is not applied to a protection that surrounds another protection.
The Gemara explains the dilemma: <b>Rav Oshaya</b> does not raise the dilemma with regard to a food item that has two layers of protection. Rather, he <b>raises the dilemma</b> with regard to <b>protection of food that one divided</b> such that the food is whole but the protection is divided into separate sections.
The dilemma is as follows: <b>Since this</b> section of the protection is protecting this part of the food but <b>does not provide protection for that</b> other part of the food, <b>and that</b> other section of the protection is protecting another part of the food but <b>does not provide protection for this</b> part of the food, must one conclude that the two protections <b>do not join together</b> to constitute the requisite measure for the impurity of food?
<b>Or perhaps,</b> should one reason that <b>since this</b> section of the protection <b>provides protection for its</b> part of the food, <b>and that</b> section of the protection <b>provides protection for its</b> part of the food, and the two parts of the food are joined together, therefore the entire entity is considered unified and the two sections of the protection <b>join together</b> to constitute the requisite measure?
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from that which is taught in a mishna cited previously (<i>Okatzin</i> 1:5): <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya deems</b> a pod containing <b>beans</b> that came in contact with a dead creeping animal <b>ritually pure. But he deems</b> a pod containing <b>legumes</b> that came in contact with a dead creeping animal <b>impure because one desires</b> the use of the pod <b>when handling</b> the legumes so that he will not damage them. Since the requisite volume for a food item to be susceptible to impurity is an egg-bulk, and the volume of one pod and its legumes is less than an egg-bulk, this statement must be discussing multiple pods joined together. Evidently, protection of food that is divided into separate sections joins together to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said</b> in rejection of this resolution: That mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> a creeping animal touched <b>the stalk</b> to which the pods are attached but not the pods themselves. <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> in that mishna is not referring to the matter of protection; rather, it is <b>with regard to</b> the matter of <b>a handle,</b> as the stalk serves as a handle for the pod and its attached grain. <b>And what</b> does Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya mean when he says that in the case of legumes, the stalk is impure because one desires the use of the stalk <b>when handling [<i>bemashmishan</i>]</b> the legumes? He is referring <b>to using [<i>betashmishan</i>],</b> i.e., carrying, the legumes with the stalk.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that <b>which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> With regard to the impurity of food the verse states: <b>“On any sowing seed that is sown”</b> (Leviticus 11:37), indicating that the entire seed is susceptible to ritual impurity when it is in a state where it is <b>typical for people to take it out</b> to the field <b>for sowing:</b> This applies to <b>wheat in its shell, and barley in its shell, and lentils in their shells.</b> It is derived from here that shells and other appendages that protect the food join together with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. Since the measure of one grain and its shell is less than an egg-bulk, this statement must be discussing multiple grains and their shells joined together. Evidently, protection of food that is divided into separate sections joins together to impart impurity.
The Gemara rejects this resolution: One can explain this statement <b>in accordance with</b> that <b>which Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said</b> with regard to the statement of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya that was cited previously: The mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> a creeping animal came in contact with <b>the stalk</b> to which the pods are attached but not the pods themselves. <b>And</b> therefore, the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna is not referring to the matter of protection; rather, it is <b>with regard to</b> the matter of <b>a handle.</b>
<b>Here too,</b> the statement of the school of Rabbi Yishmael is not referring to independent grains of wheat and barley, but rather <b>to the stem</b> to which the grains are attached, <b>and</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the status of all the shells of the grains on one stem as <b>protection.</b> All of the grains surrounding the stem protect each other, since if one shell with its grain falls it causes all of the other shells and their grains to fall as well. Therefore, this case is not similar to Rav Oshaya’s dilemma, where each protection protects only part of the food.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the grains located <b>higher</b> on the stem <b>need</b> the grains located <b>lower</b> on the stem to remain in place in order to not fall. <b>But</b> for <b>what</b> purpose do the grains located <b>lower</b> on the stem <b>need</b> the grains located <b>higher</b> on the stem? The Gemara answers: The case is one where the grains are all positioned tightly around the stem <b>in one row</b> in such a manner that if even one located higher up on the stem were to fall, the remaining grains would fall too.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is there</b> a volume of <b>an egg-bulk of food in one row</b> of grain? The Gemara answers: Yes, this <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to</b> large grains of <b>wheat,</b> such as those grown in the time <b>of Shimon ben Shataḥ.</b>
The Gemara points out: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> conclusion, it is not necessary to interpret the <i>baraita</i> as referring to many grains tightly packed around the stem. It is <b>even</b> possible to explain that the <i>baraita</i> is discussing the case of <b>one</b> grain of <b>wheat,</b> such as the large grains of <b>wheat</b> grown in the time <b>of Shimon ben Shataḥ.</b>
§The Gemara proceeds to discuss the <i>Tosefta</i> <b>itself</b> that was cited earlier (118b): In a case of <b>two bones upon which there are two halves of an olive-bulk</b> of flesh of a corpse, i.e., half an olive-bulk of flesh is attached to one end of each bone, <b>and one placed the ends of both</b> bones that are not directly attached to the flesh <b>inside the house</b> in such a manner that <b>the house overlies those</b> ends of the bones but not the ends of the bones attached to the flesh, it is considered as though the house is overlying the flesh itself and <b>the house is impure.</b>
<b>Yehuda ben Nekosa says in the name of Rabbi Ya’akov: How can two bones join together to</b> constitute <b>an olive-bulk</b> if the flesh attached to each bone is less than the measure of an olive-bulk? It may be inferred from here that according to all, if the end of a bone that is attached to an olive-bulk of flesh is outside the house, and the other end that is not directly attached to any flesh is inside the house, the house becomes impure with the ritual impurity of a corpse.
With regard to this matter <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a bone, as it constitutes a handle</b> vis-à-vis the flesh, <b>but</b> if one <b>hair</b> of a corpse is attached to an olive-bulk of flesh at one end, and the other end of the hair is inside a house, it does not render the house impure, because the hair <b>does not constitute a handle</b> vis-à-vis the flesh. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even a hair constitutes a handle</b> vis-à-vis the flesh, and therefore the house is rendered impure.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from the mishna taught later (124a): In the case of the <b>hide</b> of an unslaughtered animal carcass <b>upon which there is an olive-bulk of flesh, one who touches a strand</b> of flesh <b>emerging from</b> the flesh, <b>or</b> touches <b>a hair that is</b> on the side of the hide <b>opposite</b> the flesh, <b>is ritually impure</b> with the impurity of an unslaughtered carcass, even though he did not touch an olive-bulk of the flesh. <b>What</b> is the reason that one who touches the strand of flesh or the hair becomes impure? <b>Is it not because</b> they constitute <b>a handle</b> for the flesh, contrary to the opinion of Reish Lakish with regard to a hair?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the ruling of that mishna is not because the hair serves as a handle for the flesh. Rather, it is <b>because</b> the hair serves as <b>protection</b> for the flesh. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the hide protects the flesh, and the hair is on top of the hide; <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i> of protection applicable with regard to <b>protection</b> that is <b>on top of</b> another <b>protection?</b> The Gemara answers: The hair <b>penetrates through</b> the hide and touches the flesh, thereby providing protection directly for the flesh.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov objects to this</b> answer: <b>If that is so,</b> that there are perforations in the hide through which the hairs penetrate, <b>how can we write phylacteries? Don’t we require</b> phylacteries to be written with <b>a perfect writing,</b> with no perforations in the letters? <b>And</b> that <b>is not</b> possible if there are perforations in the hide.
The Gemara answers: Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <b>overlooked that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>which they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>Any perforation over which the ink passes</b> and which it covers <b>is not</b> considered <b>a perforation</b> that invalidates the writing.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead a different answer to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s objection to Reish Lakish: <b>The entire</b> mishna teaches that one who touches either a strand of flesh or a hair becomes impure <b>because</b> these appendages serve the flesh as <b>a handle</b> and not as protection. Nevertheless, that statement does not contradict the opinion of Reish Lakish that a hair does not constitute a handle for the flesh, because one can explain this mishna <b>as Rabbi Ela stated</b> with regard to a different mishna: It is stated <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>an awn among</b> many <b>awns.</b>
<b>So too,</b> the mishna taught later is stated <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a hair among</b> many <b>hairs</b> and not the case of a single hair. Therefore, the hair constitutes a handle for the flesh because one can hold the hair and lift the flesh without the hair becoming detached.
<b>And where was</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ela stated?</b> It was stated <b>with regard to that</b> which is taught in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 1:3): <b>An awn [<i>melai</i>] that is on top of a stalk</b> constitutes a handle for the stalk. Therefore, <b>it can become impure and impart impurity, but it does not join together</b> with the grains to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. It was asked: <b>For what</b> function <b>is an awn fit</b> such that it is considered to be a handle for the stalk? <b>Rabbi Ilai,</b> i.e., Rabbi Ela, <b>said:</b> That mishna is stated <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>an awn among</b> many <b>awns</b> and not the case of a single awn. Therefore, the awns constitute a handle for the stalk because one can hold the awns and lift the stalk without the awns becoming detached from it.
<b>Some say another version</b> of this dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish and the ensuing discussion with regard to the status of hairs vis-à-vis the flesh: Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish agree that a single hair does not constitute a handle vis-à-vis the flesh connected to it, but they disagree with regard to several hairs. Rabbi Yoḥanan raises an objection to Reish Lakish’s opinion that hair is not considered a handle from the mishna taught later, which states that one who touches a hair emerging from the hide of an animal carcass opposite the flesh is impure, indicating that hair constitutes a handle.
Reish Lakish answers that one who touches the hair is impure not because it is considered a handle, but rather because it is considered protection for the flesh. The Gemara adds: <b>So too it is reasonable</b> to explain that the person is impure <b>because</b> hair is considered <b>protection</b> and not because it is considered a handle, <b>as, if it enters your mind</b> that it is <b>because</b> hair is considered <b>a handle, for what</b> function <b>is one hair fit</b> such that it is considered a handle?
The Gemara responds: One can explain that that mishna considers hair to constitute a handle, <b>as Rabbi Ela stated</b> in explanation of a different mishna: It is stated <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>an awn among</b> many <b>awns. Here too,</b> that mishna is stated <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a hair among</b> many <b>hairs</b> and not the case of a single hair.
<b>And where was</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ela stated?</b> It was stated <b>with regard to that which we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>An awn that is on top of a stalk can become impure and impart impurity, but it does not join together</b> with the grains to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. It was asked: <b>For what</b> function <b>is an awn fit</b> such that it is considered to be a handle for the stalk? <b>Rabbi Ilai said:</b> That mishna is stated <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>an awn among</b> many <b>awns.</b>
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who teach</b> another version of this dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish,

Daf 120a

maintaining that the dispute is <b>with regard to</b> that which is taught in <b>the mishna: The</b> attached <b>hide, and the</b> congealed <b>gravy</b> attached to the meat, <b>and the spices,</b> and the meat residue, and the bones, and the tendons, and the horns, and the hooves all <b>join together</b> with the meat to constitute the requisite egg-bulk <b>to impart the impurity of food.</b>
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that <b>only a bone</b> and the other items mentioned in the mishna join together with the meat to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity <b>because</b> they <b>constitute protection</b> for the meat. <b>But a hair</b> does not join together with the meat to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity because it <b>is not protection</b> for the meat. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even a hair is protection</b> for the meat and therefore joins together with the meat to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity.
<b>Reish Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: But</b> the hide protects the flesh, and the hair is on top of the hide. <b>Is</b> the <i>halakha</i> of protection applicable with regard to <b>protection</b> that is <b>on top of</b> another <b>protection?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan answered: The hair <b>penetrates through</b> the hide and touches the flesh, thereby providing protection directly for the flesh.
<b>Rav Aḥa objects to this</b> answer: <b>If that is so,</b> that there are perforations in the hide through which the hairs penetrate, <b>how can we write phylacteries? Don’t we require</b> phylacteries to be written with <b>a perfect writing</b> with no perforations in the letters? <b>And</b> that <b>is not</b> possible if there are perforations in the hide.
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>which they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>escaped</b> Rav Aḥa: <b>Any perforation over which the ink passes</b> and which it covers <b>is not</b> considered <b>a perforation</b> that invalidates the writing.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> opinion from the mishna taught later (124a): In the case of the <b>hide</b> of an animal carcass <b>upon which there is an olive-bulk of flesh, one who touches a strand</b> of flesh <b>emerging from</b> the flesh <b>or</b> touches <b>a hair that is</b> on the side of the hide <b>opposite</b> the flesh <b>is ritually impure,</b> even though he did not touch an olive-bulk of the flesh. <b>What</b> is the reason that one who touches the strand of flesh or the hair becomes impure? <b>Is it not because</b> they constitute <b>protection</b> for the flesh? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>because</b> the hair constitutes <b>a handle</b> for the flesh.
The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> function <b>is one hair fit</b> such that it constitutes a handle? The Gemara answers: One can explain that mishna <b>as Rabbi Ela said</b> in explanation of a different mishna: It is stated <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>an awn among</b> many <b>awns. Here too,</b> the mishna is stated <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a hair among</b> many <b>hairs</b> and not the case of a single hair. The hair serves as a handle for the flesh because one can hold the hair and lift the flesh without the hair becoming detached.
<b>And where was</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ela stated?</b> It <b>was stated with regard to that which we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>An awn that is on</b> top of <b>a stalk can become impure and impart impurity, but it does not join together</b> with the grains to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. It was asked: <b>For what</b> function <b>is an awn fit</b> such that it is considered to be a handle for the stalk? <b>Rabbi Ela said:</b> The mishna is stated <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>an awn among</b> many <b>awns.</b>
§The mishna teaches: <b>The gravy [<i>rotev</i>]</b> joins together with the meat to constitute the requisite egg-bulk to impart the impurity of food, but an egg-bulk of gravy itself is not susceptible to impurity. The Gemara asks: To <b>what</b> is the term <b><i>rotev</i></b> referring? <b>Rava said:</b> The term <i>rotev</i> is referring to <b>the fat</b> that floats on top of a soup of cooked meat.
<b>Abaye said</b> to Rava: That fat <b>itself</b> is eaten and <b>is</b> therefore susceptible to <b>impurity of food. Rather,</b> the term <i>rotev</i> is referring to <b>fat that</b> oozed out of the meat and <b>congealed.</b> That fat is not eaten, but it does join together with the meat to constitute the requisite egg-bulk to impart the impurity of food.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is the mishna referring <b>specifically</b> to <b>congealed</b> fat? <b>Even</b> in a case <b>where the fat did not congeal</b> it joins together with the meat to constitute the requisite egg-bulk to impart the impurity of food, <b>as Reish Lakish said: Brine on a vegetable,</b> even though it is a liquid, <b>combines</b> with the vegetable <b>to</b> constitute <b>a large date-bulk [<i>kakotevet</i>]</b> with regard to rendering one liable for violating the prohibition against eating <b>on Yom Kippur.</b> Similarly, liquid fat should combine with the meat to constitute the requisite volume to impart the impurity of food.
The Gemara answers: Liquids and solids do not join together to constitute the requisite egg-bulk to impart the impurity of food. The reason for the <i>halakha</i> <b>there,</b> with regard to Yom Kippur, <b>is because</b> one is liable even for the consumption of a liquid that is not characterized as food if the <b>mind</b> of the one who consumes it is <b>settled.</b> This is because with regard to the fast of Yom Kippur the Torah is concerned with a person’s affliction, as the verse states: “You shall afflict your souls” (Leviticus 23:27). Therefore, one is liable on Yom Kippur for <b>any</b> eating that <b>settles his mind.</b>
But that is not the case <b>here with regard to</b> impurity. For two substances to join together to impart impurity, <b>a combination</b> between substances that have a common requisite measure for imparting impurity <b>is</b> necessary. Liquid and solid foods do not have the same requisite measure. Therefore, <b>if</b> the fat <b>is congealed, it joins together</b> with the meat. <b>If it is not congealed, it does not join together</b> with the meat.
§The mishna teaches: <b>The spices [<i>kifa</i>]</b> join together with the meat to constitute the requisite egg-bulk to impart the impurity of food, but an egg-bulk of <i>kifa</i> itself is not susceptible to impurity. The Gemara asks: To <b>what</b> is the term <b><i>kifa</i></b> referring? <b>Rabba said:</b> The term <i>kifa</i> is referring to a congealed <b>hash</b> of cooked meat that settled to the bottom of the pot.
<b>Abaye said</b> to Rabba: That hash <b>itself is</b> eaten and is therefore susceptible to <b>the impurity of food. Rather, Rav Pappa said:</b> The term <i>kifa</i> is referring to <b>spices,</b> which are not eaten themselves but do join together with the meat to constitute the requisite egg-bulk to impart the impurity of food.
§Since the mishna mentions <i>kifa</i>, which, according to Rabba, is referring to a congealed substance, the Gemara discusses the <i>halakha</i> of one who congealed a forbidden substance and consumed it. <b>We learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>there:</b> One who <b>caused blood to coagulate and ate it or melted</b> forbidden <b>fat and swallowed it is liable.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>Granted,</b> one who <b>caused blood to coagulate and ate it</b> is liable. Although blood is not normally eaten in such a manner, <b>since he caused</b> the blood <b>to coagulate, he ascribed</b> the <b>significance</b> of food <b>to it,</b> and the Torah prohibits the eating of blood, as it is written: “You shall eat neither fat nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17). <b>But</b> why is one who <b>melted</b> forbidden <b>fat and swallowed it</b> liable? <b>Eating,</b> and not drinking, <b>is stated</b> in the Torah with regard to the prohibition against the consumption of forbidden fat, as it is written: “You shall eat no fat of ox or sheep or goat” (Leviticus 7:23), <b>and this</b> swallowing of a liquid <b>is not eating.</b>
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> One is liable even for drinking the melted forbidden fat of an animal. <b>The verse states:</b> “For all who eat the fat of the animal that one could offer from it a fire offering to the Lord, the soul that eats it shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 7:25). The term <b>“soul”</b> is interpreted homiletically <b>to include</b> in the prohibition <b>one who drinks</b> the fat.
The Gemara comments: A novelty <b>of this kind is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition against eating <b>leavened bread</b> on Passover: If one took bread, <b>dissolved it</b> in water, <b>and swallowed</b> this mixture on Passover, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: <b>If it is leavened bread, he is punished with <i>karet</i>; if it is <i>matza</i>,</b> then <b>a person does not fulfill his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>on Passover with</b> this food.
The Gemara objects: <b>Granted, if it is <i>matza</i>, a person does not fulfill his obligation</b> to eat <i>matza</i> <b>on Passover with</b> this food, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the prohibition against eating leavened bread on Passover: “You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days you shall eat unleavened bread with it, even <b>the bread of affliction”</b> (Deuteronomy 16:3), indicating that one must eat the bread of affliction, <b>but this</b> bread dissolved in water <b>is not</b> considered <b>the bread of affliction. But if</b> the bread <b>is leavened bread,</b> why <b>is he punished with <i>karet</i>? Eating is written with regard to</b> the prohibition against leavened bread, and in this case he did not eat it but rather drank it.
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> One is liable even for drinking leavened bread. <b>The verse states:</b> “For all who eat leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel” (Exodus 12:15). The term <b>“soul”</b> is interpreted homiletically <b>to include</b> in the prohibition <b>one who drinks</b> leavened bread.
The Gemara comments: A novelty <b>of this kind is also taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Zavim</i> 5:9) <b>with regard to</b> one who eats <b>the</b> unslaughtered <b>carcass of a kosher bird: One who liquefied</b> the carcass of an unslaughtered kosher bird <b>in fire</b> and drank the substance <b>is impure.</b> But one who liquefied it <b>in the sun</b> and drank it <b>is pure. And we discussed it: Eating</b> and not drinking <b>is stated</b> with regard to the impurity of a carcass, as it is written: “And every soul that eats an unslaughtered carcass or that which is mauled by an animal, whether he is native or stranger, he shall wash his garments, bathe in water, and shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 17:15). Why, then, does one who drinks a kosher bird carcass become impure?
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> He becomes impure because <b>the verse states:</b> “And every <b>soul.”</b> The term “soul” is interpreted homiletically <b>to include one who drinks.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> one who drinks a carcass that is melted <b>in the sun</b> should <b>also</b> become impure. The Gemara explains: A carcass takes a long time to melt <b>in the sun.</b> Therefore, the liquid <b>becomes rotten</b> and unfit for consumption.
The Gemara cited three instances in which Reish Lakish interpreted the term “soul” as including one who drinks. The Gemara explains: All three mentions of the term “soul” <b>are necessary. As, if the Merciful One had written</b> the term “soul” only with regard to forbidden <b>fat,</b> liability for drinking liquefied <b>leavened bread could not have been derived from it, since</b> the prohibition against the consumption of forbidden fat has an element of stringency that does not apply to leavened bread in that the forbidden fat <b>had no period of fitness</b> for consumption. Leavened bread, on the other hand, may be consumed before Passover. Likewise, impurity contracted by drinking a liquefied <b>carcass could not be derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of forbidden fat <b>because</b> the consumption of forbidden fat is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>,</b> which is not the case with regard to the consumption of a carcass.
<b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> the term “soul” only with regard to <b>leavened bread,</b> liability for drinking melted forbidden <b>fat could not be derived from it, as</b> there are <b>no</b> circumstances in which <b>the general prohibition</b> against eating leavened bread <b>was permitted.</b> The consumption of forbidden fat, on the other hand, is permitted with regard to the fat of an undomesticated animal. <b>And</b> similarly, impurity contracted by drinking a liquefied <b>carcass could not be derived from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of leavened bread, <b>because</b> the <i>halakha</i> of leavened bread has an element of stringency that does not apply to a carcass in that its consumption is <b>punishable by <i>karet</i>.</b>
<b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> the term “soul” only <b>with regard to a carcass, those</b> prohibitions against drinking melted fat and liquefied leavened bread <b>could not be derived from it, because</b> a carcass has an element of stringency that does not apply to those prohibitions in that <b>it transmits impurity</b> to one who eats it. Therefore, all three mentions of the term “soul” are necessary.
The Gemara objects: It is true that <b>one</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>cannot be derived from</b> either <b>one</b> of the others, as detailed above. Nevertheless, one can <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>one</b> of them <b>from</b> the other <b>two.</b> The Gemara responds: This is not possible, as <b>which</b> <i>halakha</i> can one <b>derive</b> from the others? <b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> a liquefied <b>carcass and derive</b> it <b>from these</b> other prohibitions against eating forbidden fat and leavened bread. One can refute this derivation: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about these</b> other prohibitions? They are notable <b>in that</b> one who transgresses them <b>is punished with <i>karet</i>,</b> contrary to one who eats a carcass.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> dissolved <b>leavened bread and derive</b> it <b>from these</b> <i>halakhot</i> of forbidden fat and a carcass. The Gemara refutes the derivation: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about these</b> <i>halakhot</i>? They are notable <b>in that they had no period of fitness</b> for consumption, as opposed to leavened bread, which was fit for consumption before Passover.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let the Merciful One not write</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> forbidden <b>fat and derive</b> it <b>from these</b> <i>halakhot</i> of consuming leavened bread and a carcass. The Gemara refutes the derivation: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about these</b> <i>halakhot</i>? They are notable <b>in that</b> there are <b>no</b> circumstances in which <b>their general prohibition was permitted. Shall you say</b> the same <b>with regard to</b> forbidden <b>fat, whose general prohibition was permitted</b> in certain circumstances? Therefore, all three mentions of the term “soul” are necessary.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is</b> the case in which forbidden fat is permitted? <b>If we say</b> that it is the <b>fat of a domesticated animal</b> that is permitted to be sacrificed in the Temple <b>to the Most High,</b> a bird <b>carcass is also permitted</b> to be sacrificed in the Temple. Although <b>pinching</b> the nape of the neck of <b>a bird</b> renders it an unslaughtered carcass and forbidden for consumption, bird offerings are sacrificed <b>to the Most High</b> in such a manner.
<b>And</b> if the reference is <b>rather</b> to <b>the</b> forbidden <b>fat of an undomesticated animal,</b> which is permitted <b>to an ordinary</b> person, one may respond that <b>a carcass is also permitted</b> for a person’s consumption in a certain case, as <b>the pinching of</b> the nape of the neck of <b>a bird sin offering</b> renders it fit <b>for</b> consumption of <b>the priests.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the reference is to <b>the</b> forbidden <b>fat of an undomesticated animal,</b> which is permitted <b>to an ordinary</b> person. <b>And that which</b> is <b>difficult for you</b> with regard to the fact that the <b>priests</b> eat the carcass of a bird which is brought as a sin offering is not difficult, as the <b>priests receive</b> their portion <b>from the table of the Most High.</b> Since this carcass is permitted as an offering to God, it is permitted to the priests as well. Therefore, this does not qualify as a case of an unslaughtered carcass permitted to ordinary people.
§The Gemara challenges: <b>But that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i> is difficult. The Torah states with regard to the prohibition against eating creeping animals: “These are they <b>that are impure [<i>hatteme’im</i>]</b> to you among all the creeping animals” (Leviticus 11:31). The Sages interpret the letter <i>heh</i> in the term “<i>hatteme’im</i>” <b>to forbid their juice</b> that oozes from their carcasses, <b>and their gravy</b> that is produced when they are cooked, <b>and sediments</b> of <b>their</b> flesh that congeal at the bottom of the dish when cooked. The Gemara explains the challenge: <b>Why do I</b> need a verse to teach this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Let</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>be learned from these</b> <i>halakhot</i> of melted forbidden fat, a liquefied bird carcass, and dissolved leavened bread.
The Gemara answers: <b>It is necessary</b> for this <i>halakha</i> to be written, <b>as if the Merciful One had not written</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to creeping animals and instead the <i>halakha</i> was derived from the other <i>halakhot</i>, <b>I would say: It is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source.</b> Accordingly, <b>just as there,</b> one who consumes melted forbidden fat, a liquefied carcass, or dissolved leavened bread is not liable <b>until</b> he consumes <b>an olive-bulk, so too here,</b> with regard to consuming the juice, gravy, and sediments of creeping animals, one is not liable <b>until</b> he consumes <b>an olive-bulk.</b> Therefore, a separate verse is necessary to teach that one is liable even for consuming a lentil-bulk of the juice, gravy, or sediments of a creeping animal, just as one is liable for consuming this measure of the creeping animal itself.

Daf 120b

The Gemara objects: <b>Let the Merciful One write</b> the prohibition against consuming the juice, gravy, and sediments of <b>creeping animals and let these</b> <i>halakhot</i> of consuming liquefied forbidden fat, dissolved leavened bread, and a melted carcass of a bird <b>come and be learned from</b> it. The Torah does not need to state those <i>halakhot</i> explicitly.
The Gemara explains: It is not possible to derive those <i>halakhot</i> in such a manner <b>because</b> that derivation <b>can be refuted: What</b> is notable <b>about creeping animals?</b> They are notable <b>in that their impurity</b> is imparted <b>in any amount.</b> Those other <i>halakhot</i>, on the other hand, do not apply to less than an olive-bulk.
§The Gemara continues to examine the source for the status of liquids with regard to various <i>halakhot</i> based on <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>untithed produce; and the new crop</b> of grain of the year, which is forbidden until after the <i>omer</i> offering is brought on the sixteenth of Nisan (see Leviticus 23:14); <b>and consecrated</b> produce; <b>and</b> the produce of <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year after the designated time when it must be removed from one’s house; <b>and diverse kinds,</b> i.e., the produce of a vineyard in which grains were sown; with regard to <b>all of them,</b> it is prohibited to consume <b>liquid that emerges from them just as</b> it is prohibited to consume them <b>themselves.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>?
<b>And if you would say: Let</b> those prohibitions <b>be learned from these</b> prohibitions of consuming the liquid that seeps from creeping animals, liquefied fat, dissolved leavened bread, and liquefied bird carcasses, one can respond that this derivation can be refuted. <b>What</b> is notable <b>about these</b> prohibitions? They are notable <b>in that</b> each of them is <b>a prohibition that develops on its own</b> without any human intervention, as opposed to the prohibitions in the <i>baraita</i>, which do not necessarily share this element of stringency.
Therefore, <b>it works out well</b> to derive the prohibition against consuming liquids that emerged from a solid <b>where the prohibition</b> is one that <b>develops on its own,</b> such as untithed produce, the new crop, Sabbatical Year produce and diverse kinds. But with regard to consecrated produce, <b>where the prohibition does not develop on its own</b> but rather only after a person consecrates the produce, <b>from where do we</b> derive that it is prohibited to consume the liquid that emerges from the produce just as it is prohibited to consume the produce itself?
The Gemara answers: <b>We learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the case of <b>first fruits.</b> Consumption of first fruits is a prohibition that does not develop on its own, because the owner must set aside the first fruits. And consumption of the liquid that emerges from first fruits is prohibited like consumption of the fruit itself. The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>first fruits themselves?</b>
The Gemara answers that first fruits can be brought as wine, <b>as Rabbi Yosei teaches:</b> The verse states with regard to first fruits: “You shall take of the first of all the <b>fruit</b> of the ground, which you shall bring in from your land” (Deuteronomy 26:2). Since the verse mentions fruit, this indicates that <b>you must bring</b> actual <b>fruit, and you may not bring</b> the first fruits in the form of <b>beverages.</b> But if one <b>brought grapes and</b> he had already <b>pressed them</b> into wine, <b>from where</b> is it derived that he has fulfilled his obligation? <b>The verse states: “You shall bring in</b> from your land.” This superfluous term serves to teach that if one brings wine for the mitzva of first fruits, he has fulfilled his obligation.
But this derivation from the case of first fruits <b>can be refuted: What</b> is notable <b>about first fruits?</b> They are notable <b>in that they require reciting</b> the passage which begins: “My father was a wandering Aramean” (Deuteronomy 26:5), <b>and placing</b> the fruits in the Temple, whereas no such requirements exists with regard to consecrated produce.
<b>Rather,</b> one can <b>derive</b> the prohibition against consuming the liquid that emerges from consecrated produce <b>from</b> the prohibition against consuming liquid that emerges from <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> i.e., the portion of produce designated for the priest.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i> itself?</b> the Gemara answers: It is derived from the fact <b>that</b> <i>teruma</i> <b>is compared to first fruits, as</b> it is written: “You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your cattle and of your flocks, or any of your vows that you will vow, or your pledges, nor the offering of your hand” (Deuteronomy 12:17), and <b>the Master said</b> with regard to the phrase <b>“nor the offering [<i>teruma</i>] of your hand”</b> that <b>these are</b> the <b>first fruits.</b> Since the verse uses the term “<i>teruma</i>” with regard to first fruits, the <i>halakha</i> of <i>teruma</i> is compared to the <i>halakha</i> of first fruits: Just as liquid that emerges from first fruits is forbidden like the fruit itself, so too liquid that emerges from <i>teruma</i> is forbidden like the produce itself. Consequently, the prohibition against consuming the liquid that emerges from consecrated produce can be derived from <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara refutes this derivation from <i>teruma</i>: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about <i>teruma</i>?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> a non-priest <b>is liable</b> to receive the punishment of <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven <b>for</b> consuming <i>teruma</i>, <b>and</b> he must restore the value of the produce he ate, adding <b>one-fifth</b> of its value as a fine. This element of stringency does not exist with regard to one who consumes consecrated produce.
<b>Rather,</b> one can <b>learn</b> the prohibition against consuming the liquid that emerges from consecrated produce <b>from both <i>teruma</i> and first fruits.</b> The Gemara refutes this derivation: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about <i>teruma</i> and first fruits?</b> They are notable <b>in that</b> a non-priest <b>is liable</b> to receive the punishment of <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven <b>for</b> consuming <i>teruma</i> or first fruits, <b>and</b> he must restore the value of the produce he ate, adding <b>one-fifth</b> of its value as a fine. This is not true with regard to one who consumes consecrated produce.
<b>Rather,</b> the prohibition against consuming the liquid that emerges from consecrated produce <b>is derived from <i>teruma</i> and one of these</b> prohibitions, i.e., a liquefied carcass of a bird or dissolved leavened bread; <b>or</b> it can be derived <b>from first fruits and one of these</b> prohibitions.
§The Gemara elaborates on the comparison between <i>teruma</i> and first fruits with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that the status of liquid that emerges from produce is like that of the produce itself, <b>and</b> it explains <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 11:2): If a non-priest ate <b>date honey, or apple wine, or vinegar</b> made <b>from grapes of autumn</b> that grow stunted at the end of the season and are unfit for wine production, <b>or</b> any of the <b>other types of</b> juice made from <b>fruits of <i>teruma</i>, Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> him <b>obligated</b> to repay <b>the principal and</b> an additional <b>fifth,</b> like the penalty for one who ate the <i>teruma</i> produce itself. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua deems</b> him <b>exempt</b> from payment.
The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what</b> principle do Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua <b>disagree? They disagree with regard to</b> the principles governing the process of deriving one <i>halakha</i> from another <i>halakha</i>. One maintains the exegetical principle: <b>Infer from it, and</b> again <b>from it,</b> i.e., when one case is derived from another all the details of the source case are applied to the other case; <b>and</b> one maintains the principle: <b>Infer from it but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to its</b> own <b>place,</b> i.e., one derives only the basic principle of the source case, whereas all other aspects of the source case are not applied to the case at hand.
<b>As Rabbi Eliezer holds: Infer from it, and</b> again <b>from it. Just as</b> with regard to <b>first fruits,</b> the status of the <b>liquid that emerges from them is like</b> that of the produce itself, <b>so too</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> the status of the <b>liquid that emerges from it is like</b> that of the produce itself. <b>And</b> again infer <b>from it: Just as</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>first fruits</b> includes not only olives and grapes but <b>even other types</b> of produce from the seven species for which Eretz Yisrael is praised, and the status of liquid that emerges from that produce is like that of the produce itself, <b>so too</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> although oil and wine are the only liquids from which one is obligated to separate <i>teruma</i>, <b>even</b> liquid that emerges from <b>other types</b> of produce designated as <i>teruma</i> besides olives and grapes has the same status as the produce itself.
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua holds: Infer from it</b> that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>first fruits</b> the status of the <b>liquid that emerges from them is like</b> that of the produce itself, <b>so too</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> the status of the <b>liquid that emerges from it is like</b> that of the produce itself. <b>But interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to its</b> own <b>place: Just as</b> in the case of <b>liquids that are consecrated as <i>teruma</i>,</b> with regard to <b>wine and oil, yes,</b> they are included, <b>but other</b> types are <b>not</b> included, <b>so too</b> in the case of <b>liquid that emerges from</b> <i>teruma</i>, as with regard to <b>wine and oil, yes,</b> they <b>are like</b> the produce itself, <b>but any other</b> type of liquid that emerges from <i>teruma</i> is <b>not</b> like the produce itself. Therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua deems exempt a non-priest who consumed any of the beverages mentioned in the mishna.
The Gemara cites <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 11:3): <b>One may bring beverages</b> made from <b>first fruits</b> to the Temple <b>only</b> in the case of <b>that which emerges from the olives,</b> i.e., oil, <b>or from the grapes,</b> i.e., wine. The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is that mishna?
The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, who says: Infer from it but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to its</b> own <b>place.</b> He derives the <i>halakha</i> of liquid that emerges from <i>teruma</i> from first fruits only with regard to wine and oil, <b>and</b> in the opposite direction, <b>he derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of</b> liquid that emerges from <b>first fruits from <i>teruma</i>.</b> Therefore, even with regard to first fruits the status of liquid that emerges from the produce is like that of the produce itself only with regard to wine and oil. But according to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, who holds that the <i>halakha</i> of liquid that emerges from <i>teruma</i> is derived from first fruits even with regard to other types of produce besides grapes and olives, contrary to the statement of that mishna, one may bring beverages extracted from other first fruits besides wine and oil to the Temple.
The Gemara cites <b>that which we learned</b> in the same mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 11:3): <b>One incurs the forty</b> lashes <b>due to</b> drinking the juice squeezed from <b><i>orla</i>,</b> i.e., the fruit of a tree during the first three years after its planting, <b>only for that which emerges from the olives or from the grapes.</b> The Gemara asks: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is that mishna?
The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, who says: Infer from it but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to its</b> own <b>place, and he derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of</b> liquid that emerges from <b>first fruits from <i>teruma</i>.</b> Therefore, even with regard to first fruits, the status of liquid that emerges from the produce is like that of the produce itself only with regard to wine and oil.

Daf 121a

<b>And then he derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of</b> liquid that emerges from <b><i>orla</i> from first fruits</b> via a verbal analogy between one instance of the word <b>fruit</b> and another instance of the word <b>fruit.</b> With regard to <i>orla</i> the verse states: “And you shall count the fruit thereof as forbidden” (Leviticus 19:23), and with regard to first fruits the verse states: “And you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground” (Deuteronomy 26:2). Therefore, just as with regard to first fruits the status of liquid that emerges from the produce is like that of the produce only with regard to grapes and olives, so too with regard to <i>orla</i> one receives lashes only for drinking the liquid of grapes and olives, but not for drinking the liquid of other types of produce.
§The mishna teaches that <b>the <i>alal</i></b> joins together with the flesh to constitute the requisite egg-bulk to impart the impurity of food, despite not being considered food itself. The Gemara asks: To <b>what</b> is the term <b><i>alal</i></b> referring? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is referring to <b>the nuchal ligament [<i>marteka</i>]. And Reish Lakish says:</b> It is referring to the <b>meat</b> residue <b>that</b> is attached to the hide after <b>the knife has flayed</b> the flesh.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the explanation of Reish Lakish from that which is written: <b>“But you are plasterers of lies, you are all physicians of no value [<i>elil</i>]”</b> (Job 13:4). The term “no value [<i>elil</i>]” stems from the same linguistic root as the word <i>alal</i>. <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that the word <i>alal</i> is referring to <b>the nuchal ligament,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>that is</b> why Job accused his companions of giving advice without merit by making an analogy to a physician who attempts to heal the nuchal ligament, <b>which cannot be healed. But according to the one who says</b> that the word <i>alal</i> is referring to the <b>meat</b> residue <b>that</b> is attached to the hide after <b>the knife has flayed</b> the flesh, i.e., Reish Lakish, flesh that is hanging from the hide <b>is able to be healed.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to</b> the term <b><i>elil</i> in the verse, everyone agrees</b> that it is referring to the nuchal ligament. <b>When</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish <b>disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the definition of the term <b><i>alal</i></b> employed by the Sages <b>in the mishna.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that which is taught in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>the <i>alal</i> that</b> was <b>collected, if there is an olive-bulk</b> of it <b>in one place</b> it imparts the impurity of animal carcasses. Therefore, one who eats it or touches it and then eats consecrated food or enters the Temple <b>is liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for it. And Rav Huna said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> applicable only <b>when</b> a halakhically competent person <b>collected</b> the <i>alal</i> in one place, but not if the <i>alal</i> was collected by a child or without human intervention. By collecting it in one place, the person indicates that he considers it to be food.
<b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that the word <i>alal</i> is referring to the <b>meat</b> residue <b>that</b> is attached to the hide after <b>the knife has flayed</b> the flesh, i.e., Reish Lakish, <b>that is</b> why Rabbi Yehuda says <b>that one is rendered liable when there is an olive-bulk</b> of <i>alal</i> collected in one place, because the person who collected it considers it to be food. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the word <i>alal</i> is referring to <b>the nuchal ligament,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, even in a case <b>when there is an olive-bulk</b> of <i>alal</i> collected in one place, <b>what of it? It is merely wood,</b> i.e., it is unfit for consumption.
The Gemara answers: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish <b>do not disagree;</b> they agree that the term <i>alal</i> is referring to the meat residue attached to the hide after the knife has flayed the flesh. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is with regard to the definition of the word alal according to the opinion of the Rabbis. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The Rabbis maintain that the nuchal ligament also joins together with the meat to constitute the requisite measure of an egg-bulk to impart the impurity of food. And Reish Lakish says: The Rabbis maintain that <b>specifically</b> the <b>meat</b> residue <b>that</b> is attached to the hide after <b>the knife has flayed</b> the meat joins together with the flesh, <b>but the nuchal ligament does not join together.</b>
<b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>that</b> which is taught in the mishna, that the <b>meat</b> residue <b>that</b> is attached to the hide after <b>the knife flayed</b> the flesh joins together with the meat to constitute the measure of an egg-bulk required to impart the impurity of food? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where one intends</b> to eat this meat residue, then it <b>can become impure</b> not only by joining together with the meat, but <b>even by itself,</b> like any other food. <b>And if</b> it is a case <b>where one does not intend</b> to eat this meat residue, why should it be susceptible to impurity at all? One has completely <b>nullified</b> its status as food.
<b>Rabbi Avin and Rabbi Meyasha</b> answered this dilemma. <b>One said:</b> It is a case where <b>one intends</b> to eat <b>part of</b> the meat residue, but it is uncertain which part. Therefore, the meat residue is not susceptible to impurity by itself because it is not entirely considered to be food, but the part that he intends to eat joins together with the meat to constitute the measure of an egg-bulk.
<b>And one said:</b> It is a case where one does not intend to eat any part of the meat residue. Rather, <b>an animal severed part of</b> the meat residue attached to the hide, and therefore that part of the meat residue retains its status as food. <b>And</b> the <b>knife severed part of</b> the meat residue, and one therefore nullified its status as food with regard to that part. Since it is uncertain which part was severed by a knife and which part by an animal, the meat residue itself is not susceptible to impurity, but the part that was severed by an animal joins together with the meat to constitute the measure of an egg-bulk.
§The mishna stated that the horns join together with the flesh to constitute the requisite egg-bulk to impart the impurity of food. The Gemara comments that <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Teharot</i> 1:2): <b>The beak and the talons</b> of a bird that come into contact with a creeping animal can <b>become impure, and transmit impurity</b> to food, <b>and join together</b> with the attached flesh to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity. The Gemara asks: Why does <b>a beak</b> join together with the flesh to impart impurity? <b>It is merely wood,</b> i.e., it is unfit for consumption.
<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The mishna is stated <b>with regard to the lower</b> half of the <b>beak,</b> i.e., the lower mandible. The Gemara objects: <b>The lower</b> mandible <b>is also merely wood. Rav Pappa says:</b> The mishna is discussing <b>the lower</b> section <b>of the upper</b> mandible and is referring to the membrane inside the mouth that is attached to the beak.
Similarly, with regard to the <b>talons</b> mentioned in that mishna, <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> That mishna is not discussing the talons themselves, but rather <b>the place</b> at the base of the talon <b>that is subsumed within the flesh.</b>
Similarly, with regard to the <b>horns</b> mentioned in the mishna, <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The mishna is not discussing the hard substance of the horn, but rather is referring <b>to the place</b> at the base of the horns <b>where one severs</b> the horns <b>and blood flows from them.</b>
§The mishna teaches: <b>Similarly,</b> in the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> a non-kosher <b>animal</b> for a gentile and the animal is still twitching and comes into contact with a source of impurity, it imparts impurity of food, but does not impart impurity of an animal carcass.
<b>Rabbi Asi says:</b> Some Sages <b>teach</b> that when <b>a Jew</b> slaughters <b>a non-kosher</b> animal <b>or a gentile</b> slaughters <b>a kosher</b> animal, in order for it to be susceptible to impurity of food, it is <b>necessary</b> that the <b>intention</b> of the one performing the slaughter be that the flesh be designated as food while it is still twitching. <b>And</b> furthermore, in order for the animal to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity, it requires contact with <b>water</b> or another liquid that renders food susceptible to impurity that comes <b>from another place.</b> The blood of this slaughter is not considered a liquid that renders food susceptible to impurity because it flowed from a valid slaughter.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the animal to come in contact with liquid in order for it to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity of food? The flesh of the animal <b>will eventually become impure</b> with a more <b>severe</b> level of <b>impurity</b> when it dies, i.e., impurity of an animal carcass. <b>And any</b> food <b>that will eventually become impure</b> with a more <b>severe</b> level of <b>impurity does not require</b> contact with liquid to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity of food.
The Gemara now explains the source of this principle. <b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael teaches:</b> With regard to rendering food susceptible to impurity through contact with liquid, the verse states: <b>“But if water is put upon the seed,</b> and any of the carcass falls on it, it is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:38). <b>Just as seeds, which will never contract</b> a more <b>severe</b> level of <b>impurity,</b> because no form of severe impurity applies to foods other than meat, <b>require</b> contact with liquid to <b>render</b> them <b>susceptible</b> to their less severe level of impurity, <b>so too any</b> food <b>that will never contract</b> a more <b>severe</b> level of <b>impurity requires</b> contact with liquid to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity of food. By contrast, any food that will become impure with a more severe level of impurity does not require contact with liquid to be rendered susceptible to impurity of food.
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that in order for <b>the carcass of a kosher bird</b> to become susceptible to impurity it <b>requires</b> that the <b>intention</b> of the one performing the slaughter be to designate the animal as food, <b>but it is not required</b> for the bird to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity through contact with liquid? The reason is <b>because</b>

Daf 121b

<b>eventually</b> the carcass of the bird <b>will impart</b> a more <b>severe impurity</b> when it is in the throat of the person who consumes it. Therefore, it is not necessary for the carcass of a kosher bird to come in contact with liquid in order for it to be susceptible to impurity.
<b>Ḥizkiyya says</b> in response: The reason for the opinion of the Sages stated by Rabbi Asi is <b>since</b> the slaughterer <b>is able to chop</b> the animal into small pieces <b>and</b> thereby <b>establish</b> the volume of every piece of the animal <b>as less than an olive-bulk.</b> In such a scenario, the animal would not be susceptible to impurity. Therefore, it is not certain that the animal will eventually become impure with a more severe impurity.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Zeira: And did Ḥizkiyya</b> actually <b>say such</b> a statement? <b>But wasn’t it stated:</b> If one <b>slaughtered</b> a non-kosher animal in a valid manner by cutting the <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i>, i.e., the windpipe and the gullet, <b>or the majority of</b> the <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i>, <b>and</b> the animal <b>is still twitching, Ḥizkiyya says: There is no</b> prohibition against eating the <b>limbs</b> from such a twitching animal. Therefore, a gentile, who is prohibited from consuming a limb from a living animal, may consume this animal. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: There is</b> a prohibition against eating the <b>limbs</b> of such an animal.
The Gemara explains the opinions: <b>Ḥizkiyya says</b> that <b>there is no</b> prohibition against eating the <b>limbs</b> of such an animal, as since it was slaughtered in a valid manner <b>it is</b> considered <b>dead. Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>there is</b> a prohibition against eating the <b>limbs</b> of such an animal, as since it is twitching <b>it is not</b> yet <b>dead.</b> Therefore, since Ḥizkiyya maintains that a twitching animal is considered dead, it should have the impurity of a carcass, contrary to the opinion of the Sages cited by Rabbi Asi, as well as the mishna.
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya in response: Ḥizkiyya maintains that such an animal has <b>left the category of a living</b> animal, <b>but has not entered the category of a dead</b> animal. Therefore, it is not prohibited for a gentile to consume such an animal, but the animal does not have the impurity of a carcass.
§The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> of the dispute between Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yoḥanan: If one <b>slaughtered</b> a non-kosher animal by cutting the <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i>, <b>or the majority of</b> the <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i>, <b>and</b> the animal <b>is still twitching, Ḥizkiyya says: There is no</b> prohibition against eating its <b>limbs. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: There is</b> a prohibition against eating its <b>limbs. Rabbi Elazar said: Take that</b> opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan in your hand</b> and accept it, <b>as Rav Oshaya teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion.
<b>As Rav Oshaya teaches</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Oholot</i> 2:1): In the case of <b>a Jew who slaughtered a non-kosher animal for</b> the consumption of <b>a gentile,</b> if <b>he slaughtered</b> it by cutting <b>two</b> <i>simanim</i> <b>or the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>, <b>and</b> the animal is still <b>twitching,</b> the animal <b>imparts impurity of food; but</b> so long as it is twitching it does <b>not</b> impart <b>the impurity of</b> animal <b>carcasses.</b>
<b>A limb that separates from</b> this twitching animal is considered <b>like</b> a limb that <b>separates from a living</b> animal, and as such it imparts the impurity of a carcass. <b>And flesh that separates from</b> this twitching animal is considered <b>like flesh that separates from a living</b> animal, and as such it does not impart impurity. <b>And it is prohibited for the descendants of Noah</b> to consume the flesh that separates from this twitching animal, <b>and</b> this prohibition applies <b>even after its soul departs.</b> This ruling of Rav Oshaya is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
The Gemara cites the continuation of the <i>Tosefta</i>: In the case where a Jew slaughtered a non-kosher animal for a gentile’s consumption, if <b>he slaughtered</b> it by cutting only <b>one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>or the majority of one</b> <i>siman</i>, and the animal is still twitching, the animal <b>does not impart the impurity of food</b> because the slaughter was invalid. Similarly, if he did not perform a valid slaughter but rather <b>stabbed</b> the animal, the animal <b>has no impurity whatsoever</b> while it is still twitching.
<b>And</b> similarly, in the case of <b>a gentile who slaughtered a kosher animal for</b> the consumption of <b>a Jew, and</b> the animal <b>is</b> still <b>twitching,</b> the animal <b>imparts the impurity of food</b> because it is considered to be food, <b>but</b> so long as it is twitching it does <b>not</b> impart <b>the impurity of an animal carcass.</b>
<b>A limb that separates from</b> this twitching animal is considered <b>like</b> a limb that <b>separates from a living</b> animal, and as such it imparts the impurity of a carcass. <b>And flesh that separates from</b> this twitching animal is considered <b>like</b> flesh that <b>separates from a living</b> animal, and as such it does not impart the impurity of food. <b>And it is prohibited for the descendants of Noah</b> to consume the flesh that separates from this twitching animal, <b>and</b> this prohibition applies <b>even after its soul departs.</b>
If the gentile <b>slaughtered</b> the kosher animal by cutting only <b>one</b> <i>siman</i> <b>or the majority of one</b> <i>siman</i>, and the animal is still twitching, the animal <b>does not impart impurity of food</b> because the slaughter was not valid. Similarly, if he <b>stabbed</b> the animal rather than slaughtering it properly, <b>it has no impurity whatsoever.</b>
If <b>a gentile</b> partially <b>slaughtered</b> a kosher animal <b>in a place that does not render</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> i.e., unfit for consumption due to a mortal wound, e.g., he cut half of the windpipe, <b>and</b> then <b>a Jew came and completed</b> the slaughter, the animal is <b>fit</b> for consumption.
But if <b>a Jew slaughtered</b> the animal, <b>either in a place that renders</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> e.g., he cut the majority of the windpipe, <b>or in a place that does not render</b> the animal <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> e.g., he only partially cut the windpipe, <b>and</b> then <b>a gentile came and completed</b> the slaughter, <b>his slaughter is not valid.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>One who wishes to eat from</b> the meat of a slaughtered <b>animal before its soul departs may cut an olive-bulk of meat from the area of its slaughter,</b> the neck, <b>and salt it very well,</b> i.e., more than is normally required, <b>and rinse it very well</b> in water to remove the salt and blood, <b>and</b> then <b>wait until</b> the animal’s <b>soul departs, and</b> then <b>eat it. Both a gentile and a Jew are permitted to</b> eat <b>it</b> because the prohibition against eating a limb from a living animal is not applicable in such a case.
The Gemara notes: This <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Idi bar Avin, as Rav Idi bar Avin said</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan said: One who wants to be healthy should cut an olive-bulk of meat from the area of the slaughter, and salt it very well and rinse it very well, and</b> then <b>wait until</b> the animal’s <b>soul departs,</b> and then <b>both a gentile and a Jew are permitted to</b> eat <b>it.</b>
§It was previously taught in the <i>baraita</i> that if a Jew slaughtered a non-kosher animal for a gentile’s consumption, or a gentile slaughtered a kosher animal for a Jew’s consumption, that animal imparts impurity of food when it is twitching after the slaughter. With regard to that <i>halakha</i>, <b>Rabbi Elazar raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in such a case if <b>one interrupted</b> the slaughter or <b>pressed</b> on the knife during the slaughter? Do these acts, which normally invalidate slaughter, also invalidate this slaughter, or does the slaughter in this case not have to fulfill all of the halakhic requirements of valid slaughter in order to render the slaughtered animal as food with regard to imparting the impurity of food?
<b>A certain elder</b> resolved this dilemma and <b>said to him: Rabbi Yoḥanan said as follows:</b> This case <b>requires a valid slaughter</b> in every detail, <b>just like</b> a Jew slaughtering <b>a kosher animal.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>To what</b> requirement does <b>valid</b> slaughter just like a kosher animal refer? <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It is referring to the requirement of <b>examining the knife</b> before the slaughter.
<b>Rabbi Zeira asked Rav Sheshet:</b> If a non-kosher animal slaughtered by a Jew is twitching under the same roof as a corpse, and the animal swallowed items before being slaughtered, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> those swallowed items that are inside the animal? Is the animal considered to be living and therefore <b>it should save</b> these items <b>that are swallowed inside it</b> from the impurity transmitted by the corpse to all items under the same roof? Or is the animal considered to be dead and therefore the items become impure?
<b>Rav Sheshet said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: Since it is established that such an animal is considered to be dead and <b>imparts impurity of food,</b> is it possible that it <b>saves</b> those items inside it from impurity? Certainly it does not. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him</b> in response: It is also established that such an animal <b>does not impart impurity of carcasses and</b> is considered to be a living animal in that regard. How is it possible that the animal <b>does not save</b> those items inside it from impurity?
<b>Abaye</b> resolved the dilemma and <b>said:</b> It is proper to treat this case stringently. Therefore, such an animal <b>does not save</b> the items <b>that are swallowed inside it because it imparts impurity of food. But one who engages in bestiality with</b> such an animal <b>is liable because</b> the animal <b>does not impart impurity of a carcass</b> and is considered to be living in that regard.
§The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>the meat residue</b> attached to the hide after flaying that was collected, if there is an olive-bulk of it in one place it imparts impurity of an animal carcass, and one who contracts impurity from it and eats consecrated foods or enters the Temple is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for it. <b>Rav Huna says</b> in explanation: This <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> applicable only when a halakhically competent person <b>collected</b> the meat residue in one place, but not if the meat residue was collected by a child or without human intervention. By collecting it in one place, the person indicates that he considers it to be food.
<b>And Rav Huna says:</b> In a case of <b>two</b> pieces of flesh of an animal carcass, each measuring <b>half an olive-</b>bulk, <b>that are</b> attached <b>to the hide, the hide nullifies them,</b> as the hide does not impart the impurity of a carcass. Consequently, these pieces do not impart impurity either.

Daf 122a

The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is the statement of Rav Huna? It is taught in the mishna (124a) that in a case where the hide of an unslaughtered carcass was attached to two half olive-bulks of flesh, Rabbi Yishmael says that the hide imparts the impurity of an unslaughtered carcass by means of carrying but not by means of contact with the flesh, because one touches them separately whereas one carries them together. Rabbi Akiva says: One contracts impurity neither by means of contact with the hide nor by means of carrying it.
<b>If</b> one maintains that Rav Huna’s statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael, didn’t</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>say</b> that the <b>hide does not nullify</b> the attached flesh and therefore the one who carries it becomes impure with the impurity of a carcass? <b>And if</b> one maintains that Rav Huna’s statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva,</b> then it is <b>obvious,</b> as <b>didn’t</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>say</b> that <b>the hide nullifies</b> the flesh and therefore one who carries it does not become impure?
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the statement of Rav Huna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael. And when Rabbi Yishmael said</b> that <b>the hide does not nullify</b> the flesh, <b>that statement</b> applies to a case <b>where an animal severed</b> the hide. <b>But</b> in a case where a person used <b>a knife</b> to <b>flay</b> the hide, the hide <b>nullifies</b> the attached flesh.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a refutation to this explanation of the statement of Rav Huna from that which is taught in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>the meat residue</b> attached to the hide after flaying <b>that was collected, if there is an olive-bulk</b> of it <b>in one place</b> it imparts impurity of an animal carcass, and one who contracts impurity from it and eats consecrated foods or enters the Temple <b>is liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for it. And Rav Huna says</b> in explanation of this statement of Rabbi Yehuda: This <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> applicable only when a halakhically competent person <b>collected</b> the meat residue in one place, but not if the meat residue was collected by a child or without human intervention.
Since Rav Huna interprets the statement of Rabbi Yehuda as referring to a case where a halakhically competent person collected the pieces of flesh, the mishna must be discussing a case where such a person flayed the hide with a knife in multiple places and then collected the pieces of flesh attached to the hide. Evidently, the hide does not nullify the flesh because if the hide did nullify the flesh, that flesh would not impart the impurity of a carcass even if it were later collected. Therefore, the Gemara challenges: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Yishmael, even</b> in a case where a person used <b>a knife</b> to <b>flay</b> the hide, the hide <b>does not nullify</b> the flesh, accordingly, <b>Rav Huna said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> that a hide flayed by a knife does not nullify the flesh, and therefore the flesh imparts the impurity of a carcass if a person collected the pieces.
<b>But if you say</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Yishmael,</b> in a case where a person used <b>a knife</b> to <b>flay</b> the hide, the hide <b>nullifies</b> the flesh and therefore the flesh does not impart the impurity of a carcass even if a halakhically competent person collected the pieces, then <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>did Rav Huna say</b> that the hide does not nullify the flesh and that the pieces of flesh that one collected impart the impurity of a carcass?
The Gemara responds: <b>Rather,</b> it is necessary to explain the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael differently. <b>Actually, according to Rabbi Yishmael</b> even a hide <b>flayed by a knife does not nullify</b> the attached flesh. <b>And Rav Huna said</b> his statement that the hide nullifies attached pieces of flesh <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the hide nullifies the flesh according to Rabbi Akiva? Rav Huna’s statement is unnecessary. The Gemara answers: Rav Huna’s statement is necessary <b>lest you say: When Rabbi Akiva said</b> that the hide nullifies the attached pieces of flesh, <b>that statement</b> applies only to a case where a person used <b>a knife</b> to <b>flay</b> the animal. <b>But</b> if <b>an animal severed</b> the hide, the hide <b>does not nullify</b> the flesh.
Therefore, Rav Huna <b>teaches us</b> that <b>the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva</b> is <b>because the hide nullifies</b> the flesh, and there <b>is no difference</b> whether <b>an animal severed</b> the hide, <b>and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether a person used <b>a knife</b> to <b>flay</b> the hide. This statement of Rav Huna is therefore <b>in accordance with that which the latter clause</b> of that mishna <b>teaches: For what</b> reason <b>does Rabbi Akiva deem</b> one ritually <b>pure in</b> a case where he moved both half olive-bulks with <b>the hide?</b> It is <b>because the hide</b> separates between them and <b>nullifies them.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>These</b> are the entities <b>whose skin</b> has the same halakhic status <b>as their flesh: The skin of</b> a dead <b>person,</b> which imparts impurity like his flesh; <b>and the skin of a domesticated pig,</b> which is soft and eaten by gentiles, and imparts the impurity of an animal carcass like its flesh. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even the skin of a wild boar</b> has the same status.
<b>And</b> the halakhic status of the skin of all of the following animals is also like that of their flesh: <b>The skin of the hump of a young camel</b> that did not yet toughen; <b>and the skin of the head of a young calf; and the hide of the hooves; and the skin of the womb; and the skin of</b> an animal <b>fetus</b> in the womb of a slaughtered animal; <b>and the skin beneath the tail</b> of a ewe; <b>and the skin of the gecko [<i>anaka</i>], and the desert monitor [<i>ko’aḥ</i>], and the lizard [<i>leta’a</i>], and the skink [<i>ḥomet</i>],</b> four of the eight creeping animals that impart ritual impurity after death. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The halakhic status of the skin of <b>the lizard</b> is <b>like</b> that of the skin of <b>the weasel</b> and is not like that of its flesh.
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of</b> these skins, in a case <b>where one tanned them or</b> spread them on the ground and <b>trod upon them for the period of time required for tanning,</b> they are no longer classified as flesh and are <b>ritually pure, except for the skin of a person,</b> which maintains the status of flesh. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says:</b> All <b>eight creeping animals</b> enumerated in the Torah <b>have skins</b> whose halakhic status is not that of flesh.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The first clause of the mishna teaches that the skin of a dead person imparts impurity like his flesh. With regard to this, <b>Ulla says: The skin of</b> a dead <b>person is pure by Torah law; and what</b> is the <b>reason</b> that the Sages <b>said</b> that it is <b>impure?</b> It is a rabbinic <b>decree lest a person fashion mats</b> from <b>the skins of his</b> deceased <b>father and mother.</b>
<b>And there are those who teach</b> this statement of Ulla <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of</b> these skins, in a case <b>where one tanned them or</b> spread them on the ground and <b>trod upon them for the period of time required for tanning,</b> they are no longer classified as flesh and are <b>ritually pure, except for the skin of a person,</b> which maintains the status of flesh. With regard to that clause, <b>Ulla says: The skin of</b> a dead <b>person that one tanned is pure by Torah law; and what</b> is the <b>reason</b> that the Sages <b>said</b> that it is <b>impure?</b> It is a rabbinic <b>decree lest a person fashion mats</b> from <b>the skins of his</b> deceased <b>father and mother.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>The one who teaches</b> the statement of Ulla that the skin of a corpse is pure by Torah law <b>with regard to the first clause</b> of the mishna, which discusses a softer hide that is not tanned, <b>all the more so</b> would teach it <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna. <b>But the one who teaches</b> this statement <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna holds that only the tanned skin of a corpse is pure by Torah law, <b>but</b> does not teach it <b>with regard to the first clause</b> of the mishna because he holds that the <b>impurity</b> of the skin of a corpse that is not tanned is <b>by Torah law.</b>
§The mishna teaches that according to the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>the skin of</b> a domesticated <b>pig</b> imparts impurity of an animal carcass like its flesh, indicates that the skin of a wild boar does not impart impurity of a carcass. Rabbi Yehuda disagrees and holds that even the skin of a wild boar has the same status as its flesh. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>this</b> skin of a wild boar <b>is tough</b> and therefore its status is not that of flesh, <b>but that</b> skin of a domesticated pig <b>is soft</b> and therefore its status is that of flesh. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>this</b> skin of a wild boar <b>is also soft</b> and therefore its status is that of flesh.
§The mishna teaches that the <b>skin of the hump of a young camel</b> that did not yet toughen imparts impurity of a carcass like its flesh. The Gemara asks: <b>And for how long is a camel</b> considered <b>young</b> and the status of the skin considered like that of the flesh? <b>Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: As long as</b> the camel <b>has not carried</b> a burden.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the skin of a camel <b>whose time,</b> i.e., age, <b>to carry</b> a burden <b>has arrived, but it has not</b> yet <b>carried</b> one? <b>Abaye raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the skin of a camel <b>whose time to carry</b> a burden <b>has not arrived, but it has</b> nevertheless <b>carried</b> one? The Gemara answers: These dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Reish Lakish sat and raised a dilemma:</b> For <b>how long is a camel</b> considered <b>young? Rabbi Yishmael bar Abba said to him: This is what Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: As long as</b> the camel <b>has not carried</b> a burden. In response to his answer, Reish Lakish honored him and <b>said to him: Sit opposite me.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira sat and raised a dilemma:</b> For <b>how long is a camel</b> considered <b>young? Ravin bar Ḥinnana said to him: This is what Ulla said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: As long as</b> the camel <b>has not carried</b> a burden. Ravin bar Ḥinnana then <b>repeated</b> his answer to Rabbi Zeira. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: Do you have</b> only <b>one</b> <i>halakha</i> to <b>say,</b> and that is why you are repeating it?
The Gemara points out: <b>Come</b> and <b>see what</b> the difference is <b>between the harsh</b> scholars <b>of Eretz Yisrael,</b> such as Reish Lakish, <b>and the saintly ones of Babylonia,</b> such as Rabbi Zeira. Although Reish Lakish was known for his harsh nature, he was the one who honored the Sage who resolved his dilemma, whereas Rabbi Zeira responded sharply to the one who taught him this <i>halakha</i>.
§The mishna teaches: <b>And the skin of the head</b> of a young calf has the same halakhic status as the flesh with regard to impurity. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> for <b>how long is a calf</b> considered <b>young? Ulla says:</b> It is considered young in <b>its</b> first <b>year of age. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> For <b>as long as</b> the calf is <b>suckling. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>what</b> case <b>is Ulla speaking?</b> Is he referring to a calf that is in <b>its</b> first <b>year of age and is</b> still <b>suckling,</b>

Daf 122b

<b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> disagreed with Ulla and <b>said to him:</b> A calf is considered young <b>as long as it is suckling,</b> even after its first year of age? According to this explanation, Ulla considers a calf to be young only when it is both in its first year and suckling, and Rabbi Yoḥanan considers a calf that is suckling to be young even if it is beyond its first year.
<b>Or perhaps, does Ulla say</b> that a calf is considered young if it is in <b>its</b> first <b>year of age, whether it is suckling or whether it is no</b> longer <b>suckling, and Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him:</b> The calf must be in <b>its</b> first <b>year of age and it</b> must also be <b>suckling</b> in order to be considered young?
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The calf is considered young <b>the entire time that it is suckling. And if it is so</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan requires a calf to be both in its first year and suckling to be considered young, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>should have</b> said: <b>And</b> provided the calf <b>is suckling,</b> indicating an additional condition. <b>Conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan considers a calf that is suckling to be young even if it is beyond its first year, and that Ulla considers only a calf that is both in its first year and suckling to be young.
§The Gemara continues to discuss the skin of the head of a young calf. <b>Reish Lakish asked Rabbi Yoḥanan: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to whether <b>the skin of the head of a young calf</b> that is still fit to be eaten <b>imparts impurity?</b> Is the status of the skin like that of flesh or not? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: It does not impart impurity.</b>
Reish Lakish <b>said to him:</b> But didn’t <b>you teach us, our teacher,</b> that it says in the mishna: <b>These</b> are the entities <b>whose skin</b> has the same halakhic status <b>as their flesh, and the skin of the head of a young calf</b> is included among them? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Reish Lakish: <b>Do not provoke me</b> by asking such a question. <b>I teach that</b> mishna <b>in the singular,</b> i.e., that mishna is in accordance with an individual opinion and is contrary to the majority opinion. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with it.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who slaughters a burnt offering</b> with the intention <b>to burn an olive-bulk of the skin beneath the tail outside its</b> designated <b>area,</b> i.e., outside the Temple courtyard, renders the offering <b>unfit, but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i></b> for one who partakes of the offering. If he intended to burn it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> i.e., not on that day, then it is rendered <b><i>piggul</i>, and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> partaking of <b>it.</b> Since this particular area of the skin is soft, its status is therefore like that of flesh. This is the opinion of the Rabbis.
<b>Elazar ben Yehuda of Aveilum says in the name of Rabbi Ya’akov, and so Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda of Kefar Ikom says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>both</b> to <b>the hide of the hooves, and the skin of the head of a young calf, and the skin beneath the tail, and all</b> of the entities <b>that the Sages listed with regard to ritual impurity</b> that the halakhic status of <b>their skin is like that of their flesh, including the skin of the womb.</b>
Therefore, one who sacrifices a burnt offering with the intention to burn an olive-bulk of any of these skins <b>outside its</b> designated <b>area</b> renders the offering <b>unfit, but there is no</b> liability for <b><i>karet</i></b> for one who partakes of the offering. If he intended to burn it <b>beyond its</b> designated <b>time,</b> then it is rendered <b><i>piggul</i>, and one is liable</b> to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> eating <b>it.</b> Therefore, the mishna is in accordance with the individual opinion of Elazar ben Yehuda, who holds that all of the skins listed in the mishna have the status of flesh, and not in accordance with the Rabbis’ opinion that only the skin beneath the tail has the status of flesh.
§The mishna teaches: <b>And the hide of the hooves</b> has the status of flesh with regard to imparting impurity. The Gemara asks: To <b>what</b> is <b>the</b> term <b>hooves</b> referring? <b>Rav says:</b> It is <b>literally</b> referring to <b>the hooves. Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> It is referring to the skin of the section of <b>the knee</b> at the top of the lower bone, <b>which is sold with the head.</b> This skin of the knee, and of the lower bone attached to it, has the status of flesh.
§The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> the halakhic status of <b>the skin of the gecko,</b> and the desert monitor, and the lizard, and the skink, four of the eight creeping animals that impart ritual impurity after death, is like that of their flesh with regard to imparting impurity. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: “And these are they which are impure for you among the creeping animals that creep upon the earth: The weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kinds. And the gecko, and the desert monitor, and the lizard, and the skink, and the chameleon. These are <b>they which are impure</b> for you among all that swarm; whosoever touches them, when they are dead, shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:29–32). The term “they which are” in the expression “they which are impure” seems superfluous, and serves <b>to include the skins of</b> these animals as having the same halakhic status <b>as their flesh.</b>
One <b>might</b> have thought that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even</b> to <b>all</b> of the creeping animals listed in the verses. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “These,”</b> indicating that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to these animals mentioned in the mishna, i.e., the gecko, the desert monitor, the lizard, and the skink.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> the term <b>“these” written with regard to all</b> eight of the creeping animals listed in the verse? <b>Rav says:</b> After mentioning the weasel, the mouse, and the great lizard the verse states: <b>“After its kinds.”</b> Therefore, the verse <b>interrupted the</b> previous <b>matter</b> and taught that the status of the skin is like that of the flesh only with regard to the creeping animals mentioned in the latter part of the verse.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> since the chameleon is listed in the latter part of the verse, <b>let</b> the <b>chameleon also be counted</b> among the animals whose skin has the status of flesh. <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: Rav,</b> who interprets the verse in this manner, has the status of <b>a <i>tanna</i>, and</b> unlike the mishna, <b>he teaches</b> that the skin of the <b>chameleon</b> has the status of flesh.
The Gemara asks: <b>But the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>does not teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>chameleon.</b> According to his opinion, why doesn’t the skin of the chameleon have the status of flesh?
<b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said: The <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda that</b> the halakhic status of the skin of the lizard, even though it is mentioned in the latter part of the verse, is like that of the skin of the weasel and is not like that of its flesh. Rabbi Yehuda does not derive that the status of the skin is like that of flesh from the verse that states: “They which are impure.” Rather, he <b>follows the texture</b> of the skin of each creeping animal when deciding whether the status of its skin is like that of its flesh.
The first <i>tanna</i> of the mishna and Rabbi Yehuda agree that the texture of the skin of the gecko, the desert monitor, and the skink is soft and therefore the status of their skin is like that of their flesh; <b>and they disagree with regard to the texture</b> of the skin <b>of the lizard.</b> Rabbi Yehuda classifies its skin as tough, and the first <i>tanna</i> of the mishna classifies its skin as soft.
§The mishna teaches: <b>And all of these</b> skins, in a case <b>where one tanned them</b> or spread them on the ground and trod upon them, are no longer classified as flesh and are ritually pure. The Gemara objects: The mishna indicates that if one <b>trod</b> upon them they <b>are</b> no longer classified as flesh, but if one <b>did not tread</b> upon them they do <b>not</b> cease being classified as flesh. <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach: The ear of a donkey that one sewed into his basket is pure</b> and is no longer classified as flesh. Just as the ear is no longer classified as flesh once it is <b>sewed</b> into a basket, so too skin that is spread on the ground, <b>even if</b> one <b>did not tread</b> upon it, should no longer be classified as flesh.
The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> this is not difficult. <b>Sewing</b> the ear is an action that nullifies the ear’s classification as flesh. But spreading skin on the ground is not an action that nullifies the skin’s classification as flesh unless one trod upon the skin. Therefore, if one <b>trod</b> upon the skin it <b>is</b> no longer classified as flesh, but if one <b>did not tread</b> upon it, it does <b>not</b> cease being classified as flesh.
The mishna states that the skin must be trodden upon for the period required for tanning. The Gemara clarifies: <b>How long is the period</b> required <b>for tanning? Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> The time which it takes one to walk <b>four <i>mil</i>.</b>
§Since the period of time it takes to walk four <i>mil</i> was mentioned, the Gemara lists <i>halakhot</i> that employ this period of time. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says in the name of Reish Lakish: With regard to</b> a professional <b>kneader</b> who is careful to maintain the ritual purity of the dough that he kneads for others, he must walk up to four <i>mil</i> in order to purify the vessel he is using by immersing it in a ritual bath. He is not required to walk farther than this unless the person hiring him pays for him to do so.
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>with regard to prayer,</b> one who is traveling may not pray where he is if there is a synagogue within four <i>mil</i> ahead of him, but rather must continue traveling in order to pray in the synagogue. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>with regard to washing</b> one’s <b>hands</b> before eating, one who is traveling may not eat without washing his hands if there is water within <b>four <i>mil</i></b> ahead of him.
With regard to this statement of Reish Lakish, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b>

Daf 123a

It was <b>Aivu</b> who <b>said</b> this statement in the name of Reish Lakish and not Rabbi Abbahu, <b>and he said four</b> <i>halakhot</i>, not three, with regard to the measure of four <i>mil</i>, <b>and</b> the fourth <b>one of them</b> is the <i>halakha</i> mentioned in the mishna: Skins that one spread on the ground and trod upon for the period required for <b>tanning,</b> i.e., the amount of time it takes to walk four <i>mil</i>, are no longer classified as flesh and are ritually pure.
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> With regard to prayer and washing one’s hands, the Sages <b>taught</b> that one must travel four <i>mil</i> to find a synagogue or water <b>only</b> if the synagogue or the water is <b>ahead of him,</b> in the direction that he is traveling. <b>But</b> if it is <b>behind him, he</b> need <b>not return even one <i>mil</i>. Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov said: From</b> this statement one may infer that <b>it is</b> specifically <b>a <i>mil</i> that one</b> need <b>not return; but one must return</b> for a synagogue or water that is at a distance of <b>less than</b> one <b><i>mil</i>.</b>
§The mishna states that the skin of a human corpse is impure like its flesh. <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (8:16): In the case of <b>a legion traveling</b> for warfare <b>from place to place, and</b> one member of the legion <b>enters a house, the house is impure, as there is no legion that does not have several scalps</b> that its soldiers carry around for witchcraft. <b>And you should not be surprised</b> that they do so, <b>as the scalp [<i>karkefal</i>] of Rabbi Yishmael</b> was <b>placed on the heads of kings.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The halakhic status of the hide of an animal after it was flayed is no longer like its flesh in terms of becoming impure and imparting impurity. Nevertheless, in the case of <b>one who flays</b> either <b>a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal; a ritually pure</b> animal that was slaughtered properly and afterward came in contact with impurity, e.g., the one flaying it is impure, <b>or a ritually impure</b> unslaughtered carcass; <b>a small animal,</b> e.g., sheep, <b>or a large animal,</b> e.g., cattle; and even after flaying the animal’s hide is still partially attached to the flesh, the hide’s halakhic status remains that of flesh in some circumstances.
These circumstances are: If he is flaying the animal <b>for</b> the purpose of using the hide as <b>a carpet,</b> a tablecloth, or to drape over a couch, in which case he would cut the hide along the length of the animal from head to tail and then remove the hide from both sides, its halakhic status remains that of flesh until he has flayed <b>the measure of grasping</b> the hide, i.e., two handbreadths.
<b>And</b> if he is flaying the animal <b>for</b> the purpose of crafting a leather <b>jug,</b> in which case he cuts a circle near the animal’s neck and removes the hide in a downward movement, its halakhic status remains that of flesh <b>until he flays the</b> animal’s entire <b>breast.</b>
In the case of <b>one who</b> seeks to fashion a jug and begins <b>flaying from the legs,</b> until he removes the animal’s hide in <b>its entirety,</b> the entire hide is considered as having <b>a connection</b> with the flesh and its halakhic status remains that of flesh <b>with regard to impurity,</b> i.e., with regard <b>to becoming impure and with regard to imparting impurity.</b> If one removed the entire hide except for <b>the hide over the neck, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: It is not</b> considered to have <b>a connection</b> to the flesh, <b>and the Rabbis say:</b> It is considered to have <b>a connection</b> to the flesh <b>until he removes the</b> animal’s <b>hide in its entirety,</b> including the neck.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: If one flays an animal for the purpose of making a carpet out of it, the halakhic status of the hide remains that of flesh until he has flayed the measure of grasping the hide. The Gemara asks: <b>From that</b> point <b>forward,</b> i.e., when one has flayed more than the measure of grasping of the hide, <b>what</b> is the status of the hide?
<b>Rav says:</b> The entire section of the hide <b>that has been flayed is pure</b> because it no longer serves the flesh as a handle. But the hide that is still attached to the flesh serves the flesh as protection, and therefore it transmits impurity to the flesh and from the flesh, and joins together with the flesh to constitute the requisite measure to impart the impurity of food. <b>Rabbi Asi says: One handbreadth</b> of the flayed hide <b>that is next to the flesh is susceptible to impurity.</b> Since the one who flays the hide holds this handbreadth of the hide while flaying, this section of the hide serves the flesh as a handle.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabbi Asi from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who flays</b> an unslaughtered animal carcass, once he has cut the hide along the length of the animal from head to tail and then removed <b>this measure</b> of the hide from both sides, then <b>from that</b> point <b>forward,</b> a person <b>who touches the flayed</b> hide <b>is pure,</b> because the flayed hide does not impart impurity of a carcass. <b>What, is it not</b> discussing <b>even the handbreadth</b> of hide <b>next to the flesh,</b> contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Asi? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> there is no proof from this <i>baraita</i>, as it may be discussing the flayed hide <b>except for the handbreadth next to the flesh.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a refutation of the opinion of Rabbi Asi from a <i>baraita</i>: Once an animal carcass has been flayed more than the measure of grasping the hide, if one touches <b>the hide opposite the flesh</b> before that hide was flayed <b>he is impure.</b> This statement indicates that the attached <b>hide opposite the flesh is impure, but one handbreadth</b> of the flayed hide <b>that is next to the flesh is pure,</b> contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Asi. The Gemara answers: There is no proof from this <i>baraita</i>. <b>The <i>tanna</i></b> who taught this <i>baraita</i> was referring to <b>the entire handbreadth</b> of flayed hide <b>next to the flesh</b> by <b>calling it the hide opposite the flesh.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a refutation of the opinion of Rabbi Asi from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:18): In the case of <b>one who flays a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal, a ritually pure</b> animal <b>or a ritually impure</b> unslaughtered carcass, <b>a small animal or a large animal,</b> if he is flaying the animal <b>for</b> the purpose of using the hide as <b>a carpet,</b> the halakhic status of the hide remains that of flesh until he has flayed <b>the measure of grasping</b> it, <b>and</b> one who touches <b>one handbreadth</b> of the flayed hide <b>next to the flesh</b> remains <b>pure,</b> contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Asi.
The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with the first handbreadth</b> of hide that is flayed in addition to the measure of grasping. In a case where only one handbreadth of hide has been flayed in addition to the measure of grasping, it is more comfortable for the one flaying the hide to grasp the edge of the hide rather than the handbreadth of hide that is nearest to the flesh. Furthermore, the most comfortable way to continue flaying is to do so with a knife without grasping the flayed hide at all. Therefore, Rabbi Asi concedes that the hide in this case does not serve the flesh as a handle and consequently does not impart impurity. But afterward, when one has already flayed more than three handbreadths of hide, one holds the handbreadth of hide next to the flesh while continuing to flay the animal, and since it serves the flesh as a handle it imparts impurity.
§The mishna teaches that the hide’s halakhic status remains that of flesh until he has flayed the measure of grasping the hide. It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How much is the measure of grasping?</b> It is <b>one handbreadth.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: The measure of grasping is <b>two handbreadths?</b>
<b>Abaye says:</b> The first <i>baraita</i> is referring to one who grasps <b>a double handbreadth</b> by folding the first two handbreadths together and grasping them. <b>This</b> explanation of Abaye <b>is also taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (8:18): <b>How much is the measure of grasping?</b> It is <b>a double handbreadth.</b>
§The Gemara discusses a matter similar to the previous discussion of a partially flayed hide. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 28:8): A ritually impure garment that tears is rendered pure because it is no longer considered a useable garment. In the case of a ritually impure <b>garment that one began to tear, once the majority of</b> the garment <b>is torn,</b> the two sections are <b>no longer</b> considered as having <b>a connection, and</b> since it is no longer considered a useable garment, it <b>is pure.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only with regard to</b> an impure <b>garment that was</b> already <b>immersed</b> in a ritual bath <b>that day,</b> but one must wait until nightfall for the purification process to be completed in order to wear the garment while eating ritually pure food. In such a case, tearing the majority of the garment renders it pure, and the Sages did not apply the requirement that the entire garment be torn.
This is <b>because</b> the reason for this rabbinic decree is lest one tear only half of it out of concern for the damage to the garment. And <b>since</b> in this case, the owner of the garment showed <b>that he was not concerned about</b> damage to the garment by <b>immersing it</b> in a ritual bath, an act which damages the garment, so too <b>he is</b> presumably <b>not concerned about</b> the garment with regard to tearing <b>it, and he will</b> certainly <b>tear the majority of it. But a garment that was not immersed that day is not</b> rendered pure by tearing the majority of the garment due to a rabbinic <b>decree lest one come to not tear the majority</b> of the garment but only half of it.
<b>Rabba said:</b> There are <b>two refutations of</b> this <b>statement. One</b> is that the decree should apply even to a garment that was immersed that day, <b>lest</b> people who see one eating ritually pure food while wearing such a garment <b>say</b> that <b>immersion</b> of a garment <b>on the</b> same <b>day is sufficient</b> for the garment to be worn while eating ritually pure food, and there is no need to wait until nightfall. <b>And furthermore,</b> if a garment that was not immersed that day is rendered pure only by tearing the entire garment and not by tearing merely a majority of the garment, due to a decree lest one tear less than a majority of the garment,

Daf 123b

so too, with regard to <b>a bird burnt offering according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that one is required to pinch merely a majority of two <i>simanim</i> in the nape of the neck in order to prepare it for sacrifice, <b>let him decree</b> against pinching the majority of two <i>simanim</i> <b>lest one come to not perform</b> the pinching on <b>the majority of two</b> <i>simanim</i>, but rather on merely half of them.
<b>Rav Yosef</b> responded to Rabba’s two refutations and <b>said to him:</b> With regard to <b>that which you said,</b> that a rabbinic <b>decree</b> is necessary even with regard to a garment that was immersed that day <b>lest</b> onlookers <b>say</b> that <b>immersion</b> of a garment <b>on that</b> same <b>day is sufficient,</b> there is no reason for such a concern. This is because <b>its tear proves</b> that the garment is pure due to the tear, and not because one is allowed to wear an immersed garment while eating pure food before sunset.
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which you said,</b> that with regard to <b>a bird burnt offering according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, let him decree</b> against pinching the majority of the <i>simanim</i> lest one fail to pinch the majority, in fact there is no reason for such a concern. Rav Yosef explains: The reason there is no concern is that pinching is performed by <b>the priests,</b> who <b>are vigilant</b> with regard to mitzvot.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a refutation to Rabba bar Avuh’s explanation of the mishna in tractate <i>Kelim</i> from the mishna here: In the case of <b>one who flays a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal, a ritually impure</b> animal <b>or a ritually pure</b> animal, <b>a small</b> animal <b>or a large</b> animal, if he is flaying the animal <b>for</b> the purpose of using the hide as <b>a carpet,</b> the halakhic status of the hide remains that of flesh until he has flayed <b>the measure of grasping</b> the hide.
The Gemara infers: <b>But</b> after one has flayed <b>more than a measure of grasping</b> the hide, the hide is <b>pure. Why</b> is this so? <b>Let</b> the Sages <b>decree</b> that even a hide that was flayed more than the measure of grasping is susceptible to impurity <b>lest</b> one who intends to flay more than a measure of grasping <b>come to complete only a measure of grasping, and he is</b> thereby <b>touching</b> a source of <b>impurity, and we</b> might mistakenly <b>deem him pure.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the mishna were discussing <b>impurity by Torah law, indeed</b> the Sages would issue such a decree. But <b>here we are dealing with impurity by rabbinic law,</b> and therefore the Sages did not issue such a decree.
The Gemara objects: According to this answer, the case in the mishna of <b>an impure</b> person who flays <b>a pure</b> animal <b>works out well.</b> That could be referring to a case of impurity by rabbinic law. But in every case of <b>a pure</b> person who flays <b>an impure</b> animal, i.e., an unslaughtered animal carcass, the <b>impurity</b> of the animal <b>is by Torah law.</b> Therefore, in such a case the Sages should have issued a decree. The Gemara explains: The case taught in the mishna of a person who flays an impure animal is referring <b>to</b> a pure animal that was properly slaughtered, but after the slaughter the animal was found to have a wound that would have caused it to die within twelve months, thereby rendering it <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b> Such an animal imparts impurity by rabbinic law.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> a pure animal that is found to be <b>a <i>tereifa</i> capable of imparting impurity?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel’s father, as Shmuel’s father said: A <i>tereifa</i> that one slaughtered imparts impurity</b> by rabbinic law <b>if</b> it is <b>a sacrificial</b> animal. Accordingly, the mishna is referring to the case of a sacrificial animal that was found to be a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a refutation of Rabba bar Avuh’s explanation of the mishna in tractate <i>Kelim</i> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:19): <b>Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> With regard to <b>one who flays creeping animals,</b> its hide is considered to have <b>a connection</b> with the flesh, and it imparts impurity of a creeping animal <b>until he flays</b> the animal in <b>its entirety.</b>
The Gemara infers: This <i>halakha</i> applies only with regard to creeping animals, <b>but with regard to a camel</b> or other non-kosher animals, when the hide is flayed more than a measure of grasping it <b>is not</b> considered to have <b>a connection</b> with the flesh and is pure, even though when the measure of grasping is flayed it is impure. Apparently, there is no rabbinic decree that even a hide that was flayed more than the measure of grasping imparts impurity lest one who intends to flay more than a measure of grasping come to flay only a measure of grasping, contrary to the opinion of Rabba bar Avuh.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Do not say</b> that <b>this</b> statement indicates that <b>with regard to a camel,</b> when the hide is flayed more than a measure of grasping it <b>is not</b> considered to have <b>a connection</b> with the flesh. <b>Rather, say</b> that this statement indicates that only with regard to a creeping animal is the hide considered to have a connection with the flesh until one flays the animal in its entirety. But <b>with regard to</b> a camel carcass and other non-kosher animals, in a case where one seeks to fashion a jug and begins flaying from the legs, if he removed the entire hide except for <b>the hide over the neck, it is not</b> considered to have <b>a connection</b> to the flesh, <b>and</b> this statement <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri</b> stated in the mishna.
§The Gemara returns to discuss, and limit the scope of, the previously cited mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 28:8): In the case of a ritually impure garment that one began to tear, once the majority of the garment is torn, the two sections are no longer considered to have a connection, and the garment is pure. <b>Rav Huna says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> that an impure garment, most of which has been torn, is no longer impure <b>only when one did not leave</b> untorn a part of the garment that is <b>the measure of a scarf. But</b> if <b>he left</b> an untorn piece that is <b>the measure of a scarf, it is</b> considered to have <b>a connection,</b> and the garment remains ritually impure.
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> The mishna <b>taught only</b> with regard to an impure <b>garment,</b> most of which has been torn, that it is no longer impure, <b>but</b> an impure <b>hide</b> that was torn in such a manner remains impure because it is <b>repairable. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even a hide</b> that was torn in such a manner is no longer impure because it <b>is not repairable.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 26:9): In the case of <b>a hide</b> that is <b>impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>treading,</b> if the owner <b>intended with regard to</b> the hide to make it <b>into straps and sandals, when he applies a scalpel [<i>izmel</i>] to</b> the hide, the hide becomes <b>pure;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say:</b> The hide does not become pure <b>until he reduces</b> the size of the hide to a measure of less <b>than five handbreadths. In any event, when he reduces</b> the hide to a measure of less than five handbreadths, everyone agrees that it becomes <b>pure. Why</b> is this so? <b>Let us say</b> according the opinion of Reish Lakish that the hide should not become pure, as it is <b>repairable.</b>
Reish Lakish responded to Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>When I said that</b> a torn hide is <b>repairable,</b> I was referring to a case <b>where one cut</b> the hide in a <b>straight</b> line. By contrast, <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where one cut</b> the hide <b>in a circular manner.</b> In such a case, the hide is not repairable.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Reish Lakish from the mishna: In the case of <b>one who flays</b> either <b>a domesticated animal or an undomesticated animal, a ritually pure</b> animal <b>or a ritually impure</b> animal, <b>a small</b> animal <b>or a large</b> animal, if he is flaying the animal <b>for</b> the purpose of using the hide as <b>a carpet,</b> the halakhic status of the hide remains that of flesh until he has flayed <b>the measure of grasping.</b> Rabbi Yirmeya infers: <b>But</b> once one has flayed <b>more than the measure of grasping,</b> the hide is <b>pure. But</b> according to Reish Lakish, <b>why</b> is this so? <b>Let us say</b> that the hide is <b>repairable,</b> i.e., it can be sewn back on. <b>Rabbi Avin interpreted</b> the mishna and explained that <b>one</b> piece after <b>one</b> piece, i.e., each piece that is flayed is <b>rendered fallen</b> and disconnected from the flesh, as it will never be reattached to the flesh, unlike the case of a torn hide, which may be sewn back together.
<b>Rav Yosef raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Reish Lakish from another ruling in the mishna: With regard to <b>the hide over the neck, Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri says: It is not</b> considered to have <b>a connection</b> to the flesh, as the hide is merely loosely connected to the neck itself, and it is pure. According to Reish Lakish, <b>why</b> is this so? <b>Doesn’t</b> the hide <b>exist</b> in its <b>repaired</b> state, i.e., isn’t it still connected to the neck itself? If an impure hide that was torn and can be repaired remains impure, this should certainly be the <i>halakha</i> with regard to hide that was never moved from its initial state.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: Instead of objecting to the opinion of Reish Lakish due to the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The hide covering the neck is considered to have <b>a connection</b> to the flesh, a statement that supports the opinion of Reish Lakish according to your reasoning.
<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> The dispute between Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan is irrelevant to the dispute in the mishna between Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri and the Rabbis. In the mishna, <b>they disagree with regard to</b> whether an appendage, such as the hide of the neck, that <b>protects</b> the flesh but is <b>prone to become detached by itself</b> is considered to be protection. One <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is</b> considered to be <b>protection, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is not</b> considered to be <b>protection.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Reish Lakish from a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 5:7): With regard to <b>an oven that has become impure, how does one purify it? One divides</b> the oven <b>into three</b> parts <b>and scrapes off the</b> layer of <b>plaster</b> that surrounds the oven

Daf 124a

<b>until</b> the oven itself merely rests <b>on the ground</b> and is not held in place by plaster.Breaking the oven in such a manner renders the oven pure because it is no longer considered a vessel. <b>Rabbi Meir says: It is unnecessary to scrape off the</b> layer of <b>plaster, and</b> it is certainly <b>not</b> necessary to remove it <b>until</b> the oven rests <b>on the ground. Rather, one</b> makes cuts in the oven itself, <b>reducing</b> its size <b>from within</b> the layer of plaster, i.e., without removing the layer of plaster, until the unbroken part is less <b>than four handbreadths.</b>
Rabbi Meir holds that although breaking off a minority of the structure of the oven is insufficient, <b>in any event when one reduces</b> the size of the oven to less <b>than four</b> handbreadths in height the oven is rendered <b>pure. Why</b> is this so, according to the opinion of Reish Lakish? <b>Let us say</b> that <b>this</b> oven <b>exists</b> in <b>a repairable</b> state, as the plaster holds it together, and according to Reish Lakish it should therefore be considered connected and remain impure.
<b>Rava said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: Instead of objecting to the opinion of Reish Lakish from the statement of Rabbi Meir, <b>state</b> a proof for his opinion <b>from</b> the statement <b>of the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Meir and hold that the oven becomes pure only if <b>one scrapes off the</b> layer of <b>plaster until</b> the oven rests <b>on the ground.</b> Apparently, the Rabbis hold that the oven is rendered pure only if it is completely and irreparably broken, which supports the opinion of Reish Lakish according to your reasoning.
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> Not only is there no proof against the opinion of Reish Lakish from this mishna, as the statement of the Rabbis supports his opinion, but Rabbi Meir may even accept the opinion of Reish Lakish; as <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: How does one purify an oven that became impure? Everyone,</b> even Rabbi Meir, <b>agrees</b> that one <b>divides it into three</b> parts <b>and scrapes off the</b> layer of <b>plaster until</b> the oven rests <b>on the ground.</b>
<b>And</b> anyone <b>who wishes that his oven not become</b> susceptible to <b>impurity, how does he act?</b> The Rabbis hold that he goes through the same process as is necessary in order to purify an impure oven: From the outset, <b>he divides</b> the oven <b>into three</b> parts <b>and scrapes off the</b> layer of <b>plaster until</b> the oven rests <b>on the ground. Rabbi Meir says:</b> With regard to an oven that has not yet become impure, <b>it is unnecessary to scrape off the</b> layer of <b>plaster, and</b> it is certainly <b>not</b> necessary to remove it <b>until</b> the oven rests <b>on the ground. Rather, one reduces</b> the size of the oven <b>from within</b> the layer of plaster until the unbroken part is less <b>than four handbreadths</b> in height.
§The Gemara discusses the mishna in tractate <i>Kelim</i> cited above. <b>The Master said:</b> An impure oven is rendered pure when one <b>divides it into three</b> parts, such that no one part contains the majority of the oven. But one cannot purify the oven by dividing it into two parts because one of the parts would contain the majority of the oven.
The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this mishna from another mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 5:1): A clay <b>oven</b> in <b>its original state,</b> once it is finished being built, is susceptible to ritual impurity if it is <b>four</b> handbreadths tall. <b>And</b> with regard to an oven that became impure and was subsequently broken, if <b>its remains</b> include a piece <b>four</b> handbreadths tall, that piece remains impure. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>in</b> the case of <b>a large</b> oven, <b>but in</b> the case of <b>a small</b> oven, in <b>its original state, any size</b> is sufficient for it to be susceptible to impurity. <b>Once its construction is completed,</b> if the oven became impure and was subsequently broken, <b>its remains</b> are still impure <b>in</b> a case where they contain <b>the majority of</b> the oven.
The Gemara explains: <b>And how</b> small is the size defined by the mishna as <b>any size?</b> The <b>school of Rabbi Yannai says:</b> One <b>handbreadth, as</b> people <b>make</b> toy <b>ovens one handbreadth tall.</b>
The Gemara infers: The Rabbis in that mishna hold that with regard to a large impure oven that breaks, any remaining piece that measures four handbreadths remains impure. Evidently, <b>the reason</b> that the oven remains impure is <b>because there are</b> pieces of <b>its remains</b> that measure <b>four</b> handbreadths, <b>but</b> if <b>there are no remains</b> of the oven measuring <b>four</b> handbreadths, even if a piece contains the majority of the oven, the oven is rendered <b>pure.</b> This opinion is not consistent with the opinion of the Rabbis in the previously cited mishna.
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: <b>There,</b> with regard to the opinion of the Rabbis that if there are no remains measuring four handbreadths then the oven is pure, that mishna is discussing a case <b>where one cut</b> the oven horizontally such that the pieces do not stand one on top of the other in a stable manner. <b>Here,</b> with regard to the opinion of the Rabbis that an impure oven is rendered pure only when no one piece constitutes the majority of the oven, the mishna is discussing a case <b>where one rendered</b> the oven <b>a shard [<i>gistera</i>]</b> by cutting it in half vertically, in which case a piece that contains the majority of the oven can stand on its own.
§The Gemara discusses the previously cited mishna in tractate <i>Kelim</i>. <b>The Master said:</b> In the case of a small oven, in its original state, any size is sufficient for it to be susceptible to impurity. And once its construction is completed, if the oven became impure and was subsequently broken, <b>its remains</b> are still impure if they contain <b>the majority</b> of the oven. The Gemara asks: Rabbi Yannai explained that the phrase: Any size, is referring to a measure of one handbreadth. <b>For what</b> purpose <b>is</b> a piece of an oven the size of <b>the majority of</b> one <b>handbreadth</b> usable? Since such a small piece is not functional; why should it remain impure?
<b>Abaye said:</b> The statement of the mishna: Its remains are still impure if they contain the majority of the oven, is not discussing a small oven, but rather is teaching that <b>the remains of a large</b> oven remain impure if they contain <b>the majority of</b> the oven. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t the Rabbis say</b> in the mishna that any remaining piece of a large oven measuring <b>four</b> handbreadths remains impure? The Gemara answers: That is <b>not difficult. That</b> statement of the Rabbis that the remains of a large oven remain impure if they contain the majority of the oven is referring <b>to an oven</b> measuring <b>nine</b> handbreadths. <b>That</b> statement of the Rabbis that any remaining piece of a large oven measuring four handbreadths remains impure is referring <b>to an oven</b> measuring <b>seven</b> handbreadths.
§The Gemara returns to discuss the mishna in tractate <i>Kelim</i> (28:8) previously mentioned in the Gemara (123a–b): In the case of a ritually impure garment that one begins to tear, once the majority of the garment is torn, the two sections are no longer considered to have a connection, and the garment is pure. Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi Yosei, that even if the majority of the garment is torn, if a part of the garment the measure of a scarf is left intact, the garment remains impure. <b>Some say another version</b> of Rav Huna’s statement: <b>Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei:</b> If the majority of the garment is torn, the garment is rendered pure <b>even</b> if one <b>left</b> an untorn piece <b>the measure of a scarf.</b>
With regard to that statement of Rav Huna, <b>Reish Lakish said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the garment is pure even if one left an untorn piece the measure of a scarf <b>only</b> with regard to a torn <b>garment. But</b> with regard to <b>a hide,</b> if the majority was torn and a piece the measure of a scarf remains, the piece is considered <b>significant</b> and the hide remains impure. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> with regard to a torn <b>hide,</b> if a piece the size of a scarf remains it is <b>not</b> considered <b>significant</b> and the hide is therefore rendered pure.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from that which is taught in the mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 26:9): With regard to <b>a hide</b> that is <b>impure</b> with impurity imparted by <b>treading,</b> if the owner <b>intended with regard to</b> the hide <b>to</b> fashion it into <b>straps and sandals,</b> then <b>when he applies a scalpel to</b> the hide, the hide becomes <b>pure;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say:</b> The hide does not become pure <b>until he reduces</b> the hide to a measure of less <b>than five handbreadths.</b>
<b>In any event, when one reduces</b> the hide to a measure of less than five handbreadths, everyone agrees that it becomes <b>pure. Why</b> is this so? <b>Let us say</b> that the hide is considered <b>significant</b> and therefore remains impure. Reish Lakish answered: <b>Here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where one needs</b> the cut hide <b>for a seat</b> that he wishes to designate for <b>a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>].</b> Since a piece of hide measuring less than five handbreadths cannot be used for a seat, it is not considered significant in such a case.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a hide</b> of an unslaughtered carcass <b>upon which there is an olive-bulk of flesh, one who touches a strand</b> of flesh <b>emerging from</b> the flesh <b>or a hair</b> that is on the side of the hide <b>opposite</b> the flesh <b>is ritually impure.</b> Although he did not touch an olive-bulk of the flesh, he is rendered impure with the impurity of an unslaughtered carcass. The reason is that the strand of flesh has the same status as the flesh itself, and the hair is considered protection to the flesh, which also has the same status as the flesh with regard to one who touches it.
If <b>upon</b> the hide <b>there were two half olive-bulks,</b> the hide <b>imparts the impurity</b> of an unslaughtered carcass <b>by means of carrying,</b> because one moves them together, <b>but not by means of contact</b> with the flesh, because one touches them separately; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The hide does not impart impurity, <b>neither by means of contact nor by means of carrying. And Rabbi Akiva concedes in</b> the case of <b>two half olive-bulks where one skewered them with a wood chip and moved them that he is impure. And for what</b> reason <b>does Rabbi Akiva deem</b> one <b>ritually pure</b> in a case where he moved both half olive-bulks with <b>the hide,</b> as in that case, too, he moved them together? <b>It is because the hide</b> separates between them and <b>nullifies them.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that in the case of a hide of an unslaughtered carcass upon which there is an olive-bulk of flesh, the flesh is not nullified by the hide, and therefore one who touches a strand of flesh emerging from the flesh is ritually impure. With regard to this section of the mishna, <b>Ulla said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case where <b>an animal severed</b> the piece of flesh, e.g., a dog bite. <b>But</b> if a person used <b>a knife</b> to <b>sever</b> the flesh, the flesh <b>is nullified</b> by the hide because the person nullified the flesh via his action.
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Ulla: Did Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> with regard to a large piece of flesh the size of <b>a <i>tarta</i>,</b> i.e., a quarter of a <i>kav</i>? Ulla <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rav Naḥman was surprised and asked: <b>And</b> did he say it <b>even</b> with regard to a piece of flesh the size of <b>a sifter?</b> Ulla <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rav Naḥman swore and <b>said to him: By God!</b> Even <b>if Rabbi Yoḥanan had said</b> this statement <b>to me</b> directly <b>from his mouth, I would not have listened to him.</b>
<b>When Rav Oshaya ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael <b>he found Rabbi Ami,</b> and <b>he said this <i>halakha</i> before him: This is what Ulla said and this is what Rav Naḥman responded to him.</b> Rav Oshaya <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ami: <b>And</b> just <b>because Rav Naḥman is the son-in-law of the family of the <i>Nasi</i>, can he demean the halakhic statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b>
Another <b>time</b> Rav Oshaya <b>found</b> Rabbi Ami <b>sitting and saying this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If <b>upon</b> the hide <b>there were two half olive-bulks,</b> the hide <b>imparts</b> the <b>impurity</b> of an unslaughtered carcass <b>by means of carrying but not by means of contact</b> with the flesh, because he touches them separately and moves them together; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It imparts impurity <b>neither by means of contact nor by means of carrying.</b>
With regard to this section of the mishna, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion that the hide imparts the impurity of an unslaughtered carcass by means of carrying <b>only</b> in a case where <b>an animal severed</b> the half olive-bulks of flesh from the animal. <b>But</b> if a person used <b>a knife</b> to <b>sever</b> the half olive-bulks of flesh, the flesh <b>is nullified.</b> If Rav Naḥman had heard that the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan was stated with regard to a case of half olive-bulks of flesh, he would not have been surprised that this <i>halakha</i> also applies to pieces of flesh that amount together to the size of a <i>tarta</i> or a sifter.
Rav Oshaya <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ami: <b>Does the Master teach</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna but not with regard to the first section of the mishna that discusses the case of a complete olive-bulk of flesh? Rabbi Ami <b>said to him: Yes. But did Ulla say to you</b> this halakhic statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan in Babylonia <b>with regard to the first clause</b> of the mishna? Rav Oshaya <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rabbi Ami <b>said to him:</b> If so, Rav Naḥman was justified in his surprise at the <i>halakha</i> of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>By God,</b> even <b>if Joshua, son of Nun, had said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>to me in his name,</b> i.e., from his own mouth, <b>I would not have listened to him.</b>
<b>When Ravin and all those descending</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>came</b> to Babylonia, <b>they stated</b> this <i>halakha</i> of Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>with regard to the first clause</b> of the mishna. The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the matter is <b>difficult.</b> If an olive-bulk of flesh is nullified by being severed with a knife, the same should be true for larger measurements, such as a <i>tarta</i>, which is unreasonable, as people would not usually disregard such a large amount. The Gemara resolves this difficulty <b>in accordance with that which Rav Pappa said</b> with regard to a different matter:

Daf 124b

The reference is <b>to a thin</b> layer of flesh attached to the hide. <b>Here, too,</b> the Gemara concludes that Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement is referring <b>to a thin</b> layer of flesh attached to the hide. When a person severs such a piece of flesh along with the hide, even if the total volume of the flesh is an olive-bulk, or even a much larger measure, it is insignificant and is nullified by the hide.
§The mishna teaches: If <b>upon</b> the hide <b>there were</b> two half olive-bulks, the hide imparts the impurity of an unslaughtered carcass by means of carrying but not by means of contact with the flesh; this is the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.
<b>Bar Padda says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that Rabbi Yishmael holds that that hide does not impart impurity by means of contact <b>only</b> with regard to one who touched the hide <b>on the outside. But</b> if one directly touched the pieces of flesh <b>inside</b> the hide, even though he did not touch any one piece measuring an olive-bulk, he is impure. This is because <b>there is</b> a principle that if one <b>touches</b> an impure item measuring less than an olive-bulk <b>and again touches</b> another impure item measuring less than an olive-bulk, he becomes impure, as the two instances of contact join together to constitute contact with the requisite measure of an olive-bulk.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: There is no</b> such principle that if one <b>touches</b> an impure item <b>and again touches</b> another impure item that the two instances of contact join together to constitute contact with the requisite measure of an olive-bulk. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas said the same thing,</b> i.e., maintained the same principle.
The statement of <b>Rabbi Yishmael is that which we said:</b> Two instances of contact do not join together to constitute contact with the requisite measure of impurity. The statement of <b>Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas is</b> that <b>which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:1): With regard to <b>any</b> part of a corpse that <b>imparts impurity in a tent,</b> i.e., that imparts impurity to any other item that is under the same roof, if that body part was <b>divided</b> into two pieces, each measuring less than an olive-bulk, but together they constitute an olive-bulk, <b>and one placed</b> both pieces <b>inside the house,Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas</b> rules that the two pieces do not join together to constitute the requisite measure of an olive-bulk. Therefore, he <b>deems</b> everything inside the house <b>pure. And the Rabbis</b> rule that the two pieces of the corpse join together to constitute an olive-bulk, and therefore they <b>deem</b> everything inside the house <b>impure.</b>
<b>Didn’t Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas say</b> in that mishna <b>there</b> that <b>there is no</b> such principle that a tent <b>overlies</b> an impure item <b>and again overlies</b> another impure item such that the two instances join together to constitute the requisite measure for impurity imparted in a tent? <b>Here, too,</b> Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas would agree with Rabbi Yishmael that <b>there is no</b> such principle that if one <b>touches</b> an impure item <b>and again touches</b> another impure item that the two instances join together to constitute contact with the requisite measure of an olive-bulk.
The Gemara objects to the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Since</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> so too, the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas must be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who disagrees with Rabbi Yishmael. <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Akiva</b> rule more leniently than Rabbi Yishmael, as he <b>deems</b> one <b>pure</b> in both cases of contact and carrying, whereas the Rabbis rule more stringently than Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas and deem everything in the house impure?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Akiva deems</b> one who touches or carries the pieces of flesh <b>pure only</b> because they are nullified <b>by the hide. But in general</b> he holds that items join together to <b>impart impurity, as the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches: And Rabbi Akiva concedes in</b> the case of <b>two half olive-bulks where one skewered them with a wood chip and moved them that he is impure. And for what</b> reason <b>does Rabbi Akiva deem one ritually pure in</b> a case where he moved both half olive-bulks with <b>the hide?</b> It is <b>because the hide</b> separates between them and <b>nullifies them.</b>
<b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama raises an objection</b> to the statement of bar Padda that Rabbi Yishmael maintains that two instances of contact with two pieces measuring less than an olive-bulk join together to constitute contact with the requisite measure of an olive-bulk. His objection is based on that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: “And by these you shall become impure; whoever touches <b>their carcass</b> shall be impure until evening. And whoever carries the carcass of them shall wash his clothes and be impure until evening” (Leviticus 11:24–25). It is derived from the term “their carcass” that one who touches the carcass itself becomes impure, <b>but</b> one who touches <b>a hide that has upon it two half olive-bulks</b> of flesh does <b>not</b> become impure.
One <b>might</b> have thought that a hide that has upon it two half olive-bulks of flesh does not impart impurity <b>even by means of carrying.</b> Therefore, the continuation of <b>the verse states: “And whoever carries</b> the carcass of them <b>shall</b> wash his clothes and <b>be impure</b> until evening,” from which it is derived that one who carries a carcass, even by means of the hide, becomes impure; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The verse juxtaposes <b>“whoever touches”</b> with <b>“and whoever carries,”</b> indicating that <b>that which enters the category of</b> impurity via <b>contact, enters the category of</b> impurity via <b>carrying; that which does not enter the category of</b> impurity via <b>contact, does not enter the category of</b> impurity via <b>carrying.</b>
Based on this <i>baraita</i>, one can object to the statement of bar Padda: <b>And if it is so</b> that Rabbi Yishmael maintains that two instances of contact with two pieces of flesh measuring less than an olive-bulk join together to constitute contact with the requisite measure of an olive-bulk, then the case of a hide that has upon it two half olive-bulks of flesh also <b>enters the category of</b> impurity transmitted by means of <b>contact</b> when one directly touches the flesh <b>inside</b> the hide. Therefore, why does Rabbi Akiva disagree with Rabbi Yishmael by stating that in this case there is no transmission of impurity by means of carrying because there is no transmission of impurity by means of contact?
<b>Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Akiva <b>is saying: That which enters the category of</b> impurity via <b>contact in every manner,</b> even by touching the hide on the outside, <b>enters the category of</b> impurity via <b>carrying; that which does not enter the category of</b> impurity via <b>contact in every manner, does not enter the category of</b> impurity via <b>carrying.</b>
§The Gemara continues to discuss the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. <b>Rav Avya the Elder asked Rabba bar Rav Huna:</b> The mishna below teaches that with regard to <b>a sealed thigh bone</b> of an unslaughtered carcass and of a creeping animal, where the bone is intact to the extent that there is no access to the marrow, which contains marrow inside but no flesh outside, one who touches it remains ritually pure because it does not enter the category of impurity via contact. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> as to whether it <b>imparts impurity</b> via carrying?
Perhaps <b>Rabbi Yishmael maintains</b> the principle: <b>That which enters the category of</b> impurity via <b>contact, enters the category of</b> impurity via <b>carrying; that which does not enter the category of</b> impurity via <b>contact, does not enter the category of</b> impurity via <b>carrying. And</b> therefore, <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> cited above, <b>this is the reason</b> that Rabbi Yishmael taught that one who carries a hide that has upon it two half olive-bulks of flesh becomes impure even though it does not enter the category of impurity via contact if one touched the outside of the hide: It is <b>because it enters the category of</b> impurity via <b>contact</b> if one directly touched the flesh <b>inside</b> the hide. Therefore, a sealed thigh bone, which does not enter the category of impurity via contact in any manner, does not enter the category of impurity via carrying either.
<b>Or perhaps</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>does not maintain</b> this principle, and he would maintain that one who carries a hide that has upon it two half olive-bulks of flesh becomes impure even if it were not the case that it enters the category of impurity via contact if one directly touched the flesh inside the hide. And therefore, Rabbi Yishmael holds that a sealed thigh bone imparts impurity via carrying even though it does not enter the category of impurity via contact in any manner.
In an effort to evade the question, Rabba bar Rav Huna distracted Rav Avya the Elder and <b>said to him:</b> Look, <b>a raven flies</b> in the sky.
<b>Rava, son of</b> Rabba bar Rav Huna, <b>said to</b> his father: <b>But isn’t this Rav Avya the Elder of Pumbedita, whom the Master would praise to us,</b> saying <b>that he is a great man?</b> If so, why did you treat him in that manner and evade his question? Rabba bar Rav Huna <b>said to him: Today I am</b> in a state best described by the verse: <b>“Let me lean against the stout trunks;</b> let me couch among the apple trees” (Song of Songs 2:5), meaning: I am tired, <b>and he asked me</b> about <b>a matter that requires reasoning</b> and careful examination, and therefore I could not provide an immediate answer.
§<b>Ulla says:</b> With regard to <b>two half olive-bulks that one skewered with a wood chip, even</b> if one <b>moves them back and forth the entire day,</b> he does not contract impurity via carrying, and <b>he is pure.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason?</b> With regard to impurity transmitted by carrying <b>it is written:</b> “And one who carries [<i>vahannosei</i>] its carcass shall wash his clothes and be impure until evening” (Leviticus 11:40). The words “and who carries” in the term “and one who carries” is <b>written</b> <i>vav</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>sin</i>, <i>alef</i>, which can be read <b><i>venisa</i>,</b> meaning: Is carried; <b>but</b> according to the traditional vocalization <b>we read</b> the word as <b><i>nosei</i>,</b> meaning: Carries. From here it is derived that with regard to impurity transmitted by carrying <b>we require</b> that one <b>carry [<i>nosei</i>]</b> the requisite measure of impurity of a carcass, i.e., an olive-bulk, <b>and that</b> that olive-bulk <b>be capable of being carried [<i>nissa</i>] all at once,</b> without the assistance of a utensil. This requirement is not met with regard to two half olive-bulks that one skewered with a wood chip, which are carried only with the assistance of a utensil.
The Gemara objects to Ulla’s statement: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that if <b>upon</b> the hide <b>there were two half olive-bulks,</b> the hide <b>imparts the impurity</b> of an unslaughtered carcass <b>by means of carrying but not by means of contact</b> with the flesh; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Why</b> does it impart impurity by means of carrying? <b>This</b> case <b>does not</b> fulfill the requirement that an olive-bulk of impure flesh <b>be capable of being carried</b> all at once without the assistance of a utensil, as the hide is needed to carry them.
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The mishna is discussing a case <b>where a thin</b> layer of flesh was attached to the hide. Despite the fact that there is not one piece of flesh the size of an olive-bulk, the two half olive-bulks are connected by a strip of thin flesh which enables the two pieces to be carried at once without the assistance of the hide. Therefore, the pieces impart impurity by means of carrying but not by means of contact.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a refutation to the opinion of Ulla from that which is stated in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Akiva concedes in</b> the case of <b>two half olive-bulks where one skewered them with a wood chip and moved them that he is impure. Why? This</b> case <b>does not</b> fulfill the requirement that an olive-bulk of impure flesh <b>be capable of being carried</b> all at once without the assistance of a utensil. The Gemara rejects this refutation: <b>Here too,</b> with regard to the statement of Rabbi Akiva, the mishna is discussing a case <b>of a thin</b> layer of flesh connecting the two pieces.
The Gemara suggests: The opinion of Ulla is <b>like</b> one side of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to two pieces of flesh, neither of which measures an olive-bulk, both <b>one who touches and one who moves</b> the pieces is impure. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even one who carries</b> the pieces is impure. The Gemara asks: What is added by the statement of Rabbi Eliezer? <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>carrying is not</b> the same as <b>moving?</b>
<b>Rather, isn’t this</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> Both <b>one who touches and one who moves</b> pieces of flesh is impure even if an olive-bulk of flesh <b>is not capable of being carried</b> without the assistance of a utensil? <b>And Rabbi Eliezer comes to say:</b> One becomes impure only if an olive-bulk of flesh <b>is capable of being carried</b> without the assistance of a utensil. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the intention of Rabbi Eliezer’s statement is to qualify the statement of the Rabbis, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the word <b>even?</b> Rather, <b>say</b> the statement of Rabbi Eliezer differently: One is impure only if an olive-bulk of flesh <b>is capable of being carried</b> without the assistance of a utensil.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>the thigh bone of</b> a human <b>corpse,</b>

Daf 125a

<b>and the thigh bone of a sacrificial</b> animal that was rendered unfit as <i>piggul</i>, i.e., an offering that was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its designated time, or <i>notar</i>, i.e., part of an offering left over after the time allotted for its consumption, <b>whether</b> these thigh bones were <b>sealed</b> and there was no access to the marrow, or <b>whether</b> they were <b>perforated</b> and there was access to the marrow, <b>one who touches them is ritually impure.</b> The reason is that a piece of bone of a corpse the size of a barley grain imparts impurity, and the bone of a sacrificial animal that was disqualified in this manner imparts impurity by rabbinic decree via contact.
With regard to <b>the thigh bone of an unslaughtered carcass and the thigh bone of a creeping animal, one who touches them</b> when they are <b>sealed</b> remains <b>ritually pure.</b> If one of these thigh bones was <b>perforated at all, it imparts impurity via contact,</b> as in that case contact with the bone is tantamount to contact with the marrow. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that even with regard to</b> impurity transmitted via <b>carrying</b> there is a distinction between sealed and perforated thigh bones? It is derived from a verse, as <b>the verse states: “One who touches</b> the carcass thereof shall be impure until the evening; <b>and one who carries</b> the carcass thereof shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39–40), indicating: <b>That which enters the category of</b> impurity via <b>contact, enters the category of</b> impurity via <b>carrying; that which does not enter the category of</b> impurity via <b>contact, does not enter the category of</b> impurity via <b>carrying.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who touches the thigh bone of a human corpse is ritually impure, whether or not it was sealed. The Gemara infers that with regard to one who <b>touches</b> the bone, <b>yes,</b> he is impure, <b>but</b> one who <b>overlies</b> the thigh bone is <b>not</b> impure, as it does not transmit impurity to that which is above it or under the same roof.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If there is an olive-bulk of flesh</b> attached to the bone then <b>it should transmit impurity in a tent,</b> i.e., to that which is under the same roof, <b>as well.</b> The Gemara answers: The mishna is discussing a case <b>where there is not an olive-bulk of flesh</b> attached to the bone.
The Gemara objects: <b>But if there is an olive-bulk of marrow inside</b> the bone, <b>the impurity breaks through</b> the bone, so to speak, <b>and ascends</b> beyond it. Therefore, <b>it should transmit impurity in a tent as well.</b> The Gemara explains: The mishna is discussing a case <b>where there is not an olive-bulk of marrow inside</b> the bone.
The Gemara objects: <b>But if</b> the mishna maintains that <b>marrow inside</b> the bone of a living person <b>heals</b> the flesh <b>outside</b> the bone, then since the marrow could replenish itself and catalyze the growth of flesh on the bone <b>it is a proper limb.</b> Therefore, as is the case with any piece of a proper limb, even one less than the size of an olive-bulk, <b>it should transmit impurity in a tent as well. Rav Yehuda, son of Rabbi Ḥiyya, says: That is to say</b> that the mishna maintains that <b>marrow inside</b> the bone <b>does not heal</b> the flesh <b>outside</b> the bone.
The Gemara asks: <b>To what</b> case <b>did you interpret</b> the mishna to be referring? It is a case <b>where there is not an olive-bulk</b> of marrow. <b>If so, in</b> the case of <b>a sacrificial animal, why does</b> the thigh bone <b>impart impurity?</b> The Sages issued a decree that the bones of a sacrificial animal that are attached to flesh or contain marrow that became <i>piggul</i> or <i>notar</i> render those who touch them impure, as they serve as handles or protection for the flesh or marrow. By contrast, in this case there can be no <i>piggul</i> or <i>notar</i> because there is less than an olive-bulk of flesh or marrow.
<b>And furthermore,</b> if the mishna is discussing a case where there is not an olive-bulk of marrow, <b>why do the thigh bone of an unslaughtered carcass and the thigh bone of a creeping animal impart impurity</b> in a case <b>when they were perforated?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> is <b>not difficult. The first clause</b> of the mishna, which discusses the thigh bone of a corpse, is referring to a case <b>where there is not an olive-bulk</b> of marrow. <b>The latter clause</b> of the mishna, which discusses the thigh bones of a sacrificial animal, an unslaughtered carcass, and a creeping animal, is referring to a case <b>where there is an olive-bulk</b> of marrow. <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>what is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaching us? He is teaching us several</b> distinct <b>matters</b> separately, as follows.
In <b>the first clause he is teaching us that the marrow inside</b> the bone <b>does not heal</b> the flesh <b>outside</b> the bone. With regard to the thigh bone of <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>what is he teaching us?</b> He is teaching us that a bone that <b>serves</b> as a handle or protection for flesh or marrow that became <b><i>notar</i> is significant</b> and imparts impurity, <b>as Mari bar Avuh said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Bones of sacrificial</b> animals <b>that served</b> as a handle for <b><i>notar</i>,</b> meaning that they have leftover meat on them or inside them after the allotted time for its consumption, <b>transmit impurity to the hands</b> of those who handle them, just as the leftover sacrificial meat itself transmits impurity to the hands. <b>Since</b> the bones <b>have become a base for</b> an intrinsically <b>forbidden object,</b> they are treated in the same manner as the forbidden object itself.
Next, the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna teaches that with regard to the thigh bone of <b>an unslaughtered carcass, even if there is an olive-bulk</b> of marrow inside, if it <b>was perforated</b> it <b>does</b> impart impurity, but if it <b>was not perforated,</b> it does <b>not</b> impart impurity.
<b>Abaye said: Actually,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna maintains that <b>marrow inside</b> the bone <b>heals</b> the flesh <b>outside</b> the bone. <b>And</b> with regard to the consequent assertion: If so, the thigh bone should impart impurity in a tent as well, the explanation is that <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where one scraped</b> the bone. Therefore, the flesh and the marrow can no longer heal, and the bone is not considered a proper limb that imparts impurity in a tent.
<b>And</b> this mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as Rabbi Elazar said: A thigh bone that one scraped lengthwise is impure</b> like a limb. Even if it is not attached to flesh or marrow, a bone scraped in such a manner still has the ability to heal. But if one scraped it <b>widthwise</b> it will not heal and is therefore <b>pure. And your mnemonic</b> to remember which can heal and which cannot is <b>a palm tree,</b> because if one sawed a strip off of a palm tree lengthwise it can heal, but if one did so widthwise, i.e., one sawed a strip off of the circumference of the tree, the flow of sap is disrupted and the tree cannot heal.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Actually,</b> the mishna is discussing a case <b>where there is an olive-bulk</b> of marrow in the bone. <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna also holds that <b>marrow inside</b> the bone <b>heals</b> the flesh <b>outside</b> the bone. And as for the consequent assertion: If so, the bone should transmit impurity in a tent, in fact the bone does impart impurity in a tent. <b>And</b> to <b>what</b> is the mishna referring <b>when it teaches</b> that one who <b>touches</b> the bone is ritually impure? It is also referring to one who <b>overlies</b> the bone.
The Gemara asks: <b>But if the marrow inside</b> the bone <b>heals</b> the flesh <b>outside</b> the bone, <b>why</b> does the mishna teach that <b>the thigh bone of a carcass and the thigh bone of a creeping animal are pure when they were not perforated?</b>
<b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Giddel said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where there is an olive-bulk of marrow that</b> has become detached and <b>is rattling</b> inside the bone. <b>With regard to</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse, the impurity breaks through</b> the bone <b>and ascends,</b> and it therefore transmits impurity in a tent. But with regard to the impurity of <b>a carcass, since</b> the marrow <b>is</b> loose and <b>rattling,</b> it will not heal. Therefore, if the bone <b>was perforated</b> and it is possible to touch the marrow, the bone <b>does</b> impart impurity. But if the bone <b>was not perforated</b> it does <b>not</b> impart impurity.
According to Rabbi Yoḥanan, overlying is referred to as touching in the mishna. <b>Rabbi Avin said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Avin</b> who said: <b>We learn</b> in a mishna <b>as well</b> (<i>Oholot</i> 3:1): In the case of <b>one who touches</b> with one hand <b>half an olive-bulk</b> of a corpse <b>and</b> simultaneously his other hand <b>overlies half an olive-bulk or half an olive-bulk</b> of flesh from a corpse <b>overlies him, he is impure.</b>
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that impurity via contact and impurity transmitted in a tent or to one overlying a part of the corpse are <b>one concept,</b> it <b>is due to that</b> reason that the half olive-bulk of impurity that he touched and the half olive-bulk of impurity that he overlaid <b>join together</b> to constitute the requisite measure of an olive-bulk.
<b>But if you say</b> that <b>they are two concepts,</b> how <b>can they join together? But didn’t we learn</b> in that mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:1): <b>This is the principle: Any</b> impure items lacking the requisite volume to have impure status on their own <b>that are of one concept join together and are impure;</b> if they are <b>of two concepts,</b> they do not join together and remain <b>pure?</b>Apparently, touching and overlying a corpse create the same type of impurity, and therefore overlying is referred to as touching in the mishna here.
The Gemara challenges: <b>Rather, what</b> is the alternative? <b>Is it one concept</b> that comprises both touching and overlying? <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna in tractate <i>Oholot</i>: <b>But</b>

Daf 125b

in the case of <b>one who touches half an olive-bulk</b> of flesh from a corpse <b>and</b> simultaneously <b>another item overlies</b> both <b>him and half an olive-bulk</b> of flesh from a corpse, he remains <b>pure.</b>
<b>But if</b> impurity via contact and via a tent are considered <b>one concept, why</b> does he remain <b>pure? Rather,</b> based on the latter clause of the mishna, <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is <b>difficult,</b> because it indicates that these two categories of impurity are considered one concept and join together to constitute the requisite measure for impurity.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> In the first clause of the mishna <b>we are dealing with</b> a case where the source of <b>impurity is pressed between two</b> wooden <b>chests and there is no opening of</b> one <b>handbreadth in between</b> the chests. When the hand of a person overlies the chests, the impurity of the pressed item rises beyond the chests and it transmits impurity to the person. Therefore, his interaction with <b>all</b> the sources <b>of</b> impurity is considered <b>as</b> though he <b>is touching</b> them simultaneously. Consequently, there is no proof in the mishna for the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan that imparting impurity via contact and via a tent are considered the same concept.
Therefore, the Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i> who refers to</b> impurity imparted in <b>a tent</b> as one who <b>touches [<i>noge’a</i>]?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is Rabbi Yosei, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Oholot</i> 4:1): <b>Rabbi Yosei says: A full ladle [<i>tarvad</i>] of dust</b> from a corpse <b>imparts impurity</b> like the corpse itself in three ways: <b>By contact [<i>bemagga</i>], and by carrying, and in a tent.</b>
<b>Granted,</b> the dust of a corpse imparts impurity <b>via carrying and in a tent; this</b> one who carries it <b>carries the entire</b> amount of dust <b>and that</b> one who overlies the dust <b>overlies all of it. But</b> with regard to one who <b>touches</b> it, <b>one does not touch all of</b> the dust, and it should therefore be impossible for one to become impure via contact. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i>: To <b>what</b> is the term <b><i>noge’a</i></b> referring? It is referring to one who <b>overlies</b> the dust.
The Gemara asks: How is it possible to explain the <i>baraita</i> in such a manner? <b>But doesn’t</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>teach</b> the case of one who <b>touches</b> separately, <b>and doesn’t he teach</b> the case of one who <b>overlies</b> separately? Therefore, the term <i>noge’a</i> cannot be referring to overlying. <b>Abaye said:</b> That is not difficult because there are two types of overlying. With regard to a tent that overlies impurity at a height of <b>below</b> one <b>handbreadth,</b> that <b>tent</b> is referred to as <b>touching.</b> But a tent that overlies impurity at a height of <b>above</b> one <b>handbreadth</b> is referred to as <b>merely a tent.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> According to Rabbi Yosei, <b>even a tent</b> that overlies impurity at a height <b>above</b> one <b>handbreadth is</b> referred to as <b>touching. And what are the circumstances of</b> a tent that is referred to as <b>merely a tent</b> and not as touching? The term tent is referring to the case of a structure that overlies both a person and a source of impurity, thereby <b>spreading</b> the impurity from its source to the person.
<b>Rava said: From where do I say</b> my opinion? It is <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Oholot</i> 9:4) that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> With regard to <b>bundles</b> that serve as <b>a bed and grilles</b> taken from <b>windows,</b> if one placed them between the ground floor and the upper floor of the house such that they serve as a ceiling, since they have become part of the building they are not susceptible to impurity. Therefore, even if there are holes in the bundles and the grilles, <b>they serve as a barrier between the house and the upper floor such that the impurity</b> of a corpse present in the area of the house <b>cannot enter the other side,</b> i.e., the upper floor.
And if <b>one spread out</b> the bundles and grilles outside the house in an impermanent manner by hanging them <b>over a corpse in the air</b> like a net, <b>one who touches,</b> i.e., overlies the corpse, <b>opposite a hole</b> in the netting becomes <b>impure.</b> By contrast, one who overlies it <b>not opposite a hole</b> remains <b>pure.</b>
Rava explains his proof: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that he spread out the netting <b>below</b> the height of one <b>handbreadth</b> above the corpse, <b>why</b> does one who overlies the corpse <b>not opposite a hole</b> in the netting remain <b>pure?</b> In such a case, the netting is close enough to the corpse to be considered part of the clothing of the corpse. Therefore, the case is tantamount to one where the <b>corpse is</b> dressed <b>in its clothing, and a corpse</b> dressed <b>in its clothing imparts impurity</b> to one who overlies it because the clothing does not act as a barrier.
<b>Rather, is it not</b> the case that he spread out the netting more than one <b>handbreadth above</b> the corpse? <b>And</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>refers to</b> overlying the corpse <b>as touching.</b> Apparently, contrary to the opinion of Abaye, Rabbi Yosei refers to overlying as touching even when the overlying item is more than one handbreadth above the source of impurity.
<b>Abaye</b> rejected Rava’s proof and <b>said: Actually,</b> the case is one where one spread the netting out <b>below</b> the height of one <b>handbreadth</b> above the corpse. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which you say:</b> If so, one who overlies the corpse not opposite a hole in the netting should also become impure as it <b>is</b> tantamount to a case of <b>a corpse</b> dressed <b>in its clothing,</b> this case is not similar to the case of a corpse dressed in its clothing. In the case of <b>a corpse</b> dressed <b>in its clothing</b> the clothing does not act as a barrier to the impurity because the one who dressed the corpse <b>nullified</b> the clothing by rendering its status as though it is a part of the corpse. But in <b>this</b> case in the <i>baraita</i>, the one who spread out the netting over the corpse intended to remove the bundles and grilles afterward and <b>he did not nullify</b> them.
The Gemara objects with regard to Abaye’s explanation: <b>But</b> if the case is one where he spread out the netting less than one handbreadth above the corpse, even if it is not considered the clothing of the corpse, <b>let it be</b> considered <b>like</b> a source of <b>impurity hidden</b> underneath an overlying structure at a distance of less than one handbreadth. In such a case, the impurity <b>breaks through and ascends,</b> and therefore it should transmit impurity even to one who overlies it not opposite a hole in the netting. The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b>hidden impurity does not break through</b> and ascend.
<b>And from where do you say</b> that this is the opinion of Rabbi Yosei? It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 4:2): In the case of <b>a compartment</b> in <b>a chest</b> that is inside a house, in which the <b>open space</b> of the compartment itself <b>has</b> at least one cubic <b>handbreadth</b> in volume, <b>but</b> the <b>opening</b> of the compartment to the house does <b>not have</b> the area of one square <b>handbreadth,</b> and the volume of the entire chest is forty <i>se’a</i>, in that case, if there is a source of <b>impurity inside</b> the compartment, the compartment does not act as a barrier and <b>the house is impure.</b> If the source of <b>impurity is inside the house</b> but outside the chest, <b>whatever is inside</b> the compartment remains <b>pure,</b> because the opening of the compartment is less than one handbreadth.
This differentiation exists <b>because it is typical for</b> a source of <b>impurity to exit</b> from its location, and therefore impurity can be transmitted out of the compartment and into the house. <b>But it is not typical for</b> a source of <b>impurity to enter</b> a location, and therefore an impure item that lies in the house does not transmit impurity into the compartment. Since the volume of the chest is forty <i>se’a</i> it constitutes a separate tent, and the compartment that is part of the chest is also considered part of this tent.
<b>And Rabbi Yosei deems</b> the house <b>pure</b> when the impure item is in the compartment. The item will not necessarily impart impurity outside of the compartment <b>because one can remove</b> the source of impurity from the compartment <b>in halves,</b> i.e., in pieces that each measure less than the requisite amount to impart impurity. <b>Or,</b> alternatively, one can <b>burn</b> the source of impurity while it still remains <b>in its place</b> inside the compartment.
<b>And the latter clause</b> of that mishna <b>teaches:</b> If one <b>placed</b> the chest <b>in the entrance</b> to the house <b>and the opening of</b> the compartment is facing <b>out</b> of the house, if there is a source of <b>impurity inside</b> the chest, <b>the house</b> remains <b>pure</b> because the impure item will typically exit the house. If there is a source of <b>impurity in the house, whatever is inside</b> the chest remains <b>pure,</b> because the source of impurity will not enter the chest.

Daf 126a

<b>And it is taught with regard to</b> that <i>halakha</i> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei deems</b> it <b>pure. To which</b> <i>halakha</i> in the mishna is this referring? <b>If we say</b> that it is referring <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which discusses a chest placed in the entrance of the house, <b>the first <i>tanna</i> also deems</b> it <b>pure</b> in that case.
<b>Rather,</b> it is clear <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> says</b> that if a source of <b>impurity</b> is <b>inside</b> the compartment of a chest that is inside the house, <b>the house is impure, either because it is typical for</b> a source of <b>impurity to exit</b> its location, <b>or because</b> he holds that <b>a hidden</b> source of <b>impurity breaks through</b> and ascends. <b>And Rabbi Yosei</b> disagrees and <b>says to him:</b> With regard to <b>that which you say</b> that <b>it is typical for</b> a source of <b>impurity to exit</b> its location, it is not necessarily so. <b>One can remove</b> the impure item <b>in halves or burn it in its place</b> inside the compartment. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which you say</b> that <b>a hidden</b> source of <b>impurity breaks through</b> and ascends, <b>a hidden</b> source of <b>impurity does not break through.</b> Consequently, Rabbi Yosei must hold that a hidden source of impurity does not break through and ascend.
§Based on the previous statement of Rabbi Yosei, the Gemara established that Rabbi Yosei holds that a hidden source of impurity does not break through and ascend. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between that previous statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 11:7): In the case of <b>a dog that ate the flesh of a corpse, and the dog</b> then <b>died and is lying on the threshold</b> in such a manner that its neck and mouth are facing toward the inside of the house, <b>Rabbi Meir says: If there is an opening</b> the size of one cubic <b>handbreadth inside the neck of</b> the dog, i.e., the neck itself constitutes this measure, the dog <b>imports impurity</b> into the house because the upper portion of the dog’s body overlies the impure item inside the dog and the impurity is transmitted through the neck and mouth of the dog into the house. <b>But if</b> there is <b>not</b> such a large cavity in the neck of the dog, then there is no <i>halakha</i> of a tent, and the dog <b>does not import the impurity</b> into the house.
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: One looks</b> to determine exactly where on the threshold the dog is located. If the impure item inside the dog is located anywhere <b>from opposite,</b> i.e., under, <b>the lintel and toward the inside</b> of the house, <b>the house is impure.</b> If the dog is located anywhere <b>from opposite the lintel and toward the outside</b> of the house, <b>the house</b> remains <b>pure.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> One must determine the exact manner in which the dog is lying on the threshold. If <b>its mouth</b> is located <b>inside</b> the house, but its rear is located outside the house, <b>the house</b> remains <b>pure.</b> If <b>its mouth</b> is located <b>outside</b> the house but its rear is located inside the house, <b>the house is impure.</b> This is <b>because</b> the source of <b>impurity exits</b> the dog’s body <b>through its edge,</b> i.e., its rear.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: In</b> both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, i.e., whether the dog is lying such that its mouth is inside the house or outside the house, <b>the house is impure.</b> The reason is that the impure item can exit through either the mouth or the rear.
The Gemara analyzes the statement of Rabbi Yosei that if the dog is located anywhere from under the lintel and toward the inside of the house, the house is impure. <b>What, is</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yosei not referring to</b> a case where <b>there is not an opening</b> the size of one cubic <b>handbreadth inside</b> the dog’s <b>neck,</b> with regard to which Rabbi Meir says that the house remains pure? Accordingly, Rabbi Yosei is responding to Rabbi Meir and saying: Even if the neck of the dog is not the size of one cubic handbreadth, as long as the impure item inside the dog is located from under the lintel and toward the house, the house is impure because it overlies the impure item.
<b>And</b> therefore <b>learn from it</b> that Rabbi Yosei holds that <b>a hidden</b> source of <b>impurity breaks through</b> and ascends, contrary to Rabbi Yosei’s opinion as understood from his previous statement.
<b>Rava said:</b> Rabbi Yosei holds that a hidden source of impurity does not break through and ascend. As for that which Rabbi Yosei teaches: One looks whether the impure item inside the dog is located opposite the lintel and toward the inside of the house, Rabbi Yosei actually <b>teaches: One looks at the empty space</b> adjacent to <b>the</b> source of <b>impurity. And Rabbi Yosei disagrees</b> with Rabbi Meir <b>with regard to two</b> matters, <b>and says to Rabbi Meir:</b> As for <b>that which you say</b> that if <b>there is the width of</b> one cubic <b>handbreadth in the neck</b> of the dog, <b>it imports the impurity</b> into the house, that is not so. Rather, <b>we follow</b> the measure of <b>the empty space,</b> i.e., the neck of the dog imports impurity into the house only if it contains a cubic handbreadth of space in addition to the thickness of the flesh of the neck itself.
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which you say</b> that even if the dog is located on the outer portion of the threshold of the house, <b>the entire house is impure,</b> that is not so. Rather, if the impurity inside the dog is located anywhere <b>from opposite the lintel and toward the inside</b> of the house, <b>the house is impure.</b> If the impurity inside the dog is located anywhere <b>from opposite the lintel and toward the outside</b> of the house, <b>the house</b> remains <b>pure.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches</b> that Rava’s explanation is <b>explicit</b> in the mishna itself, as follows: <b>Rabbi Yosei says: One looks at the empty space</b> adjacent to the source <b>of impurity.</b>
§Previously the Gemara established that Rabbi Yosei holds that with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity, overlying is referred to as touching, as the transmission of impurity via contact and via overlying are considered one category. But the mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:1) cited earlier (125b) states that in the case of one who touches half an olive-bulk of flesh of a corpse, if a tent simultaneously overlies him and another half an olive-bulk of flesh he remains pure. Evidently, there is a <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with Rabbi Yosei and holds that these two methods of transmitting impurity are not the same category. The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with</b> Rabbi Yosei? The Gemara answers: <b>It is Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b>

Daf 126b

Parts of a corpse that impart impurity include an olive-bulk of flesh, a complete limb, the majority of a corpse’s bones, and the majority of the essential bones of its skeleton, namely, its legs, spine, and ribs. All of these impart impurity via contact, carrying, and in a tent. There are also <b>three</b> sources of <b>impurity</b> that <b>derive from a corpse, each one</b> of which imparts impurity in <b>two</b> ways <b>but</b> does <b>not</b> impart impurity in a <b>third</b> way. <b>And they are the following: A full ladle of dust</b> from a corpse, <b>and a bone</b> the size of <b>a barley grain, and a grave cover [<i>golel</i>] and a grave wall [<i>dofek</i>]</b> upon which the cover rests.
<b>A full ladle of dust imparts impurity via carrying and in a tent, but it does not impart impurity via contact,</b> as it is impossible for one to touch all of the particles of dust simultaneously. <b>And where</b> among these sources of impurity is the imparting of impurity via <b>contact</b> applicable? It is applicable <b>with one of those</b> other two sources of impurity, i.e., a bone the size of a barley grain and the cover or wall of a grave.
<b>A bone</b> the size of <b>a barley grain imparts impurity via carrying and contact, but it does not impart impurity in a tent.</b> This <i>halakha</i> was transmitted to Moses from Sinai. <b>And where</b> among these sources of impurity is impurity imparted in <b>a tent?</b> It is <b>with one of those</b> other two sources of impurity.
<b>A grave cover and a grave wall impart impurity via contact and in a tent, but they do not impart impurity via carrying.</b> This <i>halakha</i> too was transmitted to Moses from Sinai. <b>And where</b> among these sources of impurity is impurity transmitted via <b>carrying?</b> It is <b>with one of those</b> other two sources of impurity. It may be inferred from Rabbi Shimon’s statement that a full ladle of dust imparts impurity in a tent but not via contact that he disagrees with Rabbi Yosei and holds that overlying is not the same category as touching.
§The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>the thigh bone of an unslaughtered carcass and the thigh bone of a creeping animal,</b> one who touches them when they are sealed remains ritually pure, because the bone itself does not impart impurity. With regard to this topic, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “One who touches the carcass thereof shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The word <b>“carcass”</b> indicates that one who touches the carcass is impure, <b>but</b> one who touches <b>a sealed thigh bone is not.</b>
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> one who touches <b>a perforated</b> thigh bone remains pure. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “One who touches</b> the carcass thereof [<i>benivlatah</i>] <b>shall be impure,”</b> indicating that one who touches a part of the animal through <b>which it is possible to touch</b> the flesh, which has the halakhic status of an unslaughtered carcass [<i>neveila</i>], is <b>impure, but</b> one who touches a part of the animal through <b>which it is impossible to touch</b> the flesh remains <b>pure.</b> Therefore, one who touches a protective layer such as the outside of a sealed thigh bone does not become impure, as it is impossible to touch the marrow.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Abaye: If that is so,</b> that one who touches the protective layer of a carcass via which it is impossible to touch the flesh of the carcass itself does not become impure, <b>an animal</b> still <b>in its hide should not impart impurity,</b> as one can touch the hide, which constitutes a protective layer, but not the flesh. Abaye answered: <b>Go out</b> and <b>see how many orifices there are in</b> the body of an animal via which one can touch the flesh, e.g., the eyes, the nostrils, and the mouth.
Similarly, <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: If that is so,</b> that one who touches the protective layer of a carcass via which it is impossible to touch the flesh of the carcass itself does not become impure, <b>the kidney</b> of a carcass that is completely covered <b>in its fat should not impart impurity</b> via contact. Rava answered: <b>Come</b> and <b>see how many sinews emerge from</b> the kidney that one is able to touch.
§The mishna taught that the <i>halakha</i> distinguishes between a sealed and a perforated thigh bone of a carcass or a creeping animal. With regard to this topic, <b>Rav Oshaya raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>one intended to perforate</b> the thigh bone <b>but did not</b> yet <b>perforate it?</b> This is the dilemma: Is a thigh bone <b>lacking perforation considered to be lacking</b> the necessary <b>action</b> for it to impart impurity, and it therefore retains its status as a sealed thigh bone, <b>or not?</b>
Rabbi Oshaya <b>then resolves</b> the dilemma: A thigh bone <b>lacking perforation is not considered to be lacking</b> the necessary <b>action</b> for it to impart impurity. If one intends to perforate it, it imparts impurity immediately.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The egg of a creeping animal in which tissue</b> of an embryo <b>developed</b> and one who comes into contact with the egg are <b>ritually pure,</b> as the impure creeping animal is hermetically sealed. But if <b>one perforated</b> the egg with a hole of <b>any size,</b> one who comes in contact with the egg is <b>ritually impure.</b> In the case of <b>a mouse that</b> grows from the ground and <b>is half-flesh half-earth, one who touches the</b> half that is <b>flesh is impure;</b> one who touches <b>the</b> half that is <b>earth is pure. Rabbi Yehuda says: Even one who touches the</b> half that is <b>earth where it is adjacent to the flesh is ritually impure.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that in the case of an egg of a creeping animal in which tissue of an embryo developed, if it is perforated then one who touches it is ritually impure. With regard to this matter <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “These are the impure ones to you among all that creep; whoever touches them when they are dead shall be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 11:31). The term <b>“the impure ones”</b> is interpreted as <b>including the egg of a creeping animal and the thigh bone of a creeping animal</b> in the category of sources of impurity.
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> an egg <b>in which tissue</b> of an embryo <b>has not developed</b> imparts impurity. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “That creep,”</b> indicating that <b>just as a creeping animal has developed tissue, so too</b> only <b>the egg of a creeping animal in which tissue</b> of an embryo <b>has developed</b> imparts impurity.
One <b>might</b> have thought that in the case of an egg in which tissue of an embryo has developed, it imparts impurity <b>even</b> if it <b>was not perforated.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Whoever touches</b> them when they are dead <b>shall be impure,”</b> indicating that <b>when it is possible to touch</b> the flesh, contact renders one <b>impure; but when it is impossible to touch</b> the flesh, one remains <b>pure.</b>
<b>And how</b> large must <b>its perforation</b> be to render one touching the egg or thigh bone impure? Its width must be the size of <b>a strand of hair, as it is possible</b> for one <b>to touch</b> the inside of an egg or thigh bone <b>with a strand of</b> his <b>hair.</b>
§The mishna teaches: In the case of <b>a mouse that</b> grows from the ground and <b>is half-</b>flesh half-earth, one who touches the half that is flesh is impure. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says</b> in this regard: One becomes impure in such a case <b>only</b> if the flesh of the mouse has <b>developed along the entire</b> length of the mouse, from head to foot. <b>Some teach</b> the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even one who touches</b> the half that is <b>earth where it is adjacent to the flesh is ritually impure. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> One becomes impure in such a case <b>only</b> if the flesh of the mouse has <b>developed along the entire</b> length of the mouse.
<b>The one who teaches</b> the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>with regard to the first clause</b> of the mishna, <b>all the more so</b> he teaches this same <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna. <b>But the one who teaches</b> the statement of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna holds that it applies only to that clause, with regard to one who touches the half that is earth where it is adjacent to the flesh according to Rabbi Yehuda. <b>But</b> according to the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>, stated in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, <b>even if</b> the flesh of the mouse <b>has not developed</b> along the entire length of the mouse, one who touches the half of the mouse that is flesh is impure.
§<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the following verse: “And these are they which are impure to you among the creeping animals that creep upon the earth: The weasel, and the mouse, and the great lizard after its kinds” (Leviticus 11:29). <b>Since “mouse” is stated</b> among the creeping animals that impart impurity, <b>I</b> would <b>derive</b> that <b>even a sea mouse,</b> i.e., a sea creature that has an appearance similar to a mouse, imparts impurity <b>because its name is</b> also <b>mouse. But</b> ostensibly, the opposite conclusion could be derived through <b>logical inference:</b> The verse <b>deems a weasel impure and deems a mouse impure.</b> Therefore, <b>just as a weasel is a species that grows on land, so too</b> the <b>mouse</b> to which the verse is referring is <b>a species that grows on land;</b> a sea mouse does not impart impurity.
<b>Or,</b> perhaps <b>go this way:</b> The verse <b>deems a weasel impure and deems a mouse impure;</b> accordingly, <b>just as “weasel”</b> is referring to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose name is weasel, so too, “mouse”</b> is referring to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose name is mouse, even a sea mouse, as its name is</b> also <b>mouse.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Upon the earth,”</b> indicating that a land mouse imparts impurity, but a sea mouse does not.
<b>If</b> this <i>halakha</i> is derived only from the phrase <b>“upon the earth,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the verse means that any mouse, whether a land mouse or a sea mouse, <b>imparts impurity</b> when it is <b>upon the earth,</b> but if <b>it descended to the sea it does not impart impurity.</b>

Daf 127a

Therefore, <b>the verse states: “That creep,”</b> indicating that creeping animals impart impurity <b>anywhere that</b> they <b>creep,</b> including the sea, as these animals can float in the sea. Consequently, the phrase “upon the earth” is understood as indicating that a sea mouse does not impart impurity.
The <i>baraita</i> raises an alternative interpretation: <b>Or</b> perhaps the term <b>“that creep [<i>hashoretz</i>]”</b> should <b>not</b> be interpreted in this manner, as it <b>could rather</b> be interpreted to mean that <b>any</b> creeping animal <b>that breeds [<i>hammashritz</i>] imparts impurity,</b> but a creeping animal <b>that does not breed does not impart impurity. I shall</b> therefore <b>exclude a mouse that is half</b>-<b>flesh half-earth,</b> i.e., that generates spontaneously from the earth, <b>as it does not breed</b> and therefore does not impart impurity.
<b>But</b> ostensibly, the <i>halakha</i> of a mouse that is half-flesh half-earth is subject to <b>logical inference:</b> Since the verse <b>deems a weasel impure and deems a mouse impure,</b> then <b>just as “weasel”</b> is referring to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose name is weasel, so too, “mouse”</b> is referring to <b>any</b> animal <b>whose name is mouse, even a mouse that is half-flesh half-earth.</b>
<b>Or</b> perhaps <b>go this way:</b> One might think that <b>just as a weasel breeds, so too, “mouse”</b> is referring to a mouse that <b>breeds,</b> excluding one that generates from the earth, which does not impart impurity. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And these are they which are impure to you <b>among the creeping animals</b> that creep upon the earth.” The term “among the creeping animals” is interpreted as including a spontaneously generated mouse. Therefore, the term “that creep” is interpreted as indicating that creeping animals impart impurity on land and in the sea, and the phrase “upon the earth” teaches that a sea mouse is not included in the category of mouse and does not impart impurity.
<b>One of the Sages said to Rava: Say</b> the interpretation of the verse differently. The term <b>“among the creeping animals”</b> serves <b>to include a mouse that is half-flesh half-earth</b> among those that impart impurity. The term <b>“that creep”</b> teaches that <b>any</b> animal <b>that creeps</b> imparts impurity, <b>and even a sea mouse. And if</b> one should reject this interpretation <b>due to</b> the phrase <b>“upon the earth,”</b> which seems to indicate that a sea mouse does not impart impurity, that phrase teaches that a creeping animal <b>imparts impurity</b> only when it is <b>on land,</b> but if it <b>descended to the sea</b> it <b>does not impart impurity.</b>
Rava <b>said to him:</b> Your suggestion is not logical. According to your opinion, a sea mouse, which is in the sea, imparts impurity. <b>And since you consider the sea a location of impurity,</b> it is impossible to suggest that a mouse does not impart impurity when it is located in the sea. Since both land and sea are places of impurity, <b>what</b> difference does it make <b>for me</b> if the mouse is located <b>here</b> on land, and <b>what</b> difference does it make <b>for me</b> if it is located <b>there</b> in the sea?
The Gemara asks: How can the <i>baraita</i> interpret the phrase “upon the earth” as teaching that a sea mouse does not impart impurity? Isn’t <b>this</b> phrase: <b>“Upon the earth,” necessary to exclude</b> a case of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>a floating</b> source of <b>impurity?</b> If a person is uncertain whether he touched a source of impurity that is floating in the water, he remains pure even if the incident took place in a private domain, where a case of uncertain impurity is generally deemed impure. <b>As Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi said:</b> The phrase <b>“upon the earth”</b> is written <b>to exclude</b> a case of <b>uncertainty</b> involving <b>a floating</b> source of <b>impurity.</b>
The Gemara answers: The phrase <b>“upon the earth” is written two</b> times in the passage. One instance is written to exclude a case of uncertainty involving a source of impurity that is floating, and the other instance teaches that a sea mouse does not impart impurity.
§With regard to the topic of the eight creeping animals mentioned in the Torah, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“The great lizard after its kinds”</b> (Leviticus 11:29) <b>includes</b> in the category of creeping animals <b>the <i>arvad</i>,</b> a type of snake, <b>and also</b> the creeping animals called <b><i>nefilim</i> and salamander [<i>salamandera</i>].</b>
Apropos the salamander, which was thought to generate from fire, the <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>When Rabbi Akiva would reach this verse</b> in Leviticus, he would <b>say</b> in exclamation: <b>“How great are Your works, O Lord”</b> (Psalms 104:24). <b>You have creatures</b> that <b>grow in the sea and you have creatures</b> that <b>grow on land. If those in the sea would ascend to the land they would immediately die. If those that are on land would descend to the sea they would immediately die.</b>
Similarly, <b>you have creatures</b> that <b>grow in the fire and you have creatures</b> that <b>grow in the air. If those in the fire would ascend to the air they would immediately die. If those in the air would descend to the fire they would immediately die.</b> Therefore, <b>“how great are Your works, O Lord.”</b>
§The Gemara continues to discuss creatures living in a particular environment. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Kilayim</i> 5:10): For <b>every</b> animal <b>that exists on land there is</b> an equivalent animal <b>in the sea, except for the weasel,</b> which exists only on land. <b>Rabbi Zeira said: What is the verse</b> from which it is derived? It is written: <b>“Listen all you inhabitants of the world [<i>ḥeled</i>]”</b> (Psalms 49:2). Dry land is called <i>ḥeled</i> because it is the sole habitat for the weasel [<i>ḥulda</i>].
In continuation of the discussion of creatures living in a particular environment, <b>Rav Huna the son of Rav Yehoshua said: The beavers</b> of the region <b>of Neresh are not from the settled area,</b> because they live only in the water and not on dry land. Consequently, one who eats their meat is not liable to receive lashes for violating the prohibition: “And every creeping animal that creeps upon the earth is a detestable thing; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 11:41).
§Apropos the region surrounding Neresh, <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The people of the city of <b>Neresh</b> shall be placed <b>under excommunication,</b> as they are all wicked, including <b>its fat, its hide, and its tail,</b> i.e., all types of people, both old and young. The Gemara continues to discuss Neresh. The verse states: <b>“Oh land, land, land hear the word of the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 22:29). <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This verse is appropriate with regard to the inhabitants of Neresh, as <b>Neresh does not want to listen to the word of the Lord.</b>
Furthermore, <b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If <b>a resident of Neresh kisses you, count your teeth</b> to make sure he did not steal one. And if <b>a resident of</b> the city of <b>Nehar Pekod accompanies you</b> on a journey, it is <b>because of the beautiful jacket that he sees on you</b> and wants to steal from you. If <b>a resident of Pumbedita accompanies you</b> on a journey, <b>change your lodging place</b> because there is a concern that he will rob you.
§The Gemara returns to discussing different types of creatures. <b>Rav Huna bar Torta said: Once I went to</b> the city of <b>Va’ad and I saw</b> that the locals were in the practice of placing <b>a snake wrapped around a great lizard</b> in order to breed the two. <b>After a period of time, an <i>arvad</i>,</b> a snake that bites and kills people, <b>emerged from between them.</b>
<b>And when I came before Rabbi Shimon the Righteous, he</b> explained why this crossbreeding created an <i>arvad</i> and <b>said to me: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said:</b> These residents of Va’ad <b>caused the emergence of a creature that I did not create in My world</b> by crossbreeding a snake and a great lizard; <b>so too, I will bring upon them</b> a punishment, the hazard of this uniquely dangerous <b>creature that I did not create in My world,</b> i.e., an <i>arvad</i>.
The Gemara objects: <b>But didn’t the Master say: All</b> different animals <b>whose</b> method of <b>procreation and</b> period of <b>gestation are the same</b> are able to <b>reproduce and raise offspring together. But all</b> animals <b>whose</b> method of <b>procreation and</b> period of <b>gestation are not the same cannot reproduce and raise offspring together.</b> And the gestation period for a great lizard and a snake are not equal.
<b>Rav says:</b> It was <b>a miracle within a miracle</b> that they were able to reproduce and a new creature was born. The Gemara asks: Why is <b>this</b> considered a miracle? <b>It was a calamity</b> because an <i>arvad</i> was born. The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>a miracle within a miracle?</b> It was a miraculous <b>calamity</b> for the wicked people, to punish them for their actions.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The limb</b> of an animal, with flesh, sinews, and bones, <b>and the flesh</b> of an animal, <b>that were</b> partially severed and remain <b>hanging from the animal</b> do not have the halakhic status of a limb severed from a living animal, which imparts impurity like an unslaughtered carcass, or of flesh severed from a living animal, which is ritually pure, respectively. If one had intent to eat the limb or the flesh, the limb or flesh becomes impure if it comes in contact with a source of impurity, and they <b>impart impurity as food</b> to other foods and liquids, although they remain <b>in their place</b> attached to the animal. <b>But</b> in order for them to become impure, <b>they need</b> to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity through contact with one of the seven liquids that facilitate susceptibility.

Daf 127b

If <b>the animal was slaughtered,</b> although this act of slaughter does not render it permitted for consumption by a Jew (see 73b), the limb and the flesh <b>were</b> thereby <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity by coming in contact <b>with the blood of</b> the slaughtered animal, as blood is one of the seven liquids; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says: They were not rendered susceptible</b> to impurity through the animal’s own blood; they are rendered susceptible only once they have been wet with another liquid.
If <b>the animal died</b> without slaughter, <b>the</b> hanging <b>flesh needs</b> to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity in order to become impure, as its halakhic status is that of flesh severed from a living animal, which is ritually pure and does not have the status of an unslaughtered carcass. <b>The</b> hanging <b>limb imparts impurity as a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> animal <b>but does not impart impurity as the limb of</b> an unslaughtered <b>carcass;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And Rabbi Shimon deems</b> the limb <b>ritually pure.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that the limb of an animal that was partially severed and remains hanging from the animal imparts impurity as food if one had intent to eat it. The Gemara infers: It imparts <b>impurity as food, yes,</b> but it does <b>not</b> impart <b>the impurity of a carcass,</b> which can be transmitted to people and utensils in addition to food.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> the limb <b>can heal</b> and reattach to the animal’s body then <b>it should not be susceptible even to impurity as food. And if it cannot heal, it should impart the impurity of a carcass as well.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the limb <b>will not heal, and</b> the reason that the limb does not impart impurity of a carcass is that <b>the impurity of a carcass is different</b> and unique, <b>as the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the impurity of a carcass: “And <b>if</b> any of their carcass <b>fall</b> upon any sowing seed” (Leviticus 11:37), indicating that the severed limb of an animal is not considered a carcass <b>until it</b> completely <b>falls</b> from the animal.
<b>This</b> explanation <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the limb and the flesh</b> of an animal <b>that</b> were partially severed and remain <b>hanging from the animal and are connected</b> to the animal <b>by</b> a connector the size of <b>a strand of hair,</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they impart the impurity of a carcass.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if any of the carcass <b>fall,”</b> indicating that a severed limb does not impart the impurity of a carcass <b>until it</b> completely <b>falls</b> from the animal. <b>And nevertheless,</b> despite the fact that it is not considered severed with regard to the impurity of a carcass, such a limb is considered severed with regard to <b>being susceptible to impurity as food.</b>
This explanation <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi, as Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> With regard to <b>figs that dried</b> while still attached to <b>their tree,</b> despite the fact that they are still attached, they are considered as if they have been picked and <b>are susceptible to impurity as food. But</b> with regard to <b>one who picks them on Shabbat</b> they are considered attached, and <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin offering.</b> Just as a partially severed limb of an animal is considered both attached and severed with regard to different <i>halakhot</i>, so too this dried fruit is considered both attached and detached with regard to different <i>halakhot</i>.
<b>Let us say</b> that a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Okatzin</i> 2:11) <b>supports</b> the opinion of Shmuel, who holds that dried figs still attached to the tree are considered as if they are detached with regard to susceptibility to impurity as food: <b>Vegetables that dried</b> while they are attached to <b>their plant, such as cabbage and gourd,</b> which become hard as wood and inedible when dried, <b>are not susceptible to impurity as food.</b> But if <b>one cut them</b> when they were still moist <b>and</b> then <b>dried them</b> in order to use them for fuel, or, in the case of gourds, to make utensils out of them, <b>they are susceptible to impurity as food.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Does it enter your mind</b> that if <b>one cut them and dried them</b> they are susceptible to impurity as food? Such a vegetable <b>is merely wood,</b> and it is inedible. <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where</b> one cut the vegetables when they were still moist <b>in order to dry them.</b> The novelty of the <i>baraita</i> is that even though one intends to dry the vegetables and render them inedible, as long as they are still moist they are susceptible to impurity as food.
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i> in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>that it is</b> discussing <b>cabbage and gourd: Since one dried them, they are inedible</b> and consequently are not susceptible to impurity as food. <b>But other</b> types of <b>produce,</b> which are edible when dried, <b>are susceptible to impurity.</b>
The Gemara explains the suggested support to Shmuel: <b>What are the circumstances? If one dried</b> both the produce <b>itself and its stems,</b> isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the produce is no longer considered attached to the plant and is susceptible to impurity? If so, it would be unnecessary for the <i>baraita</i> to teach this. <b>Rather, isn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> discussing a case where one dried the produce <b>without</b> drying <b>its stems?</b> Accordingly, in such a case the produce is considered detached with regard to impurity even though it is considered attached with regard to Shabbat, in accordance with the statement of Shmuel.
The Gemara rejects this interpretation: The <i>baraita</i> is not necessarily discussing that case. <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case where both the produce <b>itself and its stems</b> were dried. <b>And</b> although it appears that the <i>halakha</i> is obvious in such a case, <b>it was necessary for</b> the <i>baraita</i> to mention it in order to teach the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>: In a case where one <b>cut</b> the cabbage and gourd when they were still moist <b>in order to dry them,</b> they are susceptible to impurity as long as they are still moist.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a challenge to the opinion of Shmuel from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a tree from which a branch broke off, and</b> the branch <b>has fruit</b> attached to it, even if the fruit is still moist <b>it is considered detached</b> from the tree. But if the branch did not break off, and the fruit <b>dried</b> on the tree, <b>it is considered attached. What, isn’t</b> the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> that <b>just as</b> in the first clause the fruit on the detached branch is considered <b>detached with regard to all matters,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of both Shabbat and impurity, <b>so too</b> in the latter clause the fruit that dried on the tree is considered <b>attached</b> to the tree <b>with regard to all matters,</b> even the transmission of impurity, contrary to the opinion of Shmuel?
The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>Are the cases comparable? This</b> case is <b>as it is, and that</b> case is <b>as it is.</b> In the first clause of the <i>baraita</i>, the fruit on the detached branch is considered detached with regard to all matters. In the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>, the dried fruit on the tree is considered attached with regard to Shabbat but detached with regard to impurity.
§The mishna teaches: If <b>the animal was slaughtered,</b> Rabbi Meir holds that with the blood of the slaughtered animal the limb and the flesh were rendered susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Shimon says that they were not rendered susceptible with the animal’s own blood. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon <b>disagree?</b>
<b>Rabba said:</b> The mishna is discussing a case where the blood of the slaughtered animal came into contact with the body of the animal but not with the partially severed limb. The <i>tanna’im</i> agree that if an appendage that constitutes a handle is rendered susceptible to impurity, the food to which it is attached is also rendered susceptible. But <b>they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>an animal constitutes a handle for</b> its <b>limb.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>an animal does not constitute a handle for</b> its <b>limb,</b> and therefore the limb is not rendered susceptible to contract impurity along with the body of the animal. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>an animal constitutes a handle for</b> its <b>limb,</b> and therefore the limb is rendered susceptible along with the body of the animal.
<b>Abaye said</b> a different explanation of the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon: The mishna is discussing a case where the blood of the slaughtered animal came into contact with the body of the animal but not with the partially severed limb, and both <i>tanna’im</i> agree that an animal does not constitute a handle for its limb. But they also agree that if the liquid comes into contact with only part of the food it renders the entire item susceptible to impurity. Therefore, if the partially severed limb is considered part of the animal it is rendered susceptible to impurity along with the animal. Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether the limb is considered part of the animal, and generally speaking, with regard to any case where a small part of an item is hanging off the larger part such that if one <b>grasps</b> and lifts the <b>small</b> part the <b>large</b> part <b>does not ascend with it.</b>
One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that although if one <b>grasps</b> and lifts the <b>small</b> part the <b>large</b> part <b>does not ascend with it,</b> the small part <b>is</b> still considered one and <b>the same</b> with the large part. Therefore, a partially severed limb is rendered susceptible to impurity along with the body of the animal. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that the small part <b>is not</b> considered one and <b>the same</b> with the large part in such a case, and therefore the partially severed limb is not rendered susceptible to impurity along with the body of the animal.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds</b> in accordance with the explanation of Abaye that the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the status of a small part of an item that is hanging off the larger part such that one <b>grasps</b> the <b>small</b> part <b>and</b> the <b>large</b> part <b>does not ascend with it.</b>
<b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a contradiction</b> between one statement <b>of Rabbi Meir and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Meir: Did Rabbi Meir</b> actually <b>say</b> that even in a case where one <b>grasps</b> the <b>small</b> part of an item <b>and</b> the <b>large part does not ascend with it,</b> the small part <b>is</b> still considered one and <b>the same</b> with the large part?
One can <b>raise a contradiction</b> to this statement from a mishna (<i>Tevul Yom</i> 3:1): With regard to a piece of <b>food that was sliced</b> from a larger piece of food <b>and</b> remains <b>partially connected</b> to the larger piece, the entire item is considered one and the same with regard to impurity. If one who was previously ritually impure and immersed that day and is waiting for nightfall for the purification process to be completed touched either piece of the item, the entire item becomes impure.

Daf 128a

<b>Rabbi Meir says: If</b> when one <b>grasps the small</b> piece, the <b>large</b> piece <b>ascends with it,</b> it <b>is</b> considered one and <b>the same; but if</b> it does <b>not</b> ascend with it, it <b>is not</b> considered one and <b>the same.</b> This statement of Rabbi Meir is not in accordance with his statement in the mishna that a partially severed limb is part of the body of the animal and is rendered susceptible to impurity along with the body even if one lifts the partially severed limb and the body of the animal does not ascend with it.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> resolves the contradiction and <b>says: The</b> attribution of the <b>opinions</b> in tractate <i>Tevul Yom</i> <b>is reversed.</b> Indeed, Rabbi Meir holds that even if when one lifts the smaller piece, the larger piece does not ascend with it, it is still the same item. Therefore, it is apparent that Rabbi Yoḥanan explains the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon in the mishna in accordance with the explanation of Abaye.
With regard to the contradiction between the two statements of Rabbi Meir, the Gemara asks: <b>What is the difficulty? Perhaps Rabbi Meir distinguishes between</b> the impurity of <b>one who immersed that day and other types of impurity.</b> The impurity of one who immersed that day is a more lenient type of impurity, because he has already immersed and need only wait until the end of the day in order to consume sacrificial offerings. Therefore, there is reason to be more lenient when he touches a partially severed piece of food and to rule that the entire food item does not become impure.
The Gemara answers: One cannot make such a distinction between different types of impurity because it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> With regard to <b>both</b> the impurity of <b>one who immersed that day and other types of impurity,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of contact are the same; whatever is considered contact that transmits impurity with regard to one type of impurity transmits impurity for all types of impurity.
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>does not distinguish</b> between the impurity of one who immersed that day and other types of impurity <b>and Rabbi Meir does distinguish</b> in such a manner. Therefore, there is no contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Meir.
<b>Rabbi Yoshiya said: This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> meant to <b>say: According to the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who does not distinguish between the impurity of one who immersed that day and other types of impurity, there is a contradiction between the two statements of Rabbi Meir, and <b>the</b> attribution of the <b>opinions</b> in the mishna in tractate <i>Tevul Yom</i> <b>is reversed.</b>
<b>Rava said</b> a different explanation of the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon: The mishna is discussing a case where the blood from the slaughter came into contact with the body of the animal but not with the partially severed limb, and both <i>tanna’im</i> agree that an animal constitutes a handle for its limb. <b>They disagree with regard to</b> the principle that <b>there is</b> a status of <b>a handle,</b> i.e., a handle is considered part of the item itself, <b>with regard to</b> transmitting <b>impurity</b> to the attached food, <b>but there is no</b> status of <b>a handle with regard to rendering</b> the attached food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity, as in that regard the handle is considered a separate item.
One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>there is</b> a status of <b>a handle with regard to</b> transmitting <b>impurity, but there is no</b> status of <b>a handle with regard to rendering</b> the attached food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity. Therefore, although the body of the animal constitutes a handle vis-à-vis the limb, it does not render the limb susceptible to impurity. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>there is</b> a status of <b>a handle</b> both <b>with regard to</b> transmitting <b>impurity and with regard to rendering</b> the attached food susceptible to impurity. Therefore, the body of the animal renders the limb susceptible to impurity.
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> a different explanation of the dispute: Both <i>tanna’im</i> hold that a handle renders the attached food susceptible to impurity. Yet, the mishna is discussing a case where the slaughter took place before the owner of the animal designated its meat for the consumption of a gentile. Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether an item can be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity <b>before intention,</b> i.e., before one intends to use it as food. Rabbi Shimon holds that since the animal came in contact with the blood of the slaughter before the owner intended to use it as food, it is not rendered susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Meir holds that the susceptibility to impurity takes effect such that when the owner considers it as food it will be susceptible to impurity.
This dispute is also found in that <b>which we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Okatzin</i> 3:2): <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva would teach this</b> <i>halakha</i>: <b>Fat</b> forbidden in consumption for a Jew from an animal <b>slaughtered in the villages requires intention,</b> i.e., designation, for consumption, for it to become susceptible to impurity. This is because the population in such places is small and there is an abundance of meat, so people do not generally consume the fat. Consequently, unless the Jewish owner intends for a gentile to consume it, it is not considered food. <b>But</b> the fat <b>does not require</b> contact with a liquid in order to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity, <b>as it was already rendered susceptible by the</b> blood of <b>slaughter</b> even though it came into contact with the blood before the Jew designated it for consumption.
Rabbi Yehuda continues: <b>I said before him: You taught us, our teacher,</b> that in a case of <b>endives that one picked and rinsed</b> in water <b>for</b> the consumption of <b>an animal, and</b> one later <b>reconsidered</b> and decided to designate <b>them for human</b> consumption, the endives <b>need</b> to come into contact with liquid <b>a second</b> time in order to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity, as food designated for animal consumption does not contract impurity. Evidently, for a food item to become susceptible to impurity, its contact with liquid must occur after one designated it as food. <b>And Rabbi Akiva</b> then <b>retracted</b> his previous statement and <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
Rav Pappa concludes: Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon disagree in the same manner. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds in accordance with</b> that which Rabbi Akiva taught <b>originally, and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds in accordance with</b> that which Rabbi Akiva taught after his <b>retraction</b> of his original statement.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said</b> another explanation of the dispute: The mishna is discussing a case where the blood of slaughter came into contact with a partially severed limb, and the blood of slaughter is one of the liquids that render food susceptible to impurity. But slaughter is valid only if one cuts the two <i>simanim</i>, the windpipe and the gullet, or the majority of the two <i>simanim</i>, and the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> a case where <b>the blood</b> in question <b>was wiped off between</b> the cutting of the first <b><i>siman</i> and</b> the second <b><i>siman</i>.</b>
One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>slaughter is</b> defined <b>from</b> the <b>beginning to</b> the <b>end</b> of its performance, <b>and this</b> blood that splashed on the limb <b>is</b> considered <b>blood of slaughter. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>slaughter is</b> defined <b>only</b> as <b>the conclusion</b> of its performance, <b>and this</b> blood from the first <i>siman</i> <b>is</b> considered the <b>blood of a wound</b> and does not render the limb susceptible to impurity.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> another explanation of the dispute: The case is where the blood of slaughter came in contact with the partially severed limb, but Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon <b>disagree with regard to</b> the principle that the <b>slaughter</b> itself <b>renders</b> the limb <b>susceptible</b> to impurity, <b>and not</b> the <b>blood</b> of slaughter. Rabbi Shimon holds that the blood of slaughter is not one of the liquids that render food susceptible to impurity. But the slaughter itself renders the meat of the animal susceptible to impurity, because it prepares the meat for consumption. Therefore, since a partially severed limb is not prepared for consumption by the slaughter, as it remains forbidden, the slaughter does not render it susceptible to impurity. Rabbi Meir maintains that the blood of slaughter is one of the liquids that render food susceptible to impurity, and therefore, the limb is rendered susceptible.
§Earlier (127b), Rabba explained that Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon disagree with regard to whether the body of an animal constitutes a handle for its limb. With regard to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who holds that it does constitute a handle, <b>Rabba raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>an animal</b> with a partially severed limb came into contact with a source of impurity <b>during its lifetime?</b> In such a case, where the animal is not susceptible to contract impurity because it is alive but the partially severed limb is susceptible to contract impurity as food, does the animal <b>constitute a handle for</b> its <b>limb</b> and transmit the impurity to the limb? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
The Gemara introduces a similar dilemma. <b>Abaye says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> in the mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 2:9): In the case of an impure <b>cucumber that one planted in</b> an unperforated <b>flowerpot,</b> such that the cucumber is considered detached from the ground and susceptible to impurity as food, <b>and</b> the cucumber <b>grew and went out beyond</b> the edge of <b>the flowerpot</b> such that part of the cucumber is overlying the ground, the entire cucumber is considered attached to the ground and therefore becomes <b>pure.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: What is the nature of</b> the impurity of the cucumber that it <b>is rendered pure</b> in such a case? <b>Rather, the</b> part of the cucumber that is inside the flowerpot and <b>impure</b> remains <b>in its</b> state of <b>impurity, and</b> the part of the cucumber that is outside the flowerpot and <b>pure</b> remains <b>in its</b> state of <b>purity.</b>
Based on this mishna, <b>Abaye raises a dilemma</b> according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if the part of the cucumber outside of the flowerpot comes into contact with a source of impurity? Does the part of the cucumber outside the flowerpot <b>constitute a handle for its counterpart</b> inside the flowerpot and transmit impurity to it to it? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
The Gemara relates another dilemma based on the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one who bows down to a half of a gourd,</b> worshipping it as a divinity, <b>renders</b> that half of the gourd <b>forbidden,</b> i.e., it is prohibited to derive benefit from it, because it was worshipped as an idol. The other half, though, is not forbidden. Based on this ruling, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b>

Daf 128b

According to Rabbi Shimon, an item that is forbidden due to idol worship is not susceptible to impurity as food (see 129a). <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if the forbidden part of the gourd comes into contact with a source of impurity? Does the forbidden part <b>constitute a handle for its</b> permitted <b>counterpart</b> and transmit impurity to it? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
The Gemara discusses a similar dilemma. <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:8): In the case of <b>a branch of a fig</b> tree <b>that was</b> mainly <b>detached</b> from the tree <b>and</b> which remains <b>attached</b> only <b>to the bark of</b> the tree, <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> holds that the figs on the branch are considered as if they are still attached to the tree. Therefore, he <b>deems</b> them <b>not susceptible to impurity. And the Rabbis say: If</b> one is <b>able</b> to reattach the branch to the tree such that the branch can continue <b>to live</b> and produce fruit, then it is considered as if it is attached to the tree and the fruit on it is <b>not susceptible to impurity. But if not,</b> then the fruit is <b>susceptible to impurity.</b>
With regard to this mishna, <b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> According to the Rabbis, who distinguish between a branch that can be reattached and one that cannot, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of a branch that is mainly detached from a tree but can be reattached, and a second branch grows out from that branch, and is mainly detached from it and cannot be reattached? In such a case, the branch that can be reattached to the tree is not susceptible to contracting impurity, but the branch attached to it is. If the branch that is not susceptible to contract impurity comes into contact with a source of impurity, does it <b>constitute a handle for the other</b> branch and transmit impurity to it? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
The Gemara discusses another similar dilemma. <b>Rabbi Zeira says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 13:2): In the case of a large <b>stone that</b> is situated <b>in the corner</b> of a wall shared by two houses, where the stone is visible from inside both houses, if a leprous mark appears in one of the houses on the stone, <b>when one extracts</b> the stone <b>he must extract the entire</b> stone, even the part of the stone that is part of the neighbor’s wall. <b>But when one destroys</b> his house, after a reappearance of the leprous mark, <b>he must destroy</b> only the part of a stone that is in <b>his</b> house, <b>and leaves</b> the part of a stone <b>that belongs to his neighbor.</b>
With regard to this mishna <b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in such a case with regard to the transmission of impurity from the leprous house to the adjacent house? Does half of the stone in the adjacent house <b>constitute a handle for the other</b> half and impart impurity such that one who enters the neighbor’s house becomes impure just as one who enters the leprous house? Or perhaps there is no <i>halakha</i> of a handle with regard to the impurity of a leprous house. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§The mishna teaches: If <b>the animal died,</b> the hanging flesh needs to be rendered susceptible to impurity via contact with a liquid in order to become impure, as its halakhic status is that of flesh severed from a living animal, which is ritually pure and does not have the status of an unslaughtered carcass. The hanging limb imparts impurity as a limb severed from a living animal but does not impart impurity as the limb of an unslaughtered carcass. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the impurity of <b>a limb from a living</b> animal <b>and</b> the impurity of <b>a limb from a carcass?</b>
The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to <b>flesh that separates from the limb of an animal, as flesh that separates from a limb</b> severed <b>from the living does not impart impurity,</b> just like flesh that separates directly from a living animal. By contrast, an olive-bulk of flesh that separates <b>from the limb of a carcass imparts impurity</b> like the flesh of a carcass.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the verse</b> from which it is derived <b>that a limb</b> severed <b>from the living imparts impurity? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to the impurity of a carcass it is written: <b>“And if some animal [<i>min habehema</i>]</b> of which you may eat <b>dies,</b> he who touches its carcass shall be impure until evening” (Leviticus 11:39). The phrase “some animal [<i>min habehema</i>],” which also means: From an animal, is interpreted as indicating that a limb torn from an animal is included in the impurity discussed in the verse.
The Gemara asks: How can Rav interpret this verse in such a manner? <b>This</b> verse <b>is necessary for</b> another <i>halakha</i> <b>that Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said,</b> as <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> In the verse: <b>“And if some animal [<i>min habehema</i>]</b> of which you may eat <b>dies,</b> he who touches its carcass shall be impure until evening,” the phrase “some animal [<i>min habehema</i>]” indicates that <b>some</b> dead <b>animals impart impurity</b> as a carcass, <b>and some</b> dead <b>animals do not impart impurity</b> as a carcass. <b>And which is that</b> animal that does not impart impurity as a carcass? <b>That is an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>] that one slaughtered.</b> Even though slaughter does not render the animal permitted to be eaten, it removes the animal from the category of a carcass with regard to impurity.
The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> if the verse teaches only one of the two <i>halakhot</i>, <b>let the Merciful One write <i>mibehema</i>,</b> in one Hebrew word. <b>What</b> is the verse teaching when it states: <b>“<i>Min habehema</i>,”</b> with two Hebrew words? It is teaching that one should <b>conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> if this verse teaches that a limb from a living animal imparts impurity, one can <b>also</b> derive from it that <b>even flesh</b> from a living animal imparts impurity. The Gemara responds: <b>It should not enter your mind</b> to derive this, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>flesh that separates from a living</b> animal <b>is impure</b> like a carcass. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And if some animal</b> of which you may eat <b>dies.” Just as death does not generate a replacement,</b> i.e., life is not regenerated from the dead, <b>so too any</b> element of an animal <b>that</b> dies and <b>does not generate a replacement</b> assumes the impurity of a carcass. An animal does not replace a severed limb but it does replace severed flesh; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One can derive this <i>halakha</i> from the word <b>“animal”</b> in the verse. <b>Just as an animal</b> contains <b>sinews and bones, so too, any</b> element of an animal that contains <b>sinews and bones</b> imparts impurity. Therefore, a limb, which contains sinews and bones, imparts impurity, but flesh, which does not contain sinews and bones, does not impart impurity. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> One can derive this <i>halakha</i> from the word <b>“animal”</b> in the verse. <b>Just as an animal</b> contains <b>flesh, sinews, and bones, so too, any</b> element of an animal that contains <b>flesh, sinews, and bones</b> imparts impurity.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabbi Akiva?</b> The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them is</b> with regard to the <b>leg joint,</b> which contains sinews and bones but no flesh. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi it does not impart impurity when it separates from a living animal, but according to Rabbi Akiva it does.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> practical difference <b>is there between</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yosei HaGelili? Rav Pappa said:</b> The practical difference <b>between them is</b> with regard to the <b>kidney and</b> the <b>upper lip</b> that separate from a living animal. According to Rabbi Yosei these parts of the animal impart impurity because the animal does not generate a replacement for them; according to Rabbi Akiva they do not impart impurity, because they do not contain bones.
The Gemara states a different <i>halakha</i> where these three <i>tanna’im</i> express the same opinions. <b>So too, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to creeping animals like this case:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>flesh that separates from a creeping animal</b> during its lifetime <b>should be impure</b> like a creeping animal carcass. Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to creeping animal carcasses: “And upon whatever any of them falls <b>when they are dead</b> shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:32). The word “dead” teaches that <b>just as death does not generate a replacement, so too any</b> element of a creeping animal <b>that</b> dies and <b>does not generate a replacement</b> imparts the impurity of a creeping animal carcass, excluding flesh; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One can derive this <i>halakha</i> from the term <b>“creeping animal.” Just as a creeping animal</b> contains <b>sinews and bones, so too any</b> element of a creeping animal that contains <b>sinews and bones</b> imparts impurity. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> One can derive this <i>halakha</i> from the term <b>“creeping animal.” Just as a creeping animal</b> contains <b>flesh, sinews, and bones, so too, any</b> element of a creeping animal that contains <b>flesh, sinews, and bones</b> imparts impurity.
The Gemara comments: The practical difference <b>between</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabbi Akiva is</b> with regard to <b>the leg joint,</b> which contains sinews and bones but no flesh. <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yosei HaGelili? Rav Pappa said:</b> The practical difference <b>between them is</b> with regard to <b>the kidney and the upper lip,</b> which contain no bones and which are not regenerated by the creeping animal.
<b>And it is necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> both with regard to flesh that separates from a living animal and with regard to flesh that separates from a creeping animal. <b>As if</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>had taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> only with regard to <b>an animal,</b> one might have said that <b>this is the reason that</b> flesh that separates <b>from a living</b> animal <b>does not impart impurity:</b> It is <b>because</b> an animal carcass <b>does not impart impurity in</b> the measure of <b>a lentil-bulk,</b> but rather only in the measure of an olive-bulk. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a creeping animal, which imparts impurity</b> even <b>in</b> the measure of <b>a lentil-bulk, say</b> that flesh that separates <b>from</b> it while it is <b>living should impart impurity.</b>
<b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>had taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> only with regard to <b>a creeping animal,</b> one might have said that flesh that separates from a creeping animal does not impart impurity <b>because</b> a creeping animal <b>does not impart impurity via carrying,</b> and therefore flesh that separates from it <b>while it is living does not impart impurity. But</b> with regard to <b>an animal, which imparts impurity via carrying, say</b> that flesh that separates from it <b>while it is living should impart impurity.</b> Therefore, <b>it is necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> in both cases.
§The Gemara continues to discuss flesh that separates from a living animal. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who severs an olive-bulk of flesh from a limb</b> severed <b>from the living,</b> the flesh does not impart the impurity of a carcass but it does impart impurity as food if one designated it as food before it came into contact with a source of impurity. Therefore, if <b>one severed</b> the flesh from the limb <b>and afterward intended it</b> to be used for the consumption of a gentile, the flesh remains <b>pure</b> because at the time he designated the flesh as food it was not in contact with a source of impurity.
But if <b>he intended it</b> to be used for the consumption of a gentile <b>and afterward severed</b> the flesh, the flesh is <b>impure,</b> because it came into contact with a source of impurity, i.e., the limb, after it was designated as food.
One day <b>Rabbi Asi did not go to the study hall. He found Rabbi Zeira,</b> and <b>said to him: What was said</b> today <b>in the study hall?</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: What</b> matter is <b>difficult for you</b> that you think may have been discussed in the study hall? Rabbi Asi <b>said to him:</b> I find difficult that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one intended</b> flesh from a limb that was severed from a living animal to be used for the consumption of a gentile, <b>and afterward he severed</b> the flesh from the limb, the flesh is <b>impure.</b>

Daf 129a

Why should the flesh be impure? Since the source of its impurity is the limb, and the location of the contact between the limb and the flesh is hidden and not visible, <b>it</b> constitutes contact with a source of <b>impurity</b> in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body, <b>and</b> the principle is that contact with a source of <b>impurity</b> in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body <b>does not render</b> an item <b>impure.</b>
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to</b> Rabbi Asi: This matter is <b>difficult for me as well, and I asked Rabbi Abba bar Memel, and he said to me:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who said</b> that contact with a source of <b>impurity</b> in <b>a concealed part</b> of the body <b>renders</b> an item <b>impure.</b>
Rabbi Asi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: <b>But hasn’t</b> Rabbi Abba bar Memel <b>said</b> this answer <b>in my presence many times? And I said to him</b> that this answer does not explain the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>. The reason is that with regard to a concealed part of the body imparting impurity, <b>Rabbi Meir differentiates between</b> a type of <b>impurity that requires</b> an item to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> in order to take effect <b>and</b> a type of <b>impurity that does not require</b> an item to be <b>rendered susceptible.</b> The case in the <i>baraita</i> is one where the flesh was not yet rendered susceptible to impurity when it was severed from the limb, and Rabbi Meir concedes that in such a case impurity should not apply to a concealed part of the body.
<b>Rava</b> was surprised by Rabbi Asi’s statement and <b>said: But what is the difficulty? Perhaps</b> the <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where</b> the flesh <b>was rendered</b> susceptible to impurity before it was severed from the limb.
<b>Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan said to Rava: Why do I</b> need the flesh severed from the limb to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity? Flesh that is upon a limb from a living animal <b>imparts a severe</b> form of <b>impurity due to its original</b> limb, as it is considered part of the limb that was severed from a living animal, which imparts the impurity of a carcass, a severe form of impurity that is transmitted even to people and vessels. Therefore, it is not necessary to render this flesh susceptible to impurity after its separation from the limb, because the <i>halakha</i> is that any food item that will eventually impart a severe form of impurity does not require contact with liquid in order to be rendered susceptible to imparting a lesser form of impurity.
Rava <b>said to</b> Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan: This principle applies only when the more severe and more lenient forms of impurity are both impurities of food. But in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, the flesh needs to be rendered susceptible to impurity after it is severed from the limb, because <b>when it</b> initially <b>served</b> as part of the limb, <b>it performed the role of wood,</b> i.e., it had the status of flesh of the limb, which is necessary to give the limb the status of a limb severed from the living (see 128b), but it was not impure due to its status as food.
§Rava said that if a food item serves a function other than food, the principle that if it will eventually contract a severe form of impurity it does not require contact with liquid in order to be rendered susceptible to a lesser form of impurity does not apply. The Gemara now relates a number of matters that are explained with the same reasoning. <b>Abaye said:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A mass of</b> hardened <b>leaven that one designated for</b> the purpose of <b>sitting</b> upon it, not for consumption, <b>is nullified.</b> The item is no longer considered food and one may possess it in his house during Passover. But the item is now considered a chair, and it is subject to ritual impurity imparted by treading. It therefore is rendered impure if a <i>zav</i> sits on it.
Abaye explained: <b>Its impurity</b> in such a case is clearly <b>not by Torah law</b> but by rabbinic law; <b>as if it enters your mind</b> that it is impure <b>by Torah law,</b> then <b>we have found</b> that <b>food can become susceptible to a severe</b> type of <b>impurity.</b> This cannot be true, because the category of food that requires contact with liquid to be susceptible to impurity is food that will not eventually impart a more severe type of impurity. Based on Rava’s reasoning, the Gemara responds: The seat imparts impurity by Torah law. <b>When</b> the leaven <b>served</b> as a chair it was not considered food, as <b>it performed the role of wood.</b>
Similarly, <b>Abaye said:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An idolatrous offering of food imparts impurity in a tent.</b> Abaye explained: <b>Its impurity is not by Torah law</b> but by rabbinic law; <b>as if it enters your mind</b> that it is impure <b>by Torah law,</b> then <b>we have found</b> that <b>food can become susceptible to a severe</b> type of <b>impurity.</b> The Gemara responds: The idolatrous offering imparts impurity by Torah law. <b>When</b> the food <b>served</b> as an idolatrous offering it was not considered food, as <b>it performed the role of wood.</b>
Similarly, <b>Abaye said:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Foods that are connected</b> to vessels are considered <b>like the vessels.</b> For example, if dough is attached to a kneading bowl and the owner wishes for the dough to remain there, the dough is considered part of the bowl. Therefore, if an olive-bulk of a corpse touches that dough, it becomes impure with the more severe impurity of a vessel, which imparts impurity to people and other vessels. Abaye explained: <b>Their impurity is not by Torah law</b> but by rabbinic law; <b>as if it enters your mind</b> that it is impure <b>by Torah law,</b> then <b>we have found</b> that <b>food can become susceptible to a severe</b> type of <b>impurity.</b> The Gemara responds: Food connected to vessels imparts impurity by Torah law. <b>When</b> the food <b>served</b> as a connection to the vessel it was not considered food, as <b>it performed the role of wood.</b>
Similarly, <b>Rav Pappa said to Rava</b> in explanation of <b>that which is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:3): <b>Fat</b> forbidden in consumption for a Jew from <b>an animal carcass in the villages, requires designation</b> as food in order for it to become susceptible to contract impurity as food, <b>and</b> it must be <b>rendered susceptible</b> via contact with liquid. Rav Pappa explained: Although the forbidden fat that covers the kidney of a carcass imparts the impurity of a carcass, <b>its impurity due to</b> the impurity of the <b>kidney is not by Torah law</b> but by rabbinic law. <b>As if it enters your mind</b> that it is impure <b>by Torah law,</b> then <b>we have found</b> that <b>food can impart a severe</b> type of <b>impurity</b> and subsequently become susceptible to impurity as food.
The Gemara responds: The fat of a carcass imparts impurity by Torah law. <b>When</b> the fat <b>served</b> the kidney as protection and imparted the impurity of a carcass it did not serve as food, as <b>it performed the role of wood.</b>
Similarly, <b>Rav Mattana said:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a house that one roofed with seeds,</b> i.e., vegetation, if those seeds were impure, they are rendered <b>pure</b> when they are used as the roof of the house. The seeds are no longer considered food but rather part of the house. Therefore, if the house becomes leprous, the entire house becomes impure. Rav Mattana explained: <b>Its impurity is not by Torah law</b> but by rabbinic law; <b>as if it enters your mind</b> that it is impure <b>by Torah law,</b> then <b>we have found</b> that <b>seeds can become susceptible to a severe</b> type of <b>impurity.</b> The Gemara responds: The seeds used for the roof of the house impart impurity by Torah law. <b>When</b> the seeds <b>served</b> as the roof of the house they were not considered food, but rather <b>performed the role of wood.</b>
§The mishna teaches with regard to a hanging limb or flesh of a living animal that if the animal died, the hanging flesh needs to be rendered susceptible to impurity, as its halakhic status is that of flesh severed from a living animal, which is ritually pure. Rabbi Meir then states that the hanging limb imparts impurity as a limb severed from a living animal, but not as an unslaughtered carcass. And <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> the limb <b>pure.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, the ruling of Rabbi Shimon is difficult. <b>If death renders</b> a hanging limb one that has <b>fallen off,</b> i.e., if when the animal died of its own accord the hanging limb is considered to have fallen off its body beforehand, the limb <b>should become impure as a limb from a living</b> animal. <b>If death does not render</b> a hanging limb one that has <b>fallen off,</b> the limb <b>should become impure as a limb from a carcass.</b> How is it possible for Rabbi Shimon to deem the limb pure?
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon is not responding to Rabbi Meir’s statement in the final clause of the mishna. Rather, <b>Rabbi Shimon is referring to the first clause</b> of the mishna, which teaches: <b>The limb and the flesh</b> of an animal that were partially severed and remain <b>hanging from the animal impart impurity as food</b> although they remain <b>in their place</b> attached to the animal. <b>But</b> in order for them to become impure, <b>they need</b> to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> through contact with a liquid. <b>And Rabbi Shimon deems</b> them <b>not susceptible to impurity</b> at all.
<b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon? The verse states</b> with regard to impurity as food: <b>“From all food which may be eaten,</b> that on which water comes shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The repetitive phrase “food which may be eaten” indicates that only <b>food that you are able to feed to others,</b> including gentiles, <b>is called food</b> with regard to being susceptible to impurity as food, but <b>food that you are not able to feed</b>

Daf 129b

<b>to others,</b> such as the limb and flesh from a living animal, which are forbidden even to gentiles, <b>is not called food.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira</b> questioned the explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan and <b>said to Rabbi Asi:</b> If Rabbi Shimon is discussing the first clause in the mishna, claiming that a hanging limb or flesh is pure during the lifetime of the animal, the reason for his statement is not necessarily that food that is forbidden to all people is not considered food. <b>Perhaps the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon there</b> is that <b>since</b> the flesh or limb is still <b>attached</b> to the animal, it is considered <b>attached.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Okatzin</i> 3:8): With regard to <b>a branch of a fig</b> tree <b>that was detached</b> from the tree <b>and</b> remains <b>attached</b> only <b>to the bark</b> of the tree, <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the figs on the branch <b>not susceptible to impurity,</b> as they are considered attached to the tree. <b>And the Rabbis say: If</b> it is possible to reattach the branch to the tree and the branch <b>can</b> continue to <b>live</b> and produce fruit, then it is considered attached to the tree, and the fruit <b>is not susceptible to impurity. But if not,</b> the fruit is <b>susceptible to impurity. And we said to you,</b> Rabbi Asi: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda? And you said to us: Since</b> the branch is still <b>attached</b> to the bark of the tree, it is considered <b>attached.</b> Therefore, the same logic applies to the statement of Rabbi Shimon.
Rabbi Asi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: Rabbi Yoḥanan is explaining the reasoning for Rabbi Shimon’s opinion in <b>the middle clause</b> of the mishna, which teaches: If <b>the animal was slaughtered,</b> the limb and the flesh <b>were rendered</b> susceptible to impurity <b>with the blood of</b> the slaughtered animal; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Shimon says: They were not rendered</b> susceptible with the blood of the slaughtered animal.
<b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The reason is that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to impurity as food: <b>“From all food which may be eaten,</b> that on which water comes shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The phrase “food which may be eaten” indicates that only <b>food that you can feed to others,</b> including gentiles, <b>is called food</b> in this regard, but <b>food that you cannot feed to others,</b> such as the limb and flesh from a living animal, <b>is not called food.</b>
Rabbi Zeira questioned this explanation of Rabbi Yoḥanan as well, and said to Rabbi Asi: If it is with regard to Rabbi Shimon’s opinion in the middle clause of the mishna, <b>perhaps the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon in that</b> clause is not that food that is forbidden to all is not called food.
Rather, it is <b>either in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Rava or in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> cited earlier (127b–128a). According to both explanations of Rabbi Shimon’s opinion, the mishna is discussing a case where only the body of the animal, but not the partially severed limb, came into contact with the blood of slaughter. According to Rava, the reason for Rabbi Shimon’s opinion is that the body of the animal serves the partially severed limb as a handle, and he holds that a handle of a food item transmits impurity to the attached food, but a handle that comes into contact with liquid does not render the attached food susceptible to impurity. And according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, Rabbi Shimon holds that if one grasps a small part of a large item such that the large part does not ascend with the small part, the small part is not considered part of the item with regard to impurity (see 127b).
<b>Rather, actually,</b> one must explain the statement of Rabbi Shimon as it was explained originally, that he is referring <b>to the latter clause</b> of the mishna. <b>And</b> he is <b>not</b> referring <b>to</b> the case of a partially severed <b>limb, but rather to</b> the case of partially severed <b>flesh.</b> Therefore, the latter clause of the mishna teaches: If <b>the animal died</b> without slaughter, Rabbi Meir holds that <b>the</b> hanging <b>flesh needs</b> to be <b>rendered susceptible</b> to impurity in order to impart impurity as food, <b>and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> the limb <b>not susceptible to impurity</b> even if it came into contact with liquid.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The reason is that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to impurity as food: <b>“From all food which may be eaten,</b> that on which water comes shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:34). The phrase “food which may be eaten” indicates that only <b>food that you can feed to others,</b> including gentiles, <b>is called food</b> with regard to being susceptible to impurity as food, but <b>food that you cannot feed to others,</b> such as flesh from a living animal, which is forbidden even to gentiles, <b>is not called food.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The limb and the flesh</b> of a person that were partially severed and remain <b>hanging from a person are ritually pure,</b> although there is no potential for healing. If <b>the person died, the</b> hanging <b>flesh is ritually pure,</b> as its halakhic status is that of flesh severed from a living person. <b>The</b> hanging <b>limb imparts impurity as a limb</b> severed <b>from the living and does not impart impurity as a limb from a corpse;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And Rabbi Shimon deems</b> the flesh and the limb <b>ritually pure.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara challenges the opinion of Rabbi Shimon in the latter clause of the mishna: <b>Whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, the ruling of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> is difficult. <b>If death renders</b> a hanging limb <b>fallen off,</b> i.e., if after the person dies the hanging limb is considered to have fallen off his body beforehand, the limb <b>should impart impurity as a limb</b> severed <b>from the living. And if death does not render</b> a hanging limb <b>fallen off,</b> and the limb is considered attached to the body at the time of death, then the limb <b>should impart impurity as a limb from a corpse.</b>
The Gemara explains: This statement of Rabbi Shimon is not referring directly to the case in the mishna. Rather, the statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon is referring</b> to the matter of a limb that separates from a corpse <b>in general.</b> Rabbi Shimon inferred from <b>that which the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>said: The</b> hanging <b>limb imparts impurity as a limb</b> severed <b>from the living and does not impart impurity as a limb from a corpse,</b> that <b>evidently, in general the limb of a corpse imparts impurity. And</b> in reference to this <b>Rabbi Shimon said to him: In general, the limb of a corpse does not impart impurity,</b> if it does not contain an olive-bulk of flesh.
Another pair of <i>tanna’im</i> had the same dispute as Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: I heard that a limb</b> severed <b>from the living imparts impurity. Rabbi Yehoshua said to him:</b> May one infer from this statement that a limb <b>from a living</b> person imparts impurity <b>but</b> a limb <b>from a corpse does not?</b> But it can be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that a limb from a corpse imparts impurity: <b>If</b> with regard to <b>a living</b> person, <b>who is pure</b> and does not impart impurity, nevertheless <b>a limb that separates from him is impure,</b> then with regard to <b>a corpse, which is impure, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that the limb that separates from it is impure?
Furthermore, Rabbi Yehoshua adds that <b>it is written in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>:</b> On <b>Minor Passover,</b> i.e., the fourteenth of Iyyar, <b>one does not eulogize.</b> Should one infer from here <b>that</b> on <b>Major</b> Passover, i.e., the fourteenth of Nisan, it is permitted <b>to eulogize?</b> Clearly that is not the case. <b>Rather,</b> if one may not eulogize on the fourteenth of Iyyar, <b>all the more so</b> one may not eulogize on the fourteenth of Nisan. <b>Here too,</b> if a limb from a living person is impure, <b>all the more so</b> a limb from a corpse is impure. Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him:</b> Despite this reasoning, <b>such</b> is the ruling <b>I heard</b> from my teachers.
§The mishna teaches that Rabbi Meir holds that with regard to a partially severed limb of a person, after the person dies the limb imparts impurity as a limb from a living person but not as a limb from a corpse. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the impurity of <b>a limb from a living</b> person <b>and</b> the impurity of <b>a limb from a corpse?</b> The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to the case of <b>an olive-bulk of flesh, or a bone</b> the volume of <b>a barley grain, that separates from</b> the severed <b>limb of a living</b> person.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 6:3): In the case of <b>an olive-bulk of flesh that separates from a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> person, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> it <b>impure, and Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana and Rabbi Yehoshua deem</b> it <b>pure.</b> In the case of <b>a bone</b> the volume of <b>a barley-grain that separates from a limb</b> severed <b>from a living</b> person, <b>Rabbi Neḥunya deems</b> it <b>impure, and Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua deem</b> it <b>pure.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>, it is possible to say that the difference <b>between the first <i>tanna</i></b> in the mishna, i.e., Rabbi Meir, <b>and Rabbi Shimon</b> is <b>also</b> with regard to the cases of <b>an olive-bulk of flesh and a bone</b> the size of <b>a barley grain.</b> Rabbi Meir states that the partially severed limb of a person imparts the impurity of a limb from a living person but not the impurity of a limb from a corpse. The difference between these two types of impurity is with regard to a case where either an olive-bulk of flesh or a bone the size of a barley grain was separated from the severed limb; Rabbi Neḥunya holds that flesh that separated from a limb of a living person is pure, but a bone that separated from a limb of a living person is impure, and Rabbi Eliezer holds vice versa. Rabbi Meir consequently holds in accordance with one of these two opinions. Rabbi Shimon holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua that both a bone and flesh that separated from a limb of a living person are pure.

Daf 130a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mitzva to give <b>the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw</b> of slaughtered animals to the priests, known as the gifts of the priesthood, <b>applies</b> both <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>in the presence of the Temple and not in the presence of the Temple,</b> and it applies <b>to non-sacred</b> animals, <b>but not to sacrificial</b> animals.
It is necessary to emphasize that it does not apply to sacrificial animals, <b>as by right it should be</b> inferred <i>a fortiori</i>: <b>If non-sacred</b> animals, <b>which are not obligated to</b> have the <b>breast and thigh</b> taken from them and given to the priest, <b>are obligated to</b> have <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood given from them, then with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>which are obligated to</b> have the <b>breast and thigh</b> given from them, <b>is it not right that</b> they should be <b>obligated to</b> have <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood given from them?
Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “For the breast of waving and the thigh of giving I have taken of the children of Israel from the sacrifice of the peace offerings, <b>and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as a due forever</b> from the children of Israel” (Leviticus 7:34), from which it is derived that the priest <b>has only that which is stated with regard to</b> that <b>matter,</b> i.e., the breast and the thigh, and not the foreleg, the jaw and the maw.
<b>All sacrificial</b> animals in <b>which a permanent blemish preceded their consecration</b> do not assume inherent sanctity, and only their value is consecrated. <b>And</b> once <b>they were redeemed,</b> they <b>are obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>a firstborn,</b> i.e., their offspring are subject to being counted a firstborn, <b>and in the gifts</b> of the priesthood, <b>and they can emerge</b> from their sacred status and assume <b>non-sacred</b> status <b>with regard to being shorn and with regard to being utilized for labor,</b> as it is prohibited to shear animals with sacred status or utilize them for labor. <b>And their offspring and their milk are permitted after their redemption.</b>
<b>And one who slaughters</b> these animals <b>outside</b> the Temple courtyard is <b>exempt</b> from <i>karet</i>, <b>and</b> those animals <b>do not render</b> an animal that was <b>a substitute</b> for them consecrated. <b>And if</b> these animals <b>died</b> before they were redeemed, <b>they may be redeemed</b> and fed to dogs. Although typically sacrificial animals that were redeemed may not be fed to the dogs, in this case it is permitted. This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all animals <b>except for the firstborn</b> animal <b>and the</b> animal <b>tithe,</b> whose sanctity is inherent, even when a permanent blemish preceded their consecration.
With regard to <b>all</b> sacrificial animals <b>whose consecration preceded their blemish, or</b> who had <b>a temporary blemish prior to their consecration and afterward developed a permanent blemish and they were redeemed, they are exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>a firstborn, and from the gifts</b> of the priestood, <b>and they do not emerge</b> from their sacred status and assume <b>non-sacred</b> status <b>with regard to being shorn and with regard to being utilized for labor.</b>
<b>And their offspring,</b> which were conceived prior to redemption, <b>and their milk, are prohibited after their redemption. And one who slaughters them outside</b> the Temple courtyard is <b>liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i>, <b>and</b> those animals <b>render</b> an animal that was <b>a substitute</b> for them consecrated. <b>And if</b> these animals <b>died</b> before they were redeemed, they may not be redeemed and fed to dogs; rather, <b>they must be buried.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the verse: “And have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons” (Leviticus 7:34), indicates that only the breast and thigh, which are the subject of that verse, are given from sacrificial animals to the priest, but gifts of the priesthood are not given from sacrificial animals. The Gemara infers: The <b>reason</b> sacrificial animals are not included in the mitzva of gifts of the priesthood is due to the fact <b>that the Merciful One writes: “Them,”</b> in reference to the breast and the thigh of sacrificial animals. <b>But</b> were it <b>not</b> for <b>this, I would say</b> by <i>a fortiori</i> inference that <b>sacrificial</b> animals are <b>obligated to</b> have <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood given from them.
The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to derive this <i>halakha</i> from a verse? The <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about non-sacred</b> animals? They are unique <b>in that</b> they <b>are obligated</b> in the mitzva of <b>a firstborn,</b> whereas sacrificial animals are exempt. Therefore, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference stated in the mishna should not apply.
The Gemara responds: One could <b>derive</b> that the mitzva to give the gifts of the priesthood applies to sacrificial animals through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>from</b> non-sacred <b>male</b> animals, which do not give birth to offspring and whose owners are therefore exempt from counting their offspring a firstborn, and nevertheless are subject to the giving of the gifts of the priesthood. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about</b> non-sacred <b>male</b> animals? They are unique <b>in that</b> they are <b>obligated to</b> have <b>the first sheared wool</b> given to the priest from them.
The Gemara persists: One can derive that the obligation applies to sacrificial animals by an <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>from male goats,</b> whose owners are exempt from counting their offspring a firstborn as well as from the first sheared wool, and yet are subject to the obligation of gifts of the priesthood. The Gemara rejects this claim as well: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about male goats?</b> They are unique <b>in that they enter the pen to be tithed</b> for the animal tithe, whereas sacrificial animals are not subject to the animal tithe.
The Gemara further suggests that one can derive the obligation of sacrificial animals having the breast and thigh given from them by <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>from old</b> male goats, which have already entered the pen in order to be tithed. Consequently, the obligation of the animal tithe, the obligation of counting the offspring a firstborn, and the first sheared wool do not apply. The Gemara rejects this suggestion as well: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about old</b> male goats? They are unique <b>in that they</b> have <b>entered the pen to be tithed,</b> which is not the case with regard to sacrificial animals.
The Gemara again suggests that perhaps one can derive the obligation of giving gifts of the priesthood with regard to sacrificial animals by an <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>from a purchased</b> animal, to which the obligation of the animal tithe never applies. <b>Or</b> perhaps it can be derived from <b>an orphaned</b> animal, born after the death of its mother, which is also not subject to the obligation of animal tithe. The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>What</b> is unique <b>about a purchased</b> animal <b>or an orphaned</b> animal? They are unique <b>in that</b> although they themselves do not enter the pen, animals <b>of their type enter the pen to be tithed.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>You say</b> that it is significant that animals <b>of their type</b> enter the pen? With regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>as well,</b> non-sacred animals <b>of their type enter the pen to be tithed.</b> Accordingly, one can claim <i>a fortiori</i> that the mitzva to give the gifts applies to sacrificial animals, and it is only due to the verse that they are exempt.
§ The Gemara challenges: <b>And</b> now that it has been established that the obligation of the gifts of the priesthood does not apply to sacrificial animals, <b>non-sacred</b> animals <b>should be obligated to</b> have the <b>breast and thigh</b> given from them <b>by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If sacrificial</b> animals, <b>which are not obligated to</b> have <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood given from them, are nevertheless <b>obligated to</b> have the <b>breast and thigh</b> given from them, then with regard to <b>non-sacred</b> animals, <b>which are obligated to</b> have <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood given from them, <b>is it not right that</b> they should be <b>obligated to</b> have the <b>breast and thigh</b> given from them?
The Gemara responds that the <b>verse states: “And this shall be the priests’ due</b> from the people, from them that perform a slaughter, whether it be an ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). The verse indicates that <b>“this,”</b> the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw, <b>yes,</b> is given to the priests, but <b>another item,</b> i.e., the breast and thigh, is <b>not</b> given to the priests from non-sacred slaughtered animals.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> this derivation indicates that the <b>reason</b> the giving of the breast and thigh does not apply to non-sacred animals is that <b>the Merciful One writes “this,”</b> from which it may be inferred if <b>not</b> for <b>this, I would say</b> that one is <b>obligated to</b> give the <b>breast and thigh</b> from <b>non-sacred</b> animals. <b>But</b> the procedure for giving the breast and thigh <b>requires waving,</b> and <b>where would one wave</b> the breast and thigh of a non-sacred animal? <b>If</b> it is suggested that one wave them <b>outside</b> the Temple, that cannot be done, as <b>it is written:</b> “That the breast may be waved for a wave offering <b>before the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 7:30), indicating that they must be waved inside the Temple.

Daf 130b

<b>If</b> it is suggested that they should be waved <b>inside</b> the Temple, that too cannot be correct, because one who waves them inside the Temple thereby <b>brings a non-sacred</b> animal <b>into the</b> Temple <b>courtyard. Therefore,</b> since it is <b>not possible</b> to perform the procedure of giving the breast and thigh with non-sacred animals, it is not necessary for a verse to teach that the giving of the breast and thigh does not apply to such animals.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse to state: <b>“This</b> shall be the priests’ due” (Deuteronomy 18:3)? The Gemara answers: The verse is necessary <b>for that which Rav Ḥisda</b> taught, <b>as Rav Ḥisda said: One who causes damage</b> to <b>gifts of the priesthood, or who consumed them</b> before they were given to the priests, is <b>exempt from</b> having <b>to pay</b> to the priest, as the verse states: “This shall be the priests’ due,” which indicates that only the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw themselves, not their replacements, are given to the priests.
§ The Gemara analyzes <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>one who causes damage</b> to <b>gifts of the priesthood or who consumed them</b> is <b>exempt from</b> having <b>to pay</b> a substitute to the priest. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? If you wish, say that</b> it is because <b>“this” is written</b> in the verse, indicating that only the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw themselves are given to the priests, as explained above. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is <b>because it is money that has no claimants.</b> Since one may give the gifts to any priest, no single priest can issue a claim on them.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“And this shall be the priests’ due [<i>mishpat</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:3), which <b>teaches that the gifts</b> given to the priests are considered <b>a judgment,</b> as <i>mishpat</i> can mean judgment. The Gemara continues: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> are the gifts a judgment? Is it <b>not with regard to extracting</b> them <b>through judges,</b> i.e., a priest may claim them in court and the court will order the individual to give the gifts to that priest? If so, the gifts are considered to be money that has claimants. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> they are a judgment <b>with regard to distributing them through judges,</b> i.e., the court dictates to the owner to which type of priests he should give the gifts.
<b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with that which Rav Shmuel bar Naḥmani</b> taught, <b>as Rav Shmuel bar Naḥmani said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one does not give a gift</b> of the priesthood <b>to a priest</b> who is <b>an <i>am ha’aretz</i>?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And he commanded the people who dwelled in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and of the Levites, so that they may firmly adhere to the Torah of the Lord”</b> (II Chronicles 31:4). This indicates that <b>anyone who firmly adheres to the Torah of the Lord has a portion, and one who does not firmly adhere to the Torah of the Lord does not have a portion.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof with regard to the statement of Rav Ḥisda from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says</b> that the phrase “And this shall be the priests’ <b>due” teaches that the gifts</b> of the priesthood are <b>a judgment.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that the gifts of the <b>breast and thigh</b> are <b>also a judgment.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “This,”</b> to teach that only the gifts of the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw are called a judgment.
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to what</b> matter is this <i>halakha</i> stated? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>with regard to distributing</b> them <b>through judges, is that to say</b> that the <b>breast and thigh are not distributed through judges?</b> These are also called a “portion” (II Chronicles 31:4), and therefore the court determines to which priests they should be given, as stated above. <b>Rather, is it not</b> stated <b>with regard to extracting</b> them <b>through judges?</b> If so, one can infer from the <i>baraita</i> that gifts of the priesthood can be extracted in court by a priest, which contradicts the statement of Rav Ḥisda.
The Gemara responds: <b>Here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the gifts already <b>came into</b> the priest’s <b>possession,</b> and the owner stole them from him. The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the priest may claim them in court and the court will order that they be returned to him. The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> this is a case <b>where they came into his possession, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> that the priest may claim them in court? That is obvious, as they already belong to him. The Gemara responds: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where they came into his possession while they</b> were still <b>untithed,</b> i.e., the priest received the entire animal before the gifts were separated, <b>and this <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>gifts that have not been separated are considered as though they have been separated.</b> Accordingly, the gifts belong to the priest, and if the owner takes them from him against his will it is considered theft.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof with regard to the statement of Rav Ḥisda from a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 5:4): In the case of <b>a homeowner who was passing from place to place,</b> and he ran out of money while traveling <b>and needs to take gleanings, forgotten</b> sheaves, <b><i>pe’a</i>, or the poor man’s tithe</b> in order to sustain himself, he may <b>take</b> them, <b>and when he returns</b> to his house <b>he will pay</b> a poor person for whatever he took; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.</b> The mishna teaches that a poor person may extract payment for that which the homeowner took, despite the fact that he never had possession of the gifts. This ruling apparently contradicts the statement of Rav Ḥisda.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The mishna <b>taught an attribute of piety here,</b> i.e., strictly speaking a poor person has no right to claim any amount from the homeowner for what he took. <b>Rava said</b> in bewilderment: <b>The <i>tanna</i> taught</b> explicitly that <b>he will pay, and you say</b> that he <b>taught an attribute of piety here? And furthermore, should</b> one <b>arise and raise an objection from</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with his opinion.
<b>Rather,</b> the objection is <b>from the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that the homeowner is not required to pay for what he took during his travels, as <b>he was</b> considered <b>poor at that time.</b> It may be inferred that the <b>reason</b> he is exempt from payment is only <b>that</b> he was considered <b>poor</b> at the time, <b>but</b> if he were considered <b>wealthy,</b> he would have to <b>pay</b> the poor people who issue a claim against him in court, as he was not entitled to those gifts.
The Gemara explains the objection: But <b>why</b> must he pay? <b>Let it be</b> considered <b>like</b> a case where one <b>causes damage to gifts of the priesthood or consumes them,</b> with regard to which Rav Ḥisda states that he is not required to pay the priest. The opinion of the Rabbis apparently contradicts the statement of Rav Ḥisda. <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> Even if the homeowner was considered wealthy at the time he is not required to pay, and the Rabbis who obligated him to pay <b>taught an attribute of piety here.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a homeowner who consumed his produce</b> while it was <b>untithed,</b> i.e., neither <i>teruma</i> nor the first tithe had been separated, <b>and similarly,</b> with regard to <b>a Levite who consumed his tithes</b> while they were <b>untithed,</b> i.e., <i>teruma</i> of the tithe had not been separated, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> he is <b>exempt from payment? The verse states: “And they shall not profane the sacred things of the children of Israel, which they set apart</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:15). This teaches that <b>you,</b> the priest, <b>have</b> rights <b>to them only from the time of separation onward.</b> Since the produce was eaten before <i>teruma</i> was separated from it, the priest cannot claim payment for it in court.
The Gemara infers from this ruling: This indicates that if it was consumed <b>from the time of separation onward,</b> the priest may <b>in any event</b> claim payment for the <i>teruma</i> in court, and the one who consumed it must <b>pay.</b> But <b>why</b> must one pay? <b>Let it be like</b> a case where one <b>causes damage to gifts of the priesthood or consumes them,</b> with regard to which Rav Ḥisda states that he is exempt from payment. The Gemara responds: <b>Here too,</b>

Daf 131a

the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where they came into</b> the priest’s <b>possession while they</b> were still <b>untithed, and this <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>gifts that have not been separated are considered as though they have been separated.</b> In such a case, the priest obtained rights to the ownerless gifts by seizing them first. Although when he seized the produce it was still untithed, the portion of the produce that is to be separated has the status of <i>teruma</i>. Accordingly, one who consumes such produce is required to pay the priest.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof with regard to the statement of Rav Ḥisda from a <i>baraita</i>: In a case <b>where the household of the king seized one’s threshing floor</b> by force, <b>if</b> they took it <b>as</b> payment of <b>his debt</b> owed to the king, then <b>he is obligated to tithe</b> other grain in accordance with the amount he would have tithed before the grain was seized. Since he was already obligated to tithe the grain before it was seized, it is considered as though the grain was sold in an untithed state. <b>If they took it without reason [<i>anparot</i>],</b> then <b>he is exempt from tithing.</b> The fact that one is required to tithe grain seized as payment of a debt indicates that the tithe is considered money that has claimants, from which it follows that a priest may extract payment of the tithe from him. Again, this apparently contradicts the statement of Rav Ḥisda.
The Gemara rejects this proof: It <b>is different there,</b> since if one is not required to tithe grain seized as payment of a debt, this would mean <b>that</b> the seizure <b>causes benefit for him,</b> as he will be exempt from tithing grain that he was previously obligated to tithe. It is for this reason that the <i>baraita</i> rules that one must tithe other grain instead of the seized grain, not because a priest could have issued a claim against him in court.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (132a): If an Israelite <b>says</b> to a butcher: <b>Sell me the innards of</b> a particular <b>cow, and there were gifts of the priesthood</b> included <b>with it,</b> i.e., the maw, that were not yet given to the priest, the purchaser <b>must give them to the priest, and</b> the butcher <b>may not deduct</b> the value of the gifts <b>from the money</b> that the purchaser pays <b>him,</b> as it is assumed that the gifts were not included in the sale. If <b>he purchased</b> the innards <b>from</b> the butcher <b>by weight,</b> the purchaser <b>must give</b> the gifts <b>to the priest, and</b> the butcher <b>deducts</b> the value of the gifts <b>from the money</b> that the Israelite pays <b>him.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> must the buyer give the maw to the priest? <b>Let</b> the butcher’s sale of the maw <b>be</b> considered <b>like</b> a case where one <b>causes damage to gifts of the priesthood or consumes them,</b> with regard to which Rav Ḥisda states that one is exempt from payment. This mishna apparently contradicts Rav Ḥisda’s statement. The Gemara rejects this: It <b>is different there, as</b> the gifts <b>are intact,</b> i.e., they are distinct items in their own right. In such a case, the gifts must be given to the priest. By contrast, Rav Ḥisda is discussing cases in which the gifts are not distinguishable objects at the time.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof: <b>Nine</b> items are the <b>property of a priest: <i>Teruma</i>, <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> the portion of dough given to the priest, <b>the first sheared</b> wool, <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood, <b>doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>], first fruits, the principal</b> value of the property of a convert, <b>and the</b> additional <b>one-fifth.</b> The two are paid to the priest in a case where the property of a convert was stolen and the thief took an oath that he did not steal it, and after the convert died the thief admitted to taking a false oath.
The Gemara explains the proof: <b>With regard to what</b> matter are these items considered the property of a priest? <b>Is it not with regard to extracting them with judges,</b> which would contradict the opinion of Rav Ḥisda? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is <b>with regard to that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:12): <b>To what</b> end did <b>they say</b> that these items are the <b>property of a priest?</b> It means <b>that</b> a priest may <b>purchase with them slaves and lands and a non-kosher animal; and a lender takes them</b> as payment <b>of his debt; and</b> if the <b>wife</b> of a priest is divorced from him, she takes them as payment <b>of her marriage contract; and</b> a priest may purchase <b>a Torah scroll</b> with them.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain Levite who would snatch gifts</b> of the priesthood from children who were delivering them to the priests on their fathers’ behalf. <b>They came</b> and <b>told Rav</b> about this Levite. Rav <b>said to them: Is it not enough that</b> when he slaughters his own animals <b>we do not take</b> the gifts of the priesthood <b>from him, but he also snatches</b> gifts that are being delivered to priests?
Rav’s comment indicates that in his opinion there are grounds to take the gifts from Levites, but nevertheless they are not taken. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rav</b> maintain in this regard? <b>If</b> he maintains that Levites <b>are called</b> part of the <b>“people,”</b> then <b>let one take</b> the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw <b>from them as well,</b> as the verse states: “From the people, from them that perform a slaughter, whether it be ox or sheep, they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3).
<b>And if they are not called</b> part of the <b>people,</b> then <b>the Merciful One</b> has <b>exempted them</b> from giving those gifts, and there would be no grounds to take the gifts from them. The Gemara responds: Rav <b>is uncertain whether or not they are called</b> part of the <b>people.</b> Therefore, he exempts the Levites from giving their own gifts, in accordance with the principle that the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Pappa was sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i></b> in the name of Rav. <b>Rav Idi bar Avin raised an objection to Rav Pappa</b> from a <i>baraita</i>, with regard to the uncertainty of Rav: <b>Four gifts</b> are left <b>to the poor</b> from the produce <b>of a vineyard: The individual fallen</b> grapes <b>[<i>peret</i>], and the incompletely formed clusters</b> of grapes <b>[<i>olelot</i>], and the forgotten</b> clusters, <b>and <i>pe’a</i>. And three</b> gifts are left to the poor <b>from grain: The gleanings,</b> i.e., sheaves that fell during the harvest, <b>and the forgotten</b> sheaves, <b>and the <i>pe’a</i>. Two</b> gifts are left to the poor from the fruit <b>of a tree: The forgotten</b> fruits <b>and the <i>pe’a</i>.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: With regard to <b>all of</b> these gifts, <b>the owner</b> of the produce <b>does not have the benefit of discretion.</b> This is the benefit accrued from giving a gift to an individual of one’s choice, e.g., giving <i>teruma</i> or tithes to whichever priest or Levite that one chooses. Instead, poor person who takes possession of these gifts becomes their rightful owner. <b>And even a poor person of Israel</b> who owns a vineyard, field, or tree must leave these gifts for all other poor people; and if he does not do so, <b>the court removes</b> them <b>from his possession.</b>
By contrast, with regard to the <b>poor man’s tithe, which is distributed</b> from <b>within one’s house,</b> unlike other gifts to the poor that are left in the field for them to take, <b>the owner has the benefit of discretion. And even</b> in the case of <b>a poor person in Israel,</b> if he fails to separate the poor man’s tithe from his produce, <b>the court removes it from his possession. And</b> with regard to <b>other gifts of the priesthood, such as the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw,</b> the court <b>does not remove them, neither from a priest</b> to give <b>to</b> another <b>priest, nor from a Levite</b> to give <b>to</b> another <b>Levite.</b>
Before Rav Idi bar Avin explains his objection, the Gemara cites the sources for the <i>halakhot</i> of the <i>baraita</i>: The <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>four gifts</b> are left to the poor from the produce <b>of a vineyard: The <i>peret</i>, and the <i>olelot</i>, and the forgotten</b> clusters, <b>and the <i>pe’a</i>, as it is written: “And you shall not glean [<i>te’olel</i>] your vineyard, neither shall you gather the fallen fruit [<i>peret</i>] of your vineyard;</b> you shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger” (Leviticus 19:10).
<b>And</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>written: “When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it [<i>te’olel</i>] after you;</b> it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow” (Deuteronomy 24:21). And <b>Rabbi Levi says</b> that with regard to the term <b>“after you,” this</b> is a reference to <b>forgotten</b> clusters, as the <i>halakha</i> is that clusters that were passed over by the harvester have the status of forgotten clusters, whereas those that remain in front of him do not have that status.
The <i>halakha</i> that the mitzva of <b><i>pe’a</i></b> applies to one’s vineyard is <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the term <b>“after you”</b> in that verse and the term <b>“after you” from</b> another verse concerning <b>an olive</b> tree. <b>As it is written: “When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs [<i>tefa’er</i>] after you;</b> it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow” (Deuteronomy 24:20); <b>and the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that the term “You shall not go over the boughs” means <b>that you should not take</b> all of <b>its splendor [<i>tiferet</i>] from it;</b> rather, you should leave a portion of the olives for the poor. So too, one must leave a portion of one’s vineyard as <i>pe’a</i> for the poor.
The Gemara continues: The <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>three</b> gifts are left to the poor <b>from grain: The gleanings,</b>

Daf 131b

<b>and the forgotten</b> sheaves, <b>and the <i>pe’a</i>. As it is written: “And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corner of [<i>pe’at</i>] your field,</b> neither shall you gather <b>the gleaning of your harvest;</b> you shall leave them for the poor, and for the stranger” (Leviticus 23:22). And it is also written: <b>“When you reap your harvest in your field and have forgotten a sheaf in the field,</b> you shall not go back to fetch it; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow” (Deuteronomy 24:19).
The <i>baraita</i> taught that <b>two</b> gifts are left to the poor <b>from</b> the produce <b>of a tree: The forgotten</b> fruits <b>and the <i>pe’a</i>, as it is written: “When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the boughs [<i>tefa’er</i>] after you;</b> it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow” (Deuteronomy 24:20), <b>and the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that the phrase: “You shall not go over the boughs,” means <b>that you should not take</b> all of <b>its splendor [<i>tiferet</i>] from it;</b> rather, you should leave a portion of the olives for the poor as <i>pe’a</i>. Additionally, when the verse states: <b>“After you,” this</b> is a reference to <b>forgotten</b> fruits.
The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of</b> the gifts left to the poor, <b>the owner</b> of the produce <b>does not have the benefit of discretion,</b> i.e., the right to distribute the gifts to poor people of his choosing. Instead, any poor person who takes possession of these gifts becomes their rightful owner. <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? It is because the requirement of <b>leaving is written with regard to them,</b> e.g., in the verse that states: “You shall leave them” (Leviticus 23:22).
The <i>baraita</i> also stated: <b>And even a poor person of Israel</b> who owns a vineyard, field, or tree must leave these gifts for all poor people, and if he does not, <b>the court removes</b> them <b>from his possession.</b> This is derived from a verse, <b>as it is written: “Neither the gleaning of your harvest shall you gather; for the poor you shall leave them, and for the stranger”</b> (Leviticus 23:22). Since the verse juxtaposes the words “the poor” to the mitzva in the previous clause, this serves <b>to warn a poor person</b> that he must also separate these gifts from <b>his own</b> produce.
<b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> teaches with regard to the <b>poor man’s tithe that is distributed</b> from <b>within his house</b> that <b>the owner has the benefit of discretion.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? It is because the requirement of <b>giving is written with regard to it,</b> as the verse states: “When you have made an end of tithing all the tithe of your increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing, and you shall give it to the Levite, to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within your gates, and be satisfied” (Deuteronomy 26:12). Consequently, in this case it is not left for the poor but is actively given to them.
The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And even</b> in the case of <b>a poor person in Israel,</b> if he fails to separate the poor man’s tithe from his produce, <b>the court removes it from his possession.</b> The Gemara explains that this is <b>as Rabbi Ile’a said:</b> This is <b>derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the term <b>“to the stranger”</b> stated with regard to the poor man’s tithe in the verse cited previously, and the term <b>“to the stranger” from there,</b> the mitzva to leave gleanings for the poor. <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the mitzva to leave gleanings, <b>a poor person is warned that</b> he must leave gleanings from the produce of <b>his own</b> fields, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the mitzva to separate the poor man’s tithe, <b>a poor person is warned to</b> separate it from <b>his own</b> fields.
The <i>baraita</i> taught: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>other gifts of the priesthood, such as the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw,</b> the court <b>does not remove them, neither from a priest</b> to give <b>to</b> another <b>priest nor from a Levite</b> to give <b>to</b> another <b>Levite.</b> Rav Idi bar Avin now explains his objection: It may be inferred that the court does <b>remove</b> the gifts <b>from a Levite</b> to give <b>to a priest. Evidently,</b> Levites <b>are called</b> part of the <b>“people.”</b> Accordingly, since the verse states: “And this shall be the priests’ due from the people” (Deuteronomy 18:3), the gifts of the priesthood may be removed from the possession of Levites. Why, then, was Rav uncertain with regard to their status?
The Gemara responds: The <i>baraita</i> is not referring to the actual gifts of the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw themselves. Rather, it is referring to a gift that is <b>like the foreleg,</b> the jaw, and the maw, <b>but not</b> the <b>foreleg,</b> the jaw, and the maw themselves. <b>And what is this?</b> It is the <b>first tithe.</b>
The Gemara asks: But the <b>first tithe is</b> given <b>to</b> the <b>Levite.</b> Why would it be removed from his possession? The Gemara responds: The <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Teruma</i></b> is given <b>to the priest,</b> whereas the <b>first tithe</b> is given <b>to the Levite;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says:</b> The first tithe is given <b>to the priest as well,</b> despite the fact that the Torah states that it is given to the Levite, as priests are often called Levites in the Torah.
The Gemara asks: <b>Say that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya said</b> that the first tithe is given <b>to the priest as well;</b> but <b>did he say</b> that it is given exclusively <b>to the priest and not to the Levite?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Yes;</b> although generally the first tithe is not removed from the possession of a Levite and given to a priest, the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> first tithe in the period <b>after Ezra penalized</b> the Levites for their unwillingness to return to Eretz Yisrael from Babylonia, as he decreed that they should no longer be given the first tithe.
The Gemara persists: One can <b>say that Ezra penalized them</b> and decreed <b>that we should not give them</b> first tithe, but <b>did he say</b> that first tithe should even be <b>taken from them</b> and given to the priests? <b>Rather,</b> explain instead that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a gift that is <b>like</b> the <b>foreleg,</b> the jaw, and the maw, <b>but</b> is <b>not</b> actually the <b>foreleg,</b> the jaw, or the maw. <b>And what is this?</b> It is <b>the first sheared</b> wool, with regard to which the verse states: “And the first of the fleece of your sheep, you shall give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4). Since the verse does not state that the first fleece is taken from the “people,” even Levites are obligated to give their first shearing to the priest, and it may be removed from their possession to that end.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof with regard to the uncertainty of Rav from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>This is the principle:</b> With regard to <b>any item that is of sanctity,</b> i.e., that may not be consumed by a non-priest, <b>such as <i>teruma</i>, and <i>teruma</i> of the tithe, and <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> the court <b>removes it from the possession</b> of a Levite in order to give it to the priests. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>any item that is not of sanctity, such as the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw,</b> which are given from a non-sacred animal, the court <b>does not remove it from the possession</b> of the Levites to give to the priests. Evidently, Levites are not called part of the “people,” and therefore they are exempt from giving the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw.
The Gemara rejects this proof: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a gift that is <b>like</b> the <b>foreleg,</b> the jaw, and the maw, <b>but</b> is <b>not</b> actually the <b>foreleg,</b> the jaw, and the maw themselves. <b>And what is this?</b> It is <b>first tithe, and</b> the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with first tithe in the period <b>after Ezra penalized</b> the Levites and decreed that the first tithe should be given to the priests rather than the Levites. Nevertheless, if a Levite received the first tithe it may not be removed from his possession, since this penalty was not included in Ezra’s decree.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: An Israelite <b>who slaughters</b> an animal <b>for a priest or for a gentile</b> is <b>exempt from</b> giving <b>the gifts,</b> as priests and gentiles are exempt from this obligation. The Gemara infers: This indicates that if an Israelite slaughtered an animal <b>for a Levite or for an Israelite,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to give the gifts, and they may be removed from his possession to that end. Evidently, Levites are called part of the “people,” and Rav should not have been uncertain with regard to their status. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Do not say</b> that one should infer that if an Israelite slaughtered an animal <b>for a Levite or for an Israelite</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to give the gifts. <b>Rather, say</b> merely that if an Israelite slaughtered an animal <b>for</b> another <b>Israelite,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to give the gifts.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, when one slaughters an animal <b>for a Levite, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is one <b>exempt? If so, let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach: One who slaughters</b> an animal <b>for a Levite or for a gentile</b> is <b>exempt from</b> giving <b>the gifts,</b> and it would be obvious that this is also the <i>halakha</i> when one slaughters for a priest. <b>And furthermore, isn’t it taught</b> explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one who slaughters for a priest or for a gentile</b> is <b>exempt from</b> giving <b>the gifts,</b> whereas one who slaughters <b>for a Levite or for an Israelite</b> is <b>obligated</b> to give the gifts? This <i>baraita</i> apparently constitutes <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the uncertainty <b>of Rav.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>Rav</b> could <b>say to you</b> that although this <i>baraita</i> is in fact contrary to his opinion, the question of whether or not Levites are called part of the “people” <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states with regard to the Yom Kippur Temple service: “And he shall make atonement for the most holy place, and he shall make atonement for the Tent of Meeting and for the altar; and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly” (Leviticus 16:33). The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>“And he shall make atonement for the most holy place”; this</b> is referring to <b>the innermost sanctum,</b> i.e., the bull and goat offerings brought on Yom Kippur atone for ritual impurity occurring inside the Holy of Holies.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>“Tent of Meeting”; this</b> is referring to the <b>Sanctuary,</b> i.e., the offerings atone for impurity occurring inside the Sanctuary. <b>“Altar”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning,</b> i.e., the offerings atone for one who performs sacrificial rites on the altar in a state of ritual impurity. <b>“He shall make atonement”; this</b> is referring to the Temple <b>courtyards,</b> i.e., the offerings atone for impurity occurring there. “For <b>the priests”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning,</b> indicating that the offerings atone for a priest who unwittingly enters the courtyard while impure. “And for all the <b>people of the assembly”; these are the Israelites. “He shall make atonement”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Levites.</b>
<b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“He shall make atonement”; this</b> is referring to Canaanite <b>slaves</b> in the possession of Jews. These slaves are obligated in certain mitzvot and are therefore in need of atonement. The Gemara analyzes these sources: Why doesn’t the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> interpret the term “He shall make atonement” as a reference to Levites? <b>What, is it not</b> that <b>they disagree about this, as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that Levites are <b>called</b> part of the <b>“people”</b> and are therefore included in the clause “the people of the assembly,” and consequently, the term “he shall make atonement” is not required to include the Levites but instead serves to include Canaanite slaves. <b>And</b> by contrast, one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>they are not called</b> part of the <b>“people,”</b> which means that the term “He shall make atonement” is required to include Levites.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if this is a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>, why is <b>Rav</b> uncertain with regard to the status of Levites? <b>If he holds in accordance with this <i>tanna</i>, let him say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with him, <b>and if he holds in accordance with that <i>tanna</i>, let him say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with him. The Gemara responds: Rav <b>is uncertain whether</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with this <i>tanna</i> or in accordance with that <i>tanna</i>.</b>
<b>Mareimar taught: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav</b> that it is uncertain whether or not Levites are called part of the “people.” Consequently, the court may not compel Levites to give the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw to the priests. <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b> who said that one who damages or consumes gifts of the priesthood is exempt from payment.
§ With regard to the gifts of the priesthood, the Gemara relates that <b>Ulla would give gifts</b> of the priesthood <b>to a female priest,</b> i.e., the daughter of a priest, even if she was married to an Israelite. <b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the practice of <b>Ulla</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The remainder of <b>a meal offering of a female priest is consumed,</b> just like the remainder of the meal offering of an Israelite. But the remainder of <b>a meal offering of a priest is not consumed,</b> as the verse states: “And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten” (Leviticus 6:16).
Rava explains his objection: <b>And if you say</b> that one may give gifts of <b>a priest even</b> to <b>a female priest,</b> because when the verse mentions a priest it is referring even to the daughter of a priest, <b>but isn’t it written: “And every meal offering of the priest shall be wholly made to smoke; it shall not be eaten”?</b> Why, then, is the remainder of a meal offering of the daughter of a priest consumed? Ulla <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>My teacher,</b>

Daf 132a

<b>from your burden [<i>mitunakh</i>],</b> i.e., from that which you raise your objection, I can cite a proof for my practice: With regard to the meal offering of a priest, both <b>Aaron and his sons are written in the passage</b> discussing this offering: “And this is the law of the meal offering: The sons of Aaron shall offer it before the Lord, in front of the altar” (Leviticus 6:7). The verse emphasizes that these <i>halakhot</i> apply only to male priests and not to their daughters. This indicates that when the verse refers merely to priests, even their daughters are included. Accordingly, one may give gifts of the priesthood to the daughter of a priest.
The Gemara cites the opinions of various <i>tanna’im</i> with regard to the practice of Ulla: <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> Anywhere that the Torah mentions a priest with regard to gifts of the priesthood, it is referring specifically to <b>a priest and not a female priest, and</b> let one <b>derive</b> the meaning of <b>an unspecified</b> reference to a priest <b>from the explicit</b> verse that states with regard to meal offerings: “Aaron and his sons.” This verse indicates that any reference to a priest excludes a priest’s daughter.
<b>The school of Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov taught:</b> In general, the reference to a priest in a verse serves to exclude a priest’s daughter. But when the verse mentions <b>a priest</b> with regard to gifts of the priesthood, it means to include <b>even a female priest.</b> This is because the verse mentions priests twice: “And this shall be the priests’ due from the people, from them that perform a slaughter, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). Since each reference to a priest excludes the daughter of a priest, this verse <b>is</b> a case of <b>a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression, and</b> there is a hermeneutical principle that <b>a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression</b> serves <b>only to amplify</b> the <i>halakha</i> and include additional cases, in this instance, the daughter of a priest.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Kahana,</b> who was an Israelite, <b>partook</b> of gifts of the priesthood <b>on account of his wife,</b> who was the daughter of a priest. Similarly, <b>Rav Pappa partook</b> of gifts of the priesthood <b>on account of his wife, Rav Yeimar partook</b> of gifts <b>on account of his wife,</b> and <b>Rav Idi bar Avin partook</b> of them <b>on account of his wife.</b>
<b>Ravina said: Mareimar said to me</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav</b> that it is uncertain whether or not Levites are obligated to give the gifts of the priesthood, and consequently, gifts are not removed from their possession to be given to the priests. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda</b> that one who damages or consumes gifts of the priesthood is exempt from payment. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Ulla</b> that gifts of the priesthood may be given to the daughter of a priest.
<b>And</b> in a case not previously discussed but related to the opinion of Ulla, <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> with regard to <b>a female Levite,</b> i.e., the daughter of a Levite, <b>who gave birth</b> to a firstborn boy, even if she is married to an Israelite, that <b>her son is exempt from</b> the obligation to give <b>five <i>sela</i></b> to the priest for his redemption, as the child is considered the son of a Levite, and Levites are exempt from this obligation.
§ The Gemara cites a dispute with regard to the gifts of the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The obligation to give <b>the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw applies</b> even <b>to a hybrid</b> animal <b>and to</b> the animal known as <b>a <i>koy</i>. Rabbi Eliezer says: A hybrid</b> that <b>results from</b> the mating of <b>a goat and a ewe is obligated to</b> have <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood given from it, while a hybrid that results <b>from</b> the mating of <b>a goat and a doe is exempt from</b> having <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood given from it. This is because the verse states with regard to gifts of the priesthood: “Whether it be an ox or sheep” (Deuteronomy 18:3), i.e., a domesticated animal, and a doe is not a domesticated animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>Now, we maintain</b> (see 79b–80a) <b>with regard to</b> the mitzvot of <b>covering the blood and</b> giving the <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood that <b>you do not find</b> that Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis disagree <b>except in</b> the case of an animal born from <b>a deer that mates with a female goat. And both Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis are uncertain whether one</b> needs <b>to be concerned with its paternity</b> when determining the species of a hybrid animal, which would mean that this animal is part domesticated and part undomesticated, or <b>whether one does not</b> need to be <b>concerned</b> with paternity and the species of an animal is determined entirely by the species of its mother, in which case it is a domesticated animal.
<b>And</b> they <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether the obligation of the gifts applies to <b>a sheep and even</b> an animal that is <b>partially a sheep,</b> i.e., partially domesticated. One <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that the obligation applies to <b>a sheep and even</b> an animal that is <b>partially a sheep; and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>we do not say</b> that the obligation applies to <b>a sheep and even</b> an animal that is <b>partially a sheep.</b>
The Gemara concludes its question: <b>Granted,</b> it is understandable that <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> the owner of a hybrid <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva to give the priestly gifts, as <b>he holds</b> that only in the case of <b>a sheep</b> is one obligated to give gifts of the priesthood, <b>but not</b> with regard to animals that are only <b>partially sheep. But according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, though indeed they hold</b> that <b>sheep and even</b> animals that are <b>partially sheep</b> are subject to the obligation of giving gifts of the priesthood, <b>let</b> the priest <b>take</b> only <b>half</b> of the gifts. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the other half, let</b> the owner of the animal <b>say to him: Bring proof that one</b> need <b>not be concerned with its paternity and</b> then you may <b>take</b> the other half. <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya said</b> in response: <b>What</b> do the Rabbis mean <b>when they say</b> that the owner of this animal is <b>obligated?</b> They mean that he is <b>obligated in half of the gifts.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises an objection</b> to this response from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a <i>koy</i>,</b> with regard to which it is uncertain whether it is a domesticated animal or an undomesticated one, <b>there are ways</b> in which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>a domesticated animal, and there are ways</b> in which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of <b>an undomesticated animal. And there are ways in</b> which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> those of both <b>an undomesticated animal and a domesticated animal.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> elaborates: <b>How so? Its fat is forbidden like</b> the forbidden <b>fat</b> of <b>a domesticated animal,</b> unlike that of an undomesticated one. <b>And</b> one is <b>obligated to cover its blood</b> from slaughter with dirt, <b>like the blood</b> of <b>an undomesticated animal.</b> And there are <b>ways</b> in which its <i>halakhot</i> <b>correspond to</b> both those of <b>a domesticated animal and an undomesticated animal, as its blood and its sciatic nerve are forbidden like</b> those of <b>a domesticated animal and an undomesticated animal. And</b> its owner is <b>obligated</b> to give the <b>foreleg, the jaw, and the maw</b> from it to the priest, as in the case of domesticated animals. <b>And Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> the owner of a <i>koy</i> <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva to give the gifts.
Rabbi Zeira asks: <b>And if it is so</b> that the Rabbis mean that the owner of a <i>koy</i> is obligated to give half of the gifts, then the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> said that he is <b>obligated to</b> give <b>half of the gifts</b> from it. The Gemara responds: <b>Since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> that <b>its fat and its blood</b> are forbidden, with regard to <b>which it</b> could <b>not teach</b> that <b>half</b> of its blood or <b>half</b> of its fat are forbidden, as it is impossible that half of it is forbidden while the other half is permitted, <b>due to that</b> reason the <i>tanna</i> <b>did not teach</b> that the owner of a <i>koy</i> is obligated in <b>half</b> of the gifts.
The Gemara relates that <b>when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: According to the Rabbis, a <i>koy</i> is obligated to</b> have <b>all of the gifts</b> of the priesthood given from it. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the gifts of the priesthood: “Whether it be an ox or sheep” (Deuteronomy 18:3). Since the verse needed to state only <b>“ox,” why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Whether it be an ox”?</b> This phrase serves <b>to include a hybrid</b> in the obligation to give the gifts of the priesthood. And since the verse needed to state only <b>“sheep,” why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Or sheep”?</b> This phrase serves <b>to include the <i>koy</i></b> in the obligation to give the gifts.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who deems the owners of a <i>koy</i> and the offspring of a hybrid exempt from giving gifts of the priesthood from these animals, <b>why do I</b> need <b>this</b> phrase: <b>“Whether</b> it be an ox or sheep”? The Gemara responds: <b>He requires it to divide</b> between an ox and a sheep, indicating that one is obligated with regard to either animal alone. Were it not for this phrase, one might have concluded that he is obligated to give the gifts only after slaughtering both an ox and a sheep. The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who derive other <i>halakhot</i> from this phrase, <b>from where do they</b> derive <b>to divide</b> between an ox and a sheep? The Gemara responds: <b>They derive it</b> from the phrase: <b>“From them that perform a slaughter”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:3), which indicates that the obligation to give the gifts applies even to one animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Eliezer, what does he do with this</b> phrase: <b>“From them that perform a slaughter,”</b> i.e., what does he derive from it? The Gemara responds: <b>He requires it for</b> a statement <b>of Rava, as Rava said:</b> If a priest seeks to claim gifts of the priesthood in court, the priest issues his <b>demand with the butcher,</b> even if the animal itself belongs to another individual.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to a blemished <b>firstborn</b> animal, which one may slaughter and eat without being required to give the foreleg, jaw, and maw to the priest, <b>that was intermingled with one hundred</b> non-sacred animals, from which one is required to give those gifts, in a case <b>when one hundred</b> different people <b>slaughter all of them,</b> each slaughtering one animal, one <b>exempts them all</b> from giving the gifts, as each could claim that the animal that he slaughtered was the firstborn. If <b>one</b> person <b>slaughtered them all,</b> one <b>exempts one</b> of the animals <b>for him.</b>
<b>One who slaughters</b> the animal of a priest <b>for the priest or</b> the animal of a gentile <b>for the gentile is exempt from</b> the obligation to give <b>the gifts</b> of the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw. <b>And</b> an Israelite <b>who enters into partnership with</b> a priest or a gentile <b>must mark</b> the animal to indicate that it is jointly owned and exempt from the obligation to give the gifts. <b>And if</b> a priest sold his animal to an Israelite and <b>said:</b> The animal is sold <b>except for the gifts</b> with it, the Israelite is <b>exempt from</b> the obligation to give <b>the gifts,</b> as they are not his.
If the Israelite <b>said</b> to the one slaughtering the animal: <b>Sell me the innards of a cow, and there were gifts</b> included <b>with it,</b> i.e., the maw, the purchaser <b>gives them to the priest and he does not deduct</b> the value of the gifts <b>from the money</b> that he pays <b>him.</b> If <b>he bought</b> the innards <b>from</b> the slaughterer <b>by weight,</b> the purchaser <b>gives</b> the gifts, i.e., the maw, <b>to the priest and deducts</b> the value of the gifts <b>from the money</b> that he pays <b>him.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if a firstborn animal was intermingled with one hundred non-sacred animals, each belonging to a different person, all of the animals are excluded from the obligation to give the gifts, due to the uncertainty of which animal is the firstborn. The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is this the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Let the priest come upon</b> each slaughterer with a claim <b>from two sides,</b> i.e., <b>let</b> the priest <b>say to him: If</b> this animal <b>is a firstborn, it is completely mine; and if it is not a firstborn</b> but is instead a non-sacred animal, then <b>give me my gifts.</b>

Daf 132b

<b>Rav Oshaya says</b> in response: In general, a priest may issue such a claim. But the mishna is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the firstborn <b>came into the possession of</b> the <b>priest</b> when it was unblemished and thereafter it developed a permanent blemish, <b>and</b> the priest <b>sold it to an Israelite in its blemished</b> state. In such a case, the priest may not demand that the owner give him the entire animal with the claim that it is a firstborn, as he already received it once as a firstborn.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>one who slaughters</b> the animal of a priest <b>for the priest or</b> the animal of a gentile <b>for the gentile is exempt from</b> the obligation to give <b>the gifts</b> of the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw. The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> simply <b>teach</b> that <b>a priest and a gentile are exempt from</b> the obligation to give <b>the gifts. Rava says</b> in explanation: <b>That is to say,</b> i.e., the wording of the mishna indicates, that <b>the demand</b> of a priest who seeks to claim gifts of the priesthood is <b>with the butcher,</b> not with the owner of the animal. Even if the butcher is himself a priest, if he slaughters an animal on behalf of an Israelite he is obligated to give the gifts.
The Gemara adds: <b>Rava</b> also <b>interpreted</b> the verse in such a manner. The verse states: “This shall be the priests’ due from the people, from them that perform a slaughter, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). The verse specifies that the gifts are taken <b>“from the people,” and not from the priests. When</b> the verse <b>states: “From them that perform a slaughter,”</b> indicating that the gifts are given by anyone who slaughters an animal, <b>you must say</b> that this teaches that <b>even a butcher</b> who is <b>a priest is included</b> in the obligation to give the gifts.
§ The mishna teaches that the obligation to give the gifts of the priesthood does not apply to an animal jointly owned by an Israelite and a priest. The Gemara relates that the <b>host [<i>ushpizikhnei</i>] of Rabbi Tavla was a priest and he was hard-pressed</b> for money. <b>He came before Rabbi Tavla</b> to ask for advice. Rabbi Tavla <b>said to him: Go</b> and <b>enter into a partnership with those Israelite butchers,</b> to obtain part ownership of their animals, <b>as since they</b> will be <b>exempt from</b> the obligation to give the <b>gifts</b> on account of this partnership, they will agree to <b>enter into</b> a business <b>partnership with you</b> free of charge.
The priest heeded the advice of Rabbi Tavla and entered into a partnership with an Israelite butcher. Nevertheless, <b>Rav Naḥman obligated</b> the butcher to give the gifts of the priesthood from the animals he slaughtered. The priest <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>But Rabbi Tavla exempted us</b> from this obligation. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Go remove</b> the gifts of the priesthood that are in your possession and give them to a priest, <b>and if</b> you will <b>not</b> do so, <b>I will remove Rabbi Tavla from your ear [<i>me’unakh</i>],</b> i.e., I will refute his basis for deeming you exempt.
<b>Rabbi Tavla came before Rav Naḥman</b> and <b>said to him: What is the reason</b> that the <b>Master has done this</b> and ruled in contradiction to the mishna? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> I ruled in this manner, <b>as when Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina of the south came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he <b>said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> and all <b>the elders of the south said:</b> With regard to <b>a priest</b> who becomes <b>a butcher,</b> for the first <b>two or three weeks</b> he is <b>exempt from</b> the obligation to give <b>the gifts,</b> as he has not yet established himself in the community as a butcher. But <b>from this</b> point <b>forward</b> he is <b>obligated to</b> give the <b>gifts,</b> as he is now known as a butcher.
Rabbi Tavla <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>And let the Master at least do for</b> the priest <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina</b> and exempt him from giving the gifts for the first three weeks of his partnership. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: This statement</b> of Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina applies only when the priest <b>did not</b> immediately <b>establish a butcher shop.</b> In such a case, the priest is exempt until he becomes known as a recognized butcher. <b>But here, he has</b> already <b>established a butcher shop</b> and is therefore obligated to give the gifts without delay.
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> With regard to <b>a priest who</b> slaughters an animal and <b>does not separate gifts</b> of the priesthood from them for another priest, <b>let him be</b> under the <b>excommunication of the God of Israel. Rabba bar Rav Sheila said: These butchers of</b> the city of <b>Huzal</b> have <b>remained</b> under the <b>excommunication of Rav Ḥisda these</b> last <b>twenty-two years,</b> as they have continuously refused to separate gifts of the priesthood for this period.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> did Rabba bar Rav Sheila state that the butchers of Huzal have been under excommunication for twenty-two years? <b>If we say that we do not excommunicate them</b> for a period <b>any longer</b> than twenty-two years, <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that one is not excommunicated for committing a transgression, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to a prohibition,</b> for which one is liable to receive a relatively severe punishment, e.g., death or <i>karet</i>. <b>But with regard to</b> one who refuses to perform <b>a positive mitzva, e.g.,</b> the court <b>says to him: Perform</b> the mitzva of <b><i>sukka</i>, and he does not do</b> so, or: Perform the mitzva of taking the <b><i>lulav</i>, and he does not do</b> so, or: <b>Prepare ritual fringes</b> for your garments, <b>and he does not do</b> so, the court <b>strikes him</b> an unlimited number of times, even <b>until his soul departs.</b> Accordingly, the butchers of Huzal should remain under excommunication indefinitely until they separate the gifts.
<b>Rather,</b> Rabba bar Rav Sheila means <b>that</b> because the butchers of Huzal have refused to give the gifts for so many years, <b>we fine them</b> even <b>without forewarning.</b> There was a case <b>like this</b> of a person who refused to give the gifts of the priesthood to a priest, <b>where Rava fined</b> him by taking the entire <b>thigh</b> of his animal and giving it to a priest. Similarly, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak fined</b> an individual who refused to give the gifts of the priesthood to a priest by taking his <b>cloak</b> and giving it to a priest.
§ <b>And Rav Ḥisda</b> also <b>says</b> with regard to gifts of the priesthood: The <b>foreleg</b> is given <b>to one</b> priest <b>and</b> the <b>maw</b> is given <b>to one</b> priest, while the <b>jaw</b> is given <b>to two</b> priests. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But when Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef came</b> to Babylonia from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said: In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>we divide</b> the gifts <b>bone by bone,</b> each of which is given to two priests.
The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> in the case dealt with in Eretz Yisrael, the gifts were <b>of a</b> large <b>bull.</b> The Torah states: “That they shall give to the priest” (Deuteronomy 18:3). The use of the term “give” indicates that the gift given should be a substantial one. Even when one limb of the large bull was divided between two priests, each received a substantial portion. This is not the case with regard to the gifts of smaller animals, where each limb is not large enough to provide two substantial portions.
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>prohibited to partake of</b> a slaughtered <b>animal whose gifts have not</b> yet <b>been separated.</b> Furthermore, <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who partakes of an animal whose gifts have not</b> yet <b>been separated</b> is considered <b>as though he consumes untithed produce. But</b> the Gemara states: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
<b>Rav Ḥisda says: Gifts of the priesthood may be consumed only</b> when they are <b>roasted, and they may be consumed only with mustard</b> seasoning. <b>What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? The <b>verse states:</b> “And the Lord spoke to Aaron: And I, behold, I have given you the charge of My gifts; of all the consecrated items of the children of Israel to you have I given them for prominence, and to your sons, as an eternal portion” (Numbers 18:8). The term <b>“for prominence”</b> means that the portions were given to the priests as a mark <b>of greatness.</b> Accordingly, they should be eaten <b>in a manner that kings eat,</b> i.e., roasted and with mustard.
<b>And Rav Ḥisda says: One may not give a gift to any priest who is not an expert in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to all <b>twenty-four gifts of the priesthood.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>But</b> this <b>is not correct, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Any priest who does not believe in</b> the validity of the Temple <b>service has no portion in</b> any of the gifts given to the <b>priesthood, as it is stated: “He among the sons of Aaron, who offers [<i>hamakriv</i>] the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh for a portion”</b> (Leviticus 7:33). The word “<i>hamakriv</i>,” which literally means: Who brings it close, indicates that only one who believes in the validity of conveying the blood to the altar is entitled to receive the right thigh of the offering, as only one who believes in the rite would perform it.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a priest does not have a share in the priestly gifts if he does not believe in <b>this</b> rite of conveying of the blood <b>alone. From where</b> do I derive <b>to include fifteen</b> additional sacrificial <b>rites, such as</b> the rites of a meal offering, i.e., <b>the pouring</b> of the oil <b>and the mixing</b> of the oil and the subsequent pouring of the oil; <b>and the crumbling</b> of meal offerings prepared in a shallow or deep pan or in an oven, whose handfuls are removed after they are baked and subsequently crumbled; <b>and the salting</b> of meal offerings (see Leviticus 2:13); and the <b>waving</b> of certain meal offerings; <b>and the bringing</b> of certain meal offerings to the southwestern corner of the altar before a handful is removed; <b>and the removal of the handful;</b> and <b>the burning</b> of offerings on the altar; <b>and the squeezing</b> of a bird offering to extract its blood; <b>and the pinching</b> of the nape of the neck of a bird offering;

Daf 133a

<b>and</b> the <b>receiving</b> of the blood in a vessel; and its <b>sprinkling</b> upon the altar, each offering according to its <i>halakha</i>; <b>and</b> the <b>giving of water to a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>]; and</b> the ritual of <b>breaking a heifer’s neck</b> in an untilled valley when a corpse is discovered and the murderer is unknown; <b>and</b> the <b>purification of a leper; and</b> the <b>lifting of the hands</b> for the Priestly Benediction, <b>whether inside or outside</b> the Temple; from where are these derived? <b>The verse states: “Among the sons of Aaron,”</b> indicating that this is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to any sacrificial <b>rite that is stated to the sons of Aaron.</b>
<b>And</b> the Gemara explains the proof: The <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>any priest who does not believe in</b> the validity of these rites <b>has no portion in the</b> gifts of the <b>priesthood.</b> It may be inferred that the <b>reason</b> the priest has no portion is <b>that he does not believe in it,</b> whereas if <b>he does believe in it, even though he is not an expert in its</b> <i>halakhot</i>, he receives a portion. This contradicts the opinion of Rav Ḥisda.
With regard to priests who should not be given gifts of the priesthood, <b>Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b>veins that</b> are contained <b>in the jaw</b> of an animal are <b>prohibited</b> for consumption, due to the blood they contain. <b>And one does not give</b> the <b>gift</b> of the jaw <b>to any priest who does not know</b> how <b>to remove</b> the veins, as the priest might eat them.
The Gemara notes: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so,</b> i.e., one need not be concerned that the priest might consume the blood within the veins, as any method of preparing the jaw will remove the blood: <b>If</b> the priest prepares the jaw <b>by roasting</b> it, the blood <b>will drain</b> from the jaw due to the fire. <b>And if</b> he intends <b>to</b> place the jaws in <b>a pot</b> to cook them, <b>if he cuts them and salts them,</b> as one is required to do before cooking any meat, the blood <b>will drain</b> from them, and they will be permitted for consumption.
§ With regard to the manner in which a priest takes gifts of the priesthood from their owners, <b>Rava said: Rav Yosef examined us,</b> his students, with the following question: <b>A priest who seizes gifts</b> of the priesthood from their owners, is <b>he demonstrating fondness</b> for the <b>mitzva or is he demonstrating contempt for the mitzva? And I resolved</b> this question <b>for him</b> from the verse: “That they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). The term <b>“that they shall give”</b> indicates that the owner should give the gifts, <b>and not that</b> a priest <b>should take them by himself.</b> Accordingly, a priest who seizes the gifts from their owners is demonstrating contempt for the mitzva.
<b>Abaye,</b> who was a priest, <b>said: At first, I would seize gifts</b> of the priesthood, as <b>I said</b> to myself that <b>I am demonstrating fondness</b> for the <b>mitzva</b> in this manner. <b>Once I heard this</b> interpretation: <b>“That they shall give,” and not that he should take by himself, I did not seize</b> them anymore. Instead, <b>I would say</b> to the owners of the gifts: <b>Give me. And once I heard that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the sons of Samuel, who were Levites: <b>“But turned aside after wealth”</b> (I Samuel 8:3), and <b>Rabbi Meir says: The sons of Samuel</b> sinned when they <b>asked for their portion,</b> the first tithe given to the Levite, <b>with their mouths,</b> i.e., they demanded that the owners give them the first tithe. Abaye continued: After I heard that, <b>I also did not say</b> anything to the owners, <b>but if they would give me</b> gifts <b>I would take</b> them.
Abaye said further: <b>Once I heard that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the distribution of the shewbread among the priests: <b>The modest ones [<i>hatzenu’im</i>] withdraw their hands</b> and do not take, <b>and the gluttons divide</b> all the bread; <b>I also did not take</b> gifts even when they were offered to me, <b>except for</b> when they were given on <b>the eve of Yom Kippur,</b> when there was an abundance of gifts due to the many animals that were slaughtered, as it is a mitzva to eat that day. In that instance, I took the gifts in order <b>to affirm myself among the priests,</b> i.e., if I would never take gifts then my status as a priest might be called into question.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But let him spread his hands</b> for the Priestly Benediction throughout the year, as this will make it clear to all that he is in fact a priest. The Gemara responds: <b>His schedule constrained him,</b> as he was constantly involved in teaching Torah to his students, so much so that he would miss the time during which the community gathered in the synagogue for the Priestly Benediction.
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> In a case where <b>a priest who has a Torah scholar [<i>tzurva merabbanan</i>]</b> living <b>in his neighborhood and</b> that Torah scholar <b>is hard-pressed</b> for money, <b>let</b> the priest <b>grant</b> his <b>gifts to him,</b> i.e., the priest may declare that those gifts he is destined to receive should be given to the poor Torah scholar. <b>And even though</b> the gifts <b>have not</b> yet <b>come into his possession,</b> he may grant them to the Torah scholar <b>in</b> a case where there are <b>associates of the priesthood and the Levites,</b> i.e., if that specific priest or Levite was well known in his neighborhood and has a standard arrangement with many people that they give him their gifts, as he is certain that he will be given them.
With regard to the statement of Rav Yosef, the Gemara relates that <b>Rava and Rav Safra visited the house of Mar Yoḥana, son of Rav Ḥana bar Adda, and some say</b> they visited <b>the house of Mar Yoḥana, son of Rav Ḥana bar Bizna.</b> Mar Yoḥana <b>prepared for them a third-born calf. Rava said to</b> the <b>attendant</b> of Mar Yoḥana, who was a priest and would normally receive gifts of the priesthood from Mar Yoḥana: <b>Grant us the gifts, as I wish to eat tongue with mustard,</b> and the tongue along with the jaw is one of the gifts.
The attendant <b>granted</b> the gifts <b>to him; Rava ate</b> from them <b>but Rav Safra did not eat.</b> Following this incident, <b>they read</b> the following verse <b>to Rav Safra in a dream: “As one that takes off a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon niter, so is he that sings songs to a heavy heart”</b> (Proverbs 25:20). The verse can be interpreted allegorically as a chastisement of one who studies Torah but fails to understand it.
Rav Safra <b>came before Rav Yosef</b> and <b>said to him: Perhaps because I transgressed the <i>halakha</i> of the Master they read this</b> verse to me in chastisement. Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> No, you acted appropriately by refraining from consuming the gifts. <b>When I said</b> that a priest may grant the gifts to a Torah scholar, that was only <b>with regard to</b> a priest who grants them to <b>another</b> person of his own choosing. I did not permit this in the case of <b>an attendant</b> who grants the gifts to a dignified guest of the homeowner. The reason is that <b>he grants</b> the gifts <b>against his will,</b> as he feels pressured by the homeowner to acquiesce. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>when I said</b> this <i>halakha</i>, it was only <b>for one who cannot</b> eat under another circumstance, as he is hard-pressed for money. In <b>this</b> incident, it was <b>possible for</b> Rava to consume his own meat with mustard, since Rava was not poor.
Rav Safra asked Rav Yosef: <b>But</b> if so, <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>they read this</b> verse to me? Rav Yosef responded: The reading was directed not toward you but <b>toward Rava,</b> who ate from the gifts against my ruling. The Gemara objects: <b>But let them read</b> this verse <b>to Rava</b> himself in a dream. The Gemara responds: <b>Rava was rebuked</b> as a result of this incident and therefore was not granted heavenly communication. The verse was therefore proclaimed to Rav Safra instead.
In the preceding incident, the Gemara related that the verse: “As one that takes off a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon niter, so is he that sings songs to a heavy heart” (Proverbs 25:20), was proclaimed to Rav Safra in a dream. <b>Abaye said to Rav Dimi: And with regard to what</b> matter <b>is the plain meaning of the verse written?</b> Rav Dimi <b>said to him:</b> It is referring <b>to</b> one who <b>teaches an unworthy student.</b> In other words, just as one should remove a worn garment that has no use in cold weather, or just as vinegar upon niter ruins the niter, rendering it unusable, so too, there is no use in singing songs, i.e., teaching Torah, to an unworthy student who has a heavy heart, i.e., who does not intend to adhere to the <i>halakhot</i> he is taught.
<b>As Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: Anyone who teaches</b> Torah <b>to an unworthy student falls into Gehenna, as it is stated: “All darkness is laid up for his treasures; a fire not blown by man shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that remains [<i>yera sarid</i>] in his tent”</b> (Job 20:26), <b>and <i>sarid</i></b> means <b>nothing other than a Torah scholar, as it is stated: “And among the remnant [<i>sarid</i>] those whom the Lord shall call”</b> (Joel 3:5). The word <i>yera</i> shares a root with the word <i>ra</i>, evil, and “<i>yera sarid</i>” is therefore understood to be referring to an unworthy student.
On a similar note, <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav says: Anyone who teaches</b> Torah <b>to an unworthy student</b> is considered <b>like one who throws a stone to Markulis, as it is stated: “As a small stone in a heap of stones, so is he that gives honor to a fool”</b> (Proverbs 26:8), <b>and it is written: “Luxury is not seemly for a fool”</b> (Proverbs 19:10).
§ The mishna teaches that <b>one who enters into partnership with</b> a priest or a gentile <b>must mark</b> the animal. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is one obligated to mark the animal <b>even</b> if he enters into partnership <b>with a gentile? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who enters into partnership with a priest must mark</b> the animal, <b>but one who enters into partnership with a gentile and</b> one who slaughters <b>disqualified consecrated</b> animals <b>does not need to mark</b> the animal.

Daf 133b

The Gemara responds: <b>Here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the <b>gentile is sitting in the butcher shop</b> of the Israelite. In such a situation, it is evident that the gentile is in partnership with the Israelite and the animal need not be marked. By contrast, the mishna is referring to a case where the gentile does not sit in the shop.
The Gemara asks: If so, then <b>in the corresponding</b> situation <b>involving a priest,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> teaches that one who enters into partnership with a priest must mark the animal, this must also be referring to a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>sits in the butcher shop. Why,</b> then, <b>must one mark</b> the animal? The Gemara responds: The fact that the priest sits in the shop does not indicate that he is in partnership with the Israelite, <b>as</b> people will <b>say:</b> He is in the shop because <b>he is purchasing meat.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> then in the case of the <b>gentile as well, they</b> will <b>say</b> that he is in the shop because <b>he is purchasing meat.</b>
<b>Rather, here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where the gentile sits by the safe</b> into which the butcher places money received from his customers. In such a situation, it is evident that the gentile is in partnership with the Israelite, and therefore the animal need not be marked. The Gemara asks: If so, then <b>the corresponding</b> situation in the <i>baraita</i> <b>involving a priest</b> must also be a case <b>where</b> the priest <b>sits by the safe. Why,</b> then, <b>must one mark</b> the animal? The Gemara responds: The fact that the priest sits by the safe does not indicate that he is in partnership with the Israelite, <b>as</b> people will <b>say:</b> The butcher <b>trusts him</b> to protect the safe from theft. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then in the case of the <b>gentile as well, they</b> will <b>say</b> that he sits by the safe because the butcher <b>trusts him.</b>
The Gemara responds: It is <b>not</b> common for a Jew to place his <b>trust in a gentile. If you wish, say</b> instead that in both cases of the <i>baraita</i> the priest and the gentile sit in the butcher shop, not by the safe. It is evident that the gentile is in partnership with the Israelite, as <b>an ordinary gentile</b> partner <b>yells</b> at the seller, saying, for example: Do not sell an item for this price but for a different price. By contrast, a priest, even if he sits in the shop, would not question the practices of the salesman, due to his modesty, but would defer to the seller’s expertise. Accordingly, it is not evident that the priest is a partner, and the animal must therefore be marked.
§ <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> the owner of <b>disqualified consecrated</b> animals, which were slaughtered after they were redeemed and became non-sacred, is exempt from the obligation to give the gifts, and one <b>does not need to mark</b> the animal. The Gemara objects: <b>Apparently, it is an evident matter</b> that this is a disqualified consecrated animal, and therefore one need not mark it. <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 31a): All <b>disqualified consecrated</b> animals <b>are sold in the meat market [<i>be’itliz</i>], and are slaughtered in the meat market, and are weighed</b> and sold <b>by the <i>litra</i>,</b> in the manner of non-sacred meat? Since disqualified consecrated animals are treated in the same manner as ordinary non-sacred animals, how is it evident that this is a disqualified consecrated animal?
The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava interpreted</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Pappa</b> as referring <b>to those</b> disqualified consecrated animals <b>that are sold</b> from <b>inside the house,</b> i.e., a firstborn animal and an animal tithe, whose redemption payments belong to their owners, as their value has no sanctity. Since no gain would accrue to the Temple, the Sages prohibited one from selling these animals in the market, despite the fact one could have obtained a higher sale price there due to the high concentration of customers.
§ With regard to gifts of the priesthood from animals owned in partnership, <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If an Israelite is <b>a partner</b> with a priest or gentile <b>in</b> only <b>the head</b> of the animal, he is <b>exempt</b> merely <b>from</b> the obligation to give the <b>jaw,</b> which is part of the head. He remains obligated to give the foreleg and the maw. If he is <b>a partner</b> with a priest or gentile <b>in the leg and hoof</b> of the animal, he is <b>exempt</b> only <b>from</b> the obligation to give <b>the foreleg.</b> If he is <b>a partner</b> with a priest or gentile <b>in the innards,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> merely <b>from</b> the obligation to give <b>the maw. And Ḥiyya bar Rav says</b> that <b>even</b> if the priest or gentile is <b>a partner in</b> only <b>one of them,</b> the Israelite is <b>exempt from all of</b> the gifts.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Ḥiyya bar Rav from a <i>baraita</i>: If a priest says to an Israelite butcher: Let us enter into a partnership in which <b>the head</b> of the animal <b>is mine and the entire</b> remainder <b>is yours, even</b> if the priest proposes that only <b>one-hundredth of the head</b> should be his, the Israelite is <b>exempt.</b> Similarly, if the priest offers: Let us enter into a partnership in which <b>the leg and hoof</b> of the animal <b>are mine and the entire</b> remainder <b>is yours, even</b> if the priest suggests that only <b>one-hundredth of the leg and hoof</b> will be his, the Israelite is <b>exempt.</b> And likewise, if the priest says: Let us enter into a partnership in which <b>the innards</b> of the animal <b>are mine and the entire</b> remainder <b>is yours, even</b> if the priest offers to take only <b>one-hundredth of the innards,</b> the Israelite is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>What, is it not</b> correct that the <i>baraita</i> is teaching that when the priest owns the head the butcher is <b>exempt from</b> giving <b>the jaw, but obligated in</b> giving <b>all</b> the rest, and likewise when the priest owns the leg and hoof, he is <b>exempt from</b> giving <b>the foreleg but obligated in all</b> the rest, and when the priest owns the innards, he is <b>exempt from the maw and obligated in all</b> the rest? This would contradict the opinion of Ḥiyya bar Rav. The Gemara responds: <b>No;</b> in each case the <i>baraita</i> means that he is <b>exempt from all</b> the gifts.
The Gemara suggests: <b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> explicitly that he is <b>exempt from all the</b> gifts, rather than simply stating that he is exempt. <b>And furthermore,</b> it <b>is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that if a priest says to an Israelite butcher: Let us enter into a partnership in which <b>the head</b> of the animal <b>is mine and the entire</b> remainder <b>is yours, even</b> if the priest suggests that only <b>one-hundredth of the head</b> will be his, the butcher is <b>exempt from</b> the obligation to give <b>the jaw but is obligated in</b> giving <b>all the</b> rest. This <i>baraita</i> explicitly contradicts the opinion of Ḥiyya bar Rav. The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav</b> is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> in explanation of the opinion of Ḥiyya bar Rav: <b>This <i>baraita</i> misled Ḥiyya bar Rav, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There are twenty-four gifts of the priesthood, and all of them were given</b> in the Torah <b>to Aaron and his sons by a generalization and a detail, and</b> with <b>a covenant of salt.</b> The verse states: “And the Lord spoke to Aaron: And I, behold, I have given you the charge of My gifts; of all the consecrated items of the children of Israel to you have I given them for prominence, and to your sons, as an eternal portion” (Numbers 18:8). After this generalization, the Torah proceeds to list the gifts in detail. Finally, after delineating all the gifts of the priesthood, the verse states: “It is an everlasting covenant of salt” (Numbers 18:19), assuring Aaron that just as a covenant of salt is unbreakable, so too, the gifts of the priesthood are eternal.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Therefore, <b>anyone who fulfills</b> the mitzva of giving the gifts of the priesthood is considered <b>as though he fulfills</b> all these mitzvot that are derived using the principle of <b>a generalization and a detail, and</b> as though he has upheld the <b>covenant of salt. And anyone who violates</b> the mitzva of giving the gifts of the priesthood is considered <b>as though he violates</b> all of the mitzvot derived by the principle of <b>a generalization and a detail, and</b> as though he has not upheld the <b>covenant of salt.</b>
<b>And these are</b> the twenty-four gifts: <b>Ten</b> are consumed <b>in the Temple, and four in Jerusalem, and ten in the boundaries</b> of Eretz Yisrael. The <b>ten</b> gifts consumed only <b>in the Temple</b> are an animal <b>sin offering; and a bird sin offering;</b> and <b>a definite guilt offering; and a provisional guilt offering; and communal peace offerings,</b> i.e., the lambs that accompany the two loaves brought on <i>Shavuot</i> and which are considered offerings of the most sacred order; <b>and</b> the remainder of <b>the <i>log</i> of oil</b> that accompanies the guilt offering of a recovered <b>leper; and the two loaves</b> offering from the new wheat brought on <i>Shavuot</i>; <b>and the shewbread; and the leftovers of meal offerings; and the <i>omer</i> meal offering,</b> i.e., the measure of barley brought as a communal offering on the sixteenth of Nisan.
<b>And</b> these are the <b>four</b> gifts that the priests consume anywhere <b>in Jerusalem: The</b> unblemished <b>firstborn</b> of kosher animals; <b>and the first fruits; and the</b> portions <b>separated</b> for the priests <b>from the thanks offering,</b> i.e., the breast and thigh and one loaf from each of the four types of loaves brought with a thanks offerings: Cakes, wafers, cakes of fine flour, and leavened bread, <b>and</b> the portions separated <b>from the nazirite’s ram,</b> i.e., the boiled shoulder, a cake, and a wafer, in addition to the breast and thigh of any peace offering; <b>and</b> the <b>hides of sacrificial</b> animals brought as burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings.
<b>And</b> these are the <b>ten</b> gifts that the priests consume anywhere <b>in the boundaries</b> of Eretz Yisrael: <b><i>Teruma</i>,</b> i.e., the portion of the produce designated for the priest; <b>and <i>teruma</i> of the tithe; and <i>ḥalla</i>; and the first sheared</b> wool; <b>and the gifts</b> of the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw; <b>and</b> the five <i>sela</i> given as <b>redemption of</b> the firstborn <b>son; and</b> a sheep or goat given as <b>redemption of the firstborn donkey.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues the list: <b>And a</b> consecrated <b>ancestral field</b> that one did not redeem, which was sold to another by the Temple treasurer and is therefore given to the members of the priestly watch serving during the Jubilee Year; <b>and a dedicated field; and</b> payment for the <b>robbery of a convert</b> who died without heirs. If one takes an oath that he did not rob from a convert, and after the death of the convert he admits to having taken a false oath, he must pay the principal value of the stolen item and an additional one-fifth of the value, all of which is given to the priests.
Rav Ḥisda explains how the <i>baraita</i> misled Ḥiyya bar Rav: <b>He thought</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>counts the gifts</b> of the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw <b>as one</b> gift, <b>they are</b> treated as <b>one</b> gift, which means that if one is exempt from one of them he is exempt from all of them. <b>But it is not so,</b> as <b>is that to say</b> that <b>the</b> portions <b>separated</b> for the priests <b>from the thanks offering and</b> from <b>the nazirite’s ram, which</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>counts as one,</b> are counted this way <b>because they are one?</b> Obviously, these are independent gifts. <b>Rather, since they are similar to one another</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>counts them as one. So too,</b> with regard to the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw, <b>since they are similar to one another he counts them as one.</b>
§ With regard to animals owned in partnership with a priest, the Gemara relates that <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a priest says to an Israelite butcher: Let us enter into partnership in ownership of a live animal, in which <b>the head is yours and the entire</b> remainder <b>is mine, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the Israelite obligated to give the jaw to a priest when it is slaughtered? The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: Do <b>we follow the obligation,</b> i.e., the limbs of the animal which contain the gifts, <b>and</b> since <b>the obligation is</b> owned <b>by the Israelite</b> he is obligated? <b>Or perhaps, we follow the principal</b> part of the <b>animal, and</b> since <b>the principal</b> of the <b>animal is</b> in the possession <b>of the priest,</b> the Israelite is exempt?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a gentile or a priest who transferred his sheep to an Israelite</b> to act as his agent <b>to shear</b> it, the Israelite is <b>exempt</b> from giving the first sheared wool to a priest. Similarly, <b>one who purchases</b> the <b>shearing</b> of the <b>sheep of a gentile,</b> even before the sheep was actually sheared, is <b>exempt from</b> giving <b>the first sheared</b> wool.
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And this,</b> the <i>halakha</i> in a case where one purchases an item before the obligation of a certain gift of the priesthood takes effect, <b>is a stringency</b> that applies <b>in</b> the case of <b>the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw more so than</b> in the case of the <b>first sheared</b> wool. In other words, one who purchases wool from a priest before it is shorn is exempt from giving first sheared wool, whereas one who purchases part of an animal from a priest before its slaughter is obligated to give any gifts contained within the purchased portion. Since this is the <i>halakha</i> even if the portion he purchased is not the principal part, similar to the stated case of one who purchases only the shearing of the sheep of a gentile, one can <b>conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that <b>we follow the obligation,</b> i.e., the limbs of the animal that contain the gifts. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from it</b> that this is correct.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And if</b> a priest sold his animal to an Israelite and <b>said</b> that he is selling everything <b>except for the gifts</b> with it, the Israelite is <b>exempt from</b> the obligation to give <b>the gifts,</b> because they are not his.

Daf 134a

The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If a priest sells his animal to an Israelite and stipulates: I am selling it <b>on the condition that the gifts are mine,</b> the Israelite is not obligated to give the gifts to that priest. Rather, he <b>gives</b> the gifts <b>to any priest that he wants.</b> Since the priest sold his animal, the priest cannot issue a condition involving the gifts, as they no longer belong to him but to the entire tribe of priests. The <i>baraita</i> indicates that the Israelite is nevertheless obligated to give the gifts, which apparently contradicts the ruling of the mishna.
The Gemara responds: Do <b>you raise a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that discusses a case where the priest states: <b>On the condition</b> that the gifts are mine, <b>with regard to</b> the case of the mishna, where the priest states: <b>Except</b> for the gifts? That is not a contradiction, as the word <b>except</b> is a term of <b>retention,</b> i.e., the priest retains the gifts and does not sell them to the Israelite. By contrast, the term: <b>On the condition,</b> is <b>not</b> one of <b>retention,</b> as the priest does not keep the gifts for himself but instead stipulates that the buyer must give the gifts to him. The priest is not authorized to issue such a stipulation and it is therefore disregarded entirely, and because the Israelite owns the gifts he must give them to a priest.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> one may <b>raise a contradiction</b> against the previous <i>baraita</i> from another <i>baraita</i>: If a priest sells his animal to an Israelite and stipulates: I am selling it <b>on the condition that the gifts are mine, the gifts are his</b> and the Israelite must give the gifts to that priest. The Gemara responds: There is a dispute between the <i>tanna’im</i> of these <i>baraitot</i>, and <b>they disagree with regard to this</b> matter: One <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that the term: <b>On the condition, is</b> one of <b>retention,</b> and the priest therefore retains possession of the gifts. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that: <b>On the condition, is not</b> a term of <b>retention,</b> and the priest is not authorized to stipulate that the buyer must give the gifts to him.
§ The mishna teaches that if one <b>said to</b> a butcher: <b>Sell me the innards</b> of a cow that you slaughtered, and there were gifts, i.e., the maw, included with it, the buyer gives the gifts to the priest and does not deduct its value from the money that he pays to the butcher. If he bought the innards by weight, the buyer gives the maw to the priest and deducts its value from the money he pays to the butcher. With regard to innards purchased by weight, <b>Rav says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that the buyer gives the maw to the priest <b>only when</b> the buyer <b>weighed</b> the innards <b>for himself</b> when purchasing them. In such a case, the priest claims the maw from the buyer. <b>But</b> if the <b>butcher weighed</b> the innards <b>for</b> the buyer, <b>the judgment is</b> also <b>with the butcher,</b> i.e., the priest may claim the maw from either the butcher or the buyer. <b>And Rav Asi says: Even</b> if the <b>butcher weighed</b> the innards <b>for</b> the buyer, <b>the judgment is with</b> the buyer alone.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> a statement <b>of Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda said:</b> In a case where one <b>robbed</b> another of an item, <b>and the owners had not despaired of retrieving</b> it, <b>and another</b> person <b>came and consumed</b> the stolen item, if the owner <b>wants, he</b> may <b>collect</b> the value of the stolen item <b>from this one,</b> the robber, and if he <b>wants, he</b> may <b>collect from that one</b> who consumed it. The suggestion is <b>that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b> and he therefore holds that the priest may claim the maw from either the buyer or the butcher; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Asi, <b>does not hold</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b> and the priest may therefore claim the maw from the buyer alone.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No; everyone holds</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda, and here they disagree with regard to</b> whether or not <b>gifts of the priesthood can be stolen. As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that they <b>can be stolen,</b> and accordingly the robber remains responsible for them even if they are consumed by another. Consequently, if the butcher weighed the innards, the priest may claim the gifts from either the butcher or the buyer. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Asi, <b>holds</b> that gifts of the priesthood <b>cannot be stolen.</b> Since technically one cannot steal the gifts, the obligation to return them to the priest rests solely on the one in physical possession of them. Accordingly, the priest may claim the gifts from the buyer alone, as the gifts are in his custody.
The Gemara notes that <b>some teach this <i>halakha</i>,</b> that there is a dispute between Rav and Rav Asi as to whether or not gifts of the priesthood can be stolen, <b>by itself,</b> i.e., as an independent dispute between them rather than in explanation of another dispute: <b>Rav says</b> that <b>gifts of the priesthood can be stolen, and Rav Asi says</b> that <b>gifts of the priesthood cannot be stolen.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a convert who converted and he had a cow,</b> if the cow <b>was slaughtered before</b> he <b>converted,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from giving the gifts to the priest. If the animal was slaughtered <b>after he converted,</b> the convert is <b>obligated</b> to give the gifts. If there is <b>uncertainty</b> whether it was slaughtered before or after the conversion, the convert is <b>exempt, as the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if there is an uncertainty whether an individual is obligated to give gifts of the priesthood, he is exempt from giving them. In this regard, the Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish raised a contradiction to Rabbi Yoḥanan: We learned</b> in the mishna that when there is <b>an uncertainty</b> one is <b>exempt</b> from giving the gifts. <b>Evidently,</b> in cases of <b>uncertainty</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to</b> be <b>lenient.</b>
But one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from that which is taught in another mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 4:11) with regard to gleanings left for the poor: In a case of grain found in <b>ant holes that are inside the standing</b> crop in an area of the field that was not harvested, <b>these are</b> the property <b>of the owner</b> of the field, as this grain does not have the status of gleanings. <b>And</b> in the case of grain found in ant holes <b>that are behind the harvesters</b> in an already harvested area, <b>the upper</b> wheat stalks, i.e., those stalks found at the mouth of the holes, belong <b>to the poor,</b> as they are assumed to be gleanings that fell from the bundles when that area was harvested, <b>and the lower</b> wheat inside the holes are the property <b>of the owner,</b> since it is possible that they were collected by the ants before the harvest and are not gleanings.
<b>Rabbi Meir says: Everything</b> goes <b>to the poor, as</b> grain whose status as <b>gleanings</b> is <b>uncertain</b> is considered <b>gleanings.</b> According to Rabbi Meir, the <i>halakha</i> is stringent in the case of an uncertainty with regard to gifts left for the poor. This apparently contradicts the mishna’s statement that one is lenient in the case of an uncertainty with regard to gifts of the priesthood, as these gifts are similar in this regard to gifts left for the poor. Since any unattributed mishna is considered to be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, this is apparently a contradiction with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Meir.
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: <b>Do not trouble me</b> with this contradiction, <b>as I teach</b> that <i>baraita</i> <b>in the singular,</b> i.e., it is not certain that this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir; rather, it is merely the claim of one Sage that this is Rabbi Meir’s opinion. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra says in the name of Rabbi Meir:</b> Grain whose status as <b>gleanings</b> is <b>uncertain</b> is considered <b>gleanings;</b> grain whose status as <b>forgotten</b> sheaves is <b>uncertain</b> is considered <b>forgotten</b> sheaves; and grain whose status as <b><i>pe’a</i></b> is <b>uncertain</b> is considered <b><i>pe’a</i>.</b> Therefore, one should not raise a contradiction to the mishna from the statement of a single Sage claiming to represent the opinion of Rabbi Meir.
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: Even if <b>you teach that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>only in a language</b> whereby a certain imbecile named <b>ben Tedal</b> states that this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir, a question remains, as <b>isn’t</b> there <b>a stated reason</b> for stringency in cases of uncertainties with regard to gifts left for the poor? <b>As Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Do justice to the afflicted and destitute”</b> (Psalms 82:3)? Specifically, <b>what is</b> the meaning of <b>“do justice”?</b>
<b>If we say</b> that it means that one should do justice <b>in judgments,</b> i.e., a judge should sway judgments in favor of the afflicted and destitute, <b>but isn’t it written: “Neither shall you favor a poor man in his cause”</b> (Exodus 23:3)? <b>Rather,</b> the verse is teaching that in cases of uncertainty with regard to gifts left for the poor, <b>be righteous with that which is yours and give it to</b> the poor. Why, then, is the <i>halakha</i> stringent in the case of gifts left for the poor but lenient with regard to gifts to priests?
<b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>Here,</b> in the case of gifts of the priesthood, the <i>halakha</i> is lenient because the <b>cow</b> of a convert <b>maintains</b> the <b>presumptive status of exemption,</b> as the obligation of the gifts did not apply to the cow before the convert converted. By contrast, the <i>halakha</i> is stringent in the case of the gifts left for the poor, as the <b>standing</b> crop <b>maintains</b> the <b>presumptive status of obligation.</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>dough</b> of a convert, the <i>halakha</i> is that if <b>it was prepared before he converted</b> he is <b>exempt from</b> separating <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> from this dough, and if it was prepared <b>after he converted,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to separate <i>ḥalla</i> from it. And if there is an <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether the dough was prepared before or after his conversion, he is <b>obligated,</b> despite the fact that dough prepared by a gentile is exempt from <i>ḥalla</i>. Why isn’t the convert exempt from separating <i>ḥalla</i> just as he is exempt from giving gifts of the priesthood in the case of an uncertainty, as both the dough and the cow maintain a presumptive status of exemption?
Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: There is a difference between <i>ḥalla</i> and gifts of the priesthood. Although the dough maintains the presumptive status of exemption, here there is also uncertainty with regard to a prohibition, as a non-priest who consumes <i>ḥalla</i> is liable to receive the punishment of death at the hand of Heaven. And whenever there is <b>an uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>a prohibition,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to</b> be <b>stringent.</b> Conversely, uncertainties with regard to gifts of the priesthood involve no prohibition and are strictly monetary, and whenever there is <b>an uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>monetary matters,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to</b> be <b>lenient.</b> Consequently, one relies on the presumptive status of exemption in the case of a cow, and the convert is exempt from giving the gifts to the priest.
<b>As Rav Ḥisda said, and Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches likewise: Eight</b> instances of <b>uncertainties were stated with regard to the convert;</b> in <b>four</b> instances the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> there is <b>an obligation, and</b> in the other <b>four</b> instances the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> there is <b>an exemption.</b> These are the four instances where the <i>halakha</i> is stringent: The first is an uncertainty with regard to the <b>offering of</b> one’s <b>wife</b> who gave birth, where it is uncertain whether she gave birth before her conversion and she is exempt from bringing an offering, or after her conversion and she is obligated. This case involves a prohibition, as a woman who does not bring her atonement offering is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for consuming sanctified items.
<b>And</b> the second case is an uncertainty with regard to the obligation to separate <b><i>ḥalla</i></b> from his dough, which also involves a prohibition, as explained above. <b>And</b> the third case is an uncertainty with regard to a male <b>firstborn non-kosher animal,</b> i.e., a firstborn donkey, where it is uncertain if it was born before or after the owner’s conversion, which involves the prohibition against deriving benefit from it before its redemption. <b>And</b> the fourth case of an uncertainty is with regard to a male <b>firstborn of a kosher animal,</b> where it is uncertain if it was born before or after the owner’s conversion, where one can be liable to receive <i>karet</i> for slaughtering it outside the Temple courtyard. In these four cases, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> there is <b>an obligation.</b>

Daf 134b

And these are the four uncertainties with regard to a convert where the <i>halakha</i> is lenient: The first is an uncertainty with regard to <b>the first sheared</b> wool of one’s sheep, where it is uncertain whether they were shorn before or after his conversion. <b>And</b> the second is whether or not the obligation of giving <b>the gifts</b> of the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw applies to his animal. <b>And</b> the third is an uncertainty with regard to the obligation to give five <i>sela</i> for the mitzva of the <b>redemption of</b> the firstborn <b>son,</b> where it is uncertain if he was born before or after the owner’s conversion. <b>And</b> the last is an uncertainty with regard to the <b>redemption of a firstborn donkey</b> by means of a sheep or a goat, where it is uncertain if it was born before or after the owner’s conversion. In each of these instances, the uncertainty is only with regard to monetary matters, and therefore the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> one is <b>exempt.</b>
In connection to the previous discussion between Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan, the Gemara relates that <b>when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> a slightly different version of the above discussion: Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>raised</b> the <b>contradiction</b> to the opinion of Rabbi Meir from a <i>baraita</i> that states that Rabbi Meir exempts the <b>standing</b> crop of a convert from the obligation to leave gleanings for the poor when it is uncertain whether the crop was harvested before or after his conversion. This <i>baraita</i> is in contradiction <b>to</b> the <i>baraita</i> that likewise discusses the <b>standing</b> crop: Grain whose status as gleanings is uncertain is considered gleanings. Rabbi Yoḥanan resolved this contradiction by explaining that the second <i>baraita</i> is the opinion of Rabbi Meir only according to Rabbi Yehuda ben Agra.
§ With regard to gifts left for the poor, the Gemara relates that <b>Levi sowed</b> crops in his field <b>in Kishar, but there were no poor</b> people in Kishar <b>to take gleanings</b> from his field. Levi <b>came before Rav Sheshet</b> to ask what should be done with the gleanings. Rav Sheshet <b>said to him:</b> The verse states with regard to the mitzvot of <i>pe’a</i> and gleanings: <b>“You shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger”</b> (Leviticus 23:22), <b>and not for the ravens nor for the bats.</b> Since there are no poor people to take the gleanings, you should take them for yourself.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The owner of a field <b>does not</b> need to expend the effort to <b>bring <i>teruma</i>, neither from the threshing floor to the city nor from the wilderness to a settled area,</b> in order to give it to a priest. Rather, the priest must travel to the field to receive the <i>teruma</i>. <b>And if there is no priest there,</b> at the threshing floor or in the wilderness, to receive the <i>teruma</i>, the owner must <b>hire a cow and bring</b> the <i>teruma</i> to the city, <b>due to</b> the <b>loss of <i>teruma</i></b> that would occur if it were left in the field. According to this <i>baraita</i>, the owner of the field should likewise be obligated to do the same with gleanings.
The Gemara explains: <b><i>Teruma</i> is different,</b> in <b>that</b> if it is not separated <b>it</b> causes the entire crop to be considered <b>untithed, and</b> it is therefore <b>not possible for</b> one <b>not</b> to <b>separate</b> <i>teruma</i> from the crop. By contrast, gleanings do not render the remaining crop prohibited for consumption, and therefore it is not necessary to set them aside and remove them.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> what about the case of the <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood, <b>which do not render</b> the rest of the animal <b>untithed,</b> i.e., they do not prohibit the entire animal in consumption before they are separated. <b>And</b> nevertheless <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a <b>place where they were accustomed to put the</b> meat of slaughtered <b>calves in boiling water</b> in order to remove the hairs from the skin, and then eat the meat with the skin still attached to the flesh, one <b>may not skin the foreleg</b> before giving it to the priest. Rather, he gives it with its skin intact.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Similarly, in a place where people are accustomed <b>to skin the head</b> of an animal, one <b>may not skin the</b> cheek of the <b>jaw</b> of an animal before giving it to the priest, but must give it with its skin intact so that the priest may use the skin as he wishes. <b>And if there is no priest</b> available to receive the gifts, the gifts are <b>appraised</b> by their <b>monetary</b> value, <b>and</b> the owner may <b>eat them</b> and gives their monetary value to a priest at the next available time, <b>due to</b> the <b>loss</b> that would otherwise be incurred by the <b>priest.</b> Evidently, one must expend effort to ensure that a priest receives the gifts despite the fact that they do not render the entire animal untithed. Why is the <i>halakha</i> different with regard to gleanings?
The Gemara responds: The <i>halakha</i> <b>is different</b> in the case of <b>gifts of the priesthood, as</b> a term of <b>giving is written with regard to it:</b> “That they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). This teaches that one must actively give the gifts to a priest, whereas no equivalent term is written with regard to gleanings. The Gemara adds: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> explanation with regard to gifts of the priesthood, one can likewise explain that the reason <b><i>teruma</i></b> must be brought to a locale where there is a priest is <b>likewise</b> due to the fact that a term of <b>giving is written with regard to it:</b> “The first fruits of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the first sheared wool of your sheep you shall give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), not because <i>teruma</i> renders the crop untithed.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse to state <b>an extra</b> term of <b>leaving</b> with regard to gleanings? One verse states: “Neither shall you gather the gleaning of your harvest, and your vineyard you shall not harvest completely, and the fallen fruit of your vineyard you shall not gather; you shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger” (Leviticus 19:9–10), and another verse states: “Neither shall you gather the gleaning of your harvest; you shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger” (Leviticus 23:22). Doesn’t this additional mention of leaving indicate that even if there are no poor people to take the gleanings, the owner must collect them and ensure that a poor person can claim them?
The Gemara responds: No, the extra term of leaving is required <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who declares his vineyard ownerless, and in the morning awoke</b> and reclaimed the ownerless vineyard <b>and harvested</b> the grapes, he <b>is obligated in</b> the mitzva of leaving <b>individual fallen</b> grapes for the poor [<i>peret</i>], <b>and in</b> the mitzva of leaving <b>incompletely formed clusters</b> of grapes for the poor [<i>olelot</i>], <b>and in</b> the mitzva of leaving <b>forgotten</b> clusters, <b>and in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>pe’a</i>. And he is exempt from</b> the obligation to separate <b>the tithes</b> from the grapes, as the vineyard had been ownerless. The <i>baraita</i> rules that he is obligated in the gifts for the poor despite the <i>halakha</i> that the obligation to leave these gifts does not apply to an ownerless vineyard. It is derived from the additional mention of leaving that the obligation of gifts to the poor applies even to an ownerless field of this type.
§ In relation to the discussion of a case where the owner of a field takes gifts left for the poor for himself, the Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain sack of dinars that was brought to the study hall</b> to provide financial assistance for the students. <b>Rabbi Ami rushed and acquired them.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how can he act in this</b> manner? <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to gifts of the priesthood: <b>“That they shall give</b> to the priest” (Deuteronomy 18:3), and the Sages derived from the verse that a priest should receive the gifts <b>and he should not take</b> them <b>by himself.</b> The same applies to gifts for the poor as well. The Gemara responds: <b>Rabbi Ami too</b> did not take the gifts for himself. Rather, <b>he acquired them for the poor.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a distinguished person</b> such as Rabbi Ami, who was the head of the yeshiva, <b>is different,</b> and he may acquire the gifts for himself. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: <b>“And the priest who is greater than his brethren”</b> (Leviticus 21:10), indicates <b>that</b> the High Priest <b>should be greater than his</b> priestly <b>brethren in beauty, in wisdom, and in wealth.</b>
<b>Others say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the High Priest <b>does not have</b> property of his own, <b>his brethren the priests elevate him</b> and render him wealthy from their own property? <b>The verse states: “And the priest who is greater than his brethren,”</b> i.e., they must <b>elevate him from</b> the property <b>of his brethren.</b> Since the members of the study hall are required to enrich Rabbi Ami from their own property, it is certainly permitted for him to take these gifts for himself.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>What is the</b> definition of the <b>foreleg</b> that is given to the priests as one of the gifts? It is the part of the leg <b>from the joint of the</b> lower <b>knee until the rounded protrusion</b> surrounding the thigh bone <b>of the foreleg; and that is</b> the foreleg mentioned in the Torah <b>with regard to the nazirite:</b> “And the priest shall take the foreleg of the ram when it is cooked” (Numbers 6:19). <b>And the parallel in the hind leg is the thigh</b> that is given to the priest from the peace offering, which is also from the joint of the lower knee until the rounded protrusion surrounding the thigh bone. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The <b>thigh is from the joint of the</b> lower <b>knee until the upper knee</b> joint, which connects the middle and upper parts of the leg. <b>What is the</b> definition of the <b>jaw?</b> It is <b>from the joint of the</b> lower <b>jaw</b> beneath the temples and downward <b>until the upper ring of the windpipe.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the gifts of the priesthood: “That they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). <b>“The foreleg”; this is</b> the <b>right foreleg</b> of the animal. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that <b>this is</b> the <b>right foreleg, or is it only the left foreleg? The verse states: “The foreleg.”</b> The definite article indicates that the verse is referring to the right foreleg.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> for this, i.e., how is it understood from the definite article that the verse is referring to the right foreleg? The Gemara responds: It is derived <b>like that</b> which <b>Rava said</b> with regard to the verse: “Therefore the children of Israel do not eat the sciatic nerve which is upon the hollow of <b>the thigh”</b> (Genesis 32:33). The definite article indicates that this is referring to <b>the most important thigh. Here too,</b> the definite article in the term <b>“the foreleg”</b> indicates that the verse is referring to <b>the most important foreleg,</b> i.e., the right foreleg.
The Gemara continues: And in the term <b>“and the jaw,” for what</b> purpose <b>does</b> the definite article <b>come,</b> i.e., what <i>halakha</i> does it teach? It serves <b>to include wool that is on the head of lambs and hair that is in the beard of goats</b> in the obligation to give the jaw to the priest. And in the term <b>“and the maw,” for what</b> purpose <b>does</b> the definite article <b>come?</b> It serves <b>to include fat that is on the maw and fat that is inside the maw</b> in the obligation to give the maw to the priest. <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua said: Priests behaved generously with</b> fat that is on the maw <b>and they gave it to</b> its <b>owner,</b> i.e., they relinquished their right to receive it. The Gemara infers: The <b>reason</b> this fat was not given to the priests is <b>that they behaved</b> generously, <b>but</b> had they <b>not behaved</b> generously, the fat would be <b>his,</b> the priest’s.
The Gemara cites a homiletical idea with regard to the gifts of the priesthood: <b>The interpreters</b> of Torah <b>symbolism [<i>dorshei ḥamurot</i>] would say</b> with regard to the reason why the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw are given to the priests: <b>The foreleg corresponds to the hand</b> of Pinehas, son of Elazar the priest, who killed Zimri, son of Salu, thereby bringing an end to the plague that was ravaging the children of Israel. <b>And it likewise states</b> in the verse: <b>“And he took a spear in his hand”</b> (Numbers 25:7).
<b>And</b> the <b>jaw</b> corresponds to the <b>prayer [<i>tefilla</i>]</b> offered by Pinehas during the aforementioned incident. <b>And so it states</b> in the verse: <b>“Then stood up Pinehas, and wrought judgment [<i>vayefallel</i>],</b> and so the plague was stayed. And that was counted to him for righteousness, to all generations forever” (Psalms 106:30). The <b>maw</b> is <b>as its plain meaning</b> in the verses describing the incident, <b>and it likewise states:</b> “And he thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, <b>and the woman through her belly.</b> So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel” (Numbers 25:8).
The Gemara above cited a source for the <i>halakha</i> that the right foreleg is given to the priest. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the following <i>baraita</i> <b>cites</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>from here:</b> The verse states with regard to the gift to the priest from a peace offering: “And <b>the right thigh</b> you shall give to the priest as a gift from your sacrifices of peace offerings” (Leviticus 7:32). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>the right thigh</b> of a peace offering is given to the priest. <b>From where</b> do I derive that the right <b>foreleg</b> of the <b>sacrificial</b> ram of the nazirite is given to the priest? <b>The verse states:</b> “You shall give to the priest as <b>a gift.”</b> And <b>from where</b> is it derived that the right <b>foreleg</b> of <b>a non-sacred</b> animal is also given as a gift to the priest? <b>The verse states: “You shall give.”</b>
§ The mishna taught: <b>What is</b> definition of <b>the jaw?</b> It is <b>from the joint of the jaw</b> beneath the temples and below <b>until the upper ring of the windpipe.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when one removes the jaw from the animal to give to the priest, <b>he removes it and the area of slaughter</b> on the throat <b>with it?</b> The area of slaughter is beyond the upper ring of the windpipe.
The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult.</b> Everyone agrees that the priest receives only the part until the upper ring of the windpipe, and the difference between the two rulings is that <b>this</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and that</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus.</b>
The Gemara explains that this is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The slaughter of an animal in such a manner that the knife is <b>diverted</b> to an area above the place of slaughter on its throat is <b>not valid. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus testified with regard to</b> the slaughter of an animal when the knife is <b>diverted that it is valid</b> (see 18b). The <i>baraita</i> calls the area of the jaw until the upper ring of the windpipe the area of slaughter, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Antigonus, who maintains that it is also a valid area for slaughter.
And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this</b> mishna <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are both in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and what</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it says: <b>With it?</b> It means that the area of slaughter remains <b>with the animal,</b> i.e., it remains with the owner and is not given to the priest.

Daf 135a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool</b> that every Jew must give to the priest, as stated in the verse: “And the first sheared wool of your flock [<i>tzonekha</i>] shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), <b>applies</b> both <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>in the presence of the Temple and not in the presence of the Temple,</b> and <b>with regard to non-sacred</b> animals. <b>But</b> it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to sacrificial</b> animals.
There are more <b>stringent</b> elements <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw</b> (see 130a) <b>than</b> in the <i>halakha</i> of <b>the first sheared wool</b> in <b>that</b> the mitzva of <b>the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw applies to cattle and to sheep,</b> as it is written: “Whether it be ox or sheep, that he shall give unto the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3); and it applies <b>to numerous</b> animals <b>and to few</b> animals. <b>But</b> by contrast, the mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool applies only to sheep</b> and not to goats and cattle, <b>and applies only to numerous</b> animals.
<b>And how many are numerous? Beit Shammai say:</b> It is at least <b>two sheep, as it is stated: “That a man shall rear a young cow, and two sheep [<i>tzon</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 7:21), indicating that two sheep are characterized as <i>tzon</i>; and the mitzva of the first sheared wool is written using the term “your flock [<i>tzonekha</i>].” <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> It is at least <b>five</b> sheep, <b>as it is stated: “And five sheep [<i>tzon</i>] made”</b> (I Samuel 25:18).
<b>Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas says:</b> When shearing <b>five sheep,</b> the <b>sheared</b> wool of each sheep weighing <b>one hundred dinars</b> each <b>and half [<i>peras</i>]</b> of one hundred dinars each, i.e., one hundred and fifty dinars each, <b>are</b> subject to the <b>obligation of the first sheared wool,</b> i.e., they render the owner obligated to give the first sheared wool to the priests. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> Any <b>five sheep,</b> each of whose <b>sheared</b> wool weighs <b>any amount,</b> render the owner obligated in the mitzva.
<b>And how much</b> of the sheared wool <b>does one give to</b> the priest? One gives him sheared wool of the <b>weight</b> of <b>five <i>sela</i> in Judea, which are</b> the equivalent of <b>ten <i>sela</i> in the Galilee,</b> as the weight of the Galilean <i>sela</i> is half that of the Judean <i>sela</i>. Furthermore, although one may give the wool to the priest without laundering it, this must be the weight of the wool once <b>laundered and not</b> when <b>sullied,</b> as is characteristic of wool when sheared. The measure that must be given to the priest is <b>enough to fashion a small garment from it, as it is stated: “Shall you give him”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:4), indicating <b>that</b> the sheared wool <b>must contain enough for</b> a proper <b>gift.</b>
If the owner of the shearing <b>did not manage to give it to</b> the priest <b>until he dyed it,</b> the owner is <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva of the first sheared wool, as this constitutes a change in the wool by which means he acquires ownership of it. If he <b>laundered it but did not dye it,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to give the first sheared wool, as laundering does not constitute a change in the wool.
<b>One who purchases the fleece of the sheep of a gentile</b> is <b>exempt from</b> the obligation of giving <b>the first sheared wool</b> to the priest. With regard to <b>one who purchases the fleece of the sheep of another</b> Jew, <b>if</b> the seller <b>kept</b> some of the wool, then <b>the seller is obligated</b> to give the first sheared wool to the priest. If the seller <b>did not keep</b> any of the wool, <b>the buyer is obligated</b> to give it. If the seller <b>had two types</b> of sheep, <b>gray and white,</b> and he <b>sold</b> the buyer the <b>gray</b> fleece <b>but not</b> the <b>white</b> fleece, or if he sold the fleece of the <b>male</b> sheep <b>but not</b> of the <b>female</b> sheep, then <b>this</b> one, the seller, <b>gives</b> the first sheared wool <b>for himself</b> to the priest from the wool that he kept, <b>and that</b> one, the buyer, <b>gives</b> the first sheared wool <b>for himself</b> to the priest from the wool that he bought.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that the mitzva of the first sheared wool does not apply <b>to sacrificial</b> animals. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that it does <b>not</b> apply? The Gemara answers that the <b>verse states: “Your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:4), indicating that the mitzva applies to non-sacred animals, which belong to a private individual, <b>and not</b> to <b>a flock</b> that is <b>consecrated</b> property.
The Gemara challenges: <b>The reason</b> for the exemption of sacrificial animals <b>is that the Merciful One writes “your flock,”</b> from which it may be inferred that <b>were that not</b> the case <b>I would say</b> that even with regard to <b>sacrificial</b> animals one is <b>obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool. But</b> this suggestion is impossible, since <b>they are not fit for shearing, as it is written</b> with regard to firstborn animals, which are consecrated: <b>“And you shall not shear the firstborn of your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19).
The Gemara explains: <b>If</b> the mishna was referring to sheep <b>consecrated</b> for the <b>altar, indeed</b> there would be no need to derive their exemption from the verse. But <b>here we are dealing with</b> sheep <b>consecrated</b> to the treasury for <b>Temple maintenance,</b> which it is permitted to shear, and the verse teaches that even with regard to these one is exempt from the mitzva of the first sheared wool.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say</b> with regard to animals <b>consecrated</b> for <b>Temple maintenance</b> that it is <b>prohibited to shear</b> them <b>or</b> to <b>work</b> them? The Gemara answers: The prohibition with regard to animals consecrated for Temple maintenance applies <b>by rabbinic</b> law, not by Torah law. Therefore, it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since by Torah</b> law <b>they</b> are <b>fit for shearing,</b> in a case <b>where</b> one transgressed the rabbinical prohibition and <b>sheared</b> the consecrated sheep, he <b>should give</b> the first sheared wool <b>to</b> the priest. Consequently, the verse teaches that he is exempt from the mitzva of the first sheared wool.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> since he <b>consecrated</b> the wool it is consecrated property, and therefore in practice it cannot be given to a priest. Consequently, there is no need to derive their exemption from the verse. The Gemara explains: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the owner is required <b>to redeem</b> the wool by giving its value to the Temple treasury <b>and</b> then <b>give</b> it <b>to</b> the priest.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> when an animal is redeemed it <b>requires standing and valuation,</b> as it is written: “And he shall stand the animal before the priest, and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest evaluates it, so shall it be” (Leviticus 27:11–12). Once the wool has been sheared this process cannot be performed, which means that the wool cannot be redeemed. The Gemara comments: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that animals <b>consecrated</b> for <b>Temple maintenance were not included in</b> the requirement <b>of standing and valuation. But according to the one who said</b> that they <b>were</b> included in this requirement, <b>what can be said?</b>
<b>Rabbi Mani bar Pattish said in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> The statement <b>here</b> in the mishna is referring <b>to</b> a case where one <b>consecrated</b> the rest of <b>his animal for Temple maintenance except for its fleece,</b> which he reserved for himself. Because the owner did not consecrate the wool, it might <b>enter your mind to say: Let him shear</b> the sheep <b>and</b> be obligated to <b>give</b> the wool to the priest. Therefore, the <b>verse states: “Your flock,”</b> indicating that the mitzva applies to non-sacred animals, which belong to an individual, <b>and not</b> to <b>sheep that are consecrated</b> property.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If so,</b> that the mishna is discussing a case where one consecrated an animal except for its fleece, one could say that it is <b>also</b> referring to animals <b>consecrated</b> for the <b>altar.</b> The Gemara answers: The mishna cannot be discussing animals consecrated for the altar, as it is prohibited to shear them even if their fleece was not consecrated. The reason is that this causes the animal to <b>become weakened,</b> which entails a loss of consecrated property.
The Gemara objects: But animals <b>consecrated</b> for <b>Temple maintenance</b> are <b>also weakened</b> by shearing, and therefore it should be prohibited to shear them as well. The Gemara explains: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>said</b> that he consecrates his animal for Temple maintenance <b>except for</b> both its <b>fleece and</b> its <b>weakening,</b> i.e., the loss of strength caused by shearing.
The Gemara further objects: The mishna could <b>also</b> be referring to animals <b>consecrated</b> for the <b>altar</b> in a case <b>where</b> one <b>said</b> that he consecrates the animal <b>except for</b> both its <b>fleece and</b> the <b>weakening,</b> i.e., the loss in strength caused by shearing. The Gemara explains: With regard to animals consecrated for the altar this stipulation is ineffective, as <b>even so,</b> i.e., despite his declaration, the <b>sanctity extends to the entire</b> animal, and therefore it is prohibited to shear it.
The Gemara explains: <b>And from where do you say</b> that if one consecrates an animal for the altar the sanctity extends to the entire animal? This is <b>as Rabbi Yosei said: Isn’t it</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> animals that if <b>one says: The leg of this</b> animal is consecrated as <b>a burnt offering,</b> then the <b>entire</b> animal is <b>a burnt offering,</b> as the sanctity of the leg spreads throughout the animal’s body? <b>And even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> that <b>it is not entirely a burnt offering, that statement</b> of Rabbi Meir applies only <b>where he consecrated</b> its leg, which is <b>not a matter,</b> i.e., a limb, <b>upon which</b> the animal’s <b>life depends.</b> It is possible for an animal to survive the removal of a leg. <b>But</b> if <b>one consecrated a matter upon which</b> the animal’s <b>life depends,</b> everyone agrees that all of it <b>is consecrated.</b>
§ <b>Rava said</b> that there is no need to interpret the mishna as discussing a case where one consecrated a whole animal apart from its fleece and the loss caused by shearing. Rather, the mishna is referring <b>to</b> one who <b>consecrates the fleece itself</b> to the treasury for Temple maintenance, but not the sheep. It might <b>enter your mind to say: Let him shear</b> the sheep <b>and redeem</b> the wool by giving its value to the Temple treasury, <b>and</b> then be required to <b>give</b> the wool <b>to</b> the priest.
Therefore, the <b>verse states:</b> “The first sheared wool <b>of your flock, shall you give him”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:4), which indicates that there should be no additional action between shearing and giving the first sheared wool to the priest. In other words, the mitzva of first sheared wool applies to a sheep <b>that is lacking only shearing and giving,</b> which <b>excludes this</b> sheep <b>that is lacking shearing, redeeming, and giving.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if this verse is the source of the exemption of consecrated animals, then <b>for what</b> purpose does the term <b>“your flock” come?</b> That term also indicates that certain sheep are excluded from the mitzva. The Gemara answers that it is necessary <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An animal</b> owned by two <b>partners is obligated,</b> i.e., renders its owners obligated, <b>in the</b> mitzva of the <b>first sheared</b> wool, <b>but Rabbi Ilai exempts</b> them. <b>What is the reason for</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Ilai?</b> The reason is that the <b>verse states “your flock,”</b> using the singular pronoun, indicating that the mitzva applies to animals belonging to an individual, <b>but not</b> to sheep that are owned <b>in partnership.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that joint owners of sheep are obligated in the mitzva of the first sheared wool, what is excluded by the term “your flock”? The Gemara answers that this serves <b>to exclude</b> an animal owned in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a gentile.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And from where does Rabbi Ilai</b> derive that an animal owned in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a gentile</b> renders its Jewish owner exempt from the mitzva?
The Gemara answers: He <b>derives it from the beginning of</b> this <b>verse,</b> which states with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>“The first fruits of your grain,</b> of your wine, and of your oil” (Deuteronomy 18:4), using the singular pronoun. This indicates that only in the case of produce owned by a Jew is one obligated to separate <i>teruma</i>, <b>but not</b> with regard to that which is owned <b>in partnership</b> with <b>a gentile.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why do the <b>Rabbis,</b> who derive the exemption of sheep owned in partnership with a gentile from the term “your flock,” not derive this from the term “your grain”? The Gemara answers that the repetition of the term “the first” with regard to the first sheared wool: “The first fruits of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and <b>the first sheared wool</b> of your flock, shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), is an indication that the verse <b>concluded</b> discussion of <b>the</b> previous <b>matter.</b> The superfluous mention of “first” signals that the two issues discussed in this verse, which are the first fruits, i.e., <i>teruma</i>, and the first sheared wool, are two separate matters. Therefore, one cannot derive the <i>halakhot</i> of one from the other.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Ilai</b> respond to the Rabbis’ claim? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ilai holds that when the verse states: “And the first sheared wool,” the conjunction <b>“and” goes back and combines</b> the two matters together.

Daf 135b

The Gemara asks further: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to Rabbi Ilai’s claim? The Gemara answers: The Rabbis do not accept that the conjunction “and” goes back and combines the two matters together, as, if that were so, <b>let the Merciful One write neither “and” nor “the first.”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Ilai</b> respond to this contention? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Ilai would say that the first sheared wool and <i>teruma</i> are essentially different obligations, as the first sheared wool is merely a monetary obligation with no inherent sanctity. By contrast, it is prohibited for non-priests to partake of <i>teruma</i>. <b>Since this</b> case of the first sheared wool involves only <b>sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value, and that</b> case of <i>teruma</i> referred to in the beginning of the verse involves <b>inherent sanctity,</b> the verse <b>separated them</b> through the repetition of the term “the first,” <b>and</b> then the verse <b>went back and combined them</b> through the term “and,” so that their <i>halakhot</i> could be derived from one another.
The Gemara provides an alternative explanation as to why the Rabbis do not derive the exemption of sheep owned in partnership with a gentile from the case of <i>teruma</i>. <b>If you wish, say</b> instead that <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i>, the Rabbis</b> hold that one who owns produce in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a gentile</b> is in fact <b>obligated, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there were <b>a Jew and a gentile who purchased a field in partnership,</b> the produce grown in that field is considered to be <b>untithed produce,</b> which is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>terumot</i> and tithes, <b>and non-sacred</b> produce, which is exempt from the requirements of <i>terumot</i> and tithes, <b>mixed together;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The portion <b>of the Jew is obligated</b> in <i>teruma</i> and tithes, <b>but</b> the portion <b>of the gentile is exempt.</b>
The Gemara explains the inference. <b>They disagree only with regard to</b> the following issue: <b>That</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds</b> that <b>there is</b> retroactive <b>clarification,</b> which means that when they divide the produce it will be clarified who owned which produce from the outset; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that <b>there is no</b> retroactive <b>clarification,</b> and because it grew in a mixed state, it retains that status even after they divide the produce. <b>But</b> with regard to produce that a Jew owns in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a gentile, everyone agrees</b> that it is <b>obligated</b> in <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara presents an alternative explanation of Rabbi Ilai’s opinion: <b>If you wish, say</b> instead that Rabbi Ilai does not derive only the exemption of sheep owned in partnership with a Jew from the term “your flock” while he derives the exemption of sheep owned in partnership with a gentile from the term “your grain.” Rather, <b>according to Rabbi Ilai both</b> exemptions are <b>derived from</b> the term <b>“your flock.”</b>
The Gemara explains why both exemptions can be derived from a single phrase: With regard to <b>partnership</b> with <b>a gentile, what is the reason</b> that one is exempted from the obligation of the first sheared wool? It is due to the fact <b>that</b> the sheep is <b>not exclusively his.</b> In the case of a partnership <b>with a Jew too,</b> the sheep is <b>not exclusively his.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> reply to this claim of Rabbi Ilai? The Gemara answers: The Rabbis hold that partnership with a Jew cannot be compared to partnership with a gentile, as <b>a gentile is not obligated</b> in the mitzva of the first sheared wool, whereas <b>a Jew is obligated.</b>
§ <b>Rava said</b> with regard to the dispute between the Rabbis and Rabbi Ilai: Although <b>Rabbi Ilai</b> holds that two partners who own a sheep are exempt from the first sheared wool, he <b>concedes</b> that jointly owned produce is obligated <b>in <i>teruma</i>.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though it is written</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>“Your grain”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:4), using the singular pronoun, from which one may infer that with regard to <b>yours, yes,</b> one is obligated, whereas with regard to that <b>which is</b> owned <b>in partnership,</b> the partners are <b>not</b> obligated.
The Gemara explains that the joint owners of produce are nevertheless obligated in <i>teruma</i>, as <b>the Merciful One writes:</b> “There will I require <b>your <i>terumot</i>”</b> (Ezekiel 20:40). The use of the plural pronoun in this verse indicates that even partners who own produce are obligated in <i>teruma</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the term: <b>“Your grain,”</b> using the singular pronoun? The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to exclude</b> produce owned in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a gentile.</b>
Similarly, with regard to <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> the portion of dough that one is required to separate and give to a priest, Rabbi Ilai concedes that joint owners are obligated in this mitzva, <b>even though</b> one could claim otherwise, <b>as it is written:</b> “Of <b>the first</b> of your dough you shall set apart a cake for a gift” (Numbers 15:20), <b>and it is possible to say</b> that one <b>should derive</b> a verbal analogy between the term <b>“the first”</b> in this context and the term <b>“the first” from the first sheared wool: Just as there,</b> with regard to the first sheared wool, if the sheep are owned <b>in partnership</b> the owners are <b>not</b> obligated, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to <i>ḥalla</i>, if the dough is owned <b>in partnership</b> they are <b>not</b> obligated. Nevertheless, <b>the Merciful One writes: “Your dough,”</b> using a plural pronoun, indicating that even joint owners of dough are obligated to separate <i>ḥalla</i>.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> according to this claim, <b>the reason</b> joint owners of dough are obligated to separate <i>ḥalla</i> is <b>that it is written “your dough,”</b> using a plural pronoun. It can be inferred from here that <b>were that not</b> the case <b>I would say</b> that they are exempt, as <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the term <b>“the first”</b> mentioned with regard to <i>ḥalla</i> and the term <b>“the first” from the first sheared wool. On the contrary,</b> one <b>should derive</b> a verbal analogy between the term “the first” with regard to <i>ḥalla</i> and the term “the first” <b>from <i>teruma</i>:</b> Just as the obligation to separate <i>teruma</i> applies to produce owned in partnership, so too, the obligation to separate <i>ḥalla</i> applies to dough owned in partnership. It is preferable to compare <i>ḥalla</i> to <i>teruma</i>, because their halakhic status is similar in that they are both prohibited to non-priests. If so, the inference from the term “your dough” is unnecessary.
The Gemara explains: It <b>is indeed so;</b> the obligation of produce owned in partnership in the case of <i>ḥalla</i> is derived from the case of <i>teruma</i>. <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the term <b>“your dough”?</b> This teaches that the quantity of dough to which the obligation of <i>ḥalla</i> applies <b>is equivalent to</b> the quantity of <b>your dough,</b> i.e., the quantity of dough kneaded daily by the Jewish people when they were in the Sinai Desert, when the mitzva was given. This is one <i>omer</i> for each person (see Exodus 16:16), which is a tenth of an ephah (see Exodus 16:36).
Likewise, with regard to <b><i>pe’a</i>,</b> produce in the corner of the field that is left for the poor, Rabbi Ilai concedes that the joint owners of produce are obligated, <b>even though it is written</b> in the verse cited below: <b>“Your field [<i>sadekha</i>],”</b> using a singular pronoun, from which it can be inferred that with regard to <b>your</b> field, <b>yes,</b> one is obligated, whereas with regard to that <b>which is</b> owned <b>in partnership,</b> one is <b>not</b> obligated. The reason is that <b>the Merciful One writes: “And when you reap [<i>uvekutzrekhem</i>] the harvest of your land,</b> you shall not entirely reap the corner of your field” (Leviticus 19:9). The term “when you reap” uses the plural pronoun, which indicates that even partners of land are obligated in <i>pe’a</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the term <b>“your field”</b> in the singular? The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to exclude</b> land owned in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a gentile</b> from the obligation of <i>pe’a</i>.
Similarly, with regard to the <b>firstborn</b> status of a male firstborn kosher animal, Rabbi Ilai concedes that jointly owned animals are sanctified, <b>even though it is written: “All the firstborn that are born of your herd [<i>bivkarekha</i>] and of your flock [<i>tzonekha</i>]</b> that are male you shall sanctify to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 15:19). Once again it might have been inferred from the singular pronoun in the terms “your herd” and “your flock” that <b>your</b> firstborn, <b>yes,</b> are sanctified, but the firstborn <b>that is</b> owned <b>in partnership</b> is <b>not</b> sanctified.
Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes:</b> “And there you shall bring there your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, and your tithes, and the gift of your hand, and your vows, and your gift offerings, <b>and the firstborn of your herd [<i>bekarkhem</i>] and of your flock [<i>tzonekhem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:6). The pronouns in the terms “your herd” and “your flock” in this verse are in the plural, which indicates that firstborn animals owned in partnership are sanctified. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the terms <b>“your herd” and “your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19), where the pronouns are in the singular? The Gemara again answers: This serves <b>to exclude</b> animals owned in <b>partnership</b> with <b>a gentile,</b> which are not sanctified.
Likewise, with regard to <b>a <i>mezuza</i>,</b> Rabbi Ilai concedes that the house of two partners is obligated, <b>even though it is written:</b> “And you shall write them upon the doorposts of <b>your house [<i>beitekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:9), with a singular pronoun, from which one might have inferred that with regard to <b>your</b> house, <b>yes,</b> it is obligated, whereas a house owned by two people <b>in partnership</b> is <b>not</b> obligated. Consequently, <b>the Merciful One writes</b> with regard to the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>: <b>“So that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21). The use of the plural pronoun in the terms “your days” and “your children” in this verse indicates that partners are obligated in the mitzva of <i>mezuza</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>for what</b> purpose does the term <b>“your house [<i>beitekha</i>]” come?</b> The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>for that which Rabba</b> derived, <b>as Rabba said:</b>

Daf 136a

The term “your house [<i>beitekha</i>]” is similar to the term: You enter [<i>bi’atkha</i>], indicating that one places the <i>mezuza</i> in the <b>way</b> that <b>you enter</b> the house. When a person lifts his foot to begin walking, he lifts his right foot first. Therefore, the <i>mezuza</i> is affixed <b>to the right</b> side of the doorway, as one enters.
Similarly, with regard to <b>tithe,</b> Rabbi Ilai concedes that joint owners of produce are obligated, <b>even though it is written: “The tithe of your grain [<i>deganekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), using the singular pronoun, from which one might have inferred that with regard to <b>your</b> grain, <b>yes,</b> one is obligated, whereas with regard to that <b>which is</b> owned <b>in partnership,</b> one is <b>not</b> obligated. The reason is that <b>the Merciful One writes:</b> “All <b>your tithes [<i>ma’asroteikhem</i>]”</b> (Numbers 18:28), using the plural pronoun, indicating that even partners are obligated in this mitzva. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>for what</b> purpose does the term: <b>“The tithe of your grain [<i>deganekha</i>],”</b> using the singular pronoun, <b>come?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to exclude</b> produce owned in <b>partnership with a gentile</b> from the obligation of tithes.
Likewise, with regard to the <b>gifts</b> to which members of the priesthood are entitled, i.e., the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw, Rabbi Ilai concedes that the joint owners of an animal are obligated, <b>even though the Merciful One writes:</b> “And this shall be the priests’ due from the people, from those who slaughter an animal, whether it be ox or sheep; <b>and he shall give</b> to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3).
The Gemara elaborates: <b>It is possible to say</b> that one should <b>derive</b> a verbal analogy between <b>giving</b> mentioned in the context of gifts to the priesthood and <b>giving from the first sheared wool.</b> The Torah states: “He shall give,” with regard to the gifts of the priesthood, and it states: “Shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), with regard to the first sheared wool; <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the first sheared wool, sheep owned <b>in partnership</b> do <b>not</b> render their owners obligated, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the gifts of the priesthood, an animal owned <b>in partnership</b> does <b>not</b> render the owners obligated. But <b>the Merciful One writes: “From those who slaughter an animal,”</b> in the plural, indicating that even the owners of an animal owned in partnership are obligated to give the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> according to this inference, <b>the reason</b> the joint owners of an animal are obligated in the gifts of the priesthood is <b>that the Merciful One writes: “From those who slaughter an animal,”</b> in the plural. <b>But</b> were it <b>not so, I would say</b> that they are exempt, as <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from the first sheared wool. On the contrary,</b> since the term “shall you give him” is also referring to <i>teruma</i>, one should <b>derive</b> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from <i>teruma</i>:</b> Just as the obligation of <i>teruma</i> applies to those who own produce in partnership, so too, the requirement of the gifts of the priesthood applies to partners that own an animal together.
The Gemara explains: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so;</b> the obligation of partners with regard to gifts of the priesthood is derived from <i>teruma</i>. But if so, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“from those who slaughter an animal”?</b> It is necessary <b>for that which Rava</b> taught, <b>as Rava said:</b> The priest issues his <b>demand</b> to receive the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw <b>from the butcher</b> who slaughtered the animal, not from the buyer.
Similarly, with regard to the <b>first fruits,</b> Rabbi Ilai concedes that the joint owners of produce are obligated, <b>even though it is written:</b> “And you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you shall bring in from <b>your land [<i>be’artzekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:2), using the singular pronoun. One might have inferred from the singular pronoun that with regard to <b>your</b> land, <b>yes,</b> one is obligated, whereas with regard to <b>that which is</b> owned <b>in partnership</b> one is <b>not</b> obligated.
Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “The first fruits of all that is in their land,</b> which they bring to the Lord, shall be yours” (Numbers 18:13). The use of the plural pronoun indicates that even from land owned in partnership one is obligated to bring first fruits. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the term <b>“your land [<i>be’artzekha</i>],”</b> using the singular pronoun? The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to exclude</b> produce grown <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael from the mitzva of the first fruits.
Likewise, with regard to the mitzva to attach <b>ritual fringes</b> to one’s garment, Rabbi Ilai concedes that a jointly owned garment is obligated, <b>even though the Merciful One writes:</b> “You shall make yourself twisted cords upon the four corners of <b>your covering [<i>kesutekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:12), using the singular pronoun. It might have been inferred from the singular form that with regard to <b>your</b> covering, <b>yes,</b> it is obligated, whereas with regard to <b>that which is</b> owned <b>in partnership</b> it is <b>not</b> obligated.
Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes:</b> “And they shall make for themselves fringes <b>in the corners of their garments, throughout their generations,</b> and they shall put with the fringe of each corner a thread of blue” (Numbers 15:38). The use of the plural pronoun indicates that even jointly owned garments are obligated. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the term <b>“your covering [<i>kesutekha</i>],”</b> using the singular pronoun? The Gemara answers: This is necessary <b>for that which Rav Yehuda</b> taught, <b>as Rav Yehuda said: A borrowed cloak is exempt from the</b> mitzva of <b>ritual fringes throughout</b> the first <b>thirty days.</b>
Similarly, with regard to the obligation of establishing <b>a parapet</b> around a roof, Rabbi Ilai concedes that the joint owners of a roof are obligated, <b>even though the Merciful One writes:</b> “When you build a new house, then you shall make a parapet <b>for your roof [<i>legaggekha</i>],”</b> using the singular pronoun, “and you shall not bring blood upon your house, if any man falls from there” (Deuteronomy 22:8). One might have inferred from the singular form that with regard to <b>your</b> roof, <b>yes,</b> one is obligated, whereas with regard to <b>that which is</b> owned <b>in partnership</b> one is <b>not</b> obligated.
Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes: “If any man falls from there,”</b> indicating that wherever the danger of falling from the roof exists, there is an obligation to erect a parapet. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>for what</b> purpose does the term <b>“your roof [<i>gaggekha</i>],”</b> using the singular pronoun, <b>come?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to exclude synagogues and houses of study.</b>
§ Rava maintains that although Rabbi Ilai holds that if a sheep is owned in partnership its owners are exempt from giving the first sheared wool to a priest, he concedes that partners are obligated with regard to all the other issues discussed above, including the mitzva of the firstborn animal and the gifts of the priesthood. <b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said: These principles</b> stated by Rava <b>are not</b> accepted, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An animal</b> owned by <b>partners is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>a firstborn,</b> i.e., its offspring is subject to firstborn status. <b>And Rabbi Ilai exempts</b> the animal from having its offspring subject to firstborn status.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ilai? As it is written:</b> “And the firstborn of <b>your herd and of your flock [<i>bekarekha vetzonekha</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:17), using the singular pronoun, indicating that only privately owned animals are consecrated. The Gemara comments: <b>But it is</b> also <b>written:</b> “And the firstborn of <b>your herd and of your flock [<i>bekarkhem vetzonekhem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 12:6), using the plural pronoun. The Gemara explains: This verse is referring to the obligation <b>of all Jews</b> to bring their firstborn animals to the Temple, but this applies only to animals with a single owner.
<b>Rav Ḥanina of Sura</b> also <b>said: These principles</b> stated by Rava <b>are not</b> accepted, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An animal</b> owned by <b>partners is obligated,</b> i.e., renders its owners obligated, <b>to</b> take <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood from it, <b>and Rabbi Ilai exempts</b> the partners from the obligation. <b>What is the reason</b> for Rabbi Ilai’s statement? He <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy between <b>giving</b> mentioned in this context <b>and giving from the first sheared wool.</b> The Torah states: “He shall give” (Deuteronomy 18:3), with regard to the gifts of the priesthood, and: “Shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), with regard to the first sheared wool. <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the first sheared wool, in the case of sheep owned <b>in partnership</b> the owners are <b>not</b> obligated according to Rabbi Ilai, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the gifts of the priesthood, if the animal is owned <b>in partnership</b> the owners are <b>not</b> obligated.
Rabbi Ḥanina of Sura adds: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to accept Rava’s statement that in the case <b>of <i>teruma</i></b> Rabbi Ilai <b>deems</b> partners <b>obligated,</b> this is not possible. The reason is that the term “shall you give him” is also used with regard to <i>teruma</i>. Accordingly, instead of deriving the <i>halakha</i> of an animal owned by partners with regard to gifts of the priesthood by verbal analogy from the first sheared wool, one should <b>derive</b> by verbal analogy between <b>giving</b> mentioned with regard to gifts of the priesthood and <b>giving from <i>teruma</i>,</b> as follows: Just as joint owners of produce are obligated to separate <i>teruma</i> from that produce, so too with regard to an animal owned in partnership, the owners are obligated to take the gifts of the priesthood from it. <b>Rather, conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>with regard to <i>teruma</i> too,</b> Rabbi Ilai <b>deems</b> partners <b>exempt,</b> and therefore their exemption from the gifts of the priesthood can be derived either from the first sheared wool or from <i>teruma</i>.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If</b> it is possible to derive <i>halakhot</i> of the gifts of the priesthood from <i>teruma</i> by verbal analogy, one could also say: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i></b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>yes,</b> it applies, whereas <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael it does <b>not</b> apply, <b>so too,</b> with regard to the <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood, <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>yes,</b> they apply, whereas <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael they do <b>not</b> apply. <b>Rabbi Yosei of Neharbil said: Yes,</b> it is indeed so, <b>and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ilai says:</b> The <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood <b>apply only in Eretz</b> Yisrael. <b>And likewise, Rabbi Ilai would say:</b> The mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool applies only in Eretz</b> Yisrael.
<b>What is the reason for</b> the ruling of <b>Rabbi Ilai? Rava said:</b> He <b>derives</b> by means of a verbal analogy between <b>giving</b> mentioned in the context of the first sheared wool and <b>giving from <i>teruma</i></b> that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i></b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>yes,</b> it applies, whereas <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, it does <b>not</b> apply; <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>the first sheared wool, in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>yes,</b> it applies, whereas <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael it does <b>not</b> apply.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>If</b> one compares the first sheared wool to <i>teruma</i> by means of a verbal analogy, one can say that <b>just as</b> with regard to the requirement to separate <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> it <b>produces</b> the halakhic status of forbidden <b>untithed produce, so too</b> the requirement to separate <b>the first sheared wool produces</b> the halakhic status of <b>untithed produce,</b> i.e., wool from which the first sheared wool has not been separated should be forbidden. Yet this is not the <i>halakha</i>. Rava <b>said to him</b> that the <b>verse states: “And the first sheared wool of your flock, shall you give him,”</b> i.e., the priest, which indicates that <b>you,</b> i.e., the priest, have a right <b>to</b> the first sheared wool <b>only from its</b> designation as <b>the first sheared wool and onward.</b> Since the first sheared wool does not belong to the priest prior to its designation, it does not render the rest of the wool forbidden.
Abaye continues to question Rava: <b>If</b> one compares the first sheared wool to <i>teruma</i> by means of a verbal analogy, one can say that <b>just as</b> non-priests who partake of <b><i>teruma</i></b> intentionally are <b>liable</b> to receive the punishment of <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>and</b> those who do so unwittingly are obligated to pay an additional <b>one-fifth</b> of its value, <b>so too,</b> non-priests who derive benefit from <b>the first sheared wool</b> intentionally should be <b>liable</b> to <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>and</b> those who do so unwittingly should be obligated to pay an additional <b>one-fifth</b> of its value.
Rava replies: The <b>verse states</b> with regard to a non-priest who partakes of <i>teruma</i>: “Lest they bear sin for it, <b>and die because of it,</b> if they profane it…and if a man eat of the holy thing through error, <b>and he shall add</b> its fifth part <b>to it,</b> and shall give to the priest the holy thing” (Leviticus 22:9–14). Rava infers: “He shall add its fifth part <b>to it,” and not to the first sheared wool. “And die because of it,” and not because of the first sheared wool.</b> Consequently, a non-priest is liable to death at the hand of Heaven or to pay an additional one-fifth for partaking of <i>teruma</i>, but not for deriving benefit from the first sheared wool.
Abaye further questions Rava: <b>If</b> one compares the first sheared wool to <i>teruma</i> by verbal analogy, one can say that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> the <b>first and second</b> tithes are separated from the produce <b>after</b> <i>teruma</i> is separated, <b>so too</b> with regard to the <b>first sheared wool, first and second</b> tithes should be separated from the fleece <b>after it.</b> Rava replies: The <b>verse states</b> that the first sheared wool is <b>“the first.”</b> Since the verse already stated “first” with regard to <i>teruma</i>, its repetition indicates that in this case there is no second separation. One <b>does not have</b> any separation <b>in this</b> case <b>other than the first</b> one.
Abaye continues to question Rava: <b>If</b> one compares the first sheared wool to <i>teruma</i> by means of a verbal analogy, one can say that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i></b> one may <b>not</b> separate <b>from</b> the <b>new</b> produce of this year <b>on</b> behalf of <b>the old</b> produce from last year, <b>so too,</b> one may <b>not</b> separate <b>the first sheared wool from</b> the <b>new</b> shearing of this year <b>on</b> behalf of <b>the old</b> shearing from last year. On this occasion Rava replied: <b>Yes,</b> that is the <i>halakha</i>.
Rava proves his point: <b>And it is</b> likewise <b>taught</b> that this is Rabbi Ilai’s opinion, through a contradiction between two <i>baraitot</i>. One <i>baraita</i> teaches: A person <b>had two sheep;</b> he <b>sheared</b> them <b>and left</b> the shearing in his possession, and the following year he again <b>sheared</b> them <b>and left</b> the shearing in his possession, and continued in this manner for <b>two or three years.</b> Although the accumulated wool is equivalent to the wool of five sheep, to which the obligation of the first sheared wool applies, the wool <b>does not accumulate</b> to constitute the minimum amount, as only two sheep were shorn. This indicates that if the wool is from <b>five</b> sheep, then it <b>accumulates,</b> and one is obligated to give the priest the first sheared wool, despite the fact that the wool was shorn in different years.
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that even wool from five sheep shorn in different years <b>does not accumulate</b> to create an obligation? <b>Rather, conclude from</b> this contradiction that <b>this</b> second <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ilai,</b> who compares the first sheared wool to <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, he holds that wool from separate years does not accumulate. <b>And that</b> first <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who do not compare the first sheared wool to <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, they maintain that wool from separate years does accumulate.
Abaye asks Rava: <b>If</b> one compares the first sheared wool to <i>teruma</i>, one can say that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> if a Jew purchased a field from a gentile then produce that <b>grew under</b> the ownership of a Jew, who is <b>obligated</b> to separate <i>teruma</i> from his produce, is <b>obligated,</b> whereas produce that <b>grew under</b> the ownership of a gentile, whose produce is <b>exempt,</b> is <b>exempt</b> even after purchase by a Jew; <b>so too,</b> with regard to the <b>first sheared wool,</b> the fleece that <b>grew under</b> the ownership of a Jew, who is <b>obligated</b> in the first sheared wool, is <b>obligated,</b> whereas the fleece that grew <b>under</b> the ownership of a gentile, who is <b>exempt,</b> is <b>exempt</b> even after purchase by a Jew.
Abaye adds: <b>And with regard to <i>teruma</i>, from where do we</b> derive that produce that grew when owned by a gentile is exempt? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a Jew who purchased a field in Syria from a gentile,</b> if he bought the field <b>before</b> the produce <b>reached one-third</b> of its growth, he is <b>obligated</b> to separate <i>teruma</i>. If he bought the field <b>after</b> the produce <b>reached one-third</b> of its growth, <b>Rabbi Akiva deems him obligated</b> to separate <i>teruma</i> <b>from the</b> growth <b>added</b> after he bought the field, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt.</b> All agree, though, that he is exempt with regard to the part of the produce that grew under the gentile’s ownership.
<b>And if you would say: Indeed,</b> Rabbi Ilai holds that wool that grew under the ownership of a gentile is exempt from the mitzva of the first sheared wool, that is difficult, as <b>didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (135a): <b>One who purchases the fleece of</b> the <b>sheep of a gentile</b> is <b>exempt from</b> the obligation of the <b>first sheared wool?</b> It can be inferred from the mishna that if one purchased the gentile’s <b>sheep</b> when they were ready <b>for shearing,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> in the mitzva of the first sheared wool. Rava replied: <b>The mishna</b>

Daf 136b

<b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ilai,</b> who holds that if the wool grew under the ownership of a gentile one is exempt from separating the first sheared wool.
Abaye further asks Rava: <b>If</b> one compares the first sheared wool to <i>teruma</i>, can one say that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i></b> one may <b>not</b> separate <i>teruma</i> <b>from</b> one <b>type</b> of produce <b>on</b> behalf of that <b>which is not</b> of the same <b>type, so too,</b> one may <b>not</b> separate <b>the first sheared wool from</b> one <b>type</b> of sheep <b>on</b> behalf of sheep <b>which are not</b> of the same <b>type?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to <i>teruma</i>, from where do we</b> derive that one may not do so? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one had two types of figs, black</b> figs <b>and white</b> figs; <b>or similarly,</b> if one had <b>two types of wheat,</b> one may <b>not separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes from this</b> type <b>on</b> behalf of <b>that</b> type. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says in the name of Rabbi Ilai: Beit Shammai say</b> that one may <b>not separate <i>teruma</i></b> from one of these on behalf of the other, <b>and Beit Hillel say</b> that one may <b>separate <i>teruma</i></b> from one on behalf of the other, as they consider all forms of figs or wheat to be a single type. But all agree that with regard to two distinct types of food one may not separate <i>teruma</i> from one type on behalf of another type. <b>So too,</b> with regard to <b>the first sheared wool,</b> perhaps one may <b>not</b> separate <b>from</b> one <b>type</b> of sheep <b>on</b> behalf of sheep <b>which are not</b> of the same <b>type.</b>
Rava replied: <b>Yes,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i>. <b>And we learned</b> in the mishna (135a) that one may not separate the first sheared wool from one type of sheep on behalf of another: If the seller <b>had two types</b> of sheep, <b>gray and white,</b> and he <b>sold him</b> the <b>gray</b> fleece <b>but not</b> the <b>white</b> fleece, then <b>this</b> seller <b>gives</b> the first sheared wool <b>for himself</b> from the wool that he kept, <b>and that</b> buyer <b>gives</b> the first sheared wool <b>for himself</b> from the wool that he bought.
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so,</b> then consider <b>the latter clause, which teaches:</b> If he sold the fleece of the <b>male</b> sheep <b>but not</b> of the <b>female</b> sheep, then <b>this</b> seller <b>gives</b> the first sheared wool <b>for himself</b> from the wool that he kept, <b>and that</b> buyer <b>gives</b> the first sheared wool <b>for himself</b> from the wool that he bought. Is this <b>also due to</b> the fact that <b>they are two</b> different <b>types?</b> Clearly, it is not.
The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> the mishna <b>teaches us good advice.</b> The seller is obligated to give the first sheared wool even on behalf of the wool he sold. Since the fleece of the female sheep is softer and more valuable, it is profitable for the seller to buy back part of the fleece of the male sheep and separate it as the first sheared wool on behalf of the sheep he sold, so <b>that he gives</b> the priest both <b>from this</b> wool <b>that is soft and from that</b> wool <b>that is hard,</b> rather than giving him from the fleece of his female sheep on behalf of the male sheep. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to the gray and white sheep, the mishna <b>teaches us good advice,</b> that it is profitable for the seller to buy back part of the fleece of the gray sheep, so <b>that he gives</b> the priests <b>from both</b> types of wool, rather than giving the first sheared wool entirely from the more valuable white fleece.
According to the above explanation, the mishna rules that it is permitted to separate the first sheared wool from one type of sheep on behalf of another type. This is difficult according to the opinion of Rabbi Ilai, who compares the first sheared wool to <i>teruma</i>, where this practice is prohibited. The Gemara answers: <b>We</b> already <b>established that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ilai.</b>
The Gemara challenges further: <b>If</b> one compares the first sheared wool to <i>teruma</i> by means of a verbal analogy, one can say that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i> we require</b> it to be <b>a first</b> gift <b>whose remainders are evident,</b> i.e., a part of the produce must remain after one has separated <i>teruma</i>, <b>so too, the first sheared wool</b> must be a gift <b>whose remainders are evident.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Yes,</b> it is indeed so.
The Gemara cites a proof for this claim. <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥalla</i> 1:9): With regard to <b>one who says: All my granary</b> shall be <b><i>teruma</i>, or: All my dough</b> shall be <b><i>ḥalla</i>,</b> he <b>has not said anything. But</b> one can infer from the mishna that if he said: <b>All my shearing</b> shall be designated as <b>first</b> sheared wool, <b>his declaration is valid. And</b> yet it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> tannaitic source, a <i>baraita</i>, that if he said: All my shearing shall be designated as first sheared wool, he <b>did not say anything.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the conflicting rulings that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ilai,</b> who compares the first sheared wool to <i>teruma</i>, <b>and that</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who do not compare the two cases? The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> here that this is correct.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Nowadays the universally</b> accepted <b>practice is in accordance with</b> the lenient rulings of <b>these three elders:</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ilai with regard to the first sheared wool, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ilai says:</b> The mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool applies only in Eretz</b> Yisrael.
<b>And</b> the accepted practice is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira with regard to matters of Torah, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says: Matters of Torah are not susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> Therefore, it is permitted for one who experienced a seminal emission to engage in Torah study even without first immersing in a ritual bath.
<b>And</b> lastly, the accepted practice is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya with regard to diverse kinds, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says: One</b> who sows diverse kinds <b>is never liable</b> by Torah law <b>until he sows wheat and barley and</b> a grape <b>pit with a single hand motion,</b> i.e., by sowing in the vineyard he violates the prohibitions of diverse kinds that apply to seeds and to the vineyard simultaneously.
§ The mishna states: There are more <b>stringent</b> elements <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>the foreleg,</b> the jaw, and the maw than in the mitzva of the first sheared wool. The mishna then proceeds to list a number of these stringent elements. The Gemara objects: <b>But let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that there is a more <b>stringent</b> element <b>in</b> the mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool, as</b> it <b>is in effect with regard to animals with a wound that will cause them to die within twelve months [<i>tereifot</i>],</b> but that <b>is not so with regard to the gifts</b> of the priesthood, i.e., the foreleg, the jaw, and the maw, which are not given to the priest from a <i>tereifa</i>. This is because the Torah states: “He shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3), whereas in the case of a <i>tereifa</i> the gifts are effectively not given to the priest himself but to his dog, as it is prohibited for the priest to eat them.
<b>Ravina said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon deems <i>tereifot</i> exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool. What is the reason for</b> the ruling of <b>Rabbi Shimon?</b> The reason is that he <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy between the term <b>giving</b> mentioned with regard to the first sheared wool and <b>giving from the gifts</b> of the priesthood. The Torah states: “Shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), with regard to the first sheared wool, and it states: “He shall give,” with regard to the gifts of the priesthood. <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood, one is <b>not</b> obligated to give them from <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> animal, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>the first sheared wool,</b> one is <b>not</b> obligated to give them from <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy between <b>giving</b> mentioned with regard to the first sheared wool and <b>giving from the gifts</b> of the priesthood, let him also <b>derive</b> a verbal analogy between <b>giving</b> mentioned with regard to the first sheared wool and <b>giving from <i>teruma</i>.</b> The Torah states: “The first fruits of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the first sheared wool of your flock shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> produce grown <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>yes,</b> it is obligated, whereas produce grown <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael is <b>not</b> obligated, <b>so too</b> with regard to the mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool: In Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>yes,</b> it applies, whereas <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael it does <b>not</b> apply. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>did we learn</b> in the mishna that the mitzva of <b>the first sheared wool applies</b> both <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather, this is</b> the <b>reason for</b> the ruling of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as he derives</b> a verbal analogy between the term <b>“flock [<i>tzon</i>]”</b> mentioned with regard to the first sheared wool and the term <b>“flock [<i>tzon</i>]” from</b> the animal <b>tithe.</b> With regard to the first sheared wool, the verse states: “And the first sheared wool of your flock [<i>tzonekha</i>], shall you give him” (Deuteronomy 18:4), and with regard to the animal tithe it states: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock [<i>tzon</i>], whichever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <b>tithe,</b> one is <b>not</b> obligated in the case of an animal that is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the first sheared wool,</b> one is <b>not</b> obligated in the case of <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And there,</b> with regard to the animal tithe, <b>from where do we</b> derive that it does not apply to a <i>tereifa</i>? The Gemara answers <b>that it is written: “Whichever passes under the rod,”</b> which <b>excludes a <i>tereifa</i>, which is not</b> able to <b>pass</b> under the rod due to its physical state. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But let</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>derive</b> a verbal analogy between the term <b>“flock [<i>tzon</i>]”</b> mentioned in this context and the term <b>“flock [<i>tzon</i>]” from</b> the mitzva to consecrate the male <b>firstborn</b> animal. In that context, the Torah states: “All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and of your flock [<i>tzonekha</i>] you shall sanctify to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 15:19). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the consecration of the <b>firstborn even a <i>tereifa</i></b> is consecrated, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>the first sheared wool</b> the obligation applies <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a <i>tereifa</i>.</b>
The Gemara answers: It <b>is reasonable</b> that Rabbi Shimon <b>should derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the first sheared wool <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of animal <b>tithe</b> rather than from the mitzva of the firstborn, <b>as</b> there are many <i>halakhot</i> that are common to both the first sheared wool and the animal tithe. The Gemara enumerates these <i>halakhot</i>: First, the first sheared wool and the animal tithe apply to both <b>male</b> and female animals, while the mitzva of the firstborn applies only to males. Furthermore, the first sheared wool and the animal tithe do not apply to <b>non-kosher</b> animals, whereas the sanctity of the firstborn also applies to donkeys, which are not kosher.
In addition, these two mitzvot both apply only in a case <b>of numerous</b> animals: The first sheared wool applies only if one shears no fewer than five sheep, and one must own at least ten animals to set aside the animal tithe, whereas the sanctity of the firstborn applies to a single animal. Another common feature is that unlike the firstborn, the first sheared wool and the animal tithe are not sanctified <b>from the womb,</b> but only once they are designated.
Moreover, both the first sheared wool and the animal tithe apply only to animals, whereas the sanctity of the firstborn also applies to a firstborn son in the case of <b>a man.</b> Likewise, these two mitzvot apply not only to firstborn animals but also to <b>ordinary</b> non-firstborn animals, unlike the sanctity of the firstborn. Finally, the first sheared wool and the animal tithe did not apply <b>before the</b> divine <b>word</b> was issued at the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai, whereas the sanctity of the firstborn already applied while the Jews were still in Egypt.
The Gemara responds: <b>On the contrary,</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>should derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the first sheared wool <b>from</b> the sanctity of the <b>firstborn</b> rather than from the animal tithe, <b>as</b> there are many <i>halakhot</i> common to the first sheared wool and the firstborn animal. The Gemara again enumerates the <i>halakhot</i> in common: Both apply to <b>an orphan</b> animal, i.e., one whose mother died before its birth, whereas the animal tithe does not apply to an animal of this kind. Furthermore, both mitzvot are in effect in the case of an animal <b>that one purchased,</b> whereas the animal tithe does not apply to a purchased animal.
In addition, both the mitzva of the first sheared wool and the mitzva of the firstborn animal apply to an animal owned <b>in partnership,</b> unlike the animal tithe. Both apply as well to an animal that one <b>gave</b> another as a gift, whereas the animal tithe does not apply in the case of a gift. Likewise, both apply even when not <b>in the presence of</b> the Temple, whereas the animal tithe is in effect only when the Temple is standing. Moreover, both the first sheared wool and the firstborn are given to <b>a priest,</b> whereas the animal tithe is eaten by the owner.

Daf 137a

The Gemara further states that the matter <b>of consecration</b> applies neither to the mitzva of the first sheared wool nor to the firstborn animal. The firstborn is consecrated from the womb, while the first sheared wool is non-sacred. By contrast, the animal tithe is consecrated by the owner when passed under the rod. <b>And</b> finally, the option of <b>sale</b> by the priest applies to the first sheared wool and the firstborn animal after the priest receives them, whereas the animal tithe may not be sold. The Gemara adds: <b>And these</b> <i>halakhot</i> common to the first sheared wool and the firstborn are <b>more numerous</b> than the <i>halakhot</i> shared by the first sheared wool and the animal tithe. Therefore, Rabbi Shimon should derive the verbal analogy between the first sheared wool and the firstborn.
The Gemara answers: Even so, Rabbi Shimon <b>prefers</b> to derive the <i>halakhot</i> of the first sheared wool, which apply to <b>an ordinary</b> non-firstborn animal, <b>from</b> those of animal tithe, which also apply to <b>an ordinary</b> animal. Rabbi Shimon maintains that the shared factor that the first sheared wool and the animal tithe apply to all animals, not only the first to emerge from the womb, is decisive and overrides the other shared <i>halakhot</i>.
§ The mishna states: <b>The first sheared wool is in effect only with regard to sheep.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy between <b>shearing</b> mentioned in this context and <b>shearing</b> mentioned elsewhere. It is <b>written here: “The first sheared wool of your flock [<i>tzonekha</i>], shall you give him”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:4), <b>and</b> it is <b>written there</b> that Job says concerning the needy: <b>“And he was warmed with the shearing of my sheep [<i>kevasai</i>]”</b> (Job 31:20). <b>Just as there,</b> the verse is referring specifically to the shearing of <b>sheep,</b> as the term <i>keves</i> is used only with regard to a sheep, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the first sheared wool, the verse is referring to <b>sheep,</b> despite the fact that the term <i>tzon</i> can be interpreted as referring also to goats.
The Gemara objects: <b>But derive</b> instead a verbal analogy concerning <b>shearing</b> mentioned in this context <b>from shearing</b> mentioned in the case of the <b>firstborn</b> animal: Just as the prohibition against shearing the firstborn also applies to a firstborn ox, so too, the <i>halakhot</i> of the first sheared wool should also apply to oxen. It is prohibited to shear a firstborn ox, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“You shall do no work with the firstborn of your ox, and you shall not shear the firstborn of your flock”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:19). From a straightforward reading of the verse, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that a firstborn <b>ox</b> may not be used <b>for labor and</b> that a firstborn of an animal from the <b>flock</b> may not be used <b>for shearing.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>to apply</b> the prohibition <b>that was stated about that</b> animal <b>to this</b> one, <b>and</b> the prohibition <b>that was stated about this</b> animal <b>to that</b> one? <b>The verse states: “You shall do no work…and you shall not shear.”</b> The conjunction “and” indicates that the two parts of the verse apply to both animals.
The Gemara explains: One cannot say that oxen are subject to the mitzva of first sheared wool, as the <b>verse states</b> with regard to this mitzva: <b>“Shall you give him,”</b> which indicates that the shearing is given to the priest himself, i.e., for him to wear, <b>and not for</b> use as <b>his sack.</b> The shearing of oxen is fit for use only as sackcloth, not as clothing.
The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so, let</b> one be obligated in the mitzva of the first sheared wool in the case of <b>goats’ hair,</b> as it too can be used for clothing. The Gemara explains: To be obligated in the first sheared wool <b>we require</b> an act of <b>shearing, and</b> goats’ hair is plucked, <b>not</b> sheared.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who did you hear</b> who accepts <b>this reasoning</b> that only an act of shearing renders one obligated in the mitzva of the first sheared wool? This is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> which the Gemara will soon cite. But <b>Rabbi Yosei concedes</b> that the obligation does exist without the act of shearing <b>in a case where the</b> usual <b>manner of</b> removing the wool is not by shearing. Since goats’ hair is not commonly shorn, the obligation of the first sheared wool should apply.
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara provides a different source for the mishna’s statement. The reason that the mitzva of first sheared wool applies only to sheep is <b>as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> It is stated in the verse following the source for the mitzva of first sheared wool: “For the Lord your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, <b>to stand to serve</b> in the name of the Lord, he and his sons forever” (Deuteronomy 18:5). The term “to serve” indicates that the first sheared wool that is given to the priest must consist of <b>a matter fit for</b> the Temple <b>service,</b> i.e., its size must be large enough for use for the priestly garments. <b>Here too,</b> the first sheared wool must be of <b>a matter fit for</b> Temple <b>service,</b> i.e., sheep’s wool, from which the priestly garments are woven.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>for what</b> purpose does the verbal analogy between <b>shearing</b> mentioned with regard to the first sheared wool and <b>shearing</b> mentioned with regard to the flock <b>come?</b> The Gemara answers: It is necessary <b>for that which was taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael. As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> In the case of <b>sheep whose wool is hard,</b> the owner is <b>exempt from the first sheared wool, as it is stated: “And he was warmed with the shearing of my sheep”</b> (Job 31:20). Since hard wool does not provide warmth, the mitzva of the first sheared wool does not apply to this wool.
§ It <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>shears goats, or washes sheep,</b> which causes some of their wool to be detached, he is <b>exempt</b> from the obligation of first sheared wool with regard to this wool. <b>And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who shears goats is exempt but</b> one who <b>washes the sheep</b> is <b>obligated</b> to separate the first sheared wool from the wool that was washed off. The Gemara resolves this apparent contradiction: It is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which requires one to separate the first sheared wool from the washed-off wool, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which exempts the washed off wool, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>
The Gemara cites the source of this dispute. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely remove the corner of your field when you reap, and you shall not gather the gleaning of your harvest; you shall leave them for the poor” (Leviticus 23:22). The phrase <b>“the gleaning of your harvest”</b> indicates that only such a gleaning is included, <b>and not gleaning from picking.</b> If one picks the crop by hand rather than harvesting it using agricultural tools, he is exempt from the mitzva to leave the gleanings for the poor. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Gleanings</b> are <b>only</b> those <b>that come due to harvesting</b> using agricultural tools.
The Gemara expresses puzzlement at this <i>baraita</i>: The opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>.</b> The Gemara explains: The <b>entire</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, and this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching:</b> The phrase “the gleaning of your harvest” teaches that crops picked by hand are exempt from the mitzva, <b>as Rabbi Yosei says: Gleanings</b> are <b>only</b> those <b>that come due to harvesting.</b> The Gemara infers that just as Rabbi Yosei interprets the term “harvest” as exempting crops that were picked by hand, so too he derives from the term “shearing” that the mitzva of the first sheared wool does not apply to fleece that was washed off. The Rabbis, who disagree with Rabbi Yosei with regard to the gleanings, likewise disagree with regard to the first sheared wool.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: Rabbi Yosei concedes</b> that the mitzva of gleanings applies <b>to a case where the</b> usual <b>manner</b> of harvesting is by picking, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse cited above that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> From the term <b>“harvest” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the obligation of gleanings with regard to <b>harvest. From where</b> do I derive the obligation of gleanings with regard to one who <b>uproots</b> the crop?
<b>The verse states:</b> “And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not completely remove the corner of your field by reaping, and you shall not gather the gleaning of your harvest” (Leviticus 19:9). The superfluous term <b>“by reaping”</b> includes uprooting the crop. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the obligation extends to one who <b>picked</b> the crop by hand? <b>The verse states: “When you reap”</b> (Leviticus 23:22), which is also superfluous. It is derived from here that the mitzva applies to all ways of gathering the crop, provided they are the usual manner of harvesting that particular crop.
<b>Ravina said to Ravi Ashi: We learn as well</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:4) that discusses the mitzva to leave produce in the corner of the field for the poor [<i>pe’a</i>]: If one has <b>garden beds of onions that are among the vegetables, Rabbi Yosei says</b> that one leaves separate <b><i>pe’a</i> from each and every one</b> of the beds. <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that one leaves <i>pe’a</i> <b>from one</b> garden bed <b>for all</b> of them. This indicates that Rabbi Yosei concedes that one is obligated to leave <i>pe’a</i> and gleanings from onions, despite the fact that they are picked by hand rather than harvested with tools. The reason is that this is the usual manner of gathering onions.
§ The mishna states: <b>And how many is numerous?</b> Beit Shammai say: It is at least two sheep, and Beit Hillel say: It is at least five sheep. The Gemara objects: <b>Granted,</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, two</b> sheep are <b>also called <i>tzon</i>,</b> as in the verse cited by Beit Shammai: “That a man shall rear a young cow and two sheep [<i>tzon</i>]” (Isaiah 7:21). Since the mitzva of the first sheared wool is written with regard to <i>tzon</i>, it is logical that it applies to two sheep. <b>But what is the reasoning of Beit Hillel,</b> who hold that the mitzva applies only to five sheep, due to the verse: “And five sheep [<i>tzon</i>] made” (I Samuel 25:18)? Why do they not apply the obligation using the broader criterion of two sheep, as the verse quoted by Beit Shammai clearly indicates that two sheep are also called <i>tzon</i>?
<b>Rav Kahana said:</b> The <b>verse states:</b> “Five sheep <b>made [<i>asuyot</i>],”</b> in plural. The plural form indicates <b>that two mitzvot</b> have been <b>made,</b> i.e., performed, with them. The two mitzvot are <b>the first sheared wool and</b> the <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood, a mitzva that applies to a single animal. If the two mitzvot have been performed only when there are five sheep, evidently the mitzva of the first sheared wool applies only to five sheep. The Gemara asks: Why can’t one <b>say</b> that the two mitzvot are the <b>firstborn</b> animal <b>and</b> the <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood?
The Gemara answers: The other mitzva cannot be the firstborn animal, as with regard to the <b>firstborn, isn’t one</b> animal <b>obligated,</b> i.e., doesn’t one animal render its owner obligated? Yet the verse states that one performs the two mitzvot only with five sheep. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> with regard to the <b>gifts</b> of the priesthood, <b>isn’t one</b> animal <b>obligated,</b> i.e., doesn’t one animal render its owner obligated?<b>Rather, Rav Ashi says:</b> The term <b>“made”</b> should be understood as meaning <b>that</b> five sheep <b>make their owner</b> perform the first sheared wool <b>and</b> figuratively <b>say to him: Stand</b> and <b>fulfill a mitzva,</b> whereas less than five sheep do not obligate their owner in the mitzva of first sheared wool.
It <b>was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei,</b> that he <b>says in the name of his father:</b> The obligation of the first sheared wool applies to one who owns <b>four</b> sheep, since a verse calls four sheep <i>tzon</i>, <b>as it is stated:</b> “If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it or sells it, he shall pay five oxen for the ox, <b>and four sheep [<i>tzon</i>] for a sheep”</b> (Exodus 21:37).
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Had their statements,</b> i.e., the opinions of Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, been based on <b>statements of the Torah, and the statement of the Distinguished One [<i>Beribbi</i>],</b> Rabbi Yosei, based on the texts of the <b>tradition [<i>kabbala</i>],</b> the Prophets and Writings, even so <b>we</b> would <b>listen</b> to <b>the statement of the Distinguished One,</b> Rabbi Yosei. <b>All the more so</b> now <b>that their statements</b> are based on <b>texts of the tradition,</b> as both Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel derived their rulings from verses from the Prophets, while <b>the statement of the Distinguished One,</b> Rabbi Yosei, is based on <b>the statements of the Torah.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But didn’t the Master say: The decision</b> of <b>a third</b> opinion that compromises between the first two opinions is <b>not</b> considered <b>decisive</b> if it is based on considerations that were not mentioned by the other two opinions. Although Rabbi Yosei’s opinion is a compromise between the opinions of Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, it is based on a different source.

Daf 137b

<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> in response: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi accepted Rabbi Yosei’s opinion not because it was a compromise, but rather because <b>he said it according to a tradition</b> he had <b>from</b> the prophets <b>Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</b>
§ The mishna states: <b>Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas says</b> that the mitzva of the first sheared wool applies to five sheep, each of whose shearing weighs one hundred and fifty dinars, whereas the Rabbis say: Five sheep, each of whose shearing is any amount. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is signified by the phrase: <b>Any amount? Rav says:</b> It is a total weight of <b>one hundred dinars</b> [<b><i>maneh</i></b>] <b>and half</b> of one hundred dinars [<b><i>peras</i></b>], <b>provided that they are divided</b> equally <b>between the five</b> sheep. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> It is a total weight of <b>sixty</b> <i>sela</i>, of which he <b>gives</b> the weight of <b>one <i>sela</i> to the priest.</b>
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is a total weight of <b>six</b> <i>sela</i>, of which he gives <b>to the priest</b> the weight of <b>five</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>and</b> he leaves <b>one</b> <i>sela</i> <b>for himself. Ulla</b> says that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: We learned</b> in the mishna that according to the Rabbis the obligation of the first sheared wool applies to <b>any amount,</b> even if the total weight is only one <i>sela</i>.
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna (135a): <b>And how much does one give to</b> the priest? One gives him sheared wool of the <b>weight</b> of <b>five <i>sela</i> in Judea, which are</b> the equivalent of <b>ten <i>sela</i> in the Galilee. Granted,</b> according <b>to</b> the opinions of <b>Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> the mishna <b>works out well,</b> as their statements do not contradict the mishna. Rav does not discuss the amount one is required to give the priest, and Rabbi Yoḥanan states that one gives the priest five <i>sela</i>. <b>But</b> according <b>to Shmuel and Rabbi Elazar,</b> the mishna is <b>difficult,</b> as Shmuel states that one is required to give one <i>sela</i>, while Rabbi Elazar states that the obligation of the first sheared wool applies even for a weight of less than five <i>sela</i>.
The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning, does it work out well</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav? But Rav and Shmuel both say</b> that <b>the first sheared wool</b> given to the priest is one part <b>in sixty.</b> Rav holds that the weight of one hundred and fifty dinars renders one obligated in the first sheared wool, and one-sixtieth of this weight is less than one <i>sela</i>. Therefore, Rav’s opinion is also not in accordance with the mishna.
The Gemara answers: <b>It was stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Rav and Shmuel both say:</b> The five <i>sela</i> stated in the mishna is not referring to the total amount given from the sheared wool. Rather, in the mishna <b>we are dealing with a Jew who has a large</b> amount of <b>shearing, and he wishes to give them to the priest,</b> i.e., to several priests. <b>And we say to him:</b> With regard to <b>each and every one</b> of the priests, do <b>not</b> give <b>him less than five <i>sela</i>.</b> But if one has only a small amount of shearing, he gives the priest one-sixtieth of the shearing, even if it is less than five <i>sela</i>.
§ The Gemara mentioned a ruling of Rav and Shmuel with regard to the amount that one is required to give as the first sheared wool. The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav and Shmuel both say: The first sheared wool</b> given to the priest is one part <b>of sixty.</b> Likewise, the amount one is required to separate as <b><i>teruma</i></b> is one part <b>of sixty,</b> and the amount one must leave in his field as <b><i>pe’a</i></b> is one part <b>of sixty.</b>
The Gemara asks: Is the amount one is required to separate as <b><i>teruma</i></b> one part <b>of sixty? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 4:3): With regard to the measure one should separate as <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> if one is of <b>generous disposition</b> he gives <b>one-fortieth.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>By Torah law,</b> it is sufficient to give one part <b>of sixty; by rabbinic law</b> the requisite amount is one part <b>of forty.</b>
The Gemara asks: Is the measure of <i>teruma</i> <b>by Torah law</b> one part <b>of sixty? But doesn’t Shmuel say:</b> By Torah law, even <b>one</b> grain of <b>wheat</b> given as <i>teruma</i> <b>exempts the</b> entire <b>pile [<i>keri</i>]</b> of grain? The Gemara answers: <b>By Torah law</b> the measure is <b>as</b> stated <b>by Shmuel,</b> that even one grain of wheat is sufficient. <b>By rabbinic law</b>, <b>with regard to</b> produce that is obligated in <i>teruma</i> <b>by Torah law</b> the measure is <b>one-fortieth,</b> whereas <b>by rabbinic law</b>, <b>with regard to</b> produce obligated in <i>teruma</i> <b>by rabbinic law</b> the measure is one part <b>of sixty.</b>
Rav and Shmuel said above that the amount one is required to leave in his field as <b><i>pe’a</i></b> is one part out <b>of sixty.</b> The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 1:1): <b>These are</b> the <b>matters,</b> i.e., mitzvot, <b>that have no measure: <i>Pe’a</i>, and the first fruits, and the</b> burnt offering of <b>appearance</b> sacrificed on the pilgrimage Festivals. The Gemara answers: <b>By Torah law,</b> <i>pe’a</i> <b>has no</b> fixed <b>measure; by rabbinic law</b> the measure is one part <b>of sixty.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the statement of Rav and Shmuel <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learn</b> in the subsequent mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 1:2): One should <b>not give for <i>pe’a</i> less than</b> one part <b>of sixty, even though they said</b> that <b>the</b> mitzva of <b><i>pe’a</i> has no measure.</b> The Gemara answers: The mishna <b>there</b> is referring to the obligation to leave <i>pe’a</i> <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael, whereas <b>here,</b> the statement of Rav and Shmuel is referring to the obligation of <i>pe’a</i> <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.
§ <b>When Isi bar Hini ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan found him teaching</b> the mishna <b>to his son.</b> Isi taught that the obligation of the first sheared wool applies only in the case of <b>sheep [<i>reḥelim</i>],</b> the masculine plural form of <i>raḥel</i>, meaning a sheep. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Isi: You should <b>teach him</b> using the term <b><i>reḥelot</i>,</b> the feminine plural form. Isi <b>said to him</b> in reply: I teach the mishna in accordance with <b>that which is written: “Two hundred <i>reḥelim</i>”</b> (Genesis 32:15). Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Isi: The <b>language</b> of the <b>Torah is distinct</b> and the <b>language</b> of the <b>Sages is distinct,</b> i.e., these are like two separate languages, and the Sages do not always use the same forms that appear in the Bible. In this case, they use <i>reḥelot</i> rather than <i>reḥelim</i>.
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Isi: <b>Who is the head of the yeshiva [<i>reish sidra</i>] in Babylonia?</b> Isi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: It is <b>Abba the tall,</b> i.e., the <i>amora</i> Rav. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Isi: <b>You call him Abba the tall,</b> in such a familiar manner? <b>I remember when I sat seventeen rows behind Rav,</b> who sat <b>before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and fiery sparks emerged from the mouth of Rav to the mouth of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and from the mouth of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>to the mouth of Rav, and I did not know what they said,</b> due to the profundity of their discussion. <b>And</b> yet <b>you call him Abba the tall?</b>
Isi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: With regard to <b>the first sheared wool, to how much</b> fleece does the mitzva apply? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to him:</b> The first sheared wool applies <b>to</b> fleece weighing <b>sixty</b> <i>sela</i>. Isi asked: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (135a) that the first sheared wool applies <b>to any amount</b> of fleece? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him</b> in reply: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the <i>halakha</i> could be understood by a simple reading of the mishna, <b>what</b> is the difference <b>between my</b> knowledge <b>and yours?</b> In fact, you know only the mishna’s statement, whereas I know the halakhic conclusion in this matter.
§ <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>the first sheared wool, Rav says</b> that the mitzva applies <b>to sixty</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan in the name of Rabbi Yannai says</b> that the mitzva applies <b>to six</b> <i>sela</i>. <b>Abaye said to Rav Dimi: You have made one</b> statement <b>work out well for us, but you have made another</b> statement <b>difficult for us.</b>
Abaye elaborates: <b>Granted,</b> you have resolved a contradiction between two statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan. Rabbi Yoḥanan said above that the amount of fleece to which the obligation of the first sheared wool applies is six <i>sela</i>, whereas in his answer to Isi he stated that the amount is sixty <i>sela</i>. According to Rav Dimi, the apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> statement <b>is his</b> and <b>that</b> statement <b>is his teacher’s.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that the obligation applies to sixty <i>sela</i>, whereas his teacher Rabbi Yannai maintains that it applies to six <i>sela</i>.
<b>But</b> the contradiction between one statement <b>of Rav and</b> another statement <b>of Rav</b> poses <b>a difficulty, as Rav said</b> that fleece weighing <b>one hundred dinars [<i>maneh</i>] and half</b> of one hundred dinars [<i>maneh</i>] is obligated in the first sheared wool, whereas Rav Dimi stated that according to Rav the obligation applies to sixty <i>sela</i>, which are 240 dinars. The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction between the one statement <b>of Rav and</b> the other statement <b>of Rav</b> is <b>also not difficult,</b> as <b>what</b> is the <b><i>maneh</i></b> of <b>which</b> Rav <b>said</b> that a <i>maneh</i> and a half are obligated? Rav was referring not to a <i>maneh</i> of one hundred dinars but to a <i>maneh</i> <b>of forty <i>sela</i>,</b> i.e., 160 dinars, a <i>maneh</i> and a half of <b>which is</b>

Daf 138a

equivalent to the weight <b>of sixty</b> <i>sela</i>, as stated by Rav Dimi. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> does <b>a <i>tanna</i> teach</b> that <b>a <i>maneh</i> is of forty <i>sela</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes; and we learned</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Kelim</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 6:2): With regard to <b>a new</b> leather <b>flask</b> that is not yet completely sewn together, <b>even though it can contain pomegranates,</b> nevertheless, because it cannot contain liquids it is considered unfinished and is <b>not susceptible to ritual impurity.</b>
If one <b>sewed</b> the flask together <b>and it tore,</b> the <b>measure</b> of the tear that renders the flask no longer susceptible to impurity is a hole large enough <b>to enable pomegranates to go out,</b> as then it ceases to serve as a vessel. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> The tear must be <b>like</b> the measure of <b>balls of a warp,</b> the weight of each of which is <b>one-quarter of a <i>maneh</i> of forty <i>sela</i>.</b> This <i>tanna</i> explicitly mentions a <i>maneh</i> of forty <i>sela</i>.
§ The mishna states: <b>And how much</b> of the sheared wool <b>does one give to</b> the priest? One gives him the weight of five <i>sela</i> in Judea, which are ten <i>sela</i> in the Galilee, once laundered and not when sullied. The Sages <b>taught:</b> The mishna does <b>not</b> mean <b>that one</b> must <b>launder</b> the wool <b>and</b> then <b>give it to</b> the priest; <b>rather,</b> the meaning is <b>that</b> one must give him enough wool for the <b>priest to launder it and it will amount to five <i>sela</i>.</b>
The mishna states: The measure that must be given to the priest is <b>enough to fashion a small garment</b> from it. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said:</b> The <b>verse</b> that follows the mention of the first sheared wool <b>states:</b> “For the Lord your God has chosen him out of all your tribes, <b>to stand to serve</b> in the name of the Lord, he and his sons forever” (Deuteronomy 18:5). The term “to serve” indicates that the first sheared wool given to the priest must be <b>a matter that is fitting for service</b> in the Temple, i.e., an amount of wool sufficient to fashion one of the priestly garments. <b>What is</b> the garment in question? It is the <b>belt,</b> which is made from wool weighing five <i>sela</i>.
The Gemara asks: Is the garment in question necessarily the belt? <b>Say</b> that it is the <b>robe,</b> which is fashioned from a far greater amount of wool. The Gemara answers: This inference is based on the principle that if <b>you grasped a lot you did not grasp</b> anything; if <b>you grasped a little, you grasped</b> something. Since a belt meets the condition of “to serve,” as it is one of the priestly vestments, one cannot say that the obligation is any greater than the amount of wool needed to fashion a belt.
<b>But say</b> that the garment in question is the <b>cap of wool</b> that the High Priest wears, which is smaller than the belt. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A cap of wool was placed on the High Priest’s head, and</b> the <b>frontplate was placed upon it, to fulfill that which is stated</b> with regard to the frontplate: <b>“And you shall put it on a thread of sky blue,</b> and it shall be upon the mitre; upon the forefront of the mitre it shall be” (Exodus 28:37). The term “thread of sky blue” is referring to the cap of sky-blue wool.
The Gemara answers that the <b>verse states:</b> “To stand to serve in the name of the Lord, <b>he and his sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 18:5), which indicates that the verse is referring to <b>a matter,</b> i.e., a garment, <b>that is equal for Aaron and for his sons.</b> The wool given to the priest must be of sufficient size for fashioning a garment worn both by the High Priest and by common priests, whereas the woolen cap is worn only by the High Priest.
The Gemara objects: But the <b>belt is also not equal</b> for all priests. The Gemara elaborates: <b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that the linen <b>belt of</b> the <b>High Priest</b> worn on Yom Kippur <b>is not</b> the same as <b>the belt of an ordinary priest.</b> According to this opinion, both the belt of common priests and the belt worn by the High Priest during the rest of the year were fashioned from a mixture of wool and linen. This belt is therefore equal for all priests, and it works out <b>well.</b>
<b>But according to the one who said</b> that the linen belt worn by the High Priest on Yom Kippur <b>is</b> the same as the <b>belt of an ordinary priest, what can be said?</b> According to this opinion, the belt fashioned from wool and linen is worn only by the High Priest during the rest of the year. The Gemara answers: Although the belts are different, the <b>term belt in general</b> applies to all priests, whereas no type of cap is worn by common priests.
§ The mishna states: If the owner of the shearing <b>did not manage to give it</b> to the priest until he dyed it, he is exempt from the obligation of giving the first sheared wool. The mishna further teaches that one who purchases the fleece of the sheep of a gentile is exempt from the obligation of the first sheared wool. It <b>was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to one who owned five sheep and he <b>sheared and sold the first</b> sheep before shearing the second, and in this manner sold each sheep after shearing it. When he finished shearing he owned the requisite five fleeces, to which the obligation of the first sheared wool applies, but he no longer owned the sheep. <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> He is <b>obligated</b> in the mitzva of the first sheared wool; and <b>Rabbi Natan bar Hoshaya says:</b> He is <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva of the first sheared wool.
The Gemara clarifies the two opinions. <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that he is <b>obligated, as</b> he <b>sheared</b> five sheep that he owned at the time of shearing, and therefore the term: “Your flock” (Deuteronomy 18:4), applies to this case. <b>Rabbi Natan bar Hoshaya says</b> that he is <b>exempt,</b> as <b>at the time that the measure</b> of five fleeces <b>is completed, we require</b> the term <b>“your flock”</b> to apply, since the obligation takes effect at that stage, <b>and</b> in this case it does <b>not</b> apply.
The Gemara raises a challenge: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna (135a): <b>One who purchases the fleece of the sheep of a gentile is exempt from</b> the obligation of <b>the first sheared wool,</b> as he purchased only the fleece but not the sheep. One can infer from here that if he purchased the gentile’s <b>sheep</b> themselves in order <b>to shear</b> them and then return them to the gentile, he is <b>obligated,</b> because the sheep belonged to him at the time of shearing. But <b>why</b> is he obligated, according to the opinion of Rabbi Natan bar Hoshaya? <b>Each and every one</b> of the sheep, <b>after</b> the <b>shearing</b> is completed, <b>leaves his possession,</b> and when he has sheared five sheep, the term “your flock” no longer applies to them.
<b>Rav Ḥisda interpreted</b> the mishna <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Natan bar Hoshaya:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the gentile <b>transferred ownership to him</b> for the <b>entire</b> period of <b>thirty days</b> during which the Jew sheared the sheep. Therefore, he retained ownership after he completed shearing, and the term “your flock” does apply to the sheep at the time when the obligation of the first sheared wool took effect.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>one who purchases the fleece of the sheep of another</b> Jew, if the seller kept some of the wool, then he is obligated to give the first sheared wool to the priest. If the seller did not keep any of the wool, the buyer is obligated to give it. The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that</b> in a case <b>where there is residual</b> wool <b>in</b> the possession of the <b>seller, we follow the seller</b> in determining who is obligated in the mitzva of first sheared wool?
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> who taught the mishna <b>is Rabbi Yehuda, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:5): With regard to <b>one who sells</b> a few fruit-bearing <b>tree stalks within his field,</b> without selling the field itself, for the buyer to uproot them and plant them in his own field, the buyer <b>gives</b> separate <b><i>pe’a</i> for each and every one</b> of the trees. The field does not combine the trees into a single unit for <i>pe’a</i>, as the land is not owned by the buyer.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> is it the buyer’s obligation to give <i>pe’a</i>? It is <b>when the owner of the field did not leave</b> any of the trees in his possession. <b>But</b> if <b>the owner of the field left</b> some of the trees in his possession, the owner <b>gives <i>pe’a</i> for all</b> the trees. Just as in the case of <i>pe’a</i>, if the seller left trees for himself then the obligation applies to him, so too, with regard to the first sheared wool, if the seller left some of the wool for himself, the obligation applies to him.
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: <b>But wasn’t it</b> you, <b>Master, who said</b> with regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s ruling that the owner gives <i>pe’a</i> for all the trees: <b>This is</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>when the owner of the field began to harvest</b> the fruit before he sold the trees, as the obligation to give <i>pe’a</i> had already applied to him. By contrast, with regard to the first sheared wool, the obligation came into effect only after he sold his sheep.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>so too,</b> with regard to the first sheared wool, <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> that the seller gives the first sheared wool applies only <b>if</b> the seller <b>began to shear</b> the sheep before he sold them, that explanation is difficult. The Gemara elaborates: <b>Granted, there,</b> with regard to <i>pe’a</i>, it <b>is written: “And when you reap the harvest of your land”</b> (Leviticus 19:9), which indicates that <b>from the time that he began to harvest he is obligated</b> in the mitzva of <i>pe’a</i> <b>with regard to the entire field. But here,</b> in the case of the first sheared wool, <b>he is not obligated with regard to the entire flock from the time that he began to shear</b> his sheep. Therefore, even if he began shearing before he sold the sheep, the obligation to give the first sheared wool should not apply to the seller.
<b>Rather, Rava said: It is this <i>tanna</i></b> who taught the mishna, <b>as we learned</b> in a different mishna (132a): If one <b>said to</b> a butcher: <b>Sell me the innards of this cow, and there were gifts</b> of the priesthood included <b>in them,</b> i.e., the maw, the purchaser <b>must give them to the priest, and</b> he <b>may not deduct</b> the value of the gifts <b>from the money</b> that he pays the butcher, as it is assumed that the gifts were not included in the sale. If <b>he purchased</b> the innards <b>from</b> the butcher <b>by weight,</b> the buyer <b>must give</b> the gifts <b>to a priest and</b> he <b>may deduct</b> the value of the gifts <b>from the money</b> that he pays the butcher. If the priestly gifts have not yet been separated from the animal, the price by weight includes the price of these gifts. But since the priests had the right to their gifts from the time of the slaughter, the buyer does not need to pay for them and may therefore deduct their value from his payment.

Daf 138b

<b>Evidently, a person does not sell the gifts</b> belonging <b>to</b> the <b>priest,</b> and therefore they are not included in the sale of the innards unless they were sold by weight. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to the first sheared wool, <b>a person does not sell the gifts</b> belonging <b>to</b> the <b>priest. Therefore,</b> if <b>the seller left</b> wool in his possession, the <b>seller is obligated</b> to give the first sheared wool from the remaining wool for that which he sold, <b>as</b> the <b>buyer</b> can <b>say to</b> the seller: The <b>gift of</b> the <b>priest is in your</b> possession, since you did not sell me everything. If the seller did <b>not leave</b> any wool in his possession, <b>the buyer is obligated</b> to give the first sheared wool and he does not deduct its value from the price, <b>as the seller</b> can <b>say to him: I did not sell the gift of</b> the <b>priest to you,</b> i.e., there was no obligation to give the gifts to a priest when I sold the wool to you, and therefore the buyer is required to give the gifts to the priest.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mitzva of <b>sending</b> away the mother bird from <b>the nest applies</b> both <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, and <b>in the presence of the Temple and not in the presence of the Temple.</b> It applies <b>to non-sacred</b> birds, <b>but</b> it does <b>not</b> apply <b>to sacrificial</b> birds. There are more <b>stringent</b> elements <b>in the covering of the blood than in the sending</b> away of the mother bird from <b>the nest, as the covering of the blood applies to undomesticated animals and birds, to</b> animals and birds that are readily <b>available</b> in one’s home, <b>and to</b> animals and birds <b>that are not</b> readily <b>available</b> and are hunted in the wild; <b>and the sending</b> of the mother bird from <b>the nest applies only to birds, and applies only to</b> birds <b>that are not</b> readily <b>available.</b>
<b>What are</b> considered birds <b>that are not</b> readily <b>available?</b> They are any birds, even domesticated, that may fly away at any time, <b>such as geese or chickens that nested in the orchard [<i>pardes</i>]. But if</b> geese or chickens <b>nested in the house, and likewise,</b> with regard to <b>domesticated pigeons [<i>yonei hardisei’ot</i>],</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother bird. With regard to the nest of <b>a non-kosher bird,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother bird. In a case where <b>a non-kosher bird is resting upon the eggs of a kosher bird, or a kosher</b> bird <b>is resting upon the eggs of a non-kosher bird,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the bird. With regard to <b>a male pheasant [<i>korei</i>],</b> which is known to sit upon the eggs like the female of its species, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> one <b>obligated</b> to send it away, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> one <b>exempt</b> from sending it away.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna contains several phrases related to the mitzva of sending away the mother bird from the nest that also appear in the first mishna of several other chapters of this tractate. With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Avin and Rabbi Meyasha</b> made the following statements. <b>One</b> of them <b>said: Anywhere</b> in this tractate <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna that a particular mitzva applies both <b>in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, it is stated <b>needlessly,</b> as those mitzvot are not related to land, such that there is no need to teach that they apply outside of Eretz Yisrael as well. This is true <b>except for</b> the mitzva of <b>the first shearing</b> of wool, which one must give to a priest. It was necessary to teach that that mitzva applies even outside of Eretz Yisrael, <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ilai, who said: The first shearing is in effect only in Eretz</b> Yisrael.
<b>And</b> the other <b>one said: Anywhere</b> in this tractate <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna that a particular mitzva applies both <b>in the presence of the Temple and not in the presence of the Temple,</b> it is stated <b>needlessly,</b> as these mitzvot are requirements of the object itself, and there is no need to teach that they apply even after the destruction of the Temple. This is true <b>except for</b> the prohibition against slaughtering an animal <b>itself and its offspring</b> on the same day. It was necessary to teach that this mitzva applies even after the destruction of the Temple, because it might <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> this prohibition <b>is written in</b> a passage in the Torah discussing <b>the matter of sacrificial</b> animals (see Leviticus, chapter 22), <b>at a time when there are sacrificial</b> animals, i.e., when the Temple is standing, <b>we will abide</b> by it, but <b>at a time when there are no sacrificial</b> animals, after the destruction of the Temple, <b>we will not abide</b> by it. Therefore, that mishna <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so.
<b>And both of them said: Anywhere</b> in this tractate <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna that a particular mitzva applies both <b>to non-sacred</b> animals <b>and to sacrificial</b> animals, it is stated <b>necessarily.</b> This is the case <b>except for</b> the mishna discussing the <b>sciatic nerve,</b> as it is <b>obvious</b> that the prohibition applies to sacrificial animals as well. Can it enter one’s mind to say that <b>because it was consecrated, the prohibition of</b> eating <b>the sciatic nerve is abrogated from</b> the animal?
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we establish</b> that the mishna there (89b) is referring <b>to offspring of sacrificial</b> animals? Without the mishna, one might have thought that since the offspring was already prohibited as a sacrificial animal before its sciatic nerve was even formed, the prohibition with regard to the latter does not take effect where the former prohibition already exists. If so, it was in fact necessary to teach this <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara responds: <b>But what is the reason we interpreted</b> that mishna as referring to offspring of sacrificial animals? Is it <b>not due to</b> the fact that the question: <b>Let</b> the mishna <b>not teach</b> that the prohibition applies to both non-sacred and sacrificial animals, is <b>difficult for us?</b> It is in response to this question that Rabbi Avin and Rabbi Meyasha stated that <b>even from the outset,</b> this <b>should not</b> pose a <b>difficulty for you.</b> Rather, <b>since</b> the phrase: Applies to both non-sacred and sacrificial animals, <b>is taught necessarily</b> with regard to the prohibition against slaughtering an animal itself and its offspring, it <b>is also taught needlessly</b> with regard to the prohibition against eating the sciatic nerve, to parallel the formula of the other mishna.
§ The mishna states that the mitzva of sending away the mother bird from the nest applies <b>to non-sacred</b> birds, <b>but not to sacrificial</b> birds. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does this mitzva <b>not</b> apply to sacrificial birds? The Gemara responds: <b>As the verse states: “You shall send the mother”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7). The verse refers only <b>to</b> a bird <b>that you are commanded to send</b> away, i.e., a non-sacred bird; that <b>excludes this</b> sacrificial bird, <b>which you are not commanded to send</b> away, but <b>rather to bring it to the custody of</b> the Temple <b>treasurer.</b>
<b>Ravina says: Therefore,</b> with regard to <b>a kosher bird that killed a person</b> and must now be executed, one <b>is exempt from sending</b> it away. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>as the verse states: “You shall send the mother.”</b> The verse is referring only <b>to</b> a bird <b>that you are commanded to send</b> away, which <b>excludes this</b> bird <b>that you are not commanded to send</b> away, but <b>rather to bring it to court.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case, i.e., how is this bird that killed a person now resting on its eggs? <b>If</b> this is a case <b>where its verdict</b> of execution <b>was issued,</b>

Daf 139a

how could it be free to rest on its eggs? <b>It is subject</b> to being <b>killed</b> and should have been executed. <b>Rather,</b> it must be a case <b>where its verdict was not</b> yet <b>issued, and</b> one is <b>required to bring it to the court to fulfill through it</b> the verse: <b>“And you shall eradicate the evil from your midst”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:6).
§ With regard to the statement of the mishna that sacrificial birds are not included in the mitzva of sending away the mother bird from the nest, the Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of these sacrificial</b> birds discussed in the mishna? <b>If we say that</b> the mishna is referring to a case where one <b>had a nest in his house and consecrated it, is one obligated</b> to send away even a non-sacred bird in such a case? The verse states: <b>“If a bird’s nest happens</b> before you on the way” (Deuteronomy 22:6), which <b>excludes</b> a nest readily <b>available</b> in one’s home.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>merely saw a nest</b> that did not belong to him, <b>and he consecrated it. But</b> this, too, is problematic: <b>Is</b> the nest <b>consecrated</b> in such a case? But <b>the Merciful One states: “When a man shall sanctify his house to be holy”</b> (Leviticus 27:14), indicating that <b>just as his house</b> is <b>in his possession</b> when he consecrates it, <b>so too, any</b> item that one wishes to consecrate must be <b>in his possession</b> when consecrating it. If so, one cannot consecrate a nest that does not belong to him.
<b>Rather,</b> say that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>lifted</b> the <b>chicks,</b> taking possession of them, <b>and</b> then <b>consecrated them, and then returned them</b> to the nest. But <b>this</b> too cannot be, as <b>even with regard to non-sacred</b> birds one <b>is not obligated</b> to send the mother away in such a case, <b>as is taught</b> in a mishna (141a): If one sent the mother away and <b>took the offspring and</b> then <b>returned them to the nest, and thereafter, the mother returned</b> and rested <b>upon them,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> the mother bird away, because he has acquired the offspring and they are now considered readily available.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather,</b> say that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>lifted the mother,</b> taking possession of her, <b>and</b> then <b>consecrated her, and</b> thereafter <b>returned her</b> to the nest. The Gemara responds that this too cannot be, because <b>he was initially obligated in</b> the <b>sending</b> away of the mother bird <b>before he consecrated her.</b> Consequently, the consecration of the bird afterward cannot abrogate the requirement to send it away, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Yosef says:</b> If one <b>consecrated an undomesticated animal and then slaughtered it,</b> he is <b>exempt from covering</b> its blood, because a consecrated animal is not subject to the obligation of covering the blood. But if he <b>slaughtered it and then consecrated it,</b> he is <b>obligated to cover</b> its blood, <b>as he was already obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>covering</b> of the blood <b>before it came into the possession of the Temple</b> treasury.
Rather, <b>Rav says:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to</b> a case of one who <b>consecrates the fruit,</b> i.e., the chicks, <b>of his dovecote</b> for sacrifice on the altar, <b>and they</b> later <b>rebelled</b> and fled from the dovecote and nested elsewhere. The mishna teaches that although such birds are not considered readily available, one is exempt from sending away the mother because they are sacrificial birds. If they were non-sacred, one who finds them would be obligated to do so. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to</b> a case of one who <b>consecrates his chicken for Temple maintenance,</b> and the chicken later rebelled and fled its owner’s home and established a nest elsewhere.
The Gemara objects: <b>Granted, Shmuel did not state</b> his explanation of the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> that of <b>Rav, since he interprets it</b> as referring even <b>to</b> birds <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance,</b> which do not have inherent sanctity. Accordingly, the mishna teaches that all consecrated birds are not included in the mitzva of sending away the mother bird. <b>But what is the reason</b> that <b>Rav did not state</b> his explanation <b>in accordance with</b> that of <b>Shmuel?</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: I specifically exempted</b> one <b>from sending</b> the mother bird away in a case <b>where</b> the birds are the <b>fruit of his dovecote, as they are consecrated for</b> the <b>altar. Since they are consecrated</b> with <b>inherent sanctity, their sanctity is not abrogated from them</b> even when they flee from the dovecote. <b>But in</b> a case where one <b>consecrates his chicken for Temple maintenance, where</b> the chicken is <b>not consecrated for</b> the <b>altar but merely</b> has <b>sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value, once it rebels its sanctity is abrogated, and it is obligated in,</b> i.e., subject to, the mitzva of <b>sending</b> away the mother bird.
<b>And Shmuel</b> could have <b>said:</b> Though it has rebelled, the chicken retains its sanctity, since <b>wherever it is, it is in the treasury [<i>bei gazza</i>] of the Merciful One, as it is written: “The earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness thereof”</b> (Psalms 24:1). <b>And so Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that the mishna is referring <b>to</b> a case where one <b>consecrated his chicken for Temple maintenance, and</b> the chicken then <b>rebelled. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said to him: But once it rebels, its sanctity is abrogated.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> Wherever it is, <b>it is in the treasury of the Merciful One, as it is written: “The earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness thereof.”</b>
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> here <b>and that of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> elsewhere, <b>and</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between the statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> here <b>and that of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> elsewhere.
<b>As</b> it <b>was stated:</b> If one declares that <b>these one hundred dinars</b> are consecrated <b>for Temple maintenance, and they were stolen or lost, Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He bears responsibility for them until they come into the</b> physical <b>possession of the</b> Temple <b>treasurer [<i>gizbar</i>].</b> Consequently, he must pay one hundred dinars to the treasury. <b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> One is not required to replace the lost money, since <b>wherever it is, it is in the treasury of the Merciful One, as it is written: “The earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness.”</b> Accordingly, the money is considered to have entered the possession of the treasury. If so, this statement <b>of Reish Lakish</b> poses <b>a difficulty for</b> the other statement <b>of Reish Lakish,</b> and this statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> poses <b>a difficulty for</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>
The Gemara responds: The apparent contradiction between this statement <b>of Reish Lakish</b> and that statement <b>of Reish Lakish</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, that the sanctity of a consecrated chicken that rebelled is abrogated, was made <b>before he heard</b> the statement <b>from Rabbi Yoḥanan, his teacher,</b> that wherever it is, it is in God’s treasury. <b>That</b> statement, that one is not liable to replace the missing consecrated funds, was made <b>after he heard</b> that statement <b>from Rabbi Yoḥanan his teacher.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> still, this statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> poses <b>a difficulty</b> for that statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> The Gemara responds: The apparent contradiction between this statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and that statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is <b>also not difficult. This</b> statement, that one bears responsibility for the missing consecrated funds, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the consecrator <b>said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring one hundred dinars to the Temple treasury. In such a case, one bears responsibility for the money until it reaches the Temple treasurer. <b>That</b> statement, that a consecrated chicken that rebelled remains consecrated, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the consecrator <b>said: This</b> chicken <b>is</b> consecrated for Temple maintenance. In such a case, the sanctity is not abrogated even after the chicken flees, because wherever it is, it is in God’s treasury.
The Gemara objects: If it is so that when Rabbi Yoḥanan says that one bears financial responsibility for the missing consecrated funds, he is referring to a case where one said: It is incumbent upon me, <b>by inference</b> one may conclude <b>that</b> according to <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> who says that one does not bear responsibility for the money, one <b>does not bear</b> financial responsibility <b>even though</b> one <b>said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me.</b>
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Kinnim</i> 1:1): <b>Which is</b> the case of <b>a vow</b> offering, <b>and which is</b> the case of <b>a gift</b> offering? <b>A vow</b> offering is where <b>one says: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt offering. A gift</b> offering is where <b>one says: This</b> animal is <b>a burnt offering. And what is</b> the difference <b>between a vow</b> offering <b>and a gift</b> offering? With regard to <b>a vow</b> offering, if <b>it died or was stolen or lost,</b> one <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for it.</b> With regard to <b>a gift</b> offering, if <b>it died or was stolen or lost,</b> one <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for it.</b>
The Gemara responds that <b>Reish Lakish</b> could have <b>said to you: This statement,</b> that one who says: It is incumbent upon me, bears financial responsibility, applies only to an item <b>consecrated for the altar, since</b> one vowed to sacrifice it as an offering and <b>it has not yet been sacrificed. But</b> with regard to an item <b>consecrated for Temple maintenance, which is not lacking sacrifice</b> on the altar, <b>even though</b> one <b>said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me,</b> one <b>does not bear</b> financial responsibility for it.
The Gemara objects: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 20b) that in the case of <b>one who says: This bull</b> is consecrated as <b>a burnt offering, or: This house</b> is consecrated as <b>an offering,</b> and <b>the bull died</b> or <b>the house collapsed, he does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for them;</b> but in the case of one who says: It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to give <b>this bull</b> as <b>a burnt offering, or:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to give <b>this house</b> as <b>an offering,</b> if <b>the bull died</b> or <b>the house collapsed,</b> he is <b>obligated to pay</b> its value? Evidently, even with regard to items consecrated for Temple maintenance, if one says: It is incumbent upon me, one bears financial responsibility for them.
The Gemara responds: With regard to <b>this statement,</b> that if one says: It is incumbent upon me to give an item for Temple maintenance, he bears financial responsibility, that applies only <b>where the bull died or the house collapsed.</b> In such a case <b>he is obligated to pay, since they no</b> longer <b>exist. But where they</b> still <b>exist,</b> e.g., in the case of an item or sum of money that was lost or stolen, one applies the principle: <b>Wherever it is, it is in the treasury of the Merciful One, as it is written: “The earth is the Lord’s, and its fullness thereof.”</b>
§ The Gemara above cited a dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish as to the <i>halakha</i> about one who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring an item for Temple maintenance. With regard to this dispute, <b>Rav Hamnuna says: Everyone concedes with regard to valuations</b> that <b>even if one said:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate my own valuation, and one set aside money that was then lost or stolen, one <b>does not bear</b> financial responsibility for it. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>because it cannot be stated by him without</b> stating: <b>Upon me.</b> In other words, one cannot say: This is my valuation, since he has yet to accept upon himself any such obligation.
Therefore, although one says: It is incumbent upon me to donate my valuation, this is not considered an acceptance of financial responsibility. After all, <b>how shall he say</b> it without stating: It is incumbent upon me? <b>Shall he say</b> only: <b>My own valuation,</b> without: Is incumbent upon me? If so, <b>upon whom</b> is the obligation placed to pay the money? Or <b>shall he say</b> only: <b>The valuation of so-and-so?</b> Still, <b>upon whom</b> is the obligation placed to pay the money?
<b>Rava objects to this: Let him say: I am</b> encumbered <b>with my own valuation,</b> or: <b>I am</b> encumbered <b>with the valuation of so-and-so.</b> One need not say: Is incumbent upon me. <b>Additionally, it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the redemption of a purchased field that was consecrated that <b>Rabbi Natan says</b> about the verse: “Then the priest shall reckon for him the worth of your valuation until the Jubilee Year, <b>and he shall give your valuation on that day, as a consecrated thing to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:23): <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state:</b> “And he shall give your valuation”? It could have stated simply: And he shall give it. It is necessary <b>because we have found with regard to consecrated</b> property <b>and tithes that they can be desacralized</b> by transferring their sanctity <b>onto non-sacred money,</b> and that if that money <b>was stolen or lost,</b> the owners <b>do not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for it.</b>

Daf 139b

One <b>might</b> have thought that with regard to <b>this</b> valuation <b>too,</b> the <i>halakha</i> should be <b>so,</b> i.e., if money from a valuation is stolen or lost, the owner does not bear financial responsibility for it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he shall give your valuation</b> on that day,” indicating that the valuation money is <b>non-sacred until it enters the possession of</b> the Temple <b>treasurer,</b> and that the owner bears responsibility for it until that time. Evidently, even with regard to valuations, the consecrator bears financial responsibility, in contradiction to the statement of Rav Hamnuna.
<b>Rather, if</b> a statement <b>was stated, this</b> is what <b>was stated: Rav Hamnuna says</b> that <b>everyone concedes with regard to valuations that even if</b> one <b>did not say:</b> It is incumbent <b>upon me,</b> one <b>bears</b> financial responsibility for it, <b>as it is written: “And he shall give your valuation,”</b> indicating that the valuation money is <b>non-sacred until it enters the possession of</b> the Temple <b>treasurer.</b>
§ The mishna states: There are more <b>stringent</b> elements <b>in the covering</b> of the blood than in the sending away of the mother from the nest, as the covering of the blood applies to undomesticated animals and birds, to animals and birds that are readily available in one’s home, and to animals and birds that are not readily available; and the sending of the mother from the nest applies only to birds that are not readily available. With regard to the mitzva of sending away the mother, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“If a bird’s nest happens before you</b> on the way, in any tree or on the ground, with fledglings or eggs, and the mother is resting upon the fledglings, or upon the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young; you shall send the mother, but the young you may take for yourself” (Deuteronomy 22:6–7). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> all the various details contained in it?
<b>Since it is stated: “You shall send [<i>shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ</i>] the mother, but the young you may take for yourself,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the doubled verb “<i>shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ</i>” indicates that one must <b>search</b> even <b>in the mountains and hills in order to find a nest</b> with which to perform this mitzva. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “If</b> a bird’s nest <b>happens,”</b> indicating that one is obligated to send away the mother only <b>when it confronts you;</b> one is not required to seek out a nest.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The word <b>“nest”</b> indicates that this mitzva applies <b>in any case,</b> even to a nest with only a single chick or egg. The word <b>“bird’s”</b> indicates that the mitzva applies only to <b>kosher</b> birds, <b>and not</b> to <b>non-kosher</b> birds. The term <b>“before you”</b> indicates that the mitzva applies to a nest that is <b>on private property,</b> e.g., an unguarded orchard or field, such that the owner’s property does not acquire the nest for him. The term <b>“on the way”</b> indicates that the mitzva also applies to a nest found <b>in a public thoroughfare. From where</b> is it derived that the mitzva also applies to nests found <b>in trees? The verse states: “In any tree.”</b> And with regard to nests found <b>in pits, ditches, and caves, from where</b> is it derived that the mitzva also applies to them? <b>The verse states: “Or on the ground,”</b> indicating that the mitzva applies to a nest on any type of ground.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And since, in the end, we will include everything,</b> i.e., every location of the nest, from the verse: “In any tree or on the ground,” <b>why do I</b> need the earlier statement: <b>“Before you on the way”?</b> It is <b>to say to you: Just as</b> a nest on the <b>way</b> is a case in <b>which</b> the bird’s <b>nest is not in your possession</b> and is not readily available for you, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>all</b> other cases, one is obligated only <b>when its nest is not in your possession. From here</b> the Sages <b>stated:</b> With regard to <b>pigeons of a dovecote or pigeons of an attic that nested in</b> small <b>wall niches or in buildings, and geese or chickens that nested in an orchard, one is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>sending</b> the mother bird away, because such birds are not in one’s possession. <b>But</b> with regard to birds that <b>nested inside the house, and likewise</b> with regard to <b>domesticated pigeons, one is exempt from</b> the mitzva of <b>sending</b> the mother bird away.
§ The Gemara analyzes the above <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said: Just as</b> a nest on the <b>way</b> is a case in <b>which</b> the bird’s <b>nest is not in your possession, so too,</b> with regard to <b>all</b> other cases, one is obligated only <b>when its nest is not in your possession.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>this</b> derivation? <b>It</b> may be <b>derived from: “If</b> a bird’s nest <b>happens,”</b> as it is taught: <b>“If</b> a bird’s nest <b>happens” excludes</b> a nest that is readily <b>available. And furthermore, why do I</b> need the term <b>“before you”</b> to include even a nest found on private property? It is already derived from the verse: “In any tree or on the ground.”
<b>Rather,</b> the term <b>“before you”</b> is necessary <b>to include</b> a case <b>where</b> the birds <b>were before you,</b> i.e., they had an owner and were readily available to him, <b>and</b> they then <b>rebelled</b> and fled and nested elsewhere. <b>“On the way”</b> is necessary for <b>that which Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said, as Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> If one <b>found a nest in the sea,</b> e.g., in a case where a tree was washed out to sea with a nest in its branches, one <b>is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>sending</b> the mother bird away, <b>as it is stated: “So said the Lord, who makes a way in the sea,</b> and a path in the mighty waters” (Isaiah 43:16). The term “way” applies even to the sea.
The Gemara challenges: <b>If that is so,</b> then if <b>one found a nest in the sky,</b> e.g., in a case where a bird carries the nest as it flies, about <b>which it is written: “The way of an eagle in the sky”</b> (Proverbs 30:19), one should <b>also be obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>sending</b> away the mother bird from <b>the nest.</b> The Gemara responds: The sky <b>is called “the way of an eagle,”</b> but <b>it is not called: A way,</b> in <b>an unspecified</b> manner. The sea, by contrast, is referred to simply as: A way.
§ <b>The</b> residents <b>of Pappunya said to Rav Mattana:</b> If one <b>found a nest on the head of a person, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the mitzva of sending away the mother? Is the nest considered to be on the ground, such that one is obligated in the mitzva? Rav Mattana <b>said</b> to them that one is obligated in the mitzva in such a case because the verse states: <b>“And earth upon his head”</b> (II Samuel 15:32), rather than: Dirt upon his head, indicating that one’s head is considered like the ground. They also asked Rav Mattana: <b>From where in the Torah</b> is the existence of <b>Moses [<i>Moshe</i>]</b> alluded to before his birth? He replied that the verse states: <b>“For that he also [<i>beshaggam</i>] is flesh;</b> therefore shall his days be one hundred and twenty years” (Genesis 6:3). The numerical value of <i>beshaggam</i> is the same as that of the Hebrew name <i>Moshe</i>, and it is known that Moses lived a total of 120 years (see Deuteronomy 34:7).
They also asked Rav Mattana: <b>From where in the Torah</b> can one find an allusion to the hanging of <b>Haman?</b> He replied: The verse states after Adam ate from the tree of knowledge: <b>“Have you eaten of [<i>hamin</i>] the tree,</b> about which I commanded you that you should not eat?” (Genesis 3:11). <i>Hamin</i> is spelled in the same manner as Haman: <i>Heh</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>nun</i>.
They also asked Rav Mattana: <b>From where in the Torah</b> can one find an allusion to the events involving <b>Esther?</b> He replied to them that the verse states: “Then My anger shall be kindled against them on that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide My face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come upon them; so that they will say in that day: Have not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us? <b>And I will hide [<i>haster astir</i>]</b> My face on that day for all the evil which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned to other gods” (Deuteronomy 31:17–18). They also asked him: <b>From where in the Torah</b> can one find an allusion to the greatness bestowed upon <b>Mordecai?</b> He replied: <b>As it is written</b> with regard to the anointing oil in the Tabernacle: “And you shall also take the chief spices, of <b>flowing myrrh [<i>mor deror</i>]”</b> (Exodus 30:23); <b>and we translate</b> <i>mor deror</i> into Aramaic as: <b><i>Mira dakhya</i>,</b> which resembles the name Mordecai.
§ The mishna states: <b>And which</b> are considered birds <b>that are not</b> readily <b>available?</b> They are any birds such as geese or chickens that nested in the orchard. But if the geese or chickens nested in the house, one is exempt from sending them away, and likewise with regard to domesticated pigeons. The Gemara relates: With regard to the correct name of the domesticated pigeons referred to in the mishna, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon</b> disagree. <b>One teaches</b> that the correct name is <i>yonei <b>hadrisei’ot</b></i><b>, and</b> the other <b>one teaches</b> that the correct name is <i>yonei <b>hardisei’ot</b></i><b>.</b> According to the <b>one who teaches</b> that the correct name is <i>yonei <b>hardisei’ot</b></i><b>,</b> they are called so <b>on account of</b> King <b>Herod,</b> who was involved in breeding these pigeons; <b>and</b> according to the <b>one who teaches</b> that the correct name is <i>yonei <b>hadrisei’ot</b></i><b>,</b> they are called so <b>on account of their location.</b>
<b>Rav Kahana said: I myself saw</b> these pigeons, <b>and they</b> were <b>standing</b> in <b>sixteen rows,</b> each <b>a <i>mil</i> wide, and they were calling</b> out: <b>My master, my master. There was one of them who was not calling</b> out: <b>My master, my master. Another</b> one <b>said to it: Blind</b> one, i.e., fool, <b>say: My master, my master,</b> so that you will not be punished for refusing to acknowledge the authority of the king. The pigeon <b>said</b> in response: <b>Blind</b> one, you should <b>say: My master, my slave,</b> as Herod is not a king but a slave. <b>They brought</b> that pigeon to a slaughterhouse <b>and slaughtered it</b> for speaking against the king.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Rabbi Ḥanina said to me:</b> This story is no more than mere <b>words,</b> as no such incident took place. The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that Rabbi Ḥanina dismisses as mere <b>words</b> an incident reported by Rav Kahana? <b>Rather, say</b> that Rabbi Ḥanina said that those pigeons acted as described above <b>through words</b> of witchcraft.
§ The mishna states: If one encounters a nest of <b>a non-kosher bird,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother bird. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: As the verse states: “If a bird’s [<i>tzippor</i>] nest happens before you”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:6), and not: If a bird’s [<i>of</i> ] nest happens before you. The word <b><i>of</i> indicates to us</b> that all birds are included, <b>whether kosher or non-kosher.</b> But with regard to the word <b><i>tzippor</i>, we have found</b> that <b>a kosher</b> bird <b>is called a <i>tzippor</i>,</b> but <b>we have not found</b> that <b>a non-kosher</b> bird <b>is called a <i>tzippor</i>.</b>
The Gemara attempts to reject the above assertion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is stated in the verse with regard to the prohibition against fashioning idols: <b>“The likeness of any winged bird [<i>tzippor</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:17). <b>What, is it not</b> that the word <b>“<i>tzippor</i>”</b> is referring to any bird, <b>whether kosher or non-kosher,</b> and the word <b>“winged”</b> adds the likeness of <b>grasshoppers</b> to the prohibition? If so, we have found that a non-kosher bird is called a <i>tzippor</i>. The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> the word <b>“<i>tzippor</i>”</b> means <b>a kosher</b> bird, while the word <b>“winged”</b> is referring to <b>non-kosher</b> birds <b>and</b> to <b>grasshoppers.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is stated in the passage describing how all of creation praises God: <b>“The undomesticated animal and all domesticated animals, creeping things and winged birds [<i>tzippor</i>]”</b> (Psalms 148:10). <b>What, is it not</b> that the word <b>“<i>tzippor</i>”</b> is referring to all birds, <b>whether kosher or non-kosher, and</b> the word <b>“winged”</b> is referring to <b>grasshoppers?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> the word <b>“<i>tzippor</i>”</b> means <b>a kosher</b> bird, while the word <b>“winged”</b> is referring to <b>non-kosher</b> birds <b>and</b> to <b>grasshoppers.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is stated in the verse about the animals that entered Noah’s ark: <b>“Every bird [<i>tzippor</i>] of every type of wing”</b> (Genesis 7:14). <b>What, is it not</b> the same <b>difficulty that we posed</b> previously, that the word “<i>tzippor</i>” is referring to all birds, kosher and non-kosher, and the word “wing” is referring to grasshoppers? The Gemara rejects this as well: <b>No,</b> it is actually <b>as we resolved</b> it, that the word “<i>tzippor</i>” is referring only to kosher birds, and the word “wing” is referring to non-kosher birds and to grasshoppers.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is stated in the passage describing the war of Gog and Magog: <b>“And you, son of man,</b> so said the Lord God: <b>Speak to the birds [<i>tzippor</i>] of every type of wing,</b> and to every animal of the field: Assemble yourselves, and come” (Ezekiel 39:17). <b>What, is it not</b> the same <b>difficulty that we posed</b> previously? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is actually <b>as we resolved</b> it.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is

Daf 140a

stated in the verse describing a tree: <b>“And in its branches will dwell the birds [<i>tzipparei</i>] of the heaven”</b> (Daniel 4:9). The verse states only: “The birds [<i>tzipparei</i>],” and not: The birds of any type of wing. Accordingly, the term “the birds [<i>tzipparei</i>]” must be referring to all birds, whether kosher or non-kosher, since all birds dwell in tree branches. The Gemara rejects this: Non-kosher birds <b>are called: Birds [<i>tzipparei</i>] of the heaven,</b> but <b>they are not called: <i>Tzipparei</i>,</b> in <b>an unspecified</b> manner.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is stated in the passage discussing kosher and non-kosher animals: <b>“Every kosher bird [<i>tzippor</i>]</b> you may eat” (Deuteronomy 14:11). Since it was necessary for the verse to specify that it is referring to a kosher bird [<i>tzippor</i>], <b>by inference,</b> one may conclude <b>that there is a non-kosher</b> bird [<i>tzippor</i>], in contradiction to the statement of Rabbi Yitzḥak. The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> this is not the correct inference. Rather, <b>by inference</b> one may conclude <b>that there is</b> a <i>tzippor</i> that is <b>prohibited</b> for consumption, despite its being a kosher bird.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this kosher bird whose prohibition must be derived from this verse? <b>If</b> it is a bird <b>with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> that would be superfluous, as that <b>is written explicitly</b> in the verse: “An unslaughtered animal carcass, or a <i>tereifa</i>, he shall not eat” (Leviticus 22:8). <b>And if</b> it is referring <b>to the slaughtered</b> bird from the purification ritual <b>of a leper,</b> which is prohibited for consumption despite being kosher, that would also be superfluous, since it <b>is derived from the latter clause of the verse</b> in Deuteronomy, as the verse states: <b>“But these are they of which you shall not eat”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:12), which serves <b>to include the slaughtered</b> bird <b>of the leper.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> the verse: “Every kosher bird you may eat,” is referring <b>to the slaughtered</b> bird <b>of a leper, and</b> the verse indicates that one <b>transgresses</b> the <b>positive mitzva</b> of: “You may eat,” in addition to the <b>prohibition</b> of: “But these are they of which you shall not eat,” <b>on account of it.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> why not <b>interpret</b> the verse as referring <b>to a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> and explain that the verse teaches that one <b>transgresses a positive mitzva and a prohibition on account of it?</b> The Gemara responds: The verse should be interpreted as referring to the slaughtered bird of a leper, since it is <b>a matter derived from its context,</b> as that verse <b>is written in the context of a slaughtered</b> bird. By contrast, a <i>tereifa</i> is not properly slaughtered, and interpreting the verse in that manner does not fit the context.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is stated in the passage discussing the purification ritual of a leper: “Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed <b>two living birds [<i>tzipporim</i>]</b> that are kosher” (Leviticus 14:4). Since the birds are obviously alive before the purification ritual begins, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the word <b>“living”?</b> Is it <b>not that they are living in your mouth,</b> i.e., permitted for consumption? If so, <b>by inference,</b> one may conclude <b>that there are</b> birds [<i>tzipporim</i>] <b>that are not living in your mouth,</b> i.e., that are not kosher. The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> that is not its meaning. Rather, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the word <b>“living”?</b> It means <b>that their extremities are living,</b> i.e., attached to their bodies. The verse indicates that the kosher birds must have all their limbs attached to their bodies in order to be used in the purification ritual.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof <b>from the latter clause</b> of that verse: “Two living birds [<i>tzipporim</i>] that are <b>kosher.”</b> Since it was necessary for the verse to specify that it is referring to kosher birds, <b>by inference</b> one may conclude <b>that there are non-kosher</b> birds, in contradiction to the statement of Rabbi Yitzḥak. The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> that is not the correct inference. Rather, <b>by inference</b> one may conclude <b>that there are</b> other birds of kosher species that may not be used for this ritual, i.e., <b><i>tereifot</i>.</b>
The Gemara objects: But the disqualification of <b><i>tereifot</i> is</b> already <b>derived from</b> the word <b>“living”</b> in that verse. The Gemara elaborates: Granted, <b>this works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> can live</b> (see 42a); it is therefore necessary for the verse to state “kosher” to exclude <i>tereifot</i>, because one could not have derived it from the word “living.” <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> animal <b>cannot live, what is there to say?</b> Let it be derived from the word “living.” <b>And furthermore, whether according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> can live or according to the one who says</b> that <b>a <i>tereifa</i> cannot live,</b> it is not necessary to derive the exclusion of <i>tereifot</i> from the word “kosher,” since it <b>is derived from that which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught.</b>
<b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> It is <b>stated</b> in the Torah that there are offerings that <b>enable</b> one to partake of sacrificial foods, e.g., the sin offering of a woman who has given birth or the guilt offering of a leper, <b>and</b> there are offerings that <b>atone,</b> e.g., a sin offering or guilt offering, all of which are brought <b>inside</b> the Temple. <b>And</b> it is also <b>stated</b> in the Torah that there are offerings that <b>enable</b> one to partake of sacrificial foods, e.g., the birds of a leper’s purification ritual, <b>and</b> offerings that <b>atone,</b> e.g., the scapegoat of the Yom Kippur service, that are brought <b>outside</b> the Temple.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Therefore, the offerings brought outside the Temple are compared to those offered inside: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the offerings that <b>enable or atone stated</b> in the Torah that are offered <b>inside</b> the Temple, the Torah <b>made</b> the offering that <b>enables like</b> the offering that <b>atones,</b> as even the former has portions of it that are burned on the altar, <b>so too,</b> with regard to offerings that <b>enable or atone stated</b> in the Torah that are offered <b>outside</b> the Temple, the Torah <b>made</b> the offering that <b>enables like</b> the offering that <b>atones.</b> Accordingly, just as the scapegoat must not be a <i>tereifa</i>, so too, the birds of a leper’s purification ritual must not be <i>tereifot</i>. If so, there is no need to derive the exclusion of <i>tereifa</i> birds from the word “kosher.”
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The word “kosher” serves <b>to exclude birds from an idolatrous city.</b> Such a city must be burned to the ground, and it is prohibited for one to derive benefit from any of its contents. The verse indicates that such a bird is unfit for use in the leper’s purification ritual. The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> function are such birds rendered unfit by the word “kosher”? <b>If</b> the verse means <b>to</b> render them unfit for <b>sending</b> away as part of the ritual, this is unnecessary, since the <b>Torah did not say</b> to <b>send</b> a bird only <b>to</b> create <b>a stumbling block.</b> It is obvious that any bird prohibited for consumption is unfit for sending, since the Torah would not allow for the possibility that the bird sent away will be trapped and consumed by unwitting individuals. <b>Rather,</b> the verse means <b>to</b> render them unfit for use as the bird intended for <b>slaughter.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> The word “kosher” serves <b>to exclude</b> the repeated use of a bird, i.e., a leper may <b>not pair</b> a bird <b>with another</b> bird from a previous leper, <b>before its</b> being <b>sent</b> away. The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> function does the word “kosher” indicate that a bird may not be reused? <b>If</b> it means <b>to</b> indicate that the bird intended for being sent away by the first leper may not be used for <b>slaughter</b> by the second leper, the verse is unnecessary, as this bird <b>requires</b> being <b>sent</b> away as part of the first leper’s purification ritual. <b>Rather,</b> the verse means <b>to</b> indicate that the bird intended for being sent away by the first leper may not be used for <b>sending</b> simultaneously by the second leper.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The word “kosher” serves <b>to</b> exclude the use of <b>birds that were exchanged for birds of idol worship,</b> i.e., a gentile paid a Jew for his idol by giving the Jew birds. Such birds are prohibited from use in the leper’s ritual, <b>as it is written</b> about objects of idol worship: “And you shall not bring an abomination into your house, <b>and become [<i>vahayita</i>] accursed like it”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:26), indicating that <b>anything that you generate [<i>mehayye</i>] from it,</b> e.g., through exchange, is prohibited <b>like it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> function does the word “kosher” indicate that such birds are prohibited? <b>If</b> it serves <b>to</b> exclude such birds from being <b>sent</b> away, this is unnecessary, because <b>the Torah did not say: Send</b> it away, if doing so could lead <b>to a mishap.</b> If the bird were prohibited, the Torah would not have commanded one to send it away, as others might eat it unwittingly. <b>Rather,</b> the word “kosher” serves <b>to</b> disqualify such birds for <b>slaughter.</b>
<b>Ravina said: Here we are dealing with a bird that killed a person</b> and is therefore subject to being killed. The verse indicates that such a bird is unfit for use in the leper’s ritual. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If</b> this is a case <b>where its verdict</b> of execution <b>was issued,</b> then <b>it is subject</b> to being <b>killed,</b> and there is no need for the verse to teach that it cannot be used in the ritual. <b>Rather,</b> it must be referring to a bird <b>before its verdict</b> of execution <b>was issued. And for what</b> function does the verse exclude such a bird? <b>If</b> it serves <b>to</b> exclude the bird from <b>sending</b> away, this is unnecessary, since one is <b>required to bring it to the court to fulfill</b> the verse: <b>“And you shall eradicate the evil from your midst”</b> (Deuteronomy 13:6). Obviously, one may not send it away. <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to</b> disqualify such a bird for <b>slaughter.</b>
§ The mishna states: If <b>a non-kosher bird is resting upon the eggs of a kosher bird,</b> or a kosher bird is resting upon the eggs of a non-kosher bird, one is exempt from sending away the bird. The Gemara objects: <b>Granted,</b> it is understandable that one is exempt in a case where <b>a non-kosher bird is resting upon the eggs of a kosher</b> bird, since <b>we require</b> a kosher bird, as the verse uses the word <b>“<i>tzippor</i>”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:6) in this context, which the Gemara earlier (139b) interpreted as a reference to a kosher bird, <b>and</b> this bird <b>is not</b> kosher. <b>But</b> in a case where <b>a kosher bird is resting upon the eggs of a non-kosher bird, it is a <i>tzippor</i>,</b> a kosher bird, and one should be required to send it away.
The Gemara responds that this is in accordance with <b>that which Rav Kahana said</b> in a different context: The verse states: “But the young <b>you may take for yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7), indicating that one is required to send away the mother only if the eggs are fit for consumption, <b>but not</b> if they are fit only <b>for your dog. Here too,</b> with regard to non-kosher eggs, the mitzva applies only if <b>you may take for yourself, but not</b> if they are fit only <b>for your dog</b> because they are not kosher.
The Gemara asks: <b>And where was</b> this statement <b>of Rav Kahana stated?</b> The Gemara answers that it was stated <b>with regard to that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Even if the <b>mother</b> bird is <b>a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> away the mother from the nest. But if the <b>fledglings</b> are <b><i>tereifot</i>,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother. <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rav Kahana said: As the verse states: “You may take for yourself,”</b> indicating that you are required to send away the mother only if the fledglings are fit for consumption, <b>but not</b> if they are fit only <b>for your dog</b> because they are <i>tereifot</i>.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> why not <b>compare a <i>tereifa</i> mother</b> bird <b>to</b> <i>tereifa</i> <b>fledglings</b> and say: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b><i>tereifa</i> fledglings</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother, <b>so too,</b> with regard to <b>a <i>tereifa</i> mother</b> one should <b>also</b> be <b>exempt from sending</b> her away.

Daf 140b

The Gemara responds: <b>If so,</b> that the mother should be compared to the fledglings, then <b>why do I</b> need the word <b>“<i>tzippor</i>” to exclude a non-kosher bird?</b> One could simply derive it from the fact that one is exempt from the mitzva in the case of non-kosher fledglings, since they are not fit for consumption. Rather, since it was necessary for the verse to teach that non-kosher birds are not included in the mitzva of sending away the mother, it must be that no such comparison is to be drawn.
The Gemara questions the statement of Rav Kahana that the mitzva of sending away the mother bird from the nest does not apply in the case of fledglings unfit for consumption: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a mother of fledglings,</b> in the case of a <b><i>tereifa</i>,</b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> away the mother bird from the nest? The <i>baraita</i> appears to teach that even if the fledglings themselves are <i>tereifot</i>, one is obligated in the mitzva. <b>Abaye said</b> in response: The word <i>tereifa</i> is not referring to the fledglings. Rather, <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> In the case of <b>a fledgling whose mother is a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> away the mother bird. This <i>baraita</i>, then, is in accordance with the statement of Rav Kahana.
§ With regard to the statement of Rav Kahana above, <b>Rav Hoshaya raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>stretched his hand into a nest</b> containing a mother bird and its fledglings <b>and slaughtered,</b> i.e., severed, <b>a minority of</b> the <b>two organs that must be severed in ritual slaughter [<i>simanim</i>],</b> i.e., the windpipe and the gullet, of the fledglings,<b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to sending away the mother bird?
The two sides of the dilemma are explained: <b>Do we say: Since if those</b> fledglings <b>are left</b> as they are, with only partially severed <i>simanim</i>, <b>they will</b> eventually be rendered <b><i>tereifot</i>,</b> one is therefore exempt from sending away the mother because <b>we require</b> that the fledglings be taken <b>“for yourself,” and not for your dog? Or perhaps, since it is in his power to complete the</b> act of <b>slaughter,</b> thereby permitting the fledglings for consumption, <b>we</b> may <b>call</b> this case: <b>“Take for yourself,” and one is obligated to send</b> away the mother bird. Since no answer is given, the Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> In a case where <b>a rag</b> is lying in the nest between the mother bird and the eggs, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does <b>it interpose</b>between them,such that the mother is not considered to be resting upon the eggs? If so, one would be exempt from sending away the mother. Similarly, if feathers are detached from a bird’s <b>wings</b> and are lying between the mother bird and the eggs, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do <b>they interpose</b> between the eggs and the mother?
Rabbi Yirmeya continues: If <b>unfertilized [<i>muzarot</i>] eggs</b> separate between the mother bird and fertilized eggs, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Additionally, in a case where <b>two sets of</b> fertilized <b>eggs</b> are lying <b>one on top of the other, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the upper set of eggs interpose between the mother and the lower set? Furthermore, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in a case where <b>a male</b> bird is resting <b>on top of</b> the <b>eggs and a female</b> bird is resting <b>on top of</b> the <b>male?</b> Does the male bird interpose between the female and the eggs? No answers are given, so the Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved in all of these cases.
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>a pigeon</b> is resting <b>upon the eggs of a <i>tasil</i>,</b> a kosher bird resembling a pigeon, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to sending away the mother bird from the nest? Likewise, if <b>a <i>tasil</i></b> is resting <b>upon the eggs of a pigeon, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
<b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which is taught in the mishna: In a case where <b>a non-kosher bird is resting upon the eggs of a kosher bird, or a kosher</b> bird <b>is resting upon the eggs of a non-kosher bird,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the bird. One may infer from the mishna <b>that</b> in a case involving <b>a kosher</b> bird <b>and kosher</b> eggs, e.g., a <i>tasil</i> resting on the eggs of a pigeon, one is <b>obligated</b> to send away the mother bird. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps</b> this inference applies only <b>to</b> the case of a female <b>pheasant,</b> which normally rests upon the eggs of other birds. Since this is its normal behavior, one is obligated to send it away even if it rests upon the eggs of another kosher bird. This may not be the case with regard to a <i>tasil</i> or pigeon.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to the case of <b>a male pheasant</b> that rests upon the eggs of its species, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> one <b>obligated</b> to send away the pheasant, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> one <b>exempt</b> from sending it away. With regard to this dispute, <b>Rabbi Abbahu said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> According to Rabbi Eliezer, a verbal analogy between <b>brooding</b> stated with regard to a male pheasant and <b>brooding</b> with regard to a female bird <b>comes</b> to indicate that the resting of a male pheasant upon its eggs is considered an effective resting. <b>It is written here: “As the pheasant that broods over young that he has not brought forth”</b> (Jeremiah 17:11), <b>and it is written elsewhere</b> about a female bird: “There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, <b>and hatch, and brood under her shadow”</b> (Isaiah 34:15). Just as a female bird broods over its nest, so too, a male pheasant broods over a nest. Therefore, one is required to send away the male bird from the nest as well.
With regard to this dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis, <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> Their <b>dispute</b> is only <b>with regard to a male pheasant, but</b> with regard <b>to a female pheasant all agree</b> that one is <b>obligated</b> to send away the bird. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious,</b> given that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>A male pheasant?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>the Rabbis deem</b> one <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva of sending away the mother bird <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a female pheasant, and</b> as for <b>that which</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the dispute in the case of <b>a male</b> pheasant, the reason is <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> in that he requires one to send away even a male pheasant, therefore, Rabbi Elazar <b>teaches us</b> that the Rabbis agree that one must send away a female pheasant.
<b>And Rabbi Elazar</b> also <b>says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis is only <b>with regard to a male pheasant, but</b> with regard <b>to male</b> birds <b>in general, all agree</b> that one is <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva of sending away the bird from the nest. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious,</b> given that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>A male pheasant?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> one <b>obligated</b> to send away <b>even male</b> birds <b>in general, and that which</b> the mishna <b>teaches: A male</b> pheasant, is <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> in that they also deem one exempt from sending a male pheasant, therefore, Rabbi Elazar <b>teaches us</b> that even according to Rabbi Eliezer, one is exempt from sending away male birds in general.
The Gemara notes: <b>This</b> explanation of Rabbi Elazar <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a male</b> bird <b>in general,</b> one is <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva of sending it away, but with regard to <b>a male pheasant, Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> one <b>obligated</b> to send it away from the nest, <b>and the Rabbis deem</b> one <b>exempt</b> from sending it away.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the mother bird <b>was hovering</b> over the eggs or fledglings in the nest, <b>when its wings are touching</b> the eggs or fledglings <b>in the nest,</b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> away the mother. When its wings <b>are not touching</b> the eggs or fledglings <b>in the nest,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother. Even if <b>there is only one fledgling or one egg,</b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> away the mother, <b>as it is stated:</b> “If a bird’s <b>nest</b> happens before you” (Deuteronomy 22:6), indicating that one is obligated to send away the mother bird from the <b>nest in any case.</b>
If <b>there were fledglings</b> capable of <b>flying, or unfertilized eggs</b> from which a fledgling will not hatch, one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother bird from the nest, <b>as it is stated</b> in the same verse: <b>“And the mother is resting upon the fledglings or upon the eggs.”</b> From the juxtaposition of the fledglings and the eggs one derives: <b>Just as the fledglings are living, so too, the eggs</b> must <b>be</b> capable of producing <b>living</b> fledglings. This <b>excludes unfertilized</b> eggs, which cannot produce a living fledgling. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>just as the eggs need their mothers</b> to hatch them, <b>so too, the fledglings</b> must be those that <b>need their mothers.</b> This <b>excludes</b> fledglings that are capable of <b>flying.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna discusses the case of a mother bird that hovers over the nest. With regard to this, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse teaches that one is obligated to send away the mother bird only when it is at rest, as it states: “And the mother is <b>resting</b> upon the fledglings” (Deuteronomy 22:6), <b>and not</b> when it is <b>hovering.</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that one is exempt <b>even</b> if the mother is hovering and <b>its wings are touching the nest.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Resting,”</b> indicating that in fact one is obligated in the mitzva in such a case. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation,</b> i.e., how is this derived from the word “resting”? The Gemara responds: It is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the word <b>sitting is not written</b> in the verse. Although a bird whose wings are touching the nest is not sitting upon it, such a bird is considered to be resting upon it.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If the mother bird <b>was sitting</b> above the eggs or fledglings <b>between two tree branches,</b> one <b>looks</b> at the following factor in order to determine whether the obligation to send away the mother applies: In <b>any</b> case <b>where if</b> the branches were to separate, the bird <b>would slip</b> between them and <b>fall upon</b> the eggs or fledglings, one is <b>obligated to send</b> away the mother bird. <b>And if</b> the bird would <b>not</b> fall upon them, but to the sides, one is <b>exempt</b> from the mitzva of sending away the mother bird.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rav from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If the mother bird <b>was sitting among</b> the eggs or the fledglings, one is <b>exempt from sending</b> it away, as the verse states: “And the mother is resting upon the fledglings, or upon the eggs” (Deuteronomy 22:6), i.e., upon and not among. If it was sitting <b>above them,</b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> it away. If it <b>was hovering, even</b> if <b>its wings are touching the nest,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> it away.
<b>What, is it not</b> that the case of sitting <b>above them</b> is <b>similar to</b> the case of sitting <b>between them?</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>Just as</b> in the case of sitting <b>between them</b> one is exempt <b>where she is touching them, so too,</b> in the case of sitting <b>above them</b> one is obligated <b>where she is touching them.</b> If so, conclude from this <i>baraita</i> that one is obligated only if the bird is touching the fledglings or eggs, <b>but</b> if it is sitting between two <b>tree branches</b> above the eggs or fledglings without touching them, one is <b>exempt</b> from sending her away.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No;</b> actually, the case of sitting <b>above them</b> is <b>similar to</b> that of sitting <b>between them</b> in the following manner: <b>Just as</b> the case of sitting <b>between them</b> is one <b>where she is not touching them</b> from <b>above,</b> but from the side, <b>so too,</b> the case of sitting <b>above them</b> is one <b>where she is not touching them</b> from <b>above.</b> Accordingly, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that one is obligated to send away the bird if it is resting on branches above the nest, even though it is not touching the eggs or fledglings. <b>And that is</b> the case where the mother is sitting between two <b>tree branches.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>This, too, stands to reason,</b> that one is obligated to send away a mother bird that is sitting between two tree branches above the nest. <b>As, if</b> it should <b>enter your mind</b> that one is <b>exempt</b> when the mother bird is sitting between two <b>tree branches,</b> then one may ask: <b>Rather than teaching</b> that if it <b>was hovering, even</b> if <b>its wings are touching the nest,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> it away, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> that one is exempt in the case of a mother bird that is sitting between two <b>tree branches, and all the more so</b> if the mother <b>is hovering.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: Perhaps one is exempt from sending the mother bird if it is resting between two tree branches. Nevertheless, it <b>was necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> to teach the case of <b>a hovering</b> bird, in order to teach <b>that even</b> if <b>its wings are touching the nest,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother bird. Had the <i>tanna</i> taught the exemption in a case of a bird resting between two tree branches, one might have thought that this is because the bird’s wings are not touching the nest.
The Gemara now questions the <i>baraita</i> itself: How can the <i>baraita</i> state that even if the hovering bird’s wings are touching the nest, one is exempt from sending the bird away? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>When its wings are touching the nest,</b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> away the mother? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: When</b> the case of the hovering mother bird <b>is taught</b> in <b>the <i>baraita</i>,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a bird <b>touching</b> the nest <b>from the side.</b> In such a case, one is exempt because its wings are not touching the nest from above. By contrast, the mishna is referring to a case where the bird is hovering directly above the nest and touching the nest with its wings from above.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the discussion proceeded as follows: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of Rav: If the mother bird <b>was sitting among</b> the eggs or the fledglings, one is <b>exempt from sending</b> it away. If it was sitting <b>above them,</b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> it away. If <b>it was hovering, even</b> if <b>its wings are touching the nest,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> it away.
<b>What, is it not</b> that the case of sitting <b>above them</b> is <b>similar to</b> that of sitting <b>between them</b> in the following manner: <b>Just as</b> the case of sitting <b>between them</b> is one <b>where she is not touching them</b> from <b>above</b> but from the side, <b>so too,</b> the case of sitting <b>above them</b> is one <b>where she is not touching them</b> from <b>above?</b> If so, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that if the bird rests on branches over the eggs or fledglings without touching them, one is obligated in the mitzva. <b>And that is</b> the case where the mother is sitting between two <b>tree branches.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> the case of sitting <b>above them</b> is <b>similar to</b> that of sitting <b>between them</b> in the following manner: <b>Just as</b> the case of sitting <b>between them</b> is one <b>where she is touching them, so too,</b> the case of sitting <b>above them</b> is one <b>where she is touching them.</b> Accordingly, one is obligated only if the bird is touching the nest from above; <b>but</b> if it is sitting between two <b>tree branches</b> without touching the eggs or the fledglings, one is <b>exempt</b> from sending it away. The Gemara objects: <b>If that is so, rather than teaching</b> in <b>the last clause:</b> If it <b>was hovering, even</b> if <b>its wings are touching the nest,</b> one is <b>exempt</b> from sending it away,

Daf 141a

<b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> that one is exempt in a case where the bird is sitting between two <b>tree branches,</b> which resembles a case where the bird is resting upon the nest itself in that the bird is sitting in both cases, <b>and</b> it would be clear <b>all the more so</b> that one is exempt if the mother <b>is hovering.</b> The Gemara responds: It <b>was necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to teach the case of <b>a hovering</b> bird in order to teach <b>that even</b> if <b>its wings are touching the nest,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother bird. Had the <i>baraita</i> taught the exemption in a case of a bird resting between two tree branches, one might have thought that this is because the bird’s wings are not touching the nest.
The Gemara now questions the <i>baraita</i> itself: How can the <i>baraita</i> state that even if the hovering bird’s wings are touching the nest, one is exempt from sending the bird? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>When its wings are touching the nest,</b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> away the mother? <b>Rav Yehuda said: When</b> the case of the hovering mother bird <b>is taught</b> in <b>the <i>baraita</i>,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a bird <b>touching</b> the nest <b>from the side.</b> In such a case, one is exempt because its wings are not touching the nest from above. By contrast, the mishna is referring to a case where the bird is hovering directly above the nest and touching the nest with its wings from above.
§ The mishna teaches: Even if <b>there is</b> only one <b>fledgling</b> or one egg, one is obligated to send away the mother, as it is stated: “If a bird’s nest happens before you” (Deuteronomy 22:6), indicating that one is obligated to send the mother bird away from the nest in any case. Additionally, if there were fledglings capable of flying or unfertilized eggs, one is exempt from sending away the mother bird, as it is stated in the same verse: “And the mother is resting upon the fledglings or upon the eggs.” From the juxtaposition of the fledglings and the eggs, one derives that the eggs or fledglings must be capable of living and they must require their mothers. With regard to this, <b>one of the Sages said to Rava: Say the opposite,</b> that if <b>there is only one fledgling or one egg,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother, <b>since we require</b> that the mother be “resting upon the <b>fledglings or</b> upon the <b>eggs,” and</b> this condition is <b>not</b> fulfilled with fewer than two.
Additionally, if <b>there were fledglings</b> capable of <b>flying or unfertilized eggs</b> in the nest, say that one is <b>obligated to send</b> the mother bird away, <b>as it is stated</b> in that verse: <b>“Nest,”</b> indicating that one is obligated to send the mother bird away from the <b>nest in any case.</b> Rava responds: <b>If so, let the verse write: And the mother is resting upon them.</b> For <b>what</b> reason does the verse state: <b>“And the mother is resting upon the fledglings or upon the eggs”?</b> It is <b>to compare the fledglings to the eggs and the eggs to the fledglings,</b> i.e., to indicate that the eggs or fledglings must be capable of living and must require their mothers. Fledglings that can fly and unfertilized eggs are therefore not included in the mitzva. Consequently, the word “nest” serves to indicate that one is obligated to send away the mother bird even if there is only one egg or fledgling in the nest.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>one sent</b> away the mother bird <b>and it returned</b> to rest on the eggs, <b>even</b> if it returned <b>four or five times,</b> one is <b>obligated</b> to send it away again, <b>as it is stated: “You shall send [<i>shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ</i>] the mother”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7). The doubled verb indicates that one must send away the mother bird multiple times if needed. If one <b>said: I am hereby taking the mother and sending</b> away <b>the offspring,</b> he is still <b>obligated</b> to send away the mother even if he sent away the offspring, <b>as it is stated: “You shall send the mother.”</b> If one sent away the mother and <b>took the offspring and</b> then <b>returned them</b> to the mother’s nest, <b>and thereafter the mother returned</b> and rested <b>upon them,</b> one is <b>exempt from sending</b> away the mother bird.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if the mother bird returned to rest on the eggs, even if it returned four or five times, one is obligated to send it away again, as it is stated: “You shall send [<i>shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ</i>].” With regard to this, <b>one of the Sages said to Rava: But say</b> instead that the word <b>“<i>shalle’aḥ</i>”</b> indicates that one must send away the mother <b>once,</b> and the word <b>“<i>teshallaḥ</i>”</b> indicates that one must do so <b>twice,</b> and beyond that there is no obligation.
Rava <b>said to him:</b> Actually, the <i>halakha</i> that one must send away the mother multiple times is not derived from the phrase “<i>shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ</i>.” Rather, the word <b>“<i>shalle’aḥ</i>”</b> indicates that one must send away the mother bird <b>even one hundred times,</b> and the word <b>“<i>teshallaḥ</i>”</b> teaches another matter: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the obligation to send away the mother bird in a case where one takes the eggs or the fledglings and wants to take the mother bird <b>for a discretionary purpose,</b> e.g., to eat it. In a case where one takes the eggs or the fledglings and needs the mother bird <b>for a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva,</b> e.g., the purification of a leper, <b>from where</b> is the <i>halakha</i> that he must send away the mother derived? <b>The verse states: “<i>Teshallaḥ</i>,”</b> to teach that <b>in any case</b> one must send away the mother bird.
<b>Rabbi Abba, son of Rav Yosef bar Rava, said to Rav Kahana: But</b> according to this explanation, the only <b>reason</b> that one must send away the mother bird even when needed for a matter involving a mitzva is <b>that the Merciful One wrote: “<i>Teshallaḥ</i>”; but</b> if <b>not</b> for <b>this, I would say</b> that when the mother is needed <b>for a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva,</b> one is <b>not</b> obligated to send her away. But this is difficult, as the sending of the mother bird <b>is</b> both <b>a positive mitzva and a prohibition,</b> as the verse states: “You shall not take the mother with the young; you shall send the mother” (Deuteronomy 22:6–7), <b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>a positive mitzva cannot override</b> both <b>a prohibition and a positive mitzva.</b>
Rav Kahana replied: <b>No,</b> the word “<i>teshallaḥ</i>” is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>where one transgressed and took the mother</b> with the fledglings. In such a case, <b>he has</b> already <b>transgressed the prohibition,</b> and <b>there is</b> now only <b>a positive mitzva</b> to send away the mother. Perhaps one might say: <b>Let the positive mitzva</b> performed with the mother, e.g., the purification of the leper, <b>come and override the positive mitzva</b> of sending away the mother. Therefore, the word “<i>teshallaḥ</i>” <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so, and one is obligated to send away the mother.
The Gemara notes: <b>This works out well according to the one who teaches</b> that the criterion for determining whether one is flogged for violating a prohibition that entails fulfillment of a positive mitzva is whether he <b>fulfilled</b> the mitzva immediately afterward <b>or did not fulfill it.</b> If he does not fulfill the mitzva immediately, he is flogged when he fails to do so. Consequently, if one does not send away the mother bird immediately after taking her with the fledglings, he has immediately violated the prohibition, and only the requirement to fulfill the positive mitzva remains.
The Gemara continues: <b>But according to the one who teaches</b> that the criterion for determining whether one is flogged in that case is whether he <b>negated</b> the possibility of fulfilling the positive mitzva <b>or did not negate it,</b> and one is flogged only if he performed an action that renders it impossible to fulfill the mitzva, this explanation does not work out well. After all, <b>as long as one has not slaughtered</b> the mother bird, he <b>has not transgressed the prohibition,</b> since he may still send her away. Consequently, even if one takes the mother, as long as he has not slaughtered her, the prohibition remains in addition to the positive mitzva. If so, there is no need for the Torah to teach that the obligation to send away the mother bird applies in the case of a mitzva.
<b>And furthermore,</b> one may ask: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who said</b> that the word <b>“<i>shalle’aḥ</i>” indicates</b> that the mitzva to send away the mother bird applies only <b>at the outset,</b> i.e., before taking the fledglings, one who takes the mother together with the fledglings violates both the prohibition and the positive mitzva associated with it, such that <b>even a positive mitzva does not</b> remain.
<b>Rather, Mar bar Rav Ashi said:</b> The word “<i>teshallaḥ</i>” is necessary to indicate that the mitzva to send away the mother bird applies in a case <b>where one took her in order to send</b> her away immediately. In such a case, <b>there is no prohibition,</b> as one intends to send her away, but <b>there is</b> still <b>a positive</b> mitzva to send her away. <b>And</b> therefore, one might have said: <b>Let</b> another <b>positive mitzva,</b> e.g., taking the mother for the purification of a leper, <b>come and override the positive mitzva</b> of sending the mother. Therefore, the word “<i>teshallaḥ</i>” indicates that the mitzva of sending the mother bird applies even in such a case.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the strength of that</b> other <b>positive mitzva over this positive mitzva</b> of sending away the mother bird? Why might the former override the latter? The Gemara responds: It might <b>enter your mind</b> to say that <b>since the Master said: Great</b> is <b>peace between a man and his wife, as the Torah said</b> that <b>the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, which is written in sanctity, shall be erased on the waters</b> as part of the ritual of a woman suspected by her husband of adultery (see Numbers 5:23) in order to clear her from suspicion and restore peace between her and her husband, therefore, perhaps the <i>halakha</i> should be more lenient with regard to the leper.
The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this leper, since as long as he is not purified he is prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>marital relations, as it is written: “But he shall dwell outside his tent seven days”</b> (Leviticus 14:8), and when the verse states: <b>“His tent,” this</b> is referring to <b>his wife,</b> such that one may derive <b>from here that</b> a leper <b>is prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>marital relations,</b> perhaps his purification ceremony should take precedence. This is because <b>perhaps you</b> will <b>say: Since he is prohibited from</b> engaging in <b>marital relations, let his positive mitzva</b> of purification <b>come and override the positive mitzva of the sending</b> away <b>of</b> the mother bird from <b>the nest.</b> Therefore, the word “<i>teshallaḥ</i>” <b>teaches us</b> that even so, one may not take the mother bird.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who takes the mother</b> bird <b>with</b> its <b>fledglings, Rabbi Yehuda says: He is flogged</b> for taking the mother bird, <b>and</b> he <b>does not send</b> away the mother. <b>And the Rabbis say: He sends</b> away the mother <b>and is not flogged,</b> as <b>this is the principle:</b> With regard to <b>any prohibition that entails</b> a command to <b>arise</b> and <b>perform</b> a mitzva, <b>one is not flogged for its</b> violation.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that according to Rabbi Yehuda, one who takes the mother with the offspring is flogged. With regard to this, <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel raises a dilemma:</b> Is <b>the reasoning</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yehuda that he holds</b> that <b>one is flogged for</b> violation of <b>a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva?</b> Accordingly, one is flogged for transgressing the prohibition: “You shall not take the mother with the young,” which entails the fulfillment of: “You shall send the mother.”
The second possibility is now presented: <b>Or perhaps in general</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> that <b>one is not flogged for</b> violation of <b>a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva; and here, this is the reason</b> one is flogged for taking the mother: It is <b>because he holds</b> that when the verse states: “You shall send the mother [<i>shalle’aḥ teshallaḥ</i>]” (Deuteronomy 22:7), the word <b>“<i>shalle’aḥ</i>” indicates</b> that the mitzva to sending the mother bird applies only <b>at the outset,</b> i.e., when encountering the nest. Accordingly, this is not a case of a prohibition that entails the performance of a positive mitzva, but an independent prohibition, for which one is liable to receive lashes.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from that which is taught: <b>A thief and a robber are included among</b> those who are liable to receive <b>lashes</b> by Torah law. A thief violates the prohibition of: “You shall not steal” (Leviticus 19:11), and a robber violates the prohibition of: “You shall not rob” (Leviticus 19:13); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b> The Gemara continues: <b>But here,</b> the prohibition against robbing <b>is a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva, as the Merciful One states: “You shall not rob”</b> (Leviticus 19:13), and: <b>“And he shall restore the robbed item”</b> (Leviticus 5:23). And nevertheless, Rabbi Yehuda deems one liable to receive lashes for transgressing the prohibition against robbing. Therefore, <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>the reasoning</b> of the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the mishna is <b>that he holds</b> that <b>one is flogged for</b> violation of <b>a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to him: Didn’t I</b> already <b>tell you</b> that <b>any <i>baraita</i> that is not taught</b> in the study <b>hall</b>

Daf 141b

of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya or</b> the study <b>hall</b> of <b>Rabbi Oshaya,</b> who were precise in the formulation of their <i>baraitot</i>, <b>is corrupted, and you may not raise objections</b> based <b>upon it</b> in <b>the study hall?</b> Since this <i>baraita</i> was not taught in either of the aforementioned study halls, you may not cite it as proof. After all, <b>perhaps</b> the phrase: <b>Are not included among</b> those who are liable to receive <b>forty lashes</b> by Torah law, <b>was taught</b> by Rabbi Yehuda in the <i>baraita</i>, but the text was corrupted. It is therefore possible that according to Rabbi Yehuda, one is not flogged for violation of a prohibition that entails fulfillment of a positive mitzva, and his reasoning of his ruling in the mishna is that the word “<i>shalle’aḥ</i>” indicates that the mitzva to send away the mother bird applies only at the outset.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that <b>which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> by <b>Rabbi Oshaya and Rabbi Ḥiyya:</b> It is written with regard to forgotten sheaves left for the poor: “When you reap your harvest in your field and forget a sheaf in the field, <b>you shall not return</b> to fetch it” (Deuteronomy 24:19). If one transgressed this prohibition <b>and</b> one <b>returned</b> to fetch it, he is liable to receive lashes. Likewise, it is written with regard to produce in the corner of the field [<i>pe’a</i>], which is given to the poor: “And when you reap the harvest of your land, <b>you shall not wholly reap</b> the corner of your field” (Leviticus 19:9). If one transgressed this prohibition <b>and reaped</b> the corner of his field, such individuals <b>are included among</b> those who are liable to receive <b>lashes</b> by Torah law. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara concludes the resolution: Since the mitzvot of leaving <i>pe’a</i> and forgotten sheaves are prohibitions that entail fulfillment of a positive mitzva, as the verse states with regard to both of them: “For the poor and for the stranger you shall leave them” (Leviticus 19:10), <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>the reasoning</b> of the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the mishna is <b>that he holds</b> that <b>one is flogged for</b> violation of <b>a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps there,</b> with regard to <i>pe’a</i> and forgotten sheaves, <b>this is</b> the <b>reason</b> that Rabbi Yehuda deems one liable to receive lashes: <b>Because he holds</b> that the positive mitzva: “For the poor and for the stranger <b>you shall leave</b> them,” <b>indicates</b> that these mitzvot apply only <b>at the outset.</b> Accordingly, these are not cases of prohibitions that entail fulfillment of a positive mitzva, but of independent prohibitions. Similarly, it is possible that the reasoning of the ruling of Rabbi Yehuda in the mishna is that the mitzva of the sending away of the mother bird applies only at the outset.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the Paschal offering: <b>“You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning;</b> but that which remains of it until the morning <b>you shall burn in fire”</b> (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to position the positive mitzva</b> of burning the leftover meat <b>after</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against leaving over the meat, in order <b>to say that one is not flogged for its</b> violation; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
Ravina continued: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that according to Rabbi Yehuda, one is not flogged for violation of a prohibition that entails fulfillment of a positive mitzva, and that <b>the reasoning</b> of the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the mishna is <b>that he holds</b> that the word <b>“<i>shalle’aḥ</i>” indicates</b> that the mitzva to send away the mother applies only <b>at the outset.</b> Consequently, the prohibition against taking the mother with the offspring is not one that entails fulfillment of a positive mitzva, but an independent prohibition that is punishable by lashes. The Gemara concedes: <b>Conclude from</b> it that this is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda.
<b>Rav Idi said to Rav Ashi:</b> The language of <b>the mishna is also precise, as it teaches:</b> With regard to <b>one who takes the mother with the offspring, Rabbi Yehuda says: He is flogged and there is no</b> longer a mitzva to <b>send</b> away the mother. <b>But if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> to say that <b>the reasoning</b> of the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> in the mishna is that <b>one is flogged for</b> violation of <b>a prohibition that entails</b> fulfillment <b>of a positive mitzva,</b> then Rabbi Yehuda <b>should have</b> said: <b>He is flogged and sends</b> away the mother. Rather, conclude that according to Rabbi Yehuda, this is not a prohibition that entails fulfillment of a positive mitzva.
The Gemara rejects this: One cannot infer anything from the language of the mishna, since <b>perhaps this</b> is what Rabbi Yehuda <b>is saying in the mishna:</b> There is still a mitzva to send away the mother, but <b>one is not absolved</b> of guilt for transgressing the prohibition against taking the mother <b>until</b> the court <b>flogs him.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that according to the Rabbis, if one transgressed the mitzva and took the mother bird with the young, one must send away the mother. The Gemara asks: <b>How far</b> from the nest must he <b>send her? Rav Yehuda says:</b> Far <b>enough that she leaves his grasp</b> and can no longer be caught immediately. The Gemara asks: <b>In what</b> manner <b>does</b> he <b>send her</b> away?<b>Rav Huna says:</b> He holds the mother <b>by her feet</b> and sends her away. <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> He holds her <b>by her wings [<i>baagappeha</i>]</b> and sends her away. The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav Huna says</b> that one holds the mother <b>by her feet, as it is written: “That send forth freely the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20), indicating that the sending of an animal is associated with its feet. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that one holds her <b>by her wings, because</b> the feet of the mother bird <b>are her wings,</b> as it is by means of her wings that she moves about.
§ The Gemara relates: <b>A certain</b> person <b>clipped</b> a mother bird’s <b>wing and sent it</b> away <b>and thereafter caught it. Rav Yehuda flogged him</b> for transgressing the prohibition: “You shall not take the mother with the young” (Deuteronomy 22:6). Rav Yehuda also <b>said to him: Go</b> and let <b>its wings grow</b> back <b>and</b> then <b>send it</b> away.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion did Rav Yehuda act in this case? <b>If</b> he acted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> then there was no need to send away the mother, because according to Rabbi Yehuda, <b>he is flogged</b> for taking the mother bird, <b>and</b> he <b>does not send</b> away the mother. <b>If</b> he acted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> then he should not have flogged this individual, since according to the Rabbis, <b>he sends</b> away the mother <b>and is not flogged.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> he acted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and</b> the lashes administered by Rav Yehuda were not for transgressing a Torah prohibition; rather, they were <b>rabbinic lashes for rebelliousness [<i>makkat mardut</i>],</b> as this individual acted inappropriately.
The Gemara relates that <b>a certain</b> man <b>came before Rava</b> and <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a certain kosher bird known as the <b><i>teima</i>?</b> Is it included in the mitzva of sending away the mother bird from the nest? Rava <b>said: Doesn’t this man know that</b> with regard to any <b>kosher bird one is obligated to send</b> away the mother? The man responded: Nevertheless, I am uncertain with regard to the <i>halakha</i>. Rava <b>said to him: Perhaps</b> you are uncertain about a case where <b>a single egg is placed</b> in the nest, since the Torah states: “Upon the fledglings or upon the eggs” (Deuteronomy 22:6). The man replied in the affirmative. Rava <b>said to him: That</b> too should be <b>known to you,</b> as <b>it is</b> stated in <b>the mishna</b> (140b): Even if <b>there is only one fledgling or one egg,</b> one is <b>obligated to send</b> away the mother.
The man <b>sent</b> away the bird, <b>and Rava</b> then <b>surrounded her with nets [<i>perastekei</i>] and caught her.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But shouldn’t</b> Rava <b>be concerned about</b> arousing <b>suspicion</b> that he required the sending away of the bird only so that he might catch it for himself? The Gemara responds: The nets were positioned far from the nest <b>in an unusual manner</b> that did not arouse suspicion.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Pigeons of a dovecote and pigeons of an attic are subject to the obligation of sending</b> away the motherbird,because they are ownerless and therefore not considered readily available. <b>But</b> nevertheless, <b>they are subject to the prohibition of robbery due</b> to a rabbinic ordinance to maintain <b>the ways of peace.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>But if it is so that this</b> ruling is correct <b>that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says,</b> i.e., that <b>a person’s courtyard effects acquisition for him</b> of an item placed in it even <b>without his knowledge,</b> then a dovecote or attic will effect acquisition for its owner of any eggs inside them. Accordingly, one should <b>apply here</b> the principle that the mitzva to send away the mother bird from the nest applies only in the case described in the verse: <b>“If</b> a bird’s nest <b>happens</b> before you” (Deuteronomy 22:6), which <b>excludes</b> from the mitzva a bird or egg readily <b>available</b> in one’s home. Yet the <i>baraita</i> rules that the mitzva does apply in this case.
<b>Rav says:</b> It is <b>from</b> the time of the <b>emergence of the majority of an egg</b> from a mother bird’s body <b>that</b> one <b>becomes obligated to send</b> away the mother from the nest. On the other hand, the owner of a courtyard <b>does not acquire</b> the egg <b>until it</b> fully emerges and <b>falls into his courtyard. And</b> therefore, <b>when</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that in the case of the pigeons in a dovecote or an attic, they are <b>subject to the obligation of sending</b> away the mother bird, it is referring to a time <b>before</b> the egg <b>falls into his courtyard.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the egg has not fully emerged, <b>why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> rule that the eggs <b>are forbidden</b> by rabbinic law for others to take <b>due to</b> the prohibition of <b>robbery?</b> The eggs have not yet been acquired by the owner of the courtyard. The Gemara answers: That ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to their mother,</b> i.e., the mother bird. <b>Or, if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> that ruling is referring <b>to the egg. And</b> the reason the Sages rendered it prohibited to take the eggs due to the prohibition of robbery is that <b>once the majority of an egg emerges</b> from the body of the mother bird, the owner’s <b>mind is upon</b> the eggs to acquire them, although technically he will not acquire them until they fully emerge.
The Gemara adds: <b>And now that Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: It is prohibited to acquire eggs whose mother is resting upon them, as it is stated:</b> “You shall <b>send the mother,” and</b> only <b>then: “The young you may take for yourself”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7), <b>you</b> may <b>even say: Even though</b> the eggs fully emerged and <b>fell into his courtyard,</b> he must still send away the mother bird. This is because in <b>any case in which</b> a courtyard owner <b>is capable of acquiring</b> an item by himself, <b>his courtyard can also effect acquisition</b> of it for him. <b>But</b> in <b>any case</b> in which <b>he is incapable of acquiring</b> an item by himself, <b>his courtyard cannot effect acquisition</b> of it <b>for him either.</b> Since one is incapable of acquiring the eggs so long as the mother bird is resting upon them, one’s property does not acquire the eggs for him even if they have already fallen into it.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the courtyard cannot effect acquisition of the eggs for him, <b>why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> rule: <b>They are subject to the prohibition</b> only <b>due to</b> the rabbinic ordinance to maintain <b>the ways of peace? If</b> one <b>sent</b> away the mother bird before taking the eggs, then <b>it is full-fledged robbery</b> by Torah law, since the courtyard has effected acquisition of the eggs on behalf of its owner, and <b>if</b> one <b>did not send</b> away the mother bird, <b>he needs to send</b> her away before it is permitted to take the eggs. Either way, one will have transgressed Torah law and not a rabbinic prohibition.
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case where <b>a minor</b> took the eggs without sending away the mother. A minor is not obligated in the mitzva of sending away the mother bird. The Gemara asks: <b>Is a minor subject to</b> a rabbinic ordinance concerning robbery enacted to maintain <b>the ways of peace?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> is what the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: The father of a minor</b> who took such eggs <b>is obligated to return</b> them <b>to</b> the owner of the dovecote or attic, <b>due to</b> the rabbinic prohibition concerning robbery instituted to maintain <b>the ways of peace.</b>
§ The Gemara relates an additional incident with regard to pigeons of a dovecote that were discussed above: <b>Levi bar Simon transferred ownership of the produce of his dovecote,</b> i.e., the fledglings and the eggs contained in it, <b>to Rav Yehuda.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>came before Shmuel</b> and told him of his acquisition. Shmuel <b>said to him: Go, bang on the nest,</b> i.e., the dovecote, so <b>that</b> the fledglings <b>will rise up and you will acquire them.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> purpose did Shmuel tell Rav Yehuda to do this? <b>If</b> he meant for Rav Yehuda <b>to</b> finalize the <b>acquisition</b> so that Levi bar Simon could not retract, <b>let</b> him do so <b>through</b> acquisition by means of <b>a cloth.</b> There is no need for him to bang on the dovecote. <b>If</b> this incident occurred on the eve of a Festival, and Rav Yehuda came to ask what action to take in order to render the birds permitted for slaughter on the <b>Festival,</b> then banging on the dovecote should not be necessary,

Daf 142a

because <b>by standing</b> on the eve of the Festival <b>and saying: This</b> bird <b>and that</b> bird <b>I will take</b> on the Festival, he would have effected <b>sufficient</b> preparation for their use on the Festival. The Gemara responds: <b>These,</b> the offspring and the eggs, <b>were new produce, which Levi bar Simon himself had not</b> yet <b>acquired. And this</b> is what Shmuel was <b>saying to him: Go and bang on the nest</b> so <b>that</b> the mothers <b>will rise up, and Levi bar Simon will</b> have then <b>acquired</b> the young in the nest,<b>and</b> consequently, <b>he</b> may <b>then transfer ownership to you through</b> acquisition by means of <b>a cloth.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person may not take the mother</b> bird <b>with the offspring even</b> if he takes the mother for use as part of the ritual <b>to purify the leper.</b> The mishna compares the reward for performing the mitzva of sending away the mother bird from the nest to the reward for performing other mitzvot: <b>And if</b> with regard to the sending away of the mother bird, which is <b>a mitzva</b> whose performance is <b>simple, as</b> it entails a loss of no more than <b>an <i>issar</i>,</b> i.e., the value of the mother bird, <b>the Torah says: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7), it may be derived by <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference that the reward is no less <b>for</b> the fulfillment <b>of the mitzvot in the Torah</b> whose performance is <b>demanding.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The school of Rabbi Ya’akov taught that</b> Rabbi Ya’akov <b>says: There is not a single mitzva</b> written <b>in the Torah whose reward</b> is stated <b>alongside it, which is not dependent on</b> a belief in <b>the resurrection of the dead,</b> i.e., the reward is actually bestowed in the World-to-Come, after the resurrection of the dead. How so? <b>With regard to honoring one’s father and mother, it is written: “That your days may be long, and that it may go well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:16). <b>With regard to</b> the <b>sending</b> away of the mother bird from <b>the nest, it is written: “That it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:7).
Despite this, it occurred that <b>there was</b> one <b>whose father said to him: Climb to</b> the top of <b>the building and bring me fledglings; and he climbed to</b> the top of <b>the building and sent</b> away <b>the mother</b> bird <b>and took the offspring,</b> thereby simultaneously fulfilling the mitzva to send away the mother bird from the nest and the mitzva to honor one’s parents, <b>but as he returned he fell and died. Where is the length of days of this one? And where is the goodness</b> of the days <b>of this one? Rather,</b> the verse <b>“that your days may be long”</b> is referring <b>to the world that is entirely long,</b> and <b>“that it may be well with you”</b> means <b>in the world where all is well.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>But perhaps this</b> incident described by Rabbi Ya’akov <b>never occurred.</b> It is possible that everyone who performs these mitzvot is rewarded in this world, and the situation described by Rabbi Ya’akov never happened. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Ya’akov</b> himself <b>saw an incident</b> of this kind. The Gemara suggests: <b>But perhaps</b> that man <b>was contemplating sin</b> at the time, and he was punished for his thoughts. The Gemara responds: There is a principle that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not link a bad thought to an action,</b> i.e., one is not punished for thoughts alone.
The Gemara objects: <b>But perhaps</b> the son <b>was contemplating idol worship</b> at the time, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to idol worship: <b>“So I may take the house of Israel in their own heart”</b> (Ezekiel 14:5), <b>and Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says: This</b> is referring to punishment for the <b>thought of</b> performing <b>idol worship.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>This</b> is what Rabbi Ya’akov was <b>saying</b> after witnessing the incident mentioned above: <b>If it is so that there is reward for</b> performance of <b>mitzvot in this world, it should be effective for</b> the son <b>and protect him so that he not come to contemplate</b> idol worship <b>and be harmed. Rather,</b> one must conclude that <b>there is no reward for</b> performance of <b>mitzvot in this world.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: Those on the path to perform a mitzva are not</b> susceptible to <b>harm?</b> How is it possible that this individual, who was sent by his father to perform a mitzva, could have died? The Gemara answers: <b>When they return</b> it <b>is different,</b> as after one has performed the mitzva, one is susceptible to harm.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say: Those on the path to perform a mitzva are not</b> susceptible to <b>harm, neither when they</b> are <b>on their way</b> to perform the mitzva <b>nor when they are returning</b> from performing the mitzva? The Gemara answers: In that case, it <b>was a rickety ladder</b> on which the son ascended and descended, <b>and a place where danger is established is different,</b> and even those on the path to perform a mitzva are susceptible to harm. This is apparent from the incident where the prophet Samuel traveled to anoint David as king in place of Saul, <b>as it is written: “And Samuel said: How can I go? If Saul hears of it, he will kill me”</b> (I Samuel 16:2). Although Samuel was on the path to perform a mitzva, he feared that harm would befall him from established dangers.
<b>Rav Yosef said: Had Aḥer,</b> literally Other, the appellation of the former Sage Elisha ben Avuya, <b>interpreted homiletically this</b> aforementioned <b>verse:</b> “That it may go well with you” (Deuteronomy 5:16), as referring to the World-to-Come, <b>as</b> did <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, the son of his daughter,</b> he would <b>not have sinned.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What did</b> Aḥer <b>see</b> that led him to heresy? <b>Some say</b> that <b>he saw an incident like this</b> one witnessed by Rabbi Ya’akov, <b>and some say</b> that <b>he saw the tongue of Rabbi Ḥutzpit the disseminator, which was cast in a garbage dump</b> after he was executed by the government. Aḥer <b>said: Will a mouth that produced pearls</b> of wisdom <b>lick the dust? But he did not know</b> that the phrase <b>“that it may be well with you”</b> means <b>in the world where all is well,</b> and that the phrase <b>“that your days may be long”</b> is referring <b>to the world that is entirely long.</b>
