Daf 9b

 
 
  
 With whom does the Mishnah accord? It is R. Judah, as it is taught The first-born of a donkey is prohibited in benefit. But R. Shimon permits. 
     
    

  

  
 
 
  
 
 
   
 
  
Rabbah said: R. Shimon agrees that after its neck is broken it is prohibited to derive benefit from it.
What is his reasoning? He derives "breaking its neck" from "breaking its neck" connected to the heifer whose neck is broken.
