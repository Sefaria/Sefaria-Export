Tractate Derekh Eretz Rabbah



Chapter 1

When a man betroths<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">On the terms ‘betrothal’ and ‘marriage’ in Jewish law, cf. <i>Kallah</i>, p. 401, n. 1.</i> a woman, he debars himself from [marrying] seven blood relations, viz.: her mother, her mother’s mother, her father’s mother, her daughter, her son’s daughter, her daughter’s daughter and her sister while she herself is alive.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Yeb. 40a, b (Sonc. ed., p. 249).</i> In all these who are prohibited to him, the interdict is never lifted except in the case of his wife’s sister who is forbidden to him only during her lifetime;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. 18, 18.</i> and never does he disqualify his wife [from cohabitation with him] through [his intercourse] with her mother, her daughter or her sister.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The law applies to all the seven relatives. The three are mentioned probably because one might have thought that, on account of their close relationship, his wife would in such a circumstance be forbidden to him. Cf. Yeb. 94b-95a (Sonc. ed., pp. 643ff.).</i>
If [after betrothal the woman] was raped, she is permitted to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Deut. 22, 23-27.</i> but should she have been a willing party she is forbidden to him. If she is the wife of a <i>kohen</i>, she is forbidden to him whether [it happened] under force or with her consent. [For it is stated, <i>And she be not seized</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 5, 13, E.V. <i>neither she be taken in the act.</i> The phrase is interpreted by the Rabbis in the sense that she did not act under compulsion but willingly, referring to a married woman who was defiled secretly without witnesses to testify against her.</i>—[only then] is she forbidden; if, however, she was <i>seized</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. violated by force.</i> she is permitted. There is another class of woman who is forbidden [to her husband] even though she had been <i>seized;</i> and who is that? The wife of a <i>kohen</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Yeb. 56b (Sonc. ed., p. 378), Keth. 51b (Sonc. ed., p. 298).</i> R. Ishmael<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">According to R. Ishmael there is no distinction between the wife of a <i>kohen</i> and a lay-Israelite in the case of rape.</i> said: <i>And she be not seized</i> she is forbidden; consequently if she had been <i>seized</i> she is permitted. There is another class of woman who is permitted [to her husband] even if she had not been <i>seized;</i> and who is that? A woman whose betrothal was mistaken.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">If, e.g., a condition were attached to the betrothal that remained unfulfilled. In such a case the woman may leave her husband without a <i>geṭ</i>, and in any subsequent intercourse, whether forced or willing, her status is that of an unmarried woman who had never been previously married. The passage within brackets is added by GRA and is necessary, otherwise R. Ishmael would be contradicting himself. Cf. Yeb. 100b (Sonc. ed., p. 692), Keth. <i>loc. cit.</i></i>]<br>If a divorcee who became betrothed was seduced, whether under force or of her free will, she is forbidden to return to her former husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">If her second husband subsequently died or divorced her. She is, however, permitted to remarry her former husband after betrothal alone, where no marriage with the second man took place and he died.</i> This is the opinion of R. Jose b. Ḳippar in the name of R. Eleazar b. Shammua‘. This is the reasoning by which R. Jose b. Ḳippar expounded his view:<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reading of GRA as against V and H, who name R. Ishmael as the authority.</i> [It is written,] <i>Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 24, 4.</i> In what circumstances did she become defiled?<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">If she was legally married to the second husband the term <i>defiled</i> is inapplicable.</i> It can only be explained by what the Sages have said: If a woman [after betrothal] was forcibly seduced, she is permitted to [her husband]; if she was a willing party she is forbidden to him; but in this case,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Of the divorcee who became betrothed and was then seduced. This is the reading of GRA. V and H have ‘the wife of a <i>kohen’</i>.</i> whether under compulsion or of her free will she is forbidden to return to her former husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V and H ‘to him’.</i>
<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">V and H insert here ‘and this is the reasoning by which R. Jose b. Ḳippar expounded in the name of R. Eleazar b. Shammua‘’.</i> None of the women forbidden to him on account of incest requires a <i>geṭ</i> from him if he married any of them<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Such an unlawful marriage is regarded merely as harlotry, and we do not fear lest people infer that a married woman may leave her husband and remarry without a <i>geṭ</i>.</i> except his wife’s sister,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Whom he married after he had been told that his wife, who had gone overseas, was dead.</i> his brother’s wife<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Whom he married on the evidence that his brother (the woman’s husband) was dead but later returned. The requirement of a divorce in these cases is only a preventive measure against the possibility of assuming that the second marriage was legal, and hence inferring that a married woman may leave her husband to marry another without a <i>geṭ</i>.</i> and a married woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Whose husband was reported by one witness to be dead and she remarried with the sanction of a <i>Beth Din</i> who accepted the evidence, and later the husband returned. In such a case the woman requires a divorce from her second husband as a preventive measure against the possibility of assuming that the first had divorced her and the second had married her legally, and consequently a married woman may leave her husband without a <i>geṭ.</i> Cf. Yeb. 94b (Sonc. ed., p. 641).</i> because these have a termination to their prohibition.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘a permission after their prohibition’; e.g. by the death of his wife, by the death of his brother and by being divorced.</i>
The following exposition was given by R. Ḥanina b. Uri before [a gathering of] the Sages in the name of R. Nathan: Anyone who is included in the category <i>Shall not enter</i> [<i>into the assembly of the Lord</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 23, 2-4.</i> disqualifies a woman by his cohabitation<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">From marrying a <i>kohen</i> or from eating <i>terumah</i> if she was the daughter of a <i>kohen.</i> Cf. Ḳid. 74b (Sonc. ed., pp. 381f.).</i> and disqualifies the child.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">From his marriage. Such a child cannot be counted as belonging to the community. The reading of GRA is followed.</i> They are: an Ammonite,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 23, 4.</i> Moabite,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i></i> Egyptian,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 8f.</i> Idumean,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i></i> slave, bastard, <i>nathin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">A descendant of the Gibeonites; cf. Josh. 9, 27.</i> Samaritan<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Cuthean (Samaritan) was probably substituted from fear of the censor for an original <i>goï</i> (heathen).</i> and a <i>ḥalal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">One unfit for the priesthood on account of his father’s illegitimacy.</i> The daughter of a <i>ḥalal</i> is fit<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">To marry even a <i>kohen.</i></i> although [her father] is within [the category of] <i>shall not enter</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This is in accordance with the opinion of R. Dosethai b. Judah in Ḳid. 77a (Sonc. ed., p. 395), who maintained that as the sons of Israel are a <i>miḳweh</i> of purification for <i>ḥalaloth</i>, so are the daughters a <i>miḳweh</i> of purification for <i>ḥalalim</i>, so that their issue is eligible for the priesthood. The Mishnah (<i>ibid.</i>) states: The daughter of a <i>ḥalal</i> is unfit to the priesthood for all time.</i>
If a man had intercourse with any of the women prohibited to him as forbidden relatives, he is still permitted to marry her near relatives.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Only relatives of a married wife are subject to the law of incest.</i> [For instance,] he who had intercourse with a married woman is permitted to marry her daughter.
This is the question which R. Jose b. Taddai of Tiberias put to Rabban Gamaliel: If I, who may cohabit with my wife, am prohibited from marrying her daughter, how much more should I be prohibited from marrying the daughter of a married woman, seeing that I am prohibited from cohabiting with her!<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">The purpose of this <i>a fortiori</i> argument is to point out that one should not be allowed to marry anyone except the daughter of a widow or of a divorcee, because these are no longer a man’s wife.</i> He replied to him: Go and provide me [a wife] for the High Priest of whom it is written, <i>A virgin of his own people shall he take to wife</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 21, 14.</i> and I will provide you [with wives] for Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Since a High Priest may not marry a widow or a divorcee, their daughters also ought to be prohibited according to R. Jose’s argument, and this would be contrary to the Scriptural text. Hence the reasoning must be fallacious. The premise is false, viz. that he is permitted to cohabit with his wife who was the daughter of a married woman.</i> Another explanation<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The Yalḳuṭ omits the words ‘another explanation’.</i> [in refutation of the reasoning is that] we do not use an <i>a fortiori</i> argument to abrogate a specific law of Scripture.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">It is explicitly stated, <i>He shall take to wife</i>, but if we adopt R. Jose’s argument, a High Priest could never marry.</i> Rabban Gamaliel excommunicated him.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The Yalḳuṭ omits this sentence.</i>
If a man cohabits with any woman forbidden him as incest, he does not thereby disqualify her from marrying a <i>kohen</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Yeb. 61b (Sonc. ed., p. 409) where R. ‘Aḳiba maintains that the term <i>harlot</i> forbidden to a <i>kohen</i> applies only to one who is in fact a prostitute. GRA omits ‘not’. Higger quotes the suggestion of Prof. L. Ginzberg that there is a scribal error through dittography and the text should read: ‘Not only is the child a bastard but he even disqualifies her from marrying a <i>kohen’</i>.</i> [If a <i>kohen</i> cohabits with his wife when she is] <i>niddah</i>, although he is liable to a penalty for the intercourse,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. 18, 19.</i> the child [who is conceived] is qualified to stand and offer sacrifices upon the altar.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The offspring of a forbidden but valid marriage cannot be considered a <i>ḥalal.</i> Cf. Yeb. 60a (Sonc. ed., p. 399).</i><br>A woman who had intercourse with that which is not a human being,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. an animal; <i>ibid.</i> 59b (Sonc. ed., p. 397).</i> although she is in consequence subject to the penalty of <i>kareth</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">If the offence was committed in the presence of witnesses after due warning, the penalty is stoning (Lev. 20, 16); in the absence of witnesses and warning, she is under the penalty of <i>kareth.</i></i> she is not disqualified from marrying a <i>kohen</i>. R. Jose said: It once happened at Haitali<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The Babylonian form of Aitalu, the modern Aiterun, N.W. of Ḳadesh; cf. S. Klein, <i>Beiträge</i>, p. 47.</i> that while a young woman was cleaning the floor<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘house’; she must have been kneeling.</i> a gorilla<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">In Yeb. <i>loc. cit.</i>, ‘a wild dog’.</i> came and covered her from the rear. When the case came before the Sages, they did not disqualify her from marrying a <i>kohen</i>.
The following are the forbidden relatives in the second degree: his father’s mother, his mother’s mother,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">The Bible only prohibits a man’s mother and the Rabbis extended the prohibition to his mother’s mother on account of his mother. His father’s mother is likewise prohibited as they are both called ‘grand-mothers’.</i> the wife of his mother’s father, the wife of his father’s father,<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">The previous note applies here <i>mutatis mutandis</i>.</i> the wife of his son’s son, the wife of his daughter’s son, the wife of a father’s maternal brother, the wife of a mother’s paternal brother. Bar Ḳappara adds the mother of his father’s father and the mother of his mother’s father. The wife of his father’s brother is forbidden to him<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 18, 14.</i> but the daughter [his cousin] is permitted to him; his father’s brother is permitted to marry his<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">The nephew’s.</i> wife or his daughter; the wife of his mother’s brother is forbidden to him but his daughter is permitted to him. His mother’s brother is permitted to marry [the nephew’s] wife or daughter.<br>A man is permitted to marry the wife of his father-in-law<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Yeb. 21a (Sonc. ed., p. 124).</i> and the wife of his son-in-law, but the Sages said that the wife of his father-in-law is not permitted to him because of appearance’s sake; [the mother-in-law’s] daughter is permitted to him.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">After the death of her sister, his wife.</i> A man may not marry the daughter of his stepson,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">It is forbidden in Lev. 18, 17, and is not an incest of the second degree. It is only included here on account of the clause that follows. Cf. Yeb. <i>loc. cit.</i></i> but [the stepson’s] wife is permitted to him. His stepson is permitted to marry [the stepfather’s] wife and daughter. A man may marry the wife of his brother’s son and the wife of his sister’s son.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">This is a repetition of what is stated above in connection with a nephew’s wife and daughter. [A table of prohibited marriages is provided in Hertz, <i>The Pentateuch and Haftorahs</i>, Leviticus, pp. 186f., Sonc. ed., p. 559.]</i>
If a man remarried his divorced wife after her marriage [with a second husband who subsequently died or divorced her], he may not cohabit with her, neither may a levir marry her [if her husband died childless].<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. Cf. Yeb. 11b-12a (Sonc. ed., pp. 57f.).</i> The wife of a fit man who has a brother who is crushed in his privy parts<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 23, 2.</i> is permitted to her husband but is prohibited to the levir.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">If her husband died childless.</i> The rival<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Where a husband has more than one wife, each woman is a ‘rival’ in relation to the other.</i> of a <i>soṭah</i> is permitted to her husband but forbidden to the levir.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Both the rival and the <i>soṭah</i> are exempt from the levirate marriage and <i>ḥaliẓah</i>, because a <i>soṭah</i> is in the same category as a forbidden relative.</i><br>A man who married a sister of his brother’s divorced wife or a sister of his brother’s <i>ḥaluẓah</i>, [though this sister] is permitted to her husband she is forbidden to the levir [if her husband died childless].<br>The wife of a man crushed in his privy parts who has a fit brother, though forbidden to her husband,<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Deut. 23, 2.</i> is permitted to the levir. A <i>soṭah</i> is forbidden both to the husband and to the levir.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘to this one and to that one’.</i> A <i>ḥaluẓah</i> is likewise forbidden to both. The wife of a man crushed in his privy parts whose brother is similarly maimed is forbidden to both.
A female proselyte, captive woman, freed woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">These are presumed to have had intercourse.</i> the widow of one who was of mixed family,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘a widow of dough’. ‘Dough’ is a designation for a mixed community or family, i.e. with an admixture of illegitimate persons or persons of doubtful legitimacy. The reference here is to a girl, and not necessarily to a widow of a member, of such a mixed family. This is in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Gamaliel; cf. Keth. 14a (Sonc. ed., p. 76).</i> a <i>soṭah</i>, [56<i>a</i>] <i>ḥaluẓah</i>, divorcee and a <i>ḥalalah</i> are unfit to marry a <i>kohen</i>. If they were married to a lay-Israelite, the daughters [of the union] are fit to marry a <i>kohen</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ḳid. 77a (Sonc. ed., pp. 393f.).</i>
He who cohabits with a maidservant is liable to the penalty for transgressing fourteen negative commands and also to the penalty of <i>kareth</i> at the hand of Heaven, viz.: <i>Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 19, 19. The list given here is according to the text of GRA. Cf. Sanh. 82a (Sonc. ed., pp. 543f.).</i> <i>Thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i></i> <i>Neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i></i> <i>Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with two kinds of seed;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 22, 9.</i> <i>Thou shalt not plough</i> [<i>with an ox and an ass together</i>];<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 10.</i> <i>Thou shalt not wear a mingled stuff;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 11.

And one punishment of <i>kareth</i>, as it is stated, <i>May the Lord cut off to the man that doeth this him that calleth and him that answereth out of the tents of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the Lord of hosts</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Mal. 2, 12.</i> If he was a lay-Israelite and profaned his seed with a maidservant or a heathen woman, he will have no ‘awakening’<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. instruction. ‘Awakening’ and ‘responding’ correspond in the Heb. to <i>him that calleth</i> and <i>him that answereth</i> in Mal. 2, 12.</i> among the Sages and no ‘responding’ among the disciples. If he was a <i>kohen</i>, he will not have a son <i>that offereth an offering unto the Lord of hosts</i>.
Who marries a wife fitting for him;<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. of good lineage and standing.</i> Elijah kisses and the Holy One, blessed be He, loves him; but who takes a wife who is not fitting for him, Elijah binds and the Holy One, blessed be He, lashes him.<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reading of GRA in agreement with Ḳid. 70a (Sonc. ed., p. 354).

Abba Hilfai said in the name of his father Abba Ḥagra: Do not be rash in making vows that you may not trespass in the matter of oaths,<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Which are more stringent; cf. Ned. 20a (Sonc. ed., p. 56), Demai II, 3 (Sonc. ed., p. 58).</i> and do not be the guest of a <i>kohen</i> who is an <i>‘am ha-’areẓ</i> lest he give you consecrated food<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">e.g. <i>terumah.</i> According to this reading the exhortation is to a non-<i>kohen</i>. R.N. (cf. Ned. <i>loc. cit.</i>) reads ‘unclean consecrated food’, which was forbidden even to a <i>kohen</i>, in which case the exhortation is addressed to a <i>kohen</i>.</i> to eat. Do not converse much with women because every conversation with a woman is only about unchastity.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">This statement is not meant to be derogatory of women, who were held in high esteem, but was conditioned by the prevailing laxity in morals which characterized many of the ancient peoples.

Concerning Sadducees, informers, the wicked, profaners of God’s Name<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 9, 18. For ‘profaners of God’s Name’, which is GRA’s reading, V has ‘flatterers’.</i> and heretics, Scripture declares, <i>The wicked shall return to the nether-world</i>.

R. Dosethai b.

Chapter 3

Ben ‘Azzai said: Whoever sets the following four things [constantly] before his eyes and upon his heart will never commit a sin: Whence he came, whither he goes, Who is his Judge and what he is destined to become. Whence he came? From a place of darkness. Whither he goes? To a place of thick darkness. [Another reading:] Whence he came? From a place of uncleanness. Whither he goes? To cause others to be unclean.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The human body, when dead, causes ritual defilement.</i> [Another reading:] Whence he came? From a fetid drop and from a place which no person is able to behold.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The womb.</i> Whither he goes? To the nether-world to be judged in Gehinnom<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V and H read ‘and Abaddon’, a name for the nether-world.</i> and burnt in fire. And Who is his Judge? He must realize that his Judge is not of flesh and blood but the Lord of all works, blessed be He, with Whom there is no injustice, forgetfulness, respect of persons or taking of bribes. What is he destined to become? A worm and maggot; as it is stated, <i>How much less man, that is a worm! and the son of man, that is a maggot!</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Job 25, 6.</i>
R. Simeon said: A man is [full of] worms during his life and [full of] maggots when dead. He is full of worms during life—i.e. vermin, and full of maggots when dead—i.e. what swarms when he is dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Another possible interpretation is that he feels the bite of maggots even when he is dead; cf. Shab. 13b (Sonc. ed., p. 54), ‘Worms are as painful to the dead as a needle in the flesh of the living’.</i>
R. Eleazar b. Jacob said: Man is comely and praiseworthy but emits an ugly expression from his mouth. To what can this be compared? To a large salon in the middle of which a tannary pipe was fixed. So is man: if now when he discharges excrement from his bowels he prides himself over other creatures, should he emit from his bowels foliatum,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">An ointment or oil prepared from the leaves of spikenard.</i> balsam or any other kind of aromatic spice, how much more would he pride himself over other creatures!<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Following the text of GRA. Cf. above, p. 543.</i>
Shortly before R. Eleazar b. Azariah died, his disciples went in to visit him.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ber. 28b (Sonc. ed., p. 173).</i> They sat in front of him and said, ‘Master, teach us the ways of life’.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V has ‘only one subject’.</i> He said to them, ‘My sons, what can I teach you? Go and let each of you be solicitous for the honour of his colleague; and when you stand up to pray, know before Whom you stand and pray; for on that account you will [be worthy to] enter into the life of the World to Come’.
Five things we learnt from R. Eliezer at the time of his death, and we had greater joy over what we then learnt than over what he taught us during his life.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">They rejoiced because his teaching was accepted. The laws which he taught in his lifetime were rejected since he had been excommunicated. After his death the ban was lifted.</i> They are: a ball, a shoe-last, an amulet, <i>tefillin</i> and a cushion can become unclean, and [if unclean] may be immersed just as they are.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">For the explanation of this teaching, cf. ARN XIX, p. 108, n. 6. Instead of ‘as they are’ another reading is <i>bemashehu</i>, i.e. in a small quantity of water and not the full measure of forty <i>se’ah.</i></i> Go and pay due regard to them, because they are important ordinances which were told to Moses on Mount Sinai.

Chapter 4

You should always be pleasant on entering and leaving [a house]. Spend less time on business and occupy yourself with [the study of] the Torah. It once happened that R. Simeon b. Eleazar<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Others read ‘R. Eleazar b. R. Simeon’. But the story here related is more befitting the character of his son, R. Simeon. Cf. B.M. 85a (Sonc. ed., p. 487).</i> was coming from Migdal Eder<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In the extreme south of Judah.</i> from the house of his teacher and was riding leisurely on his ass by the seaside.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In Ta‘an. 20a (Sonc. ed., p. 100) ‘riverside’.</i> A certain man<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">According to some it was Elijah who wanted to teach him a lesson.</i> chanced to meet him, who was exceedingly ugly. He said to him, ‘Raḳa,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘empty one’, good-for-nothing.</i> how ugly are the children of Abraham our father!’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Some versions read: ‘Are all your fellow-citizens as ugly as you?’ Cf. above, p. 295.</i> The other replied, ‘What can I do for you? Speak to the Craftsman Who made me’. R. Simeon b. Eleazar immediately dismounted from the ass, prostrated himself before him<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">R. Simeon realized that he had done wrong.</i> and said to him, ‘I apologize to you, forgive me’. He replied to him, ‘I will not forgive you until you go to the Craftsman Who made me and say to Him, “How ugly is the vessel which You have made!” ’ R. Simeon walked behind him for three <i>mil</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">V and H ‘half a <i>mil’</i>.</i> When his fellow-citizens heard [of his arrival] they came out to meet him, greeting him with the words, ‘Peace be upon you, Rabbi’. The man said to them, ‘Whom are you calling Rabbi?’ They answered, ‘He who is walking behind you’. Thereupon he exclaimed, ‘If this man be a Rabbi, may there not be any more like him in Israel!’ He told them the whole story. They earnestly begged him to pardon him, and he replied, ‘I will forgive him, but only on condition that he does not act<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA and H. V has ‘speak’.</i> in the same manner again’.<br>That same day R. Simeon sat and expounded in his great Academy: Be always pliable like the reed and not unyielding like the cedar. In the case of a reed, though the four winds of the world were to blow upon it, the reed bends with them, and when the winds drop, it remains standing in its place, with the result that one is able to make a pen of it to write a scroll of the Torah. But the cedar is not like that: if the east, north [or] west wind blows upon it, it cannot move it from its place; but as soon as the south wind blows upon it, it uproots it and the result is that people come and cut it up,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The translation follows the corrected text of GRA.</i> chop it and use it for building houses, and what is left is used for firewood. Therefore the Sages said: Be always pliable like the reed and not unyielding like the cedar.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ta‘an <i>loc. cit.</i></i>
How does one honour his teacher? When they are both walking along the way, he must place himself at his<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The teacher’s.</i> left hand and not at his right. If three [were walking together] and a Sage or a teacher was among them, the teacher is to be in the middle, the more important of the other two on his right and the less important on his left. We find it so in connection with the three angels who came to Abraham our father, viz. Gabriel, Michael and Raphael. Gabriel came to overthrow Sodom and Gomorrah, Raphael came to heal Abraham<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Of the effects of his circumcision.</i> and Michael came to announce to Sarah [that she would have a son]. Michael was in the middle, Gabriel on his right and Raphael on his left.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Yoma 37a (Sonc. ed., p. 172).</i> When Abraham our father saw the Ministering Angels, the Divine Presence appeared and stood over him. He said to them, ‘Sires, wait until I take leave of the Divine Presence, which is greater than you’, as it is stated, <i>And he said: My lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 18, 3. Abraham addressed the chief of them and consequently the word <i>lord</i> does not signify God. Others interpret that he spoke to God, praying Him to wait until he had attended to his guests. They therefore cite here <i>ibid.</i> XVII, 22, <i>And He left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.</i></i><br>When Abraham our father had taken leave of the Divine Presence, he came, bowed to them and led them beneath the tree, as it is stated, <i>Let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XVIII, 4.</i> and afterwards [it is written], <i>And I will fetch a morsel of bread</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 5.</i> But [when the angels came] to Lot, what did he say? <i>And tarry all night, and wash your feet</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XIX, 2. Abraham had mistaken the angels for Arabs, who worship the dust of their feet and, being anxious not to introduce idolatry in any form into his house, he asked them to wash their feet first. Lot, however, who had no such anxiety, offered them a night’s lodging before asking them to wash their feet. Others, who give the interpretation which follows in the text, maintain that Lot also was anxious that they should first wash their feet, a custom he had learnt from Abraham; but the reason that he told them to stay the night before washing was to deceive the people of Sodom.</i> Others say: Lot spoke to them [in this manner] only as a clever device. He said [to himself], ‘If [the men of Sodom] find them with their faces, hands and feet already washed, the result will be that they will kill me, my wife and my daughters.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">For not reporting their arrival earlier.</i> Let them, therefore, find them with the dust still on their feet, and they will think that they have only just arrived’.
He who walks behind his teacher may not leave him without first obtaining his permission. If they were both equal in learning, the host enters [the house] first and then the guest, but when leaving the guest goes out first and the host leaves last.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The reason is not to leave the wife unprotected; cf. Ta‘an. 23b (Sonc. ed., p. 120).</i> He who is about to leave the company of his fellow,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V and H read ‘his teacher’.</i> whether he be greater than he or not, must say to him, ‘I am leaving’.

Chapter 5

A person should never leave [the company of his teacher or even] his fellow unless he had previously obtained his consent. All can learn such good manners from the All-present, Who said, as it were, to Abraham, ‘I am now leaving’, as it is stated, <i>And the Lord went His way</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">God notified Abraham that He was departing.</i> <i>as soon as He had left off speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned unto his place</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 18, 33.

A person should never enter into someone else's house suddenly.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

In the morning he again asked him, ‘Master, would you like us to call on our companion the philosopher?’ He replied, ‘Yes’. R. Joshua went and knocked on the door. The philosopher thought and said [to himself], ‘This can only be the manners of a Sage’. [When he knocked] a second time, [the philosopher] got up and washed his face, hands and feet. On the third knock he arose and opened the door and saw the Sages of Israel coming all together.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘some from here and some from there’.</i> Rabban Gamaliel was in the middle, R.

Always let all people [who visit you] be regarded by you as robbers, but show them the same respect as to Rabban Gamaliel. The story is told of R. Joshua on whom a certain person called early in the morning. He gave him food and drink, and took him up to the loft to sleep and then removed the ladder from under him. What did that man do? He arose in the middle of the night, collected the vessels<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Which were stored in the loft.</i> and wrapped them up in his cloak. As soon as he started to descend,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Thinking that the ladder was still there.</i> he fell from the loft and broke his neck. When morning came, R. Joshua rose early and found him where he had fallen. He said to him, ‘Raḳa!<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. p. 545, n. 5.</i> do all persons act as you have?’ He replied, ‘Master, I did not know that you had removed the ladder from under me’. He said to him, ‘Raḳa! Do you not know that already yesterday<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">From the moment you arrived</i> we were suspicious of you?’ Hence R. Joshua said: Always let all men be in your eyes as robbers, but show them the same respect as to Rabban Gamaliel.

Chapter 6

If one enters a house [by invitation], whatever the host tells him he must do.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Some eds. add: ‘providing it is a thing permitted to be done’. Cf. Pes. 86b (Sonc. ed., p. 456, n. 6) where the margin adds ‘except depart’. This is probably meant humorously—a guest should not outstay his welcome until he is told to go! Others read <span dir="rtl">מצא</span> for <span dir="rtl">מדא</span> ‘except a forbidden thing’, which harmonizes with the addition in our text.</i> The story is told of R. Simeon b. Anṭipaṭros with whom many guests used to come and stay. When he pressed them to eat and drink, they vowed by the Torah that they would neither eat nor drink, but later they partook of food and drink. When the time came for them to depart he used to flagellate them. This matter came to the notice of Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai and the Sages who were angered by it. They said, ‘Who will go and inform us [of his action]?’ R. Joshua replied, ‘I will go and see how he conducts himself’.<br>He went and found him at the entrance of his house and greeted him, ‘Peace be upon you, Master’. The other replied, ‘Peace be upon you, Master and Teacher’. He said, ‘I need a lodging’. The other replied, ‘Lodge here in peace’. They sat down and occupied themselves in the study of the Torah until evening. In the morning [R. Joshua] said to him, ‘Master, I want to go to the bath-house’. He replied, ‘As you wish’;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Not a positive approval.</i> whereupon R. Joshua was afraid lest he would smite him on his thighs. After he returned [from the bath-house] they ate and drank. He then said, ‘Who will accompany me [on my way back]?’ The other replied, ‘I will’. R. Joshua was then meditating and saying [to himself], ‘What can I report to the Sages who sent me [to institute inquiries]?’<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Since there was nothing untoward in the man’s behaviour.</i> He then turned [to look] back. [R. Simeon] asked him, ‘Master, why did you turn to look behind you?’ He replied, ‘I have something to ask you. Why did you flagellate other guests who stayed with you and me you did not flagellate?’ He said to him, ‘Master, you are a great Sage and you have good manners. The persons who stay with me I usually press to eat, but they vow by the Torah [not to eat] and transgress [their vow]; and so have I heard from the mouth of the Sages that whoever vows by the Torah and breaks his vow has to be given forty lashes’. He said to him, ‘May Heaven bless you for what you have done. By your life and by the life of your head! Whoever behaves in this manner, give him the forty lashes on your account [57<i>a</i>] and [another] forty on account of the Sages who sent me’.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. I do not mind how much you flagellate him.</i> R. Joshua returned and reported to the Sages what he had witnessed while he was with Simeon b. Anṭipaṭros.
A man should never be fastidious concerning his meals. It once happened that Hillel the Elder had a certain man to a meal, when a poor person came and stood at his door and said, ‘I am to marry today and have no provisions at all’. Hillel’s wife took the entire meal [which she had prepared] and gave it to him. She then kneaded fresh dough, cooked another dinner and placed it before them. He said to her, ‘My dear, why did you not bring it to us sooner?’ She told him all that had happened. He said to her, ‘My dear, I, too, did not judge you in the scale of guilt but in the scale of merit, because everything you did was only in the name of Heaven’.
We do not leave over a portion of the food in a stew-pot, but we should leave over a portion of the food in the dish.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The text is emended by GRA to agree with ‘Erub. 53b (Sonc. ed., p. 373). Cf. also Midrash Lamentations 1 (Sonc. ed., p. 85). V and H insert ‘not’ in the second instead of the first clause. When food is poured from the pot into the dish, none should be left over in the pot for the servant; but when the contents of the dish are ladled into the plates, some must be left in the dish for him.</i> It once happened that R. Joshua was the guest of a certain widow who served him with a dish of beans. He ate without leaving any. On the second occasion he also ate without leaving any. On the third occasion she over-seasoned it with salt; and as soon as R. Joshua tasted it he withdrew his hand from it and ate his bread dry. She asked, ‘Why did you withdraw your hand from the pounded beans?’ He replied, ‘I had already eaten earlier in the day’. She said to him, ‘You should then have withdrawn your hand also from the bread’. ‘Perhaps,’ she continued, ‘you left [the dish today] as compensation for the former meals!<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">When you ate it all.</i> But have not the Sages said: We do not leave over a portion of the food in the stew-pot but we should leave over a portion of the food in the dish!’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The corrected text of GRA is reproduced in translation. The hostess subtly rebuked R. Joshua for not having left some of the food.</i><br>Hence R. Joshua said, ‘No one has ever had the better of me except this woman, a little boy and a little girl’. What was the incident with the little girl? Once R. Joshua was walking in a field when he met a little girl who called out to him, ‘Why are you walking across the field?’ He replied, ‘I am walking along a [trodden] path’. ‘Robbers like yourself,’ she retorted, ‘have trodden it down.’ What was the incident with the little boy? Once R. Joshua was on a journey and came across a little boy sitting at a cross-road. He asked him, ‘My son, by which road will I be able to go to the town, by this one or by that?’ He replied, ‘Both of them are before you; but this one is long and short and that one is short and long’. [He proceeded along the short but long road.] When he approached the city’s wall, he found that it was surrounded by gardens and orchards, and turned back. Noticing the same little boy sitting where he had left him, he said, ‘My son, why did you play a trick on me? Did you not tell me that this road was short?’<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA.</i> ‘Master,’ he retorted, ‘you are a great Sage and this is your wisdom? Did I not tell you that it is long?’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The last words are inserted by GRA.</i> R. Joshua went and kissed him upon his head and exclaimed, ‘Happy are you, O Israel, for all of you are wise, both young and old’.
How does one dance before a bride?<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">What does one recite or sing in praise of a bride?</i> Beth Shammai said, ‘The bride as she is’.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">One should not exaggerate, and if she is obviously not beautiful one should not say that she is.</i> Beth Hillel said, ‘Beautiful and graceful bride’.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Every bride should be complimented.</i> Beth Shammai said to Beth Hillel, ‘According to your view, if she were lame or blind one still has to call her “beautiful and graceful bride”, but the Torah has declared, <i>Keep thee far from a false matter!</i>’<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 23, 7.</i> Beth Hillel replied to Beth Shammai, ‘If one has made a bad purchase in the market, should one praise it in his eyes or depreciate it? Surely one should praise it in his eyes’. Therefore the Sages said: The disposition of man should always be pleasant with people.
One should break off a piece of bread<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For the purpose of reciting the Grace before meals.</i> only from the part that is baked to a crust and not from the soft part;<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. a piece of the outer surface must be taken for the purpose and not the inner dough.</i> neither should one hold in his hand a piece [of bread] as big as an egg,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">And eat it all at once; he should only eat a quantity as large as an olive.</i> because one who acts in this manner is a glutton and a tippler, neither should a man drink his goblet of wine in one draught, and if he did so he is a tippler and a glutton.

Chapter 7

When two sit at one table, the senior of them puts forth his hand first<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">To pick his portion from the dish. On the Oriental mode of dining, cf. Lane, <i>Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians</i>, p. 148.</i> and then the junior; if the junior puts forth [his hand first] he is a glutton.
The story is told of R. ‘Aḳiba who prepared a meal for his disciples. They<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The waiters.</i> served them with two dishes, one raw and the other cooked. First they served them with raw foods. The bright [pupil] among them took hold of the stalk with one hand and with the other tried to break a piece off, and when it did not come off he withdrew his hands from it and ate his bread dry.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">He realized that he could only break off a piece by using much force and that would be unmannerly.</i> The foolish [pupil], however, took hold of the stalk in one hand and bit into it with his teeth. R. ‘Aḳiba said to him, ‘Not so, my son; place your heel on it in the plate!’ After that a cooked dish was served to them, of which they ate their fill. Then [R. ‘Aḳiba] said to them, ‘My sons, I only did this to test whether you have good manners or not’.
A man should begin his mealtime at the fourth hour of the day<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. 10 a.m., the beginning of the day being 6 a.m.</i> and enter the bath-house only at the fourth hour of the day.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Not earlier.</i>

Lane, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 150, n. 2.</i><br>It is related of R. ‘Aḳiba that he went into a privy behind R. Joshua to watch his behaviour.

What is the reason that we do not wipe with the right hand? R. Eliezer said: Because one eats with it. R. Joshua said: Because one writes<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V has ‘drinks’.</i> with it. Rabban Gamaliel said: Because one points with it to the cantillations of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">[In a copy of the Heb. Bible when reading it aloud; cf.

A man should not rejoice when among people who weep or weep when among those who rejoice. He should not stay awake among people who sleep or sleep when among those who are awake.

Chapter 8

A guest should not say to his host, ‘Serve me that I may eat’, but [must wait] until he is invited to eat. If they poured out a goblet [of wine] for him he must drink it with pauses.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Not in one draught. Cf. above, p. 554.</i> How many pauses should he make? In the case of warm [beverages] three and with cold four. R. Judah said: This applies only to goblets of Galilee,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Which were small.</i> but with goblets used in Judah<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Which were large.</i> he drinks with as many pauses as he likes.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Without appearing haughty.</i>
A man should not say to his fellow, ‘Come and eat [with me in return] for the food you gave me’, because this is a kind of usury.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">He may give him a more elaborate meal than he had eaten at the other’s house.</i> In Jerusalem, however, they used to exchange invitations one with another.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA.

A man should not send to his fellow a barrel of wine and put oil at its mouth,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Leading him to believe that the whole barrel contained oil.</i> because this may lead to fatal consequences. It once happened that a man arranged a banquet in honour of his son; when his guests arrived and sat down at the table, he went to get the oil.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA and H. V reads ‘wine’, with a similar change in the next sentence.</i> When he discovered that the barrel was full of wine he strangled himself and died.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">From shame, since he had nothing else prepared to set before his guests.</i> Hence the Sages said: A man should not send to his fellow a barrel of wine and put oil at its mouth, because it may lead to fatal consequences.
A man should not say to his fellow, ‘Take oil’ from an empty jar,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">When he knows that the man will not do so.</i> because the latter would be grateful to him without cause.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">He gains the gratitude of the man through something which he had no intention of doing. This is the reason in all the cases mentioned.</i> A man should not urge his fellow to dine with him knowing that he will not do so; and he should not offer him many gifts when he knows that he will not accept them.
A man should not pass off new wine for old<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V reverses the adjectives. H omits this sentence.</i> when giving his friend a drink because that is a kind of robbery.

Chapter 9

A man should not break bread over a dish,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Lest crumbs fall into it and fastidious persons would not eat from the dish.</i> wipe the plate with a piece of bread, or gather the crumbs and leave them on the table, because such action is objectionable to men.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Following the text of GRA; also in the next sentence.</i> One should not wipe the plate with a piece of bread and leave it on the table, because such action is objectionable to men. A man should not bite off a piece of bread and return it to the plate; similarly he should not bite off a piece of bread and give it to his fellow, because not all tastes are alike. He should also not drink from a cup and hand it to his fellow because of danger to life.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The man may be fastidious and yet be forced to drink from it.

[The host] again handed him another goblet of wine from which he had previously drunk, and R. ‘Aḳiba said to him, ‘Take and drink it’. Ben ‘Azzai said to him, ‘How long will you give [R. ‘Aḳiba] goblets of wine which had previously been tasted!’
It is also related of R. ‘Aḳiba that he was staying at the inn of a certain man [57<i>b</i>] who took a piece of bread and used it to support his plate.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Displaying disrespect for food.</i> R. ‘Aḳiba snatched [the bread] and ate it.

Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said the following five things [concerning bread]: we may not place raw meat on bread,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">So as not to spoil it; this is the reason in all the cases mentioned.</i> we may not pass a cup [full of wine] or a plate [of soup] over bread, we may not throw bread, we may not rest a dish on bread and we may not sit on articles of food because it would crush them.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It is disrespectful even if he does not make it repugnant. H reverses the order of the paragraphs.</i><br>A guest may not take his portion and give it to the attendant, lest something untoward happen to [the rest of] the meal;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">And the guest will have had nothing to eat.</i> but he should take [his portion], keep it in front of him and later hand it to the attendant.
Guests may not give anything [from what is set before them] to the host’s son or to his servant or deputy unless they have received the host’s permission to do so. It once happened that in a time of scarcity a man invited three guests to his house and only had three eggs<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Some read ‘food of the size of three eggs’.</i> which he set before them. When the host’s child entered and stood before them, one of the guests took his portion and gave it to him; the second guest did the same and so did the third. When the father came in and saw him with one egg in his mouth and holding two in his hands, he picked him up to his full height and flung him to the ground so that he died. When the mother saw her child dead she got up from [her seat] upon the roof<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The text in Ḥul. 94a (Sonc. ed., p. 529) states that she went up to the roof.</i> and threw herself down and died. On seeing this, the father also stood on the roof and threw himself down and died. R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: Because of this three souls perished.

Chapter 10

On entering a bath-house one should say, ‘May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, that Thou cause me to enter in peace and depart in peace, and that Thou cause me to return [to my house] in peace, and deliver me from this heat and its like in the future’.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

He then puts on his underwear and his shirt, binds his girdle, dons his cloak, [puts his hat on] and finally his shoes.

On entering a privy one should say, ‘Be honoured, ye honoured and holy beings who minister to the Most High! Give glory to our God and stay where you are.
