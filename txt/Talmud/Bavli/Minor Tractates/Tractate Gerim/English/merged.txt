Tractate Gerim



Chapter 1

If a man wishes to become a proselyte he is not accepted at once but they<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Rabbis who consider his application.</i> say to him, ‘Why do you want to become a proselyte? Do you not see that this people are debased, oppressed and degraded<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">‘Debased’ in themselves, ‘oppressed’ by others, and ‘degraded’ in consequence. MS.K. and H read ‘lowly and persecuted’.</i> more than all other peoples, that diseases and chastisements come upon them and they bury their children and children’s children, that they are slaughtered for [observing] circumcision, immersion<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">To purify themselves after ritual defilement.</i> and the other precepts [of the Torah] and cannot hold up their heads<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘behave in public’.</i> like other peoples?’
If he says, ‘I am not worthy’, they dismiss him and he goes his way.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">MS.K. and H read: ‘If he says, “I am not worthy to place my neck under the yoke of Him Who spoke and the world came into being, blessed be He”, they receive him forthwith, and if not he is dismissed and goes his way’. In Yeb. 47a. (Sonc. ed., p. 311), the reading is ‘I know and yet am unworthy’ of the privilege of membership of Israel.</i>
If, however, he undertakes [to become a proselyte], they take him down to the place of immersion, cover him in water up to his middle,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The place of nakedness.</i> and tell him some of the details of the precepts. [He is informed that he is accepted only] on condition that he will give gleanings, forgotten sheaves, the corner of the field and tithes.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. 19, 9; Deut. 24, 19; Num. 18, 26ff.; Deut. 14, 22ff.; XXVI, 12ff.</i>
As they say this to a man, so they say to a woman that [she is accepted] on condition that she will be particular in regard to <i>niddah, ḥallah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Added by MS.K. and H.</i> and the kindling of the Sabbath lamp.
When he has bathed and come up [out of the water], they speak to him words of kindness and comfort<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">So MS.K. and H, V ‘appropriate words’.</i> [saying], ‘To Whom are you cleaving? Happy are you! [You are cleaving] to Him Who spoke and the world came into being, blessed be He; for the world was created only for the sake of Israel;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf. Midrash Rabbah, Leviticus, XXXVI, 4 (Sonc. ed., p. 461): ‘The heaven and earth were only created for the sake of Israel’, because God foresaw that they alone would accept the Torah, without which the universe could not endure.]</i> only Israel are called “sons of God”,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf. Deut. 14, 1.]</i> and only Israel are [described as] “beloved of God”.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">[To be understood in the light of the dictum, ‘Beloved are Israel, for unto them was given the desirable instrument’, i.e. the Torah (Aboth III, 18, Sonc. ed., III, 14, p. 37).] MS.K. omits the clause.</i> All the things we have said to you<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">viz. at the beginning, ‘Why do you want to become a proselyte?’</i> we have said only to increase your reward’.
If a proselyte has been circumcised but has not yet bathed [he is a proselyte]; if he has bathed but not yet been circumcised [he is not yet a proselyte]; everything depends on the circumcision. This is the view of R. Eliezer, but R. ‘Aḳiba said: Also<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>’af</i> with MS.K. and H instead of <i>’en</i> (not) in V. [Cf. the discussion on the subject in Yeb. 46a, b (Sonc. ed., pp. 302ff.).]</i> [the lack of] bathing is a bar.
Anyone who becomes a proselyte for the sake of [marrying a Jewish] woman, or out of fear, or love<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">[Of the Jews, perhaps deriving material advantage from his conversion.]</i> is not a proselyte. Similarly R. Judah and R. Nehemiah said: All [the Gentiles] who were converted in the days of Mordecai and Esther were not genuine proselytes, as it is stated, <i>And many from among the peoples of the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews was fallen upon them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Esth. 8, 17.</i> Anyone who is not converted from purely religious motives<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘to the name of Heaven’.</i> is not a proselyte. [60<i>b</i>]
A man gives immersion to a man, and a woman to a woman but not to a man.
If a man became a proselyte who had vessels of wine<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">[Wine in the possession of a Gentile is termed <i>yayin nesek</i>, ‘wine of libation’, and is forbidden to Jews on the suspicion that it may have been used in idolatrous rites.]</i> in his possession and he says, ‘I am positive that none of it has been poured out as a libation’, the wine is permitted to him and forbidden to others. R. ‘Aḳiba said: <sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">A comparison with Tosiftha Ṭohoroth sec. 9 shows that there is a lacuna in the text and that R. ‘Aḳiba is speaking of the case where the wine had not been made by the proselyte himself but by another Gentile.</i>If it is forbidden to others, surely it is forbidden to himself! If he says, ‘[The wine has been made] in a state of purity in the presence of So-and-so who is a <i>ḥaber</i>, he is believed’.<br>Similarly should an <i>‘am ha-’areẓ</i> take upon himself to become a <i>ḥaber</i>, and he had food which should be in a state of ritual purity and said, ‘I am positive that it has been prepared in ritual cleanliness’, it is permitted to him and forbidden to others. R. ‘Aḳiba said: If it is forbidden to others, all the more it is forbidden to himself! But if he said, ‘It was prepared in ritual cleanliness in the presence of So-and-so who is a <i>ḥaber’</i>, he is believed.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph is omitted in V and inserted in MS.K. and H.</i>
If an Israelite lends money to a Gentile or a Gentile lends money to an Israelite and he became a proselyte, he collects the principal but not the interest.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">MS.K. reads: ‘One (i.e. the proselyte) takes the capital only (because being now a Jew he may not take interest from a Jew [cf. Lev. 25, 36f.], and the other (the Jew) takes the interest as well’. The reason is that if this were not done, it might be suspected that the Gentile became a convert to escape paying the interest.</i> R. Judah said: If before conversion he turned the whole into a loan,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. added the interest to the principal and wrote a fresh contract for the whole sum as a loan.</i> he collects the whole.
How [is the law]? If a first-born son was born to him before he was converted, he is exempt;<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">From his redemption (cf. Ex. 34, 20). MS.K. and H read: ‘If a son were born to him or his cow calved or his cow were slaughtered before he was converted, he is exempt’ from the priestly dues.</i> but if after he was converted he is liable; in case of doubt he is exempt. If he had dough ready for baking and a field ready for reaping, until he is converted he is exempt<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">From <i>ḥallah</i> and the tithe.</i> but from the time he is converted he is liable. If there is doubt he is exempt.

Chapter 2

There is a proselyte who is circumcised at eight days old<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">So MS.K. and H. V wrongly, ‘a proselyte is always circumcised at eight days old’.</i>. How is this? If he was born before his mother [who became a convert] underwent immersion he is circumcised at a day old,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. he is made a proselyte at the earliest moment.</i> but if after his mother underwent immersion at eight days old.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Like a child of a Jewish mother.</i>
If a proselyte was already circumcised, or if a child was born circumcised, it is necessary to draw from him blood of the covenant,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">A slight incision is made to draw a drop of blood.</i> according to Beth Shammai; but Beth Hillel say that it is not necessary.
R. Mathia b. Ḥeresh said in the name of R. Ishmael:<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">So MS.K. and H. V has ‘Samuel’.</i> Beth Shammai and Beth Hillel did not differ on the question of a proselyte who was already circumcised or a child who was born circumcised. On what did they differ? On a child who was born circumcised on the Sabbath. Beth Shammai said: We override the Sabbath on his account to draw from him blood of the covenant, and Beth Hillel said that this is not necessary.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">To set the Sabbath aside, and the blood should be drawn on another day. Both Schools agreed that it was necessary to draw the blood of the covenant.</i>
If a slave underwent immersion before his master<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A Gentile who was being made a convert.</i> he becomes free. It is related of Queen Valeria<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">[In Yeb. 46a (Sonc. ed., p. 299) ‘Queen’ is omitted. R.H. 17b (Sonc. ed., p. 70) mentions ‘Valeria the proselyte’.] Some of her slaves became Jewesses while she was still a heathen.</i> that some of her slaves underwent immersion before her and some after her, and when the case came before the Sages they said that they who underwent immersion before her were free, but they who underwent immersion after her were still enslaved.
Just as Israel were initiated into the covenant by three precepts, so proselytes are initiated by circumcision, immersion and a sacrifice. [The omission of] the first two debars him [from becoming a proselyte], but [the omission of] the third does not debar him. R. Eliezer [b. Jacob] said: The omission of the sacrifice is also a bar.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Omitted by V but added by MS.K. and H. Cf. Kerith. 9a (Sonc. ed., p. 66).</i> This was the ruling of R. Eliezer b. Jacob: A proselyte who becomes a convert is required to set aside a fourth part [of a <i>dinar</i>] for his sacrifice of birds;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">To be offered when the Temple will be rebuilt; Kerith. <i>loc. cit.</i> (Sonc. ed., p. 67, n. 12).</i> but R. Simeon says that he is not required to do so.
Proselytes are punished [for their sins before conversion] in the opinion of R. Jose; R. Judah said: He is not punished [61<i>a</i>] but is like a new-born child. 
R. Ḥanina b. Gamaliel said: Why are proselytes afflicted?<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">By God.</i> Because they calculate a year before or two years before [their conversion], saying, [‘I shall become a proselyte] when I have collected my debts and when I have finished what I have to do’. R. Jose said to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">‘R. Jose … him’ added by MS.K. and H.</i> ‘If they were to lose money [only as a punishment] you would be right; but they [sometimes] bury their children and grandchildren and sore diseases and chastisements befall them. Why are they afflicted? Because of their [transgression<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">While they were still Gentiles.</i> of] the seven commandments which were given to the descendants of Noah’.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">[The practice of equity, and prohibitions against blasphemy, idolatry, immorality, bloodshed, robbery and eating a limb torn from a live animal; Sanh. 56a (Sonc. ed., pp. 381f.).]</i>

Chapter 3

What is a ‘resident proselyte’?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <i>ger toshab</i> as distinguished from <i>ger ẓedeḳ</i>, ‘a righteous proselyte’.</i> Whoever undertakes to abstain from idolatry, in the view of R. Meir; R. Judah said: Whoever undertakes not to eat flesh that has not been ritually slaughtered.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">According to ‘A.Z. 64b (Sonc. ed., p. 314) a <i>ger toshab</i> is defined as one who undertook to keep all the commandments except the prohibition against eating flesh not ritually slaughtered, and perhaps that should be the reading here.</i>
His spittle, his seat, his couch and his urine are unclean; his bread,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">So MS.K. and H; V ‘his dough’.</i> his oil and his wine are clean. The prohibitions <i>thou shalt not do him wrong</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 19, 33.</i> <i>thou shalt not oppress</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 24, 14.</i> and <i>the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 19, 13.</i> apply to him.
We do not marry him [to a Jewess] or take to wife women from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Those within the category of <i>ger toshab</i>.</i> We do not lend to him or borrow from him on interest.
We do not settle him on the frontier<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">[Where he would be exposed to attack, or by intercourse with foreign neighbours lapse into heathenism.]</i> or in an unhealthy district, but in a pleasant district in the centre of the Land of Israel,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">The words ‘in the centre of the Land of Israel’ are superfluous and should perhaps be omitted.</i> where he can find scope for his occupation, as it is stated, <i>With thee he shall dwell in thy midst, in a place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, thou shalt not wrong him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 23, 17.</i>
Every incestuous marriage which is forbidden to Israel under pain of death at the hands of a <i>Beth Din</i> is<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">So MS.K. V and H insert ‘not’. [The question is debated in Sanh. 57b-58a (Sonc. ed., p. 393).]</i> forbidden to proselytes.
How is this? If he was married to the sister of his mother and her sister from the [same] mother, R. Meir says that he must dismiss her, but the Sages say that he may keep one of them.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is the lit. rendering of V, which is hopelessly corrupt. MS.K. and H read: ‘How is this? If he was married to the sister of his father from the same father or the sister of his father from the same mother, R. Meir says that he must dismiss her, but the Sages say that he may keep her. [If he has married] two sisters from the same mother, R. Meir says that he must dismiss both, but the Sages say that he must dismiss one of them’. The instance here adduced has nothing to do with the statement which precedes. In Sanh. <i>loc. cit.</i> it is adduced as an illustration of the statement that ‘a proselyte whose conception was not in holiness, but whose birth was in holiness (i.e. after his mother’s conversion) is forbidden to his mother’s relatives but not to his father’s’. In that case, however, we should certainly have to read here, ‘if he had married his father’s sister from the same father he may keep her, but if from the same mother, R. Meir says’, etc.</i>
An Israelite<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">This is an obvious mistake for ‘a Gentile’. [Cf. Sanh. 57b (Sonc. ed., p. 393) where it is explicitly stated.]</i> who has had intercourse with the daughter of a Gentile is to be tried according to the non-Jewish law, but a Gentile who has had intercourse with the daughter of an Israelite is to be tried according to Jewish law.
If a proselyte died leaving a son or daughter who became a convert with him, his property is ownerless<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">[There is nothing in V corresponding to ‘is ownerless’ which is required by the context. MS.K. and H insert ‘is like the deer’, i.e. free, ownerless.]</i> and his slaves regain their freedom. If the slaves were minors<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">[This is the reading suggested by N.Y.; V, MS.K. and H have ‘shrewd’. This version agrees with Ḳid. 23a (Sonc. ed., p. 110): ‘If a proselyte dies [without heirs] adult slaves acquire their freedom, but as for minors, whoever takes possession of them gains a title to them’.]</i> they are acquired by ‘drawing’,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">[‘Taking possession by drawing towards one’s self the object to be acquired’ (Jastrow).]</i> because [the Sages] said that movable property is acquired by ‘drawing’ and immovable property by seizure.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">[This is the correct reading as against V’s ‘the Sages said that movable property is acquired by seizure’. Cf. Ḳid. I, 5 (Sonc. ed., p. 124). ‘Movable property’ is lit. ‘property which has no security’, i.e. on which a creditor cannot distrain if sold; ‘immovable property’, on the other hand, like real estate, can be mortgaged for the owner’s debts.]</i>
R. Eliezer said: [Immovable property] is acquired only by seizure; but if someone was walking in the field [of a proselyte who died] and a man came up to him to whom he said, ‘The field is mine’, the field is his; but the Sages say that he does not acquire the property until he has taken possession of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">[By performing some act such as levelling, etc. Cf. B.B. 100a (Sonc. ed., p. 418, n. 7).]</i>
If one man comes from the south and another from the north, each one acquires the part which he traverses. This is the view of R. Eliezer; but the Sages said: Neither acquires until he has taken possession.
[If a proselyte died] while liable for his wife’s <i>kethubah</i> and [the claim of] a creditor and she says, ‘This part of the property belongs to me and this part is due to me under my <i>kethubah</i>’, she is entitled [to the whole]. If she says, ‘This part is due to me under my <i>kethubah</i> and this part belongs to me’, she is entitled only to her <i>kethubah</i>.
Similarly, if a creditor says, ‘This part belongs to me and that part is for my debt’, he is entitled [to the whole]; but if he says, ‘This part is for my debt and that part belongs to me’, he is entitled only to his debt.
If he had slaves pasturing a flock<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Following the text of MS.K. and H.</i> and someone came and said, ‘These slaves and the flock are mine’, they are his; but if the slaves are shrewd they can say, ‘We are free men and the flock belongs to us’.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">By declaring themselves freemen they can inherit their master’s property.</i>

Chapter 4

<i>And a stranger</i> [<i>ger</i>] <i>shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 22, 20.</i> you shall not <i>wrong</i> him in speech or <i>oppress</i> him in money dealings. Do not say to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">What follows is according to MS.K. For Bel, etc., cf. Isa. 46, 1, <i>Bel boweth down</i> (<span dir="rtl">קרס</span>), <i>Nebo stoopeth</i>, alluding to Babylonian deities.</i> ‘Yesterday you were worshipping Bel, Ḳores and Nebo, and till now pig’s flesh was between your teeth, and now you stand up and speak with me!’ And whence [do I learn] [not] to <i>wrong</i> him? He can retort, <i>For ye were strangers in the land of Egypt?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. <i>loc. cit.</i> [The more correct version is found in Mekilta <i>ad loc.</i>: ‘If you wrong him he is able to wrong you? Therefore there is a saying, <i>For ye were strangers</i>, etc.’</i> Hence R. Nathan used to say: Do not taunt your neighbour with the blemish which you yourself have.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf. B.M. 59b (Sonc. ed.,p. 356).]</i>
R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: Because [the proselyte’s] original nature was evil,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">[When he was a heathen, and ill-treatment by an Israelite may have the effect of making him relapse.]</i> Scripture gave many warnings in connection with him, as it is stated, <i>And a stranger shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him; for ye know the heart of a stranger</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 23, 9.</i> Hence because his original nature was evil, Scripture gave many warnings concerning him.
Beloved are proselytes [by God], for [Scripture] everywhere uses the same epithets of them as of Israel; [61<i>b</i>] as it is stated, <i>But thou, Israel, My servant, Jacob whom I have chosen</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. 41, 8. <i>Jacob</i> is here interpreted as <i>ibid.</i> XLIV, 5, <i>And another shall call himself by the name of Jacob</i>—these are the proselytes of righteousness (cf. towards the end of this tractate). The order of the quotations in V is confused.</i> The term ‘love’ is applied to Israel, as it is stated, <i>I have loved you, saith the Lord</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Mal. 1, 2.</i> and the term ‘love’ is applied to proselytes, as it is stated, <i>And He loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 10, 18.</i> Israel are called ‘servants’, as it is stated, <i>For unto Me the children of Israel are servants</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 25, 55. V omits the quotation.</i> and proselytes are called ‘servants’, as it is stated, <i>To be His servants</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. 56, 6.</i> The term ‘acceptable’ is used of Israel, as it is stated, <i>And it shall be always upon his forehead, that they may be accepted before the Lord</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 28, 38.</i> and the term ‘acceptable’ is used of proselytes, as it is stated, <i>Their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon Mine altar</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. 56, 7.</i> The term ‘keeping’ is applied to Israel, as it is stated, <i>The Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 121, 5.</i> and the term ‘keeping’ is applied to proselytes, as it is stated, <i>The Lord preserveth the strangers</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> CXLVI, 9.</i> The term ‘ministering’ is applied to Israel, as it is stated, <i>But ye shall be named the priests of the Lord, men shall call you the ministers of our God</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. 61, 6.</i> and the term ‘ministering’ is applied to proselytes, as it is stated, <i>Also the aliens, that join themselves to the Lord, to minister unto Him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> LVI, 6.</i><br>Beloved are proselytes seeing that our father Abraham did not circumcise himself when he was twenty or thirty years of age, but when he was ninety-nine years old;<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Gen. 17, 24.</i> since if he had circumcised himself when he was twenty or thirty years old, no Gentile would have become a proselyte when he had passed the age of twenty or thirty. The Holy One, blessed be He, kept putting it off<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The verb has fallen out of V.</i> until he had reached ninety-nine years, so as not to close the door in the face of proselytes, [and to allow more days and years so as to increase the reward of those who do His will, as it is stated, <i>The Lord was pleased, for His righteousness’ sake, to make the teaching great and glorious</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. 42, 21. The passage within brackets is added by MS.K. and H.</i><br>Our father Abraham called himself a <i>ger</i>, as it is stated, <i>I am a stranger</i> [<i>ger</i>] <i>and a sojourner with you</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 22, 4.</i> Similarly David, king of Israel, called himself a <i>ger</i>, as it is stated, <i>For I am a stranger</i> [<i>ger</i>] <i>with Thee</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 39, 13.</i> and likewise it states, <i>For we are strangers before Thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">1 Chron. 29, 15.</i><br>Beloved is the Land of Israel because it makes proselytes fit [to be received]. If a man says in the Land of Israel, ‘I am a proselyte’, he is accepted at once, but outside the Land of Israel he is not accepted unless his witnesses are with him. Beloved is the Land of Israel because it atones for iniquities and transgressions, as it is stated, <i>And the inhabitant shall not say: ‘I am sick’, the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. 33, 24.</i><br>And so you find in the four classes that stand before the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is stated, <i>One shall say: ‘I am the Lord’s’; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and surname himself by the name of Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XLIV, 5.</i> <i>One shall say: ‘I am the Lord’s’</i>—this alludes to one who belongs wholly to the Omnipresent and has no admixture of sin. <i>Another shall call himself by the name of Jacob</i>—this alludes to the proselytes of righteousness.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">A term to denote the genuine and complete convert.</i> <i>Another shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord</i>—this alludes to those who repent. <i>And surname himself by the name of Israel</i>—this alludes to those who fear Heaven.
