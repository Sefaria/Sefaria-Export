Tractate Soferim



Chapter 1

It is not permitted to write [the sacred] books,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The scrolls of the Pentateuch used for the lections in public worship.</i> <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzoth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">These two nouns are added by GRA and M. For Hebrew and other terms, see the Glossary.</i> on skins of ritually unclean cattle or on skins of ritually unclean wild animals. Nor may they<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The parchment sheets of which the scrolls are made up.</i> be sewn with their sinews, or [the parchment rolls of <i>tefillin</i>] be wound with their hair. It is an oral prescription delivered to Moses at Sinai that [all these] shall be written on the skins of ritually clean cattle or ritually clean wild animals, be sewn together with their sinews and [the <i>tefillin</i> rolls] wound with their hair. It is also an oral prescription delivered to Moses at Sinai that [the parchments] shall be ruled with a reed<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">To guide the hand of the scribe, the letters being written under the ruled lines.</i> and the writing on the skin be done with ink. [This latter requirement] has support in Scripture, <i>And I wrote them with ink in the book</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Jer. 36, 18.</i>
R. Joshua the grits-dealer was asked: ‘Why is it permitted to write [sacred scrolls] on the skins of <i>nebeloth</i> and <i>ṭerefoth?</i>’ ‘I will give you an analogy,’ R. Joshua replied. ‘This is similar to the case of two men who were condemned to death by the State, one being executed by the king and the other by the executioner. Which of them is superior? He who was executed by the king.’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Nebeloth</i> and <i>ṭerefoth</i> are the effect of an act of God.</i> ‘If so,’ he retorted, ‘they should be permitted to be eaten!’ ‘It is stated,’ replied R. Joshua, ‘<i>Ye shall not eat any</i> nebelah.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 14, 21. E.V. <i>of anything that dieth of itself</i>.</i> Scripture has forbidden it, so what can I do for you?’ (From here it is inferred that it is permitted to write on skins of <i>nebelah</i> and on skins of <i>ṭerefah</i> and there is no need to consider the possibility of their having been pierced at the animal’s heart.)<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence is enclosed in brackets in some eds. It was a heathen practice to remove the heart from a live animal to be offered as a sacrifice; this, in Rabbinic law, rendered the entire animal, including its skin, forbidden as an idolatrous offering (‘A.Z. 29b, Sonc. ed., p. 145).</i>
Skins<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Before they were dressed; but dressed skins may be bought only from trust-worthy persons who can testify that the dressing had been done in accordance with the law.</i> for the [sacred] books, <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzoth</i> may be bought anywhere, and one need not consider the possibility that they might be skins which were pierced at the animal’s heart.
The writing on <i>ḳelaf</i> must be on the side of the flesh, and on <i>gewil</i> it must be on the side of the hair, no deviation from this being permitted. It is an oral prescription delivered to Moses at Sinai that if one changed one for the other, [the scroll] may not be used for the lection [in the statutory services].
[The sacred texts]<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in Rule 1.</i> may not be written on <i>difthera</i> or erased paper;<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Others, ‘palimpsest’. GRA omits ‘erased’.</i> nor with coal,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Or, ‘black pigment’.</i> shoe-black, ink containing gum, vitriol or fruit-juice.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Others, ‘rain-water’, ‘wine-lees’.</i> Vitriol may not be added to the ink.
[The sacred texts] may not be written in [obsolete] Hebrew characters,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The script must be ‘Assyrian’ (the modern Hebrew square characters) and the language ‘the holy tongue’.</i> or in the Aramaic, Median or Greek languages.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">According to Meg. 9a (Sonc. ed., p. 48) it is permitted to write the Torah in Greek although this is not allowed in the case of <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzoth</i>.</i> If they were written in any other language or in any other characters they may not be used for the lection [in the statutory services], since they must be written in the Assyrian [script].
It once happened that five elders wrote the Torah for King Ptolemy<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Presumed to be Ptolemy Philadelphus who reigned over Egypt 285-247 <small>B.C.E.</small> He arranged for the Greek Version, the Septuagint, to be made, as narrated in the next paragraph. [The Tractate gives two accounts of the translation, the present one being the later which reflects the harmful effects which the Septuagint had in arresting the development of exegesis among the Hellenistic Jews (cf. Weiss, <i>Dor</i>, I, p. 90).]</i> in Greek, and that day was as ominous for Israel as the day on which the golden calf was made, since the Torah could not be accurately translated.
It also happened that King Ptolemy assembled seventy-two elders and placed them in seventy-two [separate] rooms without telling them the reason for which he had assembled them. He then went to each one of them and said to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘to them’.</i> ‘Write for me [a translation of] the Torah of Moses your master’. The Omnipresent inspired them<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘put counsel in the heart of each one of them’.</i> and the mind of all of them was identical, so that each on his own<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA.</i> wrote the [same translation of the] Torah, introducing [the same] thirteen alterations<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Deviations from the traditional text. In the extant Versions of the Septuagint only some of these are found.</i> as follows: ‘God created in the beginning’.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of <i>In the beginning God created</i> (Gen. 1, 1) the Heb. of which might be misinterpreted to mean that a power named ‘Bereshith’ (in the beginning) created God.</i> ‘And God said I shall make a man in image and likeness.’<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Heb. text reads: <i>Let us make man in our image, after our likeness</i> (Gen. 1, 26). The plural <i>us</i> and <i>our</i> might erroneously suggest a plurality of deities.</i> ‘And He finished on the sixth [day] and rested on the seventh [day].’<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">For the Heb.: <i>And He finished on the seventh day</i> (Gen. 2, 2) which could be understood to imply that God did some work on the seventh day.</i> ‘Male and female He created him.’<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of <i>created them</i> (<i>ibid.</i> V, 2) from which it might be inferred that man and woman were, from the first, two separate beings, contrary to <i>ibid.</i> II, 21.</i> ‘Come let Me go down and there confound their language.’<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of <i>let us go down</i> (<i>ibid.</i> XI, 7).</i> ‘And Sarah laughed among her relatives,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. she laughed in the presence of people and therefore incurred censure (<i>ibid.</i> XVIII, 12). The Heb. means ‘within herself’ as Abraham had done when he <i>laughed … in his heart</i> (<i>ibid.</i> XVII, 17) and had not been rebuked.</i> saying.’ ‘For in their anger they slew oxen<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA, H and M. V incorrectly ‘a man’.</i> and in their self-will they digged up a stall.’<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Changing <i>men</i> (<i>ibid.</i> XLIX, 6) to ‘oxen’ and <i>oxen</i> to ‘stall’ in order to remove the stigma of murder from Jacob’s sons.</i> ‘And Moses took his wife and his children and set them upon a carrier<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">So M. V and H read ‘carriers of men’.</i> of men.’<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. an animal conformable with the dignity of Moses, instead of <i>ass</i> (Ex. 4, 20).</i> ‘Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt and in the land of Canaan and in other lands<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">So M. V omits ‘and in other lands’. [The reading of the Septuagint is ‘in the land of Canaan and in the land of Egypt’.]</i> was four hundred and thirty years.’<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of the Heb. which omits ‘in the land of Canaan and in other lands’ (Ex. 12, 40), and implies that all the 430 years were spent in Egypt when, in fact, they could not have dwelt there more than 210 years (cf. Rashi to Meg. 9a).</i> ‘And he sent the elect of the children of Israel.’<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA and Meg. 9a but omitted in V. ‘Elect’ is substituted for <i>young men</i> (<i>ibid.</i> XXIV, 5), the former being regarded as more suitable persons for the service.</i> ‘And upon the elect of the children of Israel He laid not His hand.’<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Here also ‘elect’ was substituted for the Heb. for <i>nobles</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 11). The alteration was not essential, but ‘elect’ which was mentioned earlier was preferred. It should be noted that in the total of thirteen alterations, this and the preceding are counted as one.</i> ‘I have not taken one desirable thing<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">A ‘desirable thing’ [which occurs in the Septuagint] for the Heb. <i>ass</i> (Num. 16, 15) to avoid the suggestion that Moses did not take an ass but more precious objects.</i> from them.’ ‘The [beast] with small legs.’<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of the Heb. for <i>the hare</i> (Lev. 11, 6) which is <i>arnebeth</i>, so as not to give offence to Ptolemy the name of whose queen was Arnebeth.</i> ‘Which the Lord thy God hath allotted to give light unto all the peoples under the whole heaven.’<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">The insertion ‘to give light’ (Deut. 4, 19) removes the possible misunderstanding that the heavenly bodies enumerated in the verse were intended by God to be objects of worship.</i> ‘Which I commanded should not be served.’<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 17, 3 reads <i>which I have commanded not</i>. This might be taken to mean that God did not desire their existence and their creation was consequently due to a power beyond His control. It should be noted that the last two alterations are regarded as one in the enumeration because both deal with heavenly bodies as objects of worship.</i>
[The sacred scrolls] may not be written in gold. It is related that in an Alexandrian<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">So M. V and H read ‘a scroll of the Torah of Alexander’ [i.e. Alexander Jannaeus (103-76 <small>B.C.E.</small>) according to Krauss, <i>Lehnwörter</i>, II, p. 55].</i> scroll of the Torah all the divine names were written in gold, and when the matter came before the Sages they decided that it should be stored away.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘it shall be hidden’; not to be used for the lection.</i>
All the Torah is in Hebrew but it contains some Aramaic words.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘translation’ (<i>Targum</i>).</i> What is in Hebrew may not be written in Aramaic and the Aramaic words may not be altered; for example, <i>Jegar-sahadutha</i> and <i>Galeed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 31, 47, ‘the heap of witness’ in Aramaic and Hebrew.</i> Others hold that the rule applies only to <i>Jegar-sahadutha</i> and <i>Galeed</i> because they are two specifically Aramaic and Hebrew expressions respectively.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">In the case of the other parts, however, although one language should not be changed for another, the scroll is not disqualified if a change was made (cf. N.Y. <i>ad loc.</i>).</i> If Hebrew words were written in Aramaic or Aramaic words in Hebrew, the scroll may not be used for the lection. The Aramaic [and Hebrew] words referred to are <i>Jegar-sahadutha, Galeed</i> and the like.<br>If <i>ha’azinu hashshamayim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Give ear ye heavens</i>, the opening words of Deut. 32, 1-43, which is arranged in the scroll as follows:<br>_________________<br>_________________<br>_________________</i> was arranged like the Song of Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 15, 1-18 written as:<br>_________________<br>_________________<br>_________________<br>_________________<br>_________________<br>or, according to others:<br>_________________<br>_________________<br>_________________<br>_________________<br>_________________</i> or if the Song of Moses was arranged like <i>ha’azinu;</i> if continuous lines were written in broken ones or vice versa; [35<i>b</i>] or if the breaking up was not done according to the rule, the scroll may not be used for the lection.
If one finished [writing nearly] all the Torah and less than a column<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA and H. V reads: ‘If one finished all the column and left over less, one extends the wording so as to make’, etc. A reading in M is ‘if one finished all the book and left less than a column, one extends the writing so as to make’, etc.</i> remained of the text, one need not hesitate to make of this a small column on its own.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The extension of a short passage over a full column is done either by enlarging the characters or, according to others, by making each successive line shorter than the one preceding it.</i>
A [parchment] sheet [of the Torah scroll] containing six columns may be divided into two sheets;<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Each containing three columns.</i> but one of five columns may not be divided, in order that it should not<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA and N. Y. H and M read: ‘perhaps one might’.</i> be separated into one of two<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Not less than three columns may be contained in each sheet.</i> and one of three columns. No one is allowed to write [a scroll of the Torah] unless one is able to read.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">M inserts: ‘one is not allowed to write unless [the parchment] was ruled; and if an unruled sheet was written on, it is disqualified’.</i>
A scroll of the Torah that was written by a Sadducee,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">An adherent of a sect which was opposed to the teachings and traditions of the Pharisees. M adds <i>min</i>, a Jewish heretic or Jewish-Christian.</i> an informer,<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Against his fellow-Jews to the ruling Roman authorities. M adds <span dir="rtl">משומד</span>, an apostate.</i> a proselyte,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">This refers to a ‘proselyte settler’ (<i>ger toshab</i>), one who does not observe the commandments but, on account of domicile in the land of Israel, has renounced idolatry.</i> a slave, a woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA and M; not in V and H.</i> a madman or a minor may not be used for the lection.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">For the unsuitability of the persons enumerated, cf. Giṭ. 45b (Sonc. ed., p. 199).</i> This is the rule: Whosoever cannot act in religious matters on behalf of the public is not permitted to write a scroll of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V reads: ‘everyone who writes it [must be a person who] may act on behalf of the public [in discharging a religious obligation]’.</i>
If an open section was written as closed or vice versa, the scroll must be stored away. What is an open section? One which does not begin at the beginning of a line. And what is a closed section? [One which is separated from what precedes by a vacant] space in the middle of the line. And how much space must be left at the beginning of a line so that a section may be called ‘open’? A space in which a name of three letters may be written.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The view of Maimonides which has been adopted is that space must be left for three words, each of three letters (cf. Y.D. 275, §2).</i> And how much space must be left in the middle of a line so that a section may be called ‘closed’? A space in which a name of three letters may be written. If an entire section was completed at the end of a column, one vacant line must be left at the top [of the next column]; but if a vacant space in which a name of three letters may be written was left at the foot [of the column], one begins [the next column] from the top.

Chapter 2

Sufficient space must be left between words<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘between name and name’.</i> so that they can be distinguished, and between letters so that they be not mixed. If the letters were mixed or a break was made in the middle of a word, the scroll must not be used for the lection in the statutory services.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">In V Rule 1 is enclosed within brackets, probably because it is included in the fuller version in the next Rule.</i>
Between lines there must be left the space of a line, between words the space of a letter, between letters that of a hairbreadth, and between columns the space of the width of a thumb. If [a word at]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">So according to GRA.</i> the end of a column was copied<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘made’.</i> at the beginning [of the next column, the scroll] is disqualified. If the letters were mixed or if a break was made in the middle of a word, the lection may not be read from it.
It is permitted to insert<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘place’.</i> between columns [part of] a word of five<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">So N.Y. V, H and M read ‘four’.</i> letters. One may not write two letters within<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">So N.Y. V and H have ‘at the end’.</i> the column and three without;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Because the greater part of the word must appear within the column. So N.Y. V, H and M read ‘and two between the columns’. GRA emends to ‘one at the end of the column and three between the lines’.</i> but it is not so with a short word.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Of two letters (N.Y.). One letter may be written between columns (H).</i> If the [part of a longer word, however, forms] a short word of two<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V, H and M, ‘three letters’.</i> letters on its own,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In a noun like <span dir="rtl">שלחן</span> (table), for instance, which consists of four letters, the last two can form the word <span dir="rtl">חן</span> (grace).</i> it is forbidden [to insert it between the columns].<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The reading of GRA and N.Y.</i>
In a Torah scroll the space<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">So M, H and N.Y. V repeats ‘space’ unnecessarily.</i> of two finger-breadths must be left between columns, but in scrolls of the Prophets and ordinary Pentateuchs<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Intended for study only and not for public lections.</i> a space of one thumb-breadth only. In the lower margin of a Torah scroll the space of a handbreadth is left, and in the upper margin three fingerbreadths;<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">So H in agreement with Men. 30a (Sonc. ed., p. 195). V and M read ‘two parts of a handbreadth’.</i> but in scrolls of the Prophets and ordinary Pentateuchs three finger-breadths in the lower margin and two finger-breadths in the upper. In all these cases,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘here and there’.</i> if it is desired to extend [the margins] this may be done, provided they do not exceed [the space of] the written matter. Between the books<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘between a book and a book’. The Torah scroll consists of five books.</i> in a Torah scroll a vacant space of four lines must be left, and in a scroll of the Prophets three lines.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Both in the case of the major and minor Prophets (N.Y.).</i>
If one finished [writing nearly] all the book<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">So N.Y. V, H and M read ‘books’. The reference is either to one book of the Prophets or to several written in one scroll.</i> and one column of text remained, one need not hesitate to make a small sheet of it.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. I, Rule 11.</i> At the conclusion of the [last] column [sufficient parchment] must be left to wind [round the scroll]. It is proper<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘in the beginning’, ‘at the outset’.</i> to attach a roller to the end of a scroll for winding, but there is no need to attach one at the beginning of a scroll. In a Torah scroll, however, rollers should be attached at both ends. A scroll<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Prophets, having its cylinder at the end of the scroll.</i> is therefore rolled up towards the beginning but a Torah scroll<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Which has cylinders at both ends.</i> towards its<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">So H, M and GRA. V omits the pronoun.</i> centre. A Torah scroll may not be opened by [holding on to] a sheet;<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Owing to its sanctity. It must be opened by manipulating the cylinders. Another reading for <span dir="rtl">פותחין</span> is <span dir="rtl">פוחתין</span> (H, cf. N.Y.) which gives the clause the meaning that when a Torah scroll is used for reading the lection not less than a full sheet, which contains not fewer than three columns, must be kept unrolled throughout the reading.</i> and the height<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘length from top to bottom’.</i> of such a scroll must be six handbreadths.
A sheet of a Torah scroll must contain not less than three columns and not more than eight. As regards the lines [in a scroll] a reason was given [for four different numbers]: corresponding to the journeys,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">The reading of H and GRA. V and M have ‘in the journeys’.</i> forty-two; corresponding to the myriads of Israel, sixty; corresponding to the elders of Israel, seventy-two; and corresponding to the reproofs in Deuteronomy, [36<i>a</i>] ninety-eight; all depending on [the size of] the script.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The larger the characters the fewer the number of lines in a column.</i><br>‘Corresponding to the journeys,’ as it is said, <i>And Moses wrote their goings forth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 33, 2. As the expression of writing (<i>wrote</i>) occurs in the same context as the journeys (<i>goings forth</i>), the number of lines in a <i>written</i> column may be the same as the number of the journeys.</i> ‘Corresponding to the myriads of Israel,’ as it is said, <i>Write thou these words … and with Israel;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 34, 27. <i>Write</i> and <i>Israel</i> (numbering sixty myriads) occur in the same context.</i> as Israel numbered sixty myriads so may the lines of the Torah be sixty [in a column]. ‘Corresponding to the elders, seventy-two,’ as it is said, <i>Gather unto Me seventy men</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 11, 16.</i> … <i>there remained … in the camp … of them that were recorded</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 26. The number of the elders is found in the same passage as the expression of writing (<i>recorded</i>, lit. ‘written’).</i> ‘Corresponding to the reproofs, ninety-eight,’ as it is said, <i>If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 28, 58, <i>the words of this law</i> refers to the reproofs numbering 98 and occurs with <i>written</i> in the same passage.</i><br>In the case of <i>ḳelaf</i> parchments no limit was prescribed, and one may add [as many lines]<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">N.Y. explains, ‘sheets’.</i> as desired, provided only there are not less than three columns [to the sheet].<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the lines in a column, or according to N.Y. the sheets, should not be so many as to leave less than three columns for the last sheet of the scroll.</i>
If a sheet [of a Torah scroll] is worn out, one may not remove two [columns only]<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">So M. N.Y. (cf. Ṭur Y.D. 280) explains, ‘sheets’ instead of ‘columns’.</i> and replace them by two new columns; but three columns should be removed and replaced by three new ones, and the new columns must be written in the same size as the original script.
The width of a column [in a Torah scroll] must be such as to be recognizable at one glance,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. not more than three Heb. words, each of ten letters, could be written in a line. If the column is wider, the reader experiences difficulty in passing from line to line.</i> and in a small scroll not less than a handbreadth. R. Jose b. Judah says: It must not be less than the width of three fingers.
Half the length [of a column]<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Of text. This is exclusive of the upper and lower margins. Others explain, ‘sheet’, instead of ‘column’.</i> must not be greater than its width, nor its width greater than half its length, but they must be exactly alike,<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. The reading of V is: ‘he takes the middle course and so does it in’, etc.</i> and this is the most correct procedure.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Some versions omit ‘half’ twice in this paragraph which agrees with B.B. 14a (Sonc. ed., p. 67): ‘A scroll of the Torah should be such that its length does not exceed its circumference nor its circumference its length [when rolled up]’. On this reading, the paragraph deals with the size of the scroll in its entirety.</i>
A Torah scroll may not consist of half <i>gewil</i> and half <i>ḳelaf</i>, but it may consist of half <i>gewil</i> and half <i>ḳelaf</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">So Asheri (cf. N.Y.). V and H have the plural of <i>ḳelaf</i>.</i> of deers, although<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">GRA and others. V reads ‘because’.</i> this is not the best procedure.
[A tear in a parchment sheet of a Torah scroll] may not be joined with glue, nor is it permitted to write on a patch, nor may [the sheets] be sewn together on the written side. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said in the name of R. Meir: [A torn sheet] may be joined with glue and it is permitted to write on a patch. It is forbidden, however, to do the sewing<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">GRA, H and M. According to V ‘the writing’.</i> on the written side within but [it must be done] on the outside.<br>A space should be left [unstitched] at the top and at the foot [of the sheets] in order that the scroll be not torn [in use].<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">By leaving a part unstitched, the liability to tear when the scroll is rolled up would be reduced. GRA reads this paragraph as follows: ‘It is an oral prescription delivered to Moses at Sinai that a space should be left [unstitched] at the top and at the foot [of the sheets]. This, however, was at once qualified [by the Sages who questioned whether this was such an oral prescription or merely a rule] so that the scroll should not be torn [cf. Meg. 19b, Sonc. ed., pp. 118f]. If a Torah scroll was torn a patch may be placed on its outside’.</i> This, however, was at once qualified by adding: from the foot towards the top and from the top towards the foot. It is an oral prescription delivered to Moses at Sinai that, if a Torah scroll was torn, a patch may be placed on its outside.<br>In the case of the double letters of the alphabet,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">The five letters <span dir="rtl">כ׳, מ׳, נ׳, פ׳, צ׳</span> which have a different form as finals.</i> the first ones<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the letters in the non-final form.</i> are written at the beginning and in the middle of a word, and the second<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">The final letters.</i> at the end.

Chapter 3

It is permissible to join the Torah and the Prophets in one scroll, so R. Judah; but the Sages say: The Torah and the Prophets must be written in separate scrolls.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">So V, H, M. GRA adopts the reading of B.B. 13b (Sonc. ed., p. 66): ‘It is permissible to fasten the Torah, the Prophets and the Hagiographa [in one scroll]’.</i>
Between a book of the Prophets and another, one should not leave the same empty space as between two books of the Torah, but in each case the space must be that which has been prescribed for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">viz. four lines between books of the Torah, and three lines between books of the Prophets.</i> Furthermore, [a book of the Prophets]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If the preceding book ended at the foot of a column.</i> must begin at the top.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Of the next column, the reason being that, if the books of the Prophets were separated one from the other, the beginning of each book would commence at the top of a column. This does not apply to Torah scrolls which may never be cut up into separate books.</i>
A Torah scroll<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Which contains the five books of Moses.</i> may not be made into the separate books of the Pentateuch, neither into single books nor into two or three joined together, because it is forbidden to reduce a major sanctity<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah scroll in its entirety.</i> to a minor sanctity.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A section of the Pentateuch.</i> From scrolls containing sections of the Pentateuch, however, it is permitted to make up a Torah scroll. When may this be done? When the measurements<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Of all the scrolls that are to be joined together.</i> and the numbers of the lines<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In each column.</i> are alike.
It is not permissible to join together two sections of the Pentateuch or one and a half of them to form a single scroll.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Because it might be mistaken for a proper Torah scroll.</i> But if it was intended<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">When these were written.</i> that additional scrolls be attached to them,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">To complete a Torah scroll.</i> it is permissible.
It is related that Boethus b. Zonin<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">[A pious Jew at the end of the first cent. <small>C.E.</small>, not to be identified with the Boethus named in ARN V.]</i> had eight books of the Prophets<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the Twelve Prophets reckoned as one book.</i> joined together in one scroll in accordance with a ruling of R. Eleazar b. ‘Azariah. Others maintain that he had them all in separate scrolls. It is also related that a certain person brought before the Sages a single scroll containing the Torah, the Prophets and the Hagiographa.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">And, as recorded in B.B. 13b (Sonc. ed., p. 66), the Sages ruled that it was a proper scroll.</i>
This<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">That the Torah, Prophets and Hagiographa may be included in one scroll.</i> applies only to a codex,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Since, as a book for study, no one could attribute to it the sanctity of a Torah scroll.</i> but in the case of a scroll<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In that form only the contents could show whether it was a Torah scroll only.</i> the Torah and the Prophets must each consist of a separate parchment.
If a Torah scroll has spaces or stops [to mark] the beginning of verses, it may not be used for the lections.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Because the Torah scroll must conform to the original form without any alterations.</i> So also if a letter has been engraved or joined to another, the scroll may not be used for the lections.
A scroll [some of whose letters] are faded may not be used for the lections.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">So H and GRA. V reads ‘one should not rewrite them’.</i> R. Simeon b. Eleazar says: If the outline [of the effaced letters] is distinguishable, it is permitted [to rewrite them].
A scroll of the Torah in which a whole line is faded may not be used for the lections. If the greater part of a line is faded and the smaller part intact, the use of the scroll is permitted. If a Torah scroll contains an error, it may not be used for the lections. How many [errors disqualify it]? One in a column, is the view of R. Judah. R. Simeon b. Gamaliel says: Even if there be one error in three columns<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The reading of GRA. In V and M, ‘even three errors in a column’. The reading of H is: ‘Three in a column is the view of R. Judah. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel says: Even if there be one error in one column’.</i> the scroll may not be used for the lections.
Not less than three columns of the Torah scroll [may be unrolled at one time during the reading], but there is no objection to the reading of ten [columns] in one [lection]. It is a religious precept that the most important member<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Of the congregation, or of those who have taken part in the reading.</i> shall roll up the scroll.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Thus showing honour to the Torah.</i> When one rolls up a Torah scroll he should roll it [so that it closes] at the seam<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">So that if the scroll is pulled, only the seam will be affected.</i> and not at [the middle of] a sheet.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Which might be torn by the pull.</i> A Torah scroll should [36<i>b</i>] be rolled up<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V and M: ‘it shall not be fastened from within, but it must be fastened from without’.</i> from without,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the back of the written side, while the scroll is being held up by another person who is faced by the written side.</i> but the [band]<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Which is wound around the scroll to prevent it from unrolling.</i> should be tied from within.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The knot facing the written side. In this way, when the next lection is to be read, the knot can be easily undone without having to turn the scroll over.</i><br>When one hands a Torah scroll to another person it must be done with the right hand only, and he who receives it must also do so with the right hand only, because the Torah was delivered at Mount Sinai in this manner, as it is stated, <i>At His right hand was a fiery law unto them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 33, 2.</i><br>R. Shefaṭai<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">In Meg. 32a (Sonc. ed., p. 194) the name is Shefaṭiah.</i> said in the name of R. Joḥanan: If one reads the Scripture without a melody<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Indicated in the printed Pentateuch by the traditional cantillation.</i> or learns the Mishnah without a tune,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Which aids the memory.</i> of him Scripture says, <i>Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Ezek. 20, 25. An accompanying melody enlivens one’s studies, and endears the <i>statutes</i> which one learns. If such are described as <i>not good</i> it is because the melody is lacking.</i>
A scribe may not put upon the written part [of a Torah scroll] a reed-pen with ink on it; nor may he take hold of the sheets of parchment<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">So H. V, ‘folds’.</i> and thereby unroll [the scroll]; nor may he grasp them to extract the written sheets;<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Which are rolled up; lit. ‘and bring forth the writing without’.</i> nor may he remove a scroll from its [case] by shaking it out. All these [restrictions] are relaxed with the official revisers of Scripture scrolls. A Torah scroll may not be released from its case while it is lying on one’s lap<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘one shall not slip a Torah scroll from one’s lap and release it’.</i> because this is disrespectful treatment. It is not permissible to place a Torah scroll on one’s knees or lean on it with one’s elbows while reading; so according to the ruling of R. Nehemiah.
A Torah scroll may not be placed over a chair [with its sheets] hanging down while it is being read, in the manner of ordinary documents, because [sacred] books must not be treated with disrespect. The proper procedure is<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘but’.</i> to hold it in the hands<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">By means of a cloth since, according to Rule 16 below, it is forbidden to touch a Torah scroll with the bare hands.</i> with reverence and so read it. [Sacred] books<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Not only Torah scrolls (Maimonides).</i> may not be thrown about<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘from place to place’.</i> nor may they be treated in [any other] disrespectful manner.
A scroll of the Torah may not be placed on a bed and [certainly]<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. N.Y. The addition of ‘certainly’ avoids an anticlimax.</i> not at its foot or under it; nor may one sit on a bed on which a [Torah] scroll [happens to] rest. It is related that R. Eleazar once sat [unwittingly] on a bed on which lay a [Torah] scroll and [when he realized it] he jumped up as if a snake had bitten him. [Respect is shown for the Torah] because Scripture states, <i>Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 19, 30.</i>—it is not the sabbaths that one reverences but Him who commanded [to keep them], nor is one to reverence the sanctuary but Him who commanded [to make] it.<br>It is obligatory to make beautiful <i>ẓiẓith</i>, beautiful <i>mezuzoth</i>, to write a beautiful scroll of the Torah with choice ink, with a fine reed-pen [written] by an expert penman<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">[Reading with Bacher, <i>Ag. d. Tannaiten</i>, I, p. 254n <span dir="rtl">לבלר אומן</span> for <span dir="rtl">לבלרין נאים</span> (fine pen-men).]</i> on well-finished parchments, on deer skins,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V and H, ‘dyed skins’.</i> and to wrap it in precious silks; for Scripture states, <i>This is my God, and I will glorify Him</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 15, 2, <i>I will glorify Him</i> (<span dir="rtl">ואנוהו</span>) is connected homiletically with <span dir="rtl">נאה</span>, ‘beautiful’, and understood as ‘I will serve Him in a beautiful manner’.</i> which means, perform the commandments in a beautiful manner to His glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘before Him’.</i> Such is the interpretation of R. Ishmael. R. ‘Aḳiba expounds the text as meaning that one should expatiate on His excellencies. Abba Saul explains: Be like Him;<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">He explains <span dir="rtl">ואנוהו</span> as the equivalent of <span dir="rtl">אני והוא</span>, ‘I and He’.</i> as He is merciful and gracious so be thou merciful and gracious.
Foodstuffs may not be treated with disrespect, nor may they be thrown about. One may not sit on a basket containing dates or dried figs;<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Because they might be crushed and spoilt.</i> but he may sit on a basket which contains pulse or on a cake of pressed figs, because it is customary to do so.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Pulse or dried figs are not spoilt by sitting on them.</i> Foodstuffs may not be used as a support<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">For any object.</i> or as a covering, nor may foodstuffs be eaten with the aid of foodstuffs,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Using them, e.g., in place of a spoon.</i> unless [the latter] are fit to be eaten.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Immediately after use and would not be thrown away.</i> R. Eliezer b. Jacob says: Any fruit which has a stem or stalk<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Whereby it can be lifted if it should happen to fall into the contents of the vessel which it covered.</i> may be used as a covering.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Since it would not be necessary to throw it away after use.</i> R. Simeon b. Gamaliel says: Any foodstuff which requires processing may be used as a covering.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">In its raw state, since its use causes no deterioration.</i> R. Simeon b. Gamaliel also says: Any foodstuff which has a protection<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">e.g. a shell.</i> may be used as a covering. One who writes [Torah] scrolls may not turn over a sheet on its face<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘scroll’, with the writing downwards to protect it from falling dust while it is drying.</i> because this is disrespectful treatment.
If one finished [writing nearly] all the [Torah] scroll and left over one column, there is no objection to his arranging it on a small sheet [on its own].<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. I Rule 11 and II Rule 5.</i><br>Foodstuffs may not be used as a covering.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following are repeated from Rule 14.</i> R. Meir says: Any fruit which has a husk may be used as a covering. R. Judah says: Any fruit which has a stem or a stalk may be used as a covering.
Foodstuffs may not be eaten with the aid of foodstuffs unless they are consumed simultaneously. If a scroll cannot be covered with a cloth,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘on which there is no’. To protect the wet ink from dust while it is drying.</i> it may be turned over on its writing.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">This qualifies what was stated in Rule 14 in accordance with ‘Erub. 98a.</i> R.

Is this thinkable? It means, Without the covering protection of that religious performance.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">(65). The reverential treatment of the Torah scroll is accounted an act of piety.</i>

The following divine names may not be erased,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘he who writes’.</i> viz. <i>Alef-lamed</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Pronounced <i>’El</i> (God).</i> <i>Alef-daleth</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The first two letters of the divine name <i>Alef-daleth-nun-yod</i> (Lord).</i> <i>Yod-he</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The first half of the Tetragrammaton and also constituting a name of God, <i>Yah</i>.</i> <i>Shaddai</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Almighty.</i> <i>Ẓeba’oth</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">[Lord of] hosts.</i> <i>’Eheyeh ’asher ’Eheyeh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">‘I am that I am’ (cf.

Chapter 5

If one wrote a sacred name twice,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘he who writes a name of two sacred names’. H omits ‘a name of’.</i> he retains the first and erases the latter.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The first is retained because it was properly written; the second is erased because it was written in error.</i> R. Judah says: If the first occurs at the end of a column, he erases the first and retains the second.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">It spoils the appearance to leave a blank at the beginning of the top line of a column.</i> [If he wrote] a secular noun twice,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘two secular nouns’.</i> he retains the first and wipes away the latter.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">While the ink is still wet.</i> R. Judah says: If the first was at the end<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V and H, ‘at the top’.</i> of a column, he wipes away the first and retains the latter.
If one writes <i>Yehudah</i> and omits the <i>daleth</i>, he inserts<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘suspends’ between the <i>waw</i> and the <i>he</i>.</i> it above the line. If he intended to write the Tetragrammaton<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The four letters <i>Yod-he-waw-he</i>, lit. ‘the name’.</i> and wrote <i>Yehudah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">יהודה</span>.</i> instead,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reading of GRA and H. V omits ‘if he intended to write’,</i> he alters the <i>daleth</i> into a <i>he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This is done by adding a short vertical line to the <i>daleth</i>.</i> and wipes away the final letter <i>he</i>. If it was required to write <i>Yehudah</i> and he intended to write the Tetragrammaton, although he [inadvertently] inserted the <i>daleth</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">So H. V reads: ‘he did not write in it’.</i> he erases it<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Following GRA. V and H ‘detains it’.</i> and writes another <i>Yehudah</i>.
If it was required to write the Tetragrammaton but he intended to write <i>Yehudah</i>, although he did not insert the <i>daleth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">So that the Tetragrammaton was written correctly but unintentionally so.</i> he must wipe away [the entire word] and re-write the Tetragrammaton. R. Judah says: He should go over it with the reed-pen and so sanctify it. [The Sages] said to him: This is not the best procedure.
He who writes the divine name and made an error [by omitting] one letter should suspend it above [the line].<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Neither erasure nor wiping away of the written words is necessary.</i> R. Simeon of Shezur says: All the name may be suspended [if omitted] but a single letter of it may not be suspended. If one erred [by omitting] all the name, he should suspend it between the lines, according to the view of R. Judah. R. Meir says: He wipes away the writing that precedes and writes the name on the part which he wiped away. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said in the name of R. Meir: The name only may be suspended but the Tetragrammaton must not be written on an erasure. R. Ḥanina b. ‘Aḳabia says: The whole sheet<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In which the omission of the Tetragrammaton had occurred.</i> must be stored away.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">As with all sacred objects that are worn out or decaying, or are for any other reason unfit for further use. GRA revised the wording of this Rule to conform in the main with the text in Men. 30b (Sonc. ed., p. 196): ‘If the Tetragrammaton was omitted in error [and a number of the words following it already written], what had been written is erased, the erased words are suspended [above the line] and the Tetragrammaton is inserted in the space of the erasure; so R. Judah. R. Meir said: He wipes the writing away and writes [the Tetragrammaton] in the space. R. Jose said: Even the Tetragrammaton may be suspended [above the line]. R. Simeon of Shezur said: It is permissible to suspend all the Tetragrammaton [above the line] but not a part of it. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said in the name of R. Meir: The Tetragrammaton may not be written in a space which has been erased or wiped away, nor may it be suspended [above the line]; but the entire sheet is removed and stored away’.</i>
If one wrote three<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V ‘twice’.</i> times <i>Alef-lamed</i> by mistake in the phrase <i>God delivereth me to the ungodly</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Job 16, 11. The text has the word twice, the first being the divine name and the second the preposition; inadvertently he wrote it three times, intending the first two to stand for ‘God’ (thus sanctifying both) and the third for ‘to’.</i> he retains the first and erases the second.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA and H. The first occurrences of <i>’el</i> were meant to be the divine name and Rule 1 above applies. By quoting an illustration from Job, the inference to be drawn is that the regulation with respect to a Torah scroll holds good also of the Prophets and Hagiographa.</i>
When one is writing the Tetragrammaton he may not respond even if the king greets him.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">All his attention must be concentrated on the sanctity of the divine name.</i> If he was about to write two or three divine names successively,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">E.g. <i>The Lord, the Lord, God</i> in Ex. 34, 6.</i> he may pause between them and respond. After dipping the reed-pen in ink, he may not start with the letters of a divine name<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Because a pen full of ink may cause a blot.</i> but with the preceding letter.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Which, if blotted, can be erased or wiped away.</i> One who erases a single letter of a divine name transgresses a negative commandment. R. Simeon said:<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Citing the Scriptural basis of the regulation.</i> On account of this it is stated, <i>Ye shall destroy their name out of that place. Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 12, 3f, i.e. the name of God must not be erased.</i>
It is permissible, however, to wipe away ink that dropped upon the writing,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Even of a divine name.</i> since one’s intention is only to rectify it.
If one omits a line in error, he may not suspend it between the lines, but inserts it in close proximity<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘opposite’.</i> to the place<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V and H omit ‘inserts in … place of’.</i> of the error by erasing one [adjacent line] and inserting two<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The one omitted and the one erased.</i> in its place, or [by erasing] two lines and writing three;<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The two erased and the one omitted.</i> provided only that he does not erase three lines.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">In order to insert more than one missing line. The erasure of one or two lines is sufficient for the insertion of the omitted line without undue pressure on the space between the lines; but the treatment of more than one line in this manner would disfigure the entire column (N.Y.).</i>
It is not permissible to make a scroll of the <i>Shema‘</i> or of the <i>Hallel</i> for children,<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Extracts from Scripture may not be made for study by children.</i> but if the scribe intends to add to it, it is permissible.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">From ‘but if’ to ‘permissible’ is an addition by GRA.</i> R. Judah permits the writing of a scroll from <i>In the beginning</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 1, 1.</i> to the story of the flood,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. to Gen. 6, 8.

Moses<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">In V and H a passage has been interpolated after ‘Moses’ which has no relation to the subject-matter. It seems to have been originally a marginal note explanatory of the meaning of <i>hiḳni</i>’, an unusual verb to be employed in the sense of ‘warn’. It reads as follows: <i>Hiḳni</i>’, i.e. ‘he warned’, as we have learned in a Mishnah (Soṭ. I, 1), <i>hammeḳannë’</i> (of the same root as <i>hiḳni’</i> which means), If [a husband] ‘warns’ his wife [not to associate with a certain man], R. Eliezer said: His warning is valid if it was given in the presence of two witnesses, though he makes her drink [the water of bitterness] on the evidence of one witness [who saw that she had secluded herself with the man after she had been given due warning], because a warning is not valid if given in the presence of less than two witnesses; for [only where there are two witnesses] would she be able to plead, ‘I was not warned’, but when [there was only] one witness she might dare to plead, ‘I was not warned’.</i> warned<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>hiḳni’</i> some eds. read the normal verb <i>hithḳin</i>, ‘he established a custom, ordained’.</i> Israel that they should read out of the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In the service of the Synagogue.</i> on Sabbaths, Festivals, New Moons and the intermediate days of the Festivals;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘the secular [part] of the Festival’, the days intervening between the holy days which begin and end the Festivals of Passover and Tabernacles.</i> as it is stated, <i>And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 23, 44.</i>

On a Festival five [persons read from the prescribed portion of the Torah]; on the Day of Atonement, six; and on the Sabbath, seven. The number must not be reduced but may be increased.

Chapter 11

One who reads the Torah [in public worship] should read not less than three verses,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The number corresponds to the three main divisions of the Bible: the Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiographa; Meg. 24a (Sonc. ed., p. 143).</i> and he should not read for the interpreter<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Who translated and expounded the Heb. text into Aramaic for the congregation.</i> more than one verse [at a time].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">So that the interpreter, who had no book before him, should not become confused.</i> In the case of [the lection from] a Prophet, however, three [verses at a time may be read];<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">If desired.

It is permitted to skip from place to place in [a scroll of] a Prophet,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Omitting the intermediate portions.</i> but not in a Torah scroll, because [the scroll of] a Prophet may be unrolled in public but not of the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The unrolling of which might disturb the congregation.</i> Similarly ruled R.

Levi b. Paṭi enquired of R.

The passage is XXVIII, 15-68. Only with these passages, which are not restricted to a particular time, are the benedictions recited before and after they have been read; but with the <i>’arur</i> curses, which were spoken by the Levites only (cf. Deut. 27, 14) and at the time when the Jordan was crossed (<i>ibid.</i> 2), no benedictions are to be recited.</i>

The Song of the Well, appearing in the middle of a section, should consequently require no benedictions before and after its reading.</i> ‘Do you,’ the other retorted, ‘still require [a ruling] on this subject? All poems<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Such as the Song of the Sea (Ex. 15, 1-19), the Song of the Well and probably also Deut. 32, 1-43.</i> must be preceded and followed by benedictions.’

Similarly when one reads from the Prophets,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>hafṭarah</i> which is read after the conclusion of the prescribed section of the Torah.</i> a benediction is said as follows: ‘Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who hast chosen good prophets, and hast found pleasure in their words which were spoken in truth.

Chapter 14

And why did [the Rabbis] enact all these [benedictions]?<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For the <i>hafṭarah</i> as specified in the previous chapter.</i> In order to establish a correspondence between the seven benedictions [of the <i>hafṭarah</i>] and the seven readers.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The minimum number who must be called to the reading of the Torah every Sabbath.</i> You may also similarly explain the reason for the twenty-two verses read in the [Book of a] Prophet: twenty-two corresponding to the seven readers, each of whom must read [a minimum of] three verses, and one corresponding to the superintendent of the Synagogue services.
All that had been said<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In the preceding Rule concerning the minimum number of verses to be read in the Prophet.</i> applies only where the text was neither translated nor expounded; but where it was translated or expounded<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">So that much of the time of the worshippers was taken up by the translation or exposition.</i> the <i>mafṭir</i> reads three, five or six verses in the Prophet, and this suffices.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The reading is curtailed for the convenience of the congregation.</i>
In the case of Ruth, the Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Inserted by GRA and H.</i> Lamentations and Esther,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">These books are read respectively on Pentecost, Passover, Tabernacles, the Fast of Ab and <i>Purim</i>.</i> it is necessary to say the benediction, ‘Concerning the reading of the <i>Megillah</i>’,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The full benediction is: ‘Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments, and hast given us command concerning the reading of the <i>Megillah’</i> (P.B., p. 276).

One who reads in the Hagiographa must say, ‘Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments and hast given us command to read in the Holy Writings’.
[The Rabbis] enacted that, as regards [the reading of] the scroll of Esther, the benediction on the ‘season’ must be said;<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Like the benediction in the preceding note it begins with ‘Blessed art Thou … universe’ and concludes with ‘Who hast kept us in life, and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season’.</i> and after the conclusion of the reading the reader must say, ‘Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, O God Who dost plead our cause, judge our suit and avenge our wrong, Who redeemest and savest us from the hand of all tyrants.

The <i>mafṭir</i> recites also the parts of the <i>Shema‘</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This is explained below.

Thereupon<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘immediately’.</i> the <i>mafṭir</i> steps forward,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘enters’.</i> takes the scroll of the Torah and says, <i>Hear, O Israel</i>, chanting the first verse,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the whole of Deut. 6, <i>4</i>.</i> and the people say it after him in response.
[The <i>mafṭir</i>] then elevates the Torah scroll and says: ‘One is our God, great is our Lord, holy and revered is His name for ever and ever’.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reading of GRA.

<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">This is a continuation of the verses begun in Rule 8.</i> <i>‘Thy righteousness also, O God, reacheth unto high heaven; Thou Who hast done great things, O God, who is like unto Thee?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 71, 19.</i> <i>O Lord, Thy name endureth for ever; Thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> CXXXV, 13.</i> Let all ascribe strength to God and give honour to the Torah. <i>O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt His name together</i>.’<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid</i> XXXIV, 4.</i> The Torah scroll must be elevated at <i>Hear, O Israel</i>, at the threefold declaration of the unity of God, and at <i>O magnify the Lord with me</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">For the modern ritual, cf.

After that he elevates the Torah scroll and says: ‘One is our God, great is our Lord, holy and revered is His name for ever and ever’.

The scroll of the Torah is immediately unrolled a space of three columns and is elevated so as to show the face of the script to the people standing on the right and on the left. Then it is turned round towards the front and towards the rear; for it is a precept for all men and women to see the script,<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Before it is read. The ritual here described is followed by the Sefaradim. The Ashkenazim elevate the scroll after the conclusion of the reading (cf.

V has ‘to cover the heads’, which is obscure.</i> of those who are to be called to the reading, because it is not an honour for the Torah to be left alone.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘single’. It is therefore necessary for the <i>mafṭir</i>, the superintendent and one of the congregation who is to read a portion to accompany the scroll.</i> Similarly it is not proper for the precentor to stand alone before the reading-desk; so [two persons] should stand with him, one on his right and the other on his left, [the number] corresponding to that of the patriarchs.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">V inserts in parenthesis a ruling which seems displaced although it is included by GRA, M and H. It reads: ‘Some say that [the <i>mafṭir</i>] recites the <i>Shema‘</i> with the benediction “Who formest light” (P.B., p. 128) and “Holy” (p. 131) because of the benediction which he says “For the Torah, for the divine service”, etc. (pp. 149f)’.</i> The pure-minded men of Jerusalem acted in this manner: When the Torah scroll was taken out of the ark and when it was returned they followed it as a mark of respect.
A minor<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">The age is defined in Rule 17.</i> may read in the Torah and translate it, but he may not read the parts of the <i>Shema‘</i><sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. X, 7, p. 258 nn. 24ff.</i> by reciting ‘Who formest light’;<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">The first of the benedictions before the <i>Shema‘</i> (cf.

P.B., p. 238a).</i> A <i>poḥeaḥ</i>, that is one whose knees are exposed or whose clothes are torn, or one whose head is uncovered, may read the parts of the <i>Shema‘</i>. Others say that if a person’s knees [are exposed] or his clothes torn he may read the parts of the <i>Shema‘</i>, but one may not do so when his head is uncovered, since it is not permitted to utter the divine names [with uncovered head]. In either case he may translate, but not read in the Torah, nor stand before the reading-desk, nor lift up his hands.
A blind man may recite the parts of the <i>Shema‘</i> and translate. R. Judah said: One who has never seen the light may not read the parts of the <i>Shema‘</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Since it contains thanksgivings for the creation and enjoyment of light.</i>
The minor of whom the Rabbis spoke<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">In Rule 15.</i> is one who is under twelve years of age. A person who is above that age may read the parts of the <i>Shema‘</i>, but may not stand before the reading-desk nor lift up his hands<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V, M and H read: ‘and he who stands before the reading-desk and he who lifts up his hands’.</i> until he is twenty years of age and bearded. If he has no beard, although he is twenty years of age, he is forbidden to do so because<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V, M and H read ‘although’ for ‘he is … because’.</i> he looks like an eunuch. Others say that even an actual eunuch is permitted [to perform these acts]. If, however, a person has grown a beard even from the age of eighteen, he may stand before the reading-desk and lift up his hands.
As regards the scroll of Esther, all are qualified to read it except a deaf person, an imbecile and a minor. R. Judah declared a minor to be qualified. R. Levi said: The scroll of Esther must be read [on <i>Purim</i>] at night and repeated in the daytime, as it is stated, <i>So that my glory may sing praise to Thee</i>—i.e. by night, <i>and not be silent</i><sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 30, 13.</i>—i.e. by day. (Therefore it is customary to read it at the termination of the Sabbath of two [successive weeks].)<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">It is later explained that there was an ancient practice for the congregation to read the Book of Esther on the two Saturday evenings before <i>Purim</i>.</i> [41<i>a</i>] When R. Meir once passed by a Synagogue he heard the reading of<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘the voices’.</i> a section [of the scroll of Esther].<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">On a Saturday night.</i> ‘How long,’ he said to them, ‘will you be cutting up the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Which, in its wider sense, includes the Book of Esther.</i> into sections?’<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘making the Torah callings up, callings up’.</i> [‘We do it’], they replied, ‘on account of <i>my glory may sing praise unto Thee</i>’, and he allowed them [to continue the practice]. People have adopted the practice of reading it on two<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Inserted by GRA.</i> Saturday nights of <i>Adar</i> until fifteen days of the month have elapsed. In what manner is it read? At [the termination of] the first Sabbath of <i>Adar</i> the people read together up to <i>In that night</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Esth. 6, 1; half the book.</i> and on the next Saturday night they read from <i>In that night</i> up to <i>and speaking peace to all his seed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">To the end of the book.</i><br>In the case of the Song of Songs, it is read on the last [two] nights of the [Passover] Festival,<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">So one MS. quoted by M. V and others add ‘of the exile’, which cannot be justified since only the last day of Passover is a ‘Festival of the exile’.</i> half of it on the first night and the other half on the second night.<br>Ruth [is read] on the termination of the first day of Pentecost to [the end of] its [first] half, and concluded on the termination of the last day of the Festival. Others hold that with all the Festivals, we begin to read [the respective scrolls] on the Saturday night preceding them. People have also adopted the following procedure, viz. that no ruling is authoritatively laid down unless a custom<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">On which it is based.</i> had been definitely established.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V, M and H read: ‘unless it is a custom’.</i> As regards the saying of the Rabbis that ‘a custom cancels a ruling’,<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf. j.B.M. VII, 1, 11b.]</i> it applies to a custom of the pious men of old; but a custom which has no support from the Torah is only like an error of judgment.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘weighing of an opinion’.</i>
As we read [the weekly portion] from the Torah and the <i>hafṭarah</i> from the Prophet in daytime, so it is obligatory to read the scroll of Esther in daytime;<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">This is a repetition of R. Levi’s teaching quoted in the preceding paragraph, except that it is more specific. The word <i>welishnothah</i> (translated ‘repeated’) might be mistranslated as ‘the study of the Mishnah’ on the <i>Megillah</i>. The wording here precludes such a rendering.</i> as it is stated, <i>In the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Esth. 9, 1.</i> on which it was taught in the Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Meg. II, 5 (Sonc. ed., p. 124).</i> The whole of the day is a proper time for the reading of the scroll of Esther.
There is no difference between scrolls [of Scripture] and <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzoth</i> save that the scrolls,<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">The subject is continued in XV, 1.</i> etc. If a <i>tefillah</i> had worn out, no <i>mezuzah</i> may be made of it;<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>mezuzah</i> is deemed to be of a lesser degree of sanctity.</i> but if a <i>mezuzah</i> had worn out it may be made into <i>tefillin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">If the margins are still in a good condition and fit for the purpose.</i> because in sacred matters ascent to a higher degree of sanctity is allowed but not descent to a lesser degree.

Chapter 15

There is no difference between scrolls [of Scripture] and <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzoth</i> save that the scrolls may be written in any language,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For use in the Synagogue. Two such official translations are known: one in Aramaic, the Targum Onḳelos, and another in Greek made by Aquila under Rabbinic supervision.</i> whereas <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzoth</i> may only be written in the Assyrian script.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The Hebrew square characters are described as ‘Assyrian’ because they came into common use for religious writings after the return from the Babylonian exile (cf. Sanh. 21b, 22a, Sonc. ed., pp. 119ff and notes).</i> Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Even scrolls [of Scripture] were permitted by the Rabbis to be written only in Greek.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">[For the reason, cf. Meg. 9b (Sonc. ed., p. 50).]</i>
Although Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">An eminent authority.</i> said, ‘Even scrolls [of Scripture] were permitted by the Rabbis to be written only in Greek’, the Sages did not agree with him. For Rabbi related:<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Quoted in V, 15 (p. 236). The following statements in the name of Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel and the Sages respectively prove that both maintained their views.</i> It once happened that Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel was standing at the side of a building [in course of construction] on the Temple Mount, when a Targum of the book of Job was brought before him. He ordered the builder, ‘Bury it under the course of stones’. But the Sages also maintained their ruling, because we have learned in the Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Shab. XVI, 1 (Sonc. ed., p. 563).</i> All holy writings<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiographa.</i> may be saved from a fire<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">On the Sabbath by being removed from one domain to another, although this is not permitted with ordinary objects.</i> irrespective of whether they are used in public reading<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Such as the Prophets from which the <i>hafṭarah</i> is selected.</i> or not;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">viz. the Hagiographa.</i> and although they are written in any language, they must be stored away.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">When they are worn out and no longer fit for use. Sacred writings must never be destroyed.</i> And why do we not read [some of these scrolls]? On account of [possible] neglect of the House of Study.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">On the Sabbath when lectures are delivered in the Houses of Study. By engaging in the reading of the books mentioned the public would neglect the lectures.</i><br>The sheath of a scroll may be saved<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">From a fire on the Sabbath.</i> together with the scroll, and the <i>tefillin</i> bag together with the <i>tefillin</i>, although they contain money.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Which otherwise would not be permitted to be moved.</i> To what place may one rescue them? To a closed alley.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Where movement on the Sabbath is less restricted than in the public domain.</i> Ben Bathyra said: Even into an open alley.
Although the Sages have said that [some of] the Holy Writings may only be read from [the Sabbath] afternoon service onwards,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">When there are no public lectures in the Houses of Study (cf. Shab. 116b, Sonc. ed., p. 572).</i> yet they may be studied and expounded. If it is necesssary [to refer to] a word,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In Shab. <i>loc. cit.</i> the reading is ‘a verse’.</i> one may take a scroll and examine it. As regards secular documents, however, although they have ruled lines,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Like sacred scrolls, and one is less likely to forget the Sabbath and insert notes or corrections.</i> it is forbidden to read them [on the Sabbath].
Benedictions,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Such as those of the <i>‘Amidah</i> (P.B., pp. 44-53) and the like.</i> in which many passages of the Torah were quoted,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘written’.</i> must not be saved from a fire [on the Sabbath].<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">They do not possess the same degree of sanctity as the scrolls of Scripture.</i> Hence it was declared: They who write down benedictions are like those who burn the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Since these could not be saved if a fire broke out on the Sabbath.</i><br>It was related of a man who wrote benedictions that R. Ishmael went to examine him. As soon as he heard the sound of R. Ishmael’s steps, he seized a bundle of written sheets<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Containing benedictions and selections from the Torah.</i> and threw it into a bowl of water. In the following words [did R. Ishmael] address him, ‘The punishment for the latter act<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Destruction of the sheets containing sacred texts by water.</i> is greater than for the former’.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Writing benedictions which included passages from Scripture.</i>
Why did he<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">viz. R. Ishmael. So N.Y.; V reads ‘they’.</i> so address him? On account of the passages from the Torah which were quoted in them.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the benedictions; and could not, therefore, be saved from a fire on the Sabbath.</i><br>For<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The following reason has no connection with the beginning of Rule 5. It refers back to Rule 2 above which lays down that one must not read certain books of the Scripture during the hours when lectures are delivered in the Houses of Study (N.Y.).</i> R. Simeon b. Yoḥai taught: He who occupies himself with [only the study of] Scripture indulges in an indifferent practice;<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘a measure and no measure’.</i> with Mishnah it is a practice for which a reward is conferred; as for one who occupies himself with <i>Shas</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The Heb. letters <i>shin samek</i>, pronounced <i>Shas</i>, stand for <span dir="rtl">ששה סדרים</span> ‘the six orders’ of the Mishnah or of the combined Mishnah and Gemara. Here it evidently refers to the Gemara only. The corresponding passage in B.M. 33a (Sonc. ed., p. 206) reads ‘Gemara’. It has been suggested that the proper reading is ‘Talmud’ (cf. B.M. <i>loc. cit.</i>, n. 6).</i> there is no worthier practice, provided he had first studied Scripture and Mishnah.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">It is accordingly proved that the study of Mishnah and Gemara, which necessarily includes the Scriptures, is of far higher importance than of Scripture only.</i>
Always run to the Mishnah more than to the <i>Shas</i>. R. Jose b. Abin said: [The preceding Rule only applies to the time] before Rabbi had edited<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘sunk’, an unusual verb in such a connection. [Instead of <span dir="rtl">שקע</span>, H mentions a MS. variant <span dir="rtl">קבע</span> (fixed).]</i> the <i>Mishnayoth</i>, but now that Rabbi has edited the <i>Mishnayoth</i> run to the Mishnah more than to the <i>Shas</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">So N.Y. as required by the context. V, M and H read: ‘run to the <i>Shas</i> more than to the Mishnah.’</i>
[The Sages], however, said: Scripture has been compared to water, the Mishnah to wine, and the <i>Shas</i> to spiced-wine. The world cannot exist without water, it cannot exist without wine, and it cannot exist without spiced-wine; but a rich man enjoys all three of them. So, too, it is impossible for the world to exist without Scripture and without Mishnah, but it can never exist without the <i>Shas</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Which includes all.</i>
The Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The term here embraces the whole of the Scriptures.</i> has also been compared to salt, the Mishnah to pepper, and the <i>Shas</i> to spices. The world cannot exist without salt, without pepper and without spices; but the rich man enjoys all three. So, too, it is impossible for the world to exist without Scripture, without Mishnah and without the <i>Shas</i>.
Happy is the man whose labour is in [the study of] the <i>Shas</i>. Not that he should skip Scripture and the Mishnah and come [direct] to the <i>Shas;</i> but he should learn Scripture and Mishnah with the object of coming to the <i>Shas</i>. Of such a person it is stated, <i>The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, and as a high wall in his own conceit</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 18, 11.</i>
Abba Gurion of Ẓadian<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. Bethsaida in Galilee.</i> said in the name of Abba Guria:<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA in agreement with Ḳid. 82a (Sonc. ed., p. 423).

R. Nehorai said: I abandon all professions in the world and teach my son only Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Inserted by GRA in agreement with Ḳid. 82a (Sonc. ed., p. 423).</i> because a man enjoys part of its reward in this world while the principal remains intact for the world to come. The other professions, however, are not so. For should a person come to sickness, old age or suffering and is unable to carry on his work, he would die of starvation; whereas with the Torah it is not so, but it protects him from all evil in his youth and gives him a future and hope in his old age. What does it say in Scripture of his youth? <i>But they that wait for the Lord shall renew their strength</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Isa 40, 31.</i> And what does it say of his old age? <i>They shall still bring forth fruit in old age</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 92, 15. In Ḳid. <i>loc. cit.</i> the Mishnah adds: ‘And thus it is said of our father Abraham, <i>And Abraham was old … and the Lord blessed Abraham in all things</i> (Gen. 24, 1)’.</i>
R. Joshua b. Levi said: With regard to the <i>’aggadta</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">So M and H.

R. Nehemiah, in the name of R. Jacob b. Jannai, remarked on the text, <i>As in water face answereth to face:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 27, 19.</i> It is customary to have a master who desires to teach and a student who does not want to learn, or a student who desires to learn and a master who does not want to teach him; but in this case<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">viz. of God and Moses.</i> the Master desires to teach and the student to learn.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">V adds in parenthesis ‘Scripture and Mishnah, Gemara and <i>’aggadah’</i>.

R. Isaac Nappaḥa began his discourse as follows: <i>Stay me with dainties</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Cant. 2, 5, Heb. <span dir="rtl">באשישות</span>.</i> refers to the well-founded<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">מאוששות</span>, meaning ‘strong, firm’.</i> <i>halakoth; refresh me with apples</i> refers to the <i>’aggadoth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Inserted by GRA; not in V.

R. Tanḥum b. Ḥanilai said: If the Torah had been given as a clear-cut code,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘cut’.</i> no judge would have a <i>locus standi</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘standing of feet’, reading with M and H <span dir="rtl">עמידת</span> for <span dir="rtl">עומדות</span>.</i> in laying down a ruling;<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Since he could not use his discretion and reasoning power.</i> but now a judge has a <i>locus standi</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The clause ‘but … <i>standi’</i> is inserted by GRA.

R. Jannai said: The Torah which the Holy One, blessed be He, gave to Moses was delivered to him in forty-nine aspects of uncleanness and forty-nine aspects of cleanness,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. of prohibition and permissibility respectively.</i> as it is stated, <i>And his banner</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Cant. 2, 4, the continuation of the verse being <i>over me is love</i>. The verse is interpreted of the Torah, which is God’s <i>banner</i>, entrusted to Israel as a mark of His love.

R. Abahu said in the name of R. Joḥanan: R. ‘Aḳiba had a distinguished<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Or, ‘religiously scrupulous and meek’ (Rashi).</i> disciple who knew how to interpret the Torah in forty-nine aspects of uncleanness and forty-nine aspects of cleanness, not one reason being the same as another.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the note of GRA.</i> Consequently<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Since, according to R. ‘Aḳiba’s disciple and R.

It was related of R. Joḥanan b.

It was also related of him that he declared, ‘If all the heavens were sheets, all the trees quills and all the seas ink, they would not suffice for recording my wisdom which I acquired from my masters; and yet I have gained<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘set apart’.</i> no more of the wisdom of the Sages than a fly [acquires] which dips in the great sea and deprives it of the tiniest drop’.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf.

From whom did he<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai. Cf. for the eulogy, Suk. 28a (Sonc. ed., p. 123).</i> receive the Torah? From Hillel and Shammai. It was said of Hillel that he had not omitted to study any of the words of the Sages, even all languages, even the speech of mountains, hills and valleys, the speech of trees and herbs, the speech of wild beasts and cattle, the speech of demons<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">[For <i>shedim</i> (demons), H quotes a MS. variant <span dir="rtl">שירים</span> (songs).]</i> and parables.

R. Joshua b. Levi said: I have never looked into a book of <i>’aggadta</i> except once when I looked and found written therein that the one hundred and seventy-five sections of the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the Pentateuch.</i> in which occurs any expression of speaking, saying or commanding, correspond to the number of years of our father Abraham;<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham lived 175 years (Gen. 25, 7).</i> for it is written, <i>Thou hast ascended on high, Thou hast led captivity captive; Thou hast received gifts</i><sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Explained as the Torah given to Moses as a gift from God.</i> <i>for the sake of the man</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">viz.

<i>The words of the wise are as goads … they are given from one shepherd;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Eccles. 12, 11.</i> and one Shepherd<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">[i.e. God; cf.

In what manner are the interruptions made if the New Moon or the days of <i>Ḥanukkah</i> fall on a Sabbath?

Our Rabbis in the land of Israel had the custom of fasting after <i>Purim</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Not, as others, before it.</i> on account of [the victory over] Nicanor and his associates,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This occurred on the thirteenth of Adar, the day before <i>Purim</i> [cf. 1 Macc.

Nicanor was a Syrian commander who fell in the Maccabean war in the battle of Adasa in 161 <small>b.c.e.</small></i> and also because the commemoration of sad events is postponed rather than antedated.
[What was the procedure in the case of] <i>ma‘amadoth?</i> As it was taught:<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf.

The Sages, however, said: In the period of the <i>ma‘amadoth</i> they were not concerned with the hatred of the Christians, but the reason is that it is written <i>He ceased from work wayyinnafash</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 31, 17, E.V., <i>and rested</i>.</i> [which is homiletically interpreted] <i>wai ‘al nefesh</i>, ‘Woe for [the loss of the additional] soul’.

On Mondays and Thursdays and at the Sabbath afternoon service the regular portion of the week is read, and this is not reckoned as a part of the reading [for the succeeding Sabbath].<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">When it must be repeated.</i> [The reason<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">For the various readings prescribed above.</i> is] because it is stated, <i>And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Lord</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 23, 44.</i> which implies that it is an ordinance that each [appointed section] shall be read in its season.

Chapter 18

Why has it been ordained that the psalms<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">So H while M has the singular; it is lacking in V.</i> [prescribed for the Temple service] are to be said<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">At the present time when no sacrifices are offered.</i> on every New Moon?<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">As in Temple times when they were recited while the continual sacrifice was being offered.</i> [This is done in accordance with the view of] R. Simeon b. Laḳish. He enquired of R. Joḥanan whether it was permissible to recite the psalms<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘song’.</i> in the absence of libations, and he replied, ‘We may deduce the answer from the following statement: On this and that [occasion]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The destruction of the first and second Temples.</i> the Levites stood on the platform<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">On the Sunday immediately following the respective destructions (‘Arak. 11b, Sonc. ed., p. 65).</i> and recited, <i>And He hath brought upon them their own iniquity</i>’.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 94, 23. As this Psalm was prescribed normally for Wednesdays (in connection with the sacrifices and libations of the day) but was said on these two occasions on the Sunday (for which a different Psalm had been arranged), it follows that the recital of a particular Psalm is independent of the sacrifices or libations of the day. It was ordained, therefore, that the Psalm for the New Moon, originally prescribed for the Temple service, should also be said at the present time (cf. N.Y.).</i> R. Simeon b. Laḳish asked him, ‘Which is first, the psalm<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Which was said in connection with the morning continual offering.</i> or the additional sacrifice?’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Of the New Moon, if the Psalm had been delayed until the time of the additional sacrifice had arrived.</i> He replied,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Inserted by GRA.</i> ‘It is obvious that the psalm is read first’.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Since it belongs to the earlier part of the service.</i> For this reason<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Because of the ruling above that the Temple Psalm of the New Moon should continue to be said even at the present time.</i> the people have adopted the custom of saying psalms<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">As in the Temple, although no sacrifices are now offered.</i> at their proper times;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">As prescribed for the Temple service.</i> as we have learned in the Mishnah:<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Tamid VII, 4 (Sonc. ed., pp. 37f).</i> ‘These were the psalms which the Levites used to recite in the Temple: On Sunday<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘the first day’.

On <i>Ḥanukkah</i> [the psalm is] <i>I will extol Thee, O Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 30.</i> On <i>Purim</i> it is <i>Shiggaion of David</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 7.</i> but others say it is <i>O God, keep not Thou silence</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 83.

On the Feast of Weeks<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Pentecost.</i> [the psalm is] <i>Ascribe unto the Lord, O ye sons of might</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 29.</i> On the ninth day of <i>Ab</i> [the reading consists] of four verses of Jeremiah, <i>Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah?</i> to <i>For Thou hast made all these things</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Jer. 14, 19-22.</i> and the following two psalms, <i>O God, the heathen are come into Thine inheritance</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 79.</i> and <i>By the rivers of Babylon</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 137.</i> Although it is usual<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘in every place’.</i> to give precedence to the Holy Words<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘words of holiness’, the Hagiographa.</i> over the words of [prophetical] traditions,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Prophets forming the second division of the Scriptures.</i> in this case the latter<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Jeremiah, although it is included in the Prophets.</i> takes precedence over the former.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">The Psalms, which are included in the Hagiographa.</i>
Some [congregations] read the Book of Lamentations in the evening<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Of the Ninth of <i>Ab.</i></i> while others postpone it to the [following] morning after the reading of the Torah, when the reader<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">GRA.</i> stands up, his head covered with ashes, his clothes torn,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Like a mourner, the mourning being for the destruction of the Temples.</i> and reads it with weeping and lamentation. If he is able to translate it, well and good; but if he is unable he entrusts it to one who knows how to translate properly and [that person] does the translation, so that the rest of the people, the women and children may understand it; in that women are obliged to listen to the reading of the Book, how much more so does it apply to men.<br>Women have similarly the duty to read the <i>Shema‘</i>, the [<i>‘Amidah</i>] prayer and the Grace after meals, and to have a <i>mezuzah</i> [on their doors]. But if they are not acquainted with the holy tongue they are to be taught [to say them] in any language which they can understand and master. From this it was deduced that the man who recites the benedictions<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">In his home.</i> must raise his voice for the benefit of his young sons, his wife and daughters. It is, therefore, a logical deduction that every section of the Torah and the Prophet [prescribed for the readings] of the Sabbath should be translated for the people, the women and the children after the reading of the Torah. This is why it was ruled: On the Sabbath the people come [to the Synagogue] early and depart late. They come early to read the <i>Shema‘</i>, like the pious men of old, with the first glimpse of the sun; and they depart late to listen to the interpretation of the weekly section. On a Festival, however, they come late, because they have to prepare the food for the day;<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Which is permitted on a Festival when not the Sabbath.</i> and they hasten to depart because it is unreasonable to interpret [the Torah or the Prophet] for them, it having been stated: Rab did not appoint an interpreter from [the beginning of the first day of] the Festival to the conclusion of the second day.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘its companion’. Rab’s reason was that, owing to the legitimate indulgence on the Festival days, his mind might not be clear to impart the proper instruction or to give the necessary guidance to the public through the interpreter. Similarly it is implied that, in order to enable the people to enjoy the festivities of the day, they are given the opportunity of departing at an earlier hour.</i>
There was likewise a beautiful custom in Jerusalem to train<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Inserted by GRA, M and H.</i> their young sons and daughters to afflict themselves on a fast day:<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Although the duty of fasting the whole day did not apply to them.</i> at the age of eleven to the middle of the day, at the age of twelve the full day, and at the age of thirteen [the boy] was taken round<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V, M and H read ‘and after that he carried him’.</i> and presented to every elder to bless him and pray for him that he may be worthy to study the Torah and engage in good deeds. In like manner,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">This is an insertion of GRA, omitted in V, M and H.</i> everyone who had a man superior to him in the town would rise from his place and go and bow down to him [requesting] that he pray on his behalf. This is meant to teach us that they<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">The men of Jerusalem.</i> were splendid men and their deeds were splendid, and that their hearts [were directed] towards Heaven. Furthermore, they did not leave their young children behind but took them to the Synagogue to encourage them in the performance of the precepts.
On the day when R. Eleazar b. ‘Azariah was appointed head of the academy, he began his discourse by saying: <i>Ye are standing this day all of you … your little ones, your wives</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 29, 9f.</i> the men came to listen, the women came to receive a reward for their journey,<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘steps’. Even if the women did not understand the discourse, they were entitled to reward for their attendance and bringing their children with them. The corresponding passage in Ḥag. 3a (Sonc. ed., p. 9) reads ‘men came to learn, women came to listen’.</i> but why did the little ones come? That a reward may be given to those who bring them. From this the young daughters of Israel learnt the practice of coming to the Synagogue so that a reward may be granted to those who bring them while they would [in due course]<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">When they reach womanhood.</i> also receive their reward.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">As the result of their early training and practice. In childhood one is subject neither to reward nor punishment.</i>
<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">This is the continuation of Rule 4 above.</i> The reader on the Ninth of <i>Ab</i><sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Inserted by M and H, omitted in V.</i> says,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">Before the reading of the Book of Lamentations, or before the reading of the section of the Torah.</i> ‘Blessed … the true Judge’.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. P.B., p. 292. This blessing is said on a calamity or hearing bad news.</i> Some place the Torah scroll<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">M reads ‘the case of the Torah’.</i> on the ground in a black wrapping and say, <i>The crown is fallen from our head</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Lam. 5, 16.</i> The reading and the lamentations are carried out as with a man whose dead lies before him. Some change their [customary] places [in the Synagogue]; others descend from their benches, and all of them roll in ashes and do not greet one another throughout the night and also throughout the day until the people have finished their lamentations. During the recital of the lamentations it is forbidden to speak [any irrelevant] word, or to go outside [the Synagogue], lest one’s mind be diverted from the mourning; and it is obvious that no conversation with a Gentile is permitted.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Since the conversation would have no relevance to the destruction of the Temples.</i>
In the evening service<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">On the ninth of <i>Ab.</i></i> no one can hear the other, because all pray in a whisper;<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">As a mark of mourning for the destruction.</i> therefore we say neither ‘Bless ye’<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">‘Bless ye the Lord Who is to be blessed’ which is addressed to the congregation at the beginning of the evening service (cf. P.B., p. 96).</i> nor ‘[Blessed] be the name’.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Which was exclaimed before ‘Bless ye’ but is not now said.</i>

Chapter 19

In the morning service,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Of the ninth of <i>Ab</i>, the services of which were treated in the previous chapter.</i> however,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The contrast is with the ruling in XVIII, 8 where it was stated that in the evening service ‘Bless ye’ is not said.</i> after the psalms and the Scriptural verses, [the reader] in the <i>Yoẓer</i> benediction<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

In the afternoon prayer, however, both ‘Holy’<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">P.B., p. 94<small>C</small>.</i> and <i>ḳaddish</i> are said.
<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">This and the following Rule continue the interrupted regulations on the selection of psalms for various occasions begun in XVIII, 2f.</i> And on the New Year we say, <i>O clap your hands, all ye peoples;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 47.</i> on the Day of Atonement <i>Bless the Lord, O my soul</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 104.</i> and <i>Out of the depths have I called Thee, O Lord;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 130.</i> on the Festival of Tabernacles <i>In Judah is God known;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 76.</i> on the Eighth Day [of Solemn Assembly] <i>For the Leader … on the Sheminith</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 6.</i> If one is not conversant with these psalms, he says I <i>will give thanks unto the Lord with my whole heart</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 9.</i> and that suffices.

On the Day of Atonement no mention is made<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In the <i>‘Amidah</i>.</i> of ‘on the Festival Day’, because there is no Festival on a fast day; but one says, ‘On this day of holy convocation, on this day of the Fast of the Tenth,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The Day of Atonement is observed on the tenth of <i>Tishri</i>.</i> on this day of pardoning of iniquity’, concluding with<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

Then one says three times, ‘An auspicious omen, an auspicious omen, shall it be for all Israel. Blessed be He Who formed thee, blessed be Thy Maker, blessed be thy Possessor, blessed be thy Creator’. Turning in the direction of the moon,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘towards it’.</i> he jumps three times and exclaims three times, ‘As I jump towards thee but do not<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">M reads ‘and cannot’ which is the reading in the ritual.</i> touch thee, so if others should jump against me to hurt me may they not touch me. Let terror and dread fall upon them and may this be retrospective, Amen, Amen, Selah. Praise ye the Lord’. He then says ‘Peace’ three times to his fellow and goes home with a cheerful heart. That is [the conclusion of the regulations] concerning the interruptions for New Moons.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. XVII, 2f where the regulations for the New Moon began and, with many interruptions, insertions and amplifications, continued to the end of this Rule.</i>
What are the regulations respecting <i>Ḥanukkah?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘how do we interrupt for <i>Ḥanukkah</i>’, a reference to XVII, 2 where <i>Ḥanukkah</i> was first introduced in this set of regulations with the statement, ‘The sequence … is interrupted for … <i>Ḥanukkah’</i>.</i> The Rabbis said: On the twenty-fifth day of <i>Kislew</i><sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The ninth Heb. month on the twenty-fifth of which the Festival begins.</i> the <i>Ḥanukkah</i> lamp is kindled,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This takes place on the preceding evening, the night belonging to the following day.</i> and it is forbidden to use an old lamp;<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">If it is an earthen lamp, because the burnt oil renders it unsightly.</i> but if a person has only an old lamp, he must thoroughly heat it in fire;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">To burn away the old oil, after which the lamp may be used.</i> nor may [the <i>Ḥanukkah</i> lamp] be moved<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘lifted’.</i> from its place before it is extinguished.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Carrying the lamp about while it is burning might cause suspicion that one is making a profane use of it; but the <i>Ḥanukkah</i> light, commemorating the miracles which led up to the celebration (cf. Rule 5), is sacred, is only to be looked at and must not be used for any other purpose.</i>
The commandment to kindle it extends from sunset until the last person has left<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘the foot ceases from’.</i> the street.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The light is intended to serve as a public demonstration, but at such a late hour there are no passers-by to see it.</i> And, although there is no actual proof,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">That the lighting must take place after sunset.</i> there is an allusion to it: <i>The pillar of cloud by day</i> [<i>and the pillar of fire by night</i>,] <i>departed not</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 13, 22, which indicates that the pillar of fire which, like the <i>Ḥanukkah</i> lamp, was intended to shed light, appeared in the night only</i> If it was lit in daytime, one must derive no benefit from it, nor may the benediction be said over it; for so [the Rabbis] said: No benediction is to be pronounced over the lamp before one enjoys its light. There is no need, however, to be concerned about changing the wick before it has been used up.
It is a religious precept to place the <i>Ḥanukkah</i> lamp by the door which is near to the public domain,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">So that the light is seen from the street.</i> in such a manner that the <i>mezuzah</i> should be on the right hand and the <i>Ḥanukkah</i> lamp on the left, to fulfil what is stated, <i>How fair and how pleasant art thou</i><sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Cant. 7, 7.</i>—<i>how fair</i> with the <i>mezuzah</i> and <i>how pleasant</i> with the <i>Ḥanukkah</i> lamp. The number<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Inserted by GRA, wanting in V, M and H.</i> of lights [for each night] is in accordance with the ruling of the School of Hillel,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">One light on the first night, two on the second, and so on, until eight lights burn on the eighth and last night of the Festival.</i> because in sacred matters one should proceed to a higher grade<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Adding lights on the succeeding nights.</i> but not descend to a lower one,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">As would happen if the number were to be reduced from eight on the first night to one on the last in accordance with the view of Beth Shammai.</i> [and also because the number of lights should] correspond to the days [of the Festival] as they pass.
In what manner are the benedictions<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Over the <i>Ḥanukkah</i> lights.</i> said? On the first day, the person who kindles [the lamp] says three benedictions while the onlooker says two. The person who kindles says, ‘Blessed art Thou, O Lord,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Inserting after ‘Lord’, as in all benedictions, ‘our God, King of the universe’ (P.B., p. 274).</i> Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments and hast given us command to kindle the light of <i>Ḥanukkah</i>’. Then<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">After the three benedictions: the one just given and the two mentioned below.</i> he says, ‘We kindle these lights on account of the deliverances and the miracles and the wonders which Thou didst work for our fathers, by means of Thy holy priests.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The Maccabees who were a priestly family.</i> During all the eight days of <i>Ḥanukkah</i> these lights are sacred, and it is not permitted to make any profane use of them but we are only to look at them, in order that we may give thanks unto Thy name for thy wonders, Thy miracles and Thy deliverances’. [The third benediction is] ‘Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who hast kept us in life’.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Concluding ‘and hast preserved us, and enabled us to reach this season’ (P.B., p. 274).</i> [Before this] he says, ‘Who wroughtest miracles for our fathers’.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Beginning, as usual, ‘Blessed art … universe’ and concluding ‘in the days of old at this season’ (P.B., p. 274).</i> These benedictions are for the person who kindles the lights, but the onlooker says on the first day only two benedictions: ‘Who hast kept us in life’ and ‘Who wroughtest miracles’. From that day onwards the person who kindles the lights says, ‘To kindle’ and ‘Who wroughtest’, while the onlooker only says ‘Who wroughtest miracles’.
The precentor must say, ‘Thou art holy’<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the <i>ḳedushshah</i>. It appears that, instead of beginning with ‘We will sanctify’ (P.B., p. 45) or ‘We will reverence’ (P.B., p. 160), there was a custom to begin with ‘Thou art holy’ on Sabbath and Festivals. Rule 7 extends this practice to some of the less important days as specified below. It has also been suggested to read, instead of <i>’attah ḳadosh</i> (‘Thou art holy’) <i>’eth haḳḳedushshah</i> (‘the <i>ḳedushshah</i>’).</i> on the eight days<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA.

And R. Hiyya learnt: On any day on which there is a musaf <i>ḳedushshah</i> is said except on <i>Ḥanukkah</i> on which <i>ḳedushshah</i> is said although there is no <i>musaf</i> on it, because <i>Hallel</i> is included [in the service]. Some maintain [that it is said] on <i>Purim</i> also, because the scroll of Esther is read on it.
In the benediction for Thanksgiving<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Beginning ‘We give thanks’ (P.B., p. 51).</i> we include [on <i>Ḥanukkah</i>] ‘and thanks for the wonders and salvation of Thy priests which Thou hast wrought in the days of Mattathias, son of Joḥanan, High Priest, and the Hasmoneans his sons.

[Reverting to the sequence of the readings which] is interrupted for <i>Purim</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. XVII, 2 where the subject was begun.

And why do we not fast in the month of <i>Nisan?</i> Because on the first of <i>Nisan</i> the Tabernacle was erected<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

The Passover ending on the twenty-first (in the land of Israel) or on the twenty-second (in the Diaspora), only eight or nine days of the month remain. As by far the greater part of the month was made up of festival days, the entire month is treated as a festival season in which fasting is prohibited.</i> Furthermore, in the time to come the Sanctuary will be rebuilt in <i>Nisan</i>, to confirm what is stated, <i>There is nothing new under the sun</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 1, 9.</i>

The only exception is [the fast of] the firstborn who fast on the eve of Passover.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">In thanksgiving for the deliverance of the Israelite firstborn on Passover eve when Egypt’s firstborn perished (Ex. 12, 29).</i> The very pious also fast on that day on account of the unleavened bread, in order that they shall begin to eat it<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">On the evening preceding the fifteenth of <i>Nisan</i>.
