Tractate Derekh Eretz Zuta





Chapter 1

The characteristics of a scholar are that he is meek, humble,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Aboth IV, 4 (Sonc. ed., p. 45).</i> alert, filled [with a desire for learning],<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">H reads <i>memullaḥ</i>, ‘bright’, as in Ḳid. 29b (Sonc. ed., p. 141). Cf. KR III, 2, p. 443, n. 13.</i> modest, beloved by all, humble to the members of his household and sin-fearing. He judges a man [fairly] according to his deeds,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">He does not, e.g., interpret a man’s good actions as determined by ulterior motives and does not show favour where it is not deserved.</i> and says ‘I have no desire for all the things of this world because this world is not for me’. He sits and studies,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">H omits ‘and studies’.</i> soiling his cloak at the feet of the scholars.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For <i>meṭannef</i> H reads <i>mith‘aṭṭef</i>, ‘wrapped in his cloak’, perhaps in the same sense as in Aboth I, 4 (Sonc. ed., p. 3), ‘Suffer thyself to be covered by the dust of their feet’, i.e. sit in the dust on the ground at their feet while they teach. GRA reads <i>maṭṭil</i>, ‘and throws his cloak in front of the feet of scholars’, perhaps for them to sit on. For a different explanation, cf. KR III, p. 444, n. 17.</i> In him no one sees any evil. He questions according to the subject-matter<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Shab. 3b (Sonc. ed., pp. 5f.), ‘R. Ḥiyya said to Rab: “When Rabbi is occupied with one tractate, do not ask him a question relating to another” ’.</i> and answers to the point.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘in accordance with the accepted decision’.</i>
Be like a gourd split open that the wind may enter,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Let your mind be open to receive instruction. For readings which add the negative, cf. ARN p. 85 and KR p. 449.</i> like a deep furrow which retains its water,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Such a bed yields good produce; so must a scholar study continuously and raise good disciples.</i> like a jar coated with pitch which preserves its wine,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. he must have a retentive memory.</i> and like a sponge which absorbs all.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Aboth V, 18 (Sonc. ed., V, 15, p. 69).</i><br>Be not like a wide opening which allows the wind to rush in,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. do not cultivate associates indiscriminately, yet do not be so unapproachable that worthy companionships cannot get near to you. Or, do not create a stir on entering and leaving; or, do not allow petty and frivolous ideas to enter your mind.</i> or like a narrow opening which injures the valuable [as they press through].<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">By having to stoop or squeeze in; i.e. do not cause people worthy or your association to demean themselves or hold aloof.</i> Be like a doorstep on which everyone treads<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. be ready to learn from all.</i> and like a low peg which is within the reach of all.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘on which all hang [their things]’.</i>
If you suffered monetary loss, remember Job who was smitten both financially and physically. If you have been smitten physically, remember Dathan and Abiram who descended alive into Sheol.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Num. 16, 32f.</i>
Do not be enticed into sin by your eyes, because enticement into sin is caused only through the eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Soṭah 8a (Sonc. ed., p. 35), ‘We have learnt a tradition that the evil impulse only bears sway over what a person’s eyes see’.</i>
Do not cause yourself to feel ashamed by your teeth<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">GRA reads: ‘Do not be attracted to appetizing dishes’.</i> lest you eat more than is good for you.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘more than is sufficient’. NY quotes a reading: ‘That you do not give them too much to eat’. Another and better variant is: ‘That you eat not’, etc., i.e. <i>shello’</i> instead of <i>shemma’</i>.</i>
Do not turn away from meritorious deeds and do not be attracted to heresy.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <i>minuth</i>, a term for the teachings of the early Jewish-Christians.</i> Do not inquire of Sadducees<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">A party holding views antagonistic to those of the Pharisees. They regarded only those observances obligatory which are in the written Torah and did not acknowledge what was derived by Rabbinical interpretation.</i> lest you be drawn into Gehinnom.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">By abandoning the Torah.</i>
If others speak evil of you, answer them not; should it be a serious [calumny], regard it as slight. If, however, you spoke evil of others, though [the calumny] be slight, regard it as serious [and do not rest] until you go and pacify them.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">On the evil of slander, cf. ‘Arak. 15b (Sonc. ed., pp. 86ff.).</i>
Let not your [behaviour during] adolescence be of blemished repute, for this would be derogatory to the Torah; but let it be of unblemished repute, for this would tend to glorify the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">The translation follows GRA.</i>
Love and honour the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">By carrying out your duties towards God.</i> Love your fellow-creatures and respect them.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">By observing your duties towards them.</i>
Set aside your will in face of the will of your fellow,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">When they conflict; cf. Aboth II, 4 (Sonc. ed., p. 14).</i> for so did Rachel towards Leah and David towards Saul.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. KR IV, p. 454f.</i> Set aside your will and the will of your fellow in face of the will of Heaven, for so we find it with Jacob who did not kiss Joseph.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>ibid.</i></i>
Love the [term] ‘perhaps’ and hate the [expression] ‘how much?’<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. ‘how much harm will it do to me?’ Or, be envious of others by saying, ‘Look how much So-and-so possesses!’</i> R. Ḥidḳa expressed this in another way: Love the [term] ‘perhaps’ and hate the [expression] ‘what of it?’<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">If I commit this trivial sin; so GRA, lit. ‘What is in it?’ it is of little consequence.</i>
Keep aloof from anything that may lead to sin, from anything hideous and from whatever seems hideous,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ḥul. 44b (Sonc. ed., p. 239).</i> lest others suspect you of sin.
Slander not your fellow because there is no remedy for him who slanders his fellow.
Do not eat bread with a <i>kohen</i> who is an <i>‘am ha-’areẓ</i> lest he give you sacred food to eat.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ned. 20a (Sonc. ed., p. 56).</i>
Refrain from grumbling lest you grumble against others and be led into further sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. below, IX, 1, p. 589.</i>
There were seven patriarchs with whom a divine covenant was made, viz.: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Phinehas and David. In connection with Abraham it is written, <i>In that day the Lord made a covenant with Abraham saying</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 15, 18.</i> In connection with Isaac it is written, <i>But My covenant will I establish with Isaac</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XVII, 21.</i> In connection with Jacob it is written, <i>Then will I remember My covenant with Jacob</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 26, 42.</i> In connection with Moses it is written, <i>For after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 34, 27.</i> In connection with Aaron it is written, <i>It is an everlasting covenant of salt before the Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 18, 19.</i> In connection with Phinehas it is written, <i>And it shall be unto him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XXV, 13.</i> In connection with David it is written, <i>I have made a covenant with My chosen, I have sworn unto David My servant</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 89, 4. Perhaps this passage is quoted here to teach men to emulate their special characteristics. Abraham stands as the example of hospitality, Isaac of self-sacrifice, Jacob of scholarship (cf. Gen. 25, 27, where according to Rabbinic interpretation <i>tents</i> means schools), Moses of meekness, Aaron of peace-making, Phinehas of zeal on behalf of God, and David of singing His praise.</i>
The following seven patriarchs have gone to their eternal rest with great honour and worms and maggots had no dominion over them, viz.: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Miriam and their father Amram.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">In B.B. 17a (Sonc. ed., p. 86), ‘and Benjamin the son of Jacob’.</i> Some say: Also David, as it is stated, <i>Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth; my flesh also dwelleth in safety</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 16, 9, the last words being understood as ‘unaffected by worms’.</i>
There were nine<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">For the list, cf. KR III, p. 461, and notes</i> who entered the Garden of Eden alive, viz.: Enoch the son of Yered, Elijah, the Messiah, Eliezer the servant of Abraham, Hiram, king of Tyre,<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">It is more likely that the word <i>king</i> has crept in by mistake and the text should read ‘Hiram of Tyre’, who was of the tribe of Naphtali (1 Kings 7, 13f.).</i> Ebed-melech the Cushite, Jabeẓ the son of R. Judah the Prince, Bithiah the daughter of Pharaoh, and Seraḥ the daughter of Asher. Some say: Also R. Joshua b. Levi.

Chapter 2

Let all your undertakings be for the name of Heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Having a sincere and high purpose. ‘Heaven’ is a term for God.</i> Love Heaven and fear Heaven. Hurry to perform in gladness all the precepts.
Sit before the Elders and incline your ear to hear their words. Listen carefully to the words of your fellow; be not hasty to answer but give proper thought to your words. Speak of the first [point] first and of the last [point] last, and admit the truth. Speak not before him who is greater than you in wisdom.
If you desire to study,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">H adds ‘the Torah’.</i> do not say regarding what you do not understand, ‘I understand’.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">GRA reads: ‘and if he desires to teach [you a certain subject], do not say, “I have heard it” ’.</i> If you are questioned on [even] a trivial matter and you are not acquainted with it, be not ashamed to say, ‘I do not know’. If you were taught something which you did not grasp, be not ashamed to say [to the teacher], ‘Repeat it to me’ and do not pretend to yourself ‘I understood it’.
Do [good] deeds for the sake of their Maker<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. God, Who decreed them (so RN to Ned. 62a); but Baḥya ibn Paḳuda, in the Introduction to his <i>Duties of the Heart</i>, interprets, ‘for the performance of them’, i.e. doing good for its own sake and not from an interested motive.</i> and speak of them<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">viz. words of Torah.</i> for their own sake.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. do not study in order to be called a Sage or Rabbi; cf. Ned. 62a (Sonc. ed., p. 197). So according to the emended text of GRA.</i> Make not of them a crown wherewith to adorn yourself, an axe with which to chop or a spade with which to dig.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Aboth IV, 7 (Sonc. ed., IV, 5, p. 46).</i> Undertake to study the Torah [even] in straitened circumstances and disregard any insult. A well-ordered [moral] stock-taking and a virtuous adolescence [yield] security and truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">GRA’s emendation may mean: ‘and your security will be real’, or, ‘your promise [which you give] will be true’. An alternative rendering of V may be: ‘[If your deeds] are well considered, and you have good breeding, your promise will be trustworthy’. Cf. the reading in KR IV, 7, p. 466.</i>
Love and honour the Torah; love righteous ways, reproofs<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Levelled at you. Cf. <i>Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee</i> (Prov. 9, 8).</i> and uprightness. Do not run after honour; do not be presumptuous in giving decisions.<br>Realize that from now until tomorrow everything you have, whether it belongs to you or not, is not yours;<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">‘Is not yours’ is added by GRA.</i> because what is yours is [in reality] not yours, so how can what is not yours be yours! Of him who regards what is not his as his own, Scripture declares, <i>Woe to him that increaseth that which is not his! How long? and that ladeth himself with many pledges!</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Hab. 2, 6.</i> Accustom yourself to end on an auspicious note.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. if you must criticize or predict misfortune, your last words should inspire confidence and comfort. Or, ‘accustom yourself to finish anything good which you began to do’, otherwise it will be credited to him who completes it. Other possible interpretations are: ‘Accustom yourself to complete a deal with goodness’, i.e. there should be no cause for resentment by the other party; ‘Accustom yourself to end everything well’.</i> 
Be modest and amiable towards all, and be humble and gentle of speech. Be quick [to render service] to a superior and easy of approach to a suppliant [for your service].<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. DER II, p. 540, n. 41.</i> [Be like] a good merchant<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Who can distinguish between the genuine and the spurious; so know how to react towards different types of persons.</i> and broad-shouldered.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. able to deal with all types. H reads <i>reḥab kesef</i>, ‘liberal with money’. Another interpretation is: ‘Be like a good merchant (i.e. well stocked with goods so that a customer need not be kept waiting while the required article is brought from outside), and like a carrier who can carry a big load easily’. The meaning may then be: Be well stocked and carry a heavy load of learning, so that you are ready to supply knowledge to an inquirer.</i>
Keep aloof from anything which may bring you to sin. Recoil from [even] a minor sin that it may not lead you to a major sin. Hasten to [perform] a light precept<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ps. 119, 60. One is more liable to be slack and procrastinating with an easy task and so forget it; to obviate this a man should hasten to perform it as soon as it presents itself.</i> and flee<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Not merely avoid, but put as long a distance as possible between yourself and transgression.</i> from even] a trivial transgression lest it will lead you to commit a grave transgression.
Let the honour of your fellow be as dear to you as your own.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Aboth II, 15 (Sonc. ed., II, 10, p. 20).</i> Show respect to all persons; say not, ‘I will flatter this man that he may give me to eat, or that he may give me to drink, or another man that he may clothe me, or yet another that he may give me shelter’.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Beẓah 32b (Sonc. ed., p. 165): ‘He who is dependent on another’s table, the world is dark for him and his life is no life’.</i><br>It is better that you be ashamed of yourself<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. be the first to recognize your faults and rectify them.</i> than be put to shame by others.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sanh. 42a (Sonc. ed., p. 274).</i> Let not your teeth bring shame upon you,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. by spending more than you can afford on food so that you become reduced in circumstances.</i> nor your mouth bring you to abuse.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">By drinking more than is good for you.</i> Let not your tongue [cause others to] curse you or your lips discredit you, and do not bow down to your words.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Do not speak in haste without premeditation so that you will not have to humble yourself by asking pardon or having to retract. Other possible interpretations are: Do not regard your words as dogmatic; or, do not be self-opinionated; or, do not be a slave to your words, i.e. refrain from making a promise. H reads <i>tishtaḥ</i>, ‘do not spread your words’, i.e. do not be verbose.</i>
If you desire to secure your fellow’s love, concern yourself with his welfare. If you want to keep away from sin, go, reflect and consider its consequences well. Take delight in the performance of a <i>miẓwah</i>, study hard and exult in [carrying it out] in all its details.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA who conjectures <i>bifraṭeha</i>, but there is no MS. confirmation for it. A suggested reading is, <i>shekan urebaẓ biftaḥeha</i>, ‘Dwell and couch at the doors of [the Academy]’; i.e. by constant study make yourself familiar with the <i>miẓwoth</i>.</i>
If you did [someone] a great favour regard it as small, and do not say, ‘I did this good act with my own [money]’. Rather was it [from what God] had graciously given you and you should offer thanks to Heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">For the means with which to do good.</i> If others have done you a slight favour regard it as if it were great, and do not say, ‘The favour was done to me because of my worthy acts’, but [say, ‘In spite of] my unworthy acts a favour was done to me’, as it is stated, <i>And repayeth them that hate Him to their face, to destroy them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 7, 10. It is better not to receive the reward in this world but to store it up for the hereafter</i><br>If you wronged someone slightly regard it as a great wrong and exclaim, ‘Woe is me, for I have sinned! Woe is me, because harm was done through me!’ If others did you a great wrong regard it as small and exclaim, ‘I suffered slightly; I deserved more’.

Chapter 3

Reflect before [the word] issues from your mouth. Consider your actions in accordance with good manners. Set a reward for every step you take.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. see that your steps are directed to perform deeds which deserve a reward.</i> Submit to [divine] judgment and refrain from grumbling. 
Judge your fellow in the scale of merit<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Seek a favourable interpretation of his actions even though they seem suspicious. Cf. Aboth I, 6 (Sonc. ed., p. 5).</i> and do not turn the scale against him.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Take a charitable view of his deeds.</i> Rejoice in your lot and enjoy the little you have. Hate not him who reproves you. Your lot will always be blessed if you possess a bountiful eye<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Well disposed, generous; cf. Prov. 22, 9.</i> and a contented soul.
Accustom your tongue to say, ‘I do not know’, lest you be led to falsehood and be apprehended.
If you are negligent in [the performance of] one precept you will eventually be negligent with another like it. If you belittle<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘speak lightly of’.</i> one precept you will eventually belittle others like it.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">V adds in brackets ‘and you have done nothing for your trouble’ in fulfilling the precepts since you regard them of small worth.</i> If you transgress the words of the Torah intentionally, you will be made to transgress them intentionally or unintentionally.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Circumstances will make it impossible for you to perform the precepts even if you are desirous of making good former lapses.</i> [58<i>b</i>] If you take for yourself anything which is not yours, what is yours will be taken from you.
Be careful with consecrated objects both when giving them<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">To the <i>kohen</i> or Levite; do not withhold them.</i> and when eating them.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">They must be eaten in a state of ritual cleanliness.</i>
Be humble and affable to all persons and particularly to the members of your household.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">According to the text emended by GRA. V and H read: ‘Be humble and affable to return [a salutation] to your acquaintance. Be lowly of spirit with all men, with the members of your household more than with all men; and if you grumble and fight with your household, your end is for Gehinnom’.</i>
The first stage of vowing leads to folly; the first stage of [ritual] uncleanness leads to idolatry; the first stage of levity with women leads to unchastity.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ned. 20a (Sonc. ed., p. 56).</i>
If you make yourself a surety [for another] it should be with the object of paying [that surety];<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">If called upon to do so.</i> or if you become a guarantor it should be with the object of paying [the guarantee].<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Therefore do not offer to become a guarantor lightheartedly.</i> If you borrow [money] it should be with the object of repaying [the loan];<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">So borrow only if you are in a position to repay.</i> and if you lend money bear in mind that you may have to claim it<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">And have difficulty in collecting it.</i> and that you might [even] have to make a settlement.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">And lose part of the sum loaned. Another reading is <i>lehafsid</i>, ‘lose the sum’.</i><br>If one has acquired for himself a good name,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Prov. 22, 1; Eccl. 7, 1; Aboth II, 8 (Sonc. ed., II, 7, p. 17).</i> he has acquired it for himself.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In the sense that, unlike any other possession, it cannot be transmitted to another.</i> If one has acquired for himself words of Torah, he has acquired for himself the life of the World to Come.
A shamefaced person is not apt to learn, nor is an impatient person fitted to teach. An ignorant person<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">For this passage, cf. Aboth II, 6 (Sonc. ed., II, 5, p. 15, nn. 3-8).</i> cannot be pious, an uncultured person<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">One devoid of knowledge and ethical principles.</i> sin-fearing,<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">He may avoid sin from fear of the consequences but not from ethical motives.</i> or anyone who engages much<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">And leaves little or no time for study.</i> in business become a scholar. Put your mind, therefore, to the study of the Torah rather than to business.
Fifteen characteristics are mentioned in connection with a scholar, viz.: he is decorous in his entering and leaving,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">‘And leaving’ is inserted by GRA.</i> modest in his sitting,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Does not rush to occupy a front seat.</i> subtle<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">In devising ways of manifesting his fear; cf. Ber. 17a (Sonc. ed., p. 102).</i> in the fear [of God], shrewd in knowledge, discerning in his ways, [his mind] is absorptive and retentive, he answers fully,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">He takes a considerable time before answering.</i> asks in accordance with the subject-matter<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. above I, 1, n. 6.</i> and answers in accordance with the accepted decisions, listens [to others]<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Added by GRA.</i> and enlarges upon each subject, goes [to seek instruction] from the wise and learns in order to teach and practise.
Be not like the topmost lintel which is inaccessible to the feet or like the doorpost<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘the middle [post]’.</i> where anyone who sits by it is troubled and which ultimately collapses. Be like the doorstep<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘the nethermost post’.</i> on which most people tread but which remains when the whole building is in ruins.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the quality of humility. GRA emends the text to read: ‘Be not like a lintel which can injure the face (by a person crashing into it), nor like the doorpost which can hurt the legs and ultimately collapses; but be like the doorstep on which most people tread and which remains in its place even when the whole building collapses’.</i>

Chapter 4

Scholars lend dignity to a company,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Or, ‘behave well in a company’.</i> but not so ignorant men.
He who occupies himself [only] with the study of Scripture is but of indifferent merit;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘it is meritorious and not meritorious’, because the Written Torah can only be understood with the aid of the Oral Torah.</i> with Mishnah is meritorious and rewarded for it; with Talmud there can be nothing more meritorious. Yet run always to the Mishnah more than to the <i>Shas</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Because it is more easily absorbed. For this passage, cf. B.M. 33a, b (Sonc. ed., p. 206).</i>
Do your [teaching of] Torah gratuitously and accept no remuneration for it; because the Omnipresent gave it gratuitously<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ned. 36b-37a (Sonc. ed., p. 113). As Moses taught the Elders gratuitously so must they pass their teaching on to others without pay. According to the Talmud, <i>loc. cit.</i>, this does not apply to Scripture, for the teaching of which a fee is allowed.</i> and one may not take a fee for the [teaching of] words of Torah. If you should accept remuneration for the [teaching of] words of Torah, you will consequently destroy [the moral constitution of] the entire world. Say not, ‘I have no money’, since all money is His,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">He will provide you with sustenance without having to take payment for teaching.</i> as it is stated, <i>Mine is the silver, and Mine the gold, saith the Lord of hosts</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Hag. 2, 8.</i><br>If you practise charity you will merit wealth; and if you merited wealth practise charity with it. While you still possess it [live in such a manner that you] gain through it this world and also inherit the World to Come; for if you do not practise charity with it, it will suddenly disappear, as it is stated, <i>Wilt thou set thine eyes upon it?

Chapter 5

A scholar should not eat standing, lick his fingers or belch in the presence of his fellow. He talks little, jokes little, sleeps in moderation, is frugal in pleasures and minimizes ‘[Yes], yes’ or ‘No, no’.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Shebu. 36a (Sonc. ed., p. 211) where the repetition of ‘yes’ and ‘no’ is regarded as an oath. It may perhaps also mean to be sparing in making promises.</i>
A man should always make a point of knowing with whom he is sitting or standing, with whom he is sitting at table, with whom he is conversing and who is his co-signatory to a deed.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sanh. 23a (Sonc. ed., p. 131).</i>
By four things are scholars<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In ‘Erub. 65b (Sonc. ed., p. 455) the wording is: ‘By three things may a person’s’, etc., not only a scholar.</i> recognizable: by their cup,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">By the amount of liquor they consume.</i> their purse,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">By what they spend their money on.</i> their temper<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">In the Heb. there is an effective alliteration: <i>kis</i> (purse), <i>kos</i> (cup) and <i>ka‘as</i> (temper). The last indicates self-control.</i> and by their attire.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A scholar was expected to maintain cleanliness in his attire. Cf. Shab. 114a (Sonc. ed., p. 557).</i> Some say: Also by their speech.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">‘Erub. adds ‘also by their laughter’ and omits ‘by their attire’.</i>
The adornment of [knowledge of] Torah is wisdom, the adornment of wisdom is humility, the adornment of humility is fear [of God], the adornment of the fear [of God] is the performance of meritorious deeds, the adornment of the performance of meritorious deeds is modesty.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the unostentatious manner in which they are done.</i>
A man should not be awake when among those who are asleep or asleep when among those who are awake. He should not weep when among those who are joyous or be joyous when among those who weep. He should not be sitting when among those who are standing or standing when among those who are sitting. He should not study Scripture when among those who study Mishnah or study Mishnah when among those who study Scripture. This is the general rule: A man should not act differently from the practice of his fellow-men.

Chapter 6

Four things are unbecoming to scholars. One should not start out on a journey by night,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Either because of danger or not to arouse suspicion of immoral intention.</i> go out scented,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">According to Ber. 43b (Sonc. ed., p. 266) this applies to scenting one’s clothes and in a place where people are suspected of sodomy.</i> be the last to enter the Synagogue,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ber. <i>loc. cit.</i>, reads <i>‘Beth Hammidrash’</i>.</i> or frequent the society of ignorant persons.
On entering the elder precedes, on leaving the younger precedes;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Or, ‘the more important … the less important’. Cf. Ber. 61a (Sonc. ed., p. 381): ‘In conferring honour we commence with the greatest’.</i> when ascending a staircase the elder precedes, when descending a staircase the younger precedes; [when entering] a Council Chamber the elder precedes; [when entering] a prison the younger precedes; to pronounce a blessing<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">At the beginning of a meal or to recite Grace after it.</i> the elder takes precedence. The passer-by greets one who is sitting.
No person should sit down at table to eat before his elders [have taken their seat]. When cutting off a piece of bread [for Grace before meals] one should do so from the part that is baked into a crust.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. above, p. 553.</i> When one is about to eat a leek or onion, he should begin to eat from the leaves.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">And not from the top; cf. above, p. 553.</i> One should not take hold of a loaf, bite a piece off and place it back upon the table. When about to drink water in public, one should turn his face away and drink.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Because it is customary for a scholar to exercise privacy both in eating and drinking.</i>
A man should not be a caviller, trickster or tippler. He should overlook an insult and not glorify himself by his fellow’s humiliation.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Meg. 28a (Sonc. ed., p. 168).</i>
The first stage in committing a sin is impure thought, the second is scoffing, the third haughtiness, the fourth cruelty, the fifth idleness, the sixth causeless hatred and the seventh an evil eye.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">An envious nature.</i> That is what Solomon said, <i>When he speaketh fair, believe him not; for there are seven abominations in his heart</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 26, 25.</i>

Chapter 7

There are seven characteristics in an uncultured man<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <i>golem.</i> Cf. Aboth V, 10 (Sonc. ed., V, 7, pp. 64f.).</i> and seven in a wise man. A wise man does not speak before one who is greater than he in wisdom and in number,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Of years.</i> does not enter into the midst of the words of his fellow,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. does not interrupt.</i> is not hasty to answer; he asks in accordance with the subject-matter and answers in accordance with the accepted decision, speaks on the first [point] first and on the last [point] last, concerning what he has not heard he says, ‘I have not heard it’,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. above, p. 571, n. 4.</i> and acknowledges the truth.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">He does not consider it inconsistent with his dignity to admit when he is in the wrong.</i> The reverse of these are in an uncultured man.
A scholar must be modest in eating, drinking, washing, anointing,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. rubbing with oil after a bath.</i> putting his shoes on, walking, his attire, [the modulation of] his voice, expectorating<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. clearing his throat.</i> and good works.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">He should perform them unostentatiously.</i><br>As a bride keeps herself secluded all the time she is in her father’s house and only makes herself known when she goes out<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Leaves her father’s house for the wedding ceremony.</i> [as if] to say, ‘Anyone who can testify anything against me,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Against her virtue.</i> let him come and testify’, so must a scholar be modest in his [good] deeds but renowned for his conduct. He must seek truth and not falsehood, honesty and not robbery, meekness and not haughtiness, peace and not conflict, the counsel of the Elders and not the counsel of the young.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Meg. 31b (Sonc. ed., p. 192): ‘If old men say to you “Throw down” and young men say to you “Build up”, do the former’.</i> He should rather walk behind a lion than behind a woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">To avoid unchaste thoughts.</i>
He honours the wise<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Added by GRA.</i> [and does not show disrespect towards them.] What is meant by ‘honours the wise’? He gives him food and drink, dresses him and puts his shoes on for him, leads him in and out. This applies to both a teacher<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A variant is ‘a father’ in agreement with Ḳid. 31b (Sonc. ed., p. 154).</i> and a Sage.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Although he is not his teacher.</i> What is meant by ‘showing disrespect’? He must not sit in his [accustomed] place, speak<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">In Ḳid. ‘stand’; cf. also Midrash Rabbah, Num., XV, 17 (Sonc. ed., p. 660).</i> in his stead or contradict his words.
R. Ḥiyya taught: Silence is good for the wise and how much more so for fools; and so did Solomon say, <i>Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 17, 28.</i> It is not necessary to say, ‘When a <i>wise man</i> holdeth his peace’.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Because a wise man knows when to be silent.</i>

Chapter 8

Be pliable like the reed upon which the wind can blow from every direction it chooses;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

Keep aloof from anything hideous and from whatever resembles it,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

Who waives his right to retribution<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘passes by his measures’, i.e. forgoes his right to exact punishment.</i> is forgiven all his sins, as it is stated, <i>Who is a God like unto Thee, that pardoneth the iniquity, and passeth by the transgression</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Micah 7, 18.</i> [which means,] who is forgiven iniquity?

Whoever makes light of a single point of the Torah is liable to <i>kareth</i>, as it is stated, <i>Because he hath despised the word of the Lord … that soul shall utterly be cut off</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 15, 31.</i> And he who makes light of the [precept of] washing the hands will be uprooted from the world.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Added by GRA.

Whoever is not shamefaced will readily sin, as it is stated, <i>The show of their countenance doth witness against them;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. 3, 9.</i> but he who experiences shame<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. who is not callous, but is self-conscious when he is doing wrong.</i> will not readily sin, as it is stated, [<i>And Moses said unto the people: ‘Fear not; for God is come to prove you</i>] <i>and that His fear may be before you, that ye sin not</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20, 17; cf.

B.B. 98b (Sonc. ed., p. 410), a saying attributed to Ben Sira.</i> it is still more unbecoming when one eats in the presence of a scholar.

Section on Peace

R. Joshua b. Levi said: Great is peace, for peace is to the world as leaven is to dough.
