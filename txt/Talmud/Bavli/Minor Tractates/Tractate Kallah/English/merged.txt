Tractate Kallah



Chapter 1

A bride<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Here used in the sense of a betrothed girl. In the Talmudic period betrothal (<i>’erusin</i>) and marriage (<i>ḳiddushin</i>) denoted two stages different from what they are now. <i>’Erusin</i> took place in the bride’s home and <i>ḳiddushin</i> subsequently in the bridegroom’s home. It is important to note that the ceremony of <i>’erusin</i> was binding upon the bridal couple and could not be dissolved without a bill of divorce. Later the current custom prevailed whereby the two ceremonies were combined and performed at the same time (cf. P.B., pp. 298f., the benediction on the first of the pages being of <i>’erusin</i>).</i> is forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This consisted of seven benedictions. For the wording cf. K.R. I, 1, below p. 415f.; Keth. 7b-8a (Sonc. ed., pp. 31ff.); P.B., p. 299.</i> in the same manner as a <i>niddah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">In Biblical law the period of menstrual impurity lasted seven days (Lev. 15, 19ff.) but was extended by the Rabbis to eleven days. At the end of the period immersion in a ritual bath was necessary.</i> Just as a <i>niddah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Whose period of purification has ended.</i> who has not immersed [in the ritual bath] is forbidden to her husband, so likewise is a bride forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction. Whence is the benediction of bridegrooms derived from the Torah? As it is stated, <i>And they blessed Rebekah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 24, 60.</i> And whence do we derive that even a widow is so forbidden?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">On remarriage without the benediction, cf. Keth. 7a (Sonc. ed., p. 26).</i> As it is stated, <i>And he took ten men of the elders of the city … And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders said, We are witnesses. The Lord make the woman … and let thy house be like the house of Perez</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth 4, 2, 11f.</i>
After the consummation of her marriage on the first day, a bride is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">To her husband; cf. Nid. 65b (Sonc. ed., p. 460).</i> for the whole of the succeeding seven days, and it is not permitted to take any object<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘a cup’.</i> from her hand all the seven days. This is the view of R. Eliezer, but R. Joshua said: Not until the matter is examined—if she was <i>niddah</i> while still in her father’s house, she is forbidden [to her husband], but if not she is allowed to him.<br>R. Eliezer was asked, ‘Is it permissible to drink from the hand of the bride so long as her husband is sitting with her at the festive table?’ He replied, ‘Whoever drinks from the hand of a bride is as though he drinks from the hand of a harlot’. [His colleagues] said to him, ‘Are not all the daughters of Israel possessed of good manners?’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">And it is therefore usual for a bride to hand things to the guests.</i> He answered, ‘God forbid! Anyone who is not familiar with the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">And since women are not usually learned in the Torah it cannot be assumed that they possess good manners.</i> cannot be possessed of good manners’. R. Eleazar b. Azariah made a public declaration accompanied by the sounding of three hundred <i>shofars</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In K.R. I, 5, below p. 418 the reading is ‘four hundred <i>shofars</i>’. These were sounded to increase the solemnity of the declaration.</i> ‘Whether a bride be of the daughters of a scholar or of an <i>‘am ha-’areẓ</i>, he who drinks from her hand is as though he drinks from the hand of a harlot’. He further said, ‘Whoever takes a cup from the hand of a bride and drinks from it has no share in the World to Come’.
He who recites a verse from the Song of Songs<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sanh. 101a (Sonc. ed., p. 684). GRA reads ‘evil’ instead of ‘Flood’.</i> rendering it as a [secular] song, and similarly whoever recites a verse from the Torah unseasonably at banqueting tables, causes the Flood to come upon the world; because the Torah clothes itself in sackcloth, stands before the Holy One, blessed be He, and complains, ‘Sovereign of the universe! Thy children have made me as a harp upon which scorners play’. To this He replies, ‘My daughter, when they rejoice what should they do?’ She makes the rejoinder, ‘Sovereign of the universe! If he is a scholar let him occupy himself with the Torah, with study and good deeds and <i>’aggadoth;</i> let students of Scripture occupy themselves with Scripture, students of Midrash and Mishnah with the laws of Passover on Passover, the laws of Pentecost on Pentecost and the laws of Tabernacles on Tabernacles’. R. Simeon<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">GRA adds ‘b. Eleazar in the name of R. Joshua b. Ḥananiah’.</i> testified and said: Whoever reads a verse in season brings good to the world, as it is stated, <i>And a word in due season, how good is it!</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 15, 23.</i>
One who sends the cup of benediction<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Used in the Grace after meals.</i> to a woman without the knowledge of her husband forfeits his life because his mind prevailed over him.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘is great over him’. GRA emends: ‘over him’ to ‘over her’, i.e. he is attracted to her. Similarly in the next sentences.</i> Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: Because the evil inclination has prevailed over him. Similarly the members of a company who send the cup of benediction to a woman without the knowledge of her husband forfeit their lives because their minds prevailed over them. Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: Because the evil inclination has prevailed over them.

Chapter 2

He who pays money to a woman,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. ‘Erub. 18b (Sonc. ed., p. 125).</i> counting from his hand into her hand in order to gaze at her, even if he be like Moses our teacher who received the Torah from Mount Sinai, will not be exempt from the penalty of Gehinnom; as it is stated, <i>Hand to hand, the evil man shall not be unpunished</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 11, 21, E.V. <i>My hand upon it!</i></i><br>Behold Scripture declares, <i>And we have brought the Lord’s offering, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet-rings, ear-rings, and girdles, to make atonement for our souls before the Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 31, 50.</i> <i>‘Eẓadah</i> (<i>armlets</i>) means a garter; <i>ẓamid</i> (<i>bracelets</i>) silk cloaks; <i>‘agil</i> (<i>ear-rings</i>) a cast of the female breasts; <i>kumaz</i> (<i>girdles</i>) a cast of the womb. <i>To make atonement for our souls:</i> Moses said to Israel, ‘Perhaps you have returned to your former sinful lapse’.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Their association with the women of Midian; cf. Shab. 64a (Sonc. ed., p. 305).</i> They replied to him, ‘<i>There lacketh not one man of us</i>’.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 49.</i> ‘If so,’ he retorted, ‘why this atonement?’ They replied, ‘We may have escaped sin, but we have not escaped sinful thoughts’. Why [did they offer] signet-rings? Because whoever gazes intentionally at a woman is as though he had intercourse with her. Hence the Rabbis declared: Whoever touches a woman’s little finger is as though he touched ‘that place’.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The pudenda; cf. Ber. 24a (Sonc. ed., p. 145). So GRA emending the text according to the Talmudic version.</i>
He who gazes at a woman’s heel will have deformed children. [Why are children born] lame, blind, dumb or deaf? R. Eliezer said: Because [the husband] claimed marital rights but she refused. R. Joshua said: Because she declared at the time of cohabitation, ‘I have been forced’.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">To cohabitate while she was impure and nevertheless submitted.</i> R. ‘Aḳiba said: Because she says, ‘I am unclean’ when she is clean.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">To annoy him.</i> 
R. Nehemiah said: Because of the sin of causeless hatred a man’s wife suffers miscarriage, contention is rife in his house, and his sons and daughters die young.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Shab. 32b (Sonc. ed., p. 149).</i> 
R. Nehorai said: Whoever puts his neighbour to shame will in the end himself be put to shame; furthermore, the Angels of Destruction thrust and drive him out of the world and expose his shame before all mankind. But whoever is shamefaced will not speedily yield to sin; as it is stated, <i>And that His fear may be before you, that ye sin not</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20, 17.</i> As regards anyone who is not shamefaced, it is certain that his forefathers did not stand at the foot of Mount Sinai.
R. Joḥanan said:<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ned. 20a (Sonc. ed., p. 57).</i> The Ministering Angels told me four things and they are related to the lame, the blind, the dumb and the deaf. Why [are children born] lame? Because [their parents] overturned their table<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">A euphemism for unnatural intercourse.</i> and behaved like animals. Why [are children born] blind? Because [their parents] gaze at ‘that place’. Why [are children born] deaf? Because [their parents] converse<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. they conduct themselves with levity while performing a religious command.</i> during cohabitation. Why [are children born] dumb? Because [their parents] kiss ‘that place’. The Sages say that the <i>halakah</i> is not in agreement with R. Joḥanan, but a man may do with his wife as he desires;<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">At the time of cohabitation.</i> because the matter can be best compared to a man who purchased meat from the butcher: if he wishes he eats it raw, if he wishes he eats it boiled, if he wishes he eats it roasted over coals.
Imma Shalom,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ned. <i>loc. cit.</i></i> the wife of R. Eliezer and sister of Rabban Gamaliel was asked, ‘Why are your children beautiful? And during intercourse how does [your husband] conduct himself towards you?’ She replied, ‘He does not converse<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">A euphemism for cohabitation.</i> with me during the first or last watch, but only during the middle watch;<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The night was divided into three equal periods called ‘watches’.</i> [and when he cohabits] he uncovers a handbreadth and covers a handbreadth, and it is as though he was urged on by a demon. And when I questioned him, “What is the reason for all this?”<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">For selecting the middle watch.</i> he replied, “So that another woman should not come to my mind<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">During the first and last watches of the night women are to be found in the streets.</i> and my children consequently come within the category of bastards” ’. 
Hence [the Sages] declared: Ten<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">[GRA reads ‘nine’. On the wording of the passage, cf. Bacher, <i>Ag. d. pal. Amoräer</i>, II, p. 310, n. 3.]</i> categories of people are like bastards but are not [legally] such, and they are: the children [born] of fear,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Reading with Ned. 20b (Sonc. ed., p. 59) <span dir="rtl">אימה</span> (fear) for <span dir="rtl">אמה</span> (handmaid). The husband terrorizes his wife into cohabitation.</i> the children of a maidservant, the children of a hated wife, (the children of a <i>niddah</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Inserted by V in brackets.</i> the children of one who is under a ban of excommunication, the children of a woman thought to be another,<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘children of exchange’, i.e. when a man has two wives and cohabits with one under the impression that she is the other.</i> the children of [a marriage characterized by] strife, the children of a drunken woman, the children of a wife divorced in the heart,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. in the heart of her husband; he has the intention of divorcing her while yet cohabiting with her.</i> the children of promiscuity, and some add, the children of a sleeping woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">During the intercourse</i> One who has intercourse with his betrothed in her father-in-law’s house without the <i>kethubah</i> having been drawn up<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Without <i>ḳiddushin</i> having taken place, the drawing up of the <i>kethubah</i> forming part of the ceremony. Cf. the opening words of this tractate, ‘A bride is forbidden’, etc. N.Y. has another explanation based on <i>’Eben Ha‘ezer</i> LXVI, 3, viz. a man must not live with his wife without a <i>kethubah</i>. In the context this interpretation is wide of the mark.</i> will have sickly children. Weak children are the issue of those who cohabit with women who are <i>niddah;</i> ugly children [are born] of women in a doubtful state of ritual purity.
If a man, on leaving a privy, [immediately afterwards] has intercourse, he will have epileptic children, because the demon of the privy accompanies him.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Giṭ. 70a (Sonc. ed., p. 333).</i> How long should he wait before having intercourse? Long enough to walk half a <i>mil</i>. If a man has undergone blood-letting and [immediately afterwards] has intercourse, his children will be weaklings. If both<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Husband and wife.</i> have undergone blood-letting and [immediately afterwards] have intercourse, their children will be liable to have lupus.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Tuberculosis of the skin.</i> When does this apply? Only if they had nothing to eat,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Between blood-letting and the act of cohabitation.</i> but if they partook of some food there is no [harm] in it.

Chapter 3

If a man has intercourse while standing he has attacks of trembling,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Convulsions or ague.</i> and this is what is termed ‘fire of the bones’.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ber. 32a (Sonc. ed., p. 197), i.e. fever.</i> What is the remedy for it? Flour of lentils and wine. A person should take all remedies when well-fed, but this remedy when he is hungry. A person should take all remedies when standing, but this remedy with one foot in the bed and the other on the ground [51<i>a</i>]. A person should take all remedies three times in three days,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reading of GRA. V has ‘up to three hours and three times’.</i> but he should continue this remedy until he is cured.
He who is in the habit of taking black cumin will not suffer with pain of the heart. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Cumin is one of the sixty deadly poisons, and as for him who sleeps to the east of his store [of cumin], his blood is on his head.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ber. 40a (Sonc. ed., p. 247). A. Cohen, <i>Berakoth</i>, p. 264, n. 1, remarks, ‘The west wind will carry the odour to him with fatal results’ (Rashi).</i> [There is no contradiction] because the former refers to when it is baked<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">Sprinkled on baked bread.</i> and the latter when it is not baked. If one eats cumin of the weight of a <i>dinar</i> his heart will be affected; so too if he eats forty eggs, forty nuts or a quarter of a <i>log</i> of honey. 
Likewise, if one eats fat beef<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Giṭ. 70a (Sonc. ed., p. 332) which omits ‘fat’.</i> with vegetables on the night of the fourteenth and fifteenth of the month and sleeps in [the light of the full] moon in the summer solstice, his blood is on his head.<br>If one has intercourse when drunk,<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Giṭ. <i>loc. cit.</i> (Sonc. ed., p. 334).</i> [his heart] will ultimately be affected; if both of them are drunk their hearts will be affected. If one has intercourse by the light of a lamp, he will have epileptic children.<br>If one has intercourse sitting, he will be subject to diarrhoea. What is the remedy for it? Crocus of thorns. If he is below and she above he will be seized with convulsions;<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Giṭ. <i>loc. cit.</i></i> he above and she below, this is the normal way of human beings; if the two of them lie facing one another, this is a form of perversion.<br>R. Judah said: The bold-faced are [destined] to Gehinnom and the shamefaced to the Garden of Eden.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Aboth V, 23 (Sonc. ed., V, 20, pp. 73f).</i>
The bold-faced, R. Eliezer said, is the bastard; the son of a <i>niddah</i>, said R. Joshua; R. ‘Aḳiba said: Both a bastard and the son of a <i>niddah</i>. The elders were once sitting in the gate when two young lads passed by; one covered his head and the other uncovered his head. Of him who uncovered his head R. Eliezer remarked that he is a bastard; R. Joshua remarked that he is the son of a <i>niddah;</i> R. ‘Aḳiba said that he is both a bastard and the son of a <i>niddah</i>. They said to R. ‘Aḳiba, ‘How did your heart induce you to contradict the opinion of your colleagues?’ He replied, ‘I will prove it concerning him’. He went to the lad’s mother and found her sitting in the market selling beans. He said to her, ‘My daughter, if you will answer the question which I will put to you, I will bring you to the World to Come’. She said to him, ‘Swear it to me’. R. ‘Aḳiba, taking the oath with his lips but annulling it in his heart, said to her, ‘What is the status of your son?’ She replied, ‘When I entered the bridal chamber I was <i>niddah</i> and my husband kept away from me; but my best man<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Both bridegroom and bride had ‘best men’, i.e. friends to attend to their interests(cf. Tosiftha Keth. I, 4).</i> had intercourse with me and this son was born to me’. Consequently the child was both a bastard and the son of a <i>niddah</i>. It was declared, ‘R. ‘Aḳiba showed himself a great man when he contradicted his teachers’. At the same time they added, ‘Blessed be the God of Israel, Who revealed His secret to R. ‘Aḳiba b. Joseph’.

Chapter 4

R. Joḥai<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">GRA and H read ‘Aḥai’.</i> b. Josiah said: He who diverts his mind<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘empties his mind’ of serious matters. H. reads ‘he who gazes’, <span dir="rtl">המצפה</span> for <span dir="rtl">המפנה</span>.</i> with women will eventually come within the power of sin. And he who diverts himself from sin and does not commit it, even though he be an Israelite,<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. a non-priest.</i> he is worthy to offer a burnt-offering on the altar as did the High Priest; as it is stated, <i>And he sent the young men of the children of Israel who offered burnt-offerings</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 24, 5. They were pure-minded young men and therefore performed the functions of the priests.</i> And whoever makes himself indolent so as not to sin and does not commit it will be sustained by the lustre of the Divine Presence like the Ministering Angels; as it is stated, <i>And they beheld God, and did eat and drink</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 11, explained in a spiritual sense: they enjoyed the lustre of the Divine Presence.</i>
R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: Whoever masturbates is as though he committed murder;<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Nid. 13a (Sonc. ed., p. 86).</i> as it is stated, <i>That slay</i> [<i>shoḥeṭë</i>] <i>the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. 57, 5.</i> Do not read <i>shoḥeṭë</i> but <i>soḥeṭë</i> (‘that squeeze out’). And the Sages said: He is as though he worshipped idols, as it is stated, <i>Ye that inflame yourselves among the terebinths, under every leafy tree</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i></i>
Rabbi [Eliezer b. Jacob] said: Whoever changes his word is as if he worshipped idols,<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sanh. 92a (Sonc. ed., p. 617).</i> as it is stated, <i>My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a mocker</i> (<i>metha‘tea‘</i>),<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 27, 12.</i> and <i>metha‘tea‘</i> means nothing else than idolatry, as it is stated, <i>They are vanity, a work of delusion</i> (<i>ta‘tu‘im</i>).<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Jer. 51, 18.</i>
[<i>Ye that inflame yourselves among the terebinths</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The Biblical verse is inserted by H.</i>—hence the Sages declared: A man may not put his hand to his membrum. There are three [instances of abuse by] the hand and in all three [the hand merits] amputation:<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Shab. 108b (Sonc. ed., p. 529).</i> The hand that is put to the membrum let it be cut off! The hand that is put to the eye let it be cut off! The hand that is put to the vein for blood-letting let it be cut off! ‘The hand that is put to the membrum let it be cut off!’ Because it causes sexual excitement. ‘The hand that is put to the eye, let it be cut off!’ Because it leads to blindness.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">Unclean hands, especially before they are washed in the morning, cause ‘infection’.</i> ‘The hand that is put to the vein for blood-letting let it be cut off!’ Because it leads to death.
Another interpretation of <i>Ye that inflame yourselves among the terebinths:</i> Whoever excites himself in order to masturbate is considered to be like an animal. Just as an animal is not mindful of what it does so is he; just as an animal is ignorant of what leads to death so is he; just as an animal is only destined for slaughter and has no portion in the World to Come, he too has no portion in the World to Come. Of him Solomon in his wisdom declared, <i>Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward</i><sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 3, 21.</i>—this refers to the souls of the righteous who do not arouse themselves and do not masturbate. <i>And the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i></i>—this refers to the souls of the wicked who arouse themselves and masturbate.
Another interpretation of <i>Ye that inflame yourselves among the terebinths:</i> Whoever arouses himself and masturbates forfeits his life, as it is stated, <i>And Er, Judah’s first-born, was wicked in the sight of the Lord; and the Lord slew him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 38, 7. His sin was that he prevented pregnancy; cf. Midrash Rabbah, Genesis, LXXXV, 4 (Sonc. ed., p. 792).</i> And whoever deliberately causes an erection is a transgressor, as it is stated, <i>And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of the Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 10; cf. the preceding verse.</i><br>Even children meet the Divine Presence, as it is stated, <i>A seed shall serve him; it shall be told of the Lord unto the next generation</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 22, 31; cf. Sanh. 110b (Sonc. ed., p. 761). <i>It shall be told</i> indicates that when God’s glory can be related by a person, i.e. even a child when he is able to speak, he earns his right to a share in the World to Come.</i> For what sin do a man’s children die [young]?<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Shab. 32b (Sonc. ed., p. 148); cf. Midrash Ecclesiastes 4, 1 (Sonc. ed., p. 110).</i> R. Eliezer said: For the sin of [unfulfilled] vows, as it is said, <i>Suffer not thy mouth to bring thy flesh into guilt … and destroy the work of thy hands</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 5, 5.</i> R. Nathan said: For the sin of [neglecting] the <i>mezuzah</i>, as it is written, <i>And thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house, and upon thy gates</i> which is followed by <i>that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The prolonged life of the children is made conditional in Deut. 11, 20f., on the fulfilment of the preceding commandment.</i> R. Nehorai said: For the sin of [neglecting] the <i>ẓiẓith</i>, as it is written, <i>Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Jer. 2, 34; <i>skirts</i> refers to the precept of <i>ẓiẓith</i>.</i> R. Joshua<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">GRA. emends to ‘R. Judah the Prince’.</i> said: For the sin of [neglecting the study of] the Torah children die young, as it is stated, <i>Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Hos. 4, 6. The parallel in Shab. 32b (Sonc. ed., p. 148) cites Jer. 2, 30.</i> R. ‘Aḳiba said: Whoever does not occupy himself with [the study of] the Torah causes poverty to come upon his children.<br>What should a man do so that his children shall grow rich and flourish?<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">Reading with GRA <span dir="rtl">ויתקיימו</span>.</i> Let him fulfil the will of God and the wishes of his wife. This is the will of God: Let him freely distribute his money to the poor, as it is stated, <i>He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the needy; his righteousness endureth for ever</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 112, 9.</i>

Chapter 5

It is related of R. Ṭarfon that, although he was very wealthy, he did not give gifts to the poor [in adequate manner]. Once R. ‘Aḳiba met him and said to him, ‘Master, would you like me to purchase one or two cities for you?’ He replied, ‘Yes’ and forthwith handed R. ‘Aḳiba four thousand golden <i>dinars</i>. R. ‘Aḳiba took the money and distributed it among the poor. Later R. Ṭarfon met him and asked, ‘Where are the cities which you purchased for me?’ [R. ‘Aḳiba] took him by the hand and led him to the House of Study. He produced a Book of Psalms and placed it in front of them both. They went on reading until they came to the verse, <i>He hath scattered abroad</i>, etc., and then he exclaimed, ‘This is the city which I bought for you’. Thereupon R. Ṭarfon stood up, kissed him and said to him, ‘My teacher and friend—my teacher in wisdom, my friend in social conduct’, and gave him still more money to distribute.
It is further related of R.
