Tractate Kallah Rabbati



Chapter 1

<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The Baraithoth in chaps. I and II are repeated from tractate <i>Kallah</i>, correspondence with which is indicated in the notes. The commentary on that tractate is not reproduced here and should be referred to.<br>K (Kallah) 1.</i> A bride is forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction in the same manner as a <i>niddah</i> who has not immersed; just as a <i>niddah</i> who has not immersed is forbidden to her husband, so likewise is a bride forbidden to her husband without the [marriage] benediction.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Raba said: Of which benediction do [the Sages] speak? The benediction [consisting of] seven [blessings] and not the benediction of betrothal. Which is the benediction of betrothal? R. Judah said in the name of Rab:<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Keth. 7b (Sonc. ed., p. 30); P.B., p. 298.</i> ‘[Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe,] Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments, and hast commanded us concerning forbidden relations and hast forbidden us unto the betrothed and hast allowed us unto the wedded by the rite of the [marriage] canopy and sanctification. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who sanctified Israel by the rite of the canopy and sanctification’.<br>In what order are the [seven] blessings recited? R. Levi said: ‘Who created the fruit of the vine’, and ‘Who hast created all things to Thy glory’. ‘Blessed art Thou the Creator of man.’ ‘Blessed art Thou Who hast made man in Thine image, after Thy likeness, and hast prepared unto him, out of his very self, a fabric for ever. Blessed art Thou, Creator of man.’ ‘May [Zion] who was barren be exceeding glad and exult, when her children are gathered within her in joy. Blessed art Thou Who makest Zion joyful through her children.’ ‘O make these loved companions greatly to rejoice, even as of old Thou didst gladden Thy creature in the Garden of Eden. Blessed art Thou Who makest bridegroom and bride to rejoice.’ ‘Blessed art Thou Who hast created joy and gladness, bridegroom and bride, mirth, pleasure, exultation, love, brotherhood, peace and fellowship. Soon may there be heard in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy and gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the jubilant voice of bridegrooms from their canopies, and of youths from their feasts of song. Blessed art Thou Who makest the bridegroom to rejoice with the bride.’<br>An objection was raised: [It is stated,] <i>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20, 7; Deut. 5, 11.</i> To what does this refer? For instance, to one who recites a benediction unnecessarily; but here he recites the benediction, ‘Who created the fruit of the vine’! So how may he do it? He tastes of [the wine].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The act of tasting the wine makes the benediction necessary.</i> But the master has said: If he tasted it, he disqualifies it!<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Another benediction cannot be made over that cup until more wine is added; cf. Ber. 52a (Sonc. ed., p. 314).</i> He pours [some wine] from the cup into his hand and drinks it. This is possible when wine is available, but what if no wine is available? Over what may he recite the benediction? Over beer. May [one recite it] over [the juice of] the date-berry?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">V has a word which is unknown; it may be a corruption of <i>kufra</i>, ‘the date-berry’.</i> [If there is no wine] it must be over water or bread.<br>The question was asked: If one recited all the [seven] benedictions out of their proper sequence, or if he omitted one of them, what is the law? Come and hear: Benedictions do not invalidate one another.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">If the order is changed; cf. Ber. 11b (Sonc. ed., p. 66).</i> Levi was present at a wedding feast and recited six<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In Keth. 8a (Sonc. ed., p. 33) the number is given as ‘five’.</i> [benedictions]; deduce from this that although one is omitted we are not concerned. Perhaps there the case was different because [Levi held the view that] there was one formation.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">That the creation of men and women is alluded to in the third benediction, and the second is unnecessary as a separate benediction for the creation of man.</i>
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">K 1.</i> And whence is the benediction of bridegrooms derived from the Torah? As it is stated, <i>And they blessed Rebekah</i>.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Did they, then, bless her over a cup [of wine]? This is but a support [and not a proof for the necessity of a benediction]. R. Joḥanan said: It is derived from the verse, <i>And God blessed them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 1, 28.</i> But how will he explain that concerning [other] living creatures it is also written, <i>And God blessed them?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 22.</i> But [the benediction is required] because it is written, <i>And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from the man, made He</i> [<i>banah</i>]<i> a woman;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> II, 22.</i> for in the coast towns they call plaits <i>binyatha</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf. ARN IV, 3, above p. 36.] Adam and Eve are in a different category in that God plaited Eve’s hair and brought her adorned to Adam.</i>
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">K 1.</i> And whence do we derive that even a widow requires the benedictions? As it is stated, <i>And he took ten men</i> … and it is further written, <i>And all the people that were in the gate and the elders said, We are witnesses … the Lord make</i>, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Boaz was a widower and Ruth a widow.</i><br><small>GEMARA</small>. Deduce from this that the benediction of bridegrooms needs [the presence of] ten persons, and also infer that we recite the benediction even in the case of a widower who marries a widow. An objection was raised: In which cases do we recite the benediction? When a bachelor marries a spinster, or a bachelor marries a widow, or a widower marries a spinster; but not in a marriage between a widower and a widow! There [the recital of the benediction] is during the seven days.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">When a widower marries a widow the benedictions are recited on the first day only, but in other cases all the seven days of the marriage feast; cf. Keth. 7b (Sonc. ed., p. 31).</i>
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">K 2.</i> After the consummation of her marriage on the first day, a bride is forbidden to her husband for the whole of the succeeding seven days. This is the view of R. Eliezer. R. Joshua said: Not until the matter is examined; if she was <i>niddah</i> while still in her father’s house she is forbidden [to him], but if not she is allowed [to him].<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Wherein do they<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliezer and R. Joshua.</i> dispute? R. Eliezer adheres to his view [that she is forbidden] lest she was losing blood but was unaware of it. R. Joshua adheres to his view that it is possible for the matter to be examined. And how long [is she forbidden]? R. Joshua said: For three days.
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">K 3.</i> R. Eliezer was asked, ‘Is it permissible to drink from [the hand of] the bride so long as her husband is sitting with her at the festive table?’ He replied, ‘Whoever drinks from [the hand of] the bride is as though he drank from the hand of a harlot’. [His colleagues] said to him, ‘Are not the daughters of Israel possessed of good manners?’ He answered, ‘God forbid! Anyone who is not familiar with the Torah cannot be possessed of good manners’. R. Eleazar b. Azariah made a public proclamation accompanied by the sounding of four hundred <i>shofars</i>, ‘He who receives a cup from the bride will never be pardoned’.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Wherein do they<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliezer and the Sages opposed to him.</i> dispute? The Sages are of the opinion that since she is the daughter of a scholar she continues the customs of her father;<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">And would disregard any improper advances made to her.</i> whereas R. Eliezer maintains that a woman follows in the ways of her husband.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">And can be easily misled.</i><br>The story<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. ‘A.Z. 39a (Sonc. ed., p. 193).</i> is told of a woman, married to a scholar, that she used to bind the <i>tefillin</i> around his arm. The scholar died and she married a tax-collector and used to attach the tax-seals for him. R. Eleazar b. Azariah made a public proclamation. ‘Infer from this that thinking a thing is like doing it’. [And should you say that it is not so,] why do we then take the stricter view and declare that he<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">viz. one who receives a cup of wine from the hand of the bride, and there it can only be a case of impure thought and not of improper action.</i> will never be pardoned? I will answer you, ‘ “Thinking” is not like “doing”, since it is written, <i>If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear!</i>’<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 66, 18.</i> [Thinking in connection with] a married woman is different because it is much stricter.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">It may lead to a grave moral lapse.</i><br>Raba expounded: What is the meaning of the verse, <i>Good and upright is the Lord; therefore doth He instruct sinners in the way?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XXV, 9.</i> Come and see the righteousness of the Holy One, blessed be He. Whoever has the intention to perform a precept but under duress fails to perform it, Scripture accounts it to him as though he had fulfilled it;<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ḳid. 40a (Sonc. ed., p. 196).</i> and whoever has the intention to commit a sin is not regarded as guilty until the time of its commission; as it is written, <i>If I had regarded iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear</i>.
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">K 4.</i> He who recites a verse from the Song of Songs rendering it as a [secular] song, and similarly whoever recites a verse from the Torah unseasonably brings evil upon the world; because the Torah clothes itself in sackcloth, stands before the Holy One, blessed be He, and complains, ‘Sovereign of the universe! Thy children have made me as a harp upon which the nations [of the world] play’. To this He replies, ‘My daughter, when they rejoice what should they do?’ She makes rejoinder, ‘Let them occupy themselves with the study of the Torah, the Mishnah, <i>halakoth</i> and <i>’aggadoth;</i> and if they be unlearned let them occupy themselves with the laws of Passover on Passover, the laws of Pentecost on Pentecost and the laws of Tabernacles on Tabernacles’. R. Simeon b. Eleazar testified in the name of R. Joshua b. Ḥananiah: Whoever reads a verse in season brings good to the world.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. How can it be like a [secular] song? For instance, he chants [the text] but his mind is on [sinful] thoughts, and the verse which he recites from the Torah unseasonably is like reciting from Lamentations. Raba said: A verse [recited] in season is like bread in time of hunger, and out of season is like bread in time of plenty.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">One derives no enjoyment from it as one does in a time of scarcity.</i>
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">K 5.</i> One who sends the cup of benediction to a woman without her husband’s knowledge forfeits his life because his mind has prevailed over him. Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: Because the evil inclination has prevailed over him.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Raba said: Why is the word for ‘woman’ <i>’ishshah?</i> Because she is fire [<i>’esh</i>]; and [why is the word for ‘man’] <i>’ish?</i> Because he is fire. The letters <i>yod</i> from <i>’ish</i> and <i>he</i> from <i>’ishshah</i> form the Divine Name [<i>Yah</i>] which is conferred upon them. If they both become overheated [from sexual excitement] the Divine Name departs from them and they are [only] fire and fire.
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">K 5.</i> Similarly the members of a company who send the cup of benediction to a woman without the knowledge of her husband forfeit their lives because their minds prevailed over them. Rabbi [Judah the Prince] said: Because the evil inclination has prevailed over them.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. What need is there to state ‘similarly the members of a company’? One might [erroneously] have thought that only an individual is forbidden but not a company; therefore it teaches us that since it is done without her husband’s knowledge any dissolute person [in the company] may have been inflamed because of her.
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">K 6.</i> He who pays money to a woman, counting it from his hand into her hand in order to gaze at her, even if he be great like Moses, who received the Torah from Sinai, will not be free from the penalty of Gehinnom; as it is stated, <i>Hand to hand, the evil man shall not be unpunished</i>.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Since [sending a cup of wine to a woman] is prohibited, what is the necessity for [a separate regulation about counting] money? With the former it is forbidden if done without the husband’s knowledge; but with the latter it is forbidden even if done with the husband’s knowledge. Alternatively, with the former it is forbidden in the case of one who is not [suspected] of evil thoughts, but with the latter it is forbidden in the case of one who is [suspected] of evil thoughts. It has been taught: The same [rule applies] if one bride sends gifts from her festive table to another bride.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The text is doubtful and H conjectures the reading <i>lehakkallah lifnë ba‘alah</i>, ‘to another bride in her husband’s presence’. Here, too, there may be an evil intention.</i>
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">K 7.</i> Behold Scripture declares, <i>And we have brought the Lord’s offering … armlets and bracelets, signet rings, ear-rings and girdles to make atonement for our souls before the Lord. ’Eẓadah</i> [armlets] means a garter; <i>ẓamid</i> [bracelets] silk cloaks; <i>‘agil</i> [ear-rings] a cast of the female breasts and <i>kumaz</i> [girdles] a cast of the womb. For what purpose [are the words added], <i>to make atonement for our souls before the Lord?</i> Moses said, ‘Perhaps you have returned to your former sinful lapse’. They replied to him, ‘<i>There lacketh not one man of us</i>’. ‘If so’, he retorted, ‘why this atonement?’ They answered, ‘We have escaped sin but we have not escaped sinful thoughts’. Hence the Rabbis declared: Whoever touches a woman’s little finger is as though he touched ‘that place’.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. When [the Israelites] came to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">During the war against Midian.</i> Moses said to them, <i>Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 31, 17.</i> How would they know [the latter]? Rab said:<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Yeb. 60b (Sonc. ed., p. 403).</i> They were made to pass in front of the <i>ẓiẓ;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The gold plate worn by the High Priest on his forehead (Ex. 28, 36ff.).</i> if she was a virgin her face did not turn pale, if not a virgin her face turned pale. Mar said: Dropsy is a sign of sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">It may be the effect of a dissolute life.</i>
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">K 8.</i> Whoever gazes upon a woman’s heel will have children deformed from birth. Why [are children born] lame, blind, dumb or deaf? R. Eliezer said: Because [the husband] claimed marital rights but she refused. R. Joshua said: Because she declared at the time of cohabitation, ‘I have been forced’. R. ‘Aḳiba said: Because they talk in causeless hatred.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Raba said: They made this statement [even] of one’s wife. [His colleagues] remarked, ‘[In that case] you do not allow people an opportunity to carry on life!’<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Owing to the strictness of the regulations on cohabitation.</i> [He replied,] ‘But [the regulations on] cohabitation are as just stated, and [the deformed child] is conceived from such intercourse’.<br>‘R. Eliezer said: Because [the husband] claimed marital rights.’<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Quoted from the Baraitha.</i> Then the two of them<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">R. Eliezer and R. Joshua.</i> deal with cases where force is used, so in what do they differ? One holds that it is force before cohabitation which is the cause [of children born deformed], while the other holds that it is force at the time of cohabitation which is the cause.
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">K 8.</i> R. Nehemiah said: Because of the sin of causeless hatred a man’s wife suffers miscarriage, his children die young, and contention is rife in his house.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. It is quite reasonable [to say] that causeless hatred brings about strife, as it is written, <i>Hatred stirreth up strifes;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 10, 12.</i> but whence do we learn [that it causes] miscarriage? As it is written, <i>In vain have I smitten your children</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">Jer. 2, 30.</i> [<i>in vain</i> meaning] for causeless strifes.
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">K 9.</i> R. Joḥanan b. Dahabai said: The Ministering Angels told me four things, viz.: Why [are children born] lame? Because [their parents] overturned their tables. Why [are children born] blind? Because [their parents] gazed at ‘that place’. Why [are children born] dumb? Because [their parents] kiss ‘that place’. Why [are children born] deaf? Because [their parents] converse during cohabitation.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Raba said: All the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, [are exercised towards man on the principle of] measure for measure. Man ‘overturned his table’, therefore the feet of his children are deformed;<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘overturned’.</i> he gazed at the pudenda which should be hidden from all, therefore is he hidden from his children;<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Being blind, they never see him.</i> he showed no regard for the mouth that speaks and by which the kiss [of love] is given and kissed what is closed,<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the ‘dumb mouth’ of the body.</i> therefore the mouth of his children is closed; he conversed at a time when he should have been silent, therefore the ear [52<i>a</i>] of his children is silenced. Why is [a deaf person] termed <i>ḥeresh?</i> Because he keeps silent [<i>ḥoresh</i>], as it is written, <i>And Jacob held his peace</i> [<i>weheḥerish</i>] <i>until they came</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 34, 5.</i> Raba said: All these [children are so affected only] if they are conceived from such cohabitation.
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">K 9.</i> The Sages say that the <i>halakah</i> is not in agreement with R. Joḥanan b. Dahabai; but a man may do with his wife as he desires, because the matter can be best compared to a man who purchased meat from the butcher; if he wishes he eats it roasted on coals, if he wishes he eats it salted. The matter may also be compared to fish bought from fishermen: if [the purchaser] wishes he eats it preserved in salt, if he wishes he eats it roasted, if he wishes he eats it grilled on coal.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Since R. Joḥanan b. Dahabai did not make the statement on his own account [but quoted it in the name of the Ministering Angels], why did not the Rabbis agree with him? R. Joḥanan used the phrase ‘are forbidden’,<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">‘Forbidden’ normally means that which is disallowed by the Torah or Rabbinic law.</i> whereupon the Rabbis said to him, ‘Seeing that you made your statement in the name of the Ministering Angels it must be so; but there is no actual prohibition against it’. He replied, ‘You must agree with me that [children are born deformed] for the reason given’. Know that this is so, because [the Rabbis] replied to him with the phrase ‘if he wishes’.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">Knowing what the serious consequences can be, a man can act as he likes in this matter.</i> Why was it necessary to teach [the comparison with] ‘fish bought from fishermen’? Since they had previously cited [the comparison with] ‘meat purchased from the butcher’, he said to them, ‘But in connection with meat, if a man wished for [prohibited] fat, he may not eat it!’ They then gave [the comparison with] ‘fish bought from fishermen’.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">The retort made against the first comparison could not be made against the second.</i>
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">K 10.</i> Imma Shalom, the wife of R. Eliezer and sister of Rabban Gamaliel, was asked, ‘Why are your children beautiful? And during intercourse how does [your husband] conduct himself towards you?’ She replied, ‘He does not converse with me during the first or last watch of the night, but only during the middle watch; [and when he cohabits] he uncovers a handbreadth and covers a handbreadth, and is as though he were urged on by a demon. And when I questioned him, “What is the reason for all this?” he replied, “So that another woman should not come to my mind and my children consequently come within the category of bastards” ’.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. At first they said to her, ‘Your children are beautiful’.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">It is explained how they came to question her on such intimate matters.</i> She blushed and would not say anything to them. Then they said to her, ‘We are anxious to learn [a subject connected with] Torah but feel diffident [to ask you]. How does [your husband] conduct himself towards you during intercourse?’ When she perceived that such [was their purpose], she gave them a full account. Not during the first watch or during the last watch which are the normal periods for intercourse [did he cohabit], but during the middle watch which is not the normal period for intercourse.
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">K 10. There are some differences in the two versions.</i> Hence [the Rabbis] declared: Ten categories of persons are like bastards but are not [legally] such, and they are: the children of a <i>niddah</i>, the children of one who is under a ban of excommunication, the children [born] of fear, the children of a woman who is forced [to cohabit], the children of a hated wife, the children of a seduced woman, the children of a wife divorced in the heart, the children of a woman thought to be another, the children of a drunken woman; and some say, the children of a brazen woman, of a woman asleep and of one who has intercourse with his betrothed in his father-in-law’s house.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. The children of a <i>niddah</i> ultimately become leprous; the children of one under excommunication will ultimately be banned from the congregation of Israel, the children of fear will ultimately remove themselves from the source of holiness,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">They will abandon the Torah.</i> the children of a hated woman will hate the precepts [of the Torah], the children of a woman who had been forced will themselves be violated,<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">H quotes authority for the reading <span dir="rtl">אָנוסִין</span> (violaters) and not <span dir="rtl">אֲנו·סִין</span> or <span dir="rtl">נאנסין</span> (violated).</i> as for the children of a seduced woman ultimately others will seduce their heart, the children of a woman divorced in the heart will ultimately divorce themselves from all good and cleave to evil, the children of a woman thought to be another will ultimately change their faith, the children of a drunken woman will have children who will [be thought of] as though they were drunk, as it is written, <i>How long wilt thou be drunken?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">1 Sam. 1, 14.</i> which is rendered in the Targum ‘demented’. ‘Some say, the children of a brazen woman’: these are persons who are bold-faced; ‘the children of a woman asleep’: these are the sluggish. With regard to the children of ‘one who has intercourse with his betrothed in his father-in-law’s house’ there is a difference of opinion between Rab and Samuel: one says that the child is a bastard, and the other that he is the child of unknown paternity.<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Under Jewish law both suffer from certain disqualifications.</i>
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">K 11f.</i> If a man on leaving a privy [immediately afterwards] has intercourse, he will have epileptic children, because the demon of the privy accompanies him. How long should he wait [before having intercourse]? Long enough to walk a <i>mil</i>. If a man has undergone blood-letting and [immediately afterwards] has intercourse, his children will be weaklings.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. [‘Weaklings’]<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Inserted by H.</i> are the offspring of one who is under the ban of excommunication; ugly are the children of [intercourse when the woman is in] a doubtful state of purity.
<small>BARAITHA</small>. <sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">Partly K 12, 13, 14.</i>If both have undergone blood-letting and [immediately afterwards] have intercourse, their children will be liable to lupus. When does this apply? Only if they had nothing to eat. If a man has intercourse when drunk, ultimately [his heart] will be affected; if both of them are drunk their hearts will be affected. If one has intercourse standing he has attacks of trembling [<i>’aḥilu</i>].<br><small>GEMARA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">This Gemara corresponds to K 13 with some variations.</i> What is <i>’aḥilu?</i> Fire of the bones. What is the cure for it? Flour of lentils in wine. Samuel said: A man should practise all remedies when he is hungry, but this remedy when he is well fed. All remedies should be practised when standing on the ground, but this remedy even with one foot on the ground and one foot on the bed. All remedies [should be continued] three, seven or twelve [consecutive times], but this remedy until he is cured.
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">K 13.</i> He who is in the habit of taking black cumin will not suffer with pain of the heart. Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel said: Cumin is one of the deadly poisons, and as for him who sleeps to the east of his store [of cumin] his blood is on his head.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Here is a contradiction between the Rabbis!<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">One view is that black cumin is good for the health and the other that it is a deadly poison.</i> [One speaks of cumin when] it is baked and the other when it is raw.
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">K 13. In H this precedes the previous Baraitha.</i> If one eats cumin of the weight of a <i>dinar</i> his heart will be affected; so too if he eats forty nuts, forty eggs or a quarter of a <i>log</i> of honey.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. R. Joseph said: Only if [he eats them] on an empty stomach.
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">K 13.</i> If one eats fat beef with vegetables on the nights of the fourteenth and fifteenth of the month and sleeps in [the light of the full] moon in the summer solstice, his blood is on his head.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. What is the reason? Because his bowels are chilled and he becomes weak.
<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">The first sentence does not occur in K, the second is from §14.</i> If one stands naked in front of the lamp he will become epileptic.

They said to R. ‘Aḳiba, ‘How did your heart induce you to contradict the opinion of your colleagues?’ He replied, ‘I will prove it concerning him’. He went to the lad’s mother and found her sitting in the market selling beans. He said to her, ‘My daughter, if you will answer the question which I will put to you, I will bring you to the World to Come’. She said to him, ‘Swear it to me’. R. ‘Aḳiba, taking the oath with his lips but annulling it in his heart, said to her, ‘What is the status of your son?’ She replied, ‘When I entered the bridal chamber I was <i>niddah</i> and my husband kept away from me, but my best man had intercourse with me and this son was born to me’. Consequently the child was both a bastard and the son of a <i>niddah</i>. It was declared, ‘R. ‘Aḳiba showed himself to be a great man when he contradicted his teachers’.

Isaac b. Parnak said: All man’s sins are engraven in his bones and all his merits are inscribed on his right hand, so that you shall not say that their sins are recorded and their merits are not. Whence [is this learnt]? As it is stated, <i>The Lord is thy keeper, the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 121, 5, <i>shade</i>, meaning divine protection, in reward for a person’s merits; cf. <i>ibid.</i> XCI, 1.</i><br>R. Joshua b. Levi said: It is necessary for a man to take these words to heart, and then he will repent of his own accord. Come and see what is written, <i>For, lo, He that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought</i> [<i>siḥo</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Amos 4, 13.</i> In the hour of his death man is reminded even of his least important talk [<i>siḥah</i>]. How is this? When a man is about to die, three Ministering Angels come to him:<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. ‘A.Z. 20b (Sonc. ed., p. 105).</i> one is the Angel of Death, the second is a scribe and the third the angel who has been given authority over him who says to him, ‘Arise, your appointed time has come’. He replies, ‘I will not come; my appointed time has not yet arrived’. Thereupon the scribe sits down and calculates his days and years. Immediately the human being opens his eyes and, seeing the Angel of Death, trembles and falls upon his face. The Sages said: The Angel of Death extends in length from one end of the world to the other; from the sole of his foot to the top of his head he is [covered] all over with eyes; his clothing is of fire, his feet are of fire, and on the fiery sword in his hand hangs a drop of gall. From this [drop of gall] man dies, from it [the corpse] decomposes, from it his face becomes sallow, and he does not die until he beholds the Holy One, blessed be He; as it is stated, <i>For man shall not see Me and live</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 33, 20.</i> [meaning,] in their lifetime they do not see Me, but at their death they do see Me, as it is stated, <i>All they that go down to the dust shall kneel before Him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 22, 30.</i> Forthwith man testifies against himself all that he had done in this world.

Leviṭas, a man of Jabneh, said: Be exceedingly lowly of spirit, since the hope of man is but the worm.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth IV, 4 (Sonc. ed., p. 45).</i> Hence our Rabbis taught: [The way of the disciples of the wise is to be] meek and lowly of spirit.

Our Rabbis taught: Whence [do we know that a disciple of the wise should be] meek? From Moses our teacher, as it is stated, <i>Now the man Moses was very meek;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 12, 3.</i> and on that account Moses was praised, as it is stated, <i>My servant Moses is not so</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 7. Moses is described as <i>My servant</i>.</i> [We learn that the disciple of the wise must be] lowly of spirit from Aaron, for it is written, <i>For the priest’s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Mal. 2, 7.</i> and it is written, <i>The law of truth was in his mouth and unrighteousness was not found in his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and did turn many away from iniquity</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 6.</i><br>There is no one more lowly of spirit than he who pursues peace. Consider, how can a man pursue peace if he be not lowly of spirit? How [does he act]? If a man curse him, he says to him, ‘Peace be upon you!’; should a man quarrel with him, he keeps silent; and further, if two men have quarrelled, he humbles his spirit, approaches them and effects a reconciliation between them.<br>Such, indeed, was the procedure of Aaron, the righteous. When he heard of two men who had quarrelled, he would go to one and say to him, ‘So-and-so, peace be upon you, my master!’ and he replied, ‘Peace be upon you, my master and teacher! What does my master seek here?’ He then said, ‘So-and-so, your friend, sent me to you to appease you, because he declares, “I have offended my friend” ’. Immediately the man reflects, ‘A righteous man like him has come to appease me!’ and exclaims, ‘Master, it was I who offended him’. [Aaron] then went to the other man and said the same to him. When the two meet on the way, one says to the other, ‘Forgive me for the offence which I did to you’ and the other speaks likewise.<br>When [Aaron] heard of a husband and wife who had quarrelled, he would go to the husband and say to him, ‘[I have come] because I heard that you have quarrelled<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Adopting the reading of H.

In consequence of this all Israel, men and women, loved him. Know that it was so; for what does Scripture relate when Moses our teacher died? <i>And the children of Israel wept for Moses;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 34, 8.</i> but of Aaron it is written, <i>They wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 20, 29.</i>—that is to say, even the women. Not only [did the women mourn], but they also covered their young children with mud and dust, thereby confirming the word <i>all</i>. It has been taught: Eighty thousand young men named Aaron followed Aaron’s bier. They were the issue of those who wanted to divorce but retracted and their wives became pregnant.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In gratitude to Aaron they gave their sons his name.</i><br>We have learnt there:<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth I, 12 (Sonc. ed., p. 8).</i> Hillel said: Be of the disciples of Aaron, loving peace, pursuing peace, loving your fellow-creatures and drawing them near to the Torah. It is quite right with ‘loving peace’ as we have already mentioned; but where [in the Torah] is ‘pursuing peace’ [enjoined]? As it has been taught: <i>Seek peace, and pursue it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 34, 15. Cf. j.Pe’ah I, 1, 15d, where the comment is made: <i>Seek peace</i> in your place, <i>and pursue it</i> in another place.</i> And wherein do all other precepts differ from it? A man is only under the obligation to perform them when they come to his hand, as it is written, <i>If thou meet thine enemy’s ox</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 23, 4.</i> <i>If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 5.</i> <i>If a bird’s nest chance to be before thee</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 22, 6.</i><i> When thou buildest a new house</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 8.</i> But as for peace [it is written], <i>Seek peace, and pursue it</i>—everywhere.<br>It has been taught: [The letters of the word] <i>shalom</i>, ‘peace’, have the numerical value of three hundred and seventy-six and [that number] is indicated by the letters <i>sh w ‘a</i> which form a verb meaning ‘to cry for help’. This teaches that the prayer of one who pursues peace does not go unanswered. If so, when [the name] is written ‘Esau’,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Which also has the numerical value 376.</i> is it [an indication of] peace?

But how is it with greeting them first?

L.

And as for greeting them first, it is prohibited in all cases. As for an adulterer and his friends, should they greet one in public their salutation is returned out of respect for the public.

<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">In V the Baraitha and Gemara are intermingled. They have been separated for the sake of clarity.</i> Be not like a large door which lets in the wind<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">‘Wind’ signifies pride: do not be haughty.

[‘Be not like a small door’]: Be not impatient, because [impatience] alienates you from your fellow-men. ‘Be like a lower sill’: If a house has no lower sill it appears like a defective [or] deserted [building]; so must you be meek. Even if you possess all other virtues but lack humility, you are a defective person; for people will say, ‘So-and-so would be a great man but for his pride’. To teach you that it is so, [Scripture declares,] <i>For he that feareth God shall discharge himself of them all</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 7, 18.</i> Raba said: In the same way that the sill guides the doors to close and open, so humility is a fence to wisdom.
<small>BARAITHA</small>. And be like a lower peg on which all hang [their belongings].<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">The remainder of the Baraitha is printed by V within brackets. It is omitted here because it recurs and is commented upon later in the chapter.</i><br><small>GEMARA</small>. Be not a passionate man since nobody will be able to ask questions of you;<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Aboth II, 6 (Sonc. ed., II, 5, p. 15): ‘Nor can a passionate man teach’.</i> for you know not the day of your passing [from the world] and your name will not be remembered. It is written in the book of Ben Sira:<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">Not found in the extant texts of Sirach; cf. Schechter, J.Q.R., III, p. 697.</i> Remember the day of your passing, remove [your] reproach and gather merits, for on the day of a man’s passing neither possessions nor great strength accompany him, but only his [good] deeds go straight before him and his righteousness makes his eyes to shine.
<small>BARAITHA</small>. If you have suffered monetary loss, remember Job who suffered both monetary loss and also [suffered] in his body.<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

B.B. 15b (Sonc. ed., p. 74). Therefore no lesson is to be learnt from him.</i> then there is [the instance of] Dathan and Abiram who suffered both a monetary loss and also in their bodies.
<small>BARAITHA</small>. Do not stumble through your eyes, for stumbling is only due to the eyes.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. j.Ber. I, 5, 3<small>C</small>: ‘The eye and heart are the two agents of sin’.</i><br><small>GEMARA</small>.

[Cf. on the subject, Bamberger, <i>Fallen Angels</i>, pp. 178ff.]</i> stumbled through their eyes; as it is stated, <i>The sons of God saw the daughters of men</i><sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 6, 2.</i>. What did they do? At the Creation they spoke before the All-merciful, <i>‘What is man, that Thou art mindful of him?’</i><sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 8, 5.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, replied, ‘You will see that you will err more than they’. He caused the evil inclination to hold sway over them and they descended [to earth]. And what if they were possessed of the evil inclination, what benefit did they derive from their association [with the daughters of men]? If you argue thus, how will you explain what is written <i>And they bore children to them?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 6, 4.</i> Since [the minds of the women] were concentrated on the angels when they cohabited with their husbands, the result was that their children resembled angels.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">There was no physical contact between the angels and women.</i>
<small>BARAITHA</small>. Do not incur shame from your teeth by overeating.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. This refers to the evil inclination; and so Scripture declares, <i>Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 25, 19.</i> Perhaps the Baraitha speaks of the eating of stolen food?<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">And has no reference to sexual desire.</i> [If it is argued,] It cannot enter your mind that the Baraitha alludes to sin, because if it did it should have taught ‘lest thou come to sin’!<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of ‘by over-eating’.</i> [the reply is,] It uses a euphemism, as it is written, <i>She eateth, and wipeth her mouth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 30, 20, where <i>eateth</i> clearly denotes sexual sin.</i>
<small>BARAITHA</small>. Inquire not about heresy lest you be drawn into Gehinnom.<br><small>GEMARA</small>.

Because of heresy it is written, <i>None that go unto her return</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 2, 19, where the seductive woman is understood as typifying the lure of heretical ideas.</i> You should therefore know that the Holy One, blessed be He, created both the Garden of Eden and Gehinnom; the Garden of Eden is incomplete without the righteous and Gehinnom is incomplete without the wicked.
<small>BARAITHA</small>. If others attribute to you a great evil let it be small in your eyes.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Even if the allegation be serious let it be small [in your eyes], and if it be slight [regard it] as if it were nothing at all. In that event a man will never clear himself of suspicion! And it is written, <i>And Hannah answered and said: No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit</i>, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">1 Sam. 1, 15. Hannah defended herself against the charge of drunkenness and did not ignore it.</i> From this [it is to be learnt] that a person under suspicion must free himself from it! [The Baraitha] uses the phrase ‘in your eyes’, but not so [in the eyes of your neighbours].<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">Where the suspicion is only known to him, he should either minimize or ignore it; but when it has become known to a third party, he must make an effort to clear himself.</i>
<small>BARAITHA</small>. And if you have attributed a minor evil to others let it be serious in your eyes.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. It deals here with honourable men, for if [it dealt with] dissolute men what do they care? But it has been taught: We should expose hypocrites<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Yoma 86b (Sonc. ed., p. 431).</i> [and this should be done] even on the Sabbath. If so, the earlier statement<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. Baraitha 11.</i> must also refer to honourable and not dissolute men! But R. Simeon said: Never in my life has the curse of my fellow gone up with me upon my bed!<sup class="footnote-marker">103</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Meg. 28a (Sonc. ed., p. 168), a statement of R.

<small>BARAITHA</small>. Until you go and appease him.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. This statement supports R. Hamnunah who said:<sup class="footnote-marker">105</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ber. 31b (Sonc. ed., p. 192) where the text is in the name of R. Eleazar and reads ‘to bless him’; V has ‘to appease him’.</i> [If one wrongly suspected another, he must conciliate him;] nay more, he must bless him. No, [it is no support]. There [in the teaching of R. Hamnunah it speaks of a case] when he meets his fellow by chance, but here [in the Baraitha it speaks of his] going [to appease him]. There are others who say: There is a difference here with R. Hamnunah [who can reply:] Should he not find him, he goes [searching] after him.
<small>BARAITHA</small>. Let not your adolescence be sinful, for such is not<sup class="footnote-marker">106</sup><i class="footnote">The negative is omitted by V but included in DEZ.</i> praise of the Torah.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. For the Torah declared, <i>Remember then thy Creator in the days of thy youth, before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say: I have no pleasure in them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">107</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 12, 1.</i> And it further states, <i>Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">108</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. 9, 16.</i> And what means ‘not praise of the Torah’? Some say: The decrepit old man withholds himself from what he can no longer do, but in his youth he was a sinner.
<small>BARAITHA</small>. Let your adolescence be beautiful because that is your praise.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. Since [the previous Baraitha] states, ‘Let not your adolescence be sinful’, it is self-evident that it should be beautiful!<sup class="footnote-marker">109</sup><i class="footnote">The present Baraitha is consequently superfluous</i> No, you might have thought that [during adolescence,] one should be in the category neither of the worthy nor the dissolute but in between.
<small>BARAITHA</small>. Love the Torah and honour it.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. ‘Love the Torah.’ Whence have we this? For it is written, <i>Thou shalt love</i> [<i>’eth</i>] <i>the Lord thy God</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">110</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 6, 3; <i>’eth</i> is the sign of the accusative case.</i> <i>’eth</i> [being added] to include love of the Torah. Similarly you may quote, <i>Honour</i> [<i>’eth</i>] <i>thy father</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">111</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20, 12.</i> where <i>’eth</i> [is added to include] your stepmother; <i>and</i> [<i>we’eth</i>]<i> thy mother</i> to include your stepfather; [or] <i>we-</i> [<i>and</i>] to include your elder brother.<sup class="footnote-marker">112</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Keth. 103a (Sonc. ed., p. 657).</i> What is ‘love’ and what is ‘honour’? ‘Love’ is with the heart and ‘honour’ with deeds. And [is ‘honour’] not with words? It has been taught: He who speaks against the Torah and against the disciples of the wise has no share in the World to Come! Say that [‘honour’] is also with words.
<small>BARAITHA</small>. Subordinate your will to the will of your neighbour, for so Rachel acted towards Leah and David towards Saul.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. As it is written, <i>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">113</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 29, 12.</i> But was he not the son of her father’s sister? What it means is this: He said to her, ‘Will you marry me?’ She replied, ‘I have a sister who is older than I and [my father] will marry her to you because he is a trickster’. He said, ‘I am a trickster like him’; as it is stated, <i>With the merciful Thou dost show Thyself merciful … and with the crooked Thou dost show Thyself subtle</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">114</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 18, 26f.</i> So he gave her a token.<sup class="footnote-marker">115</sup><i class="footnote">By which Laban’s fraud would be exposed.</i> When [Laban] brought Leah [to the bridal chamber], Rachel said, ‘Now she will be put to shame’.

Chapter 6

Ben ‘Azzai said:<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Aboth III, 1 (Sonc. ed., p. 26) where a similar teaching is given by ‘Aḳabya b. Mahalalel.</i> Whoever keeps four things before his eyes will never sin again, viz. whence he came, whither he goes, what will become of him, and Who will be his Judge. Whence he came: from a putrefying secretion, from a place which the eye cannot see. And whither he goes: to a place of darkness and deep gloom. And what will become of him: worms and maggots. And Who will be his Judge: the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He. R. Simeon said: He came from a place of defilement, he came from a place of uncleanness and is destined to defile others. He came from a putrefying secretion and goes to a place of worms and maggots, as it is stated, <i>How much less man, that is worm! and the son of man, that is a maggot!</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Job 25, 6.</i> R. Eliezer b. Jacob said: <i>Man</i>, that is maggot in his lifetime, alluding to vermin; <i>and the son of man</i>, that is worm in his death. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Man is beautiful and splendid, but he brings forth from his inwards something that the eye cannot [bear to] see. To what can this be compared? To a human king who built a large, beautiful and magnificent palace through which a stream of water from a tannery flowed. Every passer-by exclaimed, ‘How beautiful would this palace be but for the stream from the tannery flowing through it!’ So it is with man who resembles [that palace]. Even when he brings forth from his inwards something disgusting which the eye cannot [bear to] see he prides himself before the All-present.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">H adds: ‘So if he produced sweet odours and precious oil, how much more would he pride himself over creatures!’ [Cf. ARN, p. 11.]</i>
When R. Eliezer was dying, his disciples came and sat down before him and said to him, ‘Our teacher, teach us a law’. He replied, ‘What shall I teach you? Go forth and be mindful of each other’s honour; and when you pray know before Whom you stand, for through this you will enter into the life of the World to Come’. R. Eleazar b. Azariah said: Five things did R. Eleazar teach us when he was dying, and gladdened us with them more than with what he taught us during his lifetime, viz. the ball, the shoemaker’s last, the amulet, the phylactery, and a round cushion; be mindful of these and immerse them [for purification] just as they are, because they are established laws which were commanded to Moses on Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf. ARN, p. 108, where this passage is explained.]</i>
<small>GEMARA</small>. What does Ben ‘Azzai mean by his statement, ‘Whoever takes four things to heart will never sin’? Raba said: The divine attribute of Mercy<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">A circumlocution for ‘God’.</i> has four qualities and so too has Satan. Whoever sets his heart on four things is a sinner, viz. wealth, woman, the evil inclination and strife. It is necessary [to enumerate them all]. If it [only] cited ‘woman’, I might have said that it is because of the prohibition of a married woman, a <i>niddah</i> or a Gentile woman;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">V wrongly ‘idolatry’.</i> therefore it adds ‘the evil inclination’ to include all prohibited unions. If it [only] cited ‘the evil inclination’, I might have said that this only holds good when he is unmarried, but where he has a wife [there need be] no [concern about the evil inclination]. Therefore [it is made clear] that even when he has a wife it is prohibited [to neglect this] lest something forbidden chances to come his way [and he sins]. If it [only] cited ‘the evil inclination’, I might have said that the prohibition holds good only where it concerns his person but not where money [is involved], therefore it adds ‘riches’. And if it [only] cited ‘riches’, I might have said that it is because it concerns money but not if it was connected with strife.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘the tongue’.</i> Therefore it was necessary [to enumerate them all].
The question was asked: May one say, ‘Would that I had So-and-so’s money! Would that I had a wife like So-and-so’s wife!’? May one sleep in one bed with his wife who is <i>niddah</i> or not? May one quarrel with a man with whom it is not fit to quarrel? Come and hear and I will answer all these questions. It is stated, <i>Thou shalt not covet:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20, 17, in A.J. 14.</i> even [by saying,] ‘Would that I had So-and-so’s money!’ To say, ‘Would that I had So-and-so’s money!’ is [the conduct of] a thief or a robber. But [as for the remark], ‘Would that I had as much money as So-and-so!’ why should this be definitely forbidden? He only expresses a wish for himself! But [to say], ‘Would that So-and-so gave me his money!’ constitutes an act of coveting. ‘Would that I had a wife like the wife of So-and-so!’—[by saying this he indicates that] he has already impure thoughts concerning her; but to say ‘Would that the daughter of So-and-so would marry me!’ is certainly permissible. Is not this self-evident? It is necessary [to state this because] he may say to her, ‘Be betrothed to me’ and she may refuse. ‘May one sleep in one bed with his wife who is <i>niddah?</i>’ [It is stated,] <i>And thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness, as long as she is impure by her uncleanness</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 18, 19.</i> He is allowed, however, to eat with her. Whoever approaches his wife<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Add with H ‘who is <i>niddah’</i>, which is implied.</i> while she is asleep is as if he approached a ship which is about to be wrecked in the sea.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">He is heading for a sin against the Torah.</i> Here it is written, <i>And thou shalt not approach</i>, and there it is written, <i>So the shipmaster came to him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Jonah 1, 6. The Heb. for <i>came to</i> is the same as for <i>approach</i>. The context is the danger to the ship in which Jonah was sailing.</i> Some say that he is obliged to bring a sin-offering, as it is written, <i>The soul that sinneth, it shall die</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Ezek. 18, 20. This sentence is omitted in H. The point appears to be this: The word <i>sinneth</i> is <span dir="rtl">הַחׄטֵאת</span>, which is written without the <i>waw</i> and can be read <span dir="rtl">הַחַטָאת</span>, ‘the sin-offering’. Since Ezekiel, in verse 6, mentions [coming] <i>near to a woman in her impurity</i>, by the rule of analogy it is concluded that such a sin can only be atoned by a sin-offering.</i> Some say: It is as if he offered sacrifices to the Golden Calf.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">H adds Ex. 32, 19, as the proof-text where <i>came nigh</i> occurs, which in Heb. is the same as <i>approached</i>.</i> ‘May one quarrel with a man with whom it is not fit to quarrel?’ It is written, <i>And I contended with them, and cursed them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Neh. 13, 25.

We have learnt there:<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Ḥag. 11b (Sonc. ed., p. 59).</i> Whoever speculates upon four things, it were better<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Ḥag. reads ‘pity’ instead of ‘see’ (<i>loc. cit.</i>, n. 5).</i> for him had he not come into the world, viz.: What is above, what is beneath, what is before, what is after.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">These terms have a temporal significance as to what happened before the Creation and what will happen in the hereafter. For another interpretation, cf. <i>loc. cit.</i>, nn. 6-8.</i> This may be compared with the statement, ‘Not only does he pride himself over his fellow-creatures but also over his Creator’. If being of unclean limbs he rebels against his Creator, how much more so if a perfumed odour filled him! This is what the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Hiram, king of Tyre,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. B.B. 75a (Sonc. ed., p. 302). Ezek. 28 is addressed against the Prince of Tyre, identified in the Talmud with king Hiram.

‘When R.

Even the salutation of a king it is forbidden to return,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ber. 30b (Sonc. ed., p. 187).</i> but in the case of the <i>Shema‘</i> he returns the salutation when [the king] comes early to his door.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>ibid.</i> 14a (Sonc. ed., p. 81). The meaning is doubtful. Perhaps the intention is to state an extreme case. Should the king come to the house of a subject early, indicating most important business, when the latter is reciting the <i>Shema‘</i>, the greeting may be returned.</i>
‘Five things’, etc.: ‘A round cushion’. Why?<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Why is not their stuffing removed before immersion?</i> For it is written, <i>Woe to the women that sew cushions upon all elbows, and make pads for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls!</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Ezek. 13, 18.</i> Here <i>cushions</i> are compared with <i>pads</i> [<i>mispaḥoth</i>]: just as a ‘scab’ [<i>sapaḥath</i>] is clean, as it is written, <i>Then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is a scab</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 13, 6.</i> so too is a cushion clean.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the stuffing in it need not be removed before the cushion is immersed.</i><br>The Rabbis taught:<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Sanh. 68a (Sonc. ed., p. 462). [The story is related in ARN, p. 124ff.]</i> When R. Eliezer fell sick, all the wise men of Israel came to visit him. That day was the Sabbath-eve and he was wearing his <i>tefillin</i>. His son entered to remove them from him,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Because they are not worn on the Sabbath.</i> but he rebuked him and drove him away in anger. [The son] said to the wise men, ‘I believe that my father’s mind is deranged’. Whereupon [R. Eliezer] exclaimed, ‘His mind and that of his mother are deranged but my mind is not’. As he was dying, he put two of his fingers together and said, ‘Woe to me because of these two Scrolls of the Torah!<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The parallel passage in Sanh. adds: ‘that are wrapped up’, so that they cannot be read.

My disciples have only extracted little from me like a painting-stick from its tube.

Moreover, I have studied three hundred laws on the subject of a deep bright spot<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">One of the symptoms of leprosy (Lev. 13, 2).</i> and three hundred established laws<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. decisions arrived at after discussion.</i> derived from the verse, <i>Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 22, 17.</i> and no man, excepting ‘Aḳiba b. Joseph, ever questioned me thereon’ [54<i>a</i>].<br>The master said, ‘Like a dog lapping from the sea’—he compared himself to a dog! He said it with reference to his disciples. And why to his disciples? Because they did not visit him during his illness; and it has been taught: He said concerning them, ‘I will be surprised if they die a natural death’.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Sanh. <i>loc. cit.</i></i>
The Rabbis taught: When a Sage dies, all the people have the duty to mourn for him, as it is written, <i>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">1 Sam. 28, 3.</i> and it is also written, <i>And Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together, and lamented him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XXV, 1.</i> Since it states <i>all Israel</i>, it is self-evident that they <i>gathered themselves together!</i> First they mourned for him in the cities and people said, ‘Is this [sufficient] honour for Samuel who journeyed from city to city and from province to province to teach us Torah?’, something which no other prophet had done; as it is said, <i>And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el and Gilgal and Miẓpah; and he judged Israel in all those places. And his return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there he judged Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> VII, 16f. Therefore it states, <i>And all Israel gathered themselves together</i>, i.e. there was a united national mourning.</i> Raba said: Greater was their preoccupation [with mourning] in the case of Samuel than in that of Moses. Of Moses it is written, <i>And the children of Israel wept for Moses</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 34, 8.</i> but here it is written, <i>And all Israel … lamented him</i>—even the women, slaves and minors.
We have learnt there:<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Sanh. 71b (Sonc. ed., p. 488).</i> The assembling of the righteous benefits themselves and the world; the scattering of the righteous harms them and the world.

The Rabbis taught:<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Shab. 33b (Sonc. ed., p. 155).</i> What reason did the righteous Isaiah see for saying, <i>The righteous perisheth?</i> It means to say that the righteous man is made responsible<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. suffer.</i> for the sins of his generation; as R. Gorion said: When there are righteous in a generation, they are made responsible for the sins of their generation; when there are no righteous in a generation the schoolchildren are made responsible for the generation. The master said: ‘The righteous man is made responsible for the sins of his generation’. He abandoned the [plain] interpretation of the verse and gave it his own interpretation!

The man turned back to them and asked, ‘Who is he [whom you call] Rabbi?’ They replied, ‘He who is following behind you’. Whereupon he remarked, ‘If he is a Rabbi, may there be no more like him in Israel’. His disciples by whom he was beloved rebuked the man and asked him, ‘What has he done to you?’ He replied, ‘Thus has he done to me’. They said to him, ‘Nevertheless forgive him’.<br>Be tender like the reed and do not be hard like the cedar. When the four winds of heaven blow, the reed bends with them, and when they subside, the reed remains standing in its place. Therefore the reed merited that of it the pen should be made wherewith to write the words of the Torah. Not so the cedar: when the south [or] north wind blows, it overturns and uproots it. And what is the end of the cedar? Woodcutters come and shape it and tile houses with it, and its cuttings they burn in the fire.
In which way should one honour his teacher? When the two of them walk together in the road, he should place himself on [the teacher’s] right hand and not on his left. If there be three, the Sage should be in the middle, the older man on his right and the younger on his left. For so we find it with the three Ministering Angels, Gabriel, Michael and Raphael, who came to our father Abraham. Gabriel was in the middle, Michael on his right and Raphael on his left. When they came to Abraham, the Divine Presence also came and stood above his head. He said to them, ‘Sirs, wait until I have taken leave of the Divine Presence, Who is greater than you’, as it is stated, <i>And He left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 17, 22.</i> As soon as Abraham had taken leave of the Divine Presence, he came and bowed to them, as it is stated, <i>And when he saw them, he ran to meet them … and bowed down to the earth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XVIII, 2.</i> He led them beneath the tree and said to them, ‘Sirs, <i>let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and recline yourselves under the tree</i>’,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 4.</i> and then, <i>I will fetch a morsel of bread and stay ye your heart</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 5.</i> But what did Lot say to them? <i>Tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your way</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XIX, 2.</i> Others say: Lot surely spoke with the wisdom of the wise.

It is related of the four elders, Rabban Gamaliel, R. Joshua, R. Eleazar b. Azariah and R. ‘Aḳiba, that they once journeyed to a kingdom in the interior where they had<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>wehayah</i> instead of <i>we’amar</i>.</i> a friend who was a philosopher. R. Joshua said to Rabban Gamaliel, ‘I will go and pay my respects to our friend, the philosopher’. He replied, ‘No’. He again said, ‘I will go and pay my respects to our friend, the philosopher’. He replied, ‘Go in peace’. In the morning at cock-crow they went and stood at the door of the philosopher’s house. As Rabban Gamaliel was knocking at the door, the philosopher was thinking to himself and saying, ‘This<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The knocking on the door.</i> can only be the good manners of wise men’. He knocked a second time, and the philosopher rose up, washed his hands and feet. [Rabban Gamaliel knocked] a third time, and the philosopher saw the wise men of Israel had come some from one side and some from the other, with Rabban Gamaliel in the middle, R. Eleazar b. Azariah on his right and R. ‘Aḳiba on his left. The philosopher debated with himself, ‘How shall I greet the wise men of Israel? If I say, “Peace be upon you Rabban Gamaliel” I will offend the wise men of Israel. If I say, “Peace be upon you, O wise men of Israel” I will offend Rabban Gamaliel’. When he approached them he exclaimed, ‘Peace be upon you, headed by Rabban Gamaliel’. [This rule of good manners we learn] not from Rabban Gamaliel but from the Almighty; as it is stated, <i>I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on His left</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">1 Kings 22, 19.</i><br>One who accompanies his teacher may not depart from him until he has withdrawn backwards a little and asked his permission. If they are two scholars of equal status, the host enters [the house] first and the guest after him. And when they leave, the guest goes out first and the host after him. One who takes leave of his teacher, whether he be his senior or not, should say, ‘I [ask permission] to take my leave’.

Because <i>they have not kept My law;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">One cause was the effect of the other, and so there were not two causes.</i> consequently if they had kept My law they would not have forsaken Me. And as to your question on [the destruction of] the Second Temple, causeless hatred is different because it is more grievous than idolatry.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Hence one cause sufficed.</i> Whence do we know this?

‘He is called friend’ of the Divine Presence,<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Midrash Rabbah, Exodus, XXVII, 1 (Sonc. ed., p. 321): ‘<i>Thine own friend</i> (Prov. 27, 10) is the Holy One, blessed be He’.</i> as it is written. <i>For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say: Peace be within thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 122, 8.</i> ‘Beloved’, as it is written, <i>I love them that love me, and those that seek me earnestly shall find me</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 8, 17.</i> ‘One who gladdens the All-present and his fellow-creatures’: This teaches that a man should appear justified before his fellow-creatures as well as before the Holy One, blessed be He, as it is written, <i>Then ye shall be clear before the Lord, and before Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 32, 22.</i> ‘Gladden the All-present’: as it is written, <i>Behold, this is the joy of his way</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">Job 8, 19 interpreted of God.</i> [‘Gladden] his fellow-creatures’: as it is written, <i>Israel, in whom I will be glorified</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">Isa. 49, 3.</i><br>‘It clothes him with meekness’: Who taught this? R. Joshua b. Levi who said:<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. ‘A.Z. 20b (Sonc. ed., p. 107).</i> Meekness is the greatest of them all. Since the last part reads ‘R.

Something is missing in the Baraitha and read it as follows: ‘[Meekness is] the greatest of them all, <i>and further</i> said R. Joshua b. Levi’. But perhaps the author of the statement is R. Meir? We do not find anywhere that R. Meir said, ‘Reverence is best’.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">The word ‘reverence’ seems to be an error for ‘meekness’, otherwise the answer is unintelligible. [Because in the Baraitha ‘reverence’ is linked with ‘meekness’, the answer may be that since R. Meir nowhere makes the statement with respect to the first, it cannot be his statement.]</i><br>‘It fits him to be righteous, pious’, etc. What is meant by ‘righteous’ and what by ‘pious’? ‘Righteous’ is one who does right actions; ‘pious’ is one who practises acts of loving-kindness. Since [the Baraitha] cites these [virtues], why does it mention ‘upright [and faithful]’? ‘Upright’ means one who is upright in his ways, ‘faithful’ denotes one who is faithful in spirit.<br>‘It keeps him far from sin’: even from the sin of others. ‘And brings him near to merit’: even the merit of others. ‘From him men enjoy sound knowledge’: What is meant by <i>tushiyyah?</i> The Torah. And why is it called <i>tushiyyah?</i> Because it weakens the strength of a man<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sanh. 26b (Sonc. ed., p. 155) where the word is derived from the root <span dir="rtl">תשש</span>, ‘to weaken’.</i> [through his constant study of it]. Another explanation: Because it was given in secret on account of Saṭan.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sanh. <i>loc. cit.</i> Saṭan opposed the Torah being given to Moses because he argued that the Israelites would later violate it by worshipping the Golden Calf. Cf. Shab. 89a, Tosafoth <i>s.v.

Come and hear: [It is written,] <i>He frustrated the devices of the crafty, so that their hands can perform nothing substantial</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Job 5, 12, where <i>substantial</i> is <i>tushiyyah</i> in the Heb.</i> It is all right in this last-quoted verse where it is clear from what is written, <i>so that their hands can perform nothing</i>, that it refers to what they have begun to do; but on the basis of the first statement there is a difficulty!<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">If study weakens a man and so he fails to achieve his purpose, there is no incentive to study.</i> [It can be answered that] on the basis of the first statement there is also no difficulty, because anxiety<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘thought’ about one’s livelihood.</i> affects one’s learning.<sup class="footnote-marker">100</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘the Torah’. God frees scholars from anxiety by providing them with sustenance, because otherwise they could not progress in their studies. The verse from Job is accordingly understood in this sense: ‘He abolisheth the thoughts of the skilled (i.e. scholars), lest their hands perform nothing substantial’. Cf. Sanh. 26b (Sonc. ed., p. 155, n. 11).</i> And as for him who interprets [<i>tushiyyah</i>] ‘because it was given in secret on account of Saṭan’, there is a twofold difficulty: first, the word cannot bear such an interpretation, and secondly the verses [which are cited] afford no proof<sup class="footnote-marker">101</sup><i class="footnote">Reading with H <i>menaher</i>, ‘enlighten’</i> for it! The difficulty certainly [remains unsolved].<br>‘<i>Counsel is Mine, and sound wisdom</i>’—thus declared the princes of the Torah: <i>Mine is counsel and sound wisdom</i>, and [the Torah] responded, <i>I am understanding</i>. Or if you wish I can say that [the Torah] declared, ‘Although [understanding] is not my relative,<sup class="footnote-marker">102</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the source of my wisdom (so L.

‘R. Joshua b. Levi said: Every day’, etc. Whence do we know this?

<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This Baraitha is derived mainly from DER VI.</i><small>BARAITHA</small>. One should not take leave of his teacher or his friend without receiving permission. This rule of good manners all men may learn from the All-present, Who stood at the entrance of the Garden [of Eden] and called to Adam, as it is stated, <i>And the Lord God called unto the man</i> [<i>’Adam</i>], <i>and said unto him: Where art thou?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 3, 9. God was about to part from Adam (cf. <i>ibid.</i> 24).</i><br>One should not be impatient during his meal. It is reported of Hillel that once a man came to have a meal with him, when a poor person arrived and, standing at the door of his house, said to his wife, ‘I am to be married today and I have no food’. She took the entire meal and gave it to him. Then she went and kneaded fresh dough, cooked another meal and came in and placed it before them. [Hillel] said to her, ‘My dear, why did you not bring this sooner?’ She told him what had happened; whereupon he said, ‘My dear, I did not judge you in the scale of guilt but in the scale of merit, because all your deeds are for the sake of Heaven’.<br>
Let all persons always be in your eyes as robbers, but honour each with the respect due to Rabban Gamaliel.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">A Patriarch of Palestine and eminent teacher (1st cent. <small>C.E.</small>) of whom it was said, ‘When he died the honour of the Torah ceased, and purity and piety became extinct’ (Soṭah IX, 15, Sonc. ed., p. 266).</i> It is related of R. Joshua that he extended hospitality [to all]. A man arrived to whom he gave food and drink, took up to the attic and then removed the ladder from under him. What did the man do? He arose in the middle of the night, spread out his cloak, took the vessels [belonging to the room] which he wrapped in his cloak and was about to descend when he fell and broke his collar-bone. In the morning R. Joshua came and, finding him [on the ground], said to him, ‘You worthless person, do men act like you?’ He replied, ‘I did not know that you had removed the ladder from under me’. He said to him, ‘Were you not aware that we were on our guard against you since yesterday?’
Guests who are received in a house should do whatever the host bids them do. It is related of Simeon b. Anṭipaṭros that once guests came to him and he bade them eat and drink; but they, vowing and swearing in the name of the Torah, [declined to do so]. When they were about to depart, he administered to them forty lashes. On hearing of this, the Sages were angered<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Or, according to H’s reading, ‘puzzled’.</i> by the incident and asked, ‘Who will find out for us why he did this?’ R. Joshua said to them, ‘I will go’. They said, ‘Go in peace’. He went and found [Simeon] sitting at the door of his house, and said to him, ‘Peace be upon you’, to which he answered, ‘Come in peace’, and asked him, ‘Is there anything you want?’ He replied, ‘A place to lodge’. [He said to him, ‘Sit down in peace’.]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Added by H.</i> The two of them sat down and occupied themselves with the study of the Torah until the evening. [In the morning he said to him,]<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Added by H.</i> ‘Do you wish that we go to the bath-house?’ He replied, ‘As you wish’. [Simeon] said to him, ‘Sit down’, and he sat. As time went on, R. Joshua was afraid lest he would beat him upon his shoulders. [After they had finished eating and drinking,]<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">So H. V reads: ‘he eventually parted from him in peace’, which is clearly out of place.</i> he said to [Simeon], ‘Who will accompany me?’ He replied, ‘I will’.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Again V inserts wrongly, ‘eventually he went away in peace’.</i> Now R. Joshua was turning things over in his mind, saying to himself, ‘What answer shall I give to the scholars who sent me?’ He turned round and [Simeon] asked him [55<i>a</i>], ‘Why have you turned round?’ ‘There is something which I must ask you’, he said. ‘Why do you beat men who come to you, but me you have not beaten?’ He answered, ‘Rabbi, you are a great scholar and possessed of good manners.

He replied, ‘I command you that you should give them twice forty [lashes], forty for me and forty for you’. R. Joshua then went and reported to the Sages what he had seen in connection with the son of Anṭipaṭros.<br><small>GEMARA</small>. ‘Let all persons always be suspect in your eyes as robbers.’ But it is not so!

Further, there<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">In the quotation from Ned.</i> it is the host who makes the vow, but here<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">In the Baraitha.</i> it is the guest as is evidenced by the words, ‘Whatever the host bids them do’.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">How was the guest to know beforehand what the host would bid him do?

But how can Beth Hillel [say of a bride] that she is beautiful when in fact she is not? [Beth Hillel can reply that in the circumstances people will understand it as] beautiful in her deeds and graceful in her person because we do not presume [to attribute to a person] what is unbecoming.

Since you mention <i>the innocent</i> [may not be slain], obviously the <i>righteous</i> [may not]!<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The term <i>innocent</i> has a negative connotation, viz. one who keeps away from evil; but the term <i>righteous</i> has both a negative and positive connotation, viz. one who keeps away from evil and does good.</i> [It denotes] ‘innocent because of witnesses’ and ‘righteous because of disciples’.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">These are forensic terms. I. Where two witnesses testify against a man that he had committed an offence but disagree on the details, the accused is discharged. E.g., two witnesses testify that they saw him worshipping idols; one says that he worshipped the sun and the other that it was the moon. Because the witnesses are in disagreement on details, the man is acquitted. He is technically termed <i>naḳi me‘edim</i>, ‘innocent (or, freed) because of [the disagreement of] witnesses’. II. In the criminal court young scholars sat in rows in front of the judges. When the trial ended and before the verdict was delivered, any one of these scholars could, if he knew anything in favour of the accused, come forward and speak for him, and if the judges accepted his statement they discharged the accused. He was then termed <i>ẓaddiḳ min hattalmidim</i>, ‘righteous (i.e. acquitted) because of the disciples’. If the disciple wished to testify against the accused, he was not permitted to do so. That would be a case of <i>rasha‘ min hattalmidim</i>, ‘condemned because of the disciples’, which was not allowed. Cf.

He prepared for them four beds, laid an abundant meal before them and gave them wine to drink. They said, ‘We discern that this wine [has the flavour of]the dead’. He brought them meat and they said, ‘This meat is dog’s flesh’. He brought them pickle and they said, ‘It contains urine’. He brought them mustard and they said, ‘It contains beetles’. [The host] went to the tavern-keeper and asked, ‘What happened to the wine?’ He replied, ‘Nothing’. He said, ‘I adjure you to tell me’. He replied, ‘The wine comes from my father’s vineyard where he is buried’. He went to the butcher who told him, ‘It was the meat of a lamb whose dam died and I made her suck from a bitch’. He went to the pickle-maker who told him, ‘One night I was drunk and [my family] locked me in. I wanted to pass water but was unable to go out, so I opened this [jar of pickle] and poured the urine into it’. He went to the mustard-maker who told him, ‘One night I left [the mustard] uncovered and beetles got into it’. He then took the trouble to prepare [another] meal for them. They said one to another, ‘We notice that the host’s legs are like those of a clown’. The host overheard this and said [to himself], ‘Perhaps these men speak the truth’. So he pretended to be very ill and people came to visit him. He said to his mother, ‘If you disclose to me the name of my father I will recover’. She told him, but he said to her, ‘You are telling a lie’. Since she noticed that he was grieved she said to him, ‘My son, once my husband brought a clown to me; I misconducted myself with him and conceived you’. He went and embraced them, bowed to them and exclaimed, ‘In truth you are the people of the Holy God’. This is what Solomon said, <i>For in much wisdom is much vexation; and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 1, 18.

What is the reason? Because it is written, <i>A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">121</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 12, 10.</i> a beast does regard the life of a righteous man. ‘The earnings of his wife’: for it is written, [<i>And there will be goat’s milk enough</i>] <i>for thy food, for the food of thy household; and maintenance for thy maidens</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">122</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XXVII, 27.</i> The Torah teaches that your food comes before the food of your household,<sup class="footnote-marker">123</sup><i class="footnote">In Rabbinic phraseology the Biblical term ‘house’ is equated with one’s wife; cf.

Raba said: Whoever compels his wife or his household to work, the evil inclination departs from them;<sup class="footnote-marker">124</sup><i class="footnote">Being fully occupied, they will have no time to indulge in wrong.</i> as it is stated, <i>The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are secure as a young lion</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">125</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 28, 1.</i> This conforms to what we learnt:<sup class="footnote-marker">126</sup><i class="footnote">Keth. 59b (Sonc. ed., p. 353).</i> Rabban Simeon b.

<small>BARAITHA</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">130</sup><i class="footnote">Pes. <i>loc. cit.</i></i> Once R. ‘Aḳiba was sitting and expounding beneath an olive-tree and said: They who breed small cattle,<sup class="footnote-marker">131</sup><i class="footnote">e.g. sheep and goats.</i> they who cut down beautiful trees,<sup class="footnote-marker">132</sup><i class="footnote">To dispose of them for timber.</i> and they who teach young children but do not do their work conscientiously will not see a sign of blessing.<br><small>GEMARA</small>.

There<sup class="footnote-marker">134</sup><i class="footnote">In the statement of R. Ḥanina.</i> it speaks of other kinds of trees and here of olive-trees. Deduce this from what [the Baraitha] teaches, ‘He was sitting beneath an olive-tree’. Why [an olive-tree]? Because the blessing [which it provides] is great and yet the man comes and cuts it down! [I quote against that reasoning] the first clause, ‘They who breed small cattle’! If it is because they are a blessing, why do they not see [a sign of blessing]? The text should read, ‘They who slaughter [small cattle]’.
