Tractate Mezuzah



Chapter 1

It is not permitted to write <i>mezuzoth</i> on the skins of ritually unclean cattle or on skins of ritually unclean wild animals. It is permitted, however, to write them on skins of <i>nebeloth</i> and <i>ṭerefoth</i>, and there is no need to consider the possibility of their having been pierced at the animal’s heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">There was a heathen practice to remove the heart from an animal while it was still alive and offer it as a sacrifice. Rabbinic law regards such an animal as an idolatrous offering (cf. Mishnah ‘A.Z. 29b, Sonc. ed., p. 145) and forbids its entire use, including the skin.</i>
It is required to leave [a space of] one line on every side [of the text of the <i>mezuzah</i>], according to R. Simeon b. Eleazar.
If a hole was made in the place of the script it is unfit for religious use; but if it occurred in the margin it remains fit.<br>If the letter <i>waw</i> [in a <i>mezuzah</i>] was shaped like a <i>zayin</i> or <i>vice versa</i>, curved letters like straight-lined letters<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">e.g. an ordinary <i>kaf</i> like the final <i>kaf.</i></i> or <i>vice versa</i>, open letters closed<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">An ordinary <i>mem</i> like the final <i>mem.</i></i> or <i>vice versa</i>, or if the shape of its letters had been altered [in any other way], or if it was written in [obsolete] Hebrew, it is unfit for religious use.
A magazine for straw, a wood-shed [and any] storage room are exempt [from the <i>mezuzah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Only dwelling-houses are subject to the obligation.</i> A stable for cattle is exempt, but if women make use of it<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In which to adorn themselves; but if they use any of the structures for bathing it is exempt (cf. Yoma 11a, Sonc. ed., p. 48; Y.D. CCLXXXVI, §2).</i> it is liable. Cone-shaped huts,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">[Used by watchers in a field or by hunters; Krauss, <i>Talmudische Archäologie</i>, I, p. 6.]</i> travellers’ stations, field sheds<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">[Krauss, <i>Lehnwörter</i>, p. 226, and <i>Talm. Arch.</i> I, p. 276, n. 81, reads <i>hilaḳṭiyoth</i>. Maimonides understood the term to mean ‘summer-house’, thatched on top and open on the four sides. More probably it was used for stacking hay, etc., where it was dried by the wind.]</i> and tanneries are exempt from <i>mezuzah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">They are not dwelling-houses.</i>
A bath-house is exempt, but if a dwelling-house adjoins it the outer doorway is liable.
A corner doorway that has only one doorpost, [or] a doorway made in [a structure of] boards which has only one doorpost is liable. R. Eliezer b. Jacob declares it exempt.
Arched doorways are exempt, but R. Meir and R. Judah declare that they are liable. All, however, agree that if they have the [usual] structure below<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Being four handbreadths wide and reaching to a height of ten handbreadths (cf. ‘Erub, 11b, Sonc. ed., p. 69).</i> and the arched section above they are liable to <i>mezuzah</i>.
City gates, the gates of open places<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Where people assemble for special prayers or to discuss public matters.</i> and the gates of Temple Courts are exempt.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">[But according to Yoma 11a, Sonc. ed., p. 47, city gates require a <i>mezuzah</i>.]</i> [The doorways of] chambers in the Temple were exempt from <i>mezuzah</i>, but the Chamber of the Counsellors,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>lishkath parhedrin</i>, one of the Temple chambers, in agreement with Yoma 10a (Sonc. ed., p. 45). V and H read: <i>lishkath shel beth happarwah</i>, ‘the chamber of the Parwah house’, Parwah being the name of its Persian builder (cf. <i>ibid.</i> 35a, Sonc. ed., p. 161, n. 6).</i> which served as a residence for the High Priest on seven days in the year,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Before the Day of Atonement (cf. <i>ibid.</i> 2a, Sonc. ed., p. 1).</i> and potters’ booths are subject to <i>mezuzah</i>. R. Jose declares them exempt.

Chapter 2

The <i>mezuzah</i> is placed<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘written’.</i> on the right-hand side of the entrance from the street into the lodge, and [on the right-hand side of] the exit from the courtyard into the lodge.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">It refers to where the lodge is in front of a courtyard and has two doorways, one facing the street and the other facing the courtyard.</i>
If a garden has a doorpost where it adjoins the courtyard, the <i>mezuzah</i> is placed [on the right-hand side of] the exit from the garden into the courtyard; and if a lodge is attached to it,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Between the garden and the courtyard, with doorways leading to each of them.</i> <i>mezuzoth</i> are to be placed on both doorways [of the lodge].
Where small rooms open into a reception room,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Access to which is gained only through the small ones.</i> the <i>mezuzah</i> is placed on that doorway which is customarily used.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">So according to H. V’s reading is corrupt.</i> If they are all customarily used, <i>mezuzoth</i> are placed on all the doorways.
If a number of rooms have doorways leading from one room to the other,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘rooms within one another’.</i> <i>mezuzoth</i> are placed at the entrance of each one of them. R. Judah says: If the ladder is movable on the four sides….<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The sentence is obviously incomplete. H reads: ‘If the ladder is movable a <i>mezuzah</i> is placed at every side’; but this also does not convey much sense.</i>
If a doorway leads from a roof [into a room], the <i>mezuzah</i> is placed [on the right-hand side of] the entrance from the roof. R. Nathan b. R. Jose said: In such a case Beth Shammai hold that the doorway is subject to <i>mezuzah</i> and Beth Hillel hold that it is exempt.
In a booth that is set back<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘within’.</i> from [the edge of] a roof the <i>mezuzah</i> is to be placed [on the right-hand side of] the exit from the booth to the roof. R. Jose says: [On the right-hand side of the entrance] from the roof to the booth.
In the case of a portico that is set back from the rooms and has no other exit,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Except through one of the rooms.</i> the <i>mezuzah</i> is placed [on the right-hand side of] the exit from the portico into the rooms. R. Jose says: [On the right-hand side of] the entrance from the rooms to the portico.
If an entrance serves as two doorways and a wall [of not more than] one handbreath in width [separates them], only one <i>mezuzah</i> is to be affixed, according to R. Judah. [If the wall was] wider than that two <i>mezuzoth</i> are required.
The <i>mezuzah</i> is placed in the upper half of the doorpost;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘from the half and above’. Another reading is: ‘on the upper third’; cf. the ruling in the name of Samuel in Men. 33a (Sonc. ed., p. 208).</i> so R. Meir. R. Judah says: [It should be placed] below the handbreadth [from the top of the doorpost] and above one handbreadth [from the bottom].
If one made a groove in the wall at a distance of [not more than] one handbreadth [from the doorpost], and placed [the <i>mezuzah</i>] in it, the <i>mezuzah</i> is valid. [If the distance] was greater than that it is invalid.<br>If one made a groove in a stick and put the <i>mezuzah</i> in it, it is invalid. If one inserted [the <i>mezuzah</i>] in a tube and hung it up behind the door [or] behind the doorpost,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Hanging the stick on the doorpost.</i> R. Meir declared it valid, but R. Judah declared it invalid.
A new house is subject to the obligation of <i>mezuzah</i> as soon as it is completed.
One who lodges in an inn in the Land of Israel for thirty days is subject to the obligation of <i>mezuzah</i>, and if one rents [a house] he must affix [a <i>mezuzah</i>] forthwith. Outside the Land of Israel, [one who lives in an inn] is exempt, and one who rents [a house] must affix [a <i>mezuzah</i>] after thirty days.
[A Jew] who rents a house from a Gentile or from a Samaritan must affix a <i>mezuzah</i> forthwith, and when he quits he must remove it; but if one rents a house from an Israelite, he affixes the <i>mezuzah</i> forthwith and when he quits he must not remove it.
One who buys a house from a Gentile or a Samaritan is under the obligation of putting a <i>mezuzah</i>, but [if he bought it] from an Israelite it is presumed [to have been provided with the necessary <i>mezuzoth</i>].
If one buys a brick-mould from a Gentile, he should not heat it before he had examined it.<br>[The scroll in] the <i>mezuzah</i> should be examined once in twenty-five years, according to R. Simeon. R. Jacob says: A much longer time [may be allowed to intervene]. Both, however, agree that if it was transferred from one place to another it requires examination.<br>In like manner, water-tanks<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘machines’. H has <i>mogeroth</i>, ‘stores’.</i> in a public domain must be examined once in seven years, but those situated in a private domain once in twenty-five years, according to R. Meir; but the Sages say: In either case the general rule is that wherever there is a top cover<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Reading with H <i>beth</i> instead of V’s <i>bath</i>.</i> the examination takes place once in seven years, and where there is no top cover the examination takes place once in twenty-five years.
