Tractate Semachot

Introduction

<i>And it came to pass at midnight, that the Lord smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 12, 29.</i> etc.; and it is written, <i>For all the first-born among the children of Israel are Mine, both men and beast; on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for Myself</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 8, 17.</i> R. Joḥanan said: Although He smote them with the plague of death at midnight, the souls writhed within them until morning. A common proverb says, ‘If you give a morsel of bread to a child, inform his mother’.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Beẓah 16a (Sonc. ed., p. 81) where it is quoted, not as a proverb, but as a saying of Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel.</i> Likewise, the Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘I will inform My children of the death by choking<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">GRA’s emendation of a verb in the text meaning ‘which silences’.</i> of which their enemies are dying. Let their souls await the morning [before expiring], so that My children shall look upon [the fate of] their enemies’.





Chapter 1

A dying man<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <i>gosēs</i>, the term applied when the rattle in the throat indicates that a person is at the point of death.</i> is regarded as a living entity in respect of all matters in the world: he holds [his brother’s wife] tied to the leviratical marriage,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Deut. 25, 5ff. Should the brother die while he himself is dying, the former’s widow is precluded from marrying until she is released by the latter from his obligation to wed her (cf. Ohol. I, 6, Sonc. ed., pp. 151f).</i> he frees [his mother] from the obligation of a leviratical marriage<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If his father died and left no other children, his mother is free to remarry because the dying man is regarded as living. Even a child who survives one day frees his mother from the levirate. Cf. Nid. 43b (Sonc. ed., p. 303).</i> and enables her to eat <i>terumah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">If his mother is the daughter of a lay-Israelite married to a <i>kohen</i>, she may continue to eat <i>terumah</i> so long as he remains at the point of death.</i> and he [may also] disqualify her from eating <i>terumah;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">If she is the daughter of a <i>kohen</i> married to a lay-Israelite, she may not eat of the <i>terumah</i> belonging to her father which, on the death of her husband, she is permitted to eat when she returns to his home (cf. Lev. 22, 12f). The reason is that, since her son is regarded as living, it would be contrary to the stipulation in Lev. <i>and have no child</i>.</i> he inherits and transmits;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. an estate. On inheritance and transmission, cf. B.B. 108a (Sonc. ed., p. 448).</i> if one of his limbs is severed, it is regarded as a limb cut off from the living;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">There is a legal difference if it is a limb severed from a living or dead body. If it was from a dead body, a piece of flesh from it, even the size of an olive, communicates defilement; but if from a living body it does not. Therefore, if one of the dying man’s limbs is severed, flesh from it does not defile because he is considered a living being.</i> if [part of his] flesh [is severed], it is regarded as flesh cut off from the living;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Flesh not necessarily from a severed limb.</i> and the blood of his sin-offering and guilt-offering is sprinkled for him until the time he dies.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Where a man who brought a sin- or guilt-offering died before it was sacrificed, the animal for the former had to be killed and the latter turned into the fields to graze until it died naturally. But with a dying man who brought an offering, the ritual connected with his sacrifice was carried out completely.</i>
We do not tie up his cheek-bones,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">To prevent the jaw from dropping; cf. Shab. 151a (Sonc. ed., p. 771).</i> or stop up his apertures,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">To prevent air from entering.</i> or place a metal vessel or anything which chills on his navel;<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Shab. <i>loc. cit.</i> reads ‘on his stomach’, that it should not swell.</i> as it is stated, <i>Before the silver cord is snapped asunder and the golden bowl is shattered, and the pitcher is broken at the fountain.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 12, 6. None of these acts may be done because they hasten death.</i>
We may not move him, or place him on sand or salt<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">For ‘salt’ GRA reads ‘a vessel that chills’; cf. Tosiftha Shab. XVIII, 18.</i> until he dies.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">So that the body should keep cool and not swell.</i>
We may not close the eyes<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Shab. <i>loc. cit.</i> (Sonc. ed., p. 772). Closing the eyes of a corpse is a very ancient practice. According to Ibn Ezra the custom is alluded to in Gen. 46, 4, <i>and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes</i> (cf. his commentary <i>ad loc</i>.). The custom was current among the ancient Greeks and Romans and is practised by the Egyptians [cf. Seyffert, <i>Dictionary of Classical Antiquities</i>, p. 101b, and Lane, <i>Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians</i>, ch. XXVIII]. A man, at the moment of death, was believed to behold the Divine Presence (cf. Job 19, 27) and therefore it was unfitting that after that vision his eyes should look at anything mundane. Cf. A. Bender in <i>Jewish Quarterly Review</i>, VII (1895), pp. 102f.</i> of a dying man. Whoever touches and moves him is a murderer. For R. Meir used to say: He can be compared to a lamp which is dripping;<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Shab. <i>loc cit.</i> reads ‘a lamp that is going out’.</i> should a man touch it he extinguishes it. Similarly whoever closes the eyes of a dying man is considered as if he had taken his life.
We do not rend the garments or bare the shoulder,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Rashi to M.Ḳ. 22b (Sonc. ed., p. 140). R. Meir of Rothenberg explains the word <i>ḥoleẓin</i> in the usual sense of ‘removing the shoes’.</i> or deliver a memorial address, or bring the coffin into the house until he dies.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">These things should be avoided so as not to frighten the dying person.</i>
We do not summon the people<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. 1 Sam. 15, 4, XXIII, 8 for this usage of the Heb. verb. Brüll adds the word <i>‘ayaroth</i> (cf. Sanh. 47a, Sonc. ed., p. 311), ‘We do not summon the people of the townships’.</i> or recount his good deeds. R. Judah said: If he is a scholar we recount his good deeds.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Because he is accustomed to have his praises sung and it would not distress him in the circumstances.</i>
<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">This Rule is not connected with the preceding, but speaks of a case where there is a dead person in the town.</i> In the town people do not greet each other.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Because all must share in the mourning, and greeting is not permitted to a mourner.</i> This applies only in a village,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Where all learn quickly of the death.</i> but in a large city it is permissible.<br>We do not carry out the mourning rites for one who came out [at birth] by pieces or with feet foremost, or for one born prematurely<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <i>nefel</i>, a child who dies within thirty days of birth.</i> at eight months<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">And cannot therefore survive.</i> alive or at nine months dead.
For a non-Jew or a slave we do not occupy ourselves with his funeral rites, but we exclaim of him, ‘Alas lion!<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">So H; V repeats ‘lion’.</i> alas mighty man!’. R. Judah said: [We, for instance, exclaim], ‘Alas, Ṭabi!<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The faithful slave of Rabban Gamaliel (cf. Ber. 16b, Sonc. ed. p. 96).</i> alas, faithful man who ate<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">In Ber. ‘who worked for his living’.</i> of his labour!’. They said to him,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">To R. Jose who, in Ber. (Sonc. ed., p. 97), suggested the praise to be made over a faithful slave.</i> ‘[If so], what have you left [to be said] of worthy men [who are not slaves]?’ He replied, ‘If he was worthy, why should we not say it of him, since<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">So H; V lacks ‘since’.</i> we do not receive condolence for [the loss of] male or female slaves?’
It is related that when R. Eliezer’s female slave died, his disciples came to comfort him. He entered the courtyard [to avoid them], but they followed him; he went into the house, but they followed him. He said to them, ‘I imagined that you would be scalded with tepid water, but now you are not even scalded with hot water.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning is, I made it clear to you that I did not want to receive your condolence; cf. Ber. <i>loc. cit.</i></i> Have [the Sages] not said: <sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In Ber., ‘Have I not taught you’, etc.</i>We do not receive condolence for slaves because they are reckoned as animals?’<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The text in Ber. reads: What do we say over them? As we say to a man on the death of his ox or ass, ‘May the Omnipresent repair thy loss’, so we say to a man on the death of his slaves, ‘May the Omnipresent repair thy loss’.</i>
And when Ṭabi the slave of Rabban Gamaliel died, he received condolence for him. They asked him, ‘Master, have you not taught us that we do not receive condolence for slaves?’ He replied, ‘My slave Ṭabi was unlike all other slaves; he was a worthy man’.
He also permitted Ṭabi to put on the <i>tefillin</i>. They said to him, ‘Master, have you not taught us that slaves are exempt from [the precept of] <i>tefillin?</i>’ He replied, ‘My slave Ṭabi was unlike all other slaves; he was a worthy man’.
We do not call male and female slaves ‘Father So-and-so, Mother So-and-so’. Those of the house of Rabban Gamaliel, however, were called ‘Father Ṭabi’ and ‘Mother Ṭabitha’.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Quoted from Ber. <i>loc. cit.</i> [The female slave Ṭabitha is mentioned in j.Nid. I, 4, 49b.]</i>
We confine the term ‘our father’ to the three Patriarchs,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.</i> and the term ‘our mother’ to the four Matriarchs.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Sara, Rebekah, Rachel and Leah. This Rule is also culled, in a slightly different form from Ber. <i>loc. cit.</i></i>

Chapter 2

We do not occupy ourselves in any respect with the funeral rites of one who committed suicide wilfully. R. Ishmael said: We exclaim over him, ‘Alas for a lost<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <i>niṭṭelah</i>, ‘[a life] carried away’. H reads <i>nishlah</i> with a similar meaning (cf. <i>God takth away</i> [<i>yeshel</i>] <i>his soul</i>, Job 27, 8). GRA emends to <i>nithlah</i>, ‘hanged’.</i> [life!] Alas for a [lost] life!’ R. ‘Aḳiba said to him, ‘Leave him unmourned; speak neither well nor ill of him’.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘do not bless him and do not curse him’.</i><br>We do not rend garments for him,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to the <i>Ṭur</i> Y.D., §345, near relatives do not rend their garments.</i> bare the shoulder, or deliver a memorial address over him. We do, however, stand in a row<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">At the cemetery after the funeral those present divide themselves into two rows and the mourners pass between them to receive condolences.</i> for him and recite the benediction of mourners<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The condolence ended with the words, ‘Blessed be He Who comforteth the mourners’ (Keth. 8b, Sonc. ed., p. 40). Hence the term ‘benediction of mourners’; cf. J. Rabbinowitz, <i>Mishnah Megillah</i>, p. 119.</i> for him, from respect of the living [relatives]. The general rule is: With anything that makes for respect of the living we occupy ourselves, but with anything that does not make for the respect of the living, the public do not in any way occupy themselves.
Who [comes within the category of] ‘one who committed suicide wilfully’? He does not who climbed to the top of a tree and fell down and died, or he who went up to the top of the roof and fell down and died.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">It may have been an accidental fall.</i> But he who calls out, ‘Look, I am going to the top of the roof or to the top of the tree, and I will throw myself down that I may die’ [comes within the category]. When people saw him go up to the top of a tree or roof [for the purpose] and he fell down and died, he is presumed to have committed suicide wilfully; and with the person who commits suicide wilfully we do not occupy ourselves in any respect.
If a person was found strangled or hanging from a tree or lying dead on a sword, he is presumed not to have committed suicide wilfully, and none [of the rites] are withheld from him.
It is related of the son of Gorgias<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A variant is Gornos. [He is not mentioned elsewhere in Rabbinic literature.]</i> of Lydda that he ran away from school and his father pointed to his ear.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. he threatened to punish him.</i> In fear of his father he went and destroyed himself in a pit.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA and H. V wrongly ‘with a garment’.</i> They went and inquired of R. Ṭarfon who ruled: We do not withhold anything from him.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">He is buried with full rites.</i>
It is related of a child in Benë Beraḳ<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A town near Jaffa.</i> that he broke a bottle on the Sabbath and his father pointed to his ear. In fear of his father he went and destroyed himself in a pit. They inquired of R. ‘Aḳiba who ruled: We do not withhold anything from him.
Hence the Sages ruled: A man should not point at the ear of a child, but either punish him immediately or keep silent and say nothing to him.<br>R. Simeon b. Eleazar said:<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Sanh. 107b (Sonc. ed., p. 736), Soṭah 47a (Sonc. ed., p. 246).</i> With human nature,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <i>Yeẓer</i>, which means human instinct; cf. Lazarus, <i>Ethics of Judaism</i>, II, pp. 106f.</i> a child and a woman, the left hand should repulse them but the right hand bring them back.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">One should not be too severe with them, not suppressing their desires but disciplining them.</i>
With those executed by a Court we do not occupy ourselves in any respect. Their brothers and relatives come and greet the witnesses and judges<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sanh. 46a (Sonc. ed., p. 305).</i> [as if to say], ‘We have no [ill feelings] against you in our hearts because you gave a true judgment’. They observe no [public] mourning<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the seven days, thirty days and the twelve months.</i> for them but grieve, since grief is felt only in the heart.
R. Nathan said: There is no difference between silence and mourning.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the silence of the mourners is itself a form of mourning. Hence the persons mentioned in the previous Rule must not even grieve. It is suggested that R. Nathan’s statement was originally a marginal note which found its way into the text.</i>
The ‘meal of comfort’<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The first meal partaken by the mourners on their return from the funeral is termed ‘the meal of comfort [<i>habra’ah</i>]’; cf. 2 Sam. 3, 35, <i>to cause David to eat bread</i> (<i>lehabroth</i>). It was prepared by friends and consisted of lentils and eggs (cf. Sanh. 63a, Sonc. ed., p. 430, n. 6) the round shape of which being a reminder of the revolving wheel of fortune.</i> is not eaten in their case, as it is stated, <i>Ye shall not eat</i> [anything] <i>with the blood</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 19, 26. This is homiletically interpreted to mean: where blood is shed (i.e. an execution has taken place) no ceremonial meal of mourners should be eaten. Cf. Sanh. <i>loc. cit.</i></i><br>[The judges of] a Court who ordered the execution of a man used not to eat anything on that day.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Sanh. <i>loc. cit.</i></i><br>[The condemned] are allowed to converse with their brothers and relatives; and not to delay matters<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. to avoid giving the appearance that the execution of justice is unduly protracted.</i> they are given to drink wine containing frankincense<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">To numb the senses; cf. Sanh. 43a (Sonc. ed., p. 279).</i> so that they should not feel grieved. They are urged<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘they teach them’.</i> to confess, because he who confesses has a portion in the World to Come. We find it so with Achan to whom Joshua said, <i>My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and make confession unto Him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide nothing from me. And Achan answered Joshua, and said: Of a truth I have sinned against the Lord, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Josh. 7, 19f.</i> What is the meaning of <i>and thus and thus?</i> It teaches that he violated the ban twice.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">By taking from the devoted things on two occasions. Sanh. 43b (Sonc. ed., p. 284) explains that he took of the ban three times, twice in the days of Moses and once at Jericho.</i> [44<i>b</i>] <i>I have sinned</i>, i.e. I and not my household, I and not my children. This teaches that he truthfully<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Of a truth (’omnam</i>) is explained as <i>be’emunah</i> (‘truthfully’).</i> confessed. And whence do we know that his confession made atonement for him? As it is stated, <i>And Joshua said: Why hast thou troubled us? The Lord shall trouble thee this day</i><sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid</i>. 25.</i>—<i>this day</i> art thou to be troubled but thou shalt not be troubled in the World to Come; and it states, <i>And the sons of Zerah: Zimri, and Ethan, and Heman, and Calcol and Dara: five of them in all.</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">1 Chron. 2, 6.</i> Do we not know that there were <i>five of them in all?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Since five names are specified.</i> It teaches that Achan will be with them in the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sanh. 44b (Sonc. ed., p. 291). Zimri, according to a tradition, is identical with Achan. As Achan is mentioned together with the other four, who are considered to be worthy men, it is an indication that his confession was accepted and with them he shared in the World to Come.</i><br>Similarly one who steals the tax<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. eludes the customs; cf. B.Ḳ. 113a (Sonc. ed., p. 663), Tosiftha B.Ḳ. X, 8.</i> or anything devoted [to the Sanctuary] is as if he shed blood; and not only is he as if he shed blood, but he is also as if he worships idols, was guilty of immorality and desecrates the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">[On this passage, cf. Büchler, <i>Studies in Sin and Atonement</i>, p. 198n.]</i>
We do not occupy ourselves with those who separated themselves from the community<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">According to Maimonides (<i>Hil. ’Ebel</i>, I, 5, cf. <i>Ṭur</i> Y.D., §345) the reference is to those who discarded all the religious precepts and ceremonies of Judaism.</i> in any respect. Their brothers and relatives clothe themselves in white, wrap themselves in white and eat and drink and rejoice because an enemy of the All-present perished; as it is stated, <i>Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate Thee? And do not I strive with those that rise up against Thee? I hate them with utmost hatred; I count them mine enemies</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 139, 21f.</i>
We do not withhold mourning rites from those executed by the Government.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the occupying power, viz. the Romans.</i><br>When do we begin to count [the days of mourning] for them?<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Usually this begins from the moment the grave is filled in, but here the body of the victim was not handed over to the family for burial.</i> From the time that [the relatives] despaired in their appeal [for the body to be delivered to them for burial], but not [given up the hope] of stealing it. For he who steals is as if he shed blood, and not only is he as if he had shed blood, but also as if he worshipped idols, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence is repeated from the last clause of Rule 9 and has no relevance to the present context.</i>
Mourning rites are not withheld in any respect from one who fell into the sea, or was washed away by a stream, or killed by a wild beast. When do we begin to count [the days of mourning] for such as these? From the time that hope of finding them has been given up. If they found a body limb by limb, we do not count [the days of mourning] until the head and greater part [of the torso] is found. R. Judah said: The spine and skull constitute the greater part [of the torso].
If one’s husband, wife, father or mother had been impaled<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">By the Roman authorities. Impaling was not a form of execution carried out by the Jews.</i> in his city, one should not continue to reside there<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">On seeing him, people will recall the impaling of his relative, and that would be a slight on the memory of the victim.</i> unless it is a city as big as Antioch.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">The ancient capital of Syria. Since it is a large city, the fact might not be generally known.</i> [Even then] one should not reside in the same side of the city but in another part. Until when is one so forbidden? Until the flesh is completely decomposed and the identity<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘the form’.</i> unrecognizable from the bones.
[Beth Shammai said:]<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">GRA omits. For what follows, cf. Keth. 27b, 28a (Sonc. ed., p. 152).</i> If a man divorced his wife, he should not live in the same alley or courtyard as she.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Lest he be tempted to cohabit with her.</i> If the alley belonged to both of them, he transfers the door [of his house] to another side; and if the courtyard belonged to both of them, one vacates it on account of the other, and the woman vacates it on account of the man. This rule only applies if she has remarried<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA; V ‘they have married’. After remarriage with another she can never return to her first husband (cf. Deut. 24, 3f).</i> and in the case of the [divorced] wife of a <i>kohen</i> even if she has not remarried.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">A <i>kohen</i> may not marry a divorced woman, not even his divorced wife (Lev. 21, 7).</i> It further applies only if she is divorced after marriage and not after betrothal.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Kallah 1, n. 1.</i> Likewise one who has freed his sister-in-law from the levirate marriage<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Deut. 25, 5ff.</i> does not vacate on account of her, because he does not feel attracted to her.

Chapter 3

A child who lived only one day counts to his father and mother as a fully-grown man.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">With respect to mourning; cf. Nid. 44a (Sonc. ed., p. 303). The phrase <i>ḥathan shalem</i>, lit. ‘a complete bridegroom’, is based on <i>ḥathan damim, a bridegroom of blood</i> (Ex. 4, 25). For the idea that circumcision makes one ‘complete’, cf. Ned. 31b (Sonc. ed., p. 93).</i> [The words] ‘who lived only one day’ are not to be taken as an [irreducible] limit;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘the end of the matter’.</i> even if only his head and the greater part of his body came out viable [he is so counted, but in their formulation of the law] the Sages speak of what actually happens.
<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. M.Ḳ. 24a (Sonc. ed., p. 151).</i> [An infant] who is carried in the arms<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘goes out in the bosom’.</i> is buried by one woman and two men.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">For reasons of propriety. GRA inserts ‘but not by one man and two women’.</i> Abba Saul said: [The burial may be done] by one man and two women. [The Sages] said to him: One woman may be alone with two men, but one man may not be alone with two women.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">A quotation from Ḳid. IV, 12 (Sonc. ed., p. 413).</i><br>[The people at the burial] do not stand in line on account of him and they need not recite the mourner’s benediction on account of him unless he was thirty days old. If he was thirty days old, he is accompanied [to the grave] by men and women and is carried in a case upon the arms<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. M.Ḳ. 24b (Sonc. ed., pp. 151f). Apparently not a full-sized coffin is meant.</i> up to the age of twelve months. If he was twelve months old, he is accompanied by men and women and is carried in a case on the shoulder up to the age of three years. R. Judah said: Should his father desire to honour him, they take him out in a coffin to the cemetery even before<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA; V ‘until’.</i> he is three years old.
If three years old he is taken out on a bier. R. ‘Aḳiba said: If he is three years old but his limbs are [developed] like those of an infant two years old,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">V wrongly in brackets ‘he is not carried on a bier’.</i> or if he is two years old but his limbs are like those of an infant three years old, he is carried on a bier.

It is related that when R. Simeon b. Yehoẓadaḳ died in Lydda, his brother Joḥanan came from Galilee to defile himself for him after the top stone had closed the grave. They went and inquired of the Sages who said: He may not defile himself, but open the grave for him that he may view [the body].

If he defiles himself [for a stranger] on the same day [as for another], R. Ṭarfon deems him culpable, but R. ‘Aḳiba frees him from culpability.

Chapter 5

A mourner is forbidden to do work<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. M.Ḳ. 15b (Sonc. ed., p. 92) where by an interpretation of Amos 8, 10 and by the process of analogy this rule is arrived at.</i> throughout the seven days<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>ibid</i>. 21b (Sonc. ed., p. 135) where the reading is ‘the first three days’.

They may do work for him in connection with perishable things; they may gather his harvest for him, operate his wine-press for him and bung<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>gafin</i> with H.</i> his casks.

Jose said to him, ‘But they are perishable things! He may complete [the whole operation in his mourning]’.
With regard to his flax [which is ready] for lifting from the retting and his wool [ready] for lifting from the dye-bath, if there are others [to do the work] they should lift it,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">GRA reads <i>’otho</i> for V’s <i>‘immo</i>.</i> but if not he may lift it in private.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">M.Ḳ. 11b (Sonc. ed., p. 63). ‘In private’ means behind closed doors.</i>
If his cask [of wine] is [ready] for bunging, R.

The Sages differ from R. Eliezer on both points, viz. they forbid the sprinkling of a white field and sowing flax during the mourning.</i>
If he is a baker in the town and there is no other, he may do the work in private out of respect<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">GRA reads <span dir="rtl">צורך</span>, ‘needs’ instead of <span dir="rtl">כבוד</span>, ‘respect of’.</i> for the public.
R. Simeon b.

If he is engaged in cutting a person’s hair and people come and tell him, ‘Your father is dead’, he should complete the work; this applies whether he is the hair-dresser or he is having his hair dressed. Workmen who have undertaken to do work for a mourner are forbidden to do it in his house but may do it in their own. R. Simeon b. Yoḥai<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">GRA reads ‘Eleazar’.</i> said: A workman hired by the day is forbidden<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Because he has the right to repudiate his bargain at any time.</i> to do work in either [place]; a workman on a contract basis<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. a piece-worker.</i> is forbidden [to do it in the mourner’s] house, but may do it in his own home. If it is work in connection with objects attached to the ground, it is forbidden [to do the work in either place];<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Because it is generally known that they are working for the mourner.</i> in another town it is permitted in either case.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">It is not generally so known.</i>
A mourner overtaken by his days of mourning<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. he suffered one bereavement immediately after another.</i> may ease [his hair] with a shearing-knife or a clipping-tool,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">GRA reads ‘or with a razor’ in accordance with M.Ḳ. 17b (Sonc. ed., p. 112).

A mourner and an excommunicated person who are travelling on the road are permitted to wear their shoes, but as soon as they reach a city they must remove them.

An excommunicated person who died has to be ‘stoned’<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. M.Ḳ. 15a (Sonc. ed., p. 88).</i>—not that they place a high heap of stones upon him, as in the case of Achan<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

One who is placed under excommunication by his city is not<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">GRA and H insert ‘not’.</i> considered to be under it in another city; [46<i>a</i>] one under the ban to the disciples is not under the ban to the Sages; one under the ban to the Sages is under the ban to the disciples; one under the ban to all the people is not under the ban to the <i>Nasi’;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">The President of the Grand Sanhedrin.</i> one under the ban to the <i>Nasi’</i> is under the ban to all the people.

Chapter 6

<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">For a full discussion of what is prohibited to a mourner, cf. M.Ḳ. 15a, b and 21a, b (Sonc. ed., pp. 90ff, 133ff). The law is based on Ezek. 24, 17, 23 where the prophet is warned not to observe the usual rites of mourning.</i> A mourner is forbidden to read the Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiographa;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Because the study of the Torah is a joy.</i> he is also forbidden to study Mishnah, Talmud, <i>halakoth</i> and <i>’aggadoth</i>. He is under the prohibition to bathe, anoint [the body], put on sandals<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">These and covering the head are signs of mourning; cf. 2 Sam. 15, 30, Jer. 14, 3f, Esth. 6, 12.</i> and cohabit. He is obliged to cover his head and overturn his couch.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. M.Ḳ. 15a, b (Sonc. ed., p. 92): God says, ‘I have set the likeness of Mine image on them and through their sins have I upset it; let your couches be overturned on account thereof’. According to A. Marmorstein the rite served the purpose of warning the mourners against sexual intercourse which is forbidden in the days of mourning; cf. j.Ber. III, 1, 6a.</i><br>It is related of Rabban Gamaliel<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ber. 16b (Sonc. ed., p. 96).</i> that when his wife died he bathed on the first night. His disciples said to him, ‘Master, have you not taught us that a mourner is forbidden to bathe?’ He replied, ‘I am not like other men, I am delicate’.
<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">From this point V does not divide the chapters into Rules and the division of H is adopted.</i> If people greet him, he should say to them, ‘I am a mourner’. On the first day and on the second day he should say to them, ‘I am a mourner’, but on the third day he may return their salutation in a low voice, although he may not greet them.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. M.Ḳ. 21b (Sonc. ed., p. 135). The reading of GRA is: ‘On the first, second and third days, he says to them, “I am a mourner”, but from the fourth day onwards he returns their salutation’.</i>
On the first day he does not put on the <i>tefillin;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid</i>. 21a (Sonc. ed., p. 134). GRA transposes the names of the two Rabbis in agreement with the Talmud.</i> on the second day he puts them on and if people come to comfort him he takes them off, according to the view of R. Eliezer. R. Joshua said: On the first and second day he does not put on the <i>tefillin;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid</i>. 21a (Sonc. ed., p. 134). GRA transposes the names of the two Rabbis in agreement with the Talmud.</i> on the third day he puts them on and if people come to comfort him he takes them off.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">GRA reads: ‘he does not take them off’; H adds at the end ‘all the seven days’.</i>
If [another] death took place in that city, on the first and second day [of his own mourning] he does not go out with [the other mourners],<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">To the cemetery to attend the funeral.</i> but on the third day he goes out with them and stands in the line to receive condolence but not to offer comfort to the others. This only holds good when there are sufficient people to carry the bier and do the burial, but if there are not sufficient he goes out with them even on the first day.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. M.Ḳ. 21b (Sonc. ed., p. 135).</i>
If he came from another district to his relatives, on the second and third day he completes [the days of his mourning] with them, but from the fourth day he counts [the remaining period of mourning] on his own.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid</i>. (Sonc. ed., p. 138). So GRA; V reads ‘on the fourth and fifth’.</i> R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: If he found them still sitting [as mourners] even if it is the seventh day<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA according to M.Ḳ. <i>loc. cit</i>. V wrongly ‘third day’.</i> he completes [the period] with them; and if he did not find them sitting [as mourners] even if it be the second day he counts on his own.
On the first and second day, he may not do work even if he is in receipt of charity.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <span dir="rtl">תמחוי</span>, the daily distribution of food to the poor supplied by contributors.</i> On the third day he may<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">GRA omits ‘go out and’ which is in V.</i> work but in private.
<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">H inserts ‘on the first and second day’.</i> He may not work in a field adjoining the city or the road, but he may work privately in his own garden. Likewise a woman may not work on top of the roof or within the courtyard, but she may work privately in her house so long as she is not overlooked by her neighbours.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. M.Ḳ. 21b (Sonc. ed., p. 135).</i>
[The period of] three days applies to a dog which devoured [some of] the flesh of a corpse and entered a house. If this happened after three days the house is clean, if less it is unclean.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Ohol. XI, 7 (Sonc. ed., p. 198), Shab. 155b (Sonc. ed., p. 796). Three days is deemed to be sufficient time for the dog to have digested the flesh of the corpse, and therefore there is no longer a question of uncleanness being conveyed by the dog into the house. This and the other extraneous matter which follows is introduced here because of the ‘three days’ which is the time factor.</i>
[The period of] three days<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ḥallah I, 1f (Sonc. ed., pp. 317f), Men. 70a (Sonc. ed., p. 414). Grain sown three days before Passover is deemed to have taken root. Hence the Omer brought on Passover renders them permissible to be eaten any time after Passover. But if sown less than three days, it is no longer considered the present year’s produce when it ripens and may not be eaten until the Omer of the following year is brought.</i> applies to any of the five species<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Wheat, barley, rye, oats and spelt.</i> [of grain] sown; [if three days] before Passover it is permitted [to be eaten], if less than this it is prohibited.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The last clause is added by GRA.</i>
One should not go out with a caravan less than three days before the Sabbath.<br>One may not go out to war,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Tosiftha ‘Erub.

On the first and second day [of mourning] he may not enter the Temple Mount; on the third day he may enter but must go round to the left.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Since he is forbidden to bring an offering (Deut. 26, 14); cf. Mid. II, 2 (Sonc. ed. p. 6).</i> These are they who must go round to the left: a mourner, an excommunicated person, one who has a sick person in his house, and one who lost an object. [When asked,] ‘Why do you<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Reading with GRA and H <span dir="rtl">מה לך</span> for V’s <span dir="rtl">מהלך</span>.</i> go round to the left?’ [he answers,] ‘Because I am a mourner’. They reply, ‘May He Who dwells in this House comfort you’. [If he says,] ‘Because I am under a ban’, [they reply,] ‘May He Who dwells in this House put it into their heart to draw you near’; so said R. Meir. R. Jose said to him, ‘You make out as if they [who banned] passed a wrong judgment on him; but [what they say is,] “May He Who dwells in this house put it into your heart to hearken to the words of your colleagues so that they may draw you near” ’. To one who has a sick person in his house they say, ‘May He Who dwells in this House have mercy upon him’; and if he is barely living<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘son of existence’, far gone in his illness.</i> [they say,] ‘May He have mercy upon him immediately’. It is related of a certain woman whose daughter was ill that she ascended the Temple Mount and went round it, and did not move from there until they came and told her, ‘She is cured’.<br>To one who lost some object they say, ‘May He Who dwells in this House put it into the heart of the finder to return it to you at once’. It is related of Eleazar b. Ḥananiah b. Hezekiah b. Gorion that he lost a scroll of the Torah which he had bought for one hundred <i>minas</i>. He ascended [the Temple Mount], went round it and did not move from there until they came and told him, ‘The scroll of the Torah has been found’.
From the beginning Solomon built the Temple only on condition that anyone in trouble would come there and pray; as it is stated, <i>If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, if there be blasting or mildew, locust or caterpillar; if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoever sickness there be; what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">1 Kings 8, 37f.</i> I have here only the case of an individual; whence do we know that it also holds good of a community? The text continues, <i>Of all Thy people Israel</i>. Whence do we know that it holds good of the non-Jew? The text states, <i>Moreover concerning the stranger that is not of Thy people Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid</i>. 42.</i> From the words <i>be made by any man</i> you might think that it holds good of one who wants children or possessions which will not be for his welfare; hence Scripture states, <i>For Thou, even Thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid</i>. 39.</i>—what is good for him do Thou give to him. And whence do we know that this holds good only if they do not continue in their rebellion?

Chapter 7

The Sabbath enters into the number of the days of mourning<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. M.Ḳ. 19a (Sonc. ed., p. 121).</i> but does not interrupt;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Although all mourning is suspended on the Sabbath it is yet reckoned as one of the seven days, and the remaining days of mourning continue after the Sabbath.</i> Festivals interrupt<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Cancel the rest of the days of mourning.</i> but do not enter into the number.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">If the burial took place during the Festival.</i> R. Eliezer said: Since the destruction of the Temple, ‘<i>Aẓereth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘solemn assembly’, the name given in Rabbinic literature to Pentecost. The Rabbis regarded this Festival as the complement of Passover in the same way that <i>Shemini ‘Aẓereth</i> (cf. Num. 29, 35) is the complement of Tabernacles.</i> is reckoned as the Sabbath [during the period of mourning]. Rabban Gamaliel<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA; V has ‘Rabban Simeon b.

If a man suffered a bereavement one day before a Festival, he interrupts [his mourning] throughout the Festival and counts six days [of mourning] after the Festival; if three days before the Festival he does not need to overturn his couch<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The remaining days are cancelled.</i> [after the Festival] according to R. Eliezer;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The translation follows the text as emended by GRA in agreement with M.Ḳ. 20a (Sonc. ed., p. 126).</i> but the Sages said: Even one day, or even one hour [before the Festival]. R. Eliezer b. R. Simeon said: These are the very words of Beth Shammai, and also the very words of Beth Hillel; because Beth Shammai said, ‘Three days before a Festival’ and Beth Hillel said, ‘Even one day and even one hour’. [46<i>b</i>]
Abba Saul said: If one buried his dead three days before a Festival, the restrictions<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <i>gezeroth</i>, ‘restrictive measures’, i.e. the prohibitions of a mourner as enumerated in the preceding chapters.</i> appertaining to the seven days’ mourning cease to apply to him; if eight days before a Festival, the restrictions of the thirty days cease to apply<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

By then he has sufficiently done his duty to the dead.</i> (and the ruling is in accordance with this statement).<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">GRA deletes this clause which is printed by V in brackets.</i>
[Should the death occur] eight days before a Festival, if he wishes to cut his hair or wash his clothes on the eve of the Festival he may do so; if he did not cut his hair or wash his clothes on the eve of the Festival, he may not do so until the thirty days are completed.
[If the death occurs] two days within the Festival,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Passover or Tabernacles.</i> he interrupts [the mourning] for all the Festival and counts seven [days] after it, and people occupy themselves<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">People came to offer him condolence.</i> with him for the five days after the Festival.

On the days which he counts after a Festival, neither his slave nor his cattle need abstain from work; only he and his near kin conduct themselves like mourners.

A mourner is regarded on a Festival as if he were no mourner, but in matters of a private nature he does observe mourning. The general rule is: as regards any [mourning rite] in the carrying out of which others are associated with him,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">e.g. consolation of the mourners.</i> a Festival is taken into account with the seven days,<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Hence when the burial took place during the Festival, people come to condole for four days only or not at all.</i> otherwise it is not taken into account with them.
Thirty are the days of mourning.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">All the points mentioned in this Rule are discussed in the continuation.</i> For thirty days he may not put on pressed clothes<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. clothes ironed or pressed smooth of creases; cf. Krauss, <i>Talmudische Archäologie</i>, I, p. 581, n. 375.</i> or cut his hair. Thirty days are allowed for the collection of debts; thirty days must elapse before a captive woman of ‘goodly form’<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Deut. 21, 11.</i> may be taken to wife; thirty days in the case of betrothal; thirty days in the case of marriage; thirty days within which a charge of lack of virginity can be made; thirty days are granted to a widow about to remarry to make her preparations; thirty days for a sister-in-law [after her levirate marriage to declare, ‘He has not cohabited with me’]. If a man forbade his wife by vow to have any benefit from him [the prohibition lasts] thirty days. The vow of a Nazirite of unspecified duration [remains in force] for thirty days.
Whence [thirty days] for mourning? As it is stated, <i>And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid</i>. XXXIV, 8.</i>
How is it with pressed clothes? It is forbidden [for a mourner] to don pressed clothes, i.e. those that came from the press.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">After bleaching, the clothes were put in the press; M.Ḳ. 23a (Sonc. ed., p. 145, n. 5).</i> This is the view of Rabbi [Judah the Prince]; the Sages said: [It refers] to dyed but not white garments. R. Meir said: White but not dyed, new but not worn garments. He may put on his money-belt,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">A hollow belt in which money was carried.</i> girdle,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">A band or fillet worn by women over the breast.</i> felt-shoes<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Or, felt hat.</i> and turban.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Although they are pressed, they are not regarded as garments.</i> It is permitted to take garments to be pressed within thirty days.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In readiness for wear after the thirty days.</i>
How is it with cutting the hair? [A mourner] is forbidden to remove the hair whether of the head or of his [upper] lip, or of the beard or of the hair on any part of him. A woman is permitted to remove hair<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The translation follows the text of GRA and H.</i> after the seven days.<br>How is it with the collection of debts?<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Mak. 3b (Sonc. ed., p. 11).</i> If a person lends his friend money without specifying a date [for repayment], he may not demand it of him until thirty days are completed.
How is it with a woman of ‘goodly form’? [It is stated,] <i>And thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife; then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 21, 11f; cf.

Eliezer;<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The text is so corrected by GRA and H in accordance with Yeb. <i>loc. cit</i>. The Heb. verb, the meaning of which is disputed, is lit. ‘do’.</i> R. ‘Aḳiba [takes the meaning to be,] she lets the hair of her head grow long and lets her nails grow. R. Eliezer said: An act is mentioned in respect of the head<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote"><i>She shall shave her head</i>.</i> and an act is mentioned in respect of her nails;<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>And ‘do’ her nails</i>.</i> as the former signifies removal of the hair so the latter signifies removal of the nails. R. ‘Aḳiba said: An act is mentioned in respect of the head and an act is mentioned in respect of the nails; as disfigurement is the purpose of the former so is disfigurement the purpose of the latter. There is a support for R. Eliezer [in the verse], <i>And Mephibosheth the son of Saul came down to meet the king; and he had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">2 Sam. 19, 25, where the word for <i>trimmed</i> is lit. ‘done’.</i> There is a support for R. ‘Aḳiba [in the verse], <i>Till his hair was grown like eagles’ feathers, and his nails like birds’ claws</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Dan. 4, 30.

Eliezer; but R. ‘Aḳiba explains that <i>her father and her mother</i> refers to the idols [which she worshipped], as it is stated, <i>Who say to a stock: ‘Thou art my father’, and to a stone: ‘Thou hast brought us forth’</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Jer. 2, 27.</i><br><i>A month of days</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">Deut, <i>ibid</i>., E.V. <i>a full month</i>. The translation follows the emended text of GRA.</i>—i.e. thirty days. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: [It means] three months, as it is stated, <i>And bewail her father and her mother a month</i>, i.e. one month, <i>of days</i> signifies [with the former] two months, <i>and after that</i> [is added in the text] to include the third month, [the purpose being] that the holy seed shall not be mingled with that of other peoples. When does this apply? Only if she does not wish to become a proselyte; but if she is willing to become a proselyte, he has her immersed [in the ritual bath] and emancipates her, and is permitted to marry her forthwith. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Even if she is not willing<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Added by GRA.</i> at first, he has her immersed as a handmaid, emancipates her and may marry her forthwith. Why all this [procedure]? In order that the holy seed should not be mingled with that of other peoples.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The question and answer are deleted by GRA.</i> It is better for Israelites to eat the flesh of animals about to die, yet ritually slaughtered, than the flesh of dying animals which definitely perished.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">And were not ritually slaughtered. The intention is that the procedure is based on the principle of the lesser evil. It is better for the man to be married to the woman rather than just cohabit with her (cf. Ḳid. 21b, 22a, Sonc. ed., p. 104). The last word of the sentence should be read as <span dir="rtl">בודאי</span> (definitely) instead of <span dir="rtl">לבדה</span> (alone).</i>
How is it with betrothal? It is forbidden to hold a betrothal feast within the thirty days [of mourning].<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Cf M.Ḳ. 23a (Sonc. ed., p. 145).</i>
How is it with marriage? It is forbidden to hold a marriage feast within the thirty days [of mourning], but if his meat is prepared<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

Only if his father or mother-in-law died; but if his wife died, he is forbidden to remarry until three Festivals have gone by. R. Judah said: Until two Festivals have gone by, and he brings [her into the marital chamber] on the third. When does this apply? Only if he has children, but if he has no children or his children are young, it is permitted for him to remarry within thirty days.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. M.Ḳ. <i>loc. cit</i>.</i> It happened that R. Ṭarfon’s wife died, and he said to her sister within the days of mourning, ‘Be my wife and bring up your sister’s children’. Nevertheless he did not cohabit with her until after the thirty days.
How is it with virginity? Within thirty days he may make a plea of the absence of virginity,<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 22, 13ff; Yeb. 111b (Sonc. ed., p. 780).</i> but after thirty days he cannot.
How is it with a widow?<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Keth. 57a (Sonc. ed., p. 337).</i> If the man [to whom she is betrothed] claims her [in marriage] and she holds back, we allow her thirty days to make provision for herself; and as we allow [that period] to the woman, so too we allow it to the man.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the same time is allowed to a widow and to a man to make preparation for the wedding.</i>

Chapter 8

We go out to the cemetery and examine<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">To see if by chance there is life in them.

This is an argument from minor to major: if with an animal, which is capable neither of merit nor guilt, neither of good nor evil, because it was a stumbling-block to a human being the Torah declared, <i>It shall be stoned</i>, how much more [will a man be punished] who causes his neighbour to sin and turns him from the way of life to the path of death!<br>Similarly Scripture declares of the stones of the altar, <i>Thou shalt lift up no iron tool upon them</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 27, 5.</i> and elsewhere it states, <i>For if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast profaned it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20, 22.</i> Wherein is iron different from all other metals to be unfit for [the building of] the altar?

This is an argument from minor to major: if with the stones of the altar which do not see and speak, eat or drink, because they make peace between Israel and their Father in heaven the Torah declared, <i>Thou shalt lift no iron tool upon them</i>, the children of the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">The people of Israel.</i> who are an atonement for the world, how much more [should they not lift an iron tool against each other!] Similarly Scripture declares, <i>Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord thy God of unhewn stones</i><sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 27, 6.</i>—stones that bring peace to the world. This is an argument from minor to major: if with stones which do not see or hear, speak or eat or drink, because they make peace between Israel and their Father in heaven they must be ‘whole’ [48<i>a</i>] before [the Holy One, blessed be He], how much more the children of the Torah, who are an atonement for the world, must be ‘whole’ before the Holy One, blessed be He!

[In the choice between going] to the house of mourning and the house of feasting, the house of feasting takes precedence; to a circumcision and to gather bones, the circumcision takes precedence. The pious men of olden days, however, gave precedence to the house of mourning over the house of feasting, for it is stated, <i>It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting; for that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 7, 2.</i> Whoever follows the bier should say, ‘I, too, will follow this one [to the grave]’.
We do not break the bones nor sever the sinews [of a corpse] unless the bones were already broken of their own accord and the sinews severed of their own accord.

One may gather the bones of two dead persons at the same time; he then places one collection at one end of the sheet [49<i>b</i>] and the other at the other side of it, in the view of R. ‘Aḳiba. R.

Chapter 13

One who gathers or guards bones is exempt from reading the <i>Shema‘</i>, the <i>Tefillah</i>, from <i>tefillin</i> and all the commandments prescribed by the Torah. Should he desire to impose a strict view upon himself, he may not do so because of the honour of the bones.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">His obedience of laws, from which he is exempt, would result in delay in the burial of the bones.</i> R. Joḥanan b. Nuri said: He should withdraw a distance of four cubits and read [the prayers]. R.

Isaac said: If they are the bones of a near relative he is exempt, but if of strangers he is under obligation. R.

R. Nathan said:<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The text is corrupt and emended by GRA. R. Nathan agrees with the ruling that one who guards bones is exempt from the <i>Shema‘</i>, etc., because his concern about their safety may not allow him to concentrate on his religious devotions; but where he carries them in a bundle the question of their safety does not arise and he should be able to concentrate.</i> If the bundle [containing the bones] is with him, he is not exempt<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">In his note on the text GRA reads ‘is exempt’, but in his annotation to Y.D. ch. 403 he rules that, in the circumstances here described, the man is obliged to read the prayers, etc.</i> because the obligation of guarding [the bones] rests upon him but not the obligation of guarding the bundle.

If one is constructing a burial chamber<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Vaults were made in the graves for receiving the dead; cf.

We do not bury two dead bodies in close proximity to each other, or a dead body in close proximity to bones, or bones in close proximity to a dead body. R.

One may derive benefit from a grave which has been cleared,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Since it is no longer considered the possession of the dead.</i> but he may not turn it into a magazine for straw, a stable, a store for wood or a depot.
