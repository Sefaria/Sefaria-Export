Chapter 1

[The regulations regarding] a Hebrew slave<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">An Israelite, according to the Rabbis, could become a slave either through being sold by the <i>Beth Din</i> to make restitution for a theft or through selling himself for a livelihood.</i> and a slave whose ear is bored [<i>nirẓa‘</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Because he refused to go free after six years’ service (Ex. 21, 5f.; Deut. 15, 16f.).</i> are in force only when the Jubilee [is in force].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">This apparently means, so long as the years from one Jubilee to the next are being officially counted, as laid down in Lev. 25, 8.</i><br>[The regulations regarding] a field of possession<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>ibid.</i> XXVII, 16-21. A ‘field of possession’ is one that has been inherited as distinct from a ‘field of purchase’.</i> and a field which had been devoted [to the Temple]<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>ibid.</i> 28f.</i> are in force only when the Jubilee [is in force]. R. Ishmael said: For that reason it is stated, <i>As a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 21.</i>—as possession [depends] on the Jubilee, so a field which had been devoted [depends] on the Jubilee.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A field of possession which had been dedicated by the owner, then sold by the priests and not redeemed before the Jubilee. Such a field at the Jubilee became the property of the priest. Cf. Rashi on <i>ibid.</i> 16.</i> The Jubilee is on the same footing as the New Year in regard to the blowing [of the <i>shofar</i>],<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>ibid.</i> XXV, 9.</i> and the benedictions,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">[Nine blessings have to be said over the <i>shofar</i> as on the New Year; R.H. 26b (Sonc. ed., p. 120, n. 2).]</i> except that [the blowing of] the <i>shofar</i> on the Jubilee overrides the Sabbath.<sup class="footnote-marker">9a</sup><i class="footnote">(9<i>a</i>) [The <i>shofar</i> is not blown on the day of the New Year which falls on the Sabbath.]</i> When did the Jubilees cease [to be observed]? From the time when Pul and Tiglath-pileser, kings of Assyria, came up and carried the Reubenites, the Gaddites and half the tribe of Manasseh into captivity.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. 2 Kings 15, 19, 29.</i>
<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph is quoted from Mishnah Ḳid. I, 2 (Sonc. ed., p. 59).</i> A Hebrew slave is acquired by money purchase or by document, and he acquires his freedom by years of service,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ex. 21, 2; Deut. 15, 12.</i> through the advent of the Jubilee<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. 25, 40f.</i> and by deduction of money.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. by repaying his master his purchase price less the value of the service he has completed.</i> The Hebrew handmaid has an advantage over him in that she acquires her freedom by the signs [of puberty]. The <i>nirẓa‘</i> is acquired by the boring [of his ear] and acquires his freedom through [the advent of] the Jubilee or through the death of his master.
If a man writes a document of divorce for his handmaid,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Instead of giving her a deed of manumission. According to the Gemara, Giṭ. 85b (Sonc. ed., p. 412), there was no difference of opinion on this point.</i> R. Ḥanina b. Gamaliel says that she does not become free, but the Sages say that she does become free. If he said to her,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Without giving her a document.</i> ‘Behold, you are free’, the Sages say that she does not become free.
[4. If one who is about to die says, ‘My slave So-and-so is free’, then he is free. If he wrote a deed of manumission for him, ‘Behold this [slave] is free’, the latter should have concern.]<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">[Whether he is free. This paragraph is omitted in V and MS.K. but added in H.]</i><br>A man may sell his daughter from one servitude to another,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. he may sell her a second time if the first master dies or releases her.</i> and from one matrimony to another and from servitude to matrimony, but not from matrimony to servitude. [R. Simeon said: He may not sell her from one servitude to another, much less from matrimony to servitude.]<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The words in brackets are not in V and are introduced from MS.K.</i>
If a man sells his daughter on condition of her not being betrothed by the master, his sale is valid but his condition is void, because he made a condition overriding what is written in the Torah,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Which declares, <i>If she please not her master who hath espoused her to himself</i> (Ex. 21, 8). The Rabbis took this to mean that he bought her for the purpose of espousing her.</i> and whoever makes a condition which overrides a prescription of the Torah [does something which] is void.
If the father wants to betroth her and the son wants to betroth her, the father takes precedence. If the son wants to betroth her and the father to redeem her, the son takes precedence, because the precept of betrothing takes precedence over the precept of redeeming, as it is stated, <i>Who hath espoused her to himself, then shall he let her be redeemed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20a</sup><i class="footnote">(20a) Ex. 21, 8.</i> Two must not be betrothed together.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">A master cannot be betrothed to two maidservants simultaneously.</i>
A brother<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Of the master of the maidservant.</i> must not betroth her. [This had to be mentioned] because it might have been argued: Seeing that the son who does not take the place of his father to act as levir may betroth her, does it not stand to reason that one who takes the place of his brother to act as levir should betroth her! Hence [the Torah] states, <i>And if he espouse her unto his son</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 21, 9.</i> thus excluding the brother.
If he betrothed her at the end of the [six] years [of bondage], should she still be in his possession<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. if there is still time for her to do work for him to the value of a <i>peruṭah</i>.</i> she is betrothed, according to the view of R. Simeon b. Eleazar, and if not she is not betrothed. The Sages, however, say that as long as she is in his possession<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Until the setting of the sun.</i> she is betrothed, since that was the condition on which he paid the money [for her] at the beginning.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">viz. that the purchase money should also serve as the money of betrothal.</i>
If a man sells his daughter and then went and betrothed her to another, he made game of the master<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">And the betrothal to the second is valid; cf. Ḳid. 19b (Sonc. ed., p. 88).</i> according to R. Jose b. Judah; but the Sages say that he has done nothing.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The second betrothal is invalid.</i>

Chapter 2

A Hebrew slave does work by day but not by night. R. Jose said: It all depends on his occupation. All agree that [the master] should not teach him to be a dyer, a butcher, or a baker for the public.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">But he can serve him privately in these capacities. MS.K. and H add ‘or a money-changer to the public’.</i> He should not carry him to the privy or carry his clothes before him to the bath-house or gird his loins for him,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">[H understands the phrase to mean ‘support his master in walking’.]</i> massage or anoint him.
He eats the same food and drinks the same drink [as his master]; he sits at meals with him<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">MS.K. and H add ‘and sleeps facing him’.</i> even if his stomach is full.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘heavy’, i.e. he is not hungry. This is the reading of MS.K. and H. V has ‘even if he is idle’.</i> If he is beaten or falls ill, [the master] does not reckon the time of his idleness,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. he deducts the time the slave did not work from the period of service.</i> but if [the slave] runs away and returns, he does reckon the time when he was not working.
[An Israelite] may not sell himself in order to obtain clothing or bedding, but he may sell himself to maintain himself alive.
When [the slave] has completed his term of years, he must not be sent away empty-handed, as it is written, <i>And when thou lettest him go free from thee, thou shalt not let him go empty; thou shalt furnish him liberally</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 15, 13f.</i> R. Eleazar b. Azariah says: If the house is blessed on his account he is furnished liberally, but otherwise not. R. ‘Aḳiba says: In either case [the master] should not give him less than fifty <i>zuz</i>. We give him as parting gifts anything except slaves, documents and immovable property.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. things that do not grow from the soil, because Scripture ordained, <i>Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy threshing-floor and out of thy wine-press</i> (Deut. 15, 14).</i> Both a man and woman [owner is under the obligation to give parting gifts] but only a man can acquire a Hebrew slave while a woman cannot acquire a [male] Hebrew slave.
Two slaves should not be bought together, [so that a public sale should not be made with two slaves].<sup class="footnote-marker">7a</sup><i class="footnote">(7a) The words in brackets are added by MS.K. The term <i>ṭumaria</i>, translated ‘public sale’, is obscure but it seems to indicate that too much publicity attaches to the sale of two slaves at once. [Krauss, <i>Lehnwörter</i> reads either <span dir="rtl">טימיתא</span>, ‘price’ (p. 264) or <span dir="rtl">טימוס</span>, ‘tax’ (p. 263).]</i>
One who sells himself, one who runs away and one who gains his liberty by deduction of money does not receive parting gifts.
He who is sold for committing a theft should not be sold either in the market-place or in a bazaar, as it is stated, <i>For unto Me the children of Israel are servants</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 25, 55. They must be treated as human beings and not as chattels.</i>
If [an Israelite] sells himself to Gentiles, his relatives and the <i>Beth Din</i> are commanded to redeem him, but he is not commanded to redeem himself, as it is stated, <i>One of his brethren shall redeem him; or his uncle or his uncle’s son shall redeem him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 48f. E.V. <i>may redeem</i>. To make sense of this passage we must read ‘he is [also] commanded to redeem himself’ instead of ‘but he is not commanded to redeem himself’. R. Ishmael learns this by <i>a fortiori</i> reasoning and uses the verse <i>or if he be waxen rich</i>, etc., from which it might be learnt that he need not sell himself again in order to repay those who have redeemed him.</i> For R. Ishmael used to say: Seeing that others are commanded to redeem him must he not be commanded to redeem himself? [And if you ask] what do I make of the words, <i>Or if he be waxen rich, he shall redeem himself?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i></i> [The meaning is,] that just as if he redeems himself he does not return to servitude, so if others redeem him he does not return to servitude.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In order to repay them.</i> R. Jose the Galilean said: If the <i>Beth Din</i> [sell him he returns] to servitude,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">To refund the money.</i> but if relatives [redeem him it is] for his freedom; while R. ‘ Aḳiba said: If the <i>Beth Din</i> [redeem him it is] for his freedom but if relatives [redeem him he returns] to servitude.
If he stole two hundred [<i>zuz</i>] and his valuation<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">As a slave.</i> is only a <i>maneh</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">A hundred <i>zuz</i>.</i> he is sold and sold again.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Each time for his valuation of one hundred <i>zuz</i>. [The correct reading is probably ‘not sold again’, cf. Ḳid. 18a (Sonc. ed., p. 82, n. 3.)]</i> If he stole a <i>maneh</i> and his valuation is two hundred <i>zuz</i> he is not to be sold.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Since half of him cannot be sold (Ḳid. <i>loc. cit.</i>).</i> R. Eliezer said: In no case should he be sold unless his sale price and the amount of his theft are equal. He cannot be sold and sold again for the same theft and he returns [after his servitude] to the rank which he formerly held. This is the view of R. Meir; but R. Judah said: He does not return to the rank which he formerly held.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf. the discussion in Mak. 13a (Sonc. ed., p. 89). H has a different version of this paragraph: ‘If one has stolen a <i>maneh</i> and his valuation is a <i>maneh</i>, or [if he stole] two hundred [<i>zuz</i>] and his valuation is two hundred [<i>zuz</i>], he may be sold; but [if he stole] two hundred [<i>zuz</i>] and his valuation is a <i>maneh</i> he may not be sold. R. Eliezer said: He is not sold unless his sale price and his theft are equal. [If he stole] a hundred [<i>zuz</i>] and his valuation is two hundred [<i>zuz</i>], he may not be sold. He may not be sold and resold for another theft or for repayment of double (cf. Ex. 22, 3, 6, 8) or repayment of fourfold and fivefold (cf. <i>ibid.</i> XXI, 37). [After his servitude] he returns to the rank’, etc.]</i>

Chapter 3

The <i>nirẓa‘</i> should not have his ear pierced until he declares and repeats [his desire to remain in servitude], as it is stated, <i>But if the servant shall plainly say</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 21, 5. The Heb. is lit. ‘saying shall say’, i.e. say and say again.</i> If the slave has a wife and children but the master has no wife and children, or if the master has a wife and children and the slave has no wife and children, he should not have his ear pierced. That is the view of R. Ishmael; R. ‘Aḳiba said: In either case he should have his ear pierced.<br>Anything may be used for the piercing, even a scissors,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Another reading is ‘nail’.</i> but [the proper instrument for] the command to pierce is an awl, as it is stated, <i>And his master shall bore his ear through with an awl</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 6.</i> He should only be pierced at the top of the ear according to R. Meir; but R. Judah said: He can be pierced also on the flap. He should be pierced only in the right ear in the presence of the <i>Beth Din</i>, as it is stated, <i>Then his master shall bring him unto the</i> Elohim.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid. Elohim</i> is understood as ‘judges’.</i> Both <i>door</i> and <i>doorpost</i> are mentioned [in the verse]; why are they both mentioned? It is to compare the door to the doorpost: as the doorpost is upright, so the door must be upright.
A Canaanite slave<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Any heathen slave was called ‘Canaanite’ with reference to Gen. 9, 25.</i> is acquired by money payment, by written deed or by seizure, and he acquires his liberty with money which is paid [to his master] by others or with a written document which he receives [from him]. Such is the opinion of R. Meir; but the Sages said: [He acquires liberty] with money which he himself pays or with a deed received for him by others, provided only that the money belongs to others.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Because everything possessed by a Canaanite slave belongs, to his master.</i>
He goes free for loss of a limb<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ex. 21, 26f.</i>—for an eye or a tooth, for the tips of the ears, for the tips of the fingers and toes, for the tip of the nose, for the tip of the membrum and for the tips of the breasts in a woman. R. Simeon said: [The last-mentioned applies also] to a man.
If [the master] knocks out two of his teeth together, or blinds his two eyes together, he goes free but receives no compensation; if they were knocked out at different times, he gains his liberty for the first and receives monetary compensation for the second. If [the master] cut off some of his flesh or knocked out a tooth which was about to fall out, he does not go free.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Because the flesh would grow again and a slave was liberated only for losses which would not grow again like an ordinary tooth or an eye. MS.K. inserts the sentence: ‘[A slave] can be emancipated by an <span dir="rtl">אנטוקטא</span> or a board or a tablet, but not by a headgear [presented by] kings’. [This addition is a variant of what occurs in Giṭ. 20a (Sonc. ed., p. 77). See there n. 6. Krauss (<i>Lenhwörter</i> I, pp. 267f., and his <i>Talmudische Archäologie</i> II, p. 99) gives a detailed discussion of the reading in MS.K. and quotes the view that it enumerates the Roman methods of manumission and the terms correspond to the Latin <i>manumissio per vindictam, per censum, per tabulas</i> and <i>manumissio in praesentia regis</i>.]</i>
A slave of whom an Israelite is part-owner<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">While the other half is free.</i> is [reckoned as] a free man.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. his master must liberate him.</i>
If one sells his slave after thirty days,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">This is meaningless. Kirchheim emends, in accordance with B.Ḳ. 90a (Sonc. ed., p. 519): ‘If one sells his slave to another with the stipulation that he should still serve him for thirty days, R. Meir says’, etc.</i> R. Meir says that [the first owner has the benefit of the law of] <i>a day or two</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The law that if an owner strikes his slave and he survives a day or two days the owner is not punished.</i> but not the second. [R. Judah says: The second also has the benefit.]<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The sentence in brackets is added in MS.K</i> R. Eliezer said: Neither has the benefit of <i>a day or two</i>.
Whoever sells his slave to a Gentile or [to an Israelite] outside the Land [of Israel], or one who goes free for the loss of a limb, [the slave] does not require a deed of manumission. R. ‘Aḳiba says that he does require a deed of manumission.
