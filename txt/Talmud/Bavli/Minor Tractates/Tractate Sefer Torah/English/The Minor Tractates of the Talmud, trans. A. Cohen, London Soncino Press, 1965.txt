Tractate Sefer Torah



Chapter 1

It is not permitted to write a scroll of the Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The scroll of the Pentateuch used for the lections in public worship.</i> on skins of ritually unclean cattle or on skins of ritually unclean wild animals, nor may they<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The parchment sheets of which the scroll is made up.</i> be sewn with [their] sinews or [the parchment rolls of <i>tefillin</i>] be wound with their hair. It is an oral prescription delivered to Moses at Sinai that [these] shall be written on the skins of ritually clean cattle, or on skins of ritually clean wild animals, that they shall be sewn together with ritually clean sinews, [that the <i>tefillin</i> rolls] shall be wound with ritually clean hair, and that the writing be done with ink, because [this latter requirement] has support in Scripture, <i>And I wrote them with ink in the book</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Jer. 36, 18.</i>
It is permitted to write [sacred scrolls] on skins of <i>nebeloth</i> and on skins of <i>ṭerefoth</i> and there is no need to consider the possibility of their having been pierced at the animal’s heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">It was a heathen practice to remove the heart from a live animal to offer it as a sacrifice, and this, in Rabbinic law (Mishnah ‘A.Z. 29b, Sonc. ed., p. 145) rendered the entire animal, including its skin, forbidden as an idolatrous offering.</i>
Skins<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Before they were dressed; but dressed skins may be bought only from trustworthy persons who can testify that the dressing had been done in accordance with the law.</i> for the [sacred] books, <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzoth</i> may be bought anywhere, and one need not consider the possibility that they might be skins that were pierced at the animal’s heart.
The writing on <i>ḳelaf</i> must be on the side of the flesh, and on <i>gewil</i> it must be on the side of the hair; and if one changed the one for the other [the scroll] may not be used for the lection [in the statutory services].
[Sacred texts]<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in Rule 1.</i> may not be written on <i>difthera</i>, a tablet or erased paper;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Others ‘palimpsest’. GRA in Sof. I, 5 omits ‘erased’.</i> nor with coal,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Or, ‘black pigment’.</i> shoe-black, or ink containing gum or vitriol. Vitriol may not be added to the ink.
R. Jacob said in the name of R. Meir: Vitriol may be added to the ink. R. Judah said: R. Meir’s statement about [writing with ink containing] vitriol applies to [the whole] Torah<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. ‘Erub. 13a [Sonc. ed., p. 82).</i> except the section dealing with a suspected wife.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 5, 11ff.</i> R. Jacob retorted: [R. Meir] said, ‘Except the section dealing with a suspected wife’, [by which he meant that] only in the special scroll<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A small scroll on which were written the curses that would befall an unfaithful wife.</i> which [was used] in the Temple [must the ink contain no vitriol] because [the writing] had to be blotted out.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Num. <i>ibid.</i> 23f.</i>
R. Simeon b. Laḳish said in the name of R. Meir, who had it from R. Ishmael, that vitriol may be added to the ink.
[Sacred texts]<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Mentioned in Rule 1.</i> may not be written in [obsolete] Hebrew characters or in the Median, Elamitic or Greek languages.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">According to Meg. 9a (Sonc. ed., p. 48) it is permitted to write the Torah in Greek, though this is not allowed in the case of <i>tefillin</i> and <i>mezuzoth</i>.</i> Seventy Elders wrote the Torah for king Ptolemy<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Assumed to be Ptolemy Philadelphus who reigned in Egypt, 285-247 <small>B.C.E.</small>, and who arranged for the Greek Version, the Septuagint, to be made, as narrated in Sof. I, 8 (cf. the notes <i>ad loc.</i>).</i> in Greek, and that day was as ominous for Israel as the day on which the Golden Calf was made, since the Torah could not be adequately translated.
They [all] introduced [the same] thirteen alterations:<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">For a comparison of these variants with the Heb. text, cf. on Sof. I, 8.</i> ‘God created in the beginning’; ‘I shall make a man in image and likeness’; ‘And He finished on the sixth [day] and rested on the seventh [day]’; ‘Male and female He created him’; ‘Come let Me go down’; ‘And Sarah laughed among her relatives, saying’; ‘For in their anger they slew oxen and in their self-will they digged up a stall’; ‘And Moses took his wife and his children and set them upon a carrier of men’; ‘Now the time that the children of Israel dwelt in the land of Canaan and in the land of Egypt was four hundred and thirty years’; ‘I have not taken one desirable thing from them’; ‘And the [beast] with small legs’; ‘Which the Lord thy God hath allotted unto all the peoples to give light under the whole heaven’; ‘And they offer sacrifices to the sun or the moon or any of the host of heaven which I commanded should not be served’.
[Sacred scrolls] must not be written in gold. It is related that, in an Alexandrian scroll<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. note to Sof. I, 9.</i> of the Torah, the divine names were written in gold, and when the matter came before the Sages they decided that it should be stored away.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘it shall be hidden’, i.e. not used for the lections.</i>
If Hebrew words were written in Aramaic or Aramaic words in Hebrew, if <i>Ha’azinu</i> was written in continuous lines,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sof. I, 10, n. 44, for the correct arrangement.</i> or if the breaking up [of the lines] was not done according to the rule, the scroll may not be used for the lections.
If one finished [writing nearly] all the scroll [of the Torah] and less than a column of text remained, one need not hesitate to extend the writing so as to make of this a small column on its own.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">The extension of a short passage over a full column is done either by enlarging the characters or, according to others, by making each successive line shorter than the one preceding it.</i>
If an open section was written as a closed one or <i>vice versa</i>, the scroll must be stored away. What is an open section? One which commences at the beginning of a line. How much space must there be at the end of a line so that the section beginning at the next line may be called an open one? A space on which may be written a name of three letters.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The opinion of Maimonides, which has been adopted, is that space must be left for three words, each of three letters (cf. Y.D. CCLXXV, §2).</i>
Should an entire section be finished at the end of a column, if one [blank] line remained and [the next] section is a closed one, [the scribe] begins it in the middle of the line; but if it is an open section, he begins at the top [of the next column] and leaves that line [blank].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sof. I, 14.</i>

Chapter 2

Sufficient space must be left between words<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘between name and name’.</i> so that they may be distinguished, and between letters so that they be not mixed. If the letters were mixed up or a break made in the middle of a word, the scroll must not be used for the lection in the statutory services.
[It is permitted] to insert between columns two letters from a long word, but not from a short one. If, however, [the part of a longer word forms] a short word on its own,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">e.g. in a word like <i>yimlok</i> (he will reign) the last two letters can form an independent short word <i>lak</i> (to thee).</i> it is forbidden [to insert it between the columns].
In a Torah scroll the space of two finger-breadths must be left [between columns], but in scrolls of the Prophets and in those of Pentateuchs<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Intended for ordinary reading or study, and not for the public lections.</i> a space of one thumb-breadth [only].
In the lower margin of a Torah scroll the space of a handbreadth is left, and in the upper margin two-thirds of a handbreadth;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘two parts of a handbreadth’. This is also the reading of V and M in Sof. II, 4. According to Men. 30a (Sonc. ed., p. 195) and H in Sof. <i>loc. cit.</i> the upper margin must be three finger-breadths wide.</i> but in scrolls of the Prophets and Pentateuchs three finger-breadths in the lower margin and two finger-breadths in the upper. In all these cases<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘here and there’.</i> if it is desired to extend [the margins] this may be done, provided they do not exceed [the space of] the written matter.
Between the books in a Torah scroll a vacant space of four lines must be left, and in a scroll containing the Twelve Prophets three lines.<br>At the end of a scroll and at its beginning sufficient [parchment] must be left to wind<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Reading with many authorities <i>lehaḳḳif</i>. V reads <i>lehaḳim</i> ‘to raise up’.</i> [it round the scroll]. In a Torah scroll no limit has been prescribed, but a roller should be attached at the end of the scroll and there is no need to do this at its beginning.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">This regulation does not agree with Sof. II, 5.</i>
A sheet of a Torah scroll must contain not less than three columns and not more than eight. In the case of <i>ḳelaf</i> parchments no limit was prescribed, [62<i>b</i>] and one may add [as many columns] as desired provided only there are not less than three columns [to the sheet].
If one finished [writing nearly] all the book<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This refers either to one book of the Prophets or to several of them written in one scroll.</i> and one column of text remained, one need not hesitate to make of it a separate small sheet.
If a sheet [of a Torah scroll] is worn out, one may not remove two [columns only] and replace them by two new columns; but three columns should be removed and replaced by three new ones, and the new columns must be written in the same size as the original script.
The width of a column [in a Torah scroll] must be such as to be recognizable at one glance,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Accordingly, not more than three Hebrew words, each of ten letters, may be written in a line. If the column is wider, the reader experiences difficulty in passing from line to line.</i> and in a small scroll not less than a handbreadth. R. Jose b. Judah says: It must not be less than the width of three fingers.
The height<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘length’.</i> of [a scroll] must not be greater than its circumference,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">When rolled up, so according to B.B. 14a (Sonc. ed., p. 67); lit. ‘its width’.</i> nor its circumference greater than its height, but they must be exactly alike,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘takes the middle course’.</i> and this is the most correct procedure.
A Torah scroll may not consist half of <i>gewil</i> [and half of <i>ḳelaf</i>, but it may consist half of <i>gewil</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">The words of this Rule enclosed within square brackets are added from Sof. II, 10, <i>q.v.</i> If ‘although’ is altered to ‘because’, the text will make sense but will be contrary to the Rule in Sof. <i>loc. cit.</i></i> and half [of the <i>ḳelaf</i>] of deers, although this is not the best procedure.
[A tear in a Torah parchment sheet] may not be joined with glue, nor is it permitted to write on a patch, nor may [the sheets] be sewn together on the written side. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said in the name of R. Meir: [A torn sheet] may be joined with glue and it is permitted to write on a patch, but it is forbidden to do the sewing<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">So according to GRA, H and M in Sof. II, 11. V reads here as in Sof. ‘the writing’.</i> on the written side. If a scroll<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Other than a Torah scroll.</i> is torn, a patch may be placed on the outside.

Chapter 3

It is permissible to join the Torah and the Prophets in one scroll, according to R. Judah; but the Sages say: The Torah and the Prophets must be written in separate scrolls.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">According to GRA (in Sof. III, 1) who adopted the reading of B.B. 13b (Sonc. ed., p. 66): ‘it is permissible to fasten the Torah, the Prophets and the Hagiographa together (in one scroll)’.</i>
Between a book of the Prophets and another one should not leave the same [empty space] as between two books of the Torah; but in each case the space must be that which has been prescribed for it.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. four lines between books of the Torah and three between the books of the Prophets.</i> Furthermore [a book of the Prophets]<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">If the preceding book ended at the foot of a column.</i> must begin at the top.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Of the next column, the reason being that, if the books of the Prophets were separated one from the other, the beginning of each book would commence at the top of a column. This does not apply to Torah scrolls, which may never be cut up into separate books.</i>
A Torah scroll<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Which contains all the five books of Moses.</i> may not be made into [separate] books of the Pentateuch, because it is forbidden to reduce a major sanctity<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah scroll in its entirety.</i> to a minor sanctity.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A section of the Pentateuch.</i> From scrolls containing sections of the Pentateuch, however, it is permitted to make up a Torah scroll. When may this be done? When the measurements<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Of all the scrolls that are to be joined together.</i> and the number of the lines<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In each column.</i> are alike.<br>It is not permissible to join together two sections of the Pentateuch or one and a half of them to form a single scroll.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Since it might be mistaken for a proper Torah scroll.</i> But if it was intended<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">When these were written.</i> that additional scrolls be attached to them,<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">To complete a full Torah scroll.</i> it is permissible.
If a Torah scroll has spaces or stops [to mark] the beginning of verses, it may not be used for the lections.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Because all proper Torah scrolls must conform to the original without any deviations.</i> [Similarly] if a letter has been engraved or joined to another, the scroll may not be used for the lections.
A scroll [some of whose letters] are faded may not be used for the public lections.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">So H and GRA in Sof. III, 8. V reads ‘one shall not rewrite [the letters] in it’.</i> R. Simeon b. Eleazar says: If the outline [of the effaced letters] is distinguishable, it is permitted [to rewrite them].
A scroll of the Torah in which a whole line<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reading in Sof. III, 9. V reads here ‘one letter’.</i> is faded may not be used. If the greater part of a line is faded and the smaller part intact, the use of the scroll is permitted.
Not more than four<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">And not less than three (cf. Sof. III, 10).</i> columns of the Torah scroll may be unrolled [at one time during the reading of the lection] but there is no objection to the reading of ten [columns] in one [lection].
A scribe may not put upon the written part [of a Torah scroll] a reed-pen with ink on it;<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">So according to Sof. III, 11. The text in V is meaningless.</i> nor may he take hold of the sheets of parchment and thereby unroll [the scroll]; nor may he<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reading in Sof. III, 11. V reads ‘but he should’.</i> grasp the parchments to extract the written sheets;<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Which are rolled up; lit. ‘and bring forth the writing without’.</i> nor may he remove a scroll from its [case] by shaking it out. All these [restrictions], however, are relaxed in the case of official revisers of Scriptural scrolls.
It is not permissible to place a Torah scroll on a chair and to lean on it with one’s elbows while reading; so according to R. Nehemiah. It is not permissible to place it over a chair [with its sheets] hanging down while it is read in the manner of ordinary documents, because [sacred] books must not be treated with disrespect.
A Torah scroll may not be placed on a bed and [certainly]<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. N.Y. on Sof. III, 13. The insertion of ‘certainly’ avoids an anticlimax.</i> not at its foot or under it; nor may one sit<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘that one may sit’.</i> on a bed while a [Torah] scroll rests on it. It is related that R. Eliezer<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In Sof. III, 13, ‘R. Eleazar’.</i> once sat [unknowingly] on a bed on which a [Torah] scroll lay, and [when he realized it] he jumped up as if a snake had bitten him. [Such respect is shown for the Torah] because Scripture declares, <i>Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 19, 30.</i>—it is not the Sabbaths that one reverences but Him Who commanded [to observe them], for Scripture declares, <i>This is my God, and I will glorify Him</i><sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 15, 2.</i> [which means,]<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Connecting <i>we’anwehu</i> (<i>I will glorify Him</i>) homiletically with <i>na’eh</i> (beautiful) and understanding it as ‘I will serve Him in a beautiful manner’.</i> I will perform the commandment in a beautiful way to His glory.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘before Him’.</i> Such is the interpretation of R. Ishmael. R. ‘Aḳiba expounds it: I will expatiate on His excellencies.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <i>na’oth</i>, lit. ‘beauties’, excellent attributes.</i> Abba Saul explains it: I will be like Him,<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">He explains <i>we’anwehu</i> as the equivalent of <i>’ani wahu</i> (I and He).</i> i.e. as He is gracious and merciful so be thou gracious and merciful.
Foodstuffs may not be treated with disrespect. One may not sit on a basket containing dates or dried figs;<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Because they might be crushed and spoilt.</i> but he may sit on a basket that contains pulse and also on a cake of pressed figs, because it is customary to do so in such cases.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Pulse and dried figs are not spoilt by sitting on them.</i>
Foodstuffs may not be used as a covering. R. Meir says: Any fruit which has a husk may be [used as a covering]. R. Judah says: Any fruit which has a stem or a stalk<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Whereby it can be lifted if it should happen to fall into the contents of the vessel it covered.</i> may be [used as a covering].<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Since it would not be necessary to throw it away after use.</i> Foodstuffs may not be eaten with the aid of foodstuffs<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Using them, e.g., in place of a spoon.</i> unless they are consumed simultaneously.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">And would not be thrown away.</i>

Chapter 4

The following divine names may not be erased, viz.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘he who writes’.</i> <i>Alef-lamed-he-yod-mem</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning ‘God’.</i> <i>Alef-daleth-nun-yod</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Translated ‘Lord’.</i> <i>Yod-he-waw-he</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Composing the Tetragrammaton.</i> <i>Shaddai</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. ‘Almighty’.</i> <i>Ẓeba’oth</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning ‘[Lord of] hosts’.</i> <i>‘Eheyeh-’asher-’eheyeh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>I am that I am</i> (Ex. 3, 14).</i> R. Jose says: <i>Ẓeba’oth</i> is generally treated as a secular noun.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Which may therefore be erased.</i>
If one writes <i>’El</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">It can mean ‘to’ or ‘God’ so far as the consonants are concerned.</i> it may be erased;<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">It is presumed to be the preposition ‘to’. This Rule is omitted in Sof. IV, 2.</i> if <i>’El</i> of <i>Alef-lamed-he-yod-mem</i> or <i>Yod-he</i> of the four letters [of the Tetragrammaton],<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Which are <i>Yod-he-waw-he</i>.</i> they may not be erased, because there are divine names corresponding to them.
All prefixes or suffixes connected with a divine name may be erased.
All ordinary words the letters of which are the same as those of a divine name may be erased.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Because they possess no sanctity.</i>
In <i>For the Lord your God, He is God of gods</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 10, 17.</i> the first [two]<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. <i>your God He is God</i>.</i> are sacred and the last<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Of gods</i>, signifying ‘judges’ or ‘princes’.</i> is secular. In <i>Lord of lords</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i></i> the first is sacred and the second secular. In <i>the God of Abraham</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 31, 53.</i> it is sacred; in <i>the god of Nahor</i><sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> Nahor did not worship the true God.</i> it is secular, and in <i>the god of their father</i><sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> Terah (<i>their father</i>) was an idolater.</i> it is secular. In <i>Thou shalt not revile God</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 22, 27.</i> [the noun may bear] a sacred or a secular meaning.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">It may refer to God or judges.</i> R. Ishmael<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">In Sof. IV, 5, ‘R. Simeon’.</i> maintains that the noun is sacred.
All nouns in the Torah [signifying God] that are mentioned in connection with Abraham are sacred except the first.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">The verse, <i>And he said: My lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight</i> (Gen. 18, 3), because <i>my lord</i> was addressed to the leader of the three angels</i> R. Ḥanina the son of R. Joshua’s brother holds that it is sacred.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In his opinion <i>my Lord</i> was addressed to God.</i>
All names in the Torah mentioned in connection with Lot are secular<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">There is only one secular name in the Lot passages, and the Tetragrammaton occurs twice. The word ‘all’ is not intended to be taken literally (cf. N.Y. on Sof. IV, 7).</i> except the last.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Viz. <i>And Lot said unto them: ‘Oh, not so my Lord’</i> (Gen. 19, 18). Lot’s address to the angels is understood as ending at <i>not so</i>, and his petition to God then begins, <i>My Lord, behold</i>, etc. [So the Targum and Shebu. 35b, Sonc. ed., pp. 205f.]</i> [All names] in the story of Micah<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Judg. 17f.</i> are secular, even [when they begin with] <i>Yod-he</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">The Tetragrammaton.</i> In [the account of] Naboth<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">1 Kings 21.</i> they are sacred even [when they begin with] <i>Alef-lamed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Meaning elsewhere ‘God’.</i>
In <i>God standeth in the congregation of God, in the midst of the judges</i><sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The Heb. has the consonants of the divine name.</i> <i>He judges</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 82, 1.</i> [the divine name] is used as sacred<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">In <i>God standeth</i>.</i> and as secular.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">The name bearing the meaning of judges.</i> In <i>God delivereth me to</i><sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <i>’el</i> (to) which is the same consonants as the word for ‘God’.</i> <i>the ungodly</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Job 16, 11.</i> the first is sacred and the second<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>’el</i> in the sense of ‘to’.</i> secular.

In <i>God hath given command to speed me</i><sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">2 Chron. 35, 21.</i> [the name] is sacred. In <i>Forbear thee from meddling with God, Who is with me</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i></i> the name is sacred, according to the view of R. Jose b. Judah. In <i>O God, the proud are risen up against me</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 86, 14.</i> the name is sacred but the reader must pause in his reading [after <i>God</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">In the absence of the pause, the adjective <i>proud</i> might erroneously be taken as qualifying God.</i>

Chapter 5

If [a scribe] wrote a sacred name twice,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘he who writes two sacred names’.</i> he retains the first and erases the latter.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The first is retained because it was properly written; the second is erased because it was written in error.</i> R. Judah says: If the latter occurred at the end of a column, he erases the first and retains the latter.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">[In Sof. V, 1, the reading is: ‘R. Judah says: If the first occurs at the end of a column’. Here H reads: ‘If the latter occurs at the beginning of a column’. Either of these must be substituted for V because the idea is that] it spoils the appearance to leave a blank space at the beginning of the top line of a column.</i>
If [the scribe wrote] a secular noun twice,<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘two secular names’.</i> he retains the first and wipes away the latter.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">While the ink is still wet.</i> R.

If a scribe writes <i>Yehudah</i> and omits the <i>daleth</i> he inserts it above the line. If he intended to write the Tetragrammaton<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The four-lettered name <i>Yod-he-waw-he</i>. Lit. ‘the name, he wrote the name’, apparently a misprint.</i> and wrote <i>Yehudah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Yod-he-waw-daleth-he</i>.</i> instead, he alters the <i>daleth</i> to <i>he</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">This is done by adding a short vertical line to the <i>daleth</i>.</i> and wipes away the final letter <i>he</i>.
If it was required to write <i>Yehudah</i> but [the scribe] intended to write the Tetragrammaton, although he [inadvertently] inserted the <i>daleth</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Thus writing the noun correctly but without intention.</i> he erases it and writes another <i>Yehudah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Because the writing must be both intentional and correct.</i>
If it was required to write the Tetragrammaton but [the scribe] intended to write <i>Yehudah</i>, although he inserted the <i>daleth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">So that <i>Yehudah</i> was not only intended but also written correctly, in the wrong place.

Judah says: He should [also] go over the entire name with the reed-pen and so sanctify it. The Sages said to him: This is not the best procedure.
If in writing the Tetragrammaton he made an error [by omitting] one letter he should suspend it above [the line]. If one erred [by omitting] all the name<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The Tetragrammaton.</i> he should suspend it between the lines. So R. Judah; R. Jose says: [The scribe] wipes away the letters preceding it, writes the Tetragrammaton [in their place] and suspends [above the line] the part which he had wiped away. R. Ḥananiah b. ‘Aḳashia says: All the sheet must be stored away.

When one is writing the Tetragrammaton, one may not respond even if the king greets him;<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">All one’s attention must be concentrated on the writing of the divine name.</i> but if one was about to write two or three divine names successively<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">e.g. <i>The Lord, the Lord, God</i> (Ex. 34, 6) or Deut. 6, 4.</i> one may pause between them and respond.

One who wipes away<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">In Sof. V, 6, ‘erases’.</i> a single letter of a divine name transgresses a negative commandment. R.
