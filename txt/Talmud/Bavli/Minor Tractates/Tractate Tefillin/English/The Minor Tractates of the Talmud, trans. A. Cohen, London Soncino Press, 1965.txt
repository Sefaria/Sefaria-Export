Tractate Tefillin



Chapter 1

It is not permitted to write [the four scrolls of] <i>tefillin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">These are specified below. Cf. also the Introduction.</i> on skins of ritually unclean cattle or on skins of ritually unclean wild animals. It is permitted, however, to write them on skins of <i>nebeloth</i> and <i>ṭerefoth</i> and there is no need to consider the possibility of their having been pierced at the animal’s heart.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">There was a heathen practice to remove the heart from an animal while it was still alive and offer it as a sacrifice. Rabbinic law regards such an animal as an idolatrous offering (cf. Mishnah ‘A.Z. 29b, Sonc. ed., p. 145) and forbids its entire use, including the skin.</i>
If [<i>tefillin</i> scrolls] were perforated, they become unfit for religious use [if the hole occurred] in the written part; but if it occurred in the margin they remain fit. If the letter <i>waw</i> was shaped like a <i>zayin</i> or <i>vice versa</i>, straight-lined letters like curved ones<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The final <i>kaf</i>, e.g., like an ordinary <i>kaf.</i></i> or <i>vice versa</i>, open letters closed<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Such as an ordinary <i>mem</i> like a final <i>mem.</i></i> or <i>vice versa</i>, or if the shape of their letters had been altered [in any other way], or if they were written in [obsolete] Hebrew, or were made as a kind of amulet—they are unfit for religious use.
Women, slaves and minors<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Boys under thirteen years of age. On the exemption of women, cf. <i>Ẓiẓith</i> §1.</i> are exempt from [the commandment of] <i>tefillin</i>. A minor who knows how to take care of his <i>tefillin</i> is subject to the law of <i>tefillin</i>. It is related that Ṭabi, R. Gamaliel’s slave, used to put on <i>tefillin;</i> Michal, Saul’s daughter, used to put on <i>tefillin;</i> Jonah’s wife used to make the festival pilgrimages<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">[For Ṭabi, cf. j.‘Erub. X, I, 26a; for the two women, cf. ‘Erub. 96a (Sonc. ed., p. 665).]</i> to Jerusalem.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Although the commandment applied only to males (cf. Ex. 34, 23).</i>
[Regarding] the bearers of a bier [to the burial place] and those who relieve them<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In carrying the bier.</i> and those who relieve the latter, whether in front of the bier or behind the bier<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Who have not yet carried it or have done so respectively.</i>—all who are required [to carry] the bier are exempt<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This is in disagreement with the ruling in the Mishnah (Ber. 17b, Sonc. ed., p. 106) where only those who are in front of the bier are exempt if they are required to carry it. Those behind are always liable even if their help is required, since they had already done their duty to the dead (cf. Rashi <i>ad loc.</i>).</i> [from putting on <i>tefillin</i>], but those who are not required for the bier are liable. When a halt is made for lamentations,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">A number of such halts were made by those who returned from a burial to the mourner’s house. (Cf. Semaḥoth X.]</i> those who are engaged in the lamentations are exempt, but those<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">In the back rows when they stand several deep.</i> who cannot see<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">So in accordance with Ber. 19b (Sonc. ed., p. 117). V reads ‘those who see’.</i> the inside [space between the rows]<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Where the mourner is.</i> are liable.
If a person says [to another], ‘Come and read [a Scriptural text] over my son because he is frightened’, or ‘Write, or place, upon him a [holy] scroll’, or ‘Put <i>tefillin</i> upon him that he may sleep’,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">This is the reading in j.Shab. VI, 2, 8b. The text in V is corrupt.</i> he should not be listened to.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Because sacred objects should not be used for such purposes. Cf. Sanh. 101a (Sonc. ed., p. 684, nn. 6f.).</i>
A <i>tefillah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">V has the plural form.</i> is susceptible of ritual uncleanness. [If it becomes unclean, the priest] sprinkles upon it [the water of the red heifer]<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Num. 19.</i> and repeats the process, and then immerses it [in a ritual bath]. R. Ḥanina b. Gamaliel says: It is necessary to unloose it.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">To remove the stitches that hold the parts of the capsule together, in order that the water may penetrate to all parts.</i> If [a <i>tefillah</i>] fell into water and remained there long enough [for the writing] to be washed away, it should be subjected to an examination.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">To make sure that the writing is still in a good condition or to repair it if necessary.</i>
Straps of <i>tefillin</i> may be bought anywhere.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">There is no need, as in the case with the <i>tefillin</i>, to buy them from a reliable person.</i> R. Simeon b. Gamaliel says: Any skin that had been used [for a secular] purpose is forbidden [to be used for the straps of <i>tefillin</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Hence they must be bought only from a reliable person who can guarantee that no previous use had been made of the skin.</i>
<i>Tefillin</i> may be bought only from a reliable person;<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">One who can testify that they were prepared in accordance with the law.</i> and where there is no reliable person a pair of <i>tefillin</i> should be given [to an expert] who examines them. This does not mean that the seller gives him the scrolls, but that he himself chooses what he pleases and has them examined.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘that he takes for himself and he examines’.</i> If on examination the selected <i>tefillin</i> prove to be fit,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘he examined and found as proper’.</i> he may take all the batch without any scruples.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The fitness of the sample is assumed to represent the fitness of the whole batch.</i>
The [sections of the] head-<i>tefillah</i> are written on four separate scrolls<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘sections’.</i> [beginning with] <i>Sanctify unto Me;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 13, 1-10.</i> <i>And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 11-16.</i> <i>Hear;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 6, 4-9.</i> <i>And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XI, 13-21.</i> So also with the hand-<i>tefillah</i>, except that [all the four sections] are written in one scroll.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘he makes one section’.</i> If one wrote them in four separate scrolls [the <i>tefillah</i>] is fit for religious use. R. Judah says: They should be sewn together and put into one capsule.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Unlike the head-<i>tefillah</i>, which consists of four compartments joined together to form one capsule.</i> R. Judah, however, admits that if two <i>tefillin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘both of them’.</i> were [like] the head-<i>tefillah</i>, one may wrap one of them in a piece of leather and so convert it into a hand-<i>tefillah</i>.
The hand-<i>tefillah</i> is put on the upper part of the hand<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">The biceps, and not on the palm of the hand.</i> [because Scripture declares, <i>And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 13, 9.</i> which means that the sign shall be for thee<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Where only he who wears the <i>tefillah</i> can see it, i.e. on the biceps covered by the sleeve.</i> but not for others<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Had the <i>tefillah</i> been put on the palm of the hand it would be visible to all.</i>]. <sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The part enclosed in square brackets is based on Men. 37b (Sonc. ed., p. 229).</i>So also [the Scriptural expression] <i>between thine eyes</i><sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 13, 9.</i> [implies] the upper part of the head, [because] <i>upon thy hand</i> and <i>between thine eyes</i> [occur in juxtaposition we infer]: as <i>upon thy hand</i> [means] on the upper part of the hand, so <i>between thine eyes</i> [means] on the upper part of the head. This is according to R. Eliezer b. Jacob; R. Judah says: It is stated <i>upon thy hand</i> and it is also stated [in the same verse] <i>between thine eyes</i> [the inference being that] as <i>upon thy hand</i> [refers to] a place that is susceptible of ritual uncleanness by one [symptom of] leprosy,<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The biceps, like any other part of the body that is free from hair, is declared ritually unclean by one symptom only, viz. white hair in the leprous spot.</i> so also <i>between thine eyes</i> [refers to] a place that is susceptible of ritual uncleanness by one [symptom of] leprosy.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Viz. the upper part of the head, whose symptom of uncleanness is yellow hair in the leprous spot. The region between the eyes, however, where both hair and clean flesh are to be found, can be declared unclean by either of the two symptoms (yellow or white hair) and must therefore be ruled out.</i> [Another reason:] It is stated <i>between thine eyes</i> and it is also stated, <i>Nor make any baldness between your eyes:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 14, 1.</i> as baldness occurs where there is hair [on the head] so you must put the <i>tefillah</i> only where there is hair [on the hand].<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Since both verses contain the expression <i>between … eyes</i>.</i> It is stated, <i>And thou shalt write them</i><sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Referring to the <i>mezuzah</i> (Deut. 6, 9).</i> and it is also stated [in juxtaposition] <i>and thou shalt bind them;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">The <i>tefillin</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 8).</i> [hence the inference that] the hand that writes [the <i>mezuzah</i>]<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the right hand, with which most people write.</i> is the hand that binds [the <i>tefillah</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The hand-<i>tefillah</i> is therefore put on the left hand.</i>
The commandment of [wearing] <i>tefillin</i> is from dawn until evening. If a person sleeps in the day-time he need not trouble to remove his <i>tefillin</i>. If a man rises early to go on a journey, he should not put them on before the time [for the performance] of the commandment; but if he had put them on before [the proper time for the performance of] the commandment, he should place his hand upon them at the time [for the performance] of the commandment<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">At dawn.</i> and say the benedictions.
[Absence of] the hand-<i>tefillah</i> does not prevent the religious use of the head-<i>tefillah</i>, neither does [the absence of] the head-<i>tefillah</i> prevent the religious use of the hand-<i>tefillah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Each <i>tefillah</i> is independent of the other.</i> If a man inverted a <i>tefillah</i> capsule<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">When it is on his hand or head.</i> he has not fulfilled his religious duty.<br>When a man puts on [the <i>tefillin</i>], he should put on that of the hand first; and when he takes them off, he should take off that of the head first. A similar rule applies in the case of sandals, viz. when he puts them on, he should put on that of the right foot first, and when he takes them off, he should take off that of the left foot first.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf. DER. X, 1.]</i> Likewise, any [dish] that is served last<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Another and better reading is ‘first’.</i> is removed first, except bread.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Which must remain on the table until the Grace after meals had been recited (cf. Sanh. 92a, Sonc. ed., p. 617).</i>
If a man makes his head-[<i>tefillah</i>] round, this is a dangerous practice<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote">Because an accidental blow on it might split one’s head. Cf. Meg. 24b (Sonc. ed., p. 148, n. 2).</i> which does not carry with it [the fulfilment of] the commandment.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote">The commandment being that it must be cube-shaped and flat at the base.</i> To put [the head-<i>tefillah</i>] on one’s forehead or [the hand-<i>tefillah</i>] on the palm of one’s hand<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">In accordance with the literal meaning of the verse, <i>And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes</i> (Deut. 6, 8), which is contrary to the traditional interpretation.</i> is in the manner of heresy.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">Heb. <i>minuth</i>, used especially of the views and practices of the early Jewish-Christians. According to Maimonides the <i>minim</i> were Sadducees.</i> To overlay them with gold or put [that of the hand] on one’s <i>neḳlah</i>, which means a sleeve, is the manner of the outsiders.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Persons who follow their own interpretation of Scripture and not that of the Rabbis. [On this paragraph, cf. J. Rabbinowitz, <i>Mishnah Megillah</i>, pp. 128f.]</i> [63<i>a</i>]
<i>Tefillin</i> may be moved within a house [even on the Sabbath].<sup class="footnote-marker">60</sup><i class="footnote">They are not regarded as articles forbidden to be handled on the Sabbath or Festival, although not worn on the holy days.</i> If [on the Sabbath day] a man finds <i>tefillin</i> in a public domain,<sup class="footnote-marker">61</sup><i class="footnote">Where they may be trodden upon.</i> he should carry them [into a safe place] one pair at a time.<sup class="footnote-marker">62</sup><i class="footnote">The hand-<i>tefillah</i> on his arm and the head-<i>tefillah</i> on his head in the same manner as they are worn on week-days.</i> R. Gamaliel says: Two pairs at a time.<sup class="footnote-marker">63</sup><i class="footnote">As there is sufficient room on the arm and on the head for two sets, he may put two hand-<i>tefillin</i> on his arm and two head-<i>tefillin</i> on his head.</i> [This rule applies to] both men and women,<sup class="footnote-marker">64</sup><i class="footnote">Although the latter are exempt from the commandment of <i>tefillin</i>.</i> to new <i>tefillin</i> and to old. R. Judah says: [This procedure] is permitted with old <i>tefillin</i><sup class="footnote-marker">65</sup><i class="footnote">Which show marks of wear or have a proper knot, so that there can be no doubt that they were genuine <i>tefillin</i>.</i> but forbidden with new.<sup class="footnote-marker">66</sup><i class="footnote">Since they may be only amulets.</i>
If a man finds a [Torah] scroll or a bundle of <i>tefillin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">In a public domain where they may be trodden upon.</i> he should pass them on to his fellow, and his fellow should pass them on to his fellow on the Sabbath,<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Each one carrying them a lesser distance than four cubits. Carrying an article a longer distance in a public domain is forbidden on the Sabbath.</i> even though they be a hundred persons. If [there is no other person]<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote">The words in square brackets are missing in V but inserted by H.</i> with him, he<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘one [man]’.</i> should take them up [while standing] within four cubits [distance from them] and remove them to [the next point] within four cubits [distance from the first point];<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote">And so on, until he reaches a place where they can be properly deposited.</i> because R. Simeon said: Any prohibition<sup class="footnote-marker">72</sup><i class="footnote">Read <i>’issur</i> with H instead of <i>‘omed</i> (standing) in V.</i> imposed by a Rabbinical Court<sup class="footnote-marker">73</sup><i class="footnote">Such as the prohibition to carry objects in a public domain even within a distance of four cubits.</i> does not apply to holy writings.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Consequently it is permitted on the Sabbath to carry a Torah scroll or <i>tefillin</i> to a place of safety, provided all the stages between the points of taking up and setting down are each less than four cubits in length.</i><br>If a man is in a school house or in a House of Study,<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Places in which the <i>tefillin</i> would not be sufficiently protected if left there.</i> [or] in a privy or a bath-house,<sup class="footnote-marker">76</sup><i class="footnote">It would be disrespectful for the <i>tefillin</i> to be left there.</i> and forgot to remove his <i>tefillin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">77</sup><i class="footnote">Before the Sabbath had commenced, or before he entered the two last-mentioned places.</i> he should cover them with his hair<sup class="footnote-marker">78</sup><i class="footnote">So as not to be seen wearing <i>tefillin</i> on the Sabbath in public.</i> and leave the place.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Taking them off when he reaches his home.</i> If he is unable to do so, he should proceed to a near-by house where he takes them off.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Leaving them there until the termination of the Sabbath.</i>
[<i>Tefillin</i>] may be put into a money-bag even when there is money in it. They may also be suspended from the legs of a bed; but if another person<sup class="footnote-marker">81</sup><i class="footnote">A variant reading is: ‘if his wife be with him’.</i> be with him [in bed] it is forbidden. They must not be placed under one’s head;<sup class="footnote-marker">82</sup><i class="footnote">To sleep on them; and much more so under any other part of the body.</i> but if thereby they are protected<sup class="footnote-marker">83</sup><i class="footnote">From thieves or disrespectful treatment.</i> it is permitted.<br>If a man carried a heavy load<sup class="footnote-marker">84</sup><i class="footnote">[This and the following regulations applied at the time when the <i>tefillin</i> were worn throughout the day and not, as now, only during the morning prayers.]</i> and was perspiring, he need not trouble to remove his <i>tefillin</i>. A potter should remove the hand-<i>tefillah</i> but wear the head-<i>tefillah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">Since his work requires the use of his hands only.</i> A baker should remove the head-<i>tefillah</i><sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Otherwise the heat of the oven might damage it.</i> and wear the hand-<i>tefillah;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote">Using his right hand for the baking.</i> but if he uses both hands in baking he also takes off the hand-<i>tefillah</i>.
[Regarding a bath-house], if a man is about to enter the room where persons are undressed, he removes his <i>tefillin</i> at a distance of four cubits from the nude persons. If some are undressed and others dressed, he does not remove his <i>tefillin</i> but should not put them on at the outset.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote">So according to H. V reads: ‘he shall not remove them at the outset’.</i>
If a person is about to enter a tannery,<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">Where there are unpleasant smells.</i> a pond [enclosure]<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote">For steeping flax or similar things.</i> or a wash-house, he removes his <i>tefillin</i> at a distance of four cubits. If a person is about to enter a privy, he removes the <i>tefillin</i> at a distance of four cubits. If it was a superior bathing-place,<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf. Tamid I, 1, Sonc. ed., p. 2, where the Temple was said to have ‘a superior privy’, its superiority being that it could be locked to prevent intrusion.]</i> one does not remove the <i>tefillin</i> before he reaches it.
It once happened that R. Eliezer went to Ubelin<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Or, ‘Obelin’. There was a village of that name near Jaffa in S. Palestine, and one near Sepphoris in Galilee. A visit by R. Eliezer to Obelin is mentioned in ‘Erub. 11b-12a (Sonc. ed., pp. 71f.).</i> [where he stayed] with a certain house-owner. It was a practice there to bathe in a cave. When R. Eliezer took his clothes off and removed his <i>tefillin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">To bathe in one of the caves.</i> [the host] said to him, ‘Rabbi, is not the water of that cave better than that of this one?’ And although there was only a distance of four cubits between the one and the other, R. Eliezer dressed and put on his <i>tefillin</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">To walk to the other cave.</i> because he never walked four cubits without <i>tefillin</i>. In this manner did R. Eliezer make the commandment of <i>tefillin</i> a permanent practice.
Thus used R. Eliezer to say: Great is the commandment of <i>tefillin</i>, for the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke as follows to Israel, <i>But thou shalt meditate therein day and night</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Josh. 1, 8.</i> ‘Sovereign of the universe,’ said Israel to the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘is it possible for us to meditate day and night [in the Torah]?’ The Holy One, blessed be He, answered them, ‘My children, put <i>tefillin</i> on your heads and on your arms and I shall account it to you as if you meditated in the Torah day and night’; as it is stated, <i>And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of the Lord may be in thy mouth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 13, 9.</i>
Beloved are Israel [by God], for they observe all the commandments that are in the Torah. How? <i>Tefillin</i> on their hands, <i>tefillin</i> on their heads, a <i>mezuzah</i> on their doors and four <i>ẓiẓith</i> on their garments. Concerning them David, king of Israel, said, <i>Seven times a day do I praise Thee, because of Thy righteous ordinances</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">97</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 119, 164.</i><br>[The Sages] illustrated this with a parable. To what may this be compared? To a king who said to his wife, ‘Be well dressed and adorned in my presence’. ‘For what reason?’ she asked him. ‘In order that you may be acceptable to me,’ he replied. Similarly the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Israel, ‘My children, be well dressed and adorned in My presence with [your performance of] the commandments’. ‘For what reason?’ they asked Him. ‘In order,’ He replied, ‘that you may be acceptable to Me’; as it is stated, <i>Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirẓah</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">98</sup><i class="footnote">Cant. 6, 4.</i> [which means,] ‘Thou art beautiful when thou art acceptable<sup class="footnote-marker">99</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Tirẓah</i> is of the same root as <i>raẓuï</i> (acceptable).</i> to Me through [thy performance of] the commandments’.
