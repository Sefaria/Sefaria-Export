Tractate Kutim



Chapter 1

The Samaritans in some of their ways resemble the Gentiles and in some resemble Israel, but in the majority they resemble Israel.
We do not accept from them for offering [in the Temple] sacrificial birds brought by males with a flux,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 15, 14.</i> or sacrificial birds brought by females with a flux,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 29.</i> or sacrificial birds brought by women after childbirth,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XII, 6, 8.</i> or sin-offerings or trespass-offerings, but we receive from them vows and free-will-offerings.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The words ‘vows and free-will offerings’ have dropped out of the printed text and MS.K., but are added by H in agreement with Shek. I, 5 (Sonc. ed., p. 3).</i>
We do not transfer to them anything attached to the soil,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Lest they should transfer it to Gentiles to whom such ownership is forbidden. [In ‘A.Z. 20b (Sonc. ed., p. 107) this rule is stated in connection with Gentiles. As with several other rulings which follow it was subsequently applied to Samaritans.]</i> or sell to them sheep to shear, or crops to reap<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The correct reading is probably ‘unripe produce (for cattle food) to clip’.</i> or trees attached to the soil,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The words ‘to be cut down’ should certainly be inserted.</i> but we sell them animals to slaughter.
We do not sell them large cattle even if they are mutilated, or foals or calves;<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">[From the fear that the owner will not allow them to rest on the Sabbath; cf. ‘A.Z. 15a (Sonc. ed., p. 75).]</i> but we may sell them a mutilated animal which can never recover.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">[Because it will not be put to work and so the fear, previously stated, does not apply.]</i>
We do not sell them weapons of war or anything which can cause injury to the public.
We do not give to them [Israelite women] in marriage or take wives from them,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">[For the reason, cf. below II, 7, n. 13.]</i> but we lend to them and borrow from them on interest.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">[Either the text should be emended to ‘and we do not lend to them’, etc., or the clause is a later insertion at the time of the final repudiation of the Samaritans. Cf. Kirchheim <i>ad loc.</i></i>
We give them gleanings, forgotten sheaves and the corner of the field;<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. <i>Gerim</i> I, 3, n. 7.</i> they too observe [gleanings], forgotten sheaves and the corner of the field,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">And therefore no tithe need be given for them.</i> and their word can be taken in regard to gleanings, forgotten sheaves and the corner of the field in their season and in regard to the tithe of the poor in its year.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The tithe of produce was given to the poor in the third and sixth year of the seven-year cycle.</i> Their produce is reckoned as <i>ṭebel</i><sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. produce from which the heave-offering and tithe have not been separated.</i> like the produce of Gentiles, and they make the <i>‘erub</i> ineffective like Gentiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. ‘Erub. 61b (Sonc. ed., p. 433, n. 1).</i>
An Israelite woman should not act as midwife to a Samaritan woman or suckle her child;<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">[Based on Mishnah ‘A.Z. II, 2 (Sonc. ed., p. 129) where it speaks of ‘a heathen woman’ and the reason given is ‘because she would be delivering a child to idolatry’. Since the Tosiftha ‘A.Z. III permits it in the case of a Samaritan, the text here is probably a later adaptation and] originally read ‘may act as midwife … and suckle’.</i> but a Samaritan woman can act as midwife to an Israelite woman and suckle her child on her premises.
An Israelite may circumcise a Samaritan and a Samaritan can circumcise an Israelite. R. Judah said: A Samaritan may not circumcise an Israelite because he only circumcises him in the name of Mount Gerizim.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The mountain sacred to the Samaritans as the Temple Mount in Jerusalem was to the Jews. [The phrase ‘seems to mean simply, “with the intention of attaching the person to the community of Gerizim” ’ (Montgomery, <i>The Samaritans</i>, pp. 170f.).]</i>
We may stall an animal in the inn of a Samaritan, and [an Israelite] may hire a Samaritan to follow his beast. He may also entrust his cattle to a Samaritan shepherd,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">[Because a Samaritan is not suspected of perverted practices with an animal. Cf. ‘A.Z. 15b (Sonc. ed., p. 78).]</i> and he may entrust his son to a Samaritan to teach him a trade.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">[We do not fear that he will influence the boy against Judaism.]</i> We may associate with them and converse<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">The correct reading according to Kirchheim is <span dir="rtl">מסתפרין</span>, ‘may have the hair cut by them’, instead of <span dir="rtl">מספרין</span> [in agreement with Mishnah ‘A.Z. II, 3 (Sonc. ed., p. 135).</i> with them in any place, which is not so with Gentiles.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Who are suspected of murderous intent.</i>
He performs <i>ḥaliẓah</i> for his sister-in-law and gives a <i>geṭ</i> to his wife, and a Samaritan may be relied on to bring a <i>geṭ</i><sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. his word is taken that he witnessed the signing and sealing of the <i>geṭ</i>.</i> from foreign countries to Israel.
These are the things which we do not sell them: animals which died of themselves or have been improperly slaughtered, animals forbidden [to an Israelite] as food,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Lest they should sell them to Israelites as fit for consumption.</i> reptiles,<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Lest they should mix them with things sold to Israelites.</i> a shoe made from the skin of an animal which died of itself,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ḥul. 94a (Sonc. ed., p. 528, n. 4): ‘The animal may have died through the bite of a serpent and the hide of the animal may thereby have become contaminated’. Rashi <i>ad loc.</i> explains that the leather of an animal which died of itself is inferior to that of a healthy animal, and to sell shoes from this leather is false pretences.</i> oil into which a mouse has fallen,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">[The oil would thereby become unclean, and in this matter the Samaritans were scrupulous.]</i> or [the flesh of] a <i>koskos</i><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">‘A <span dir="rtl">כוס כוס</span>’ is added by MS.K. and H. It is the term for an animal which has been hurriedly slaughtered because otherwise it would soon have died naturally.</i> or of an embryo. Although Israelites eat a <i>koskos</i> and an embryo we do not sell them to the Samaritans, because such a sale would be under false pretences. And just as we do not sell these to them so we do not buy these from them, as it is stated <i>For thou art a holy people unto the Lord thy God</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 14, 21.</i>—since thou art holy, thou must not make another people holier than thyself.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">‘Since thou art holy’, etc., is omitted in V. [Kirchheim explains that the underlying principle is that which is laid down in Pes. 50b-51a (Sonc. ed., p. 247): ‘Things which are permitted, yet others treat them as forbidden, you may not permit it in their presence’. It is there expressly applied to Samaritans.]</i>
A Samaritan may be trusted if he says that he has buried [a miscarriage] or not buried it,<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf. Nid. 56b (Sonc. ed., p. 397). If the foetus was buried in a room, any person entering it would be rendered ritually unclean.]</i> and, with regard to an animal, that it has brought forth its first-born<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">[Then the subsequent birth would not come under the law of the firstling, which was a priestly due.]</i> or not brought forth. A Samaritan may be trusted with regard to the plantation of the fourth year and uncircumcised fruit<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Lev. 19, 23f.</i> and grave-signs,<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">If he says that there is no grave in a place which is not marked.</i> but not with regard to overhanging boughs, protruding stones,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Which form a ‘tent’ for communicating ritual defilement. [Cf. Nid. Sonc. ed., p. 399, n. 2.]</i> land of the peoples,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">[i.e. countries outside the Holy Land in matters which concern ritual purity.]</i> or a <i>beth peras</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf. Jast. p. 1233.]</i> because they are suspected [of carelessness] in these matters. The general principle is that in regard to matters in which they are suspected [of carelessness] they are not trusted.

Chapter 2

We do not buy meat from a Samaritan butcher except that of which he is prepared himself to eat, nor [do we buy from him] baskets of birds unless he first puts them in his mouth.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">[Ḥul. 4a (Sonc. ed., p. 10) reads: ‘[The Israelite] cuts off the head of one of the birds and gives it to the Samaritan; if he ate it, then we may eat of his slaughtering’.]</i> He must not give them to an Israelite to eat, since the Samaritans have from of old been suspected of giving Israelites carrion to eat.
The Samaritan is on the same footing as an Israelite in regard to all damages mentioned in the Torah. Whether an Israelite kills a Samaritan or a Samaritan kills an Israelite, if he did it by inadvertence he goes into exile [to a City of Refuge], if wilfully he is put to death. If the ox of an Israelite gored the ox of a Samaritan he is exempt from damages;<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. if it was not known to have a tendency to be a gorer.</i> but should the ox of a Samaritan have gored the ox of an Israelite, if the ox is <i>tam</i> he pays half the damage and if it is <i>mu‘ad</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><span dir="rtl">תם</span> (innocuous) denotes an ox which had not previously gored, <i>mu‘ad</i> (warned) one which had done so and the owner had been warned.</i> he pays the whole damage. R. Meir said: If an ox of a Samaritan gores the ox of an Israelite, whether it is <i>tam</i> or <i>mu‘ad</i> the owner pays the whole damage and pays from his best possessions.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf. B.Ḳ. 38b (Sonc. ed., p. 217).]</i>
Their cheeses are permitted. R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Those of private persons are permitted, but those of wholesalers<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">H reads ‘those of the villages’. [The reason is that these cheeses are made for sale, and the makers are not particular to enclose them in skins of ritually clean animals.]</i> are forbidden. Their cooked and preserved vegetables, into which they usually put wine or vinegar,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf. <i>Gerim</i> I, 9, n. 18.]</i> are forbidden.
Israelite priests<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">About the time of Alexander the Great, the Samaritans built a temple on Mount Gerizim and a number of priests from Jerusalem, including a High Priest, went and ministered there. They were disowned by the Judeans.</i> share with Samaritan priests in the latters’ districts because they, as it were, rescue [the produce] from their hands, but not in Israelite districts lest [Jews appear to] confirm their priesthood. If a Samaritan priest offers from what he is eating to an Israelite, should [the priest] be unclean it is permissible, but if clean it is forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">The Samaritan priest, if unclean, would not eat <i>terumah</i>, and therefore the Israelite may eat what he was eating.</i>
We do not buy [bread] from a Samaritan baker on the outgoing of Passover until after three bakings [have been made], or from private persons until three weeks have passed, or from the villages until after three bakings.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">H reads ‘makings’ which has the same meaning as ‘bakings’. [As the continuation indicates, the ruling was made because the Samaritan Passover did not always coincide exactly with the Jewish Festival. Cf. Kirchheim <i>ad loc.</i>]</i> When does this apply? When they have not prepared their unleavened bread together with Israelites or they observed Passover one day earlier; but if they baked their unleavened bread together with Israelites or observed Passover one day later, their leaven is permitted. R. Simeon forbids it because they do not know how to observe the law of unleavened bread like the Israelites.
At first they said: The wine of Gedor is forbidden on account of the wine of Kfar Paggasha.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">For Gedor there is a variant ‘Kador’ and for Paggasha (the text in V is corrupt) ‘Pansha’. Apparently Gedor was a Samaritan village and Kfar Paggasha a heathen village near by with whose inhabitants the Samaritans freely mingled. Hence the doubt about the wine.</i> Later they revised this rule and said: Wherever [Samaritans] are suspected because of their mingling with Gentiles, if [their wine is] in an open [vessel] it is forbidden,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Because some of it may have been used in heathen worship.</i> and if in a closed [vessel] it is permitted. R. Meir said: All their wine is permitted except that which is in open [vessels for sale] in the markets; but the Sages said: In an open [vessel] it is everywhere forbidden and in a closed [vessel] permitted, while [a vessel] which has been pierced and then sealed is like one which is sealed. Their jars when new are permitted but when old are forbidden.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">[Cf. ‘A.Z. 29b (Sonc. ed., p. 146); another instance of a law relating to Gentiles which was later applied to Samaritans. An old jar may have contained the wine of a heathen.]</i>
Why are Samaritans forbidden to enter the Jewish community? Because they have become mixed up with the priests of the high places. R. Ishmael said: They were originally genuine proselytes. Why, then, are they forbidden? Because of the illegitimate females<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">[Since they are a mixed people, they include females who may not have been born to Israelite mothers and in turn their offspring are non-Israelite since their status in this respect depends upon that of the mother.]</i> and because they do not perform the levirate duty to a married woman.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">But perform <i>ḥaliẓah</i> instead. Cf. I, 11.</i>
When may they be received into the Jewish community? When they have renounced Mount Gerizim and acknowledged Jerusalem and the resurrection of the dead.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">[That the Samaritans denied the doctrine of resurrection is recorded in Sanh. 90b (Sonc. ed., p. 606, n. 1).]</i> From then onwards one who robs a Samaritan is like one who robs an Israelite.
