Avot DeRabbi Natan



Chapter 1

Moses was sanctified by the cloud and received the Torah at Sinai, as it is stated, <i>And the glory of the Lord abode upon mount Sinai, and the cloud covered him six days</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 24, 16, E.V. <i>covered it</i>.</i> [It covered Moses] in order to cleanse him, and this occurred after [the proclamation of] the Ten Commandments. So expounded R. Jose the Galilean. R. Aḳiba said: The verse <i>and the cloud covered him six days</i> refers to [the mountain and not to] Moses.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">This reading is adopted by all Commentators and has MS. support. The sense of the controversy also requires this reading.</i> The continuation of the verse, <i>And the seventh day He called unto Moses out of the midst of the cloud</i>, is to single Moses out for special honour.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The two views represented in this passage originate in the meaning given to the suffix of the verb <i>covered</i> which can signify ‘him’ or ‘it’. R. Jose is of the opinion that immediately after the declaration of the Ten Commandments, which occurred on the sixth day of Sivan, Moses was enveloped by a Divine Cloud and thereby underwent a seven-day period of purification before he could ascend the mount and approach the Divine Presence for his forty days’ stay. A similar purification was prescribed in Temple times for the High Priest before entering upon the ritual of the Day of Atonement. R. ‘Aḳiba, on the other hand, holds that the Cloud covered the mountain and not Moses. Moses was not required to undergo a period of purification, because the call to him to ascend the mount came to him on the seventh day of the month counting from the day on which Israel arrived in the wilderness of Sinai (cf. Ex. 19, 1). The call to Moses from among the assembly of Israel was merely a mark of honour, to show that he stood high above the congregation. Cf. Yoma 4aff (Sonc. ed., pp. 13ff). For the background of this controversy, cf. L. Finkelstein, <i>Mabo le-Massektot Abot ve-Abot d’Rabbi Nathan</i>, English summary, p. XXIX, note 4.</i><br>R. Nathan said: Why was it that Moses remained on the mountain six whole days without the Word<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Dibbur</i>, a Rabbinic term for Divine Revelation.</i> descending upon him? It was that he might be purged of all food and drink which were in his bowels, until such time as he would become holy and be like the ministering angels.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">[For the idea of unevacuated food being a bodily defilement, cf. Semaḥot III, 10 (below, p. 338) and A. Büchler, <i>Studies in Sin and Atonement</i>, pp. 328ff.]</i> R. Mathia b. Ḥeresh said to him, ‘Master, surely the only purpose was to impress him so that he should receive the words of the Torah with awe and fear, with dread and trembling, as it is stated, <i>Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 2, 11.</i><br>It is related that R. Josiah and R. Mathia b. Ḥeresh happened to be sitting engaged in the study of the Torah, when R. Josiah departed to pursue some secular affairs. R. Mathia b. Ḥeresh said to him, ‘Master, why do you forsake the words of the living God and immerse yourself in secular affairs? And though you are my teacher and I your pupil, [I venture to say that] it is not right to forsake the words of the living God and immerse oneself in secular affairs’. It was said of them that while they were engaged together in the study of the Torah they were like foes one towards the other, but when they departed they were like lifelong friends.
By the hand of Moses was the Torah given at Sinai, as it is stated, <i>And He wrote them upon two tables of stone, and gave them unto me</i>;<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 5, 19.</i> and in another passage it is stated, <i>These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which the Lord made between Him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 26, 46.</i> The Torah which the Holy One, blessed be He, gave to Israel was given solely through Moses, as it is stated, <i>Between Him and the children of Israel</i>. Thus Moses was worthy to become the intermediary between Israel and the All-present. Moses offered the ram of consecration<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">By which Aaron and his sons were initiated into the priesthood; cf. Ex. 29.</i> and prepared the anointing oil with which he anointed Aaron and his sons during the seven days of consecration. Of that same oil were anointed all subsequent High Priests and kings.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Hor. 11b (Sonc. ed., pp. 82f).</i> Eleazar burned the heifer of purification<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">More commonly known as the Red Heifer (cf. Num. 19, 3). As Eleazar, Aaron’s son, acted in this matter on the instruction and under the direction of Moses, the whole ritual is referable to Moses, and on that account it was effective for all future generations.</i> from whose ashes all the unclean of later generations were made clean. R. Eliezer said: Great was this act<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘measure’, of anointing oil.</i> because it was effective for all future generations, since Aaron and his sons were consecrated with this anointing oil [and their priesthood continued for many generations], as it is stated, <i>And thou shalt anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto Me in the priest’s office</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 30, 30.</i>
Joshua received [the Torah] from Moses, as it is stated, <i>And thou shalt put of thy honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may hearken</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 27, 20.</i><br>The elders received it from Joshua, as it is stated, <i>And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the Lord, that He had wrought for Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Judg. 2, 7.</i><br>The Judges received it from the elders,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">So according to the MSS. and as corrected by GRA. V reads ‘from Joshua’.</i> as it is stated, <i>And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Ruth 1, 1.</i><br>The prophets received it from the Judges, as it is stated, <i>I have sent unto you all My servants the prophets, sending them daily betimes and often</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">Jer 7, 25.</i><br>Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi received it from the [earlier] prophets.<br>The men of the Great Assembly<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Or, ‘Great Synagogue’, a legislative council of one hundred and twenty men traditionally founded by Ezra and his associates. It functioned during the Persian period and later, about 500-300 <small>B.C.E.</small></i> received it from Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi. T<small>HEY SAID THREE THINGS: BE DELIBERATE IN JUDGMENT, RAISE UP MANY DISCIPLES, AND MAKE A FENCE ROUND THE TORAH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 1:1. Quotations from Aboth are printed in capitals.</i>
<small>BE DELIBERATE IN JUDGMENT</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should be cautious in judgment, because the more cautious a man is in judgment the more confirmed is he in his judgment, as it is stated, <i>These are the proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out</i><sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 25, 1.</i>—they did not merely copy them out but deliberated on them.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The Heb. for <i>copied out</i> (<i>he ‘etiḳu</i>) may also be derived from a root meaning ‘to grow old, to spend much time’; hence the suggested interpretation ‘pondered over, deliberated’. The proverbs were studied for a long time and their meaning elucidated.</i> Abba Saul said: [The meaning is] not that they deliberated on them but brought them to light.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Giving the Heb. verb <i>he’etiḳu</i> the sense of ‘moving from a place’ as in Gen. 12, 8; hence bringing out the work from its place of concealment to the light of day. The interpretation is also borne by the late Heb. verb <i>perash</i> used by Abba Saul; cf. Reifmann in <i>Keneset Hagedolah</i> I, p. 91. According to Finkelstein, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 126, <i>perash</i> here signifies ‘they put aside’ for concealment and burial.</i> At first it was held that the books of Proverbs, Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes were to be stored away<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. not regarded as canonical Scriptures.</i> since they merely contained aphorisms and were not part of the [holy] writings. Thereupon they condemned them to be stored away, [and so they remained] until the men of the Great Assembly<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">All commentators rightly emend to ‘the men of Hezekiah’.</i> came and brought them to light again. For it is stated,<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The verses which follow are typical examples of passages from the books mentioned which ostensibly deal with erotic themes and as such are unworthy of a place in the Scriptures.</i> <i>And I beheld among the thoughtless ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding…. And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart. She is riotous and rebellious, her feet abide not in her house; now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, and lieth in wait at every corner. So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face she said to him: Sacrifices of peace-offerings were due from me; this day have I paid my vows. Therefore came I forth to meet thee, to seek thy face, and I have found thee. I have decked my couch with coverlets, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt. I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us solace ourselves with loves. For my husband is not at home, he is gone a long journey; he hath taken the bag of money with him; he will come home at the full moon</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 7, 7, 10-20.</i> And it is written in the Song of Songs: <i>Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field;</i> [17<i>a</i>] <i>let us lodge in the villages. Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see whether the vine hath budded, whether the vine-blossom be opened, and the pomegranates be in flower; there will I give thee my love</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Cant. 7, 12f.</i> And it is written in Ecclesiastes: <i>Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 11, 9.</i> And it is further written in the Song of Songs: <i>I am my beloved’s and his desire is toward me</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Cant. 7, 11.</i> Thus they did not deliberate on them but brought them to light.<br>Another interpretation of <small>BE DELIBERATE IN JUDGMENT</small>: What does it mean? It teaches that a man should speak his words calmly and should not speak in anger; for he who speaks in anger will [in the end] cause his words to be forgotten. We find it so in the case of Moses our master that he forgot his words, as it is stated, <i>And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war that went to the battle: This is the statute of the law which the Lord hath commanded Moses</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 31, 21.</i> He commanded Moses but not me; He commanded Moses, my father’s brother, but not me.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Although Moses received the law from God, he had forgotten it on account of his anger, and it was left to Eleazar the priest to instruct the warriors.</i> And where do we find that Moses had spoken in anger? It states, <i>And Moses was wrath with the officers of the Lord…. And Moses said unto them: Have ye saved all the women alive?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 14f.</i> Why does the verse state <i>all the women?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">This sentence is deleted by GRA who reads instead: ‘What is meant by <i>through the counsel of Balaam</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 16)?’</i> It is because of the advice which the wicked Balaam counselled against Israel, as it is written, <i>And now, behold, I go unto my people; come, and I will announce to thee what this people shall do to thy people in the end of days</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XXIV, 14.</i> He said to Balak, ‘This people whom you hate is hungry for food and athirst for drink, since they have nothing to eat or drink except the manna alone. Go, then, erect booths for them, set out food and drink for them, and place there beautiful girls of royal station, to the end that the people may stray after Baal of Peor, and they will fall by the hand of the All-present’. Forthwith Balak proceeded to carry out all that the wicked Balaam had counselled. See, now, what calamity that wicked Balaam brought upon Israel, since through him there fell twenty and four thousand of them, as it is stated, <i>And these that died by the plague were twenty and four thousand</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XXV, 9.</i> Is there not here an argument from the greater to the less? If it happened to Moses, who was the wisest among the wise and the greatest among the great, the father of the prophets, that when he spoke in anger he forgot his words, how much more so [does this apply to us ordinary persons]! It therefore teaches that a man should speak his words calmly and not speak in anger.<br>Ben ‘Azzai said: Beware of idle chatter in your speech.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">Do not misuse the gift of speech with empty talk.</i>
<small>AND MAKE A FENCE ROUND THE TORAH</small>. Make a fence to your words as the Holy One, blessed be He, made a fence to His words; and likewise Adam the first man, the Torah, Moses, Job, the Prophets, the Writings,<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the Hagiographa, the third division of the Scriptures. The word is inserted here by GRA and is attested by the MSS.</i> and the Sages all made a fence to their words.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">The usual meaning given to the maxim ‘make a fence’ is that the Rabbis added restrictions and further severities to the Torah to avoid the infringement of the commandment. The examples cited, however, as illustrations of those who ‘made fences’, differ in character from each other and do not conform to the pattern of the traditional definition. The older and perhaps original meaning of the maxim was an injunction to the Rabbis to explain and present the reasons for their decision, thereby safeguarding it against ridicule and rejection. It is in this sense that God made a fence to His words. As a development of the original meaning of the maxim was the exhortation to the Rabbis to express the power of God in a form intelligible to human beings; this was the ‘fence’ adopted by the Prophets. The other examples of ‘fences’ are additional prohibitions in the usual sense. For a detailed discussion on this subject, cf. the essays of Finkelstein in <i>Journal of Biblical Literature</i>, vol. LVII (1938), pp. 13-50, and vol. LIX (1940), pp. 455-469.</i><br>What fence did the Holy One, blessed be He, make to His words? It is stated, <i>Even all the nations shall say; Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 29, 23.</i> This teaches that it was already revealed to Him Who spoke and the world came into being<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">[For this designation of God, cf. A. Marmorstein, <i>The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God</i>, I, p. 89.]</i> that future generations will ask: <i>Wherefore hath the Lord done thus unto this land?</i> Consequently the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, ‘Moses, write [down the answer] and place it on record for generations to come: <i>Then men shall say: Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord … and went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods that they knew not, and that He had not allotted unto them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 24f. In this passage there is a vindication of God’s actions. Lest the nations misjudge and deem them tyrannical or arbitrary, it is stated from the beginning what calamities will befall the people in the event of disobedience. Cf. the parallel passage in <i>’Aboth d’Rabbi Nathan</i>, Recension II, ed. Schechter, p. 3.</i> Hence you learn that the Holy One, blessed be He, made a fence to His words, and recorded in the Torah what people would say in the future; thus bearing witness that the Holy One, blessed be He, pays His creatures their reward in full.<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">A difficult passage with the text in an uncertain state. The translation follows the text as emended by Finkelstein, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 116, reading <i>dikthab battorah</i> for <i>dikthib bathreh</i> and ‘<i>edin</i> (i.e. <i>‘edim</i>) for <i>‘adayin</i>. The Meiri in his commentary on Aboth explains the last sentence to mean that God prescribed in His Torah only such laws as were acceptable to man and within the capacity of human activity, and did not lay upon His creatures impossible demands. In this way mankind was afforded an opportunity of drawing a full reward.</i><br>What fence did Adam, the first man, make to his words? It is stated, <i>And the Lord God commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 2, 16f.</i> Adam was unwilling to tell this to Eve exactly as the Holy One, blessed be He, had commanded him; he therefore made a fence to his words, over and above the words which the Holy One, blessed be He, had spoken to him, and this is what he said to her, <i>But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> III, 3.</i> By so doing he meant to keep both himself and Eve away from the tree, even to the extent of not touching it. At that moment the wicked serpent reasoned to himself saying, ‘Since I cannot bring about the fall of Adam, I will bring about the fall of Eve’. Thereupon he went and seated himself beside Eve and entered into much conversation with her. He said, ‘If you think it is the touching [of the tree] that the Holy One, blessed be He, has forbidden us, behold I will touch it and not die; so you, too, will not die if you touch it’. What did the wicked serpent then do? He arose, touched the tree with his hands and feet, and shook it violently so that its fruit fell to the ground. There are some, however, who say that he did not actually touch it, but that as soon as the tree saw him it cried out, ‘O wicked one, do not touch me’; as it is stated, <i>Let not the foot of pride overtake me, and let not the hand of the wicked shake me</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ps. 36, 12. E.V., <i>let not the hand of the wicked drive me away</i>.</i>
Another interpretation of the verse, <i>Let not the foot of pride overtake me</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">This was the cry of the altar when Titus entered the Temple.</i> refers it to Titus, may his bones rot! For he raised his hand in contempt and struck the altar exclaiming, ‘Lukos! Lukos!<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">A Greek word meaning ‘wolf’, here applied opprobiously to the altar. Cf. Suk. 56b (Sonc. ed., p. 276).</i> You are a king just as I am a king, come and engage in battle with me. How many oxen have been slain upon you! How many birds have been killed upon you! How much wine has been poured out upon you! How much incense has been burned upon you! It is you who are destroying the whole world’, as it is stated, <i>Ah, Ariel, Ariel</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">A poetical name for the altar.</i> <i>the city where David was encamped! Add ye year to year, let the feasts come round!</i><sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Is. 29, 1. The reference is to the countless sacrifices offered on the altars at every season because of the many sins of the people.</i><br>Furthermore the serpent said to her, ‘If you think it is the eating [of the fruit of the tree] that the Holy One, blessed be He, has forbidden us, behold I will eat of it and will not die; so you, too, will not die if you eat of it’. Eve then began to think to herself, ‘All that my master has commanded me from the beginning is false’—for Eve used to address Adam as ‘master from the beginning’. She immediately took of the fruit and ate it, and also gave some to Adam, which he ate, as it is stated, <i>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes</i>, etc.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 3, 6.</i>
With ten curses was Eve cursed at that time, as it is stated, <i>Unto the woman He said: I will multiply and multiply thy pain and thy travail; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 16, so lit. E.V., <i>I will greatly multiply</i>.</i> <i>I will multiply and multiply</i>—these are the two discharges of blood [which cause pain to women], the menstrual and [at the termination of] virginity. [<i>Thy pain</i>—this is the anxiety connected with the rearing of children.]<sup class="footnote-marker">53</sup><i class="footnote">Inserted by GRA in accordance with ‘Erub. 100b (Sonc. ed., p. 697).</i> <i>And thy travail</i>—this is the pain associated with conception. <i>In pain thou shalt bring forth children</i>—this is to be understood in its literal meaning. <i>And thy desire shall be to thy husband</i>—this teaches that a woman particularly yearns for her husband when he is about to set out on a journey. <i>And he shall rule over thee</i>—for the man solicits by word of mouth whereas the woman solicits in her heart. [Furthermore, during her periods] she is wrapped up like a mourner, shut up as in a prison and banished from the company of all men. Now what brought about the act of touching? The answer is the fence which Adam had made to his words.<sup class="footnote-marker">54</sup><i class="footnote">Adam’s fault was that he had attached as great importance to the ‘fence’ as to the original command.</i> Hence [the Sages] said: When a man makes a fence to his words, he is not always able to stand by his words. They further said: Hence let not a man add to the words which he has heard. R. Jose said: A firm [wall] of ten hand-breadths is better than a tottering [wall] of a hundred cubits.<br>What was in the mind of the wicked serpent at that time? ‘I will go,’ he thought, ‘slay Adam and marry his wife; then I will be king over the whole world. I shall also walk erect and eat all the dainties of the world.’ Whereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘You reckoned [17<i>b</i>] to slay Adam and marry Eve; therefore <i>I will put enmity between thee and the woman</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">55</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 15.</i> You reckoned to be king over the whole world; therefore <i>Cursed art thou from among all cattle</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">56</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 14.</i> You reckoned to walk erect; therefore <i>Upon thy belly shalt thou go</i>. You reckoned to eat all the dainties of the world; therefore <i>Dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life</i>.<br>R. Simeon b. Menasia said: Alas for the most useful servant that was lost to the world! For had not the serpent been cursed, every Israelite would have been provided with two serpents for his personal use at home; one he would send to the west and the other to the east, to bring him thence gems, precious stones, pearls and every desirable thing in the world, and no creature could ever injure them.<sup class="footnote-marker">57</sup><i class="footnote">Or, according to another reading: ‘could ever hold them back’.</i> Moreover, they could have been employed in the place of camels, asses and mules to provide manure for gardens and orchards.
R. Judah b. Bathyra said: Adam, the first man, was reclining in the Garden of Eden with ministering angels at his service, roasting meat and cooling wine for him. Then the serpent came and, seeing him in all his glory, at once grew envious of him.<sup class="footnote-marker">58</sup><i class="footnote">The two paragraphs are quoted from Sanh. 59b (Sonc. ed., p. 405), but the second is there given in the name of R. Judah b. Tema.</i><br>How was Adam, the first man, created? In the first hour his dust was gathered together, in the second his outline was shaped, in the third he was made into solid substance, in the fourth his limbs were articulated, in the fifth his orifices were opened, in the sixth a soul was infused into him, in the seventh he stood on his feet, in the eighth Eve became his mate, in the ninth he was brought into the Garden of Eden, in the tenth he received his command [concerning the tree], in the eleventh he sinned, and in the twelfth he was driven out, thus fulfilling what is stated, <i>Man tarrieth not overnight in his glory</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">59</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 49, 13, indicating that Adam forfeited his glory within a day before the oncoming of night.

She thereupon went and transgressed them all.<br>R. Simeon b. Yoḥai said: I, too, will explain this to you by a parable. To what might Adam be compared? To a man who had his wife at home with him. Now what did that man do? He went and brought a cask into which he put an exact number of figs and nuts. He also caught a scorpion, placed it in the mouth of the cask, covered the cask with a tight-fitting lid and put it away in a corner. He then said to his wife, ‘My dear, all that I possess in this house is at your disposal except this cask which you may not touch under any circumstances’. What did this woman do? No sooner had her husband gone off to market than she arose, opened the cask, put her hand in it and was bitten by the scorpion. Immediately she went and flung herself on her bed. When her husband returned from market he asked her what had happened, and she replied, ‘I put my hand in the cask and was bitten by a scorpion, and now I am dying’. He said to her, ‘Did I not tell you in the beginning that everything I had in the house was at your disposal except that cask which you were not to touch under any circumstances?’ He at once became furious with her and drove her out. So it was with Adam, the first man, when the Holy One, blessed be He, charged him, <i>Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">74</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 2, 16f.</i> No sooner had Adam eaten of it than he was driven out [of Eden], to fulfil that which is stated, <i>Man tarrieth not overnight in his glory; he is like the beasts that perish</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">75</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 49, 13.

Chapter 2

What fence did the Torah make to her words? It is stated, <i>And thou shalt not approach unto a woman … as long as she is impure by her uncleanness</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 18, 19.</i> It might be supposed that he may embrace or kiss her, or engage with her in frivolous talk; the text therefore declares, <i>Thou shalt not approach</i>. It might be further supposed that he may sleep with her if she is clothed in the one bed; the text therefore declares, <i>Thou shalt not approach</i>. Again it might be supposed that she may wash her face and paint her eyes; the text therefore declares, <i>And of her that is sick with her impurity</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XV, 33.</i>—all the days of her impurity she shall be in banishment [from society].<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Heb. <span dir="rtl">נדה</span>, ‘a woman in her impurity’, is here connected with its original meaning of ‘cast out, banished from society’.</i> Hence [the Sages] said: Every woman who makes herself unattractive during the period of her impurity wins the approbation of the Rabbis, and she who adorns herself during the period of her impurity incurs their censure.
The story is told<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Quoted from Shab. 13a, b (Sonc. ed., p. 53) with some variants.</i> of a certain man who had read much Scripture, studied much Mishnah, and had attended on many scholars, yet had died in the midst of his days. His wife used to take his <i>tefillin</i>, carry them round the Synagogues and Houses of Study, and weepingly complain, ‘Masters, is it not written in your Torah, <i>That is thy life, and the length of thy days?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 30, 20.</i> Why, then, did my husband die in the midst of his days, he who read much Scripture, studied much Mishnah, and attended on many scholars?’ There was no one who could answer her. One day, Elijah, of blessed memory, met her and said to her, ‘My daughter, why do you weep and complain?’ She replied, ‘My husband had read much Scripture, studied much Mishnah and attended on many scholars; yet he died in the midst of his days’. He asked her, ‘During the first three days of your impurity what was his relationship towards you?’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The number ‘three’ found in V is difficult to explain, as the woman’s impurity continues, according to Biblical law, for a minimum period of seven days. Consequently there is no ground for drawing a distinction between the first three and the subsequent days. Most scholars, following GRA, substitute ‘seven’ for ‘three’, and the reference is to the monthly period of uncleanness. The ‘latter days of impurity’ would be, what is known in Talmudic phraseology, ‘the days of white garments’, i.e. the seven days of observation after the. cessation of the discharge. During this period a woman is forbidden by Rabbinic law all intimacy with her husband, including acts of endearment.</i> She said to him ‘Master, God forbid! He did not touch me even with his little finger, but used to say to me, “Touch no vessel lest you bring me into a state of doubt” ’. ‘And what was his relationship towards you during the latter days of your impurity?’<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">In Shab. 13a the text reads: ‘during the days of your white garments’.

Whereupon Elijah said to her, ‘Blessed be the All-present for slaying him, since it is written in the Torah, <i>And thou shalt not approach unto a woman … as long as she is impure by her uncleanness</i>.’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 18, 19.</i><br>It is stated, <i>None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 6.</i> hence [the Sages] said: Let no man remain alone with a woman at an inn, even though she be his sister or daughter, on account of public opinion. Let no man converse with a woman in the market-place, not even with his wife and needless to say with another woman, on account of public gossip. Let no man walk behind a woman in the market-place, not even behind his wife and needless to say behind another woman, on account of public gossip.<br>It is stated here,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">In the Biblical passage concerning unlawful unions.</i> <i>None of you shall approach</i>, and it is stated there, <i>Thou shalt not approach;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 19.

Ḥul. 44b (Sonc. ed., p. 239).</i> Accordingly the Sages said: Keep aloof from a trivial sin lest it lead you on to a grave sin. Run to perform a minor precept for it will lead you on to an important precept.<br>It is stated, <i>Thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Cant. 7, 3.</i> <i>Thy belly is like a heap of wheat</i>—this describes the congregation of Israel;<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

Cf. Sanh. <i>loc. cit.</i></i> which are as tender as a hedge of lilies and through their observance by Israel lead them to life in the world to come. How is this so? A man’s wife is at home with him during the period of her impurity. He could have intimacy with her or not at his will, since no man sees him and no man knows of it to rebuke him. Hence he fears only Him Who ordained the law of [the uncleanness of women.

What fence did Moses make to his words? It is stated, <i>And the Lord said unto Moses: Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 19, 10.</i> Now the righteous Moses was not willing to tell it to Israel in the manner in which the Holy One, blessed be He, spoke to him, but said to them, <i>Be ready against the third day; come not near a woman</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 15.</i> Thus Moses added a third day for them of his own accord, because Moses reasoned as follows, ‘If a man will cohabit with his wife and on the third day the seed will issue from her they will become unclean,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">In accordance with the law that if a woman discharged semen at any time within three days of coitus she is unclean, since the semen is still potent; after three days she is clean.

Shab. 87a (Sonc. ed., p. 411), Yeb. 62a (Sonc. ed., p. 412).</i> He broke the tablets, and this act of his accorded with the will of the All-present; he kept away from the Tent of Meeting, and this act of his accorded with the will of the All-present; he separated from his wife, and this act of his accorded with the will of the All-present.<br>[‘He separated from his wife, and this act of his accorded with the will of the All-present.’] How was this? He reasoned as follows: If with regard to the Israelites, who were sanctified for a short period only and summoned for the sole purpose of receiving the Ten Commandments at Mount Sinai, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to me, <i>Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 19, 10.</i> I, who am in readiness for the purpose [of receiving] the word of God daily and hourly, since I know not when He will speak with me, whether by day or by night, must all the more separate myself from a woman!

This was a permission to resume marital relations.</i> and after that it is written, <i>But as for thee, stand thou here by Me</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 28.</i> Moses then turned about<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">A strange expression in this context.

What fence did Job make to his words?

In view of the description <i>that feareth God</i>, etc., what precedes it seems superfluous.</i> And what is the significance of the words <i>a whole-hearted and an upright man?</i> They teach that Job was born circumcised.<sup class="footnote-marker">67</sup><i class="footnote">The Heb. <i>tam</i>, translated ‘whole-hearted’, is interpreted in the sense of physically perfect, the lack of circumcision being regarded as an imperfection.</i><br>Adam, the first man, also came into the world circumcised, for it is stated, <i>And God created man in His own image</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">68</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 1, 27. ‘In God’s image’ implies perfection.</i> Seth also was born circumcised, for it is stated, <i>And begot a son in his own likeness, after his image</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">69</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> V, 3, physically perfect like his father.</i> Noah also was born circumcised, for it is stated, <i>In his generations a man righteous and whole-hearted</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">70</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> VI, 9.</i> Shem also was born circumcised, for it is stated, <i>And Melchizedek king of Salem</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">71</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XIV, 18.

The word <i>michtam</i> is interpreted in Soṭ. 10b (Sonc. ed., p. 49) as <i>makkatho tammah</i>, ‘his wound was whole’, i.e. the place where there should have been a wound after the operation of circumcision was sound, since he was born circumcised.</i> Jeremiah also was born circumcised, for it is stated, <i>Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee, and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">79</sup><i class="footnote">Jer. 1, 5. Since he was consecrated even before birth he must have been formed perfect in body, i.e. already circumcised.</i> Zerubbabel also was born circumcised, for it is stated, <i>In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, will I take thee, O Ẓerubbabel, My servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the Lord, and I will make of thee as a signet</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">80</sup><i class="footnote">Hag. 2, 23.

Is there not here an argument from the less to the greater? If in the case of an unmarried girl whom, if he so wish, he may marry or may give as a wife either to his son or his brother or some other relative of his, Job was most strict with himself and would not glance at her, how much more strict was he in the case of a married woman! Why was Job so strict with himself and would not even glance at a maid? Because he reasoned, ‘Perhaps I look at her to-day, and to-morrow a man comes and takes her to wife; the consequence might be that I should be thinking of a married woman’.
What fence did the Prophets make to their words?

Is there not here an argument from the less to the greater? If of the angel Gabriel, who is but one of the countless thousands and myriads who stand before Him, it is said that his voice reaches from one end of the world to the other, how much mightier is the voice of the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, Who created the entire universe and created the celestial and terrestrial beings! But the eye of man is shown only that which it can perceive, and the ear of man is made to hear only that which it can comprehend.<sup class="footnote-marker">85</sup><i class="footnote">In the three examples quoted from the Prophets it is obvious that the expressions used are inadequate to describe the glory and might of God; the Prophets, however, deliberately employed them so that thereby they conveyed to the people an idea of God’s majesty, using terms which could be comprehended by the limited understanding of man. This choice of expressions and similes is the ‘fence’ which the Prophets made to their words.</i>
What fence did [the authors of] the Holy Writings make to their words? It states, <i>Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">86</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 5, 8.</i> <i>Remove thy way far from her</i> refers to heresy; for a man is warned, ‘Go not among heretics, nor come in to them, lest you stumble through them’. Should he, however, say, ‘I am sure of myself, and even though I go among them I will not stumble through them’; or should he say, ‘I will hear their words and then come away’? Scripture therefore states, <i>None that go unto her return, neither do they attain unto the paths of life</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">87</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> II, 19.</i> It is also written, <i>She hath prepared her meat, she hath mingled her wine; she hath furnished her table</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">88</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> IX, 2.</i> This verse describes the wicked [heretics].<sup class="footnote-marker">89</sup><i class="footnote">The word ‘heretics’ is omitted in the text, due, no doubt, to fear of the censor. It is added here by GRA.</i> When a man comes among them they give him to eat and drink, they clothe and cover him, and give him much money. But no sooner does he become one of them, than each recognizes what was his property and takes it back. Concerning these it is stated, <i>Till an arrow strike through his liver; as a bird hasteneth to the snare—and knoweth not that it is at the cost of his life</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">90</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> VII, 23.</i><br>Another interpretation of <i>Remove thy way far from her</i> refers to the harlot; for a man is warned, ‘Go not in this square, enter not in this side-way, for a harlot is there, attractive and bedecked’. Should he, however, say, ‘I am sure of myself, and even if I go there I will not stumble through her’, he is again warned, ‘Go not there even if you are sure of yourself, lest you stumble through her’. For the Sages have said: A man should not make it his habit to pass the door of a harlot, as it is stated, <i>For she hath cast down many wounded; yea, a mighty host are all her slain</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">91</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 26.</i>
What fence did the Sages make to their words? They ruled that the evening <i>Shema‘</i> may be recited only until midnight, although Rabban Gamaliel said: Until cockcrow.<sup class="footnote-marker">92</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. the opening paragraph of Mishnah Berakoth. The Sages were also of the opinion that by strict law the <i>Shema‘</i> may be recited at any time until the morning, but as a precautionary measure they ruled only until midnight. This is an example of a ‘fence’ by the Sages.</i> How is this? When a man comes home from his work, let him not say, ‘I will eat a little, drink a little, sleep a little, and then I will recite the <i>Shema‘’;</i> it may result in his sleeping through the whole night and he will have missed reciting it. He should rather act thus: when he comes home from his work in the evening let him go to the Synagogue or the House of Study. If he is in the habit of reading Scripture, let him read it; if he is in the habit of studying the Mishnah, let him study it; otherwise, let him recite the <i>Shema‘</i> and say the <i>Tefillah;</i> and whosoever transgresses the words of the Sages is deserving of death.<sup class="footnote-marker">93</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ber. 4b (Sonc. ed., p. 13).</i><br>Rabban Gamaliel said: There are times when a man recites the <i>Shema‘</i> twice in one night, once before the rise of dawn and once after the rise of dawn, and he thereby fulfils his obligation both for the day and for the night.<sup class="footnote-marker">94</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ber. 8b (Sonc. ed., p. 44).</i><br>The Sages rose up and often made fences to their words.<sup class="footnote-marker">95</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

<small>AND RAISE UP MANY DISCIPLES</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">96</sup><i class="footnote">Added by all commentators as the heading of the paragraph.</i> The School of Shammai said: A master should teach only those who are wise, meek, of good family and wealthy; whereas the School of Hillel said: He should teach everyone, for many sinners in Israel have in this way been brought near to the study of the Torah, and from them issued righteous, pious and worthy men.

Chapter 3

R. ‘Aḳiba said: He who takes a <i>peruṭah</i> from charity when not in need of it will not depart from this world before he falls in need of his fellow-men.

He also said: He who tears his clothes in his anger or breaks his vessels in his rage, will in the end worship idols; for such is the device of the evil inclination: to-day it bids man, ‘Tear your clothes’ and to-morrow it bids him, ‘Worship idols’.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

R. Ishmael b. R. Jose said: Study Torah in your old age.

It is told of a certain pious man who was in the habit of dispensing charity that he was once travelling in a ship when a storm arose and the ship was sunk in the sea. R. ‘Aḳiba who witnessed [the tragedy] came before the Beth Din to testify on behalf of the wife to enable her to remarry. Before the time came for him to testify, that pious man entered and stood before him.

He answered, ‘The charity which I dispensed brought me up from the sea’. ‘How do you know it?’ asked R. ‘Aḳiba. He replied, ‘When I went down to the nethermost depths, I heard a mighty roaring of the waves calling one to the other, “Hurry and let us bring up this man from the sea because he dispensed charity all his days” ’. At this R. ‘Aḳiba began [to praise] saying, ‘Blessed be God, the God of Israel, Who has chosen the words of the Torah and the sayings of the wise; for the words of the Torah and the sayings of the wise endure for ever and to all eternity, as it is stated, <i>Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after many days</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 11, 1.</i> It is also written, <i>Charity delivereth from death</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 10, 2, E.V., <i>righteousness delivereth</i>.</i>
It is told<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. B.B. 11a (Sonc. ed., p. 52).</i> of Benjamin the Just, who was the overseer of the charity fund, that one day a woman came to him and said, ‘Master, assist me’. He replied, ‘By the Temple Service, there is nothing left in the charity fund’. She said, ‘Master, if you do not assist me, I perish with my four<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">In B.B. <i>loc. cit.</i> ‘seven’, and so corrected here by GRA.</i> children’. He thereupon assisted her from his own purse. After a time Benjamin the Just fell ill and lay in pain on his bed. The ministering angels addressed the Holy One, blessed be He, saying, ‘Sovereign of the universe, Thou hast said that whoever saves a single soul in Israel is deemed as though he had saved alive the whole world.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sanh. 37a (Sonc. ed., p. 234).</i> How much greater must be the merit of Benjamin the Just who saved alive a widow and her four children! He is now on his bed suffering much pain in his sickness’. Thus they sought mercy on his behalf and the decree against him was annulled, twenty-two years being added to his life.

Chapter 4

<small>SIMON THE</small> J<small>UST WAS ONE OF THE LAST SURVIVORS OF THE GREAT ASSEMBLY. HE USED TO SAY: UPON THREE THINGS THE WORLD IS BASED: UPON THE TORAH, UPON THE TEMPLE SERVICE, AND UPON THE PRACTICE OF LOVINGKINDNESS</small>.<br><small>UPON THE TORAH</small>—how is this? It states, <i>For I desire mercy, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than burnt-offerings</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Hos. 6, 6.</i> Hence one may infer that of all sacrifices the burnt-offering is the most acceptable since it is entirely consumed by fire, as it is stated, <i>And the priest shall make the whole smoke on the altar, for a burnt-offering</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 1, 9.</i> In another passage it states, <i>And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt-offering unto the Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">1 Sam. 7, 9. Samuel’s prayer was immediately answered by God on account of the acceptability of the burnt-offering.</i> Nevertheless, the study of Torah is even more acceptable to the All-present than burnt-offerings, since if a man studies Torah he knows the will of the All-present, as it is stated, <i>Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find out the will of God</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 2, 5. E.V., <i>find the knowledge of God</i>.</i> Hence it follows that when a scholar sits and expounds the Torah in an assembly, Scripture accounts it to him as though he had offered the fat and the blood [of a sacrifice] upon the altar.<br>Should<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">This and the subsequent passages are inserted here to teach that though the study of the Torah is the highest good, even that may be interrupted for a wedding ceremony or a funeral procession in the circumstances stated here.</i> two scholars be sitting engaged in the study of the Torah, and a bridal procession or a cortège passes by them, if there are sufficient people present to attend to the needs of the occasion,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">As to what is considered sufficient, cf. Keth. 17a (Sonc. ed., p. 95).</i> let them not interrupt their studies; otherwise it is their duty to rise and cheer<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">A rare word from the root <i>shanan</i>, ‘to repeat a thing’, and hence ‘ to ac claim’ or ‘applaud repeatedly’. Cf. Jastrow s.v. and the next note but one.</i> and applaud the bride or accompany the dead to the grave.
It once happened that R. Judah b. Ilai was sitting and lecturing to his disciples when a bride passed before him. At once he took in his hand what was usual for the occasion,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. myrtle branches. The text is uncertain, and GRA reads: ‘as there were not sufficient people for her needs’.</i> and cheered<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">In the parallel passage in <i>Midrash Haggadol</i>, ed. Schechter, p. 82, the word is not <i>meshannen</i> (var. <i>meshannenen</i>) but <i>mesha’anen</i> from a root <i>sha‘an</i> ‘to shake, wave about’. The text there reads: ‘He took in his hand a myrtle branch and waved it until the bride had passed’.</i> the bride until she had passed by.
On another occasion while R. Judah b. Ilai was sitting and lecturing to his disciples, a bride passed before him. ‘What was that?’ he asked, and they replied, ‘A bridal party’. He said to them, ‘My sons, arise and attend to the bride, for so we find that the Holy One, blessed be He, attended to a bride, as it is stated, <i>And the Lord God built up the rib</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 2, 22; so the text lit.</i> And if He attended to a bride, how much more should we do so!’ Where do we find that the Holy One, blessed be He, attended to a bride? For it is stated, <i>And the Lord God built up the rib;</i> and in coastal towns a bride is referred to as <i>ben’itha</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. ‘with hair plaited’. The Talmud, Ber. 61a (Sonc. ed., p. 382), Shab. 95a (Sonc. ed., p. 454), connects the Heb. root for ‘build’ (<i>banah</i>) with <i>binyatha</i>, a word used in the coastal towns for ‘plaits’, and explains that God plaited Eve’s hair.</i> Hence we learn that the Holy One, blessed be He, equipped Eve, adorned her as a bride and conducted her to Adam, as it is stated, <i>And He brought her unto Adam</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. <i>ibid.</i></i><br>On one occasion only did the Holy One, blessed be He, act as a groomsman to man; thereafter a man provides his own groomsman, as it is stated, <i>Bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 23.</i> On one occasion only was the wife formed out of the man;<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘was Eve taken from Adam’.</i> thereafter a man takes the daughter of his fellow to wife.
<small>UPON THE TEMPLE SERVICE</small>—how is this? As long as the Temple Service continued, the world was a source of blessing to its inhabitants and the rains fell [20<i>a</i>] in their seasons, as it is stated, <i>To love the Lord your God, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul, that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain…. And I will give grass in thy fields for thy cattle</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 11, 13-15.</i> But when the Temple Service ceased, the world was no longer a source of blessing to its inhabitants and the rains did not fall in their season, as it is stated, <i>Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived … and He shut up the heaven, so that there shall be no rain</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 16f.</i> And it also declares in the Book of Haggai, <i>I pray you, consider from this day and forward—before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the Lord, through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when one came to the winevat to draw out fifty measures, there were but twenty</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Hag. 2, 15f.</i> Why does not the verse also state in regard to the winevat ‘to draw out twenty measures, there were but ten’ as it does in regard to the wheat? Because the winevat is a significant omen, more so than wheat, thus teaching you that whenever the yield of wine is affected it is a bad omen for the whole year. [At that time] Israel said to the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘Sovereign of the universe! Why hast Thou done this to us?’ And the Divine Spirit replied, ‘<i>Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little … Because of My house that lieth waste, while ye run every man for his own house</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> I, 9.</i> But if you will devote yourselves to the service of the Temple, I will bless you as formerly, as it is stated, <i>Consider, I pray you … from the four-and-twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the Lord’s temple was laid … Is the seed yet in the barn? Yea, the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree hath not brought forth—from this day will I bless you</i>’.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> II, 18f.</i> Hence you learn that no service is more precious to the Holy One, blessed be He, than the Temple Service.
<small>UPON THE PRACTICE OF LOVINGKINDNESS</small>—how is this? Scripture states, <i>I desire lovingkindness and not sacrifice</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Hos. 6, 6. E.V., <i>I desire mercy</i>.</i> In the beginning the world was created by lovingkindness alone, as it is stated, <i>For I have said: The world is built by lovingkindness; Thou dost establish the heavens with Thy faithfulness</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 89, 3. E.V., <i>For ever is mercy built; in the very heavens Thou dost establish Thy faithfulness</i>.</i><br>It happened once that Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai was coming out of Jerusalem, followed by R. Joshua, and he beheld the Temple in ruins. ‘Woe to us,’ cried R. Joshua, ‘for this house that lies in ruins, the place where atonement was made for the sins of Israel!’ Rabban Joḥanan said to him, ‘My son, be not grieved, for we have another means of atonement which is as effective, and that is, the practice of lovingkindness, as it is stated, <i>For I desire lovingkindness and not sacrifice</i>’. And so we find it with Daniel, the man greatly beloved, who devoted himself to acts of lovingkindness. What were the acts of lovingkindness to which Daniel devoted himself? If you say that he offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings in Babylon, had it not been previously ordained, <i>Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt-offerings in every place that thou seest; but in the place which the Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt-offerings</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 12, 13f.</i> What, then, were the acts of lovingkindness to which he devoted himself? He provided for the bride and made her to rejoice, he attended the dead to the grave, he gave alms to the poor, and prayed three times daily, and his prayer was accepted with favour, as it is stated, <i>And when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house—now his windows were open in his upper chamber toward Jerusalem—and he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Dan. 6, 11.</i><br>When<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">This passage is quoted here to indicate the active steps taken by Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai to preserve Judaism although the Temple was destroyed.</i> Vespasian came to destroy Jerusalem, he proclaimed [to its inhabitants], ‘Fools, why do you seek to destroy this city and burn the Temple? What do I demand of you? Merely that you deliver to me one bow or one arrow<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">A token of submission.</i> and then I will depart from you’. They answered him, ‘As we went forth against your two predecessors<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">The allusion is uncertain. The version given here differs in many respects from other passages in Rabbinic literature relating to Vespasian; cf. Giṭ. 56b (Sonc. ed., p. 258). [S. Zeitlin, <i>Megillat Taanit</i>, p. 104, writes: “The two former generals were undoubtedly Florus and Cestius”, whose armies were defeated in 66 <small>C.E.</small>, but the generals were not killed by the Jews.]</i> and slew them, so we will go out against you and slay you’. When Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai heard this, he sent for the men of Jerusalem and said to them, ‘My sons, why would you destroy this city and burn the Temple? What does he demand of you? Merely one bow or one arrow, and then he will depart from you’. They answered him, ‘As we went forth against his two predecessors and slew them, so we will go out against him and slay him’.<br>Now Vespasian had some men of his resident [within and] close to the walls of Jerusalem, and whatever they heard they wrote upon an arrow which they shot beyond the wall. [In this manner] they reported that Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai was among Caesar’s friends. So Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai appealed to the men of Jerusalem. After he had pleaded with them for several days<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘one day and two and three days’.</i> and they would not agree with him, he sent for his disciples, R. Eliezer and R. Joshua, and said to them, ‘My sons, arise and carry me forth from here. Make a coffin for me and I will lie in it’. [They did so, and] R. Eliezer took hold of it at the head and R. Joshua at the foot, and they carried him until sunset when they arrived at the gates of Jerusalem. The gatekeepers asked, ‘What is this?’ They replied, ‘A dead man; do you not know that a corpse may not be kept overnight in Jerusalem?’<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. below XXXV, 2, p. 171.</i> They said, ‘If it is a corpse, carry it out’. They carried it out (and bore it until sunset)<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">The words in brackets are clearly to be deleted.</i> when they arrived before Vespasian, opened the coffin and [Rabban Joḥanan] stood before him. He asked, ‘You are Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai? Ask what I shall give you’. He replied, ‘I ask for nothing but Jabneh whither I may go and teach my disciples, where I can institute prayers,<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Or, ‘the house of prayer’. A variant gives the curious reading: ‘the precept of <i>tefillin</i> (phylacteries)’.</i> and observe all the commandments prescribed in the Torah’. He said to him, ‘Go and do all that you wish to perform’. Rabban Joḥanan then said, ‘May I be permitted to say a word to you?’ ‘Speak,’ he said. Rabban Joḥanan then said, ‘You are about to become Emperor’. ‘How do you know this?’ he asked, and Rabban Joḥanan replied, ‘There is a tradition with us that the Temple will not be delivered into the hand of a common soldier but to a king, as it is stated, <i>And He shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one</i>’.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">Is. 10, 34. Cf. Giḳ., <i>loc. cit.</i>, where <i>Lebanon</i> is identified with the Temple and <i>mighty one</i> is applied to a king. [In Jewish War III, viii, 9 Josephus relates that he made the same prediction to Vespasian.]</i> It is related that a few days had not elapsed before there came to him a despatch<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Or, ‘two deputies’; so Rashi in Ta‘an. 18b. [This interpretation is accepted by Krauss, <i>Lehnwörter</i>, p. 201.]</i> from his city [Rome], informing him that Caesar had died, and he had been elected Emperor. They brought to him a battering-ram which he directed<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>wesamah</i> as suggested by GRA. The word in V, <i>wetifa’</i>, is apparently an abbreviation which has so far defied satisfactory explanation.</i> towards the wall of Jerusalem. Then they brought to him logs of cedar which he inserted in the battering-ram and hurled at the wall until he breached it. They then brought to him a pig’s head which he inserted in the battering-ram and shot it on to the sacrificial limbs that were upon the altar. At that moment Jerusalem was captured. Rabban Joḥanan was sitting and anxiously waiting for news, as Eli had sat and waited for news, as it is stated, <i>Lo, Eli sat upon his seat by the wayside, watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">1 Sam. 4, 13.</i> As soon as Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai heard that Jerusalem was destroyed and the Temple in flames, he rent his clothes, his disciples also rent their clothes, and they wept and cried out and lamented.<br>Scripture states,<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Some attach the verse which is cited to the preceding paragraph, thus: ‘and lamented saying, <i>Open thy doors</i>’ etc.</i> <i>Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Zech, 11, 1.</i> This alludes to the chief priests who were in the Temple, took their keys in their hands and hurled them upwards, exclaiming before the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘Lord of the universe! here are Thy keys which Thou didst entrust to us, seeing that we have not been faithful treasurers to discharge the duties imposed by the King, and we are no longer worthy to eat from the King’s table’.<br>The patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and the twelve tribes also wept and cried out and lamented, saying, <i>Wail, O cypress-tree, for the cedar is fallen, because the glorious ones are spoiled;</i> [<i>wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong forest is come down</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 2.</i> <i>Wail, O cypress-tree, for the cedar is fallen</i> refers to the Temple; <i>because the glorious ones are spoiled</i> refers to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and the twelve tribes; <i>wail, O ye oaks of Bashan</i> refers to Moses, Aaron and Miriam; <i>for the strong forest is come down</i> refers to the Holy of Holies. <i>Hark! the wailing of the shepherds, for their glory is spoiled</i><sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 3.</i> refers to David and his son Solomon. <i>Hark! the roaring of young lions, for the thickets of the Jordan are spoiled</i> refers to Elijah and Elisha.
In three things did the Holy One, blessed be He, make human beings to differ one from the other: in voice, in temperament<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘pleasantness’.</i> and in features.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">In the parallel passage in Sanh. 38a (Sonc. ed., p. 240) the text reads: ‘in voice, in appearance, and in mind’.</i> Why in voice? The Holy One, blessed be He, made the voices of men different one from the other; for had He not done so, immorality would have increased in the world, since as soon as a man left his home another might enter and ravish his wife in his own house. Therefore did the Holy One, blessed be He, make men differ from each other in voice, one man’s voice being different from his fellow’s. Why in temperament? The Holy One, blessed be He, made the temperament of men different one from the other; because had He not done so men would be jealous of each other. Therefore did the Holy One, blessed be He, make mankind differ from one another in temperament, one man’s temperament being different from his fellow’s. Why in appearance? The Holy One, blessed be He, made the features of human beings different one from another; because had He not done so, the daughters of Israel would not recognize their husbands nor the husbands their wives. Therefore did the Holy One, blessed be He, make them different in facial features.

A<small>NTIGONOS OF</small> S<small>OCHO RECEIVED THE TRADITION FROM</small> S<small>IMON THE</small> J<small>UST. HE USED TO SAY: BE NOT</small> [20<i>b</i>] <small>LIKE SERVANTS WHO SERVE THE MASTER FOR THE SAKE OF RECEIVING A REWARD</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Or, ‘gratuity’; so Maimonides <i>ad loc.</i></i> <small>BUT BE LIKE SERVANTS WHO SERVE THE MASTER WITHOUT THE EXPECTATION OF RECEIVING A REWARD; AND LET THE FEAR OF HEAVEN BE UPON YOU</small>, in order that your reward may be double in the world to come.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The last clause, ‘in order … to come’, is not found in the statement of Antigonos as reported in Aboth 1:3 (Sonc. ed., p. 3), and apparently did not form part of the original teaching. It actually contradicts the doctrine of disinterested service. Moreover, if these words formed part of the teaching, there would be no foundation for the arguments of the disciples stated in the following paragraph.</i>
Antigonos of Socho had two disciples<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Zadok and Boethus mentioned below.</i> who repeated this doctrine to their disciples and their disciples to their disciples. They rose up and examined the matter, saying, ‘Why did our predecessors say this? Is it right for a labourer to toil all day and not receive his reward in the evening? Had our predecessors known that there was another world and that there would be the resurrection of the dead they surely would not have taught thus!’ So they arose and turned away from the Torah.

Chapter 6

J<small>OSE B</small>. J<small>OEZER SAID: LET YOUR HOUSE BE A MEETING-HOUSE FOR THE WISE</small>. What is meant by this? It teaches that a man’s house should be available to the wise, their disciples, and the disciples of their disciples; in the same manner that a man might say to his fellow, ‘I will wait for you at such and such a place’.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">So should your house be the rendezvous of scholars.</i><br>Another interpretation of <small>LET YOUR HOUSE BE A MEETING-HOUSE FOR THE WISE</small>: this means that when a disciple comes into your presence and says to you, ‘Give me instruction’, if it is within your power to teach him, instruct him, but if not dismiss him at once.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Your house should be a place for instruction and study; if therefore you are not in a position to impart knowledge, do not detain the would-be learner, but let him seek instruction elsewhere.</i> Moreover, let him not sit before you on a couch or on a chair or on a bench, but on the ground; and every word that you utter he should accept with awe and reverence, with fear and dread.
<small>AND SIT AMIDST THE DUST OF THEIR FEET</small>. What is meant by this? When a scholar comes to a town, say not, ‘I have no need of him’; but go to him, and sit not before him on a couch or on a chair or on a bench, but sit before him on the ground; and every word that he utters accept with awe and reverence, with fear and dread, in the same manner that our forefathers received the Torah at Mount Sinai with awe and reverence, with fear and dread.<br>Another interpretation of <small>AND SIT AMIDST THE DUST OF THEIR FEET</small>—as did R. Eliezer; <small>AND DRINK IN THEIR WORDS WITH THIRST</small>—as did R. ‘Aḳiba.<br>What was the beginning of R. ‘Aḳiba? It was said of him that at the age of forty he had learnt nothing at all. On one occasion, as he was standing by the mouth of a well, he enquired, ‘Who carved out this stone?’ They answered, ‘The water which constantly falls on it, day in and day out’. They continued, ‘ ‘Aḳiba, have you not read the verse, <i>The waters wear the stones?</i>’<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Job 14, 19.</i> Forthwith R. ‘Aḳiba applied to himself the following <i>a fortiori</i> argument: If the soft [water] can wear away the hard [stone], how much more can the words of the Torah, which are hard like iron, carve a way into my heart which is of flesh and blood! Immediately he turned to the study of the Torah. Both he and his son went and sat down before the school-teacher and said to him, ‘Master, teach us the Torah’. R. ‘Aḳiba took hold of the tablet by one end and his son by the other end, and on it the teacher wrote <i>’alef beth</i><sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The first and second letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</i> which he learnt, <i>’alef taw</i><sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The first and last letters of the alphabet.</i> which he learnt, and then the Book of Leviticus which he also learnt.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">All the verbs used here are in the singular, obviously referring to ‘Aḳiba; but no further information is given of the son.</i> So he continued to study until he had learnt the whole Torah. He then went and sat before R. Eliezer and R. Joshua and said to them, ‘My masters, initiate me into the reasoning of the Mishnah’. As soon as they recited one <i>halakah</i> to him, he went away and sat down alone asking himself, ‘Why is <i>’alef</i> so written? Why is <i>beth</i> so written? Why is this stated?’ He thereupon returned to his masters and asked them, and held them up with his words.<br>R. Simeon b. Eleazar said, ‘I will illustrate this to you by a parable. To what can this be compared? To a stonemason who was quarrying stones in a mountain. One day he took his pick in his hand, went out and sat on the mountain, and chipped away small stones. When people came and asked him what he was doing, he told them, “I mean to uproot the mountain and cast it into the Jordan”. They said to him, “You cannot possibly uproot the whole mountain”. Nevertheless, he continued chipping away until it became the size of a large boulder. He inserted himself beneath it, unloosed it, uprooted it, and cast it into the Jordan, saying, “Here is not your place but there” ’.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The point of the parable is that by slow degrees, perseverance and skill, one can master even what seems impossible.</i> In this way did R. ‘Aḳiba glean the knowledge of Torah from<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘did to, act towards’.</i> R. Eliezer and R. Joshua. R. Ṭarfon said to him, ‘ ‘Aḳiba, it is of you that the verse speaks, <i>He bindeth the streams that they trickle not; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light</i>.’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Job 28, 11.</i> The things which were hidden from men R. ‘Aḳiba brought to light.<br>Every day he used to gather a bundle of wood, half of which he sold to provide food for himself, and the other half he used for his personal needs. His neighbours rose up against him and cried, ‘ ‘Aḳiba, you are ruining us with your smoke! Come, sell all [the wood] to us, and with the money you can buy oil, and study by the light of an oil lamp’. But he replied, ‘I derive many uses from [the wood]: first I study by its light, secondly I keep myself warm by it, and thirdly I am able to sleep on it’.<br>In the Hereafter [the example of] R. ‘Aḳiba will condemn all the poor; for when they will be charged, ‘Why did you not study Torah?’ and they plead, ‘Because we were too poor’, it will be retorted, ‘Was not R. ‘Aḳiba very poor and in straitened circumstances?’ And if they plead, ‘Because of our little children’, it will be retorted, ‘Did not R. ‘Aḳiba have many sons and daughters for whom he had to provide as well as his wife Rachel [and yet he studied the Torah]?’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The text of the last sentence is far from clear and the translation follows the reading suggested by GRA; cf. Schechter <i>ad loc.</i> According to Finkelstein, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 188, the original reading is: ‘many sons and daughters who were provided for by his wife Rachel’; i.e. the poor will be able to offer as defence that their wives were not like Rachel,</i><br>He was forty years old when he started to study Torah and by the end of thirteen years he taught Torah in public.

What was the beginning of R. Eliezer b. Hyrḳanos? He was twenty-two years old and had not yet studied Torah. One day he said [to his father], ‘I will go and study Torah under Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai’. His father Hyrḳanos replied, ‘You shall not taste a morsel of food until you shall have ploughed a complete furrow’. He rose early in the morning and ploughed a complete furrow. It is said that that day was the eve of the Sabbath, so that he went and dined at the house of his father-in-law. Another version is that he tasted nothing between six hours before the Sabbath and six hours after the Sabbath. As he was walking on his way he saw a stone which he thought<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">An unusual word in this context. MS. E. reads <i>herimah</i> (he lifted it up).</i> [to be food]; he took it and put it in his mouth—some say that it was cattle dung. He walked on until he came to an inn where he spent the night. He went and sat before Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai in Jerusalem. Soon an offensive smell came forth from his mouth; whereupon Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai said, ‘Eliezer, my son, have you eaten anything to-day!’ He did not answer. Again the question was put to him and he still remained silent. The innkeeper was sent for and asked, ‘Has Eliezer eaten with you?’ He replied, ‘I thought that perhaps he had eaten at your table, Master’. ‘I, too, thought that perhaps he had eaten at your table,’ said Rabban Joḥanan; ‘between us we might have lost R. Eliezer.’ He then said to Eliezer, ‘Just as an offensive smell came forth from your mouth, so shall there go forth from you a distinguished name in Torah’.<br>When his father Hyrḳanos heard that he was studying Torah under Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai, he declared, ‘I shall go [to Jerusalem] and prohibit my son Eliezer by vow [from deriving any benefit] from my estate’. It was said that on that day Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai was sitting and expounding the Torah in Jerusalem, and all the notables of Israel were sitting before him. On learning that Hyrḳanos had arrived, he posted watchmen and charged them, ‘If Hyrḳanos comes in and wishes to sit down,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Among the scholars in the back rows.</i> do not let him.’<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">He would then have to move forward to the front rows, thus coming closer to his son and witnessing his distinction.</i> When he came in and wished to sit down, they did not allow him to do so, and he was compelled to move forward<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘he was leaping and going forward’.</i> until he came to where Ben Ẓiẓith Hakkeseth, Naḳdimon b. Gorion, and Ben Kalba Sabua‘<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">These three men are named as being extremely wealthy in Giṭ. 56a (Sonc. ed., p. 256).</i> were seated, and he sat down among them trembling. It was said that on that day Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai turned his gaze upon R. Eliezer and bade him commence the discourse. He said, ‘I cannot do so’. The master as well as the disciples urged him, whereupon he began the discourse and expounded matters about which no ear had ever heard [the like]. At every utterance that came from his lips, Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai stood up and kissed him on the head; but R. Eliezer exclaimed, ‘My master, you have taught me the truth’. Before the time of adjournment had arrived, his father Hyrḳanos stood up and said, ‘My masters, I came here for the sole purpose of depriving my son Eliezer by vow of my property, but now [I declare] all my property assigned to my son Eliezer, [21<i>a</i>] and all his brothers stand dispossessed and deprived of everything’.<br>Why was Ẓiẓith Hakkeseth so named? Because he used to recline upon a silver couch at the head of all the notables of Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">On the basis of the explanation given here it has been argued that the correct form of the name is Ẓiẓith Hakkesef, i.e. ‘Ẓiẓith of the silver (couch)’. This variant has some MS. authority; cf. Finkelstein, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 135. In the Talmud (Giṭ. <i>loc. cit.</i>) he was so called because his fringes (<i>ẓiẓith</i>) used to trail on cushions (<i>keseth</i>), or his seat (<i>kisse’</i>) was among those of the Roman nobility.</i><br>It is related concerning the daughter of Naḳdimon b. Gorion that her bed had been arrayed at the cost of twelve thousand golden <i>dinars</i>, and that from one eve of the Sabbath to the next a Tyrian golden <i>dinar</i> was spent by her on sweetmeats.

Naḳdimon went to a certain nobleman and said to him, ‘Lend me twelve wells of water from now until such and such a day, and if I do not repay you twelve wells of water I will give you twelve talents of silver’. He fixed a time-limit for repayment. When the time came the nobleman sent him [the message], ‘Deliver to me either twelve wells of water or twelve talents of silver’. He replied, ‘There is still time during the day [for repayment]’. The nobleman sneeringly said to him, ‘There has been no rain the whole year, will it rain now?’ The nobleman repaired in a happy mood to the bath-house, while Naḳdimon b. Gorion entered the Temple,<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">So according to GRA and Ta‘an. <i>loc. cit.</i> V reads: ‘House of Study.’ [Büchler, <i>Studies in Jewish History</i>, pp. 99f. holds that “though many legendary features are interwoven in this story, there is no ground for doubting the actual occurrence related.”]</i> wrapped himself in his cloak and stood up to pray. He said, ‘Lord of the universe!

Immediately the sky became overcast and rain began to fall until the twelve wells were filled to overflowing. He then sent [a message] to that nobleman, ‘Deliver to me the money for the extra water which you have because of me’. He replied, ‘The sun has already set and the rain has fallen in my possession’.

Perform for me a miracle now as Thou didst perform before’. Immediately the wind blew, the clouds dispersed, and the sun shone through. When they met the nobleman said, ‘I know that it was only for your sake that the Holy One, blessed be He, disorganized His world’.<br>Why was Kalba Sabua‘ so named?

He went in and found that he had enough to supply food for every citizen in Jerusalem for a period of twenty-two years. He immediately gave orders and the produce was stacked and cleaned, ground and sifted, kneaded and baked into bread, so providing a food-supply for every citizen in Jerusalem for twenty-two years. They, however, paid no heed to him. What did the men of Jerusalem do? They took the loaves of bread,<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Reading <i>ha’iggulim</i> for <i>ha’agalim</i> with Jastrow, p. 1066b.</i> cut them through with saws and soiled them with mud.

When Vespasian examined the excrement of the besieged men and saw that it was without a trace of corn, he remarked to his soldiers, ‘If these men who subsist on straw only can slay so many of you, how many more of you would they slay if they were to eat and drink like you!’

Chapter 7

J<small>OSEPH B.</small> J<small>OḤANAN OF</small> J<small>ERUSALEM SAID: LET YOUR HOUSE BE OPENED WIDE, AND LET THE POOR BE MEMBERS OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD; AND TALK NOT MUCH WITH A WOMAN</small>.<br><small>LET YOUR HOUSE BE OPENED WIDE</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man’s house should be opened wide to the south, to the east, to the west and to the north, like Job who made four doors to his house. And why did Job make four doors to his house? So that the poor should not have the trouble of going round the entire house. He who came from the north entered straight ahead, and he who came from the south entered straight ahead, and so on all sides. For this reason Job made four doors to his house.<br><small>AND LET THE POOR BE MEMBERS OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD</small>. This does not mean literally that they should be members of your household, but that the poor should be able to talk freely about what they ate and drank in your house, just as the poor talked freely about what they had eaten and drunk in Job’s house. When the poor met, one would ask the other, ‘Whence do you come?’ and he would reply, ‘From Job’s house’. Or one would ask the other, ‘Where are you going?’ and he would reply, ‘To Job’s house’. When the great calamity befell him, he addressed the Holy One, blessed be He, saying, ‘Lord of the universe! Did I not feed the hungry and give drink to the thirsty, as it is stated, <i>If I have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Job 31, 17.</i> And did I not clothe the naked, as it is stated, <i>And warmed with the fleece of my sheep?</i>’<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 20.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, answered him, ‘For all that, Job, you have not attained to one half the standard [of hospitality] displayed by Abraham. You remained in your house waiting for guests to come to you. To him who was accustomed to eat wheaten bread you gave wheaten bread, to him who was accustomed to eat meat you gave meat, and to him who was accustomed to drink wine you gave wine. Abraham, however, did not act so. He went abroad,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘in the world’.</i> and when he met wayfarers he brought them to his home. Even to him who was unaccustomed to eat wheaten bread he gave wheaten bread, to him who was unaccustomed to eat meat he gave meat, and to him who was unaccustomed to drink wine he gave wine. Not only that; but he went and built large mansions along the roadways and placed in them a supply of food and drink, so that whoever entered ate and drank and blessed Heaven. Therefore was he granted happiness;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">And was blessed with a child in his old age. The Hebrew phrase is frequently used in connection with the Deity and the text could be rendered, ‘Therefore it afforded Him much satisfaction’.</i> and whatever the heart desired<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘the mouth asked for’.</i> was to be found in Abraham’s home, as it is stated, <i>And Abraham planted a tamarisk-tree in Beer-sheba</i>’.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 21, 33. The Heb. for <i>tamarisk-tree</i> is <i>’eshel</i>, which by transposition of letters can produce the verb <i>sha’al</i>, ‘to ask for’. [Cf. Midrash Rabbah to Genesis <i>ad loc.</i>, LIV, 6 (Sonc. ed., p. 480): ‘R. Judah said: <i>’Eshel</i> means an orchard, the word meaning ask for whatever you wish, figs, grapes or pomegranates’.] See also Rashi on Keth. 8b where the word is regarded as made of the initial letters of <i>’akilah</i> (eating), <i>shethiyah</i> (drinking) and <i>lewiyyah</i> (escorting a guest on his way), descriptive of Abraham’s hospitality.</i>
Teach the members of your household humility; for when a man is humble and the members of his household are also humble, if a poor man comes to the door and asks, ‘Is your father at home?’ they will reply, ‘Yes, come in’. Before he even enters the house the table is already laid for him, and when he comes in he eats and drinks and blesses the name of Heaven. On this account that man is granted much happiness.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Or, ‘and it affords Him much satisfaction’.</i> But when a man is not<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">So GRA. V omits ‘not’.</i> humble and the members of his household are ill-tempered, if a poor man comes to the door and asks, ‘Is your father at home?’ they will reply, ‘No’, rebuke him and drive him away with harsh words.<br>Another interpretation of ‘Teach the members of your household humility’. What does it mean? It teaches that when a man is humble and the members of his household are also humble, if he sets out to a land beyond the sea, he will say [with confidence], ‘I thank Thee, O Lord my God, that my wife is not engaged in strife with her neighbours’. His heart is not anxious, but his mind is at ease until the time of his return. But when a man is not humble and the members of his household are ill-tempered, if he sets out for a distant land, he will say [with apprehension], ‘May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, that my wife be not engaged in strife with her neighbours nor my children in conflict’. His heart is anxious and his mind ill at ease until the time of his return.<br><small>AND TALK NOT MUCH WITH A WOMAN.</small> This is so even though she be his wife, and needless to say if she be his fellow’s wife. For when a man talks much with a woman he brings evil upon himself, neglects the study of the Torah, and in the end will inherit Gehinnom.
Another interpretation of <small>AND TALK NOT MUCH WITH A WOMAN</small>. What does it mean? When a man has come into the House of Study and has not there received the respect due to him, or he has had an argument with his fellow, let him not go and report it to his wife, saying, ‘I had an argument with my neighbour; this is what he said to me and this is what I replied’. Thereby he disgraces himself, disgraces his wife and disgraces his neighbour; and his wife who previously held him in esteem [now inwardly] laughs at him. Moreover, when the neighbour hears of it, he exclaims, ‘Alas! words which concerned only me and him he has gone and gossiped to his wife’. The outcome is that this man disgraces himself, his wife and his neighbour.

Chapter 8

J<small>OSHUA B.</small> P<small>ERAḤIAH AND</small> N<small>ITTAI THE</small> A<small>RBELITE RECEIVED THE TRADITION FROM THE PRECEDING</small>. J<small>OSHUA B.</small> P<small>ERAḤIAH SAID: PROVIDE YOURSELF WITH A TEACHER, AND GET YOURSELF A COMPANION, AND JUDGE ALL MEN FAVOURABLY</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘in the scale of innocence’.</i><br><small>PROVIDE YOURSELF WITH A TEACHER</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should provide himself with a permanent teacher from whom he may learn Scripture, Mishnah, Midrash, <i>halakah</i> and <i>’aggadoth</i>. Accordingly, points which the teacher omitted to tell him in Scripture he can teach him later in the Mishnah, [what he omitted in the Mishnah he can teach him later in the Midrash,]<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">So in MS. E., omitted in V.</i> what he omitted in the Midrash he can teach him later in the <i>halakoth</i>, and finally what he omitted in the <i>halakoth</i> he can teach him in the <i>’aggadoth</i>. Consequently this man remains in his place and is replete with well-being and blessing.
R. Meir used to say: He who learns Torah from one teacher, to what can he be compared? To a man who has but one field; he sowed it partly with wheat and partly with barley, in another part he planted olive-trees and in still another fruit-trees. The consequence is that this man is [in one place and is] replete with well-being and blessing. When, however, a man learns from two or three teachers, he may be compared to a person who has many fields; in one he sowed wheat and in another barley, in a third he planted olive-trees and in yet another he planted fruit-trees. The result is that this man is always on the move<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">lit ‘dispersed’.</i> in the country and has no enjoyment of well-being and blessing.
<small>AND GET YOURSELF A COMPANION</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should get a companion for himself one who will eat with him, drink with him, read the Scriptures with him, study Mishnah with him, lodge with him, and reveal to him all secret lore, the mysteries of the Torah and the problems of everyday life. When they sit together engaged in the study of the Torah, if one of them errs in a <i>halakah</i> or in the opening passage of a chapter, or he pronounces what is unclean to be clean or what is clean to be unclean, or he declares what is forbidden to be permitted or what is permitted to be forbidden, his companion can correct him. [21<i>b</i>] Whence do we know that when his companion corrects him and continues to read with him they both receive a good reward for their labour? Because it is stated, <i>Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 4, 9.</i>
If three sit together and are engaged in the study of the Torah, the Holy One, blessed be He, accounts it to them as though they had formed a conclave<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Heb. <i>’aguddah</i>, translated ‘conclave’, is frequently applied in other contexts to a collection consisting of three units, e.g. the <i>lulab</i> which is a combination of three plants: the palm, the myrtle and the willow.</i> before Him, as it is stated, <i>It is He that buildeth His upper chambers in the heaven, and hath founded His vault upon the earth; He that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; the Lord is His name</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Amos 9, 6. The Heb. for <i>vault</i> is <i>’aguddah</i>, homiletically understood as ‘conclave’.</i> Hence you learn that if three sit together and are engaged in the study of the Torah, it is accounted to them as though they formed a conclave before the Holy One, blessed be He.
If two sit together and are engaged in the study of the Torah, their reward is set aside for them on high, as it is stated, <i>Then they that feared the Lord spoke one with another, and the Lord hearkened</i> … [<i>and a book of remembrance was written before Him, for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon His name</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Mal. 3, 16. The expression <i>one with another</i> suggests a group of two.</i> Who are <i>they that feared the Lord?</i> Those who decide upon a course, [and declare their intention,] saying, ‘We will go to free the bound and redeem the captive’. The Holy One, blessed be He, provides them with the opportunity, and they proceed to do it forthwith.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is in accordance with the verse, <i>Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee</i> (Job 22, 28); for God abets the good intentions of the righteous.</i> And who are <i>they that thought upon His name?</i> Those who merely think in their hearts [without declaring an intention], ‘We will go to free the bound and redeem the captive’. These the Holy One, blessed be He, affords no opportunity,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Since they did not expressly declare their course, it would seem that their original intention was not meant to be translated into action, but was to remain with them as a pious wish.</i> and an angel comes and strikes them to the ground.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">‘Them’ in all probability refers to the captives who come to grief before their would-be deliverers decide to act.</i>
If one man sits and occupies himself in the Torah, his reward is set aside for him on high, as it is stated, <i>Though he sit alone and meditate in stillness, yet he hath taken</i> [his reward] <i>unto himself</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Lam. 3, 28. E.V., <i>Let him sit alone and keep silence, because He hath laid it upon him</i>.</i> This may be illustrated by a parable.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">What follows is hardly a parable, but merely an example of an individual, in this case a small child, studying alone and being praised for his act.</i> To what can the matter be likened? To a man who had a young son. When the father went to market leaving his son on his own, the child arose, took a scroll, placed it on his lap, and began to study it. When the father returned from market he exclaimed, ‘See what my young son has done! When I left him and set out to market he, of his own accord, took a scroll, placed it on his lap, and began to study it!’ Hence you learn that, even if one man sits alone and occupies himself in the Torah, his reward is set aside for him on high.
<small>AND JUDGE ALL MEN FAVOURABLY</small>. It once happened that a young girl was taken captive and two pious men set out after her to ransom her. One of them entered a house of ill-fame.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Where the girl had been taken.</i> When he came out he said to his companion, ‘Of what did you suspect me?’ The other replied, ‘I thought that perhaps [you went there] to find out at what price she was held for ransom’. He said, ‘By the Temple Service! So it was; and as you judged me favourably, so may the Holy One, blessed be He, judge you favourably.’
Again it happened that a young girl was taken captive and two pious men set out after her to ransom her. One of them, however, was arrested on a [false] charge of robbery and was detained in prison, where his wife daily brought him bread and water. One day he said to her, ‘Go to my colleague and tell him that I am detained in prison [because of my efforts to save the girl] from harlotry,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The phrase is strange in its present context and is deleted by GRA.</i> while he stays at home, making merry, with no concern about the girl’. She replied, ‘Is it not enough for you that you are detained in prison that you must occupy yourself with futile matters?’ She did not go, but occupied herself with matters of no moment. He then said to her, ‘I beg of you, go and inform him’. She went and informed his colleague. Now what did that man do? He went and took with him much silver and gold as well as several men, and released the two of them. On his release he said to his companions, ‘Permit this young girl to sleep with me in bed with her clothes on’.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">His intention was to protect her from those who might take advantage of her plight.</i> [They did so.] The following morning he said to them, ‘Prepare a ritual bath for me and also for her’. They did so. He then said to those who had prepared the baths, ‘When I asked for a ritual bath for myself, of what did you suspect me?’ They replied, ‘We thought that during all the days that you were confined in prison you must have suffered hunger and thirst, and that now that you have come out into the free world your emotions were stirred and you probably suffered a pollution’. He further said to them, ‘And when I asked for a ritual bath for the young girl, of what did you suspect her?’ They replied, ‘Seeing that all those days that she had been living among heathens she was obliged to eat of their food and drink with them, now [that she is free] you asked that a ritual bath be prepared for her in order that she may become clean’. He said to them, ‘By the Temple Service! So it was; and as you judged me favourably, so may the Holy One, blessed be He, judge you favourably’.<br>Just as the righteous men of old were pious, so also were their beasts. It was said that the camels of our father Abraham would not enter a house in which there was an idol, as it is stated, <i>For I have cleared the house, and made room for the camels</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 24, 31.</i> <i>I have cleared the house</i> of the terafim; why, then, does the verse add <i>and made room for the camels?</i> It teaches that they would not enter the house of Laban the Aramean until all the idols had been cleared out before them.<br>Once the ass of R. Ḥanina b. Dosa was stolen by bandits. They locked it up in a courtyard and placed before it hay, barley and water, but it would neither eat nor drink. They said, ‘Why should we let it die here and befoul the courtyard with its stench?’ So they proceeded to open the gate for it and let it go free. It dragged itself<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Because it was enfeebled by hunger and thirst. For the verb <span dir="rtl">מושכת</span> there is a variant <span dir="rtl">משחקת</span>, ‘being merry’, but it does not make sense here. Schechter reads <span dir="rtl">מנהקת</span>, ‘braying’.</i> all the way until it reached the house of R. Ḥanina b. Dosa. When it arrived, R. Ḥanina’s son heard its cry and said to his father, ‘Father, the sound is very similar to that of our beast.’ The father said to him, ‘My son, open the door for it, since it is almost dead from hunger’. He at once opened the door for it, and put before it hay, barley and water which it ate and drank. Because of this incident the Sages declared: Just as the righteous men of old were pious, so too were their beasts.

It is all one whether the neighbour is within or without your house or in a [nearby] field; for leprosy affects only the house of the wicked, as it is stated, <i>His own iniquities shall ensnare the wicked</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 5, 22.</i> It teaches that leprosy is caused only through the iniquity of the wicked. Indeed, the sins of the wicked cause the righteous man’s wall to be pulled down. For instance, where there is a party-wall between the house of the wicked and the righteous, and a plague-spot appears in the party-wall on the side of the wicked man’s house [so that the wall must be demolished], the result is that the righteous man’s wall is pulled down through the iniquity of the wicked. R. Ishmael, the son of R. Joḥanan b. Beroḳah, said: Woe to the wicked and woe to his neighbour, since the sins of the wicked cause the righteous man’s wall to be pulled down.

Ex. 32, 1ff.</i>, and once in connection with the spies.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 13, 1ff.</i> The incident of the spies was the gravest of them all, as it is stated, <i>Ye have put Me to proof these ten times, and have not hearkened to My voice</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XIV, 22.</i> And it is similarly [stated], <i>Even those men that did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before the Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 37.</i> Now is there not an inference from the less to the greater? If [for making disparaging remarks about] the Land, which can neither speak, nor blush, nor feel shame, the Holy One, blessed be He, exacted punishment from the spies for its humiliation, how much more will He exact punishment for a man’s humiliation from his fellow who speaks [evil] words against him and puts him to shame!<br>R. Simeon said: Upon those who utter slander does the plague of leprosy fall. We find it so with Aaron and Miriam who slandered Moses and were visited with punishment, as it is stated, <i>And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XII, 1.</i> Why does Scripture mention Miriam’s name first before Aaron’s? It teaches that Zipporah<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The wife of Moses.</i> went and spoke of it to Miriam; Miriam went and spoke of it to Aaron, and both of them arose and spoke ill of that righteous man [Moses]. Because the two of them stood speaking ill of that righteous man, Divine punishment came upon them, as it is stated, <i>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them, and departed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 9, E.V., <i>and He departed</i>.</i> What is the significance of the expression <i>and departed?</i> It suggests that [the leprosy] departed from Aaron<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Shab. 97a (Sonc. ed., p. 464).</i> and attached itself to Miriam, because Aaron did not enter into the details of the matter whereas Miriam did; therefore she was immediately punished with greater severity. Miriam said, ‘To me came the Word yet I did not separate myself from my husband’. Aaron said, ‘To me came the Word yet I did not separate myself from my wife. The Word also came to our fathers of old and they did not separate themselves from their wives. But [Moses], in his arrogance, has separated from his wife!’ They did not criticize him to his face<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">To avoid shaming him to his face.</i> but only behind his back, and their criticism was not stated as a fact but only as a surmise; since it was a matter of doubt whether he had acted so from arrogance or not. Now is there not here an inference from the less to the greater? If Miriam, who spoke only against her brother, spoke only in [22<i>a</i>] secret<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">The words ‘and spoke only in secret’ are not found in many texts and appear to be redundant. The clause is apparently a doublet of the preceding one.</i> and spoke only behind Moses’ back, was punished, how much greater will be the punishment of an ordinary man who speaks ill to the face of his fellow and puts him to shame!<br>At that time Aaron said to Moses, ‘Moses, my brother, do you think that this leprosy affects only Miriam? It touches also the person of our father Amram. Let me illustrate this to you. To what can the matter be compared? To a man who had taken a glowing coal in his hand; no matter how much he shifts it about from place to place his flesh is still scorched. For so it is stated, <i>Let her not, I pray, be as one dead</i>’.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 12, 12.</i> Thereupon Aaron began to conciliate Moses, saying, ‘ Moses, my brother, have we ever done evil to any person in the world?’ He answered, ‘You have not’. ‘Well then,’ he said, ‘if we have never hurt anyone in the world, how could we hurt you, our brother? What can I do now? It was a misunderstanding between us; we have broken<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">Adopting the variant as given in the margin of V.</i> the covenant between us and you, as it is stated, <i>And remembered not the brotherly covenant</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">Amos 1, 9.</i> Are we to lose our sister because the covenant which was made between us is broken?’ Immediately Moses drew a small circle, stood within it and prayed for mercy on her behalf, saying, ‘I shall not stir from here until my sister Miriam is healed’, as it is stated, <i>Heal her now, O God, I beseech Thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 12, 13.</i> Forthwith the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, ‘If a king had rebuked her, or if her father had rebuked her, would it not be proper that she hide in shame for seven days? Surely, if I, the King of kings, rebuke her, how much more should she hide in shame for fourteen days [at the least]! Yet for your sake I pardon her’. As it is stated, <i>And the Lord said unto Moses: If her father had but spit in her face</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 14.</i> etc.<br><i>Now the man Moses was very meek</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 3.</i> It is possible [to think] he was meek but not handsome and imposing;<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘worthy of praise’.</i> therefore Scripture states, <i>And he spread the tent over the tabernacle:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 40, 19.</i> as the tabernacle was ten cubits in height, so Moses must have been ten cubits tall. It is possible [to think] that he was as meek as the ministering angels; therefore Scripture continues, [<i>Moses was very meek</i>] <i>above all the men:</i> above all men, it is said, but not above the ministering angels. It is possible [to think] that he was as meek as those of the former generations;<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the patriarchs.</i> therefore Scripture continues, <i>Upon the face of the earth</i>, implying above those of his own generation, but not above those of the former generations.<br>Three types of leprous condition were created in the world: the moist, the dry and the polypus;<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Here a type of skin disease; strictly a morbid growth in the nose. Persons so afflicted must feel very lowly.</i> but the soul of Moses was lowlier than them all.
R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Also upon those who utter calumny<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">GRA reads ‘who utter lies’.</i> does the plague [of leprosy] fall. We find it so in the case of Gehazi; because he uttered calumny against his master leprosy clung to him until his dying day, as it is stated, <i>The leprosy, therefore, of Naaman shall cleave unto thee…. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">2 Kings 5, 27.</i><br>He further said: Also upon those who are arrogant does the plague [of leprosy] fall. We find it so in the case of Uzziah, as it is stated, <i>But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up so that he did corruptly, and he trespassed against the Lord his God; for he went unto the temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense. And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him fourscore priests of the Lord, that were valiant men; and they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him: It pertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord, but to the priests the sons of Aaron that are consecrated it pertaineth to burn incense; go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thy honour from the Lord God. Then Uzziah was wrath, and he had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy broke forth in his forehead</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">2 Chron. 26, 16-19.</i> At that moment the sanctuary was split from end to end,<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">By a violent earthquake, alluded to in Zech. 14, 5.</i> and [the chasm covered an area of] twelve square miles. The priests fled in alarm. The king also made haste to go out <i>because the Lord had smitten him. And he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a house set apart, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the Lord; and Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging the people of the land</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">2 Chron. 26, 20f.</i>
<small>ASSOCIATE NOT WITH THE WICKED</small>. This teaches that a man should not associate himself either with an evil man or a wicked man. We find it so in the case of Jehoshaphat; because he associated with Ahab and went up with him to Ramoth Gilead, the wrath of the Lord came upon him, as it is stated, <i>Shouldest thou help the wicked, and love them that hate the Lord? For this thing wrath is upon thee from the Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XIX, 2. The Biblical text is omitted in V but is found in MS. E. and inserted by GRA.</i> And also later when he associated with Ahaziah, and they made themselves ships in Ezion Geber, the Lord wrecked his enterprise, as it is stated, <i>Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the Lord hath made a breach in thy works. And the ships were broken</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XX, 37.</i> So, too, we find with Amnon who associated with Jonadab and received from him bad advice, as it is stated, <i>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very subtle man;</i><sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote">2 Sam. 13, 3.</i> he was <i>subtle</i> to do evil.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">This unusual connotation of <i>ḥakam</i>, translated <i>subtle</i>, is quoted from Sanh. 21a (Sonc. ed., p. 114).</i><br>Another interpretation of <small>ASSOCIATE NOT WITH THE WICKED</small>: even to [bring him near to] the Torah.<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">Although the purpose is laudable, there is always the danger of oneself becoming corrupt by the association. Cf., however, Finkelstein, <i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 19-22.</i>
<small>AND ABANDON NOT BELIEF IN RETRIBUTION</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man’s heart should be daily in fear of retribution<sup class="footnote-marker">43</sup><i class="footnote">The text therefore means: Do not consider yourself exempt from chastisement under the illusion of self-righteousness.</i> and he should say, ‘Woe is me, perhaps reckoning will overtake me to-day or to-morrow’. As a consequence he is fearful every day, as it is stated of Job, <i>For I feared a fear</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Job 3, 25. So ilt., E.V., <i>For the thing which I did fear</i>.</i>
Another interpretation of <small>AND ABANDON NOT BELIEF IN RETRIBUTION</small>. What does this mean? When a man sees that he is successful in whatever he undertakes, let him not say, ‘Because I am meritorious the All-present has provided me with food and drink in this world, while the capital [of my reward] is laid up for me in the world to come’. Rather should he say, ‘Woe is me, perhaps I have only one meritorious deed to my credit before Him, and as a reward for that He has granted me food and drink in this world, so as to cut me off utterly in the world to come’.

J<small>UDAH B.</small> Ṭ<small>ABBAI SAID: ACT NOT AS THOSE THAT WOULD INFLUENCE THE JUDGES; AND WHEN THE SUITORS STAND BEFORE YOU LET THEM BE AS WRONGDOERS IN YOUR SIGHT, AND WHEN THEY HAVE DEPARTED LET THEM BE AS INNOCENT IN YOUR SIGHT, ONCE THEY HAVE ACCEPTED THE JUDGMENT</small>.
<small>ACT NOT AS THOSE THAT WOULD INFLUENCE THE JUDGES</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that if you come to the House of Study and hear a ruling or a decision, be not hasty to dispute it, but sit and ask yourself, ‘Why did they say it? On what grounds did they arrive at their decision?’ Or if they stated a law, ask them first of all the fundamental principle of the law about which they were consulted.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The text is in disorder although the meaning is clear. A warning is issued against a scholar’s hasty criticism of a judge’s decision, and unwarranted interference with a sentence of the Court.</i><br>When two suitors come before you to law, one poor and the other rich, do not say, ‘How can I declare the poor man innocent and the rich man guilty?’ or ‘How can I declare the rich man innocent and the poor man guilty?’ or ‘If I find against the poor man, he will become my enemy; and if I find in favour of the poor man, the rich man will become my enemy.’ Furthermore, do not say, ‘How dare I take the money from one and give it to the other?’ For the Torah declares, <i>Ye shall not respect persons in judgment</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 1, 17.</i><br>R. Meir used to say: What does Scripture intend by the words, <i>Ye shall hear the small and the great alike?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i></i> It means that one suitor should not sit and the other stand; one should not speak all that he wishes and the other be told to be brief. R. Judah said: I have heard that if [the judges] desire both suitors to sit they may do so, and there is no objection to it. What is prohibited is for one to sit and the other to stand.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Shebu. 30a (Sonc. ed., p. 167).</i><br>[Another interpretation:] What is meant by <i>the small and the great alike?</i> A minor law-suit should be as important to you as a major law-suit, a law-suit involving a <i>peruṭah</i> should be as important to you as one involving one hundred <i>mina</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

In both versions the threat is, of course, not meant to be taken seriously.</i> But once I had assumed office, if anyone were to say to me, ‘Give it up’, I would pour a pot of boiling water on his head. For it is a hard thing to assume power, and hard as it is to assume power, it is harder to give it up. We find it so in the case of Saul; when he was asked to assume the regal dignity he hid himself, as it is stated, <i>And the Lord answered: Behold, he hath hid himself among the baggage</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">1 Sam. 10, 22.</i> But when he was told to surrender the crown, he pursued David to kill him.
S<small>IMEON B.</small> S<small>HEṬAḤ SAID: EXAMINE THE WITNESSES THOROUGHLY</small>; and when examining them <small>BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR WORDS</small>, lest through your words those who are listening may add falsehood to them: [a necessary precaution] on account of dishonest persons.

Chapter 11

S<small>HEMAIAH AND</small> A<small>BṬALYON RECEIVED THE TRADITION FROM THE PRECEDING</small>. S<small>HEMAIAH SAID: LOVE WORK AND HATE PUBLIC OFFICE, AND BECOME NOT KNOWN TO THE RULING POWER</small>.<br><small>LOVE WORK</small>. What does this mean? It teaches [22<i>b</i>] that a man should love work and not hate it; for just as the Torah was given [to man] by a covenant, so work too was given by a covenant, as it is stated, <i>Six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work; but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the Lord thy God</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20, 9f. This verse, however, does not contain the word ‘covenant’ required for the purpose of the analogy, and the commentators substitute Ex. 20XI, 15, <i>Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest</i>, etc., concluding with <i>a perpetual covenant</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 16).</i><br>R. ‘Aḳiba said: There are times when a man does work [on the Sabbath] and escapes the penalty of death, and there are times when a man does no work [on the Sabbath] and incurs death by Heaven. How can this be? If a man sat the whole week doing no work and on the eve of the Sabbath, having nothing to eat, took of the sacred money which is in his possession and used it for his needs, he thereby incurred the penalty of death by Heaven.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">For misappropriating Temple funds.</i> On the other hand, if he is at work on the Temple building, although he receives sacred money in payment which he uses for his needs, he escapes the penalty of death.<br>R. Dosethai said: When do we find that if a man does no work all the six days he will eventually have to work all the seven days? If he is idle all the days of the week doing no work, when the Sabbath eve arrives he will have nothing to eat. He then goes forth and joins a band of robbers; he is caught and put in chains, and is now compelled to work [also] on the Sabbath. All this is the sequel of his not working during the six days of the week.<br>R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: Even Adam, the first man, did not taste a morsel until he had done some work, as it is stated, <i>And He put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 2, 15.</i> and only then [is it recorded], <i>Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 16.</i><br>R. Ṭarfon said: Even the Holy One, blessed be He, did not cause His Presence to dwell in Israel until they had performed some work, as it is stated, <i>And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 25, 8.</i><br>R. Judah b. Bathyra said: What should a man do when he has no work to undertake? If he has a dilapidated courtyard or a waste field let him go and attend to it;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Rather than be idle.</i> for it is stated, <i>Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XX, 9.</i> Why does the verse add the words <i>and do all thy work?</i> To include the case of a man who has dilapidated courtyards or waste fields, that he should go and occupy himself with them.<br>R. Jose<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">So in all MSS.; V reads: R. Ṭarfon.</i> said: No man dies except in idleness, as it is stated, <i>And he expired, and was gathered unto his people</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 49, 33. The term <i>he expired</i> is interpreted as ‘he ceased to work’, and when idleness set in death follows. Schechter suggests that the proof-text should read, <i>And they shall die without knowledge</i> (Job 36, 12) which follows immediately on <i>If they hearken and work</i> [E.V., <i>serve Him</i>], <i>they shall spend their days in prosperity</i> (<i>ibid.</i> 11). This is Scriptural proof that work leads to prosperity, idleness to death.</i> Hence if a man had a seizure, came under the care of his physician and died, he only died because he was in idleness.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. through inability to work.</i> If a man was standing [idly] on the top of a roof or a castle or a building or by the river’s edge and fell and died, he only died because he was in idleness.<br>We have heard this<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The duty to work.</i> in connection with men, but whence in connection with women? As it is stated, <i>Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 36, 6.</i> And whence in connection with children? As it is stated, <i>So the people were restrained from bringing</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i>; the term <i>people</i> includes the young.</i><br>R. Nathan said: At the time that Moses was engaged upon the work of the Tabernacle, he declined to consult with the princes of Israel. Consequently they sat in silence, thinking to themselves, ‘The time will soon come when Moses will have need of us’. When they heard the proclamation made in the camp which declared, <i>The stuff they had was sufficient</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 7.</i> they exclaimed, ‘Alas, we have had no share in the work of the Tabernacle!’ They arose and added a large contribution of their own accord, as it is stated, <i>And the rulers brought the onyx stones</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XXXV, 27.</i>
<small>AND HATE PUBLIC OFFICE</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that no man should himself put a crown on his head, but others should put it on him; as it is stated, <i>Let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 27, 2.</i><br>R. ‘Aḳiba said: Whoever exalts himself by his knowledge of Torah, to what is he like? To a carcase which lies in the road, anybody passing by puts his hand to his nose and moves far away from it; as it is stated, <i>If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast planned devices, lay thy hand upon thy mouth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XXX, 32.</i> Ben ‘Azzai said to him, ‘Interpret the text in this sense: If a man debases himself for the sake of Torah, eats dry dates, wears shabby clothes, and sits and keeps guard at the door of the wise, though every passer-by may think him a fool, in the end you will find that the whole Torah is within him’.<br>R. Jose said: Go down and you will be up,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">A fine pithy saying. The more humble a man is, the higher he stands in the estimation of his fellows.</i> go up and you will be down. He who exalts himself by his knowledge of Torah will in the end be brought low; he who humbles himself by his knowledge of Torah will in the end be exalted.
<small>AND BECOME NOT KNOWN TO THE RULING POWER</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should not wish to have a reputation [for wealth] with the ruling powers,<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">The harsh sentiments expressed here refer particularly to the cruel and despotic rule of the Roman local governors in the Herodian era.</i> because if this happens they will eventually have their eyes upon him, put him to death and confiscate all his wealth. [Similarly, a man should not cause a reputation for wealth to be spread abroad about his neighbour among the ruling powers.]<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Inserted by GRA. This is the maxim for the illustration that follows.</i> Thus if a man meets his friend in the market and exclaims, ‘May the Holy One, blessed be He, bless that man [still more]! Only to-day there came from his establishment a hundred oxen, a hundred sheep and a hundred goats!’, an inspector may hear it and proceed to inform the governor, who has the man’s house surrounded and confiscates all his wealth. Of such a man Scripture says, <i>He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice … it is counted a curse to him</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XXVII, 14. E.V., <i>it shall be counted</i>.</i><br>Another interpretation of <small>AND BECOME NOT KNOWN TO THE RULING POWER</small>. A man’s friend is sitting in the market and the former exclaims, ‘May the Holy One, blessed be He, bestow still more blessings upon him! To-day he brought into his house so many <i>kors</i> of wheat and so many <i>kors</i> of barley!’ Robbers hear of it and come and surround his house, taking away all his wealth, so that in the morning he is left with nothing. Of such a man Scripture says, <i>He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice</i>, etc.<br>Another interpretation of <small>AND BECOME NOT KNOWN TO THE RULING POWER</small>. What does it mean? It teaches that a man should not intend [to occupy office] in order to say, ‘I am the city’s governor’, or ‘I am the deputy-governor’, because they rob Israel.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">A curious passage and its meaning is obscure. Perhaps the explanation is to be sought in Midrash Rabbah, Genesis 76, §6 (Sonc. ed., p. 706), which tells that the Romans used to offer petty local governorships to wealthy Jews in order to hold them responsible for the collection of the taxes and other impositions. As in many cases the taxes were unjustly levied, they who occupied these offices were assisting in robbing their own brethren.</i>
Another interpretation: A man should not have the intention [to occupy] a governmental position, for though in the beginning they show him favour, ultimately they trouble him sorely.<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘they open to him a door that is pleasant … a door that is harsh’.</i>
A<small>BṬALYON SAID: WISE MEN, BE HEEDFUL OF YOUR WORDS</small>, lest men teach doctrines in your name not in accord with the Torah, and <small>YOU THEREBY INCUR THE PENALTY OF EXILE, AND ARE EXILED TO A PLACE OF EVIL WATERS</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. exiled among the nations where pernicious and heretical ideas are current.</i> Moreover, the disciples who come after you may also teach doctrines in your name not in accord with the Torah, and they too incur the penalty of exile and are exiled to a place of evil waters.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote">V repeats ‘and you thereby incur’, etc.</i> What is to be understood by ‘evil waters’? That which is implied in the verse, <i>But they mingled themselves with the nations, and learned their works</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 106, 35. ‘Evil waters’ has to be interpreted metaphorically.</i> Others say: The phrase ‘evil waters’ bears its literal significance.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote">Unhealthy waters, productive of physical ills.</i> Another view is: [The meaning is] lest they be exiled for hard labour.

H<small>ILLEL AND</small> S<small>HAMMAI RECEIVED THE TRADITION FROM THE PRECEDING</small>.

<small>LOVING PEACE</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should love [to foster] peace in Israel between man and man, just as Aaron loved [to foster] peace in Israel between man and man, as it is stated, <i>The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips; he walked with Me in peace and uprightness, and did turn many away from iniquity</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Mal. 2, 6.</i> R. Meir said: What is meant by <i>and did turn many away from iniquity?</i> Whenever Aaron walked along the road and met a wicked man, he would offer him greetings. On the following day when that man was about to commit a transgression, he would say, ‘Woe is me! How can I raise my eyes after doing that and look Aaron in the face? I should be ashamed before him, since he greeted me’. Consequently that man withholds himself from transgression.<br>Similarly, when two men had quarrelled one with the other, Aaron would go and sit with one of them and say, ‘My son, see what your companion is doing!<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">So according to GRA; V reads ‘saying’.</i> He beats his breast and tears his clothes, exclaiming, “Woe is me! how can I raise my eyes and look my companion in the face?

Then Aaron would go and sit with the other and say likewise, ‘My son, see what your companion is doing! He beats his breast and tears his clothes, exclaiming, “Woe is me! how can I raise my eyes and look my companion in the face? I am ashamed before him since it was I who offended him” ’. Aaron would sit with him until he had removed all enmity from his heart. Later when the two met, they embraced and kissed each other. Therefore it is stated, <i>They wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 20, 29.</i>
Another interpretation—why was it that for Aaron <i>all the house of Israel</i> wept thirty days, i.e. the men as well as the women? Because Aaron judged everyone favourably,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The usual and literal connotation of the phrase is: ‘he judged a judgment of truth according to its truth’, i.e. he dealt out justice strictly and in all its severity. This quality, however, is inapplicable to Aaron in this context where he is described as overlooking faults. In the parallel passage in the Yalḳuṭ on the verse in Num. <i>ibid.</i>, this phrase is descriptive of Moses and not of Aaron; consequently the commentators have resorted to emendation here in order to make the passages correspond (cf. GRA and the Glosses of J. Bachrach). The translation given in the text retains the original reading and is to be interpreted: he regarded every matter in the light of truth, i.e. he considered every person’s action as right (he ‘gave him right’), or at least endeavoured to see justification in every person’s action, taking a favourable view of it. Cf. the expression in Aboth 1:6, ‘Judge all men in the scale of merit’.</i> for he never said to any man or any woman, ‘You have done wrong’. Therefore it is written of him that <i>all the house of Israel</i> wept for him. Of Moses, on the other hand, who rebuked the people with harsh words, it is stated, <i>And all the children of Israel wept for Moses</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 34, 8.</i> Moreover, many thousands in Israel were given the name Aaron, since but for him they would not have come into the world, because he was the peacemaker between husband and wife. When [after being reconciled] they were united, they would name the child who was born after him. [23<i>a</i>]<br>Others say that for this reason it is stated, <i>And they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel</i>—because who could look upon Moses our teacher sitting and weeping and himself not weep? Others express it in this way: Who could look upon Eleazar and Phinehas,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The son and grandson of Aaron respectively.</i> the two High Priests, standing and weeping and himself not weep?<br>
At that time Moses wished to die in the same manner as Aaron had died; because he saw Aaron’s couch arrayed in great splendour, and hosts of ministering angels lamenting him. Did Moses express this desire in the hearing of another person? No, he only expressed the wish to himself and the Holy One, blessed be He, heard his whisper [and granted his wish,] as it is stated, <i>And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 32, 50.</i> From this you may infer that Moses wished to die the same death as Aaron.<br>At that hour [when Moses was to die], He said to the angel of death, ‘Go and bring Me the soul of Moses’. The angel of death went and stood before him and said, ‘Moses, deliver your soul to me’. Moses rebuked him saying, ‘In the place where I am seated you have not the right to stand,<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">For Moses was engaged in the study of the Torah, and the angel of death cannot approach one who is so engaged; cf. Shab. 30b (Sonc. ed., p. 134).</i> yet you say to me, “Deliver your soul to me” ’. He rebuked him and drove him away in anger. At length the Holy One, blessed be He, [intervened and] said to Moses, ‘Moses, you have had enough of this world; the world to come awaits you since the six days of creation’, as it is stated, <i>And the Lord said: Behold there is a place by Me, and thou shalt stand upon the rock</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 33, 21.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, took the soul of Moses and stored it under the Throne of Glory, as it is stated, <i>The soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">1 Sam. 25, 29.</i> When He took his soul it was with a kiss, as it is stated, <i>By the mouth of the Lord</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 34, 5. So lit.; E.V., <i>according to the word of the Lord</i>.</i><br>Not only the soul of Moses is stored under the Throne of Glory but the souls of the righteous are also stored there, as it is stated, <i>The soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the Lord thy God</i>. It is possible [to think that] it is the same with the souls of the wicked; therefore Scripture declares, <i>And the souls of thine enemies, them shall He sling out as from the hollow of a sling</i><sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">1 Sam. <i>ibid.</i></i>. To what may this be compared? To a man who took a stone and placed it in a sling; though he hurls it from place to place he knows not where it will come to rest. Similarly, the souls of the wicked are held fast [as in a vice],<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘muzzled’; cf. Shab. 152b (Sonc. ed., p. 779) and Rashi’s comment <i>ad loc.</i></i> and driven about aimlessly in the world, knowing not whereon to rest.<br>Again said He to the angel of death, ‘Go and bring Me the soul of Moses’. He went and searched for him in his usual place but could not find him. He went to the Great Sea and asked, ‘Has Moses been here?’ The Sea replied, ‘Since the day Israel passed through me I have not seen him’. He went to the mountains and hills and asked, ‘Has Moses been here?’ They replied, ‘Since the day Israel received the Torah on Mount Sinai we have not seen him’. He then went to Sheol and Abaddon<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘[place of] Destruction’; used in the Bible as a term for Sheol (Job 26, 6) death (<i>ibid.</i> XXVIII, 22) and the grave (Ps. 88, 12).</i> and asked, ‘Has Moses been here?’ They replied, ‘We have heard his name but have not seen him’. He went to the ministering angels and asked, ‘Has Moses been here?’ They replied, ‘<i>God understandeth his way, and He knoweth his place</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Job 28, 23, E.V., <i>the way thereof … the place thereof</i>.</i> God has hidden him away for life in the world to come, and no creature knows his whereabouts’, as it is stated, <i>But wisdom, where shall it be found? And where is the place of understanding? Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living. The deep saith: It is not in me; and the sea saith: It is not with me</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 12-14. The passage is related to Moses who possessed the wisdom of the Torah.</i> <i>Destruction and Death say: We have heard a rumour thereof with our ears</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 22.</i> Joshua also was sitting and grieving over Moses, because he did not know where he was, until the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘Joshua, why do you grieve for Moses? <i>Moses My servant is dead</i>’.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Josh. 1, 2.</i>
<small>PURSUING PEACE</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should pursue peace in Israel among all men in the same way that Aaron pursued peace in Israel among all men; as it is stated, <i>Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 34, 15.</i> R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: If a man stays at home in quietude, how can he pursue peace in Israel among all men? He should rather leave his home and go about the world so that he can pursue peace in Israel, as it is stated, <i>Seek peace, and pursue it</i>: meaning <i>seek peace</i> in your own place, <i>and pursue it</i> by going elsewhere.<br>Even the Holy One, blessed be He, made peace on high.<sup class="footnote-marker">21</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Job 25, 2.</i> What manner of peace did He make on high? By not naming ten [angels] ‘Gabriel’, ten ‘Michael’, ten ‘Uriel’, or ten ‘Raphael’, after the manner of men who name ten [persons] ‘Reuben’, ten ‘Simeon’, ten ‘Levi’, or ten ‘Judah’. Had He done as men do, on summoning one [angel, all bearing that name] would come before Him and they would be envious of one another. He therefore named one [angel] ‘Gabriel’ and one ‘Michael’, so that when He summons an angel [by name] only one appears before Him and is sent wherever He wishes. And whence do we know that [the angels] reverence one another, respect one another, and are more humble than human beings? When they are about to open their mouths to sing hymns, one says to the other, ‘You begin, for you are greater than I’; and the other replies, ‘No, you begin, for you are greater than I’. This is quite unlike the behaviour of human beings, everyone saying to his fellow, ‘I am greater than you’. According to another view [the courteous remarks are made by] groups of angels, one group saying to the other, ‘You begin, for you are greater than we’; as it is stated, <i>And one called unto another, and said</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">22</sup><i class="footnote">Is. 6, 3 where the reference is to groups of seraphim.</i>
<small>LOVING MANKIND</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should love his fellow-creatures and not hate them; for so we find it among the men of the generation of the Dispersion. Since they loved one another,<sup class="footnote-marker">23</sup><i class="footnote">This is inferred from the statement that they were <i>of one language and of one speech</i> (Gen. 11, 1).</i> the Holy One, blessed be He, did not wish to destroy them, but dispersed them to the four corners of the earth.<sup class="footnote-marker">24</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 8.</i> Because the men of Sodom, on the other hand, hated one another, the Holy One, blessed be He, destroyed them from this world and the world to come; as it is stated, <i>The men of Sodom were wicked and sinners against the Lord exceedingly</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">25</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XIII, 13.</i> [<i>Wicked</i> signifies that they hated one another;]<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">Inserted by GRA; it is also found in all the parallel passages.</i> <i>sinners</i>, that they offended against morality; <i>against the Lord</i>, that they profaned the Name; <i>exceedingly</i>, that they sinned with premeditation. Hence you learn that because they hated one another, the Holy One, blessed be He, destroyed them from this world and from the world to come.
<small>AND BRINGING THEM NEAR TO THE TORAH</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should prevail upon his fellows and bring them beneath the wings of the Divine Presence, as our father Abraham used to prevail upon men and bring them beneath the wings of the Divine Presence. Not only Abraham did this, but also Sarah, as it is stated, <i>And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had made in Haran</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">27</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XII, 5; so lit.; E.V., <i>had gotten in Haran</i>. [Midrash Rabbah, Genesis, XXXIX, 14 (Sonc. ed., p. 324) explains it of the proselytes made by Abraham and Sarah.]</i> Is it not a fact that all mankind cannot create even a gnat? How, then, can Scripture declare, <i>And the souls that they had</i> made <i>in Haran!</i> It teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, accounted it to them as though they had created them.<br><sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph is clearly out of place here; it is inserted by GRA after the first sentence in the paragraph which follows.</i> Just as a man does not share his fellow’s reward in this world, so a man does not share his fellow’s reward in the world to come; as it is stated, <i>And behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they had no comforter</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">29</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 4, 1.</i> Why does the verse repeat <i>they had no comforter?</i> It speaks of those men who in this world eat and drink and are fortunate in their sons and daughters, but in the world to come have nothing<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">Because they did not live a good life but a life of self-centred pleasure.</i> and are without a comforter. In this world, if a man has been robbed or suffered a bereavement, his sons, brothers and kinsmen come to comfort him. It is possible [to imagine] that it is the same in the world to come; therefore Scripture declares, <i>He hath neither son nor brother</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 8.</i> Similarly, if a man sins and begets an illegitimate child, they say to him, ‘Fool that you are! You have harmed yourself and also the child’. For that illegitimate son may be desirous of studying Torah together with the scholars who sit and study in Jerusalem. He joins their company until they reach Ashdod; there he halts and cries, ‘Woe is me! Had I not been of illegitimate birth, I should now be studying with those who were hitherto my fellow-students; but being illegitimate I may not sit and study with them because an illegitimate is not allowed to enter Jerusalem; as it is stated, <i>And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">32</sup><i class="footnote">Zech. 9, 6.</i>
<small>HE USED TO SAY: IF I AM NOT FOR MYSELF, WHO IS FOR ME</small>? If I do not win merit for myself in my lifetime, who will do so for me?<sup class="footnote-marker">33</sup><i class="footnote">According to GRA the preceding paragraph should follow here.</i> <small>AND IF I AM ONLY FOR MYSELF, WHAT AM I</small>? If I have won merit for myself alone, what have I achieved?<sup class="footnote-marker">34</sup><i class="footnote">V reads ‘If I do not win merit for myself, who will do so for me?’ This cannot be correct because it merely repeats the preceding sentence. The translation in the text is based on a suggestion by Schechter <i>ad loc.</i></i> <small>AND IF NOT NOW, WHEN</small>? If I do not win merit for myself in my lifetime, who will do so for me after my death? As Scripture declares, <i>For a living dog is better than a dead lion</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">35</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 9, 4.</i> <i>A living dog is better</i> refers to a wicked man while he exists in this world;<sup class="footnote-marker">36</sup><i class="footnote">Because as long as he is alive there is hope that he may repent.</i> <i>than a dead lion</i> refers to the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob who sleep in the dust.<sup class="footnote-marker">37</sup><i class="footnote">And all their achievements have come to an end.</i><br>Another interpretation: <i>A living dog is better</i> refers to a wicked man while he exists in this world, because if he repents the Holy One, blessed be He, receives him; whereas a righteous man, once dead, cannot add to his merits.
He used to say: If you will come to my house I will go to yours. Wheresoever my heart desires [to go] there my feet lead me.<sup class="footnote-marker">38</sup><i class="footnote">Quoted as a saying of Hillel in Suk. 53a (Sonc. ed., p. 253).</i><br>‘If you will come to my house I will go to yours.’ What does this mean? It refers to the persons who are found in the Synagogues and Houses of Study early in the morning and late at night. The Holy One, blessed be He, will bless them in the world to come, in accordance with what is stated, <i>In every place where I cause My name to be mentioned I will come unto thee and bless thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">39</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 20, 21.</i><br>‘Wheresoever my heart desires [to go] there my feet lead me.’ What does this mean? It refers to the persons who leave their silver and gold behind and go up [to Jerusalem] for the Festival to appear before the Divine Presence in the Temple. The Holy One, blessed be He, stands on guard for them in the midst of their homesteads, as it is stated, <i>Neither shall any man covet thy land, when thou goest up to appear before the Lord thy God</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">40</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XXXIV, 24.</i>
He used to say: If I am here, all are here; if I am not here, who is here?<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">A continuation of the passage quoted from Suk. 53a.</i> Turn it<sup class="footnote-marker">42</sup><i class="footnote">The Torah.</i> and turn it again, for everything [23<i>b</i>] is in it.

Some scholars interpret ‘Bag’ as an abbreviation of ‘Ben Ger’ (son of a proselyte) and conjecture that ‘Bag’ and ‘He’ are identical, the numerical value of BG, being five, indicated by the letter <i>he</i>.]</i>
The story is told of Hillel the Elder that he was walking along the road when he met some men carrying wheat. He asked them, ‘How much a <i>se’ah?</i>’ They replied, ‘Two <i>dinars</i>’. Later he met other men [carrying wheat] and he asked them, ‘How much a <i>se’ah?</i>’ They replied, ‘Three <i>dinars</i>.’ He said to them, ‘But those who were in front of you only asked two <i>dinars</i>’. They rejoined, ‘You stupid Babylonian, do you not know the rule: according to the labour so is the reward?’<sup class="footnote-marker">44</sup><i class="footnote">Since the latter had brought the wheat from a longer distance their charge was higher.</i> He said to them, ‘You foolish and empty-headed persons! Because I ask you [a civil question], do you answer me [rudely]?’ Nevertheless Hillel the Elder so affected them that he turned them on to the good path.<br><small>MOREOVER, HE SAW A SKULL FLOATING ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER; HE SAID TO IT, ‘BECAUSE YOU DROWNED OTHERS THEY DROWNED YOU, AND THEY THAT DROWNED YOU WILL THEMSELVES BE DROWNED</small>’.<sup class="footnote-marker">45</sup><i class="footnote">Quoted from a maxim of Hillel in Aboth 2:7 (Sonc. ed., II, 6, p. 16).

He also said the following four [aphorisms] in Aramaic: <small>WHOSOEVER MAKES GREAT HIS NAME LOSES HIS NAME; HE WHO DOES NOT WAIT UPON SCHOLARS DESERVES DEATH; HE WHO DOES NOT INCREASE HIS KNOWLEDGE LOSES WHAT HE HAS; AND HE WHO MAKES USE OF THE CROWN WILL PASS AWAY AND PERISH</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">46</sup><i class="footnote">A quotation from Aboth 1:13, with variants, the most important being in the third saying which reads in the Mishnaic version, ‘he who does not study deserves death’. [The version given here, ‘he who does not wait’, etc., occurs in Nazir VII, 1, 56b, where it is attributed to R. ‘Aḳiba.]</i><br><small>WHOEVER MAKES GREAT HIS NAME LOSES HIS NAME</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should not spread abroad of himself a reputation [for wealth] in the kingdom, because if he does so, before long the authorities will cast their eyes upon him, kill him, and confiscate his wealth.<sup class="footnote-marker">47</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. XI, 3, above, p. 68.</i><br><small>HE WHO DOES NOT WAIT UPON SCHOLARS DESERVES DEATH</small>. What does it mean? The story is told of a certain man of Beth-Ramah<sup class="footnote-marker">48</sup><i class="footnote">The modern Beit Rima, about 20 miles north-west of Jerusalem.</i> who used to conduct himself in the strictest piety, that Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai once sent a disciple to him to test him in his conduct.<sup class="footnote-marker">49</sup><i class="footnote">Since, as stated later, the man was the High Priest, who generally belonged to the Sadducean party, Rabban Joḥanan investigated a report that he followed Pharasaic teaching and practice (cf. Finkelstein, <i>op. cit.</i>, pp. 152f).</i> When he arrived, he found that the man took some oil and set it on the oven-range [to be warmed], then he removed it from the range and poured it into a dish of crushed beans. On being asked what he was doing, the man replied, ‘I am a High Priest<sup class="footnote-marker">50</sup><i class="footnote">Not necessarily the High Priest in office at the time, but who had served at one time in that office and had therefore retained the title.</i> and I always eat <i>terumah</i> in conditions of cleanness’. ‘Is this oven-range clean or unclean?’ [the disciple] asked him, and he answered, ‘Is it ever mentioned in the Torah about an oven-range being unclean? Surely the Torah speaks only of a common oven as being unclean; as it is stated, <i>Whatsoever is in it shall be unclean</i>’.<sup class="footnote-marker">51</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 11, 33, where the reference is to an <i>earthen vessel</i>.</i> The other retorted, ‘Just as the Torah speaks of a common oven as being unclean, so it likewise speaks of an oven-range as being unclean; for it is stated, <i>Whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces; they are unclean</i>’.<sup class="footnote-marker">52</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 35.</i> He added, ‘If that is what you were accustomed to do, you have never eaten clean <i>terumah</i> in your life’.<br><small>HE WHO DOES NOT INCREASE HIS KNOWLEDGE LOSES WHAT HE HAS</small>.

It teaches that if a man has studied one tractate, or even two or three tractates, and does not add anything thereto, eventually he will forget what he learnt in the beginning.<br><small>AND HE WHO MAKES USE OF THE CROWN WILL PASS AWAY AND PERISH</small>. What does this mean?

Chapter 13

S<small>HAMMAI SAID: MAKE YOUR STUDY OF THE TORAH A FIXED HABIT; SAY LITTLE AND DO MUCH; AND RECEIVE ALL MEN WITH A CHEERFUL COUNTENANCE</small>.
<small>MAKE YOUR STUDY OF THE TORAH A FIXED HABIT</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that if a man hears a theme from a Sage in the House of Study, he should not treat it as something casual, but should regard it as a fixed norm. Moreover, what a man learns he should perform and teach to others that they, too, may perform it; as it is stated, <i>That ye may learn them, and observe to do them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 5, 1.</i> It similarly states of Ezra, <i>For Ezra had set his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Ezra 7, 10.</i> the verse continuing, <i>And to teach in Israel statutes and ordinances</i>.
<small>SAY LITTLE AND DO MUCH</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that the righteous say little and do much, whereas the wicked say much and do not even a little. Whence do we know that the righteous say little and do much? We find it so with Abraham our father who said to the angels, ‘You will eat with me to-day a morsel of bread’; as it is stated, <i>And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and stay ye your heart</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 18, 5.</i> But in the end, see how much Abraham prepared for the ministering angels—he went and prepared for them three oxen and nine measures of fine flour! Whence do we know that he prepared for them nine measures of fine flour? For it is stated, <i>And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said: Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 6.</i> Now the word <i>three</i> signifies literally what it says; <i>fine</i> also implies three making six; and <i>meal</i> implies a further three, making nine in all. And whence do we know that he prepared for them three oxen? For it is stated, <i>And Abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender</i> [<i>and good</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 7.</i> Now the word <i>herd</i> implies one, <i>calf</i> implies another making two, and <i>tender</i> implies a third, thus making three in all. Some say that the word <i>good</i> implies a fourth. <i>And he gave them unto the servant, and he hastened to dress them:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> E.V., <i>gave it … dress it</i>.</i> he gave them to his son Ishmael in order to train him in the performance of good deeds.<br>The Holy One, blessed be He, likewise said little and did much; as it is stated, <i>And He said unto Abram: Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years; and also that nation whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they come out with great substance</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XV, 13f. The Heb. for <i>judge</i> is <i>dan</i>, a word of only two letters.</i> [In His announcement] He only used a word of two letters, <i>daleth</i> and <i>nun</i>; eventually when the Holy One, blessed be He, inflicted punishment upon the enemies of Israel, He did so with seventy-two letters; as it is stated, <i>Or hath God assayed to go and take Him a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an out-stretched arm, and by great terrors?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 4, 34. There are 75 letters in the Heb. text quoted, beginning with <i>to go</i>. The Midrash Rabbah, Leviticus, XXIII, §2 (Sonc. ed., p. 293) and Song of Songs 2, §2 (Sonc. ed., p. 95), suggests that the second <i>nation</i>, a word of three letters in Heb. (<i>goï</i>), should be omitted from the enumeration. The virtue of the number 72 lies in the fact that one of the sacred Names consists of 72 letters.</i> Hence you learn that when He inflicted punishment upon Israel’s enemies He only did so with seventy-two letters.<br>And whence do we know that the wicked say much and do not even a little? We find it so with Ephron who said to Abraham, <i>A piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver</i>, [<i>what is that betwixt me and thee</i>]<i>?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 23, 15. This verse suggests that the land is of so little value that it is unworthy of their further discussion.</i> Eventually when Abraham weighed out the silver for him, it is stated, <i>And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver …</i> [<i>current money with the merchant</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 16. Ephron insisted upon the fullest value of the money although at first he regarded the transaction as of little significance.</i>
<small>AND RECEIVE ALL MEN WITH A CHEERFUL COUNTENANCE</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that if a man presents the most precious gifts in the world to his fellow but gives them with a sullen countenance, Scripture regards him as having presented him with nothing. On the other hand, he who receives his fellow with a cheerful countenance, though he give him nothing, Scripture accounts it to him as though he had presented him with the most precious gifts in the world.

When the son of Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai died, his disciples came in to console him. R. Eliezer came and sat before him and said, ‘My master, is it your wish that I say a word in your presence?’ He replied to him, ‘Speak’. Thereupon he said, ‘Adam, the first man, had a son who died, and he allowed himself to be comforted in his loss. And whence do we know that he accepted condolence?

Chapter 15

<small>THEY EACH SAID THREE THINGS</small>. R. E<small>LIEZER SAID: LET THE HONOUR OF YOUR FELLOW BE DEAR TO YOU AS YOUR OWN; BE NOT EASILY MOVED TO ANGER; REPENT ONE DAY BEFORE YOUR DEATH</small>.<br><small>LET THE HONOUR OF YOUR FELLOW BE DEAR TO YOU AS YOUR OWN</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that as a man regards his own honour, so should he regard the honour of his fellow; and as a man would not wish to see an ill report spread about his own honour, so should he not wish to see an ill report spread about the honour of his fellow.<br>Another interpretation of <small>LET THE HONOUR OF YOUR FELLOW BE DEAR TO YOU AS YOUR OWN</small>: Thus if a man once possessed a million and is now deprived of all his wealth, he should not lose his self-respect even to the slightest degree.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">lit., ‘to the value of a <i>peruṭah</i>’. Though he is destitute his self-esteem should remain high; cf. Sanh. 92b (Sonc. ed., p. 621): ‘Even in times of danger one should not lay aside his insignia of office’. Honour is a precious possession.</i>
<small>BE NOT EASILY MOVED TO ANGER</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should be meek like Hillel the Elder and not impatient like Shammai the Elder.<br>What was the meekness of Hillel the Elder? It is related<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Shab. 31a (Sonc. ed., pp. 138ff) for variants of this passage.</i> that two men once wagered with each other the sum of four hundred <i>zuz</i>, saying, ‘Whoever will succeed in provoking Hillel to anger will take the four hundred <i>zuz</i>’. One of them went [to call on Hillel]. The day was the eve of the Sabbath towards dusk, and Hillel was then washing his head. He came, knocked at the door, and called out, ‘Where is Hillel? Where is Hillel?’ Hillel wrapped himself in his robe and went to him, asking, ‘My son, what do you require?’ ‘I have a question to ask,’ he said. ‘Ask it,’ said Hillel. Thereupon he asked, ‘Why are the inhabitants of Palmyra bleary-eyed?’ He answered, ‘Because they live in sandy deserts, and the winds scatter the sand over their eyes; for that reason their eyes are bleary’. The man departed, waited a while, returned, again knocked at the door, and called out, ‘Where is Hillel? Where is Hillel?’ Hillel wrapped himself in his robe and went out to him, asking, ‘My son, what do you require?’ ‘I have a question<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The Heb. <i>halakah</i>, the term for a legal decision, cannot have this meaning here.</i> to ask,’ he said. ‘Ask it,’ said Hillel. Thereupon he asked, ‘Why have the Africans flat feet?’ He answered, ‘Because they live in marshy places and constantly walk in the water;<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">They therefore walk barefoot, and so their feet are broad because of not having been cramped by shoe or sandal.</i> for that reason their feet are flat’. The man departed, waited a while, returned, again knocked at the door and called out, ‘Where is Hillel? Where is Hillel?’ He wrapped himself in his robe, and went out to him, asking, ‘What do you wish to ask?’ ‘I have a question to ask,’ he said. ‘Ask it,’ said Hillel. The man then wrapped himself in his cloak and sat down before him. ‘What do you wish to ask?’ said Hillel. The other rejoined, ‘Is that the manner in which a President<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The Heb. is in the plural, referring to the Presidents of the Sanhedrin.</i> replies? May there not be many like you in Israel!’ ‘Heaven forfend!’ exclaimed Hillel, ‘mind your temper. What is it you require?’ He asked, ‘Why have the Babylonians long heads?’<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">An insulting remark since Babylon was Hillel’s birthplace.</i> He answered, ‘My son, you have asked an important question. Because they lack skilful midwives there, as soon as a child is born it is placed in the arms<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Heb. is <i>’ebarim</i>, ‘limbs’, a peculiar word in the context. A variant is <i>ḥeḳ</i>, ‘bosom’.</i> of male and female slaves; for that reason their heads are long. Here [in the Holy Land] there are expert midwives, and as soon as a child is born it is placed in a cot and its head is massaged; for that reason their heads are round’. Then said the man to him, ‘Through you I have lost four hundred <i>zuz</i>’. Hillel retorted, ‘Hillel is worthy that you should lose [twice] four hundred <i>zuz</i> on his account, and Hillel should not lose his temper’.
What was the impatience of Shammai the Elder? It is related that a man<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">In Shab., <i>loc. cit.</i>, he was ‘a Gentile’, but in the context a Jew is clearly intended.</i> once came and stood before Shammai and said to him, ‘Master, how many Torahs have you?’ He answered, ‘Two, one written and one oral’. The man said, ‘I believe you regarding the written, but I do not believe you regarding the oral’. Shammai rebuked him and [24<i>b</i>] angrily drove him away. The man then came before Hillel and asked, ‘Master, how many Torahs were given [to Israel]’. He answered, ‘Two, one written and one oral’. He said, ‘I believe you regarding the written, but I do not believe you regarding the oral’. Hillel said to him, ‘My son, take a seat’. He then wrote the alphabet for him. Hillel asked him, ‘What is this letter?’<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Pointing to an <i>alef</i>.</i> ‘An <i>alef</i>,’ he replied. Hillel said, ‘It is not an <i>alef</i> but a <i>beth</i>’. He asked, ‘And what is this letter?’<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">Pointing to a <i>beth</i>.</i> ‘A <i>beth</i>,’ he replied. Hillel said, ‘It is not a <i>beth</i> but a <i>gimel</i>’. ‘Moreover, how do you know that this letter is <i>alef</i>, that <i>beth</i>, and the other <i>gimel?</i>’ continued Hillel. He replied, ‘So it has been handed down to us by our forebears: this is <i>alef</i>, that <i>beth</i>, and the other <i>gimel</i>’. ‘Just as you have accepted this<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The letters of the alphabet.</i> on trust, so accept the other<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">The existence of two Torahs.</i> on trust.’<br>Once a gentile was passing behind a Synagogue when he heard a child reciting the verse, <i>And these are the garments which they shall make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and a robe</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 28, 4.</i> He came to Shammai and asked him, ‘Master, for whom is all that finery?’ He answered, ‘For the High Priest who stands and ministers at the altar’. The gentile said to him, ‘Make me a proselyte on condition that you appoint me High Priest’. Shammai retorted, ‘Is there no priest in Israel and have we no High Priests in Israel to serve in the High-priesthood, except this insignificant proselyte who comes with staff and scrip only and wishes to minister as High Priest?’ He rebuked him and angrily drove him away. The gentile then came to Hillel and said to him, ‘Master, make me a proselyte on condition that you appoint me High Priest, so that I may stand and minister at the altar’. Hillel said to him, ‘Take a seat, and I will tell you something. If a man wishes to have an audience of a human king, is it not proper for him to learn how to make his entrance and his exit?’ ‘Certainly,’ answered the gentile. Hillel continued, ‘As you are desirous to have an audience of the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, is it not all the more incumbent upon you to learn how to enter the Holy of Holies, how to trim the lamps, how to approach the altar, how to order the table, how to arrange the altar-pile?’ ‘Do whatever seems good to you,’ said the gentile. Hillel then wrote the alphabet for him which he soon learnt, and then [he studied] the Book of Leviticus. So he continued until he reached the verse, <i>And the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 1, 51.</i> Then the proselyte reasoned within himself thus, ‘If Israelites who are designated sons of the All-present,<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Deut. 14, 1.</i> of whom the Divine Presence declares, <i>Ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 19, 6.</i> are warned by Scripture, <i>And the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death</i>, how much more so does it apply to me, an insignificant proselyte, who am come with nothing but my scrip!’ In this manner the proselyte was reconciled of his own accord. He came to Hillel the Elder and said to him, ‘May all the blessings of the Torah alight on your head! Had you been like Shammai the Elder, I would never have entered the assembly of Israel. The impatience of Shammai sought to destroy me out of this world and out of the world to come; your gentleness brought me to life in this world and in the world to come’. It is reported that that proselyte became the father of two sons; one he named Hillel and the other Gamaliel. They were called ‘Hillel’s proselytes’.
<small>REPENT ONE DAY BEFORE YOUR DEATH</small>. The disciples asked R. Eliezer.<sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Shab. 153a (Sonc. ed., p. 781).</i> ‘Does, then, a man know on which day he will die that he should repent [the day before]?’ He replied, ‘All the more reason that he repent to-day lest he die tomorrow, or that he repent to-morrow lest he die the day after; as a consequence his whole life is spent in repentance’.<br>R. Jose b. Judah said in the name of R. Judah b. R. Ilai, who said it in the name of his father R. Ilai, who reported it in the name of R. Eliezer the Great: <small>REPENT ONE DAY BEFORE YOUR DEATH; WARM YOURSELF BEFORE THE FIRE OF THE SAGES, BUT BEWARE OF THEIR GLOWING COALS LEST YOU BE SCORCHED, FOR THEIR BITE IS THE BITE OF A FOX, AND THEIR STING IS THE STING OF A SCORPION; YEA ALL THEIR WORDS ARE LIKE COALS OF FIRE</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">From Aboth 2:15 (Sonc. ed., II, 10, pp. 20f).</i>

Chapter 16

R. J<small>OSHUA SAID: THE EVIL EYE, THE EVIL INCLINATION, AND THE HATRED OF MANKIND DRIVE A MAN OUT OF THE WORLD</small>.<br><small>THE EVIL EYE</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that as a man regards his own house, so he should regard the house of his fellow; and as a man would not wish an evil report spread about his wife and children, so he should not wish an evil report spread about his fellow’s wife and children.<br>Another interpretation. What is meant by <small>THE EVIL EYE</small>? It teaches that no man should begrudge the learning of his fellow. The story is told of a man who looked with a grudging eye upon his colleague’s learning that his life was cut short and he departed [prematurely from the world].
<small>THE EVIL INCLINATION</small>. What does this mean? It has been said that the evil inclination is senior to the good inclination by thirteen years,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The evil inclination, it was held, entered the human body even before birth, whereas the good inclination was acquired at the age of thirteen, the age of religious responsibility.</i> for it grows with and accompanies the child from the moment it comes forth from the mother’s womb. If the child begins to profane the Sabbath it<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the evil inclination the child has no sense of wrongdoing.</i> does not deter him; if he is about to take life it does not deter him; if he is about to commit an immoral act it does not deter him. After thirteen years, however, the good inclination is born in him. If then he is about to profane the Sabbath it<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. the good inclination.</i> warns him, ‘You fool! Scripture states, <i>Every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death</i>’.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 31, 14.</i> If he is about to take life, it warns him, ‘You fool! Scripture states, <i>Whoso sheddeth man’s blood, by man shall his blood be shed</i>’.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 9, 6.</i> If he is about to commit an immoral act, it warns him, ‘You fool! Scripture states, <i>Both the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death</i>’.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 20, 10.</i> When a man’s passions are stirred and he is about to commit an act of lewdness, all his limbs are ready to obey him, because the evil inclination is king over the two hundred and forty-eight limbs of man. On the other hand, when a man is about to perform an act of piety, all his limbs become sluggish,<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">The Heb. <i>mith‘annin</i> is unusual in this sense, but might be derived from the verb <i>‘innah</i>, ‘to delay’ (cf. <i>‘innuï haddin</i>, ‘the delay of justice’, Aboth 5:8). Schechter suggests the reading <i>mith‘aẓẓlin</i>, ‘are slothful’.</i> because the evil inclination which is within him bears sway over the two hundred and forty-eight limbs of his body, whereas the good inclination is like one who is confined in prison, as it is stated, <i>For out of prison he came forth to be king</i>,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 4, 14.</i> which verse has been interpreted as referring to the good inclination.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

In the morning the girl went and complained to her mistress, saying, ‘I would rather die than be given to that man!’ [The matron] sent for him and asked, ‘Why did you not treat this woman as men usually act?’ He replied, ‘What else could I do, seeing that I belong to the High-priestly line?

Or when he lays his hand on glowing coals and is burnt, this was caused by none other than the evil inclination which is within his body, since the evil inclination it is that drives him headlong [to destruction]. Observe, however, a kid or lamb: when it sees a well it turns back, since there is no evil inclination in a beast [to lead it into harm].<br>R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: I will explain it to you by a parable. To what is the evil inclination like? [25<i>a</i>] To a piece of iron which is cast into the fire.

When asked, ‘Who was with you [as an accomplice]?’ he could reply, ‘There was no one with me’; but he says to himself, ‘Since I am to be executed, let my fellow be executed along with me’. In the same way the evil inclination speaks, ‘Since I am doomed in the world to come, I will drag the entire body with me to destruction’.<br>R. Simeon b. Yoḥai said: By this reasoning Israel will never see Gehinnom. This may be explained by a parable. To what is the matter like? To a mortal king who had a field of poor quality. Certain men came and leased it at a rental of ten <i>kors</i> of wheat annually. They manured it, hoed it, watered it and weeded it; but they could only make it yield one <i>kor</i> of wheat during the year. The king asked them for an explanation and they replied, ‘Our sovereign lord! You know that the field which you leased to us originally yielded nothing to you; now after manuring it, weeding it and watering it, we made it yield us no more than one <i>kor</i> of wheat’. In like manner Israel will in the future plead with the Holy One, blessed be He, ‘Lord of the universe!

<small>AND THE HATRED OF MANKIND</small>. What does this mean? It teaches that a man should not adopt the rule: Love the Sages and hate the disciples, or Love the disciples and hate the <i>‘Am ha’areẓ</i>. Let his rule be: Love them all, and hate [only] heretics, apostates, seducers and informers. So said David, <i>Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate Thee?

Chapter 17

R. J<small>OSE SAID: LET THE PROPERTY OF YOUR FELLOW BE AS DEAR TO YOU AS YOUR OWN; FIT YOURSELF FOR THE STUDY OF THE TORAH, SINCE IT DOES NOT COME TO YOU BY INHERITANCE</small>.
What does this mean? It teaches that as a man regards his own property, so he should regard the property of his fellow; and as a man would not wish to see an evil report spread about his own property, so he should not wish to see an evil report spread about the property of his fellow.<br>Another interpretation of <small>LET THE PROPERTY OF YOUR FELLOW BE AS DEAR TO YOU AS YOUR OWN</small>. What does it mean? When a disciple comes to you and asks for instruction, if it is within your power to teach him, do so; but if not, dismiss him at once and take no money from him;<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">As remuneration for teaching; cf. Ned. 37a (Sonc. ed., p. 113) where the taking of a fee is prohibited.</i> as it is stated, <i>Say not unto thy neighbour: Go and come again, and to-morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 3, 28.</i>
<small>FIT YOURSELF FOR THE STUDY OF THE TORAH, SINCE IT DOES NOT COME TO YOU BY INHERITANCE</small>. Thus when Moses our teacher perceived that his sons had not the knowledge of the Torah to be able to succeed him in leadership, he wrapped himself in his robe and stood up to pray. He said, ‘Sovereign of the universe! Make known to me who will come in and go out at the head of this people, as it is stated, <i>And Moses spoke unto the Lord, saying: Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, who may go out before them, and who may come in before them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 27, 15-17.</i> Thereupon the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him, ‘Moses, <i>take thee Joshua</i>’.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 18.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, further said to Moses, ‘Go and appoint for him an interpreter<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Also called <i>’Amora</i>, ‘speaker’; he was the scholar who attended on the Rabbi during the lecture and expounded at length and in popular style the subject-matter given to him by the instructor.</i> that he may expound [the Torah] in your presence at the head of the notables of Israel’. At that time Moses said to Joshua, ‘Joshua, as for this people that I am delivering into your charge, they are not he-goats but kids; I am not delivering to you sheep but lambs, because as yet they have not occupied themselves with the commandments, and so have not reached the stage of he-goats;<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">And must be treated with care and consideration; cf.

Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sifre <i>ibid.</i> and Keth. 66b (Sonc. ed., p. 405).</i> was once walking in the market place when he observed a young woman picking grains of barley from under the feet of the cattle of the Arabs. He said to her, ‘My daughter, who are you?’ She remained silent. Again he asked her, ‘My daughter, who are you?’ She continued silent [for a time], and then said to him, ‘Wait a moment’. She wrapped herself in her hair, sat down before him and said, ‘I am the daughter of Naḳdimon b. Gorion’.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. above VI, 3, p. 47.</i> He asked, ‘My daughter, what became of your father’s wealth?’ She replied, ‘Master, is not the proverb current in Jerusalem, “The salt<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">A preservative. The difference in the two versions is in one letter, the former having <span dir="rtl">חסר</span> and the latter <span dir="rtl">חסד</span>.</i> of wealth is its diminution [by charitable use] (or, according to another version, “[The salt of wealth is] benevolence”)?’ ‘And what became of the wealth of your father-in-law?’ he asked. She replied, ‘The one swallowed up the other’.<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">The fortunes of the two men were interlocked.</i> Then Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai turned to his disciples and said, ‘All my life I have read the verse, <i>If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock</i>, but did not understand its significance until to-day when I have realized its meaning, viz. that Israel will come under the domination of the lowest of the nations, and not merely under the domination of the lowest of the nations but will be among the dung of their cattle’. The young woman then asked him, ‘Master, do you remember when you put your signature to my marriage contract?’ ‘I do,’ he replied; and turning to his disciples he said, ‘By the Temple Service! I signed this young woman’s marriage contract, and it mentioned a settlement of one million Tyrian golden dinars’. [It is related that] the members of the family to which the young woman belonged never set out from their house to go to the Temple until the finest woollen rugs were spread before them.
The story<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Further anecdotes of the wretched plight of even the wealthiest families in Israel during the siege of Jerusalem and after.</i> is told of a young woman who was taken captive together with her ten maids. A Gentile acquired her and she grew up in his house. One day he handed her a jug and said, ‘Go and fetch me some water’. One of her maids arose and took it from her. ‘What is this?’ he asked; and she replied, ‘By your life, master! I was one of five hundred maids of this young woman’s mother.’ When he heard these words, he at once set her free together with her ten maids.
Another story is told of a young woman who was taken captive. A Gentile acquired her and she grew up in his house. The Angel of Dreams<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘the master of the dream’; cf. Ber. 10b (Sonc. ed., p. 55, n. 5) where another explanation is suggested.</i> appeared to him and said, ‘Send the young woman from your house’. His wife said to him, ‘Do not send her away’. Again the Angel of Dreams appeared to him and said, ‘If you do not send her away I will kill you’, and he let her go. He followed her, saying [to himself], ‘I must go and see what will befall this young woman’. On her journey she became thirsty and went down to drink at a spring, When she placed her hand on the wall, a snake came and bit her so that she died, [her body] floating on the surface of the water. He went down, took her out and buried her. On his return home he remarked to his wife, ‘This people whom you behold bear the anger of none other than their Father in heaven’.

Chapter 18

Likewise<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This passage links up with the dictum in Aboth 2:11 (Sonc. ed., II, 8, p. 18) where Rabban Joḥanan b. Zakkai recounts the distinctive qualifications of his five foremost disciples.</i> R. Judah the Prince used to recount the praises of the following Sages: R. Ṭarfon, R. ‘Aḳiba, R. Eleazar b. Azariah, R. Joḥanan b. Nuri and R. Jose the Galilean.<br>R. Ṭarfon he described as a heap of stones (another version: a heap of nuts). When a man removes one, they all topple and fall over each other. So it was with R. Ṭarfon; whenever a disciple came to him and said, ‘Teach me’, he would produce for him [instruction in] Scripture, Mishnah, Midrash, <i>halakoth</i> and <i>’aggadoth</i>. When that disciple departed, he left laden with blessing and [intellectual] wealth.<br>R. ‘Aḳiba he described as a treasury with compartments.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">The translation follows the view of Rashi, given in Giṭ. 67a (Sonc. ed., p. 317), where he explains <span dir="rtl">בלום</span> as ‘divided into several compartments’. Jastrow, <i>s.v.</i> <span dir="rtl">בלם</span>, defines it ‘a packed treasury’ (of knowledge), but explains the variant, <span dir="rtl">בלוס</span> <i>(s.v.</i> <span dir="rtl">בלס</span>) as ‘a mind full of knowledge’. [Bacher, <i>Ag. d. pal. Amoräer</i>, II, p. 65, n. 6, gives <span dir="rtl">בלום</span> as the correct reading which he understands as ‘locked up’ or ‘packed’.]</i> To what may [25<i>b</i>] R. ‘Aḳiba be compared? To a pedlar who takes his sack and goes into a field. When he finds wheat he drops it in the sack; similarly when he finds barley, spelt, beans and lentils he drops them all in the sack. On returning home he sorts them all out, putting the wheat apart, the barley apart, the spelt, the beans, the lentils all apart. Such was the practice of R. ‘Aḳiba: he sorted all the Torah [he amassed] into its various compartments.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The text varies between <i>ṭaba‘oth</i>, ‘rings’ and <i>maṭbe‘oth</i>, ‘coins’. Rashi, <i>loc. cit.</i>, adopts the latter according to which the meaning is: As coins are put into a box according to their various denominations, so did R. ‘Aḳiba systematize the whole of the oral tradition. [Bacher, <i>Ag. d. Tannaiten</i> I, p. 267, n. 1, accepts the former reading, and explains that R. ‘Aḳiba sorted out the heterogeneous material and arranged it like ‘a chain of connected links’.]</i><br>R. Eleazar b. Azariah he described as a perfumer’s chest. To what may R. Eleazar be compared? To a perfumer who takes his chest with him and enters a city. The townsfolk come out and enquire, ‘Have you fine oil? Have you spikenard oil? Have you balsam oil?’ and find that he has everything [they require]. So it was with R. Eleazar b. Azariah. When a disciple came to him and enquired about Scripture he enlightened him, about Mishnah he enlightened him, about Midrash or <i>halakoth</i> or <i>’aggadoth</i> he enlightened him. When the disciple departed he left laden with [intellectual] wealth and blessing.
When R. Joshua was an old man, his disciples came to visit him.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Ḥag. 3a (Sonc. ed., pp. 8f).

Had you visited me only for the purpose of imparting this to me, it would have been sufficient’. They said to him, ‘He also gave this exposition: <i>The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails well fastened are the words of masters of assemblies:</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Eccl. 12, 11.

‘Aḳabya b. Mahalalel said: Whosoever takes four things to heart<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Aboth 3:1 (Sonc. ed., p. 26) where the more popular version reads: ‘Consider three things’, etc., omitting the third item, ‘what he is destined to become—dust, worms and maggots’ as being heterodox in outlook; cf. Finkelstein, <i>Akiba: Scholar, Saint and Martyr</i>, pp. 159f, where the maxim of ‘Aḳabya is described as ‘this unequivocal denial of personal immortality’. See also DER III, 1 (below, p. 543) where the saying is quoted as in the present text in the name of Ben ‘Azzai.</i> will never sin: whence he came, whither he is going, what he is destined to become, and who is his Judge. ‘Whence he came’—from a place of darkness; ‘whither he is going’—to a place of thick darkness; ‘what he is destined to become’—dust, worms and maggots; ‘and who is his Judge’—the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He.
R. Simeon said: Man came from a place of darkness and returns to a place of darkness. He came from a fetid drop, from a place which no eye can behold. And what is he destined to become? Dust, worms and maggots, as it is stated, <i>How much less man, that is a worm! and the son of man, that is a maggot!</i><sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Job 25, 6.</i> R.

And a maggot when dead? By reason of the creeping things which he generates when dead.
R. Simeon b. Eleazar said: I will illustrate it to you by a parable. To what can the matter be compared? To a king who built a large palace in which he resided,<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">According to a variant reading: ‘which he elaborately adorned’. GRA reads ‘magnificent in every detail’. V has ‘large palaces’.</i> but the waste-pipe of a tannery ran through it and emptied itself at the entrance.

Go forth and be mindful of the honour of your fellow-man, and when you pray know before Whom you are standing and praying. Then will you merit the life of the world to come’.<br>R. Eleazar said: Five things did we learn from R. Eliezer [on that day], and they afforded us greater pleasure than all that we had enjoyed from him in his lifetime, and they are as follows: If a round cushion, a ball, a shoemaker’s last, an amulet or a phylactery, about which you spoke to us, were torn, what would be the law?<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">The five articles enumerated have in common that they are made of leather and are permanently filled with stuffing. It is established law that an article of leather can contract defilement only if it is a receptacle, i.e. it has a cavity in which it can hold things. Since the articles here listed are <i>permanently</i> filled, the Sage held the view that they are not considered to be vessels with receptacles and consequently cannot be ritually defiled. R. Eliezer, however, was of the opinion that since the filling was removable, they were to be considered vessels with receptacles and could contract defilement. Furthermore, if any one of the enumerated articles were torn the opinion was unanimous that it could contract defilement, because some of the filling must have fallen out and in consequence a receptacle was formed. If, in the circumstances stated, the article became unclean, there was a further argument between R. Eliezer and the Sages whether it was necessary to remove <i>all</i> the filling before immersion took place. The Sages held the view that this must be done otherwise the immersion would be invalid, since the filling interposed between the vessel and the water. R. Eliezer, on the other hand, ruled that it could be immersed as it was without the removal of the filling. R. Eliezer here put forward his views as ancient traditional rulings. Cf. Kel. XXIII, 1 (Sonc. ed., p. 110).</i> The answer he gave was: They can contract uncleanness so be careful with them; and [if unclean] they may be immersed as they are. These laws are well established, for they were communicated to Moses on Mount Sinai.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">For textual variants of this passage, cf. below XXV 2 (p. 171), Sanh. 68a (Sonc. ed., pp. 462f) and DER III, end (below p. 544).</i>

He used to say: The words of the Torah are hard to acquire as vessels of gold, and are easily destroyed as glassware; as it is stated, <i>Gold and glass cannot equal it</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote">Job 28, 17.</i> A comparison is drawn between gold and glass: a golden vessel can be repaired when it is broken, but vessels of glass cannot be repaired when broken unless they are reduced to their original element.<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">i.e. melted by fire and then reshaped.</i> And how am I to interpret, <i>Neither shall the exchange thereof be vessels of fine gold?</i><sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i></i> It teaches that he who toils in [the words of the Torah] and fulfils them, his face shines like fine gold; but he who toils in them and does not fulfil them, his face is dark like glass.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The meaning is either opaque glass which is dull, or glass which quickly darkens.</i>
He used to say: A man may study the Torah for twenty years and forget it in two years. How can this be? If he sits idle for six months and does not revise his studies, he will in consequence pronounce the unclean to be clean and the clean to be unclean. [If he continues idle for] twelve months without revision, he will then confuse [the names of] the Sages;<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">Attributing a teaching to the wrong authority.</i> if for eighteen months without revision, he will forget the opening words of the chapters; and if twenty-four months without revision, he will forget even the titles [27<i>a</i>] of the Tractates.<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">This is the more logical order and is supported by MSS., cf. Schechter <i>ad loc.</i> V. reverses the order, putting ‘the titles of the Tractates’ before ‘the opening words of the chapters’.</i> And so, having pronounced the unclean to be clean and the clean to be unclean, having also confused [the names of] the Sages, and forgotten the chapter headings and even the titles of the Tractates, he will eventually sit in silence. Of him Solomon said, <i>I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding; and, lo, it was all grown over with thistles, the face thereof was covered with nettles, and the stone wall thereof was broken down</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 24, 30f.</i> When the wall of a vineyard collapses the entire vineyard is soon destroyed.

To a human king who caught a bird and gave it to one of his servants saying, ‘Be careful with the bird. If you guard it, well and good; but if not I will take your life for it’. So, too, did the Holy One, blessed be He, say to Israel, ‘I have entrusted the words of the Torah to you. If you guard them, well and good; but if not I will take your lives for them’.

The day when R. Eliezer fell ill was, according to tradition, the Sabbath-eve.

Be careful about these laws, because they are important laws which were communicated to Moses at Sinai’. They continued to question him on matters concerning cleanness and uncleanness and the regulations of ritual immersion. They said to him, ‘Master, what is the law in this case?’ and he answered, ‘It is unclean’. ‘And what is the law in that case?’ and he answered, ‘It is clean’. Throughout he pronounced the unclean to be unclean and the clean to be clean. After that R. Eliezer said to the Sages, ‘I am concerned about the disciples of the present generation lest they be punished with death at the hand of Heaven’. They asked him, ‘Master, what is the reason?’ He replied, ‘Because they did not come and attend upon me’.<sup class="footnote-marker">26</sup><i class="footnote">On account of the ban imposed upon him, the scholars had not sought his instruction.</i> He then said to ‘Aḳiba b. Joseph, ‘ ‘Aḳiba, why did you not come and attend upon me?’ He replied, ‘Master, I had no leisure’. He retorted, ‘I wonder whether you will die a natural death’. Some say that R. Eliezer did not make that rejoinder, but as R. Eliezer spoke to his disciples in this manner, R. ‘Aḳiba at once felt his blood melt within him and exclaimed, ‘Master, what will my death be?’ and he replied, ‘Yours will be the most cruel of all’.<br>R. ‘Aḳiba then approached, sat down before him and said, ‘Master teach me now’.

Chapter 27

R. J<small>OSE SAID: HE WHO HONOURS THE TORAH IS HIMSELF HONOURED BY MANKIND</small>, as it is stated, <i>For them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">1 Sam. 2, 30. ‘Me’ is here identified with the Torah, a doctrine frequent in the Zohar and other mystical literature.</i><br>Another interpretation<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Omitted in V, but inserted by GRA.</i> of <i>For them that honour Me I will honour:</i> this refers to Pharaoh king of Egypt who paid honour to Him Who spoke and the world came into being by going out at the head of his council of ministers. His servants said to him, ‘Usually kings go out behind their ministers, but you go out at their head!’ He replied, ‘Am I going out to meet a [28<i>a</i>] king of flesh and blood? No, I go to meet the Presence of the King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He’. Therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, paid Pharaoh honour, and He Himself meted out retribution to him, as it is stated, <i>I have compared thee, O my love, to a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Cant. 1, 9. This verse in no wise proves the point that God Himself inflicted punishment upon Pharaoh. GRA substitutes for this verse Hab. 3, 15, quoted in the preceding paragraph. This latter verse suggests that God set forth on His horses in order to requite Pharaoh; cf. Sanh. 94b (Sonc. ed., p. 634).</i>
R. Pappias said: The congregation of Israel praised the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, as it is stated, <i>Thou hast trodden the sea with Thy horses</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Hab. <i>ibid.</i> This verse too offers no proof for R. Pappias’ statement, and it has been suggested that Cant. 1, 9 should be read here as indicating the high esteem in which Pharaoh’s steeds were held, since God likens His love for Israel to a highly prized mare among Pharaoh’s chariots. The text of the passage is evidently in disorder and Schechter gives it up as hopeless. [Bacher, <i>Ag. d. Tannaiten</i> I, p. 319, n. 3, thinks that the appropriate quotation is Hab. 3, 8.]</i><br>R. Joshua b. Ḳorḥah said: When Pharaoh came to the Red Sea he was riding on a stallion, and the Holy One, blessed be He, appeared to him on a mare,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">To lure Pharaoh’s stallion to follow headlong into the sea; cf.

R. Simeon b.

He used to say: The words of the Torah are as difficult to acquire as fine woollen clothes, but are as easily lost as linen garments. Foolish and frivolous words are easily acquired, but are as hard to lose as a sack. Often a man buys a sack in the market for a <i>sela‘</i> and continues using it for four or five years.<br>R. Judah the Prince said: Whoever indulges in the pleasures of this world will be withheld from the pleasures of the world to come; but whoever denies himself the pleasures of this world will be granted the pleasures of the world to come.

To a chef who prepares a meal for himself; for though it cost him much effort, he prepares it for none other than himself; but to what can the wicked who are unfortunate in this world be compared?

Eleazar b. Shammua‘ said: There are three types of disciple: a cut stone, a corner-stone and a plinth. ‘A cut stone’—what does this describe? The disciple who has studied <i>Midrash</i><sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">Laws derived from the text of the Torah by exegesis.</i> only, so that whenever a scholar comes to consult him on a Midrashic subject he can enlighten him.

The disciple who has studied <i>Midrash</i> and <i>halakoth</i>, so that whenever a scholar comes to consult him either on a Midrashic or halakic subject he can enlighten him. Such a one is like a corner-stone which has two polished surfaces. ‘A plinth’—what does this describe? The disciple who has studied <i>Midrash, halakoth, ’aggadoth</i> and <i>tosephoth</i>, so that whenever a scholar comes to consult him on a subject in the <i>Midrash</i>, in the <i>halakoth</i>, in the <i>’aggadoth</i> or in the <i>tosephoth</i> he can enlighten him.

He used to say: Whoever is diligent in the study of Torah is afforded many opportunities for being diligent, and whoever is neglectful of the study of Torah is likewise afforded many causes for neglect; e.g. a lion, wolf, leopard, tiger, a snake or a band of troops or robbers will come and encircle him and inflict punishment upon him; as it is stated, <i>Verily there is a God that judgeth in the earth</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 58, 12.

Surely that of reward. And if with regard to the attribute of punishment, which is the lesser, it is held that he who transgressed in error is regarded by Scripture as if he had acted wantonly, how much more so is it with the attribute of reward, which is the greater!

R. Simeon said: Such is the penalty of a liar, that even when he speaks the truth he is not believed;<sup class="footnote-marker">20</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sanh. 89b (Sonc. ed., p. 596).

<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">This paragraph has no connection with the theme of this chapter, which is an extensive commentary on Aboth 5. Such commentary begins with §2.

Josiah said: He who buys grain in the market,<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Not having land of his own, he must resort to the market for grain for his household. This was considered a precarious existence; cf. Men. 103b (Sonc. ed., p. 637).</i> to what may he be compared?

To a man who digs his own grave.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘is dug and buried’. His is a wretched existence; cf. the statement in Men. <i>loc. cit.: ‘And shalt have no assurance of this life</i> (Deut. 28, 66): this refers to one who has to rely upon the bread dealer [for his daily needs]’ (Sonc. ed., p. 638).</i> But he who eats of his own produce is like a child reared at his mother’s breast.<br>He used to say: When a man eats of his own labour his mind is at ease. Even when he is dependent upon his father or mother or children, his mind is not at ease; and needless to say when he is dependent upon strangers.
<small>BY TEN SAYINGS WAS THE WORLD CREATED</small>. What need is there for mankind to [know] this? It is to teach that if a person performs one precept, or keeps one Sabbath, or saves one life, Scripture imputes it to him as though he had saved a whole world which was created by ten sayings.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The importance of the world is enhanced by the fact that God, in view of His omnipotence, took so much trouble with its creation, for instead of a single fiat He resorted to ten utterances to perfect the world.</i> And if a person commits one sin, or profanes one Sabbath, or destroys one life, Scripture imputes it to him as though he had destroyed a whole world which was created by ten sayings. We find it so with Cain who slew his brother Abel; as it is stated, <i>The voice of thy brother’s bloods crieth unto Me</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 4, 10, E.V., <i>brother’s blood</i>. The Heb. noun is plural.</i> He shed the blood of one person, yet Scripture speaks of many bloods! But it teaches you that the blood of his sons, of his sons’ sons and of his descendants to the end of all generations that were destined to issue from him, all stood and cried to the Holy One, blessed be He. Hence you learn that one man is equal in worth to the entire creation.<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sanh. IV, 5 (Sonc. ed., pp. 233f.).</i>
R. Nehemiah said: Whence do we know that one man is equal in worth to the entire creation? For it is stated, <i>This is the book of the generations of Adam</i>. [<i>In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made He him</i>];<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> V, 1.</i> and elsewhere it states, <i>These are the generations of the heaven and of the earth when they were created</i>, [<i>in the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> II, 4.</i> As in the one verse [which describes the creation of the world] the terms <i>created</i> and <i>made</i> are used, so in the other verse [which describes the creation of man] the terms <i>created</i> and <i>made</i> are used. This teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, showed Adam all the future generations that were to issue from him standing and sporting, as it were, before him. Some say that He showed him only the righteous [of every generation], as it is stated, <i>Every one that is written unto life in Jerusalem</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Is. 4, 3. The verse refers to the righteous, God’s elect, whose names are inscribed in the ‘Book of Life’, which is identical with <i>the book of the generations of Adam</i>.</i><br>R. Joshua b.

Eliezer the son of R.

Since, in fact, Moses received the Torah and he lived in the twenty-sixth generation from the creation, it follows that the Torah must have been in existence for nine hundred and seventy-four generations before the creation.

To a man who takes a piece of wood intending to engrave many designs on it; but as he has insufficient space for his designs, he is dejected.

Chapter 32

<small>THERE WERE TEN GENERATIONS FROM</small> A<small>DAM TO</small> N<small>OAH</small>. What need is there for mankind to [know] this? It is to teach you that although those generations provoked Him continually, the Holy One, blessed be He, did not bring the waters of the flood upon them on account of the righteous and pious who were among them. Some say that as long as Methuselah was alive the flood did not descend upon the earth; and even when Methuselah died the flood was yet suspended for them for seven days after his death, as it is stated, <i>And it came to pass after the seven days</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Gen. 7, 10.</i> What special feature was there about those seven days? They were the days of mourning for that righteous man which stayed the retribution; therefore it is stated, <i>And it came to pass after the seven days</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Cf. Sanh. 108b (Sonc. ed., p. 744).</i><br>Another interpretation of <i>And it came to pass after the seven days:</i> it teaches that the Holy One, blessed be He, granted them this further respite after the original period of one hundred and twenty years, in which time they might repent;<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">The verse in Gen. 6, 3, <i>Therefore shall his days be a hundred and twenty years</i>, is interpreted by the Rabbis as a period of warning which God granted to that generation in which to repent. When this ended, He allowed them a further seven days’ grace.</i> but they did not do so, therefore it is stated, <i>And it came to pass after the seven days</i>.<br>Another interpretation is: the words teach that the Holy One, blessed be He, reversed for them the order of the universe, the sun rising in the west and setting in the east, perchance they would notice it, be awestruck and repent; but they did not do so, therefore it is stated, <i>And it came to pass after the seven days</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote">The words <i>the seven days</i> recall the days of the creation and suggest that God interfered with the order of nature, as laid down at the creation, in the hope that mankind would be awestruck at the phenomenon and repent.</i><br>Another interpretation: The words teach that the Holy One, blessed be He, spread His table before them and showed them His bounty of the kind to be enjoyed in the world to come, so that they might scrutinize themselves and say, ‘Woe to us for all this good which we shall have lost!’ But they corrupted their way upon the earth,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">The text is in disorder and the translation follows Schechter’s text which gives the MS. reading. V reads ‘and [woe to us] for having destroyed our seed from the earth’.</i> as it is stated, <i>And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt;</i> [<i>for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth</i>].<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> VI, 12.</i>
R. Eleazar b. Parṭa said: It is written, <i>My spirit shall not judge man for ever</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> 3. The verb <i>yadon</i>, translated in the Versions as ‘abide’ or ‘contend’, is here given the meaning ‘judge’.</i> The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘I shall not judge them until I shall have first doubled their reward’,<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">This is in agreement with the Rabbinic doctrine (cf. Ḳid. 40b, Sonc. ed., p. 202) that God bestows prosperity upon the wicked in this world, paying them a double reward for the few good deeds to their credit in this world (cf. B.B. 15b, Sonc. ed., p. 75), in order to deny them the world to come.</i> as it is stated, <i>They spend their days in prosperity, and peacefully they go down to the grave</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Job 21, 13. Their reward is thus double: they live in prosperity and die in tranquillity without suffering; cf. Sanh. 108a (Sonc. ed., p. 739) where the verse is explained as referring to the generation of the flood.</i><br>R. Jose the Galilean said: Scripture states, <i>Shall not judge</i>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘I shall not regard the evil impulse as equal to the good impulse’. When is this so? Before the decree has been sealed; but once the decree has been sealed, both impulses bear equal responsibility for sin.<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">The intention of this passage is obscure. Perhaps the meaning is: because the evil impulse enters man at birth (Gen. 8, 21) and the nature of man is prone to fall under its sway (<i>ibid.</i> VI, 5), God will not judge it on the same footing as the good impulse, but make allowance for human frailty. Once man has been sentenced at the seat of judgment, both impulses are on equal footing as regards responsibility for sin. Cf. the somewhat similar statement by the same author in Midrash Rabbah, Genesis, XXVI, §6 (Sonc. ed., pp. 216f).</i>
He used to say: From the righteous the evil impulse is removed<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘he takes away from them’.</i> and they are left with<sup class="footnote-marker">12</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘and he gives them’.</i> the good impulse only, as it is stated, <i>My heart is slain within me</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">Ps. 109, 22, E.V., <i>is wounded. By heart</i> is meant the desires of the heart, i.e. the evil impulse. [According to Bacher, <i>Ag. d. Tannaiten</i>, I, p. 361, n. 3, the interpretation is based on the use of <i>leb</i> for <i>heart</i> instead of <i>lebab</i> both here and in the next quotation. The latter is explained by the Rabbis as the two impulses while the former denotes only one of them.]</i> From the wicked the good impulse is removed and they are left with the evil impulse only, as it is stated, <i>Transgression speaketh to the wicked, methinks—there is no fear of God before his eyes</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XXXVI, 2. <i>Transgression speaketh</i> is interpreted as ‘the evil impulse prompts’.</i> Average people are left with both impulses: he who draws near to the evil impulse is swayed by it, and he who draws near to the good impulse is swayed by it, as it is stated, <i>Because He standeth at the right hand of the needy, to save him from them that judge his soul</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> CIX, 31. The <i>needy</i> are the average persons who are lacking in good deeds. <i>Them that judge his soul</i> are the two impulses in man which control him. On the passage, cf.

The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘I will not judge them until I have rewarded the righteous’. This is so only in this world;<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">The punishment of the wicked will be the more poignant when they see the bliss of the righteous. This, however, can only happen in this world and not in the world to come, because the generation of the flood will not stand in the judgment in the world to come; cf.

Consequently the wicked will not see anything of the reward granted to the righteous in the hereafter.</i><br>R. ‘Aḳiba said: Scripture states, <i>My spirit shall not judge man for ever</i>. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘They did not scrutinize themselves as mortals,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">According to this interpretation the subject of <i>yadon</i>, here understood as ‘they did not judge themselves’ is the generation of the flood.</i> but displayed an arrogant spirit towards the Most High’, [as it is stated,] <i>Yet they said unto God: Depart from us</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">19</sup><i class="footnote">Job 21, 14.</i><br>R.

But when Israel perform the will of the All-present, the heathen nations have no power over them [and are harmless] like the boar of the river: as the boar of the river neither kills persons nor injures human beings, so when Israel perform His will no nation or tongue can kill, attack or injure them.

Chapter 35

<small>TEN MIRACLES WERE WROUGHT FOR OUR FATHERS IN JERUSALEM:</small><sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The current editions read ‘in the Temple’. This is an error, because the list of miracles wrought in the Temple is given later in the chapter, §5, and the name ‘Jerusalem’ is specified in the last eight items. It would seem that the first two were common to the Temple and Jerusalem. Cf. Aboth 5:8 (Sonc. ed., V, 5, pp. 61f). Furthermore, in the current editions the first two items are followed by, ‘Ten miracles were wrought for our fathers in Jerusalem’. It is suggested that these words were a marginal correction for the opening line of the chapter, intended to replace it, but by mistake it was inserted in the text in addition to the opening line. Cf. Schechter’s note in his ed.</i> <small>THE HALLOWED FLESH NEVER TURNED PUTRID; NO WOMAN MISCARRIED THROUGH THE SMELL OF THE HALLOWED FLESH</small>; no man was ever injured in Jerusalem, no man was ever attacked in Jerusalem; no man ever stumbled in Jerusalem; never did fire break out in Jerusalem; never did a building collapse in Jerusalem; no man ever said to his fellow, ‘I cannot find an oven in which to roast the Passover-offering in Jerusalem’; no man ever said to his fellow, ‘I cannot find a bed to sleep on in Jerusalem’; <small>AND NO MAN EVER SAID TO HIS FELLOW</small>, ‘<small>THE PLACE IS TOO STRAIT FOR ME TO LODGE OVERNIGHT IN JERUSALEM</small>’.

When Israel went up to prostrate themselves before their Father in heaven, although they sat so closely pressed together that none could insert a finger between them, yet when they prostrated themselves they found ample space to do so. The greatest miracle of all was that even when a hundred people were bowing all at the same time, the superintendent of the assembly never found it necessary to call out, ‘Make room for your brethren’. Miracles were wrought also in the Temple court; for even if all Israel entered there, the Temple court accommodated them all. The greatest miracle of all was that when Israel stood in prayer so closely pressed together that none could insert a finger between them, yet when they prostrated themselves there was the space of a man’s height between them.<sup class="footnote-marker">41</sup><i class="footnote">The several sentences in this passage are apparently different versions of the same tradition.</i>

Chapter 36

The men of Sodom will neither come to life [in the hereafter] nor be brought to judgment,<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">The eschatological doctrines assumed here are that some time in the future, after the Messianic era, the dead will come to life again.

It would seem that all, the wicked as well as the righteous, will be resurrected, with the exception only of the very wicked who, as enumerated here, will not come back to life and consequently will not stand in judgment. For a comprehensive study of this subject, cf. the chapters on ‘The Hereafter’ in G. F. Moore, <i>Judaism</i>, II, Part VII and A. Cohen, <i>Everyman’s Talmud</i>, chap. XI.

<small>SEVEN KINDS OF PUNISHMENT COME UPON THE WORLD FOR SEVEN CARDINAL TRANSGRESSIONS. IF SOME GIVE THEIR TITHES AND OTHERS DO NOT, THERE COMES A FAMINE THROUGH DROUGHT</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">1</sup><i class="footnote">Aboth 5:11 (Sonc. ed., V, 8, p. 65) adds: ‘then some suffer hunger while others have plenty’; retribution on the principle ‘measure for measure’.</i> If some offer the heave-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">2</sup><i class="footnote">Num. 18, 8ff.</i> and others do not, there comes a famine through tumult.<sup class="footnote-marker">3</sup><i class="footnote">Of war.</i> If some set apart the dough-offering<sup class="footnote-marker">4</sup><i class="footnote"><i>Ibid</i>. XV, 20f.</i> and others do not, there comes a famine of extermination. If all resolved not to give their tithes, they thereby caused the heavens to close from sending down dew or rain, and men toil but have no sufficiency. R. Josiah said: For the sin of [withholding] the dough-offering no blessing enters into the fruit; and men toil but have no sufficiency. For the sin of [withholding] the heave-offering and the tithes, the heavens are closed from sending down dew or rain; and the people are delivered into the hand of their enemies.
Pestilence comes upon the world for the sin of [withholding from the poor] the gleanings,<sup class="footnote-marker">5</sup><i class="footnote">Lev. 19, 9f, XXIII, 22.</i> the forgotten sheaf,<sup class="footnote-marker">6</sup><i class="footnote">Deut. 24, 19-21.</i> the corner of the field, and the poor-tithe.<sup class="footnote-marker">7</sup><i class="footnote"><i>ibid.</i> XIV, 28f.

Their mother said, ‘When will my sons return from the field? Perhaps they will bring home<sup class="footnote-marker">8</sup><i class="footnote">lit. ‘I will find in their hand’</i> something to eat’. The sons said, ‘When can we return to our mother? Perhaps she will have with her something to eat’. She found nothing with them and they found nothing with her to eat. They put their heads between the knees of their mother and all three died in one day. The Holy One, blessed be He, said, ‘You have taken their lives; as surely as you live, I will exact your lives from you’. For it is stated, <i>Rob not the weak, because he is weak, neither crush the poor in the gate; for the Lord will plead their cause, and despoil of life those that despoil them</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">9</sup><i class="footnote">Prov. 22, 22f.</i>
<small>THE SWORD COMES UPON THE WORLD FOR THE DELAY OF JUSTICE</small>,<sup class="footnote-marker">10</sup><i class="footnote">This term includes <i>inter alia</i> the unnecessary delay caused by the Rabbi or judge in giving his decision on a question of religious law.

Elisha, the High Priest,] and led them to execution,<sup class="footnote-marker">11</sup><i class="footnote">These Rabbis were two of the ‘Ten Royal Martyrs’ who were executed by the Romans at various times for their insistence on teaching the Torah in spite of the interdict. [Bacher, <i>Ag. d. Tannaiten</i> I, p. 234, n. 3, holds that this martyr, Simon, was not Rabban Simeon b.

Cf. Büchler, <i>Studies in Sin and Atonement</i>, pp. 195ff.</i> and said, ‘Woe to us that we are to be put to death like desecrators of the Sabbath, or idolaters, or immoral persons, or murderers’. R. Ishmael b. Elisha said to him, ‘May I say a word to you?’ He said, ‘Speak’; and R. Ishmael said,<sup class="footnote-marker">13</sup><i class="footnote">There is an obvious gap here. In the parallel passages, Mekilta, <i>Mishpaṭim, Neziḳin</i> XVIII, Semaḥoth VIII, below p. 365, and II ARN XLI, R. Ishmael suggests that his sad fate might be attributed to his having delayed justice. It is on this score that the story finds its place here. The passage to be inserted reads: ‘Did a woman ever come to you to ask about her monthly impurity, or a man about his vow, and they were kept waiting, because you were asleep or having a meal, or perhaps you had no free time, or perhaps the attendant would not allow them to enter?’</i> ‘Perhaps when you were sitting down to a meal, poor persons came and stood at your door, and you did not allow them to enter and eat with you’. Rabban Simeon replied, ‘I swear by Heaven that I never did so; but I set watchers who sat at the door, and when poor persons came they brought them to me and they ate and drank with me, and blessed Heaven’s name’. Then R. Ishmael said, ‘Perhaps when you were sitting and expounding [the Torah] on the Temple mount, and all the multitudes of Israel were sitting before you, your mind was puffed up’. Rabban Simeon answered, ‘Ishmael, my brother, a man must be prepared to accept his fate’.<sup class="footnote-marker">14</sup><i class="footnote">The reason suggested—his elation and pride at the sight of men standing and listening to his teaching—apparently accounted for his fate, and Rabban Simeon acknowledged God’s justice.</i> They both pleaded with the executioner; one said, ‘I am a priest, son of a High Priest; put me to death first so that I do not witness the death of my colleague’. The other said, ‘I am a prince, the son of a prince; put me to death first so that I do not witness the death of my colleague’. The executioner said, ‘Draw lots’. They did so, and the lot fell upon Rabban Simeon b. Gamaliel. The executioner took the sword and cut off his head. R. Ishmael b. Elisha took it up, held it to his bosom, wept and exclaimed, ‘Holy mouth, faithful mouth! Holy mouth, faithful mouth! Mouth that gave forth beautiful gems, precious stones and pearls! Who has buried you in the dust and filled your tongue with dust and ashes? Concerning you was it stated, <i>Awake, O sword, against My shepherd, and against the man that is near unto Me’</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">15</sup><i class="footnote">Zech. 13, 7.</i> He had not yet finished his words when they took the sword and cut off his head. Of them Scripture states, <i>My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">16</sup><i class="footnote">Ex. 22, 23. This verse describes the punishment imposed for delaying the rights of widows and orphans.</i><br><sup class="footnote-marker">17</sup><i class="footnote">This passage is only introduced here incidentally, quoting the full exposition of the verse cited from Ex. 100f. Mekilta <i>loc. cit.</i>, and B.M. 38b (Sonc. ed., p. 232), also Rashi on the verse.</i>From the simple meaning of the words, <i>And I will kill you with the sword</i>, do I not know that the wives will be widows and the children orphans? It signifies that they will be ‘widows and not widows’, as when there are no witnesses forthcoming [to testify to the death of their husbands] to permit them to remarry; as [happened at the destruction of] Bethar,<sup class="footnote-marker">18</sup><i class="footnote">The scene of the last stand of the Jews under Bar Kochba against the Romans in 135 <small>C.E.</small></i> where not a single person escaped [to testify to the death of any individual] to permit the wives to remarry. Similarly, from the simple meaning of the words, <i>And your wives shall be widows</i>, I know that the children will be orphans. It signifies that they will be ‘orphans and not orphans’; for their property will remain in the presumed ownership of their fathers, and the children will not be permitted either to inherit the property or to transact any business with it.

There are four acts that a man performs, the fruits of which he enjoys in this world, while the capital is laid up for him in the world to come.

One sits in silence and receives a reward, another sits in silence and receives no reward.

<small>THERE ARE FOUR TYPES AMONG THOSE THAT SIT BEFORE THE SAGES: ONE IS LIKE A SPONGE, ANOTHER LIKE A SIFTER, A THIRD LIKE A FUNNEL, AND A FOURTH LIKE A STRAINER</small>.<sup class="footnote-marker">28</sup><i class="footnote">Cf.

It describes the intelligent disciple who sits before the Sages and learns Scripture, Mishnah, Midrash, <i>halakoth</i> and <i>’aggadoth:</i> as a sifter lets out the bran and retains the fine flour, so he lets the worthless go and retains the good.<sup class="footnote-marker">30</sup><i class="footnote">The Heb. <i>ḳemaḥ</i> here denotes the superfine dust which is of useless quality (Maimonides). According to Taylor, quoted by J. H.

It describes the stupid student who sits before the Sages and hears Scripture, Mishnah, [Midrash], <i>halakoth</i> and <i>’aggadoth:</i> as the funnel takes in at one end and lets out at the other, so is he: whatever is imparted to him goes in through one ear and out through the other, and what comes in first slips out first. ‘Like a strainer’—what is meant by this? It describes the wicked student who sits before a Sage and hears Scripture, Mishnah, Midrash, <i>halakoth</i> and <i>’aggadoth:</i> as the strainer lets the wine out and retains the lees, so he lets the good out and retains the bad. R. Eliezer b. Jacob describes him as a horn, perforated and <i>ḳiṭṭu‘ah</i>.<sup class="footnote-marker">31</sup><i class="footnote">The text as well as the meaning is dubious. To what does ‘him’ refer? Perhaps to the last type mentioned, the wicked student. According to R. Eliezer he is not so much wicked as deficient in discrimination. He describes him as a horn which is perforated at its sharp end, thereby allowing what enters to run out. Moreover, his mind is defective (<span dir="rtl">קיטועה</span> from the root <span dir="rtl">קטע</span>, ‘to mutilate’) and he can retain only what comes last, like the child who keeps only what he receives last and has not the sense to appraise relative values.</i> What is <i>ḳiṭṭu‘ah?</i> It is like the conduct of a child who has been given a pearl; when offered some bread, he throws the pearl away and takes the bread; then when offered an earthenware vessel he throws the bread away and takes the vessel, so that ultimately he has nothing but an earthenware vessel in his hand.
As regards disciples Rabban Gamaliel the Elder discerned four types: the unclean fish, the clean fish, the Jordan fish and the Great Sea fish. ‘The unclean fish’—what is meant by this?

Simeon realized that he had done wrong, he dismounted from the ass, prostrated himself before the man and said, ‘I apologize to you, forgive me’. But the man answered, ‘I will not forgive you until you say to the Craftsman Who made me, “How ugly is the vessel which Thou hast made!” ’ R. Simeon ran after him for three miles [until he reached his town]. When the people of the town came out to meet him, greeting him with the words, ‘Peace be unto you, Master’, the man asked them, ‘Whom do you address as Master?’ They replied, ‘Him who follows you’. He said to them, ‘If this man is a master, may there not be many like him in Israel!’ ‘Heaven forbid!’ they exclaimed; ‘what did he do to you?’ He answered, ‘This is how he behaved towards me’. They said to him, ‘Nevertheless, forgive him’. The man replied, ‘I will forgive him, but on condition that he will never again act in this manner’. That same day R. Simeon entered his great House of Study and lectured: At all times a man should be pliant as a reed and not hard like a cedar. Now what is the feature of the reed?
