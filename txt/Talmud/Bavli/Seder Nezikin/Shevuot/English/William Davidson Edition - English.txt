Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>oaths</b> on an utterance of the lips, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four</b> types. The Torah specifies only two types of oaths whose violation renders one liable to bring a sliding-scale offering to atone for his transgression (see Leviticus 5:4): Where a person takes an oath to perform some action, and where he takes an oath to refrain from performing some action. With regard to both types, the Torah explicitly mentions liability only for an oath pertaining to one’s future behavior. Nevertheless, the Sages derive that one is also liable for a violation of both types of oaths when they pertain to one’s past behavior. Accordingly, although only two types are explicitly mentioned in the Torah, the Sages derive that there are actually four types.
The mishna lists similar groups of <i>halakhot</i>. With regard to cases of <b>awareness of the defiling</b> of the Temple by entering it while one is ritually impure, or defiling its sacrificial foods by partaking of them while one is ritually impure, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> It is prohibited for an impure person to enter the Temple (see Numbers 19:20) or to partake of its sacrificial foods (see Leviticus 7:19–20). If one transgressed either prohibition during a lapse of awareness, then upon becoming aware of his transgression, he is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering (see Leviticus 5:2). The Torah specifies that one is liable to bring the offering only in the case in which he had a lapse of awareness of the fact that he was impure. The Sages derive that one is liable not only in these two cases, but also where he was aware of his personal status but had a lapse of awareness concerning the identity of the place he was entering or the status of the foods he ate.
With regard to acts of <b>carrying out</b> that are prohibited <b>on Shabbat,</b> there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> On Shabbat, it is prohibited to transfer an item from domain to domain. The Torah explicitly refers to only two cases, both of which involve an item being transferred from a private domain to a public domain: Where the transfer is made by a person who remains in the public domain, and where the transfer is made by a person who remains in the private domain. The Sages derive that liability is incurred in these cases also if the item is transferred from the public domain to the private domain. Although only two types are mentioned by the Torah, the Sages derive that there are actually four types.
With regard to <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks</b> on a person’s skin, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> The Torah specifies that if a leprous mark appears on a person’s skin, the afflicted person must undergo a process of purification and then bring various offerings. Part of the classification of these types of leprosy is based on their shade of white. Two types of marks are explicitly mentioned in the Torah, and the Sages derive that each of these two types has a secondary mark.
The mishna returns to the subject of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods. It elaborates on which offerings atone for different cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods: In cases <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness,</b> i.e., he knew he was ritually impure and was aware of the sanctity of the Temple or foods involved <b>at the beginning,</b> i.e., before he transgressed, <b>and</b> had <b>awareness at the end,</b> i.e., after the transgression, <b>but</b> had <b>a lapse of awareness</b> of one of those two components <b>in between,</b> while he actually transgressed, <b>this</b> person is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sliding-scale</b> offering.
For cases <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning,</b> transgressed during a lapse of awareness, <b>and</b> still <b>had no awareness at the end,</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur, <b>and Yom Kippur</b> itself, <b>suspend</b> any punishment that he deserves <b>until he becomes aware</b> of his transgression; <b>and</b> then to achieve atonement <b>he brings a sliding-scale</b> offering.
For cases in which one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but had awareness at the end,</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed outside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., the goat of the additional offerings of Yom Kippur, <b>and Yom Kippur</b> itself, <b>atone, as it is stated</b> with regard to the offerings brought on Yom Kippur: “One goat for a sin-offering <b>aside from the sin-offering of the atonements”</b> (Numbers 29:11). The verse juxtaposes the internal and external goats together to teach that <b>for that which this</b> one <b>atones, that</b> one <b>atones. Just as the internal</b> goat, i.e., the one whose blood presentation is performed inside the Sanctuary, <b>atones only for a case in which there was awareness</b> of the components of the transgression at some point, i.e., at the beginning, <b>so too, the external</b> goat, i.e., the goat of the additional offerings of Yom Kippur, <b>atones only for a case in which there was awareness</b> at some point, i.e., at the end.
<b>And for</b> cases in <b>which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end,</b> the <b>goats</b> brought as sin-offerings for the additional offerings <b>of the Festivals and</b> the <b>goats</b> brought as sin-offerings for the additional offerings <b>of</b> the <b>New Moons atone.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The <b>goats of the Festivals atone</b> for cases in which one never had awareness of the transgression, <b>but</b> the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons</b> do <b>not. But</b> if so, <b>for what do</b> the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone?</b>

Daf 2b

They atone <b>for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who</b> unwittingly <b>partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food.
<b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> With regard to <b>all the goats</b> offered as additional offerings, those of the New Moons, Festivals, and Yom Kippur, <b>their atonement,</b> i.e., the atonement that they effect, <b>is the same;</b> they all atone <b>for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple</b> by entering it while impure, <b>or</b> for the defiling of <b>its sacrificial</b> foods by partaking of them while impure.
<b>Rabbi Shimon would say,</b> delineating his opinion as the mishna expresses it above: The <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who</b> unwittingly <b>partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food. <b>And</b> with regard to the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals atone for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end, and</b> the goats of the additional offerings <b>of Yom Kippur atone for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end.</b>
The Rabbis <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>whether</b> goats consecrated for different days <b>may be sacrificed, this</b> one <b>in</b> place of <b>that</b> one? For example, if a goat was initially consecrated to be sacrificed as part of the Yom Kippur additional offerings, may it be sacrificed as part of the Festival additional offerings instead? Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: They may be sacrificed. They said to him: Since,</b> according to you, <b>their atonement is not the same, how could they</b> possibly <b>be sacrificed, this</b> one <b>in</b> place of <b>that</b> one? Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them:</b> They can be interchanged, since ultimately <b>all of them come to atone for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods.
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of</b> Rabbi Shimon a tradition of his opinion that differs from the way the mishna expresses it above: The <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who</b> unwittingly <b>partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food. The goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals exceed them, as they atone</b> both <b>for a pure</b> person <b>who partook of impure</b> sacrificial food <b>and</b> also <b>for</b> cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end.</b>
The goats <b>of Yom Kippur</b> further <b>exceed them, as they atone</b> both <b>for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food <b>and for</b> cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end; and</b> they also atone <b>for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end.</b>
The Rabbis <b>said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>whether</b> goats consecrated for different days <b>may be sacrificed, this</b> one <b>in</b> place of <b>that</b> one? Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them: Yes,</b> they can be interchanged. <b>They said to him: If</b> what you say is <b>so,</b> granted that the goats <b>of Yom Kippur may be sacrificed on</b> the <b>New Moons, but how could</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>New Moons be sacrificed on Yom Kippur</b> when they will need <b>to effect atonement</b> for <b>that which they were not</b> consecrated <b>for?</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them:</b> They can all be interchanged, since ultimately <b>all of them come to atone for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, even if each one atones for a different case.
§ <b>And for</b> the <b>intentional defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, both the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur, <b>and Yom Kippur</b> itself, <b>atone.</b>
The mishna delineates how atonement is effected for other transgressions: <b>For</b> all <b>other transgressions that are</b> stated <b>in the Torah,</b> whether they are <b>the minor</b> ones <b>or the major</b> ones, whether they were <b>intentional or unwitting,</b> whether <b>one became aware</b> of them before Yom Kippur <b>or did not become aware</b> of them until after Yom Kippur, whether they involve <b>a positive mitzva or a prohibition,</b> whether the transgressors are subject to <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>] or</b> to one of the <b>court</b>-imposed <b>death penalties,</b> the <b>scapegoat</b> sent to Azazel on Yom Kippur <b>atones.</b>
<b>Israelites and priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, achieve atonement from the scapegoat equally. <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between Israelites, priests, and</b> the <b>anointed priest?</b> The difference is <b>only that the priests achieve atonement for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods through <b>the bull</b> that the High Priest offers on Yom Kippur, whereas the Israelites achieve atonement for defiling caused by them through the goats that are sacrificed on Yom Kippur.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> With regard to the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, <b>just as</b> the <b>blood of the goat, whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>atones for Israelites, so</b> too, the <b>blood of the bull</b> of the High Priest, whose blood presentation is also performed inside the Sanctuary, <b>atones for the priests.</b> And for all other transgressions, <b>just as</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over the scapegoat atones for Israelites, so</b> too, the <b>confession</b> made <b>over</b> the <b>bull atones for the priests.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara inquires: <b>Now, the <i>tanna</i> is leaving</b> tractate <b><i>Makkot</i>,</b> the tractate that precedes tractate <i>Shevuot</i> in the mishnaic order. <b>What is distinctive</b> about tractate <i>Shevuot</i> <b>that he teaches</b> tractate <b><i>Shevuot</i></b> after tractate <i>Makkot</i>? The Gemara answers: It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he teaches</b> in a mishna at the end of tractate <i>Makkot</i> (20a): <b>For</b> rounding the edges of his <b>head</b> one is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> sets of lashes: <b>One from here,</b> the hair adjacent to one ear, <b>and one from there,</b> the hair adjacent to the other ear.

Daf 3a

<b>And for</b> marring <b>the</b> edges of his <b>beard</b> there are <b>two</b> edges <b>from here,</b> on one side of his face, <b>and two from there,</b> on the other side, <b>and one from below.</b>
The Gemara explains: As apparent from the mishna in <i>Makkot</i>, this is a case where there is <b>one</b> prohibition <b>for which one is liable</b> to receive <b>two</b> punishments. Continuing on this theme, the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in the beginning of tractate <i>Shevuot</i> examples of other sets of <i>halakhot</i> that can be formulated similarly, beginning with: With regard to <b>oaths</b> on an utterance, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four</b> types.
The Gemara inquires: <b>What is different here,</b> in tractate <i>Shevuot</i>, <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches all</b> the sets of <i>halakhot</i> that can be formulated as: Two that are four, <b>and what is different with regard to</b> the chapter beginning: The acts of <b>carrying out</b> that are prohibited <b>on Shabbat,</b> i.e., the first chapter of tractate <i>Shabbat</i>, <b>and</b> the chapter beginning: <b>And</b> the <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks,</b> i.e., the first chapter of tractate <i>Nega’im</i>, <b>where</b> the mishna <b>does not teach all of them,</b> rather only the specific set of <i>halakhot</i> relevant to that tractate?
The Sages <b>say</b> in explanation: Since the passages of <b>oaths and</b> of liability based on one’s <b>awareness of the defiling</b> of the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>are written together</b> in the Torah (see Leviticus 5:2–4), <b>and they are</b> also <b>similar to each other</b> in that they can both incur liability <b>to</b> bring <b>a sliding-scale offering,</b> the mishna therefore <b>taught</b> both of <b>them together</b> here. <b>And once it</b> already <b>taught two</b> sets, it continued and <b>taught all of them.</b>
The Gemara inquires further: Tractate <i>Shevuot</i> <b>opens with</b> a reference to <b>oaths, but</b> then proceeds to <b>explain</b> the cases of one’s <b>awareness of the defiling</b> of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, returning to discuss oaths only in the third chapter. Why? The Gemara explains: <b>Since</b> the <b>cases</b> of one’s awareness of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>are</b> relatively <b>few,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>addressed</b> them <b>directly</b> and <b>dispensed with them, and then</b> afterward returned to <b>teach</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>oaths, which have numerous details.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>oaths</b> on an utterance, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four</b> types. The Gemara explains: The <b>two</b> types are where one states: On my oath <b>I will eat, and</b> where he states: On my oath <b>I will not eat.</b> If he violates either oath he is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering. These two types <b>are</b> actually <b>four</b> types because they also include the cases where a person falsely states: On my oath <b>I ate, and</b> where he falsely states: On my oath <b>I did not eat.</b>
The mishna continues: With regard to cases of one’s <b>awareness of the defiling</b> of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, for which one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering, there are <b>two</b> cases <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> The Gemara explains: The <b>two</b> cases are where one’s lack of <b>awareness of</b> the fact that he was <b>ritually impure</b> led him to eat <b>sacrificial</b> food, <b>and</b> where one’s lack of <b>awareness</b> of the fact that he was <b>ritually impure</b> led him to enter the <b>Temple.</b> These two types <b>are</b> actually <b>four</b> types, because one is also liable where he was aware that he was impure, but had a lapse of awareness about the status of the <b>sacrificial</b> food <b>or</b> the identity of the <b>Temple.</b>
The mishna continues: With regard to acts of <b>carrying out</b> that are prohibited <b>on Shabbat,</b> there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are four.</b> The Gemara explains the cases by using the analogy of a poor person who remains in the public domain and a homeowner who remains in the private domain and one passes an item to the other: The <b>two</b> types are the <b>carrying out by a poor person</b> of an item from the private domain to the public domain <b>and</b> the <b>carrying out by a homeowner</b> of an item from the private domain to the public domain. These two types <b>are</b> actually <b>four</b> types because they also include the <b>bringing in by a poor person</b> of an item from the public domain to the private domain <b>and</b> the <b>bringing in by a homeowner</b> of an item from the public domain to the private domain.
The mishna’s final example: With regard to <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks,</b> there are <b>two</b> shades <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> The Gemara explains: The <b>two</b> shades are of <b>a wool-white</b> leprous <b>mark [<i>se’et</i>] and</b> of <b>a snow-white</b> leprous <b>mark [<i>baheret</i>].</b> These two <b>are</b> actually <b>four</b> because they also include <b>a <i>se’et</i> and its secondary</b> mark, i.e., one similar to it, and <b>a <i>baheret</i> and its secondary</b> mark, i.e., one similar to it.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna?</b> It is <b>neither</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael nor</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>If</b> one suggests that it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> that suggestion can be refuted, as <b>doesn’t he say</b> with regard to oaths: <b>One is liable only for</b> oaths pertaining to <b>the future,</b> but not for those pertaining to the past? The mishna states that one is liable also for oaths pertaining to the past. And <b>if</b> one suggests it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> that suggestion can be refuted, as <b>doesn’t he say: For</b> having defiled the Temple or its sacrificial foods during <b>a lapse of awareness of</b> the fact that one is <b>ritually impure</b> one <b>is liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering, <b>but</b> one <b>is not liable for</b> having done so during <b>a lapse of awareness of</b> the fact that the place he entered was actually the <b>Temple?</b> The mishna states that one is liable also in such a case.
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> and <b>if you wish, say</b> that the mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> and the intent of the mishna is that while there are four types of oaths, <b>among them</b> are types <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability</b> to bring an offering for one who violates them <b>and among them</b> are types <b>for</b> which there is <b>exemption</b> from liability for one who violates them. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> and the intent of the mishna is that while there are four cases defined by one’s awareness of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, <b>among them</b> are cases <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability</b> to bring an offering <b>and among them</b> are cases <b>for</b> which there is <b>exemption</b> from liability.
The Gemara asks: How can one say that the mishna teaches types <b>for</b> which there is <b>exemption</b> from liability?

Daf 3b

<b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> these cases <b>similar to</b> the different <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks,</b> which indicates that <b>just as there, all</b> four <b>of them</b> are shades <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability</b> to bring an offering, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to oaths and the cases of one’s awareness of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, <b>all</b> four <b>of them</b> are cases <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability</b> to bring an offering.
The Gemara suggests a different resolution: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael. And while Rabbi Yishmael does not deem one liable for</b> oaths <b>pertaining to the past,</b> that is only with regard to liability to bring <b>an offering; but he does deem one liable</b> to be administered <b>lashes.</b>
<b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rava, as Rava says: The Torah explicitly amplifies</b> the prohibition of taking <b>a false oath</b> to be <b>similar to</b> the prohibition of <b>an oath taken in vain,</b> to teach that one is flogged for its violation. It follows that <b>just as</b> an oath taken in <b>vain pertains to the past</b> and renders one liable to receive lashes, <b>so too,</b> taking <b>a false</b> oath that <b>pertains to the past</b> renders one liable to receive lashes.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted</b> that one who stated: On my oath <b>I ate,</b> but in fact he did not eat, <b>or</b> one who stated: On my oath <b>I did not eat,</b> but in fact he ate, is liable to receive lashes, as this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rava.</b> And <b>also</b> if one stated: On my oath <b>I will not eat, and he ate</b> in violation of his oath, he is liable to receive lashes, as it <b>is a prohibition that involves an action,</b> and, in general, such prohibitions are punishable by flogging. <b>But</b> if one stated: On my oath <b>I will eat, and</b> in violation of his oath <b>he did not eat, why</b> should he be liable to receive lashes? It <b>is a prohibition that does not involve an action.</b> The generally accepted principle is that one is not liable to receive lashes for violating a prohibition without performing an action.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> disagrees with the generally accepted principle and <b>holds</b> that <b>one is flogged for</b> the violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> then <b>a difficulty</b> arises between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>
<b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is always <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling of <b>an unattributed mishna.</b> Since the mishna here is unattributed and assumes that one is flogged for taking a false oath, Rabbi Yoḥanan should rule that this is the <i>halakha</i>.
<b>And</b> an amoraic dispute <b>was stated</b> with regard to one who said: On my <b>oath I will eat this loaf today, and the day passed and he did not eat it. Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say: He is not flogged</b> for taking a false oath. They disagree with regard to the reason that he is not flogged. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He is not flogged due to</b> the fact <b>that it is a prohibition that does not involve an action,</b> as he violates the oath by failing to perform an action rather than by performing an action, <b>and</b> the principle is: With regard to <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action, one is not flogged for its</b> violation. <b>And Reish Lakish says: He is not flogged</b> because <b>it is an uncertain forewarning,</b> as one cannot forewarn him before he fails to fulfill the oath because as long as time remains in the day he can still later eat the loaf and fulfill the oath; <b>and an uncertain forewarning is not characterized as forewarning.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Yoḥanan does not rule in accordance with the mishna here.
The Gemara resolves the difficulty: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan found another unattributed</b> mishna which holds that one is not flogged for a prohibition that does not involve an action, and he rules in accordance with that mishna.
The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> other <b>unattributed</b> mishna did he find? <b>If we say</b> he found <b>this unattributed</b> mishna, <b>as we learned</b> (<i>Pesaḥim</i> 84a): <b>But one who leaves over</b> some of the meat <b>of a ritually pure</b> Paschal offering until the morning of the fifteenth of Nisan <b>and one who breaks</b> a bone <b>of a ritually impure</b> Paschal offering <b>are not flogged</b> with <b>the forty</b> lashes, that is difficult.
First, the Gemara explains how this mishna demonstrates Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion: <b>Granted</b> that <b>breaking</b> a bone <b>of a impure</b> Paschal offering does not incur lashes, <b>as it is written: “Nor shall you break a bone in it”</b> (Exodus 12:46). The term “in it” indicates that the verse refers only <b>to a valid</b> Paschal offering, <b>but not to a disqualified</b> one, such as one that is impure. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>one who leaves over</b> some of the meat <b>of a pure</b> Paschal offering, <b>what is the reason</b> he is not flogged? <b>Is it not because it is</b> a violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action, and for</b> a violation of <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action one is not flogged?</b>
The Gemara now questions this explanation of the mishna: <b>But from where</b> is it apparent that this mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ya’akov, who says</b> that for a violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action, one is not flogged? Perhaps</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> he holds that the reason the mishna rules that one is not flogged is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the verse comes to position</b> the <b>positive mitzva</b> of burning the leftover meat <b>after</b> the <b>prohibition</b> of leaving over the meat, and one is not flogged for a prohibition whose violation obligates one in a positive mitzva. <b>But were it not for this, one would be flogged,</b> despite the fact it is a prohibition that does not involve an action. Since the unattributed mishna is not necessarily in accordance with Rabbi Yaakov’s opinion, it cannot be the basis of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling.
The Gemara cites the source of Rabbi Yaakov’s and Rabbi Yehuda’s opinions: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And <b>you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning, and that which remains of it until the morning you shall burn in fire”</b> (Exodus 12:10). <b>The verse comes to position</b> the <b>positive mitzva</b> of burning the leftover meat <b>after</b> the <b>prohibition</b> against leaving over the meat, <b>to say that one is not flogged for its</b> violation; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Ya’akov says: This is not for</b> that <b>reason; rather,</b> it is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is a prohibition that does not involve an action, and for</b> a violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action one is not flogged.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>found this unattributed</b> mishna, which teaches (27b): If one states: On my <b>oath I will not eat this loaf,</b> and immediately states: On my <b>oath I will not eat it, and</b> then <b>he ate it,</b>

Daf 4a

<b>he is liable</b> for <b>only one</b> violation. Since the second oath did not prohibit any act in addition to the first oath, he is not liable for violating it. The mishna concludes: <b>This is an oath on an utterance</b> for <b>which one is liable</b> to receive <b>lashes for its intentional</b> violation, <b>and</b> to bring <b>a sliding-scale offering for its unwitting</b> violation.
The Gemara infers from the formulation of the mishna: It <b>is</b> specifically <b>this</b> case of an oath on an utterance for <b>which one is liable</b> to receive <b>lashes for its intentional</b> violation. <b>But</b> if a person stated: On my oath <b>I will eat, and</b> then <b>he did not eat, he is not flogged.</b> Presumably this is because the violation does not involve any action. This mishna, then, can provide a basis for Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling.
The Gemara asks: <b>Now, this</b> mishna (27b) <b>is unattributed and that</b> mishna (2a) <b>is unattributed. What did</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>see that he practiced in accordance with this unattributed</b> mishna? <b>Let him</b> instead <b>practice in accordance with that unattributed</b> mishna.
The Gemara adds another question: <b>And according to your reasoning</b> that both <i>mishnayot</i> carry equal weight, then with regard to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>himself,</b> when he redacted the Mishna, <b>how could he teach us as unattributed</b> both <b>this</b> opinion in the mishna <b>here and that</b> opinion in the mishna <b>there?</b> This would result in a contradiction.
<b>Rather,</b> it is apparent that <b>initially</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>held</b> that <b>for</b> a violation of <b>a prohibition that does not involve an action one is flogged, and</b> so <b>he taught it</b> as <b>an unattributed</b> mishna, <b>and</b> later <b>he retracted</b> his opinion and <b>held</b> that <b>one is not flogged for</b> a violation of such a prohibition, <b>and</b> so <b>he taught</b> that opinion as <b>an unattributed</b> mishna. <b>And</b> he left the first mishna (2a) as it was because <b>a mishna does not move from its place,</b> i.e., since the students had already learned that mishna it was deemed inappropriate to remove it. Based on this logic, Rabbi Yoḥanan ruled in accordance with the later mishna (27b).
The Gemara clarifies: <b>In accordance with which</b> opinion <b>did you interpret</b> the mishna? <b>In accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, and</b> it is referring to liability <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes.</b> The Gemara questions this: But in the parallel case of <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks, what</b> punishment of <b>lashes is there?</b> The Gemara answers: There is a punishment of lashes in a case <b>where one cuts off his snow-white</b> leprous <b>mark [<i>baheret</i>], and in accordance with</b> the principle that <b>Rabbi Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ile’a</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ile’a says: Wherever it is stated: Observe,</b> or: <b>Lest, or: Do not, it is nothing other than a prohibition.</b> So too, with regard to leprosy, the verse states: “Observe the leprous mark” (Deuteronomy 24:8), which according to Rabbi Ile’a’s principle teaches a prohibition, namely that it is prohibited to remove the mark. Accordingly, one who violates this prohibition is liable to receive lashes.
The Gemara asks further: But in the parallel clause of acts of <b>carrying out</b> that are prohibited <b>on Shabbat, what</b> punishment of <b>lashes is there?</b> The prohibition against doing so <b>is a prohibition</b> in the Torah <b>that</b> potentially <b>serves as a mandate</b> for court-imposed <b>capital punishment, and</b> the generally accepted principle is that with regard to a violation of <b>any prohibition</b> in the Torah <b>that</b> potentially <b>serves as a mandate</b> for court-imposed <b>capital punishment, one is not flogged for its</b> violation even if no death penalty is imposed, as that prohibition is punishable only by death. The Gemara answers: <b>It is due to that</b> reason that <b>we interpreted</b> the mishna to be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, as he says</b> that with regard to <b>a prohibition</b> in the Torah <b>that</b> potentially <b>serves as a mandate</b> for court-imposed <b>capital punishment, one is flogged for its</b> violation in a case where there is no actual death penalty.
The Gemara asks: Is that to say that <b>were it not for this</b> reason, the mishna could be <b>interpreted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who holds that one is not flogged for violating such prohibitions? But then the question raised above with regard to the mishna’s detailing of the cases of one’s <b>awareness</b> of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods poses <b>a difficulty,</b> as Rabbi Akiva holds that one is not liable if he entered the Temple during a lapse of awareness of the fact that the place he entered was actually the Temple, whereas the mishna indicates one is liable in such a case. The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t you say</b> above that it is possible to conclude that the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael and</b> the liability referred to in the mishna is for liability <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes?</b> Similarly, it is <b>also</b> possible to say that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva and</b> the liability referred to in the mishna is for liability <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why did the <i>tanna</i> use the term: Cases of <b>awareness,</b> which is generally used for cases in which the transgression was performed during a lack of awareness and then subsequent awareness is necessary in order for the person to be liable to bring an offering? The <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> instead said: <b>Forewarnings,</b> as the forewarning is a necessary condition to be able to give lashes for an intentional transgression. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult;</b> emend and <b>teach</b> the mishna as saying: Cases of <b>awareness of forewarnings.</b>
The Gemara rejects the suggestion that the mishna is referring to liability to receive lashes: <b>If so,</b> if the mishna is referring to liability to receive lashes, why does it state that there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are four? There are</b> only <b>two</b> types. Since the person was forewarned he is certainly fully aware of all aspects of his transgression. Accordingly, there are only two cases of liability: For a ritually impure person who enters the Temple and for a ritually impure person who partakes of sacrificial foods. <b>And furthermore,</b> the continuation of the mishna states the case: <b>In which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning and awareness at the end, but</b> had <b>a lapse of awareness in between,</b> when he actually transgressed. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>the relevance of lapses of awareness to</b> one’s liability to receive <b>lashes? And furthermore,</b> that clause explicitly concludes: <b>This</b> person is liable <b>to</b> bring <b>a sliding-scale</b> offering. Clearly then, the mishna is not referring to liability to receive lashes.
Having rejected the suggestion that the mishna is referring to liability to be punished with lashes, it addresses the difficulty raised above that the mishna’s ruling with regard to oaths does not accord with Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion and its ruling with regard to cases of one’s awareness of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods does not accord with Rabbi Akiva’s opinion. If so, whose opinion is expressed in the mishna? <b>Rather, Rav Yosef said:</b> The mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and he formulates</b> the mishna <b>according to</b> different <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as follows: <b>With regard to</b> cases of one’s <b>awareness</b> of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, <b>he formulates it in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> and <b>with regard to oaths, he formulates it in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said: I said</b> this <b>statement</b> of Rav Yosef <b>before Rav Kahana, and he said to me: Do not say</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>formulates</b> the mishna <b>according to</b> different <b><i>tanna’im</i> but he himself does not hold accordingly.</b>
Rav Kahana continued: <b>Rather, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is explicating his own reasoning, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one is liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering <b>only for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning and awareness at the end and</b> had <b>a lapse of awareness</b> only <b>in between,</b> when he actually transgressed? <b>The verses state</b> with regard to a person’s awareness of the fact that he was impure: <b>“And it was concealed,” “and it was concealed”</b> (Leviticus 5:2–3), mentioning concealment <b>twice.</b> The first mention is necessary to teach that one is liable to bring an offering only where he was unaware of his status at the time of the transgression. The second mention is superfluous and serves to teach an additional condition for liability, that one must have had awareness of his status before the transgression. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> This proof <b>is not necessary,</b> as <b>it says</b> in the verse:

Daf 4b

<b>“And it was concealed,”</b> which indicates, <b>by inference, that</b> initially <b>he had been aware,</b> and nevertheless the verse continues to state: <b>“And he was aware”</b> (Leviticus 5:3). It emerges that the verse refers <b>here</b> to <b>two</b> different <b>periods of awareness,</b> one before the transgression and one afterward. But <b>if so, why</b> must <b>the verses state: “And it was concealed,” “and it was concealed,”</b> mentioning it twice? It is in order <b>to render one liable</b> both <b>for</b> a violation due to <b>a lapse of awareness of</b> the fact he was <b>ritually impure and for</b> a violation due to <b>a lapse of awareness of</b> the fact that the place he entered was actually the <b>Temple.</b> From this <i>baraita</i> it is apparent that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi agrees with Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion concerning which types of lapses of awareness render one liable to bring a sliding-scale offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>We have found with regard to</b> cases of one’s <b>awareness</b> of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>has</b> explained <b>his own reasoning</b> and it accords with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael. With regard to <b>oaths, where he has not</b> explained <b>his own reasoning, from where do we</b> derive that he holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva? The Gemara answers: It <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning.</b>
The Gemara presents <b>another formulation</b> of the preceding comment: The Gemara asks: <b>We have found</b> an explicit statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>with regard to</b> cases of one’s <b>awareness</b> of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods indicating <b>that he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael. With regard to oaths, from where do we</b> derive <b>that he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva?</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning.</b>
The Gemara explains the logical reasoning: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva deems</b> one <b>liable</b> for oaths <b>pertaining to the past?</b> The reason is <b>that he expounds</b> verses using the method of <b>amplifications and restrictions</b> (see 26a). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>also expounds</b> verses using the method of <b>amplifications and restrictions,</b> and consequently he arrives at the same opinion as Rabbi Akiva.
The Gemara demonstrates its point: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that <b>one can redeem</b> a woman’s <b>firstborn son with any</b> item worth five shekels, <b>except for</b> promissory <b>notes. And the Rabbis say</b> that <b>one can redeem</b> a woman’s <b>firstborn son with any</b> item worth five shekels, <b>except for</b> Canaanite <b>slaves,</b> promissory <b>notes, and land.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>He expounds</b> verses using the method of <b>amplifications and restrictions.</b> Accordingly, he expounds the verse: “And its redemption from one month shall you redeem, according to the valuation of five silver shekels by the sacred shekel” (Numbers 18:16), as follows: Concerning the phrase: <b>“And its redemption from one month,”</b> since it does not specify that only certain items can be used for the redemption, the verse <b>amplified</b> the category of items that can be used to redeem the firstborn, intimating that many different items can be used. Then, with the phrase: <b>“According to the valuation of five silver shekels,”</b> the verse <b>restricted</b> the category to items that are similar to silver shekels. Then, with the term: <b>“Shall you redeem,”</b> the verse <b>again amplified</b> the category.
According to the hermeneutical principle that when a verse <b>amplified and</b> then <b>restricted and</b> then <b>amplified, it amplified</b> the relevant category to include <b>everything</b> except for the specific matter excluded in the restriction. The Gemara elaborates: <b>What</b> is included by the fact <b>it amplified?</b> Almost <b>everything. And what</b> is excluded by the fact <b>it restricted? It restricted</b> only promissory <b>notes,</b> which are the most fundamentally dissimilar to silver shekels.
The Gemara explains the reasoning of the Rabbis: <b>And the Rabbis expound</b> verses through the method of <b>generalizations and details.</b> Accordingly, they expound the verse as follows: The phrase: <b>“And its redemption from one month,”</b> is <b>a generalization</b> which suggests that many different items can be used to redeem the firstborn. Then, the phrase: <b>“According to the valuation of five silver shekels,”</b> is <b>a detail,</b> which suggests that only items that are similar to silver shekels can be used. Then, with the term: <b>“Shall you redeem,”</b> the verse <b>again makes a generalization.</b>
Based on this exegetical method, whenever a verse has <b>a generalization and</b> then <b>a detail and</b> then <b>a generalization,</b> the principle is that <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail;</b> in this case, <b>just as the detail,</b> i.e., silver shekels, <b>is explicitly something that is movable and has intrinsic monetary</b> value, <b>so too, anything that is movable and has intrinsic monetary</b> value can be used. This <b>excludes land, which is not movable property;</b> it <b>excludes</b> Canaanite <b>slaves, who are</b> halakhically <b>compared to land;</b> and it <b>excludes</b> promissory <b>notes,</b> because <b>even though they are movable property, they do not have intrinsic monetary</b> value.
<b>Ravina said to Ameimar:</b> Does <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi really <b>expound</b> verses through the method of <b>amplifications and restrictions? But doesn’t Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>expound</b> verses through the method of <b>generalizations and details?</b>
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah provides the process by which a Hebrew slave who has already completed his six years of servitude may continue on as a slave of his master: “And you shall take the <b>awl</b> and put it through his ear and in the door” (Deuteronomy 15:17). From this verse, <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>an awl</b> can be used; <b>from where</b> do I know <b>to include the thorn of a palm [<i>hasol</i>], and a thorn, a needle, and a gimlet, and a stylus</b> for writing on wax, as valid tools for piercing his ear? <b>The verse states: “And you shall take,”</b> which indicates that <b>anything that can be taken by hand</b> is a valid tool. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> Not all these items can be used. Rather, since the verse specifies an <b>“awl,”</b> only items similar to an awl can be used; <b>just as an awl is distinct</b> in that it is fashioned <b>of metal, so too, anything</b> fashioned <b>of metal</b> can be used.
<b>And we say</b> with regard to this dispute: <b>About what do they disagree? Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>expounds</b> verses using the method of <b>generalizations and details, and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, expounds</b> verses

Daf 5a

using the method of <b>amplifications and restrictions.</b>
Ameimar answers: <b>Yes, generally</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>ex-pounds</b> verses using the method of <b>generalizations and details, but here,</b> with regard to the redemption of the firstborn, <b>this is the reason</b> that he expounds the verses using the method of amplifications and restrictions: He holds <b>in accordance with that which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught.</b>
<b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> When defining which fish it is permitted to eat, the verse states: “This you may eat, from whatever is in the water, anything that has fins and scales in the water, in the seas and in the streams” (Leviticus 11:9). The verse first states the general term: <b>“In the water,” “in the water,”</b> mentioning it <b>twice,</b> and only afterward mentions the details, i.e., “in the seas and in the streams.” When the general and detailed phrases are ordered in this way, they <b>are not</b> expounded as <b>a generalization and a detail,</b> but <b>rather</b> as <b>an amplification and a restriction.</b> Similarly, although Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi generally expounds verses using the method of generalizations and details, with regard to the redemption of the firstborn, since the verse mentions the two general terms first and mentions the specific detail only afterward, he expounds it using the method of amplifications and restrictions.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> why do they expound the verse about the redemption of a firstborn as a generalization and a detail? <b>Ravina said: Like they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>Wherever you find two generalizations juxtaposed to each other,</b> followed by a specific detail, <b>place</b> the <b>detail between</b> the two generalizations <b>and</b> thereby <b>expound them as a generalization and a detail</b> followed by another generalization.
The Gemara concludes the question it asked earlier: <b>Now that you said</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>expounds</b> verses using the method of <b>generalizations and details, perforce</b> the mishna’s ruling in the case of <b>oaths</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as it is derived by expounding the verse as an amplification and a restriction, and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does not generally expound verses in that manner. This contradicts Rav Kahana’s explanation that the mishna expresses Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s own opinion. <b>Rather,</b> one must say that <b>with regard to oaths,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>formulated</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, but he himself does not hold accordingly.</b>
§ Above (4a), the Gemara cited a <i>baraita</i>. Now the Gemara analyzes <b>the</b> matter <b>itself.</b> The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one is liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering <b>only for</b> cases <b>in which</b> he <b>had awareness at the beginning and awareness at the end, but</b> had <b>a lapse of awareness in between,</b> when he actually transgressed? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a person’s awareness of the fact that he was impure: <b>“And it was concealed,” “and it was concealed,”</b> mentioning it <b>twice</b> (Leviticus 5:2–3). The first mention teaches that one is liable only if during the transgression he was unaware of his status, and the second mention teaches that one is liable only if he had awareness of his status before the transgression. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> This proof <b>is not necessary,</b> as <b>it states</b> in the same verse: <b>“And it was concealed,”</b> which indicates, <b>by inference, that</b> initially <b>he had been aware;</b> and nevertheless the verse continues to state: <b>“And he was aware.”</b> It emerges, then, that the verse refers <b>here</b> to <b>two</b> different periods of <b>awareness,</b> one before the transgression and one afterward. But <b>if so, why</b> must <b>the verse state: “And it was concealed,”</b> a second time? It is in order <b>to render one liable</b> both <b>for</b> a violation due to <b>a lapse of awareness of</b> the fact that he was <b>ritually impure and for</b> a violation due to <b>a lapse of awareness of</b> the fact that the place he entered was actually the <b>Temple.</b>
<b>The Master said</b> in that <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And it was concealed,”</b> which indicates, <b>by inference, that</b> initially <b>he had been aware.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this <b>inferred? Rava said: From</b> the fact <b>that it is not written: And it is concealed from him,</b> which would have been the appropriate formulation had he never been aware of the matter at all. Accordingly, the phrase “and it was concealed” is to be understood as referring to a case in which he had been initially aware.
<b>Abaye said to him: If that is so,</b> then you should also make a similar inference <b>with regard to a suspected adulteress [<i>sota</i>], as it is written</b> that she is liable to undergo the ordeal of drinking the bitter waters when “a man lay with her carnally, <b>and it was concealed from the eyes of her husband”</b> (Numbers 5:13). This would indicate, <b>by inference, that initially he had been aware</b> of the fact that his wife committed adultery. Abaye explains the difficulty: <b>If he was</b> actually <b>aware</b> that his wife had committed adultery, <b>would the</b> bitter <b>waters</b> have the power to <b>examine her?</b>
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a case in which she is found guilty: <b>“And the husband will be free of sin and the wife shall bear her sin”</b> (Numbers 5:31). This verse teaches that only <b>when the husband is free of sin, the water examines his wife,</b> but if <b>the husband is not free of sin, the water does not examine his wife.</b> If the husband had been aware that his wife had committed adultery, then she is forbidden to him and he is required to divorce her. The fact he did not divorce her is considered a sin; consequently, the waters cannot examine his wife.
Abaye presents another difficulty to Rava: <b>And furthermore,</b> according to your understanding, you should also make a similar inference <b>with regard to Torah, as it is written: “And it was concealed from the eyes of all living creatures, and from those that soar in the heavens it was hidden”</b> (Job 28:21), which would indicate, <b>by inference, that</b> initially <b>there was</b> someone <b>who was aware of</b> the Torah. <b>But isn’t it written: “No man knew its value,</b> and it is not known in the land of the living” (Job 28:13)?
<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> The formulation of the verse does not indicate that he actually realized he was impure; it indicates only that he was initially aware of the fact that he had come into contact with a source of impurity, but he failed to reach the obvious conclusion that he was thereby rendered impure. And <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that the elementary <b>knowledge</b> of the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity that a person gained in his childhood <b>from his school is</b> sufficient, in light of his awareness of the fact he came into contact with a source of impurity, to be <b>considered awareness</b> of the fact that he was impure, and thereby render him liable to bring a sliding-scale offering.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But</b> how can you explain the <i>halakha</i> <b>that is taught</b> in the mishna: For cases in which <b>he did not have awareness at the beginning but had awareness at the end?</b> According to your explanation, <b>is there</b> anyone <b>who does not have</b> the elementary <b>knowledge</b> of the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity that he gained <b>from his school?</b> Abaye <b>said to him: Yes, you find it in</b> the case of <b>a child who was taken captive among gentiles,</b> who never received even the most elementary level of knowledge.
§ The mishna states (2a): With regard to acts of <b>carrying out</b> that are prohibited <b>on Shabbat,</b> there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are four. We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Shabbat</i> 2a): With regard to acts of <b>carrying out</b> that are prohibited <b>on Shabbat,</b> there are primarily <b>two</b> basic actions <b>that are four</b> cases with regard to transferring an item <b>inside,</b> to a private domain; <b>and two</b> basic actions <b>that are four</b> cases with regard to transferring an item <b>outside,</b> to a public domain. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different here that</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> There are <b>two</b> types <b>that are four, and nothing more; and what is different there,</b> in tractate <i>Shabbat</i>, <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> There are <b>two</b> actions <b>that are four</b> cases with regard to transferring an item <b>inside,</b> to a private domain, <b>and two</b> actions <b>that are four</b> cases with regard to transferring an item <b>outside,</b> to a public domain?
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in tractate <i>Shabbat</i>, <b>which is</b> where <b>the main</b> discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of Shabbat</b> is found, the mishna <b>teaches</b> both the <b>primary categories and</b> the <b>subcategories</b> of labor prohibited on Shabbat. But <b>here,</b> in tractate <i>Shevuot</i>, <b>which</b> does <b>not</b> contain <b>the main</b> discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of Shabbat,</b> the mishna <b>teaches the primary categories</b> of labor prohibited on Shabbat <b>but does not teach the subcategories</b> of labor.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the primary categories</b> of transferring an item on Shabbat? They are acts of <b>carrying out</b> from the private domain to the public domain. The Gemara objects: But the acts of <b>carrying out are</b> only <b>two</b> in number, i.e., where the carrying out is done by someone standing in the private domain and when it is done by someone in the public domain. Why then does the mishna state that there are four cases?
<b>And if you would say</b> that the mishna enumerates four types of carrying out, <b>among them</b> those <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability and among them</b> those <b>for</b> which there is <b>exemption,</b> that is not feasible, as <b>doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> this case as <b>similar to</b> the different <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks?</b> This would indicate that <b>just as there, all</b> four <b>of them</b> are types <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability, so too here,</b> with regard to carrying out on Shabbat, <b>all</b> four <b>of them</b> are types <b>for</b> which there is <b>liability.</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said</b> that the difference between the manner in which the <i>halakha</i> is cited in tractates <i>Shevuot</i> and <i>Shabbat</i> must be understood as follows: <b>There,</b> in tractate <i>Shabbat</i>, <b>which</b> contains <b>the main</b> discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of Shabbat,</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> both cases of <b>liability and</b> cases of <b>exemption.</b> But <b>here,</b> in tractate <i>Shevuot</i>, which does not contain the main discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, the mishna <b>teaches</b> only cases of <b>liability but does not teach</b> cases of <b>exemption.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> the cases of <b>liability?</b> They are acts of <b>carrying out</b> from the private domain to the public domain. The Gemara objects: But the acts of <b>carrying out are</b> only <b>two</b> in number. Why then does the mishna state that there are four cases? The Gemara explains: There are <b>two</b> cases <b>of carrying out</b> an item from a private domain to a public domain <b>and two</b> more cases <b>of bringing in</b> an item from a public domain to a private domain.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> Acts of <b>carrying out.</b> It does not appear to mention acts of bringing in at all. <b>Rav Ashi said: The <i>tanna</i> also refers to</b> an act of <b>bringing in</b> an item <b>as</b> an act of <b>carrying out</b> an item. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> do we know this?

Daf 5b

It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 73a): <b>One who carries out</b> an item <b>from</b> one <b>domain to</b> another <b>domain</b> is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara claims: <b>Are we not</b> also <b>dealing</b> with a case <b>where he is bringing</b> it <b>in</b> from a public domain to a private domain, <b>and</b> nevertheless the mishna <b>refers to it</b> as <b>carrying out?</b>
The Gemara questions this assertion: <b>But perhaps</b> the mishna is dealing with a case of <b>carrying out</b> an item <b>from a private domain to a public domain.</b> The Gemara defends its claim: <b>If so, let it</b> instead <b>teach: One who carries out</b> an item <b>from a private domain to a public domain</b> is liable. <b>What</b> is the reason it used the more generalized formulation: <b>From</b> one <b>domain to</b> another <b>domain?</b> To teach <b>that</b> one is liable <b>even</b> if one transfers an item <b>from a public domain to a private domain.</b>
The Gemara explains further: Even though the mishna addresses carrying an item in from a public domain to a private domain, <b>it refers to it as carrying out.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The <i>tanna</i> refers to any</b> act that involves <b>removal of an item from its place as carrying out.</b> Accordingly, the term can appropriately be used even when an item is brought in to a private domain from a public domain.
<b>Ravina said:</b> The language of <b>the mishna</b> in tractate <i>Shabbat</i> <b>is also precise</b> in indicating this, <b>as it teaches:</b> With regard to acts of <b>carrying out [<i>yetziyyot</i>]</b> that are prohibited <b>on Shabbat,</b> there are primarily <b>two</b> basic actions <b>that are four</b> cases from the perspective of a person <b>inside</b> a private domain, <b>and two</b> basic actions <b>that are four</b> cases from the perspective of a person <b>outside,</b> in a public domain. <b>And</b> then, immediately, in the continuation of that mishna, <b>it explicates</b> the cases of <b>bringing in</b> an item. <b>Conclude from it</b> that the term: Carrying out, is also used to refer to bringing in an item.
<b>Rava said:</b> One cannot make any inference from the language of the mishna, as it is not referring to acts of carrying out. Rather, <b>it teaches domains.</b> In other words, it means: With regard to the <b>domains of Shabbat</b> there are <b>two</b> types, the existence of which leads to four types of prohibited transfers, two with regard to carrying out and two with regard to bringing in.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to different <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks,</b> there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four. We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Nega’im</i> 1:1): With regard to different <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks,</b> there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four:</b> The <b><i>baheret</i>,</b> mentioned in the Torah (see Leviticus 13:2), is considered a primary mark; it is <b>an intense</b> white, <b>like snow. Secondary to it,</b> i.e., a sub-category of it, is a mark that is white <b>like</b> the <b>lime</b> plaster <b>of the Sanctuary</b> walls.
That mishna continues: The <b><i>se’et</i></b> mentioned in the Torah is considered a primary mark; it is <b>like white wool. Secondary to it</b> is a mark that is white <b>like the membrane of an egg.</b> The ordering of different shades is relevant in determining which shades can be combined together. In order for a leprous mark to be halakhically significant, it must at least be the size of a split Cilician bean [<i>geris</i>]. If a mark is that size, but it is composed of different shades of white, none of which is alone the size of a <i>geris</i>, then if the different shades are compatible they can combine together and will thereby render the person ritually impure.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this mishna, which delineates the different <b>shades of leprous marks</b> into two groups? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. As if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> one would be presented with a difficulty: <b>Since</b> with regard to which shades can combine together, Rabbi Akiva <b>says:</b> The different shades should be ordered <b>this</b> one <b>above this</b> one, <b>and that</b> one <b>above that</b> one, i.e., according to their degrees of brightness, from the most bright to the darkest shade, as follows: Snow white, i.e., <i>baheret</i>; wool white, i.e., <i>se’et</i>; lime; and egg membrane; and only two adjacent shades can combine together. But <b>if so, you have rendered pure</b> a mark that is white like the <b>lime</b> plaster <b>of the Sanctuary</b> walls and is smaller than a <i>geris</i>, as <b>it cannot be combined</b> with any other shade of white.
The Gemara explains: <b>With which</b> other shade <b>could we combine</b> the lime-colored mark? We cannot say: <b>Let us combine it together with</b> a snow-white <b><i>baheret</i>,</b> which is the primary mark relative to a lime-colored mark, as <b>there is</b> a wool-white <b><i>se’et</i>, which is a more</b> bright white <b>than</b> a lime-colored mark but less bright than snow white. Since <i>baheret</i> is not adjacent to lime it cannot combine with it. We cannot say: <b>Let us combine it together with a <i>se’et</i>,</b> as a lime-colored mark <b>is not its secondary</b> mark and a primary mark can combine only with its secondary mark. This is difficult because the mishna’s categorization of a lime-colored mark as a secondary mark indicates that it can be combined with another shade of white. Perforce, the mishna is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that Rabbi Akiva holds that only adjacent shades of white can combine together, why didn’t Rabbi Ḥanina <b>also</b> bring proof from a mark that is white like the <b>membrane of an egg,</b> as <b>with which</b> other shade <b>could we combine it?</b> We cannot say: <b>Let us combine it together with</b> a wool-white <b><i>se’et</i>,</b> which is the primary mark relative to an egg membrane–colored mark, as <b>there is a lime</b>-colored mark, <b>which is a more</b> bright white <b>than</b> an egg membrane–colored mark but less bright that wool white. Since <i>se’et</i> is not adjacent to egg membrane it cannot combine with it. We cannot say: <b>Let us combine it together with a lime</b>-colored mark, as it <b>is not its type,</b> i.e., they are not of the same category, and so they cannot combine.

Daf 6a

The Gemara answers: <b>What is this</b> comparison? <b>Granted,</b> it would all be well <b>were it not for</b> the difficulty with regard to a mark the color of the <b>lime</b> plaster <b>of the Sanctuary</b> walls, as the difficulty raised with regard to <b>an egg membrane–</b>colored mark is <b>not difficult. As even though</b> the shade of <b>an egg membrane</b> is two stages <b>below</b> that <b>of a <i>se’et</i>, the Merciful One states: “And for a <i>se’et</i> and for a <i>sappaḥat</i>”</b> (Leviticus 14:56), which indicates that <b>a <i>sappaḥat</i> is secondary to a <i>se’et</i></b> and can combine with it <b>even though</b> a <i>sappaḥat</i> <b>is</b> of <b>a much lower</b> degree of brightness <b>than it.</b> Rabbi Akiva holds that both of the additional shades not explicitly mentioned in the Torah are derived from the word: <i>Sappaḥat</i>, and so both of them can combine with a <i>se’et</i>. <b>But</b> the difficulty raised with regard to a mark the color of the <b>lime</b> plaster <b>of the Sanctuary</b> walls is indeed <b>difficult. Rather, it is clear</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>
§ The Gemara elaborates on Rabbi Akiva’s opinion: <b>And where have we learned</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Akiva</b> the different shades should be ordered <b>this</b> one <b>above that</b> one, i.e., according to their degrees of brightness, and only two adjacent shades can combine together?
<b>If we say</b> we learned it <b>from that which is taught</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>, it is difficult. The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>Rabbi Yosei said</b> that <b>Yehoshua, son of Rabbi Akiva, asked of Rabbi Akiva: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that the different <b>shades of</b> leprous <b>marks are two</b> types <b>that are four,</b> and proceed to specify their names? Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: But if not</b> that, <b>what</b> else <b>could they say?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua answered him: <b>Let them say</b> that any mark of a degree of brightness <b>from</b> that of <b>an egg membrane and above is ritually impure.</b>
Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him:</b> They specified the four different shades in order <b>to say that they combine with each other</b> in that order, i.e., each one with its adjacent shade. Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him:</b> If so, <b>let them</b> simply <b>say:</b> Any mark of a degree of brightness <b>from</b> that of an <b>egg membrane and above is ritually impure, and they combine with each other.</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him:</b> They specified their names in order <b>to tell you: Any priest who is not an expert in</b> distinguishing between <b>them and</b> in identifying <b>their names is not</b> authorized to <b>inspect the</b> leprous <b>marks</b> and make a decision regarding them.
The Gemara explains the difficulty: Rabbi Yehoshua suggested that according to Rabbi Akiva’s opinion it should be sufficient to say that any mark of a degree of brightness from that of an egg membrane and upward is impure, <b>but he did not say</b> that it would also be necessary to add: And any mark of a degree of brightness <b>from</b> that of the <b>lime</b> plaster <b>of the Sanctuary</b> walls <b>and above</b> is impure. If Rabbi Akiva agrees to the categorization of the mishna, then it would be necessary to state separately each category of marks, in a dual formulation, in order to indicate that only shades that are categorized together can combine.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Conclude from</b> the fact <b>that he did not say</b> this <b>to</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>heard of Rabbi Akiva that he says: All</b> the different shades <b>combine with a <i>se’et</i>.</b> Accordingly, both a snow-white <i>baheret</i> and a lime-colored mark will each combine with a <i>se’et</i>, as they are adjacent to it when listed in order of their degrees of brightness. An egg membrane–colored mark will also combine with a <i>se’et</i>, as it is derived from the word: <i>Sappaḥat</i>, and the Torah indicates that a <i>sappaḥat</i> is secondary to a <i>se’et</i>.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But perhaps</b> Rabbi Akiva does hold that the only combinations possible are <b><i>a se’et</i> and its secondary</b> mark, i.e., an egg membrane–colored mark; and <b>a <i>baheret</i> and its secondary</b> mark, i.e., a lime-colored mark. And perhaps Rabbi Yehoshua in fact proposed that the Sages should use a dual formulation, but the <i>baraita</i> cites only the first half of his suggestion.
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Akiva’s opinion can be inferred <b>from that</b> which <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The following is <b>an analogy</b> to illustrate the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva: To what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to four cups of milk,</b> and <b>two drops of blood fell into one</b> of them, <b>and four drops of blood fell into</b> another <b>one</b> of them, <b>and eight</b> drops of blood <b>fell into</b> another <b>one, and twelve drops</b> of blood <b>fell into</b> the last <b>one. And some say</b> that <b>sixteen drops</b> fell into the last cup. This is a suitable analogy, <b>as</b> the milk in <b>all of</b> the cups still <b>has</b> a similar <b>shade of white, but</b> the cups can be ordered according to their degrees of brightness, <b>as this</b> one is <b>above this</b> one, <b>and that</b> one is <b>above that</b> one. Rabbi Ḥanina’s analogy would appear to portray Rabbi Akiva’s opinion in the same way it was cited earlier.
The Gemara rejects this. The Torah states that a “reddish-white affliction” (Leviticus 13:42), not just a flawless white one, renders a person ritually impure. Therefore, the Gemara suggests: <b>Say that you heard Rabbi Akiva</b> express this opinion <b>with regard to</b> combining different shades of a mark that is <b>mixed [<i>befatukh</i>]</b> with red, which is the case most similar to the analogy offered by Rabbi Ḥanina, but <b>with regard to</b> different shades of <b>flawless</b> white, <b>have you heard</b> Rabbi Akiva express this opinion?
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>just as you heard</b> Rabbi Akiva express this opinion <b>with regard to</b> a mark that is <b>mixed</b> with red, <b>so too,</b> by logical extension, <b>you have</b> effectively <b>heard</b> Rabbi Akiva express this opinion <b>with regard to</b> different shades of <b>flawless</b> white, as what possible reason is there to differentiate between them, this is difficult. <b>And</b> this suggestion is problematic, as <b>in the case of a mixed</b> reddish-white mark <b>itself, did you</b> ever <b>hear him</b> express this opinion? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a mishna (<i>Nega’im</i> 1:2): With regard to the various shades of white that are mixed with red, <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> the <b>reddish</b> variation <b>of this</b> one, i.e., of a <i>baheret</i>, <b>and of that</b> one, i.e., of a lime-colored mark, <b>are like wine diluted in water, except</b> for the following distinction: That the reddish variation <b>of a <i>baheret</i> is</b> still an <b>intense</b> white, <b>like snow,</b> albeit with a somewhat pinkish hue, <b>but</b> the reddish variation <b>of lime is darker than it.</b>

Daf 6b

<b>And if it is so</b> that Rabbi Akiva lists the different shades in decreasing order of their degree of brightness, then after mentioning the reddish variation of <i>baheret</i> <b>he should have</b> next said: The reddish variation <b>of a wool-</b>white mark <b>is darker than it,</b> not that the reddish variation of lime is darker than it.
<b>They said</b> in response to this: <b>Yes, it is indeed so</b> that Rabbi Akiva continues by referring to the reddish variations of a wool-white mark, <b>and it is taught</b> likewise in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says,</b> referring to that mishna: It is <b>not</b> correct <b>that Rabbi Akiva said:</b> The reddish variation <b>of lime is darker than it; rather,</b> he said that the reddish variation <b>of a</b> wool-white mark <b>is darker than it.</b>
§ The Gemara considers the source from which the different shades of marks are derived: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that <i>baheret</i> is an intense</b> white color? <b>Abaye said: The verse states:</b> “And <b>if it is a white <i>baheret</i>”</b> (Leviticus 13:4), which indicates that <b>it</b> alone <b>is</b> a bright <b>white and there is no other</b> as <b>white</b> as it.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The bright shade of <b>a <i>baheret</i></b> makes it appear <b>deeper</b> than the surrounding skin, <b>and so</b> the verse <b>states: “And its appearance is deeper than the skin”</b> (Leviticus 13:25). This is <b>like the appearance of</b> an area illuminated by the <b>sun, which</b> appears <b>deeper than</b> the area in <b>the shade.</b> The darker shade of <b>a <i>se’et</i></b> makes it appear as though it is raised above the surrounding skin; this is indicated by the fact that the word <b><i>se’et</i></b> means <b>nothing other than raised, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “Upon all the high mountains and upon all the raised up [<i>hanissaot</i>] hills”</b> (Isaiah 2:14). The words <i>hanissaot</i> and <i>se’et</i> share the same Hebrew root and both refer to something raised up. In the verse: “For a <i>se’et</i> and for a <i>sappaḥat</i>” (Leviticus 14:56), the word <b><i>sappaḥat</i></b> means <b>nothing other than secondary, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “And he will say: Append me [<i>sefaḥeni</i>] please</b> to one of the priestly classes to eat a piece of bread” (I Samuel 2:36). This teaches that there is a leprous mark that is secondary and appended to a <i>se’et</i>. This is a mark that is the color of an egg membrane.
<b>We found</b> a source for a mark that is <b>secondary to a <i>se’et</i>; from where do we</b> derive that there is also a mark that is <b>secondary to a <i>baheret</i>? Rabbi Zeira said: “White”</b> (Leviticus 13:10) <b>is stated with regard to a <i>se’et</i> and “white”</b> (Leviticus 13:4) <b>is stated with regard to a <i>baheret</i>.</b> This teaches that <b>just as</b> the shade of <b>white stated with regard to a <i>se’et</i> has a secondary</b> mark, i.e., the mark that is the color of an egg membrane, <b>so too,</b> the shade of <b>white stated with regard to a <i>baheret</i> has a secondary</b> mark, i.e., the lime-colored mark.
A different source for this <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse</b> (see Leviticus 13:2) <b>placed</b> the word <b><i>sappaḥat</i> between <i>se’et</i> and <i>baheret</i>, to say to you: Just as</b> there is a shade that is <b>secondary to a <i>se’et</i>, so too,</b> there is a shade that is <b>secondary to a <i>baheret</i>.</b>
The mishna in <i>Nega’im</i> cited above states: <b>A <i>se’et</i></b> is <b>like white wool.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>white wool? Rav Beivai says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says:</b> It is the color of <b>clean wool</b> from a lamb <b>that</b> is <b>wrapped up [<i>mekhabnin</i>]</b> in a cover when it is <b>one day old</b> in order to protect it from being sullied, so that the wool will be suitable <b>for</b> producing <b>a fine wool</b> garment.
§ In continuation of his statement cited above <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The following is <b>an analogy</b> to illustrate the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the opinion expressed in the mishna in <i>Nega’im</i> (1:1) that both a <i>baheret</i> and a <i>se’et</i> have marks that are secondary to them. <b>To what is this matter comparable? To two kings and to two governors [<i>iparkhei</i>]</b> where, with regard to their supremacy, <b>the king of this</b> governor <b>is above the king of that</b> governor, <b>and the governor of this</b> king <b>is above the governor of that</b> king. The two kings are analogous to a <i>baheret</i> and a <i>se’et</i> and their two governors are, respectively, a lime-colored mark and an egg membrane–colored mark. Accordingly, the order of supremacy is: <i>Baheret</i>, <i>se’et</i>, lime-colored mark, egg membrane–colored mark.
The Gemara questions whether this is a suitable analogy for the opinion of the Rabbis: But <b>this</b> analogy suggests that the shades are ordered, <b>this</b> one <b>above this</b> one <b>and that</b> one <b>above that</b> one, i.e., according to their degrees of brightness. That is Rabbi Akiva’s opinion, not the opinion of the Rabbis.
<b>Rather,</b> a suitable analogy is where <b>the king of this</b> governor is <b>above his own governor, and the king of that</b> governor is <b>above his own governor.</b> So too, each secondary mark is subordinate only to its primary mark.
The Gemara presents a different analogy. <b>Rav Adda bar Abba said: For example: A king, and a chief officer [<i>alkafta</i>], the vizier [<i>rofila</i>], and the Exilarch;</b> each person in the list is more powerful than the subsequent one. The Gemara asks: But <b>this</b> analogy suggests that the shades are ordered, <b>this</b> one <b>above that</b> one, which is Rabbi Akiva’s opinion. <b>Rather,</b> a suitable analogy is, <b>for example: A king and the vizier; and a chief officer and the Exilarch.</b> This list splits the four into two groups, each group containing one person who is subordinate to the other.
The Gemara presents a different analogy. <b>Rava said:</b> The previous suggestion is not precise because all these positions, apart from the king, are subordinate to the king. A more precise analogy would be, <b>for example: King Shapur,</b> the king of Persia, with his subordinate; <b>and</b> the Roman <b>emperor</b> with his subordinate.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: Which of them is greater,</b> King Shapur or the Roman emperor? Rava <b>said to him: Does he eat in the forest,</b> i.e., do you live disconnected and unaware of events in the world at large? <b>Go out</b> and <b>see whose coin circulates throughout the world,</b> which is an indicator of a government’s influence, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the fourth empire described in Daniel’s dream of the future powers of the world: <b>“It shall devour the whole earth and tread upon it and break it into pieces”</b> (Daniel 7:23), and <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is the guilty</b> empire of <b>Rome whose coin circulates throughout the entire world.</b>
The Gemara presents a different analogy. <b>Ravina said: For example,</b> a new white <b>woolen garment and a frayed</b> one; a new <b>linen sheet and a frayed one.</b>
§ The mishna (2a) states: In cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning</b> and awareness at the end, but had a lapse of awareness in between while he actually transgressed, this person is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that the verse</b> that describes the liability for a sliding-scale offering (see Leviticus 5:2–4) <b>speaks of nothing other than</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods? While the verse mentions that a violation was committed due to a lapse of awareness of one’s state of impurity, it does not mention which transgression was violated.
The Gemara explains: <b>And it is a logical inference: Since</b> the Torah has explicitly <b>prohibited and</b> also <b>prescribed punishment for the</b> intentional <b>defiling</b> of something sacred <b>and has rendered one liable</b> to bring <b>an offering for the</b> unwitting <b>defiling</b> of something sacred, it follows that <b>just as when it prohibited and</b> also <b>prescribed punishment for the defiling</b> of something sacred <b>it prohibited and</b> also <b>prescribed punishment only for the</b> intentional <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods; <b>so too, when it rendered one liable</b> to bring <b>an offering for the defiling</b> of something sacred <b>it rendered one liable</b> to do so <b>only for the</b> unwitting <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods.
The Gemara asks: <b>But say</b> instead that the obligation to bring a sliding-scale offering is referring to a ritually impure person who partook of <b>the sacred portion of produce grown in Eretz Yisrael that is designated to be given to a priest [<i>teruma</i>], as</b> the Torah also <b>has</b> explicitly <b>prohibited and prescribed punishment</b> for this. One who partakes of <i>teruma</i> while ritually impure is liable to receive death at the hand of Heaven (see Leviticus 22:9). The Gemara answers: It cannot be referring to <i>teruma</i>, because <b>we do not find a sin</b> whose punishment for an intentional violation is <b>death,</b> with regard to <b>which</b> one <b>is liable</b> to bring <b>an offering</b> for its unwitting violation. Sin-offerings, of which the sliding-scale offering is one type, are brought only for transgressions whose intentional violation is punishable by <i>karet</i>.
The Gemara asks: But <b>say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies only to <b>a fixed</b> sin-<b>offering, but</b>

Daf 7a

<b>one can bring a sliding-scale</b> offering for the unwitting violation of a transgression whose intentional violation is not punishable by <i>karet</i>; <b>just as is</b> the case of a violation <b>for “hearing the voice”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), which is where a litigant asks a witness to testify about an event and he takes a false oath that he did not witness the event, <b>and for</b> taking a false oath with the <b>“utterance of lips”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). In both of these cases, an intentional violation is not punishable by <i>karet</i>, and nevertheless one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering for an unwitting violation.
The Gemara answers: It cannot be referring to one who partakes of <i>teruma</i> while ritually impure, as <b>the verse</b> concerning a sliding-scale offering <b>states:</b> “Or if he will touch impurity of a man in any manner of his impurity <b>through which</b> he can become impure” (Leviticus 5:3). The verse states <b>“through which” to exclude</b> an impure person who partakes of <b><i>teruma</i></b> from liability to bring a sliding-scale offering.
The Gemara asks: But <b>say</b> the verse states <b>“through which” to exclude</b> one who defiles the <b>Temple,</b> and teaches <b>that</b> due to the severity of that transgression it is <b>not sufficient for him</b> to achieve atonement <b>with a sliding-scale offering;</b> rather, he will not achieve atonement <b>until he brings a fixed</b> sin-<b>offering.</b> Accordingly, no proof can be drawn from here.
<b>Rava read</b> the following verse <b>about Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>“One who draws water from deep wells”</b> (see Proverbs 20:5); this verse describes Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, because by delving deeply into the Bible he found a source that a sliding-scale offering atones for the unwitting defiling of sacrificial foods by partaking of them while ritually impure.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse: “Or if a person will have touched any impure object, whether the carcass of an impure animal [<i>ḥayya</i>] or the carcass of an impure domesticated animal [<i>behema</i>]” (Leviticus 5:2). <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> Since a domesticated animal is also referred to a <i>ḥayya</i>, it would be sufficient if <b>I would read</b> only the verse’s clause about <b>a <i>ḥayya</i>. Why</b> then is an explicit clause about <b>a <i>behema</i> stated?</b> It is in order to derive a verbal analogy. It is <b>stated</b> in the verse <b>here: “An impure domesticated animal,” and it is stated</b> in the verse <b>below</b> with regard to one who intentionally defiles an offering by partaking of it while he is impure: <b>“An impure domesticated animal”</b> (Leviticus 7:21). <b>Just as below</b> the reference is to the <b>defiling of sacrificial</b> foods, <b>so too here,</b> the reference is to the <b>defiling of sacrificial</b> foods.
The Gemara continues: <b>We found</b> a source for the <i>halakha</i> that the sliding-scale offering atones for the <b>defiling of sacrificial</b> foods; <b>from where do we</b> derive that it also atones for the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple</b> by entering it while ritually impure? <b>The verse states</b> with regard to a woman after childbirth, who is impure due to having given birth: <b>“She may not touch any sacred item and she may not enter the Temple”</b> (Leviticus 12:4). The verse <b>juxtaposes the Temple to sacred</b> items to teach that the <i>halakhot</i> that apply to one apply to the other. Accordingly, the sliding-scale offering atones for both.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that the liability to bring a sliding-scale offering is derived from this verse, then one should <b>also</b> be liable to bring the offering if he partakes of <b><i>teruma</i></b> while impure, <b>as the Master said</b> that the general term “sacred item,” in the verse: <b>“She may not touch any sacred item,”</b> serves <b>to include <i>teruma</i></b> in the prohibition. Accordingly, it should also be included in the obligation to bring a sliding-scale offering.
The Gemara explains: <b>The Merciful One excludes</b> something with the term <b>“through which”</b> (Leviticus 5:3). Should <b>we say</b> that the term <b>“through which”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> the defiling of the <b>Temple?</b> No, it <b>is reasonable</b> that <b>we should not exclude</b> the defiling of the <b>Temple, as</b> its intentional violation is punishable <b>by <i>karet</i>, just like</b> one who defiles sacrificial foods by partaking of them while he is impure. Rather, the term must serve to exclude one who partakes of <i>teruma</i> while impure.
The Gemara offers a counterargument: <b>On the contrary, we should not exclude</b> one who partakes of <b><i>teruma</i></b> while impure, <b>as</b> it is a violation done through <b>eating, similar to</b> one who eats sacrificial food while impure. Therefore, there is still no proof that one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering for defiling the Temple.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> it can be derived from the following: <b>Why</b> does the Torah mention <b>three</b> times the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> with regard to</b> one who partakes of <b>peace-offerings</b> while he is impure? The three times are Leviticus 22:3, 7:20, and 7:21. <b>One</b> time is <b>to</b> apply the punishment to the <b>general</b> case of a ritually impure person who partakes of any type of offering, <b>and one</b> time is <b>to</b> apply it to the <b>specific</b> instance of a peace-offering, <b>and one</b> time is <b>to</b> apply it to another case of <b>defiling</b> something sacred <b>that is written in the Torah without specifying</b> what it is referring to, <b>and I do not know</b> from that passage <b>what</b> that case <b>is.</b>
Rava continues: The only passage that describes the defiling of something sacred without specifying the situation is the passage in the Torah that discusses a sliding-scale offering brought for the defiling of sacrificial foods. Therefore, <b>you must say</b> that the third mention of <i>karet</i> is referring to the <b>defiling of sacrificial</b> foods. <b>But if it is not</b> needed to teach the <b>matter of defiling sacrificial</b> foods, <b>as that has been derived through</b> the verbal analogy <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of defiling</b> the <b>Temple.</b> Accordingly, one who intentionally defiles the Temple by entering it while impure is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, and it is reasonable that he should be liable to bring a sliding-scale offering for doing so unwittingly.
The Gemara asks: <b>But that</b> third mention <b>is necessary</b> in order <b>to</b> expound it <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu, as Rabbi Abbahu says: Why</b> does the Torah mention <b>three</b> times the punishment of <b><i>karet</i> with regard to</b> one who partakes of <b>peace-offerings</b> while he is ritually impure? <b>One</b> time is <b>to</b> apply the punishment to the <b>general</b> case of an impure person who partakes of any type of offering, <b>and one</b> time is <b>to</b> apply it to the <b>specific</b> instance of a peace-offering, <b>and one</b> time is <b>to</b> apply it to an impure person who eats <b>items that are not</b> generally <b>eaten,</b> such as frankincense.
The Gemara adds: <b>And according to Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that for <b>items that are not</b> generally <b>eaten one is not liable</b> to be punished with <b><i>karet</i> for</b> partaking of <b>them</b> while he is <b>ritually impure,</b> the third mention is necessary in order <b>to include</b> the case of an impure person who eats <b>an internal sin</b>-offering, <b>as it could enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since Rabbi Shimon says: For any</b> type of offering <b>that is not sacrificed on</b> and its blood applied to <b>the external altar in the manner</b> that <b>peace-offerings</b> are, <b>one cannot be liable</b> to be punished with <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> eating it if it is <b><i>piggul</i>,</b> i.e., for eating such an offering if it was sacrificed with the intent to consume it after its appointed time. One might have thought that similarly, for such an offering, <b>one is also not</b> liable to be punished with <i>karet</i> <b>for</b> intentionally partaking of <b>it</b> while <b>ritually impure;</b> the third mention <b>teaches us that one is</b> indeed <b>liable.</b> Therefore, there is still no proof that one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering for unwittingly entering the Temple while impure.
<b>Rather,</b> the Sages <b>of Neharde’a said in the name of Rava</b> that it can be derived from the following: <b>Why</b> does the Torah mention <b>three</b> times the <b>ritually impure</b> status <b>with regard to</b> one who partakes of <b>peace-offerings</b> while he is impure? That is, each of the three times that the Torah mentions the punishment of <i>karet</i>, it also mentions the fact that the person was impure at the time. <b>One</b> time is <b>for</b> the <b>general</b> case of a impure person who partakes of any type of offering, <b>and one</b> time is <b>for</b> the <b>specific</b> instance of one who partakes of a peace-offering, <b>and one</b> time is <b>to</b> apply it to another case of <b>defiling</b> something sacred <b>that is written in the Torah without specifying</b> what it is referring to, <b>and I do not know</b> from that passage <b>what</b> the case <b>is.</b>
Now, the only passage that describes the defiling of something sacred without specifying the situation is the passage in the Torah that discusses a sliding-scale offering that is brought for the defiling of sacrificial foods. Therefore, <b>you must say</b> that the third mention of <i>karet</i> is referring to the <b>defiling of sacrificial</b> foods. <b>But if it is not</b> needed to teach the <b>matter of defiling sacrificial</b> foods, <b>as that has been derived through</b> the verbal analogy <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of defiling</b> the <b>Temple.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But that</b> third mention <b>is also necessary,</b> because <b>since it is necessary</b> for the Torah <b>to write</b> the <b><i>karet</i></b> punishment three times in order <b>to</b> expound it <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu, it also</b> has to <b>write</b> that the person was <b>ritually impure, as it is not sufficient</b> to mention the punishment <b>without</b> mentioning for what the punishment is given. Accordingly, there is still no proof that one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering for unwittingly defiling the Temple.
<b>Rather, Rava said: It is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the terms <b>“his impurity”</b> and <b>“his impurity,”</b> as follows: <b>It is written here,</b> with regard to a sliding-scale offering: “Or if he will touch impurity of a man <b>in any manner of his impurity</b> through which he can become impure” (Leviticus 5:3),

Daf 7b

<b>and it is written there</b> with regard to the red heifer: “Whoever touches the corpse of a man who died and is not sprinkled, he will have contaminated the Tabernacle of God…<b>he will be impure, his impurity is still upon him”</b> (Numbers 19:13). This verbal analogy teaches that <b>just as there</b> the verse is referring to the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple, so too here,</b> the sliding-scale offering is brought to atone for the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>why do I</b> need the term <b>“through which”</b> (Leviticus 5:3)? The Gemara earlier derived from this term that one who is impure and unwittingly eats <i>teruma</i> is not liable to bring a sliding-scale offering. The Gemara has now derived that the sliding-scale offering atones specifically for the unwitting defiling of the Temple. If so, it is obvious that one is not liable for unwittingly eating <i>teruma</i>, and the phrase is superfluous.
The Gemara answers: The term “through which” serves <b>to include</b> one who was rendered impure by eating the unslaughtered <b>carcass of a kosher bird.</b> Unlike other impure items, which render impure any person who touches them, the carcass of a kosher bird renders a person impure only if he eats it. Therefore, one might have thought he would not be liable for entering the Temple if he was rendered impure by having eating the carcass of a kosher bird. The extra term is therefore necessary to teach that one is liable.
The Gemara challenges: But <b>didn’t you say</b> above that the term <b>“through which” is a restriction?</b> How can you now use it to include additional cases? The Gemara explains: It is precisely <b>because it is a restriction</b> that <b>it includes</b> additional cases. As <b>it is written</b> at the beginning of that verse: <b>“Or if he will touch</b> an impurity of a man” (Leviticus 5:3), which indicates that one who is impure with a form of impurity <b>that can</b> impart impurity through <b>touching, yes,</b> he is liable for defiling the Temple by entering it in his impure state. But if one is impure with a form of impurity <b>that cannot</b> impart impurity through <b>touching,</b> then one would <b>not</b> be liable. Therefore, the verse opens with a restriction, and when the verse continues, <b>and it is written “through which,”</b> which is also <b>a restriction,</b> this <b>constitutes a restriction after a restriction, and a restriction after a restriction</b> serves <b>only to amplify</b> the <i>halakha</i>, applying it to additional cases.
§ The mishna continues: For cases <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning,</b> but then transgressed during a lapse of awareness <b>and</b> still <b>had no awareness at the end,</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur, and Yom Kippur itself, suspend any punishment that he deserves until he becomes aware of his transgression, at which point he must bring a sliding-scale offering. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the internal goat offering: <b>“And he shall effect atonement upon the Sanctuary from the impurities of the children of Israel</b> and from their acts of rebellion, for all their sins” (Leviticus 16:16).
<b>With regard to this matter,</b> i.e., the atonement effected by the sacrifice of the goat, <b>I can</b> state that this verse serves <b>to amplify</b> the atonement by teaching that the goat offering atones for the following <b>three</b> sins, which the Torah is referring to as <b>impurities: The impurity of</b> the sin of <b>idol worship, and the impurity of</b> engaging in <b>forbidden sexual relations, and the impurity of</b> perpetrating <b>bloodshed.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> demonstrates that each of these sins is referred to as impurity: <b>With regard to idol worship</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “For he had given his offspring to Molekh <b>in order to render impure My Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 20:3). <b>With regard to forbidden sexual relations</b> the verse <b>states: “You shall safeguard My charge not to do any of the abominable traditions</b> that were done before you <b>and not to render yourself impure through them”</b> (Leviticus 18:30). <b>With regard to bloodshed</b> the verse <b>states:</b> “The land will not atone for the blood that was spilled on it except through the blood of the one who spilled it; <b>you shall not render the land impure”</b> (Numbers 35:34). One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the goat</b> offering <b>would atone for these three</b> types of <b>impurities.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “From the impurities of the children of Israel”</b> (Leviticus 16:16). The restrictive term “from” indicates that it atones for some impurities <b>but not</b> for <b>all impurities.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> derives the type of impurity for which the goat offering does atone: <b>What do we find</b> is the impurity <b>that the verse differentiates from all</b> other <b>impurities? You must say</b> that the verse is referring to the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods. It is specifically for this transgression that the Torah provides one with the means of achieving atonement, i.e., by bringing a sliding-scale offering. <b>So too here,</b> since the verse limits the atonement of the goat offering to transgressions involving impurity, it is logical that it can also atone only <b>for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> It is not necessary to derive which transgressions the goat offering atones for by comparing the verse written concerning it to a different verse. Rather, <b>from its</b> own <b>place,</b> i.e., from the verse about the atonement effected by the goat itself, <b>it</b> can be <b>determined, as it states: “And he shall effect atonement upon the Sanctuary [<i>hakodesh</i>] from the impurities</b> of the children of Israel,” which should be interpreted as saying that it atones <b>for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> anything <b>sacred [<i>kodesh</i>],</b> i.e., the Temple or its sacrificial foods.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>this goat</b> offering <b>would atone for all</b> cases of the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple,</b> even where there was awareness at the beginning and at the end. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “And from their acts of rebellion, for all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:16), which indicates that the goat offering atones only for <b>sins</b> that are <b>similar to acts of rebellion. Just as</b> it atones for <b>acts of rebellion that are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering,</b> as sin-offerings brought by an individual are brought only for unwitting sins, <b>so too,</b> it atones only for <b>sins that are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering.</b> As long as one does not become aware of his sin, it cannot be atoned for through the sliding-scale offering. Accordingly, the goat will atone for it.
The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>for</b> a case <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning but did not have awareness at the end, that this goat suspends</b> the punishment that he deserved until he becomes aware of his transgression? <b>The verse states “for all their sins,”</b> from which <b>it is indicated</b> that the goat offering atones only for <b>those who are</b> potentially <b>liable to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering,</b> i.e., the sliding-scale offering, should they become aware of their sin.
The Gemara clarifies some of the details of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said: With regard to this matter, I can</b> state that this verse serves <b>to amplify</b> the atonement by teaching that the goat offering atones for the following <b>three</b> sins, which the Torah is referring to as <b>impurities: The impurity of</b> the sin of <b>idol worship, and the impurity of</b> engaging in <b>forbidden sexual relations, and the impurity of</b> perpetrating <b>bloodshed.</b>
The Gemara asks: Concerning <b>this</b> sin of <b>idol worship,</b> for which one might have thought the goat would atone, <b>what are the circumstances? If</b> you say the reference is to a case where he transgressed <b>intentionally,</b> then one can counter that <b>he is subject to the death</b> penalty and no offering will atone for his sin. And <b>if</b> you say the reference is to a case where he transgressed <b>unwittingly,</b> then one can counter that <b>he is liable to</b> bring his own sin-<b>offering</b> for his transgression, and the goat will not atone for him.
The Gemara answers: The goat offering atones in a case where he transgressed <b>intentionally but</b> witnesses <b>did not forewarn him</b> about his transgression, and therefore he is not liable to receive the death penalty. It also atones in a case where he transgressed <b>unwittingly, but</b> by the time Yom Kippur arrived <b>he had</b> still <b>not become aware</b> of his transgression and therefore he was not liable to bring an offering.

Daf 8a

The Gemara asks further: With regard to <b>forbidden sexual relations,</b> for which one might have thought the goat offering would atone <b>as well, what are the circumstances? If</b> you say the reference is to a case where he transgressed <b>intentionally,</b> then one can counter that <b>he is subject to the death</b> penalty and so no offering will atone for his sin. And <b>if</b> you say the reference is to a case where he transgressed <b>unwittingly,</b> then one can counter that <b>he is liable to</b> bring his own <b>sin-offering</b> for his transgression, and so the goat will not atone for him.
The Gemara answers: The goat offering atones in a case where he transgressed <b>intentionally but</b> witnesses <b>did not forewarn him</b> about his transgression, so he is not liable to receive the death penalty. It also atones in a case where he transgressed <b>unwittingly, but</b> by the time Yom Kippur arrived <b>he had</b> still <b>not become aware of</b> his transgression, so he was not liable to bring an offering.
The Gemara asks further: Concerning the <b>bloodshed</b> for which one might have thought that the goat would atone <b>as well, what are the circumstances? If</b> you say the reference is to a case where he transgressed <b>intentionally,</b> then one can counter that <b>he is subject to the death</b> penalty, so no offering will atone for his sin. And <b>if</b> you say the reference is to a case where he transgressed <b>unwittingly,</b> then one can counter that <b>he is subject to</b> go into <b>exile,</b> so the goat offering will not atone for him.
The Gemara answers: The goat offering atones in a case where he transgressed <b>intentionally but</b> witnesses <b>did not forewarn him</b> about his transgression, and so he is not liable to receive the death penalty. It also atones in a case where he transgressed <b>unwittingly, but</b> by the time Yom Kippur arrived <b>he had</b> still <b>not become aware of</b> his transgression, so he was not liable to bring an offering. <b>Alternatively,</b> it is referring <b>to those</b> cases for <b>which</b> the perpetrator <b>is not subject to exile,</b> e.g., where the death was caused in a way that was almost unavoidable, or where it was very close to being considered intentional.
§ The Gemara continues to analyze the next part of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the goat</b> offering <b>would atone for these three</b> types of <b>impurities.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “From the impurities</b> of the children of Israel” (Leviticus 16:16). The restrictive term “from” indicates that it atones for some impurities <b>but not</b> for <b>all impurities. What do we find</b> is the impurity <b>that the verse differentiates from all</b> other <b>impurities?</b> We find it <b>with regard to</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods. It is specifically for this transgression that the Torah provides one with the means of achieving atonement, i.e., by bringing a sliding-scale offering. <b>So too here,</b> since the verse limits the atonement of the goat offering to transgressions involving impurity, it is logical that it can also atone only <b>for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way does the Torah <b>differentiate</b> the impurity of this transgression from other types of transgressions? It is differentiated in <b>that one brings a sliding-scale</b> offering to atone for it. But if that is a sufficient distinction, then <b>say</b> instead that the goat offering atones for <b>idol worship, and</b> in <b>what</b> way does the Torah <b>differentiate</b> it from other types of transgressions?
Before answering, the Gemara interjects with <b>a mnemonic</b> that summarizes which cases it will suggest the goat offering should atone for: <b>Idol worship, a woman after childbirth, a leper, a nazirite, etc.</b>
The Gemara returns to answer its question: It is differentiated in <b>that he brings a she-goat</b> as a sin-offering <b>and not an ewe,</b> which is the animal brought as a sin-offering for other transgressions.
<b>Rav Kahana said: We said</b> that the goat offering should atone for a transgression that the Torah <b>differentiates</b> in order <b>to be lenient</b> relative to other transgressions, <b>but this</b> case of idol worship <b>is</b> one that the Torah <b>differentiates</b> in order <b>to be stringent</b> relative to other transgressions. Accordingly, the verse cannot be referring to idol worship.
The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say</b> instead that the goat offering atones for <b>a woman after childbirth, as</b> the Torah <b>differentiates</b> her from other people who must bring a sin-offering following a period of impurity in <b>that she brings a sliding-scale</b> offering, whereas others bring a fixed sin-offering? <b>Rav Hoshaya said:</b> The verse states: <b>“For all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:16), <b>and not: For all their impurities.</b> Accordingly, since the offering brought by a woman after childbirth is not to atone for a sin, but due to the fact that she went through a period of ritual impurity, the goat offering will not atone for her.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>according to Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, who says: A woman after childbirth</b> brings an offering because <b>she is also a sinner, what is there to say?</b> Under the intense pain of childbirth a woman is apt to take an oath not to engage in intercourse in order to avoid becoming pregnant again. This is regarded as a sin because she will certainly violate that oath. The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as he said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>From its own place,</b> i.e., from the verse about the atonement of the goat offering itself, <b>it</b> can be <b>determined</b> what the goat offering atones for.
The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say</b> that the goat offering atones for <b>a leper,</b> as the Torah differentiates him from other people who must bring a fixed offering following a period of impurity in that he brings a sliding-scale offering? <b>Rav Hoshaya said:</b> The verse states: <b>“For all their sins” and not: For all their impurities.</b> Accordingly, since the offering brought by a leper is not to atone for a sin, the goat offering will not atone for him.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>according to Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani, who says:</b> Leprous <b>marks come</b> upon a person <b>for seven matters,</b> i.e., seven different sins, <b>what is there to say?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it is <b>his</b> leprous <b>mark that atones for</b> his sin, <b>and</b> the <b>offering</b> is brought in order <b>to permit him to</b> reenter <b>the congregation,</b> after having been ostracized while he was a leper.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the goat offering atones for <b>a nazirite</b> who became <b>ritually impure, as</b> the Torah <b>differentiates</b> him from other people who must bring an offering following a period of impurity in <b>that he brings doves or young pigeons? Rav Hoshaya said:</b> The verse states: <b>“For all their sins” and not: For all their impurities.</b> Accordingly, since the offering brought by a nazirite is not to atone for a sin, the goat offering will not atone for him.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, <b>according to Rabbi Elazar HaKappar, who says: A nazirite is also a sinner</b> because he unnecessarily ab-stained from wine, <b>what is there to say?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>From its own place,</b> i.e., from the verse about the atonement of the goat itself, <b>it</b> can be <b>determined</b> what the goat offering atones for.
§ The Gemara continues to clarify the next part of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said: Rabbi Shimon says:</b> It is not necessary to derive which transgressions the goat offering atones for by comparing the verse written concerning it to a different verse. Rather, <b>from its</b> own <b>place,</b> i.e., from the verse about the atonement effected by the goat itself, <b>it</b> can be <b>determined, as it states: “And he shall effect atonement upon the Sanctuary [<i>hakodesh</i>] from the impurities</b> of the children of Israel,” which should be interpreted as saying that it atones <b>for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> anything <b>sacred [<i>kodesh</i>],</b> i.e., the Temple or its sacrificial foods. The Gemara explains Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, asking: <b>Rabbi Shimon is saying well;</b> why does Rabbi Yehuda disagree? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> could have <b>said to you: That</b> verse <b>is necessary</b> to teach that <b>in the same</b> manner <b>that he performs</b> the blood presentation <b>in the innermost sanctum,</b> i.e., in the Holy of Holies, <b>that is how he shall</b> later <b>perform</b> them <b>in the Sanctuary.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> derive that <i>halakha</i>? <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the continuation of the verse: <b>“And so shall he do</b> to the Tent of Meeting,” i.e., the Sanctuary. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> derive from that part of the verse? The Gemara explains: He holds that <b>if</b> this <i>halakha</i> would be derived only <b>from that</b> part of the verse, <b>I would say</b> that <b>he should bring another bull and goat,</b> slaughter them, <b>and perform</b> the blood presentations in the Sanctuary with their blood. Therefore, the first part of verse: “And he shall effect atonement upon the Sanctuary,” <b>teaches us</b> that all the presentations are made with blood from the same bull and goat. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why does <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> not need the first part of the verse to derive this? The Gemara explains that the verse: <b>“And so shall he do to the Tent of Meeting,”</b> itself <b>indicates</b> that the blood used in the Tent of Meeting, i.e., in the Sanctuary, is <b>from</b> the same bull and goat.
§ The Gemara cites the next part of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>this goat</b> offering <b>would atone for all</b> cases of the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple,</b> even where there was awareness at the beginning and at the end. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “And from their acts of rebellion, for all their sins”</b> (Leviticus 16:16), which indicates that the goat offering atones only for transgressions with regard to which the perpetrator is not subject to bring an offering brought by an individual to atone for himself. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the case for which the goat offering does not atone? Where one <b>had awareness at the beginning and had awareness at the end.</b> The Gemara objects: But the person in <b>that</b> case <b>is subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering.</b> If so, even without this verse it would be obvious that the goat offering would not atone for him and absolve him from his obligation to bring an offering.
The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> the verse is <b>necessary</b> to teach that the goat does not atone for him in a case in <b>which he became aware</b> of his transgression <b>close to sunset</b> before the onset of Yom Kippur and was unable to bring his offering before Yom Kippur. In such a case it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>until he brings</b> his sliding-scale offering the day after Yom Kippur,

Daf 8b

the goat <b>would suspend</b> any punishment that he deserved. Therefore, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that since the transgression is of a type that is subject to an offering brought by an individual, the goat does not effect any atonement for it.
§ The Gemara cites the next part of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said: From where</b> is it derived that if a person <b>had awareness at the beginning but did not have awareness at the end, that this goat suspends</b> the punishment that he deserved until he becomes aware of his transgression? The Gemara challenges: Why does the <i>baraita</i> ask: <b>From where</b> is it derived? <b>What is</b> it that the <i>baraita</i> finds <b>difficult</b> about this that it searches for a proof for it?
The Gemara explains: <b>This is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> finds <b>difficult: Now that you have said</b> that the goat atones only for <b>sins</b> that are <b>similar to acts of rebellion,</b> such that <b>just as</b> it atones for <b>acts of rebellion that are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, so too,</b> it atones only for <b>sins that are not subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering,</b> why not compare them in a more restrictive manner and <b>say: Just as</b> it atones only for <b>acts of rebellion that are never subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering, so too,</b> it atones, or suspends punishment, only for <b>sins that are never</b> and will never be <b>subject to</b> atonement through <b>an offering? And what</b> types of transgressions <b>are they?</b> They are in cases where one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end. But where he had awareness at the beginning but did not have awareness at the end, since when he becomes aware, he</b> is <b>subject to an offering,</b> one could <b>say</b> that the goat <b>will not</b> even <b>suspend</b> his punishment.
<b>And if you would say</b> that the comparison should not be understood in this way, because for one who <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end,</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>and Yom Kippur</b> itself <b>atone,</b> that is difficult. If atonement is achieved through them, it is unnecessary for the verse to teach that atonement is not effected by the internal goat. Perforce, the comparison must be understood as the <i>baraita</i> presents it. What then is the difficulty of the <i>baraita</i>?
The Gemara explains: It could <b>enter your mind to say that we should reverse</b> our conclusions about which offering atones for which type of transgression. In other words, one could say that the internal goat atones for the sin of one who did not have awareness at the beginning and the external goat atones for the sin of one who did have awareness at the beginning. If so, the comparison could be fully extended, as the Gemara suggested, and accordingly one could have thought that the internal goat would not atone for one who had awareness at the beginning. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “For all their sins,”</b> which indicates <b>by inference</b> that the internal goat atones only for <b>those who are</b> potentially <b>liable to</b> bring <b>a sin-offering,</b> i.e., the sliding-scale offering, should they become aware of their sin.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But let</b> one who is still not aware of his transgression <b>achieve complete atonement,</b> so that even should he later become aware of his transgression, he will not have to bring an offering. Why does the <i>baraita</i> say that the goat only suspends the punishment? The Gemara answers: <b>If it were written: From their sins,</b> it would be interpreted <b>as you say,</b> but <b>now that it is written: “For all their sins,”</b> this indicates that it is referring <b>to those</b> sins <b>whose</b> commission will potentially cause the transgressor to <b>become subject to</b> an obligation to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But once</b> it has been determined <b>that</b> the goat <b>does not effect</b> complete <b>atonement, to what</b> end <b>does it suspend</b> punishment? <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> means <b>to say that if he dies</b> before he brings his offering, <b>he dies without</b> liability for <b>sin. Rava said to him: If he dies,</b> he does not need the offering to atone for him, since <b>death</b> itself <b>cleanses him</b> of all his sins. <b>Rather, Rava said</b> there is a different explanation: The <i>baraita</i> means to say that the goat serves <b>to protect him from</b> being punished with <b>suffering</b> before he has brought his offering.
§ The mishna teaches: For cases in which one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but had awareness at the end,</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed outside</b> the Sanctuary, i.e., the goat of the additional offerings of Yom Kippur, <b>and Yom Kippur</b> itself, <b>atone.</b> This is derived from the fact that the Torah juxtaposes the internal and external goats to teach that both atone only for cases in which one had awareness of his transgression at some point, although each offering atones in a different case.
The Gemara comments: <b>Now,</b> the verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the two goats <b>with each other</b> to teach that they effect atonement for similar cases. <b>But</b> then <b>let the internal</b> goat <b>atone</b> both <b>for itself,</b> i.e., for the cases that it normally atones for, <b>and for that which</b> the <b>external</b> goat normally atones for, <b>and</b> the practical <b>difference</b> will be in a case <b>where,</b> for some reason, the service of the <b>external</b> goat <b>was not performed.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The verse states:</b> “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners <b>once</b> a year; with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement once in the year shall he make atonement for it throughout your generations” (Exodus 30:10). The emphasis of the repeated term “once” teaches that the goat <b>effects one atonement</b> for only one case <b>but cannot effect two atonements</b> for two different cases.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> then <b>let</b> the <b>external</b> goat <b>atone</b> both <b>for itself,</b> i.e., for the cases that it normally atones for, <b>and for that which</b> the <b>internal</b> goat normally <b>does</b> atone for, and the practical <b>difference</b> will be in a case <b>of</b> the <b>defiling</b> of the Temple or sacrificial foods <b>that occurred between</b> the offering of <b>this</b> goat <b>and that</b> goat. If it occurs after the internal goat’s blood presentation, then the external goat will effect atonement for it. The Gemara explains: <b>The verse states:</b> “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners <b>once a year”</b> (Exodus 30:10). The emphasis on the term “once a year” teaches that <b>this atonement,</b> for the specific case that it atones for, <b>should be</b>

Daf 9a

<b>only once a year.</b>
According to the mishna, the internal goat atones for a case in which there was no awareness at the beginning but there was awareness at the end. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Yishmael, who says:</b> For a case <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end,</b> that person <b>is liable to</b> bring <b>an offering, for what does</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>atone?</b> The Gemara answers: It atones <b>for</b> a case <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness,</b> neither <b>in the beginning, nor in the end.</b>
The Gemara challenges this answer: But for <b>that</b> case, <b>the goats of the Festivals and the goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says:</b> The <b>atonement effected by all the goats</b> offered as part the additional offerings, i.e., those of the New Moons, the Festivals, and Yom Kippur, <b>is the same:</b> They all atone <b>for</b> various cases of the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if Rabbi Yishmael holds that the internal goat atones for a situation in which there was no awareness at all, <b>with regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> does the Torah <b>juxtapose</b> the <b>internal</b> goat <b>with</b> the <b>external</b> goat? The Gemara explains: The juxtaposition teaches that <b>just as</b> the <b>internal</b> goat <b>does not atone for other transgressions, so too,</b> the <b>external</b> goat <b>does not atone for other transgressions.</b> Rather, they both atone only for the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>For</b> the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness,</b> neither <b>at the beginning nor at the end, the goats</b> brought as sin-offerings as part of the additional offerings <b>of the Festivals and the goats</b> brought as sin-offerings as part of the additional offerings <b>of</b> the <b>New Moons atone.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states</b> with regard to additional offerings of the New Moons: <b>“And one goat for a sin-offering to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 28:15). The final phrase, which literally means: A sin to the Lord, alludes to the fact that <b>this goat atones</b> for <b>a sin of which only the Lord is aware,</b> i.e., where there was no awareness either at the beginning or at the end.
The Gemara objects: <b>But this</b> phrase <b>is necessary</b> in order <b>to</b> expound it <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish says: What is different</b> about the <b>goat</b> brought as a sin-offering <b>of</b> the <b>New Moon that</b> it <b>is stated with regard to it: “To the Lord,”</b> a term not written with regard to other sin-offerings? <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, says,</b> as it were: <b>This goat shall be an atonement for</b> the fact <b>that I diminished</b> the size of <b>the moon.</b>
The Gemara resolves the problem: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the phrase was needed only for that statement, <b>let the verse state</b> only: A sin-offering <b>for the Lord.</b> For <b>what</b> reason does it state: <b>“To the Lord”?</b> In order <b>to</b> expound it <b>in accordance with that which we have said,</b> that it atones only for a sin that the Lord alone is aware of.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the <b>whole of</b> the phrase <b>comes</b> exclusively <b>to</b> teach <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i>, and not to expound it in accordance with Reish Lakish’s statement at all? The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the verse state: A sin-offering of the Lord.</b> For <b>what</b> reason does it state: <b>“To the Lord”? You</b> can <b>conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> the goat <b>atone even for other transgressions</b> that a person never became aware of. Why does Rabbi Yehuda limit the scope of its atonement? The Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Since this</b> goat of the New Moon <b>is brought at a fixed time, and that</b> goat of Yom Kippur <b>is brought at a fixed time,</b> they must atone for similar transgressions. <b>Just as that</b> goat of Yom Kippur <b>atones only for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>so too, this</b> goat of the New Moon <b>atones only for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods.
The Gemara says: <b>We found</b> a source teaching that the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons</b> atone for the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods. <b>From where do we</b> derive that the <b>goats of the Festivals</b> also atone for such cases? <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>this</b> can <b>also</b> be derived <b>in accordance with that</b> which the Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught,</b> that suggestion <b>can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>If</b> you try to derive it <b>through</b> a comparison to the goats <b>of</b> the <b>New Moon,</b> the comparison is flawed, <b>as</b> those goats are more <b>frequent</b> than those of the Festivals. And <b>if</b> you try to derive it <b>through</b> a comparison to the goat <b>of Yom Kippur,</b> that comparison is also flawed, <b>as</b> that goat <b>has</b> a more <b>extensive atonement,</b> since it atones for all sins. <b>And if you would say:</b>

Daf 9b

<b>Don’t we derive</b> the atonement of the goat of the <b>New Moon through</b> a comparison to the goat <b>of Yom Kippur and we did not refute it</b> by saying that the atonement of the goat of Yom Kippur is more extensive, that is not relevant: <b>There,</b> with regard to the goat of the New Moon, the basic fact that it provides <b>atonement is written</b> in the verse, as Rav Yehuda explains above, and the comparison to the goat of Yom Kippur is <b>merely revealing a matter,</b> i.e., it teaches in what way its atonement is limited. <b>But here,</b> with regard to the goats of the Festivals, the verse does not mention any details about atonement, so <b>it is</b> valid <b>to say</b> that <b>we do not derive the entire matter</b> from the comparison to the goat of Yom Kippur, as it provides a more extensive atonement.
<b>Rather,</b> the atonement of the goats of the Festivals is derived just <b>as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says</b> in explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Meir (10a): The matter is derived from the fact that with regard to the goat of the Festivals (see Numbers, chapters 28–29) the verses that mention the goat could have simply stated: <b>A goat,</b> but instead state: <b>“And a goat.” Here too,</b> the fact that the verse could have simply stated: <b>A goat,</b> but instead states: <b>“And a goat,”</b> indicates that the <b>goats of</b> the <b>Festivals are juxtaposed with</b> the <b>goat of the New Moon,</b> which are mentioned at the beginning of that passage, and teaches that they all effect a similar atonement. <b>Just as</b> the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moon atone only for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end, so too,</b> the <b>goats of the Festivals atone only for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>When Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the goats of the New Moons and the Festivals atone <b>for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end,</b> does <b>that statement</b> apply only <b>to a sin that will never eventually become known,</b> e.g., where no one was present when the person became ritually impure, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>a sin that will eventually become known,</b> it is considered to be <b>like</b> a case of <b>one who has awareness</b> of his sin <b>at the end, and</b> therefore only the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>and Yom Kippur</b> itself <b>atone</b> for it? <b>Or perhaps, even</b> with regard to <b>a sin that will eventually become known,</b> right <b>now, at least,</b> before it becomes known, <b>I can call it a sin of which only God is aware,</b> and therefore the goats of the New Moons and the Festivals atone for it.
The Gemara concludes: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of this dilemma, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For</b> a case <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end, and</b> it is <b>a sin that will eventually become known,</b> the <b>goats of the Festivals and</b> the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The <b>goats of the Festivals atone</b> for a case in which one never had awareness of his transgression, <b>but</b> the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons</b> do <b>not.</b> Rather, the latter atone for a ritually pure person who unwittingly partook of ritually impure sacrificial food.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon? The verse states: “And He gave it to you to bear the sin of the congregation”</b> (Leviticus 10:17), <b>and this verse is written with regard to</b> the <b>goat of</b> the <b>New Moon. And</b> its capacity to atone <b>is derived from the frontplate</b> through a verbal analogy between the words <b>“sin”</b> in this verse, and the word <b>“sin”</b> stated with regard to the frontplate. The verse there states: “And it shall be on Aaron’s forehead and Aaron will bear the sin of the sacred offerings” (Exodus 28:38). The verbal analogy teaches as follows: <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to the goat of the New Moon: <b>“Sin,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to the frontplate: <b>“Sin.” Just as there,</b> in the verse in Exodus, the atonement is for a sin involving the <b>ritual impurity of</b> sacrificial <b>meat,</b> i.e., where such meat is placed on the altar, <b>so too here,</b> in the verse in Leviticus, the atonement is for a sin involving the <b>ritual impurity of</b> sacrificial <b>meat,</b> i.e., where a ritually pure person partakes of it.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the two cases are to be compared, then one could take the comparison further: <b>Just as there,</b> in the verse in Exodus, the atonement is only for meat that <b>ascends</b> upon the altar, <b>so too here,</b> in the verse in Leviticus, the atonement is only for meat that <b>ascends</b> upon the altar. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: It <b>is written</b> with regard to the goat of the New Moon: “To bear <b>the sin of the congregation.”</b> This indicates that it atones for the personal sin of partaking of sacrificial meat that was to be consumed by an individual, which became ritually impure.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Now,</b> the atonement of the goats of the New Moon and that of the frontplate <b>are derived from one another</b> by a verbal analogy. If so, <b>let</b> the goat <b>of</b> the <b>New Moon atone for itself,</b> i.e., for the cases that it normally atones for, <b>and for that which the frontplate</b> normally atones for, and the practical <b>difference</b> will be in a case <b>where the frontplate was broken.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the goat of the New Moon: “To bear <b>the sin</b> of the congregation,” which indicates that <b>it bears,</b> i.e., atones for, only <b>one sin, but</b> it <b>does not bear two sins.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>But let</b> the <b>frontplate atone for itself,</b> i.e., for those cases that it normally atones for, <b>and for</b> that which the goats <b>of</b> the <b>New Moon</b> normally atone for, and the practical <b>difference</b> will be in a case of the <b>defiling</b> of the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>that occurred between</b> the goat offering of <b>this</b> New Moon <b>and that</b> New Moon which follows. The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to the goat of the New Moon: “And He gave <b>it</b> to you to bear the sin of the congregation,” which indicates that <b>it bears,</b> i.e., atones for, that <b>sin, but another does not bear</b> that <b>sin.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi states</b> another proof for the opinion that each atones in a different case: <b>It is stated here</b> with regard to the goat of the New Moon: <b>“The sin of the congregation,”</b> which indicates that it atones for the sin of the <b>congregation, but not</b> for <b>the</b> sin involving <b>sacred offerings. And there,</b> with regard to the frontplate, <b>it is written: “The sin of the sacred offerings,”</b> which indicates that it atones for the sin involving <b>sacred offerings, but not</b> for the sin of the <b>congregation.</b>
The Gemara says: <b>We found</b> a source for Rabbi Shimon’s opinion about the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons, that they atone for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food. <b>From where do we</b> derive his opinion about the <b>goats of</b> the <b>Festivals, that they atone for</b> cases of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end?</b>
The Gemara answers: It is derived just <b>as Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says,</b> in explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Meir (10a): The fact that with regard to the goat of the Festivals the verses that mention the goats could have simply stated: <b>A goat,</b> but instead state: <b>“And a goat,”</b> teaches that the goats of the Festivals effect an atonement similar to that of the goat of the New Moon that is mentioned at the beginning of that passage. <b>Here too,</b> the fact that the verse could have simply stated: <b>A goat,</b> but instead states: <b>“And a goat,”</b> teaches that the goats of the Festivals effect an atonement similar to that of the goat of the New Moon, which is mentioned at the beginning of that passage.

Daf 10a

<b>And</b> through this additional “and,” the <b>goats of</b> the <b>Festivals are juxtaposed with</b> the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons,</b> indicating that <b>just as</b> the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone for a case involving sacrificial</b> food, i.e., where a ritually pure person partook of ritually impure sacrificial food, <b>so too,</b> the <b>goats of the Festivals atone for</b> a similar <b>case involving sacrificial</b> food, i.e., where a ritually impure person partook of ritually pure sacrificial food.
<b>And if you would say: Let</b> the goats of the Festivals <b>atone for</b> that which the goats <b>of</b> the <b>New Moon</b> are sacrificed, that is not possible. <b>Didn’t we say</b> above that the verse states with regard to the goat of the New Moon: “And He gave <b>it</b> to you to bear the sin of the congregation,” which indicates that <b>it bears,</b> i.e., atones for, that <b>sin but another does not bear</b> that <b>sin?</b>
<b>And if you would say: Let</b> the goats of the Festivals <b>atone for</b> that which the goat <b>of Yom Kippur</b> is brought, that is not possible. <b>Didn’t we say</b> above that the verse states with regard to the goat of Yom Kippur: “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners <b>once a year”</b> (Exodus 30:10)? The emphasis on “once a year” teaches that <b>this atonement</b> for this case <b>should be only once a year.</b>
The Gemara explains: It must be that the goats of the Festivals atone for cases of defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods in which one did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end, because if not, <b>for what</b> other matter involving sacrificial foods <b>could they atone?</b>
<b>If</b> you say they atone <b>for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning and had awareness at the end,</b> then one can counter <b>that he is liable to</b> bring <b>an offering</b> to atone for his transgression, and therefore the goats of the Festivals will not atone for him. <b>If</b> you say they atone <b>for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>had awareness at the beginning but did not have awareness at the end,</b> then one can counter <b>that</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>and Yom Kippur</b> itself <b>suspend</b> any punishment that he deserves until he becomes aware of his transgression. <b>If</b> you say they atone <b>for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end,</b> then one can counter <b>that</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>atones.</b>
<b>Perforce,</b> they <b>atone only for</b> cases in <b>which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The <b>atonement</b> effected by <b>all the goats</b> offered as part of the additional offerings, i.e., those of the New Moons, Festivals, and Yom Kippur, <b>is the same.</b> They all atone for various cases of the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods.
<b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Meir?</b> With regard to the goat of the Festivals (Numbers, chapters 28–29) <b>the verse</b> could have simply <b>stated: A goat,</b> but instead it states: <b>“And a goat,”</b> which teaches that <b>all the goats are juxtaposed, this</b> one <b>with that</b> one, as the use of the term <b>“and”</b> teaches that the second matter <b>adds to the first matter,</b> and that all the goats effect a similar atonement as the first one listed, that of the New Moon.
The Gemara questions this interpretation: Initially <b>it enters your mind</b> to explain that the atonement effected by <b>each and every one</b> of the goats of the Festivals is <b>derived from</b> the atonement effected by the goat <b>adjacent to it,</b> i.e., the one mentioned in the passage immediately preceding it: The atonement effected by the Passover goat from the atonement effected by the goat of the New Moon and the atonement effected by the <i>Shavuot</i> goat from the atonement effected by the Passover goat and so forth. <b>But</b> this is difficult, as <b>doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say:</b> With regard to <b>the entire Torah,</b> one <b>derives</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>derived</b> via a juxtaposition <b>from</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>derived</b> via a juxtaposition, <b>except for</b> <i>halakhot</i> concerning <b>consecrated</b> matters, <b>where</b> one <b>does not derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>derived</b> via a juxtaposition <b>from</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>derived</b> via a juxtaposition?
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> because actually the atonement effected by <b>all of</b> the goats <b>is derived</b> directly <b>from</b> the atonement effected by <b>the first</b> goat, i.e., the goat of the New Moon.
The Gemara asks: Rabbi Ḥama bar Rabbi Ḥanina’s explanation <b>works out well</b> for <b>all</b> the goats <b>with regard to which it is written: “And a goat,”</b> but <b>from where do we</b> derive what the goats of <b><i>Shavuot</i> and Yom Kippur</b> atone for, <b>as with regard to them it is not written: And a goat,</b> but simply: “A goat”?
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yona says: The verse states</b> at the end of the passage detailing the goats of the Festivals: <b>“These shall you offer to the Lord on your Festivals”</b> (Numbers 29:39); with this verse <b>all</b> the goats of <b>the Festivals are juxtaposed, this</b> one <b>with that</b> one, which indicates that they all atone for the same sins. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the <b>New Moon is not</b> regarded as <b>a Festival.</b>
The Gemara refutes this: In <b>truth,</b> the <b>New Moon is also called a Festival, in accordance with what Abaye says</b> with regard to a different issue, <b>as Abaye says:</b> With regard to the month of <b>Tammuz</b> in <b>that year</b> during which the Jewish people sinned by accepting the slanderous report of the spies about Eretz Yisrael, the court <b>made it a full</b> month of thirty days, <b>as it is written: “He proclaimed a festival to crush my young men”</b> (Lamentations 1:15). Abaye understands the verse to mean that by extending the month of Tammuz by an extra day, by proclaiming that the thirtieth day should be celebrated as a New Moon in addition to the first day of the following month, it emerged that the acceptance of the spies’ report occurred on the ninth of Av, and not the eighth, thereby defining the ninth of Av as an ominous day for the Jewish people. From Abaye’s explanation it is apparent that the New Moon is also called a Festival.
The Gemara continues to analyze Rabbi Meir’s opinion: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And</b> even though he holds that all the goats offered as part of the additional offerings effect atonement for the same sin, <b>Rabbi Meir concedes with regard to</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur <b>that it does not atone their atonement,</b> i.e., does not atone for the sins that they atone for, <b>and they do not atone its atonement.</b>
He elaborates: <b>It does not atone their atonement,</b> because, as the Gemara derived from the verse: “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners once a year” (Exodus 30:10), the internal goat <b>effects one atonement</b> for only one case <b>but cannot effect two atonements</b> for two different cases. And <b>they do not atone its atonement,</b> because, as the Gemara explained, <b>the verse states:</b> “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners <b>once a year.”</b> The emphasis on the phrase “once a year” teaches that <b>this atonement</b> for the specific case that it atones for <b>should be only once a year.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>This</b> qualification of Rabbi Meir’s opinion <b>is also</b> indicated by that which is <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For</b> cases of the defiling of the Temple <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end, and for</b> cases <b>in which</b> one <b>did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end, and for a ritually pure person who partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food, the <b>goats of the Festivals and</b> the <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons and</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed outside</b> the Sanctuary <b>atone.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>But</b> in delineating which offerings atone, Rabbi Meir <b>omitted</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>and</b> furthermore, when delineating <b>their atonement,</b> i.e., what cases they atone for, <b>he also omitted it,</b> i.e., he did not mention the cases that the internal goat atones for, which are the cases in which one had awareness at the beginning but did not have awareness at the end. Evidently, the atonement of the internal goat is substantively different from the atonement of the other goats.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Shimon would say:</b> The <b>goats of</b> the <b>New Moons atone for a ritually pure</b> person <b>who</b> unwittingly <b>partook of ritually impure</b> sacrificial food. And for defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods, the goats of the Festivals atone for cases in which one did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end, and the goats of the additional offerings of Yom Kippur atone for cases in which one did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end.
The Gemara challenges: <b>Granted,</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>New Moons do not atone for</b> that which the goats <b>of Festivals</b> atone, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to the goat of the New Moon: “And he gave it to you to bear the <b>sin</b> of the congregation” (Leviticus 10:17), which indicates that <b>it bears,</b> i.e., atones for, <b>one sin but does not bear two sins. But</b> nevertheless, <b>let</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals atone for</b> that which the goats <b>of New Moons atone.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states:</b> “He gave <b>it</b> to you.” The emphasis on “it” teaches that <b>it bears</b> this <b>sin, but no other</b> offering <b>bears</b> this <b>sin.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>Granted,</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals do not atone for</b> that which the goats <b>of Yom Kippur</b> atone, <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to the goat of Yom Kippur: “Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners <b>once a year”</b> (Exodus 30:10). The emphasis on the phrase “once a year” teaches that <b>this atonement,</b> i.e., the specific case it atones for, <b>should be only once a year. But</b> nevertheless, <b>let</b> the goats <b>of Yom Kippur atone for</b> that which the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals</b> atone. The Gemara responds: <b>The verse states: “Once</b> a year,” which indicates that it <b>effects one atonement</b> for only one case <b>but cannot effect two atonements</b> for two different cases.
The Gemara challenges the use of these derivations: <b>But when it states “once”</b> in this verse, <b>it is with regard to</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>that it is written,</b> so the derivations from it should have no bearing on the discussion concerning the external goat. The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “One goat for a sin-offering <b>aside from</b>

Daf 10b

<b>the sin-offering of the atonements”</b> (Numbers 29:11). “One goat for a sin-offering” is referring to the external goat, and “the sin-offering of the atonements” is referring to the internal goat. With this verse, the <b>external</b> goat <b>is juxtaposed with</b> the <b>internal</b> goat, and therefore the limitations imposed on the atonement of the internal goat are also to be applied to the external goat.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of</b> Rabbi Shimon a version of his opinion that differs from that of the mishna above: The goats of the New Moons atone for a ritually pure person who unwittingly partook of ritually impure sacrificial food. The goats of the Festivals exceed them, as they atone both for a ritually pure person who partook of ritually impure sacrificial food and also atone for cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods where one did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end. The goats of Yom Kippur further exceed them, as they atone both for a ritually pure person who partook of ritually impure sacrificial food and for cases of defiling the Temple or its sacrificial foods in which one did not have awareness, neither at the beginning nor at the end; and they also atone for cases in which one did not have awareness at the beginning but did have awareness at the end.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about the goats <b>of</b> the <b>New Moons that they do not atone for that which</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals</b> atone? The Gemara answers: <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to any one of the goats of the New Moons: “And He gave it to you to bear <b>the sin</b> of the congregation” (Leviticus 10:17), which teaches that <b>it bears,</b> i.e., atones for, <b>one sin but does not bear two sins.</b> The Gemara asks: If so, the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals should also not atone for that which</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>New Moons</b> atone, <b>as</b> that same <b>verse states:</b> “And He gave <b>it</b> to you,” which indicates that <b>it bears,</b> i.e., atones for, that <b>sin, but nothing</b> else <b>bears</b> that <b>sin.</b> Why then does Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda cite Rabbi Shimon as holding that the goats of the Festivals do atone for that which the goats of the New Moons atone? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon <b>does not learn</b> anything from the word <b>“it.”</b> Accordingly, he holds that any one of the goats of the Festivals can atone for two different sins.
The Gemara asks further: <b>What is different</b> about the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals that they do not atone for that which</b> the goats <b>of Yom Kippur</b> atone? <b>As the verse states</b> with regard to the goat of Yom Kippur: <b>“Once a year”</b> (Exodus 30:10), which teaches that <b>this atonement</b> for the specific case that it atones for <b>should be only once a year,</b> and therefore no other offering can atone for it. The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> the goats <b>of Yom Kippur should also not atone for that which</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals</b> atone, as it <b>is written: “Once</b> a year,” which teaches that the goats <b>effect one atonement</b> for only one case <b>but cannot effect two atonements</b> for two cases. Why then does Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda cite Rabbi Shimon as holding that the goats of Yom Kippur atone for everything that the goats of the Festivals atone for? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Shimon <b>does not learn</b> anything from the word <b>“once.”</b> Accordingly, he holds that the goats of Yom Kippur can atone for three different cases.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> doesn’t he expound the word “once”? He does not expound it <b>because when</b> the word <b>“once” is written,</b> it <b>is written with regard to</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, and so the <i>halakha</i> derived from that verse has no bearing on the capacity of the goat whose blood presentation is performed outside the Sanctuary to atone. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the goats <b>of</b> the <b>Festivals also should atone for that which</b> the goats <b>of Yom Kippur</b> atone, <b>as when</b> the phrase <b>“once</b> a year” <b>is written,</b> it <b>is written with regard to</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, so the <i>halakha</i> derived from that verse has no bearing on whether another offering can atone for that which the external goat atones.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, he does learn</b> a <i>halakha</i> from the word <b>“once,”</b> and he holds that it also teaches about the capacity of the external goat to atone, as the Gemara explained above. <b>But</b> it <b>is different here,</b> with regard to the derivation that the goat cannot effect two atonements, <b>as the verse states: “And Aaron shall bring atonement upon its corners once a year”</b> (Exodus 30:10). The emphasis on “upon its corners” teaches that it is only with regard to the internal goat, whose blood presentation is performed upon the <b>corners of the internal altar, that it effects one atonement</b> for only one case <b>but cannot effect two atonements</b> for two different cases, <b>but</b> the external goat, whose blood presentation is performed upon the corners <b>of the external</b> altar, can effect <b>even two</b> different <b>atonements.</b>
§ Animals purchased with funds collected for public offerings may be sacrificed only during the fiscal year in which those funds were given. For this purpose, the fiscal year begins on the first of Nisan. Generally, once an animal has been consecrated as an offering, then even if for some reason it may no longer be sacrificed, it still cannot be redeemed unless it develops a blemish. Rabbi Yoḥanan teaches an exception to this <i>halakha</i>: <b>Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Lambs consecrated for the <b>daily offerings that were not needed by the public</b> during the fiscal year in which they were purchased <b>are redeemed,</b> even if they are <b>unblemished,</b> and they may then be used for non-sacred purposes.
<b>Rabba was sitting and reciting this <i>halakha</i>. Rav Ḥisda said to him: Who will listen to you and Rabbi Yoḥanan, your teacher,</b> with regard to this <i>halakha</i>? Rav Ḥisda clarified: <b>But</b> the <b>sanctity that was</b> inherent <b>in them, to where has it gone?</b> Since these animals were consecrated as offerings, they should have been endowed with inherent sanctity. Only sanctity that inheres in an item’s value, i.e., an item consecrated to the Temple treasury, can be desacralized through redemption, but an item with inherent sanctity can never be desacralized.
Rabba <b>said to him: Don’t you</b> also <b>hold that we do not say</b> that the question: The <b>sanctity that was</b> inherent <b>in them, to where has it gone,</b> poses a difficulty? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:5): In any fiscal year, one may use only incense that was purchased with funds collected for that year. Accordingly, the mishna asks: With regard to <b>the surplus incense</b> that remained unused at the end of the fiscal year, <b>what would</b> the Temple treasurers <b>do with it</b> in order to render it usable for the following year? They would <b>separate from</b> the Temple treasury the <b>wages for the artisans</b> who worked for the Temple, and those funds would thereby be desacralized. <b>And</b> then <b>they would desacralize</b> the surplus incense by transferring its sanctity <b>to</b> that <b>money</b> that had been set aside <b>for the artisans.</b> Then, <b>they would give</b> the now-desacralized incense <b>to the artisans as their wages, and</b> finally, <b>they would repurchase it</b> with funds <b>from the new collection</b> carried out for the coming year.
Rabba explains the proof from the mishna: One could ask: <b>But why</b> should the method described work? <b>Let us say:</b> The <b>sanctity that was</b> inherent <b>in</b> the incense, <b>to where has it gone?</b> It cannot be removed by redeeming it. Perforce, even you must concede that this question does not pose a difficulty.
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: Did you say</b> that there is a proof from the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>incense?</b> One cannot compare incense to animals consecrated for the daily offerings, since <b>incense is different,</b>

Daf 11a

<b>as it</b> has only <b>sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value.</b> By contrast, animal offerings have inherent sanctity, which cannot be removed.
Rabba challenges Rav Ḥisda’s claim about incense: <b>If that is so, it should not become disqualified through</b> contact with <b>one</b> who was ritually impure <b>who immersed that day</b> but is still not regarded as fully pure until nightfall, as only items with inherent sanctity are disqualified in such a way. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the incense: Once the priest has <b>placed it in a mortar</b> to grind it, it <b>can be disqualified through</b> contact with <b>one who immersed that day?</b>
Rabba deflects a possible challenge: <b>And if you would say</b> to defend your opinion that <b>all</b> items that have <b>sanctity</b> that inheres in their <b>value are</b> also <b>disqualified through</b> contact with <b>one who immersed that day,</b> that is not so. He explains: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 9a): With regard to the ingredients of <b>the meal-offerings,</b> one is liable for <b>misusing them from when they are consecrated</b> with sanctity that inheres in their value by the owner verbally dedicating them to the Temple? Once they are further <b>consecrated</b> with inherent sanctity by being placed <b>in</b> a service <b>vessel, they become fit to be disqualified</b> both <b>through</b> contact with <b>one who immersed that day, and through</b> contact with <b>one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering to complete the purification process, <b>and through being left overnight.</b>
Rabba explains the proof: From this mishna it is apparent that if the ingredients of the meal-offerings <b>were consecrated</b> with inherent sanctity by being placed <b>in</b> a service <b>vessel,</b> then, <b>yes,</b> they can been disqualified through contact with one who immersed that day, but if <b>they were not consecrated</b> by being placed <b>in</b> a service <b>vessel,</b> then they will <b>not</b> be disqualified through contact with one who immersed that day, as they have only sanctity that inheres in their value.
Rav Ḥisda responds: <b>Rather, what</b> do you say? Do you say that the surplus incense, which was only placed in a mortar but never in a service vessel, has <b>inherent sanctity?</b> But <b>if that is so, it should be disqualified by being left overnight. Why,</b> then, <b>did we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 10a): With regard to <b>the handful</b> of the meal-offering that the priest takes to burn on the altar, <b>the frankincense, the incense, the meal-offering of priests, the meal-offering of the anointed priest,</b> i.e., High Priest, <b>and the meal-offering of libations,</b> one is liable for <b>misusing them from when they are consecrated</b> by verbally dedicating them for their purposes. Once they are further <b>consecrated</b> with inherent sanctity by being placed <b>in</b> a service <b>vessel, they become fit to be disqualified</b> both <b>through</b> contact with <b>one who immersed that day, and through</b> contact with <b>one who has not yet</b> brought <b>an atonement</b> offering to complete the purification process, <b>and through being left overnight.</b>
Rav Ḥisda explains the proof: From this mishna it is apparent that if these items <b>were consecrated</b> with inherent sanctity by being placed <b>in</b> a service <b>vessel,</b> then <b>yes,</b> they can been disqualified by being left overnight, but if <b>they were not consecrated</b> by being placed <b>in</b> a service <b>vessel,</b> then they will <b>not</b> be disqualified by being left overnight, as they have only sanctity that inheres in their value. Apparently, even after the incense has been placed in the mortar, it still does not have inherent sanctity.
Rabba <b>said to him: Did you say</b> that you can provide a proof from the disqualification that occurs as a result of an item’s being <b>left overnight?</b> One cannot do so, as <b>incense is different,</b> because even though it has inherent sanctity, it is not disqualified by being left overnight, <b>since its form</b> remains unchanged <b>throughout the entire year,</b> and the disqualification brought about by being left overnight applies only to a substance that spoils over time.
The Gemara notes: <b>In any case,</b> Rav Ḥisda’s initial question is still <b>difficult: But</b> the <b>sanctity that was</b> inherent <b>in them, to where has it gone? Rabba said:</b> With regard to the consecration of items for public offerings such as the daily offerings and incense, the <b>court tacitly stipulates concerning them</b> as follows: <b>If they are</b> ultimately <b>required</b> to be used as offerings that year, then <b>they are required</b> for that, and they should be consecrated as offerings. <b>But if</b> they are <b>not</b> required that year, then <b>they are</b> only to be consecrated <b>for their value,</b> i.e., for them to be sold and then for their proceeds to be used toward the purchase of offerings.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>But wasn’t it</b> you, <b>Master, who said:</b> If <b>one consecrated a male</b> ram <b>for its value,</b> since that ram is itself fit to be brought as an offering, it is automatically <b>consecrated</b> with <b>inherent sanctity?</b> Accordingly, to what avail is the court’s stipulation? Since the items are fit to be used as offerings, they will automatically become consecrated with inherent sanctity, even if they are consecrated only for their value. Rabba answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> case, where the ram is automatically consecrated with inherent sanctity, is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the donor <b>says</b> that it should be consecrated <b>for</b> the <b>value of a burnt-offering,</b> for which the ram is itself suitable, whereas <b>that</b> case, of the court’s stipulation, is analogous to a situation <b>where he says</b> that a ram should be consecrated <b>for</b> the <b>value of libations,</b> for which the ram itself is not suitable and therefore is not automatically consecrated with inherent sanctity.
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rabba’s suggestion from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the <b>bull and</b> the <b>goat of Yom Kippur that were lost, and one separated</b> and sacrificed <b>others in their stead,</b>

Daf 11b

<b>and likewise, goats</b> that were designated to atone for an act of unwitting public <b>idol worship that were lost, and one separated</b> and sacrificed <b>others in their stead,</b> in such cases, <b>all of</b> the lost animals, should they subsequently be found, <b>shall be left to die.</b> This is in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> that a sin-offering whose owner has already achieved atonement is left to die. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: They should graze until they become unfit</b> by developing a blemish, <b>and</b> then <b>they are sold and their proceeds are allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. They are not left to die, <b>because</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>a communal sin-offering is not left to die.</b>
Abaye explains his challenge: <b>But why</b> should it even be necessary to wait until the offerings develop a blemish? <b>Let us say</b> here also that the <b>court tacitly stipulates concerning them,</b> so that if it ultimately emerges that they were not needed, then they should have only sanctity that inheres in their value, and therefore it should be possible to redeem them even if they do not develop a blemish.
Rabba deflects the challenge: Did <b>you say</b> that there is a proof from the case of <b>lost</b> animals? Cases of <b>lost</b> animals <b>are different, because they are not common.</b> Therefore, the court does not stipulate concerning such an eventuality.
Abaye persists: But consider the case of a red <b>heifer, which is not common, and</b> yet <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A red <b>heifer may be redeemed for any disqualification</b> that occurs <b>to it.</b> If <b>it died, it shall be redeemed;</b> if <b>it was slaughtered</b> in an improper place, <b>it shall be redeemed;</b> if <b>another was found</b> that is <b>choicer than it, it shall be redeemed.</b> But once the priest <b>has slaughtered it</b> properly <b>on its arrangement</b> of wood on the Mount of Olives, <b>it can no longer be redeemed.</b> Presumably, the reason it may be redeemed if a choicer one is found is that the court tacitly stipulates that in such a case it should be consecrated with sanctity that inheres in its value. It is apparent that even in uncommon cases, the court makes such stipulations. Rabba rejects the proof: The red <b>heifer is different, as</b> in all cases <b>it</b> has only the <b>sanctity of</b> items consecrated for <b>Temple maintenance,</b> which inheres only in the item’s value, and so it can always be redeemed, even if still unblemished.
Abaye asks: <b>If so,</b> if <b>it died or was slaughtered,</b> how <b>can it be redeemed?</b> In order for an item to be redeemed, <b>don’t we require</b> that it first undergo the process of <b>standing and valuation?</b> The animal must be stood before a priest who then evaluates how much it should be redeemed for (see Leviticus 27:11–12), and a dead animal cannot stand. Rabba answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says:</b> Items <b>consecrated to</b> be offered on the <b>altar were included in</b> the requirement of <b>standing and appraising,</b> but items with the <b>sanctity of</b> items consecrated for <b>Temple maintenance,</b> such as the red heifer, <b>were not included in</b> the requirement of <b>standing and appraising.</b>
Abaye asks: <b>If,</b> as you claim, the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> then <b>say</b> and try to justify <b>the latter clause,</b> which states: Once the priest <b>has slaughtered it</b> properly <b>on its arrangement</b> of wood on the Mount of Olives, <b>it can no longer be redeemed.</b>
<b>And</b> this statement is not consistent with Rabbi Shimon’s opinion, as <b>isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the meat of a red <b>heifer</b> that was slaughtered properly is <b>susceptible to becoming ritually impure</b> with <b>the ritual impurity of food,</b> even though it is prohibited to partake of it in its current state, <b>since it had a time when it was fit</b> to be eaten. <b>And</b> in explanation of when it was fit to be eaten, <b>Reish Lakish says: Rabbi Shimon would say</b> that a red <b>heifer may be redeemed</b> even while it is <b>upon its arrangement</b> of wood. It is considered fit to be eaten due to the potential to redeem it, which would allow one to then partake of it. It is apparent from Reish Lakish’s comment that the latter clause, and by logical extension, the rest of the <i>baraita</i>, is not in accordance with Rabbi Shimon’s opinion.
Rabba concedes therefore that the red heifer can be redeemed due to the fact that the court makes a stipulation with regard to it, but, nevertheless, he defends his opinion that they do not normally make a stipulation for uncommon cases: <b>Rather,</b> the case of a red <b>heifer is different, since it is of great monetary value.</b> Therefore, to avoid a great loss, the court makes a stipulation despite its being an uncommon case.
The Gemara interjects with a question concerning the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If a red heifer <b>died, it shall be redeemed.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But may one redeem consecrated</b> items <b>in order to feed</b> the meat from <b>them to dogs?</b> Certainly one may not. Nevertheless, the meat of a red heifer that died without being slaughtered is not suitable for any other purpose. <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said:</b> It is redeemed <b>for the sake of its hide.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But does the court stand and stipulate with</b> its <b>mind on the hide</b> of the heifer, which is presumably of little value? <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> As <b>people say</b> in a popular adage: <b>From a camel,</b> even just <b>its ear.</b> Since a camel is so valuable, even the flesh of its ear is valuable and should be saved if possible. Similarly, the hide of a red heifer will also be valuable.
§ Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> Rabba’s claim that the court tacitly stipulates concerning items consecrated for public offerings from the mishna (2b): The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Shimon: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>whether</b> goats consecrated for different days <b>may be sacrificed, this</b> one <b>in</b> place of <b>that</b> one? For example, if a goat was initially consecrated to be sacrificed as part of the Yom Kippur additional offerings, may it be sacrificed instead as part of the Festival additional offerings? Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them:</b> Such a goat <b>may be sacrificed. They said to</b> Rabbi Shimon: <b>Since,</b> according to you, <b>their atonement is not the same, how could they</b> possibly <b>be sacrificed?</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>said to them:</b> They can be interchanged, since ultimately <b>all of them come to atone for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods.
Abaye explains the objection brought from the mishna: <b>But</b> according to Rabba, <b>why</b> did Rabbi Shimon give the reason he gave? <b>Let</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>say</b> instead that the <b>court tacitly stipulates concerning them</b> that they should be consecrated for the day on which they are ultimately brought. Rabba answers: Did <b>you say</b> a proof from a statement of <b>Rabbi Shimon? Rabbi Shimon does not</b> accept the principle that the <b>court tacitly stipulates concerning them, as</b> is apparent from that which <b>Rav Idi bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Concerning lambs consecrated for the <b>daily offerings that were not needed by the public, according to the statement of Rabbi Shimon they are not redeemed</b> if they are <b>unblemished; according to the statement of the Rabbis they are redeemed,</b> even if they are <b>unblemished.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis who disagree with Rabbi Shimon</b> and hold that the court does make such stipulations, <b>who are they?</b> Where is their opinion recorded? <b>If we say</b> that they are <b>the Sages</b> who ruled, in the mishna cited above (<i>Shekalim</i> 4:5), <b>with regard to</b> surplus <b>incense</b> that it may be redeemed,

Daf 12a

no proof can be drawn from there, as <b>incense is different, as it is not</b> an entity <b>that can</b> be left to <b>graze.</b> The option that exists for animals to leave them to graze until they develop a blemish and then redeem them obviously cannot apply to incense. Therefore, it is reasonable that with regard to incense, since there is no other way to rectify it, all will concede that the court makes a stipulation.
<b>Rather,</b> say it is the opinion of <b>the Sages</b> who ruled, in the <i>baraita</i> cited above, <b>with regard to</b> the red <b>heifer</b> that it may be redeemed if a choicer one is found. The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>Perhaps</b> the case of a red <b>heifer is different, since it is of great monetary value.</b> To avoid a considerable loss, the court makes a stipulation despite it being an uncommon case.
<b>Rather,</b> say it is the opinion of <b>the Sages</b> that is introduced <b>with</b> the phrase: <b>They said to him,</b> in the mishna on 2b.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> do you know <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> referred to as the Rabbis <b>is Rabbi Yehuda and</b> that <b>this</b> is what he <b>is saying to</b> Rabbi Shimon: <b>Granted, according to my</b> opinion, <b>that I say</b> that <b>the court tacitly stipulates concerning</b> offerings that their consecration is contingent upon their eventual use, <b>it is due to this</b> reason that <b>they can be sacrificed</b> on an occasion different from the one they were initially intended for; <b>but according to your</b> opinion, <b>that you say</b> that the court does <b>not</b> make such stipulations, <b>why can they be sacrificed</b> on an occasion different from the one they were initially intended for?
<b>But perhaps</b> the <i>tanna</i> referred to as the Rabbis <b>is Rabbi Meir, and this</b> is what he <b>is saying to</b> Rabbi Shimon: <b>Granted, according to my</b> opinion, <b>that I say</b> that the <b>atonement</b> effected by <b>the goats</b> of the additional offerings of <b>all</b> three occasions, i.e., those of the New Moons, Festivals, and Yom Kippur, <b>is the same, it is due to this</b> reason that <b>they can be sacrificed</b> on an occasion different from the one they were initially intended for. <b>But according to your</b> opinion, that they effect atonement for different cases of sin, <b>why can they be sacrificed</b> on an occasion different from the one they were initially intended for? Since it cannot be demonstrated that the Rabbis’ opinion is based on the assumption that the court makes stipulations with regard to communal offerings, no proof can be drawn from the mishna.
<b>Rather,</b> the opinion of the Rabbis cited by Rabbi Yoḥanan is not necessarily recorded elsewhere, but <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan learned it through a tradition</b> that lambs consecrated for the daily offerings that were not needed by the public, <b>according to the statement of Rabbi Shimon, cannot be redeemed</b> if they are unblemished, while <b>according to the statement of the Rabbis, they may be redeemed,</b> even if they are unblemished.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who does not</b> hold that <b>the court tacitly stipulates concerning</b> those lambs that were consecrated for the daily offerings that remain unused at the end of the fiscal year, <b>what is done with them? Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One supplements</b> the offerings brought on <b>the altar with them.</b> Whenever there were no obligatory offerings to be brought upon the altar, supplementary offerings would be offered upon it in order that it should not remain idle.
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: And Rabbi Shimon concedes with regard to goats of</b> communal <b>sin-offerings</b> that were lost and for which replacements were offered in their stead, <b>that</b> even should they later be found, <b>one does not supplement</b> the offerings of the altar <b>with</b> those animals <b>themselves. Rather,</b> supplementary offerings are purchased <b>with their value,</b> i.e., the sin-offerings should be left to graze until they develop a blemish, at which point they can be sold and the proceeds used to purchase supplementary offerings.
By Torah law, both communal burnt-offerings and sin-offerings that may no longer be offered for their intended purposes may be offered as supplementary burnt-offerings. Nevertheless, Rabbi Shimon draws a distinction between the two cases: <b>Here, where from the outset</b> the animal was intended to be used as <b>a burnt-offering,</b> i.e., for the daily-offering, <b>and now</b> the intention is to use it as <b>a burnt-offering,</b> i.e., for the supplementary offerings, the animal itself may be used. <b>But there, where from the outset</b> the animal was intended to be used as <b>a sin-offering, and now</b> the intention is to use it as <b>a burnt-offering,</b> there is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> rendering prohibited the use of the animal itself even <b>after</b> its <b>atonement</b> has already been effected by a replacement sin-offering, <b>due to</b> the concern that people will confuse it with a sin-offering <b>before</b> its <b>atonement</b> has been effected by a replacement sin-offering. Such a sin-offering may be brought only for its originally intended purpose.
<b>Abaye said: We learn</b> this in a <i>baraita</i> <b>as well:</b> With regard to the <b>bull and</b> the <b>goat of Yom Kippur that were lost, and one separated</b> and sacrificed <b>others in their stead, and likewise, goats</b> that were designated to atone for an act of unwitting public <b>idol worship that were lost, and one separated</b> and sacrificed <b>others in their stead,</b> in such cases, <b>all of</b> the original animals, if they are subsequently found, <b>should be left to die.</b> This is in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> that a sin-offering whose owner has already achieved atonement is left to die. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say: They should graze until they become unfit, and</b> then <b>they are sold and their proceeds are allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. They do not need to be left to die <b>because</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>a communal sin-offering is not left to die.</b>
Abaye explains how this <i>baraita</i> supports Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak’s claim: <b>But why</b> do Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shimon say that the animal should be left to develop a blemish? <b>Let these</b> animals <b>themselves be sacrificed</b> as a supplementary <b>burnt-offering. Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the fact they did not offer this suggestion that there is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> rendering prohibited the use of the animal itself, even <b>after</b> its <b>atonement</b> has already been effected, <b>due to</b> the concern that people will confuse it with a sin-offering <b>before</b> its <b>atonement</b> has been effected?
<b>Rava said: We learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a mishna (<i>Yoma</i> 62a) <b>as well:</b> If after the lottery for the two Yom Kippur goats one of them dies, another pair is brought and a second lottery is performed. One becomes the counterpart of the remaining goat from the first pair, <b>and the second,</b> now<b>-</b>superfluous goat <b>is left to graze until it becomes unfit; and</b> then <b>it is sold and the proceeds are allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings.
Rava explains how this mishna supports Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak’s claim: <b>But why</b> should the superfluous goat be left to develop a blemish? <b>Let</b> the animal <b>itself be sacrificed</b> as a supplementary <b>burnt-offering. Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the fact that the mishna does not offer this suggestion that there is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> rendering prohibited the use of the animal itself even <b>after</b> its <b>atonement</b> has already been effected, <b>due to</b> the concern that people will confuse it with a sin-offering <b>before</b> its <b>atonement</b> has been effected?
<b>Ravina said: We learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a mishna (<i>Temura</i> 20b) <b>as well: A guilt-offering whose owner died, or</b> that was lost and before it was subsequently found <b>its owner achieved atonement</b> through a replacement guilt-offering, <b>should graze until it becomes unfit, and</b> then <b>it is sold and the proceeds are allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It should be left to die. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The owner of the guilt-offering <b>should bring a burnt-offering with the proceeds of its</b> sale.
Ravina explains how this mishna supports Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak’s claim: <b>But</b> why should it be left to develop a blemish? <b>Let this</b> animal <b>itself be sacrificed</b> as a supplementary <b>burnt-offering. Rather,</b> must one <b>not</b> conclude from the fact that the mishna does not offer this suggestion that there is a rabbinic <b>decree</b> rendering prohibited the use of the animal itself, even <b>after</b> its <b>atonement</b> has already been effected, <b>due to</b> the concern that people will confuse it with a sin-offering <b>before</b> its <b>atonement</b> has been effected? The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that there is such a rabbinic decree.
Rabbi Yoḥanan explained that Rabbi Shimon holds that lambs that were consecrated for the daily offerings that remain unused at the end of the fiscal year are offered as supplementary offerings. The Gemara notes: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> type of offerings <b>would they bring from the surplus</b> lambs that were consecrated for the daily offerings?

Daf 12b

They would bring from them <b>dessert, like white figs, for the altar.</b> The Gemara asks: Are white figs ever offered on the altar? <b>But isn’t it written: “For any leavening or fruit honey</b> you shall not cause to go up in smoke as a fire-offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 2:11)? The term “fruit honey” includes all tree fruits. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Ḥanina teaches:</b> The supplementary offerings are to the altar <b>like white figs for a person.</b>
The Gemara discusses what may be used for the supplementary offerings: <b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda taught: One does not supplement</b> the offerings of the altar <b>with a bird burnt-offering. Rava said: This</b> ruling <b>is an absurdity [<i>burkha</i>]. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: What is the absurdity?</b> The ruling has a basis. <b>I said</b> this ruling <b>to</b> Rav Naḥman, <b>and said it to him in the name of Rav Shimi of Neharde’a, as Rav Shimi of Neharde’a says: The surplus</b> lambs that were consecrated for the daily offerings <b>are allocated for communal gift</b> offerings, <b>and there is not a bird burnt-offering</b> that is offered <b>by the community.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And also Shmuel holds in accordance with this</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who taught that Rabbi Shimon holds that lambs consecrated for the daily offering that were not used are brought as supplementary offerings, even though they were not originally consecrated for that purpose, <b>as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>communal offerings,</b> their consecration serves only to define which general category of offering they are included in, e.g., whether they are a sin-offering or burnt-offering, but it is the purpose for which they are ultimately slaughtered with <b>a knife</b> that <b>defines what their</b> precise nature <b>is.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to sin-offerings: <b>And Rabbi Shimon concedes with regard to a goat</b> consecrated to be used as part of the additional offerings on the pilgrimage Festivals <b>that if it was not sacrificed on a pilgrimage Festival it can be sacrificed on a New Moon, and if was not sacrificed on a New Moon it can be sacrificed on Yom Kippur, and if it was not sacrificed on Yom Kippur it can be sacrificed on a pilgrimage Festival, and if was not sacrificed on this pilgrimage Festival, it can be sacrificed on another pilgrimage Festival.</b> This is <b>because from the outset,</b> by virtue of its consecration, <b>it came only to atone</b> by having its blood presented <b>upon the external altar,</b> but its precise nature is defined only by the purpose for which it is ultimately slaughtered.
Another <i>baraita</i> teaches the same ruling: <b>It is taught:</b> The sin-offering <b>was consecrated only to atone</b> by having its blood presented <b>upon the external altar.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And for</b> cases in which the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods was carried out <b>intentionally,</b> the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary on Yom Kippur, and Yom Kippur itself, atone. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived?
The Gemara answers: They are derived from a verse, <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the High Priest sacrificing the internal goat of Yom Kippur: <b>“And he shall effect atonement upon the Sanctuary from the impurities of the children of Israel</b> and from their acts of rebellion, for all their sins” (Leviticus 16:16). The verse is referring to two categories of sin. The first category is <b>acts of rebellion [<i>pesha’im</i>]; these are the rebellious sins, and so</b> the verse <b>states</b> that King Jehoram of Israel said to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: <b>“The king of Moab rebelled [<i>pasha</i>] against me”</b> (II Kings 3:7). <b>And</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to a rebellion against Judah: <b>“Then Libnah rebelled [<i>tifsha</i>] at that time”</b> (II Kings 8:22). The second category is <b>sins [<i>ḥataot</i>]; these are unwitting sins, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “If an individual person shall transgress [<i>teḥeta</i>] unwittingly”</b> (Leviticus 4:2).
§ The mishna teaches: <b>For</b> all <b>other transgressions that are</b> stated <b>in the Torah,</b> whether they are <b>the minor</b> ones <b>or the major</b> ones, whether they were <b>intentional or unwitting,</b> whether one became aware of them before Yom Kippur or did not become aware of them until after Yom Kippur, whether they involve a positive mitzva or a prohibition, whether the transgressors are subject to excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>], or to one of the court-imposed death penalties, the scapegoat sent to Azazel on Yom Kippur atones.
The Gemara notes that the mishna appears repetitious: <b>Minor</b> ones <b>are the same as</b> a standard <b>positive mitzva and prohibition, major</b> ones <b>are the same as</b> transgressions that are subject to <b><i>karet</i> and</b> to <b>court</b>-imposed <b>death</b> penalties, transgressions that <b>one became aware</b> of <b>are the same as intentional</b> transgressions, and transgressions that <b>one did not become aware</b> of <b>are the same as unwitting</b> transgressions.
<b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: For</b> all <b>other transgressions that are</b> stated <b>in the Torah, whether</b> they are the <b>minor</b> ones <b>or</b> the <b>major</b> ones, <b>whether they were performed unwittingly</b> or <b>whether they were performed intentionally,</b> they each have their own <i>halakhot</i>. For <b>those that were performed unwittingly,</b> in cases where there was an uncertainty whether the act was forbidden at all, atonement is effected <b>whether</b> the <b>uncertainty with regard to</b> the transgressions <b>became known to him</b> before Yom Kippur or <b>whether</b> the <b>uncertainty with regard to them did not become known to him</b> until after Yom Kippur. <b>And these are</b> the <b>minor</b> ones the mishna is referring to: A standard <b>positive mitzva and a prohibition. And these are</b> the <b>major</b> ones it is referring to: Transgressions that are subject to <b><i>karet</i> and</b> to <b>court</b>-imposed <b>death</b> penalties.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this positive mitzva</b> in the mishna? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where he did not repent,</b> the offering cannot atone for him, as the verse states: <b>“The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination”</b> (Proverbs 21:27). <b>If he did repent,</b> then why is the mishna referring to Yom Kippur? He will achieve atonement on <b>any</b> other <b>day as well, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one transgressed a positive mitzva and repented, he does not move from there until he is forgiven.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b>

Daf 13a

The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the person did not repent and <b>persists in his rebellion, and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, that even for such a case Yom Kippur and the scapegoat will atone. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: For all transgressions that are</b> stated <b>in the Torah, whether one repented,</b> or <b>whether one did not repent, Yom Kippur atones, except for one who divests</b> himself of the <b>yoke</b> of Heaven, by denying God’s existence, <b>and one who reveals facets of the Torah</b> that differ from its true meaning, <b>and one who nullifies</b> the <b>covenant of</b> circumcision of <b>the flesh. For</b> these, <b>if one repented, Yom Kippur atones, and if not, Yom Kippur does not atone.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in interpretation of the verse: “For he scorned the word of the Lord and nullified His commandment; that person will be cut off [<i>hikkaret tikkaret</i>], his sin is upon him” (Numbers 15:31): <b>“For he scorned the word of the Lord”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who divests</b> himself <b>of</b> the <b>yoke</b> of Heaven <b>and one who reveals facets of the Torah</b> that differ from its true meaning. <b>“And nullified His commandment”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who nullified the covenant of</b> circumcision of <b>the flesh.</b> The use of the double verb form <b><i>hikkaret tikkaret</i></b> teaches that <b>he will be cut off,</b> i.e., he is liable to receive <i>karet</i>, <b>before Yom Kippur, and he will</b> still <b>be cut off after Yom Kippur,</b> as Yom Kippur does not atone for him.
One <b>might</b> have thought that this applies <b>even</b> if <b>he repented.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “His sin is upon him,”</b> by which God indicates: <b>I said</b> that Yom Kippur does not atone for these sins <b>only when his sin is</b> still <b>upon him,</b> as he did not repent. It is apparent from this <i>baraita</i> that it is only for the three sins mentioned that Yom Kippur does not atone without repentance, but Yom Kippur atones for other sins even if one did not repent.
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, how do they interpret the verse? If someone commits one of the three sins mentioned, then <b>he is cut off [<i>hikkaret</i>]</b> from life <b>in this world,</b> and <b>he will be cut off [<i>tikkaret</i>] in the World-to-Come.</b> The phrase <b>“His sin is upon him”</b> teaches <b>that if he repented and died,</b> his <b>death cleanses</b> him of his sin.
The Gemara asks: <b>And can you interpret</b> the mishna to be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> by inference, <b>the first clause is also</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> but not of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches: Israelites and priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, all equally achieve atonement from the scapegoat. <b>And who accepts this reasoning? Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as the Gemara will demonstrate. <b>By inference, the first clause</b> is also in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> not of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> It is possible that the entire mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and</b> the latter clause does not pose a difficulty, because with regard to whether priests achieve atonement through the scapegoat, <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> Does <b>the Master</b> mean <b>specifically</b> what <b>he is saying,</b> i.e., that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to whether the scapegoat atones for both Israelites and priest, <b>but Rabbi Yehuda does not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi with regard to atonement for one who did not repent? <b>Or perhaps from</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> it follows that <b>Rabbi Yehuda also holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>but</b> the reason that Rav Yosef did not make this clear is that <b>he teaches the matter in the manner in which it</b> typically occurs, which is <b>to say that a disciple,</b> in this case, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>his teacher,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yehuda.
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Yes,</b> I mean <b>specifically</b> what <b>I was saying: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, but Rabbi Yehuda does not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> recorded in the <i>Sifra</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>Yom Kippur would atone for those who repent and for those who do not repent, and</b> this assertion <b>is</b> supported by the following <b>logical inference:</b> Although it would appear that <b>since a sin-offering and a guilt-offering atone and Yom Kippur atones,</b> it should follow that <b>just as a sin-offering and a guilt-offering atone only for those who repent, so too, Yom Kippur atones only for those who repent,</b> this comparison is flawed. One can claim: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a sin-offering and a guilt-offering?</b> They are notable in <b>that they do not atone for intentional</b> sins <b>like</b> they do for <b>unwitting</b> sins. <b>Can you say</b> the same <b>about Yom Kippur, which does atone for intentional</b> sins <b>as</b> it does for <b>unwitting</b> sins?
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Since</b> it is the case that the atonement of Yom Kippur is more far-reaching in that <b>it atones for intentional</b> sins <b>as</b> it does for <b>unwitting</b> sins, it follows that <b>it should atone</b> both <b>for those who repent and for those who do not repent.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “Yet</b> on the tenth day of this seventh month it is Yom Kippur” (Leviticus 23:27). The word “yet” serves to <b>divide</b> and limit the atonement of Yom Kippur in that it atones only for those who repent.
Rav Yosef attributes the <i>baraita</i> to Rabbi Yehuda: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed by the <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraitot</i> in the <b><i>Sifra</i>? Rabbi Yehuda. And he says:</b> For <b>those who repent, yes,</b> Yom Kippur atones, but for <b>those who do not repent,</b> Yom Kippur does <b>not</b> atone.
The Gemara asks: <b>But raise a contradiction,</b> setting one <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraita</i> in the <b><i>Sifra</i>,</b> i.e., the one just cited, <b>against</b> another <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraita</i> in the <b><i>Sifra</i>, as</b> in another <i>baraita</i> there <b>it is taught:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>Yom Kippur would atone only if one fasted on it and declared it a holy convocation and did not perform labor on it. From where</b> is it derived that even if <b>one did not fast on it and did not declare it a holy convocation and performed labor on it,</b> that it still atones? <b>The verse states:</b> “Yet on the tenth day of this seventh month <b>it is Yom Kippur”</b> (Leviticus 23:27). The additional emphasis on “it is” serves to teach that the day atones <b>in any case.</b> This <i>baraita</i> contradicts the one cited above that states clearly that Yom Kippur atones only for those who repent.
<b>Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult: This</b> second <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and that</b> first <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that Yom Kippur atones for those who do not repent, <b>but</b> even <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>concedes</b> that <b>with regard to</b> avoiding the punishment of <b><i>karet</i></b> incurred <b>for</b> violating <b>the day</b> of Yom Kippur, Yom Kippur atones and one is not liable to be punished with <i>karet</i> only if one repented for the sin of violating the day of Yom Kippur. Perforce he must concede this point, <b>as if you do not say so,</b> then <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>there would be no</b> instance in which one would be liable to be punished with <b><i>karet</i> for</b> violating <b>Yom Kippur.</b>
The Gemara questions this proof: <b>Why not? You</b> could <b>find it</b> in a case <b>where he performed</b> labor <b>on the night</b> of Yom Kippur <b>and died</b> that night, <b>as</b> in such a case, <b>the daytime</b> of Yom Kippur, which is the part of Yom Kippur that effects atonement, <b>never came to atone for him.</b>
<b>Rather, say</b> that Rava’s proof is as follows:

Daf 13b

It must be that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi concedes that Yom Kippur does not atone for one who violates the day itself and does not repent, as if you do not say so, <b>according to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>there would be no</b> instance in which a person would be liable to receive <b><i>karet</i> for</b> violating Yom Kippur in <b>the daytime.</b>
The Gemara questions this proof: <b>Why not? You</b> could <b>find it</b> in a case <b>where he ate a piece of meat, and</b> while he was eating <b>it choked him and he died, or</b> in a case <b>where he ate immediately before sunset</b> at the end of the day. Even if one holds that Yom Kippur does atone for violations of the day itself, in these cases it could not, <b>as there was no time</b> after the violation for the day <b>to atone for him,</b> in the first case because he was already dead, and in the second case because it was no longer Yom Kippur.
§ The mishna (2b) states: <b>Israelites and priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest,</b> i.e., the High Priest, equally achieve atone-ment. What is the difference between Israelites, priests, and the anointed priest? The difference is only that the priests achieve atonement for their defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods through the bull that the High Priest offers on Yom Kippur, whereas the Israelites achieve atonement for their transgressions through the goats that are sacrificed on Yom Kippur.
The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> mishna <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as <b>it teaches: Both Israelites and priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest</b> equally achieve atonement. <b>But then it teaches: What is</b> the difference <b>between Israelites, priests, and</b> the <b>anointed priest? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Both Israelites and priests and</b> the <b>anointed priest</b> equally <b>achieve atonement through the scapegoat for transgressions other</b> than the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, <b>and</b> in this regard <b>there is no distinction between them. But what is</b> the difference <b>between Israelites, priests, and</b> the <b>anointed priest?</b> The difference is <b>only that the bull</b> of the High Priest that he offers on Yom Kippur <b>atones for the priests for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, whereas the Israelites achieve atonement for their transgressions through the goats that are sacrificed on Yom Kippur.
<b>And whose</b> opinion is expressed by the mishna? It <b>is Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in exposition of the verse: “He shall bring atonement upon the sanctum of the sacred, and he shall effect atonement upon the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and upon the priests and upon all the people of the congregation shall he bring atonement” (Leviticus 16:33): <b>“He shall bring atonement upon the sanctum of the sacred”; this</b> is referring to <b>the innermost sanctum,</b> i.e., the Holy of Holies. “<b>Upon the Tent of Meeting”; this</b> is referring to the <b>Sanctuary.</b> “And the <b>altar”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning. “He shall effect atonement”; this</b> is referring to the Temple <b>courtyards.</b> “And upon the <b>priests”;</b> this is understood <b>in accordance with its plain meaning.</b> “And upon <b>all the people”; these are the Israelites. “Shall he bring atonement”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Levites.</b>
<b>All of them are equated with regard to</b> the fact that they are all atoned for through <b>one atonement,</b> i.e., <b>that they are atoned for by the scapegoat for</b> all <b>transgressions other</b> than the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Just as</b> the <b>blood of the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary <b>atones for Israelites for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>so too,</b> the <b>blood of the bull</b> of the High Priest, whose blood presentation is also performed inside the Sanctuary, <b>atones for the priests for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods. <b>And just as</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over the scapegoat atones for Israelites for other transgressions, so too,</b> the <b>confession</b> made <b>over</b> the <b>bull atones for the priests for other transgressions.</b> It is apparent from the <i>baraita</i> that it is only according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda that the scapegoat atones for both Israelites and priests.
The Gemara analyzes Rabbi Shimon’s opinion: <b>And according to Rabbi Shimon,</b> one can ask: <b>Weren’t</b> both Israelites and priests <b>certainly equated</b> in the verse in Leviticus? The Gemara explains: According to his opinion, in <b>what</b> way <b>are they equated</b> in the verse? They are equated in <b>that they are all subject to atonement</b> on Yom Kippur; <b>but each one</b> of the groups <b>achieves atonement in its own</b> way.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that priests are not atoned for by the scapegoat? <b>As it is written: “He shall take the two goats”</b> (Leviticus 16:7); one is used for the scapegoat and the other for the internal goat. With this verse, the <b>scapegoat is juxtaposed with the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary. It teaches that <b>just as the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside does not atone for the priests for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>as it is written with regard to</b> that goat: “The goat sin-offering <b>of the people”</b> (Leviticus 16:15), which indicates that it atones for Israelites and not for the priests, <b>so too, the scapegoat does not atone for the priests for</b> their <b>other transgressions.</b>
<b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> how does he understand the juxtaposition? He could have <b>said to you:</b> It is only <b>for this</b> reason that the goats <b>are juxtaposed:</b> The juxtaposition <b>comes</b> to teach <b>that they should be similar in appearance and in height and in value.</b> They are not similar in the atonement that they effect.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that which the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to the internal goat: <b>“He shall slaughter the goat sin-offering of the people”</b> (Leviticus 16:15); the term “of the people” excludes Aaron and the priests, and therefore indicates <b>that the priests do not achieve atonement through</b> that goat. <b>But</b> then, <b>through what do they achieve atonement?</b> Presumably, <b>through</b> the <b>bull of Aaron,</b> i.e., the bull of the High Priest.
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would</b> also <b>not achieve atonement through</b> the <b>bull of Aaron, as it is already stated:</b> “Aaron shall bring near <b>his own</b> bull sin-offering” (Leviticus 16:6), which indicates that it atones only for Aaron’s transgressions, not for the transgressions of others. And if <b>that is so,</b> then <b>they do not have</b> any means through which to achieve <b>atonement.</b> But <b>when</b> the verse <b>states: “And he shall effect atonement…upon the priests”</b> (Leviticus 16:33), <b>we have</b> clearly <b>found that they</b> do <b>have</b> a means of achieving <b>atonement.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Through which</b> means then <b>do they achieve atonement?</b> Do they achieve it through the internal goat or the bull of Aaron? It is <b>better</b> to say <b>that they achieve atonement through the bull of Aaron, as</b> in any event, <b>with regard to his household, an exception was made to its rule</b> that it atones only for Aaron, and his household also achieves atonement from his bull. It is therefore not unreasonable to say that the priesthood should also achieve atonement from his bull. <b>And</b> one should <b>not</b> say that <b>they achieve atonement through the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>as it is not</b> found <b>with regard to</b> Aaron’s <b>household</b> that <b>an exception was made to its rule</b> that it atones for the people, as his household does not achieve atonement from the scapegoat.
<b>And if it is your wish to say</b> that this reasoning can be refuted, one can cite another proof, as the verse <b>states:</b> “House of Israel, bless the Lord; <b>house of Aaron, bless the Lord; house of Levi, bless the Lord; those who fear the Lord, bless the Lord”</b> (Psalms 135:19–20). It is apparent from this verse that “house of Aaron” is referring to all priests and not just to Aaron’s immediate household, and so it is reasonable that Aaron’s bull should atone for them.
The Gemara repeats its question about this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this <i>baraita</i>? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says:</b> It <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as, if</b> one suggests that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> one can counter: <b>Doesn’t he say</b> that the <b>priests have</b> a means of <b>atonement through</b> the <b>scapegoat,</b> whereas the <i>baraita</i> indicates that they do not, as it states that if they do not achieve atonement through the bull of Aaron, then they do not have any means through which to achieve atonement? <b>But</b> then, <b>whose</b> opinion is expressed? <b>Rava says:</b> It <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that the <b>priests do not have</b> a means of achieving <b>atonement through</b> the <b>scapegoat.</b>
<b>Abaye said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and <b>this</b> is what it <b>is saying:</b> If <b>that is so,</b> that the priests do not achieve atonement through the bull of Aaron, then <b>they do not have</b> any means through which to achieve <b>atonement for</b> the <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods. <b>When</b> the verse <b>states: “And he shall effect atonement…upon the priests,” we have</b> clearly <b>found that they</b> do <b>have</b> a means of <b>atonement for other transgressions. And</b> it follows that <b>just as we have found that they have</b> a means of <b>atonement for other transgressions,</b> as Israelites do, <b>so</b> too, <b>they</b> must also <b>have</b> a means of <b>atonement</b>

Daf 14a

<b>for</b> their <b>defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods. <b>Through which</b> means, then, <b>do they achieve atonement</b> for this? Is it through the internal goat or the bull of Aaron? It is <b>better</b> to say <b>that they achieve atonement through the bull of Aaron, as</b> in any event <b>with regard to his household an exception was made to its rule</b> that it atones only for Aaron. <b>And</b> one should <b>not</b> say that <b>they achieve atonement through the goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>as it is not</b> found that with regard to Aaron’s household <b>an exception was made to its rule.</b>
<b>And if it is your wish to say</b> that this reasoning can be refuted, one can bring another proof, as <b>it states: “House of Aaron, bless the Lord,”</b> which is referring to all priests and not just to Aaron’s immediate household, and so it is reasonable that Aaron’s bull should atone for them.
The Gemara clarifies the last part of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And what</b> possible refutation is the <i>baraita</i> referring to when it says: <b>If it is your wish to say</b> that this reasoning can be refuted? The Gemara explains: <b>And if you would say</b> of the preceding proof that it is incorrect to suggest that all priests achieve atonement from the bull of Aaron, as with regard to it the term: <b>“His household”</b> (Leviticus 16:6), <b>is written,</b> which suggests that it atones only for his immediate family, then this can be refuted, as <b>all of</b> the priests <b>are</b> collectively <b>referred to as his household,</b> as is evident from <b>that</b> which <b>is stated: “House of Aaron, bless the Lord;</b> house of Levi, bless the Lord, <b>those who fear the Lord, bless the Lord.”</b>
The Gemara questions some of the expositions of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> phrase: “Goat <b>of the people”</b> (Leviticus 16:15), <b>does it come to</b> teach <b>that</b> which the <i>baraita</i> teaches, i.e., that the priests do not achieve atonement through it? But <b>that</b> phrase <b>is necessary</b> to teach <b>that the Merciful One states</b> that the goat <b>must be</b> purchased with funds collected <b>from</b> the <b>people.</b> The Gemara refutes this: <b>That</b> requirement <b>is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And from the assembly of the children of Israel</b> he shall take two goats” (Leviticus 16:5).
The Gemara asks further: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> phrase: <b>“His own</b> bull sin-offering” (Leviticus 16:6), <b>does it come to</b> teach <b>that</b> which the <i>baraita</i> teaches, i.e., that it atones only for Aaron’s transgressions, not for the transgressions of others? But <b>that</b> phrase <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The High Priest <b>brings,</b> i.e., purchases, the bull <b>from his own</b> funds, <b>but he does not bring it from</b> funds collected <b>from the public.</b>
One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he does not bring it from</b> funds collected <b>from the public because the public does not achieve atonement through it, but he may bring</b> it <b>from</b> funds belonging to <b>his brethren the priests because his brethren the priests achieve atonement through it.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “His own</b> bull sin-offering,” to indicate that he must purchase it using only his own funds. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should not bring</b> it from others’ funds, <b>but</b> nevertheless, <b>if he did</b> it would still be <b>valid.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse again states “his own.” The verse repeats</b> the phrase <b>to render</b> the requirement <b>essential.</b>
If both mentions of the phrase “his own” are necessary to teach about the ownership of the bull, how can the above <i>baraita</i> suggest that the phrase indicates that the bull atones only for the High Priest’s transgressions? The Gemara explains: <b>This is what</b> is <b>difficult for the <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is different about</b> the goat <b>of the people that</b> explains why <b>it does not atone</b> for the priests? The difference is <b>that</b> the priests <b>did not forfeit</b> any <b>money over</b> the purchase of <b>it.</b> Therefore, it does not atone for the priests, but only for the Israelites, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the internal goat: <b>“Of the people.” With regard to</b> the bull <b>of Aaron as well,</b> the priests <b>do not forfeit</b> any <b>money over</b> the purchase of <b>it,</b> so it follows that they should not achieve atonement through it. <b>And</b> therefore, to explain why they do achieve atonement, the <i>baraita</i> <b>states</b> that <b>all of</b> the priests <b>are</b> collectively <b>referred to as: His household.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that the priests do not achieve atonement through the scapegoat, <b>that is</b> why <b>it is written</b> in the Torah that <b>two confessions</b> are to be recited over the bull <b>and</b> that the <b>blood of the bull</b> is to be presented inside the Sanctuary: Of these three forms of atonement, <b>one corresponds to</b> the atonement provided by the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed inside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>one corresponds to</b> the atonement provided by the <b>goat whose</b> blood presentation is <b>performed outside</b> the Sanctuary, <b>and one corresponds to</b> the atonement provided by <b>the scapegoat.</b>
<b>But according to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that the priests do achieve atonement through the scapegoat, <b>why do I</b> need the <b>two confessions</b> recited over the bull <b>and</b> the <b>blood of the bull</b> to be presented inside the Sanctuary? <b>One confession</b> over the bull <b>and its blood</b> being presented inside the Sanctuary <b>would be sufficient.</b>
The Gemara answers: Two confessions are necessary, <b>one for</b> the High Priest <b>himself, and one for his household,</b> i.e., the priests, <b>as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The High Priest must first confess his own transgressions and only afterward those of the priests, because <b>that is</b> how <b>the attribute of justice functions:</b> It is <b>better that the innocent come and atone for the guilty, than</b> that <b>the guilty come and atone for the guilty.</b> When the High Priest confesses the transgressions of those in his house, it is better that he already be considered innocent, having confessed and been absolved of his own transgressions.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to cases of <b>awareness of the defiling</b> of the Temple by entering it while one is ritually impure, or defiling its sacrificial foods by partaking of them while one is ritually impure, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four.</b> How so? If <b>one became ritually impure and he was aware</b> that he was impure, <b>but</b> afterward his <b>impurity was hidden from him, though he remembered</b> that he was partaking of <b>sacrificial</b> food, which is forbidden to one who is in a state of ritual impurity; this is one of the four types of awareness of impurity.
If the fact that he was partaking of <b>sacrificial</b> food <b>was hidden from him, though he remembered the ritual impurity</b> that he had contracted; this is the second of the four types of awareness of impurity. And the same <i>halakha</i> applies if both <b>this and that were hidden from him,</b> both the fact that he was impure and the fact that he was partaking of sacrificial food. In all these cases, if <b>he partook of the sacrificial</b> food <b>and was unaware</b> either that he was impure, or that the food was sacrificial food, or both, <b>and after he partook of</b> it <b>he became aware</b> of that which he had forgotten, <b>he is</b> required to bring <b>a sliding-scale</b> offering. In this type of offering, the sinner sacrifices an animal, bird, or meal-offering, depending on his financial status.
And similarly with regard to entering the Temple: If <b>one became ritually impure and he was aware</b> that he was impure, <b>but</b> afterward his <b>impurity was hidden from him,</b> though <b>he remembered</b> that he was entering <b>the Temple,</b> which is prohibited for one who is in a state of ritual impurity; this is the third of the four types of awareness of impurity. If the fact that he was entering <b>the Temple was hidden from him,</b> though <b>he remembered the ritual impurity</b> that he had contracted; this is the fourth type of awareness of impurity. And the same <i>halakha</i> applies if both <b>this and that were hidden from him,</b> both the fact that he was impure and the fact that he was entering the Temple. In all these cases, if <b>he entered the Temple and was unaware</b> either that he was impure, or that he was entering the Temple, or both, <b>and after he left he became aware</b> of what was hidden from him, <b>he is</b> required to bring <b>a sliding-scale</b> offering.
As for the boundaries of the Temple with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity, <b>the same</b> <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>one who enters the</b> area that was part of the original Temple <b>courtyard and</b> to <b>one who enters the</b> later <b>addition to the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> because the additional section is sanctified with the full sanctity of the Temple courtyard. The mishna notes: <b>As, additions can be made to the city</b> of Jerusalem <b>or to the</b> Temple <b>courtyards only by</b> a special body comprising the <b>king, a prophet, the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, and the Sanhedrin of seventy-one</b> judges, <b>and with two thanks-offerings and with</b> a special <b>song.</b> Once the addition to the courtyard is made by this body and this process, it is given the full sanctity of the original courtyard area.
The mishna provides certain details of the consecration ceremony. <b>And the court</b> would <b>move</b> forward, <b>and two thanks-offerings</b> would be brought <b>after them, and all of the Jewish people</b> would follow <b>behind them.</b>

Daf 14b

When they would reach the end of the place that they desired to consecrate, <b>the inner</b> thanks-offering would <b>be eaten and the outer one</b> would <b>be burned.</b> The details of this ceremony will be described in the Gemara. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>any</b> addition to the Temple <b>that was not made with all these</b> ceremonial procedures, <b>one who enters there</b> while ritually impure <b>is not liable</b> to bring an offering if his entry was unwitting, nor to be punished with <i>karet</i>, excision from the World-to-Come, if his entry was intentional.
The first part of the mishna discussed one who became ritually impure before entering the Temple. The mishna proceeds to consider a case involving one who was ritually pure when he entered the Temple but <b>who became impure</b> while <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard, and</b> afterward, his <b>impurity was hidden from him</b> but <b>he remembered</b> that he was standing in <b>the Temple,</b> or the fact that he was standing in <b>the Temple was hidden from him</b> but <b>he remembered</b> his <b>impurity,</b> or both <b>this</b> fact <b>and that</b> fact <b>were hidden from him.</b> In all these cases, if <b>he bowed</b> down, <b>or he tarried</b> in the Temple courtyard <b>long enough to bow down</b> even though he did not actually bow, <b>or he went out</b> by way of <b>a longer</b> route when he could have taken a shorter route, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering. But if he left the Temple via <b>the shortest</b> way, he is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>This</b> mitzva that the ritually impure must be sent out of the Temple <b>is the positive mitzva concerning the Temple for which,</b> as is taught elsewhere in the Mishna (<i>Horayot</i> 8b), the Sanhedrin <b>is not liable</b> to bring an offering for an erroneous ruling. A communal bull sin-offering is brought because of the unwitting transgression of a prohibition involving an action by the Jewish people resulting from an erroneous halakhic decision handed down by the Sanhedrin. But if the Sanhedrin mistakenly ruled that one who became impure while in the Temple may leave by way of a longer route, they do not bring this offering, as it is brought only for an erroneous ruling on a matter that requires the bringing of a fixed sin-offering, and not a sliding-scale offering, for its unwitting violation.
<b>And which is the positive mitzva with regard to a menstruating woman for which,</b> as is taught in <i>Horayot</i> there, the Sanhedrin is <b>liable</b> to bring a bull offering for an erroneous ruling? If a man <b>was engaging in intercourse with a ritually pure woman, and</b> during the course of their act of intercourse <b>she</b> experienced menstrual bleeding and <b>said to him: I have become impure, and</b> unwittingly <b>he immediately withdrew</b> from her and did not wait until his penis became flaccid, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for engaging in intercourse with a menstruating woman, <b>because his withdrawal</b> from her <b>is as pleasant to him as his entry.</b> If the Sanhedrin mistakenly ruled that one may withdraw immediately, they bring a bull offering for their erroneous ruling.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to the sliding-scale offering the verse states: “Or if a person touches any impure thing, whether it is the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher <b>creeping animal, and it is hidden from him”</b> (Leviticus 5:2). A precise reading of this verse indicates that in a case where one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he had contracted ritual impurity by touching <b>a creeping animal,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering for having defiled the Temple or the sacrificial food, <b>but he is not liable</b> to bring such an offering in a case where he has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he is entering the <b>Temple</b> or partaking of sacrificial food.
Similarly, <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And it is hidden from him, so that he is impure”</b> (Leviticus 5:2), thereby teaching that in a case when one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he had contracted <b>ritual impurity,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering, <b>but</b> one <b>is not liable</b> to bring such an offering in a case when he has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he is entering the <b>Temple</b> or partaking of sacrificial food.
<b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> The verse states: <b>“And it is hidden</b> from him” (Leviticus 5:2), and it states: <b>“And it is hidden</b> from him” (Leviticus 5:3), <b>twice,</b> in order <b>to render one liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering both in a case where one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he had contracted <b>ritual impurity and</b> in a case where one has <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he is entering the <b>Temple.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the <i>halakhot</i> concerning awareness of ritual impurity are two that are further subdivided into four. <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> Are these actually <b>two</b> states of awareness <b>that are</b> subdivided into <b>four?</b> As the mishna lists them, they seem to <b>be two that are</b> subdivided into <b>six: Awareness of the impurity</b> at the <b>beginning and</b> at the <b>end, awareness of the sacrificial</b> food at the <b>beginning and</b> at the <b>end,</b> and <b>awareness of</b> the <b>Temple</b> at the <b>beginning and</b> at the <b>end.</b>
Abaye answered him: <b>According to your reasoning,</b> that you count all the various cases listed in the mishna, <b>there are eight</b> states of awareness, <b>as there is</b> also awareness of the <b>impurity</b> in connection <b>with</b> eating the <b>sacrificial</b> food, at the beginning and at the end, <b>and</b> awareness of the <b>impurity</b> in connection <b>with</b> entering the <b>Temple,</b> at the <b>beginning and</b> at the <b>end.</b> The mishna mentions awareness of the impurity both in the first clause, which discusses partaking of sacrificial food, and in the second clause, which discusses entering the Temple.
Rav Pappa refutes this: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as the status of <b>ritual impurity</b> carries <b>one name</b> in both cases: The person was aware that he had contracted ritual impurity and then it became hidden from him, and there is no reason to distinguish between impurity in connection with partaking of sacrificial food and impurity in connection with entering the Temple. Accordingly, Rav Pappa’s first question remains: <b>In any case there are six</b> states of awareness.
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> in answer to his own question: <b>Actually, there are eight</b> states of awareness, two of the impurity in connection with partaking of sacrificial food, two of the impurity in connection with entering the Temple, two of awareness of the sacrificial food, and two of awareness of the Temple, each pair having one awareness at the beginning and one at the end. But <b>the first four</b> states of awareness at the beginning <b>do not</b> in themselves <b>bring</b> the unwitting transgressor <b>to</b> liability to bring <b>an offering,</b> as if he does not reach awareness at the end, he will not have known that he transgressed. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not count</b> them. But the <i>tanna</i> <b>does count the last four</b> states of awareness, <b>which bring</b> the unwitting transgressor <b>to</b> the liability to bring <b>an offering.</b>
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Pappa</b> said as follows: <b>Actually, there are eight</b> states of awareness, <b>and</b> it is <b>the first four</b> states of awareness at the beginning, <b>which are not</b> found <b>in the entire Torah,</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>counts.</b> In all the other instances where one is liable to bring an offering for an unwitting transgression, it is not necessary that there be any awareness at the beginning. Since this is a novel requirement, the <i>tanna</i> counts these states of awareness. But the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not count the last four</b> states of awareness at the end, <b>which are</b> found also <b>in the entire Torah,</b> as a standard sin-offering is brought when one is made aware after the fact that he had transgressed.
The <i>amora’im</i> try to define the awareness of the impurity mentioned in the mishna. <b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity became hidden from him, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he liable to bring a sliding-scale offering in such a situation? The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case under discussion? <b>If we say that he did not know whether a creeping animal is impure</b> or pure <b>or whether a frog is impure</b> or pure, this <b>is</b> a topic that you could <b>go learn in a children’s school.</b> As these matters are explicitly recorded in the Torah, they can never be considered hidden.
<b>Actually,</b> Rav Pappa must have been asking about a case <b>where he knew</b> the essential <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the ritual impurity of a creeping animal, and</b> it is a case <b>where he touched</b> a portion of the animal that was <b>of a lentil-bulk and he did not know</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>whether</b> a portion that was <b>of a lentil-bulk renders</b> a person <b>impure or does not render</b> him <b>impure. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in such a case? The Gemara explains the two possibilities: Does one say that <b>since he knows generally that a creeping animal renders</b> a person <b>impure, it is awareness? Or perhaps</b> one says that <b>since he does not know whether</b> a portion that was <b>of a lentil-bulk renders</b> a person <b>impure or does not render</b> a person <b>impure, it is</b> considered <b>hidden</b> from him. The Gemara comments: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma</b> concerning the awareness of the Temple: If <b>a Babylonian</b> or a resident of another country <b>ascended to Eretz Yisrael, and the site of the Temple was hidden from him,</b> so that he unwittingly entered into the Temple in a state of ritual impurity, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he liable to bring a sliding-scale offering to atone for his offense, or not?
The Gemara clarifies: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion was this dilemma raised? <b>If</b> it was raised <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, who requires</b> that there be <b>awareness at the beginning</b> in order for one to become liable to bring an offering, that is difficult, as Rabbi Akiva <b>does not deem</b> one <b>liable</b> when he had <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he was entering <b>the Temple.</b> And <b>if</b> the dilemma was raised <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael, who deems</b> one <b>liable</b> when he had <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he was entering the <b>Temple,</b> that is difficult, as Rabbi Yishmael <b>does not require</b> that there be <b>awareness at the beginning.</b> According to both <i>tanna’im</i>, the dilemma is not relevant.
The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to raise the dilemma <b>only in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who requires awareness at the beginning and</b> also <b>deems</b> one <b>liable</b> when he had <b>a lapse of awareness</b> that he was entering the <b>Temple, and he</b> also <b>says</b> that <b>awareness</b> that one gains in <b>the house of his teacher is called awareness</b> (see 5a). <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in such a case? The Gemara explains the two possibilities: Does one say that <b>since he knows that there is a Temple</b> someplace <b>in the world, it is awareness? Or perhaps</b> one says that <b>since he does not know the</b> precise <b>location of</b> the Temple, <b>it is</b> considered <b>hidden</b> from him. The Gemara comments: This dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>The same</b> <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>one who enters the</b> area that was part of the original Temple <b>courtyard</b> and to one who enters the later addition to the Temple courtyard, as additions can be made to the city of Jerusalem or to the Temple courtyards only by a special body comprising the king, a prophet, the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, and the Sanhedrin of seventy-one judges, and with two thanks-offerings and with a special song. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rav Shimi bar Ḥiyya said: As the verse states: “According to all that I show you, the form of the Tabernacle, and the form of all its vessels,</b>

Daf 15a

<b>and so shall you do”</b> (Exodus 25:9). The final words: “And so shall you do,” are superfluous and serve to teach: As was done in the Tabernacle, so shall you do <b>in</b> future <b>generations.</b>
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all the</b> sacred <b>vessels that Moses fashioned, their anointment</b> with oil <b>consecrates them. From that</b> point <b>forward,</b> in the generations after Moses, new vessels do not require anointment to be consecrated; rather, <b>their</b> use in the Temple <b>service initiates them</b> and renders them fit for use. Rava clarifies the objection: <b>But why</b> is this so? <b>Let us say</b> here as well that the phrase <b>“and so shall you do”</b> teaches that the same must be done <b>in</b> future <b>generations.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there,</b> as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the Tabernacle and its vessels: <b>“And he anointed them and consecrated them”</b> (Numbers 7:1). This teaches that it is only <b>“them,”</b> the vessels fashioned by Moses, that are consecrated <b>through anointment, but</b> vessels fashioned <b>in</b> later <b>generations are not</b> consecrated <b>through anointment.</b>
The Gemara asks: Why not <b>say: “Them,”</b> the vessels made by Moses, he consecrated specifically <b>through anointment,</b> but vessels made <b>in future generations</b> are consecrated <b>either through anointment or through</b> their initial <b>service? Rav Pappa said: The verse states:</b> “And they shall take all the service vessels, <b>with which they will serve in the Sanctuary”</b> (Numbers 4:12). The future tense “they will serve,” indicates that the verse is referring to future vessels, and <b>the verse makes them dependent upon service,</b> teaching that in future generations vessels will be consecrated through their initial service.
The Gemara asks: <b>Now that the Merciful One has written “with which they will serve,” why do I</b> need the restrictive term <b>“them”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Had the Merciful One not written “them,” I would say that they,</b> the vessels made by Moses, were consecrated <b>through anointment</b> alone, but vessels made <b>in</b> later <b>generations</b> must be consecrated both <b>through anointment and through service, as</b> the Torah <b>wrote: “And so shall you do,”</b> referring to future generations. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One excluded</b> future vessels from anointment by stating <b>“them,”</b> teaching that it is only <b>them</b> that were consecrated <b>through anointment, but in</b> later <b>generations</b> they are <b>not</b> consecrated <b>through anointment.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And with two thanks-offerings.</b> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>two thanks-offerings that are mentioned</b> here, the reference is <b>to their loaves, but not to their flesh.</b> An animal thanks-offering is accompanied by forty loaves of bread that are brought as a meal-offering. Ten loaves are leavened, and the remainder is comprised of ten each of three types of unleavened bread. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: As the verse states</b> with regard to the consecration of the wall of Jerusalem in the days of Ezra: <b>“And I placed two large thanks-offerings, and we went in procession to the right upon the wall”</b> (Nehemiah 12:31).
The Gemara clarifies the meaning of this verse: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>“large”? If we say</b> that the animals of the thanks-offering were <b>literally from a large species,</b> i.e., oxen, rather than from a small species, i.e., sheep, <b>let</b> the verse <b>state</b> that they were <b>oxen. Rather,</b> let us say that he took animals from among <b>the largest</b> and the finest quality <b>of their species.</b>
The Gemara challenges this: <b>Is</b> the size of the offering <b>of</b> any <b>importance before Heaven? But isn’t it taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 110a): <b>It is stated with regard to an animal burnt-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma”</b> (Leviticus 1:9), and it is also stated <b>with regard to a bird burnt-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma”</b> (Leviticus 1:17), and it is also stated <b>with regard to a meal-offering: “A fire offering, a pleasing aroma”</b> (Leviticus 2:2). The same term is used in all three cases even though the three offerings are of different value. This <b>teaches that one who brings a substantial</b> sacrifice <b>and one who brings a modest</b> sacrifice have equal merit, and both offerings are accepted as having a pleasing aroma, <b>provided that one directs his heart to his Father in Heaven.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> let us say that “large thanks-offerings” means <b>the larger</b> element <b>in the thanks-offering</b> loaves. <b>And what is that?</b> The <b>leavened</b> loaves, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 76b): The meal part of <b>the thanks-offering came from five Jerusalem <i>se’a</i></b> of flour, <b>which are</b> equivalent to <b>six wilderness</b> <i>se’a</i>. The <i>se’a</i> referred to in the Bible when the Jewish people were in the wilderness is smaller than the <i>se’a</i> used later in Jerusalem. <b>This is</b> equivalent to <b>two ephahs,</b> each <b>ephah</b> being <b>three</b> wilderness <b><i>se’a</i>.</b> These two ephahs are <b>twenty</b> measures of <b>a tenth</b> of an ephah. <b>Ten</b> of these tenths were used <b>to</b> make <b>leavened</b> loaves <b>and ten</b> of these tenths were used <b>to</b> make <b>unleavened</b> loaves. <b>And the unleavened</b> loaves were <b>of three types: Loaves</b> of matza, <b>wafers,</b> and <b>measures of flour mixed</b> with water and oil. Accordingly, the leavened loaves were three times the size of the unleavened ones, and it was the leavened loaves that were used to consecrate additions to the city.
<b>Rami bar Ḥama says:</b> One can infer from this <i>baraita</i> that <b>the</b> Temple <b>courtyard is consecrated only with the remainder of the meal-offering,</b> and not by the loaves of a thanks-offering. The remainder of the meal-offering is the part left over after a handful of it and its frankincense have been sacrificed on the altar; this remainder is eaten by a priest. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The consecration of the Temple courtyard is <b>like</b> the consecration of <b>Jerusalem. Just as</b> with regard to <b>Jerusalem, an item that is eaten</b> specifically <b>in it,</b> i.e., the loaves of a thanks-offering, which are eaten anywhere in the city, <b>consecrates</b> the city, <b>so too,</b> with regard to the Temple <b>courtyard, an item that is eaten</b> specifically <b>in it,</b> i.e., the remainder of the meal-offering, <b>consecrates</b> the courtyard.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say that the loaves of a thanks-offering are not eaten in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard? Rather,</b> the comparison should be drawn as follows: The consecration of the Temple courtyard is <b>like</b> the consecration of <b>Jerusalem. Just as Jerusalem</b> is consecrated with the loaves of a thanks-offering, which is <b>an item that is eaten inside</b> the city, <b>and</b> which, if <b>it emerges from</b> there, <b>is disqualified, so too,</b> the Temple <b>courtyard</b> is consecrated with <b>an item that is eaten inside</b> the courtyard, <b>and</b> which, if <b>it emerges from</b> there, <b>is disqualified.</b> This item is the remainder of a meal-offering, which can be eaten only by a priest and only in the Temple courtyard.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the consecration of the Temple courtyard is derived from the consecration of Jerusalem, let us say as follows: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to the consecration of an addition made to Jerusalem, the loaves used in the ceremony are <b>leavened, so too here,</b> with regard to the consecration of an addition made to the Temple courtyard, the remainder of the meal-offering should be <b>leavened.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this suggestion: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> this? <b>Is there a leavened meal-offering?</b> A meal-offering is always unleavened.

Daf 15b

<b>And if you would say that one leavens the remainder</b> of the meal-offering, which the priests partake of, <b>and he consecrates</b> the Temple courtyard <b>with it,</b> that too is difficult, as <b>isn’t it written: “It shall not be baked leavened, for their portion</b> I have given it to them” (Leviticus 6:10)? <b>And Reish Lakish says</b> in explanation of this verse: <b>Even</b> the priests’ <b>portion shall not be baked leavened,</b> as it is prohibited to bake even a portion of the meal-offering leavened.
The Gemara asks: Still, <b>why not</b> consecrate the Temple courtyard with a leavened meal-offering? <b>It is possible to consecrate</b> it <b>with the two loaves</b> of bread that are brought as a communal offering <b>on the</b> festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i>,</b> which is a meal-offering that is leavened. The Gemara answers: <b>Because</b> actually <b>it is not possible</b> to do so.
The Gemara explains why not. <b>How could we do</b> it? If <b>we build</b> the addition to the Temple courtyard <b>on the eve</b> of <i>Shavuot</i> <b>and</b> also <b>consecrate it on the eve</b> of the Festival, there is a difficulty, as <b>the two loaves become consecrated</b> as a meal-offering <b>with the slaughter of the</b> two <b>lambs</b> that are sacrificed together with them as peace-offerings, and this occurs on the Festival itself, not on the eve of the Festival.
If <b>we build</b> the addition to the Temple courtyard <b>on the eve</b> of the <i>Shavuot</i> festival, <b>but consecrate it</b> only <b>now,</b> on the Festival, this too is difficult, as <b>we require consecration at the time of</b> the completion of <b>the building.</b>
If <b>we build it on the Festival and consecrate it on the Festival,</b> this also cannot be, as <b>the building of the Temple does not override the Festival.</b>
If <b>we leave</b> the two loaves <b>until after</b> the Festival <b>and build</b> the addition to the Temple courtyard on the day after the Festival, <b>and consecrate it</b> by eating the two loaves on that day, this is difficult as well, as the two loaves <b>were already disqualified by</b> virtue of being <b>left overnight</b> after the Festival.
If <b>we build</b> the addition to the Temple courtyard <b>on the eve of the Festival and leave a little</b> unbuilt until after the Festival, and <b>as soon as the day is over</b> and the Festival is finished, <b>we immediately finish</b> building the addition <b>and consecrate it</b> with the two loaves before they become disqualified, this too is impossible, as <b>the building of the Temple cannot</b> take place <b>at night.</b> This is <b>as Abaye says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the building of the Temple cannot</b> take place <b>at night? As it is stated: “And on the day that the Tabernacle was erected”</b> (Numbers 9:15), from which it can be derived: One <b>may erect it during the day,</b> but one <b>may not erect it at night. Therefore, it is impossible</b> to consecrate the Temple courtyard with the two loaves; it must be done with the remainder of an unleavened meal-offering.
§ The mishna teaches concerning the consecration of an addition to the city of Jerusalem or the Temple courtyard: <b>And with a song. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: They sang <b>the song of thanksgiving,</b> i.e., Psalms, chapter 100, which begins: “A psalm of thanksgiving,” accompanied <b>by harps, lyres, and cymbals, at every corner and upon every large stone in Jerusalem. And</b> they also <b>recited</b> Psalms, chapter 30, which begins: <b>“I will extol You, O Lord, for You have lifted me up,” and the song of evil spirits,</b> i.e., Psalms, chapter 91, which begins: “He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High.” <b>And some say</b> that this psalm is called <b>the song of plagues.</b>
The reason of <b>the one who says</b> that it is called the song <b>of plagues</b> is <b>that it is written: “Nor shall any plague come near your dwelling”</b> (Psalms 91:10). <b>And</b> the reason of <b>the one who says</b> that it is called the song of <b>evil spirits</b> is <b>that it is written: “A thousand shall fall at your side</b> and ten thousand at your right hand; but it shall not come near you” (Psalms 91:7).
<b>And they recited</b> the psalm from the verse: <b>“He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide in the shadow of the Almighty”</b> (Psalms 91:1), <b>until</b> they completed the verse: <b>“Because You, O Lord, are my refuge; You have made the most High Your habitation”</b> (Psalms 91:9). <b>And they would then recite</b> Psalms, chapter 3, which begins: <b>“A psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Lord, how many are my enemies become,” until</b> they reached the verse: <b>“Salvation belongs to the Lord; Your blessing be upon Your people. Sela”</b> (Psalms 3:9), which is the end of that psalm.
It is related that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi would recite these verses</b> to protect him from evil spirits during the night <b>and fall asleep</b> while saying them. The Gemara asks: <b>How could he do that? But doesn’t Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> himself <b>say: One is prohibited from healing himself with words of Torah?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>To protect</b> oneself <b>is different,</b> as he recited these verses only to protect himself from evil spirits, and not to heal himself.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But rather, when</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>said</b> that this <b>is prohibited,</b> he was referring to a situation <b>where there is</b> already <b>a wound</b> and one recites these verses in order to heal himself. But <b>if there is</b> already <b>a wound</b> and he recites these verses over it, is only this <b>prohibited, and nothing more? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 90a), that <b>one who whispers</b> an incantation <b>over a wound has no share in the World-to-Come?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The mishna was <b>taught with regard to one who spits</b> into the wound and then whispers these verses. And the reason for the severity of this action is <b>that the name of Heaven must not be mentioned in connection with spitting,</b> as doing so is a show of contempt for God.
§ The mishna teaches that as part of the consecration ceremony, <b>the court</b> would <b>move</b> forward, <b>and two thanks-offerings</b> would be brought <b>after them,</b> and all of the Jewish people would follow behind them. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that the</b> members of the <b>court walk in front of the thanks-offering? But isn’t it written</b> in the verse from which this ceremony is derived: “And I placed two large thanks-offerings, and we went in procession to the right upon the wall, toward the dung gate; <b>and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah”</b> (Nehemiah 12:31–32)? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: The court moves</b> forward. <b>And</b> how is this done? <b>The two thanks-offerings move</b> forward, <b>and the court</b> follows <b>after them.</b>
The Gemara clarifies this point: <b>How</b> exactly did the two thanks-offerings <b>move</b> forward? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, disagree about this. <b>One</b> Sage <b>says: One</b> thanks-offering <b>alongside the other. And one</b> Sage <b>says: One behind the other.</b> According to <b>the one who says</b> that the two offerings moved <b>one alongside the other,</b> the thanks-offering that the mishna refers to as <b>the inner one</b> is <b>that which is closest to the wall.</b> According to <b>the one who says</b> that the two offerings moved <b>one behind the other,</b> the thanks-offering that is called <b>the inner one</b> is <b>that which is closest to</b> the members of <b>the court</b> advancing behind the thanks-offerings.
The Gemara analyzes these two opinions: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: When they would reach the end of the place that they desired to consecrate, <b>the inner</b> thanks-offering would <b>be eaten and the outer one</b> would <b>be burned. Granted, according to the one who says</b> that the two thanks-offerings moved forward <b>one behind the other,</b> and that the inner one is the one that was in the rear, it is <b>due to this</b> that <b>the inner one is eaten, because the outer one came before it and consecrated</b> the additional area, so that it is now a sanctified place fit for the eating of the thanks-offering loaves. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the two thanks-offerings moved forward <b>one alongside the other, the two of them together consecrated</b> the additional area. Why, then, is the inner one eaten and the outer one burned?
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to your reasoning, according to the one who says</b> that the two offerings moved forward <b>one behind the other, does one</b> offering by itself <b>consecrate</b> the area? <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that with regard to <b>any</b> addition <b>that was not made with all these</b> ceremonial procedures, the addition is not consecrated? <b>And even according to the one who says</b> (see 16a) that the correct reading of the mishna is: With regard to any addition that was not made <b>with</b> any <b>one of all these</b> ceremonial procedures, the addition is not consecrated, nevertheless, <b>these two</b> thanks-offerings <b>are one mitzva,</b> and one without the other would not consecrate the area.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b>

Daf 16a

<b>Based on a ruling of a prophet</b> the loaves of one thanks-offering <b>were eaten, and based on a ruling of a prophet</b> the loaves of the other thanks-offering <b>were burned.</b> The prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, who lived at the time of Ezra and Nehemiah’s reconsecration of Jerusalem, instructed the people concerning how the ceremony should be conducted, without providing reasons for the procedures.
§ The mishna teaches: And with regard to <b>any</b> addition to the Temple <b>that was not made with all these</b> ceremonial procedures, one who enters there while ritually impure is not liable. <b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about the text of the mishna. <b>Rav Huna says: We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>With all these,</b> which means that all of these procedures are indispensable, and if even one is missing, the consecration does not take effect. <b>Rav Naḥman says: We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>With one of all these;</b> i.e., any one of these procedures suffices for the consecration to take effect.
The Gemara further clarifies this disagreement. <b>Rav Huna says: We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>With all these.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>He maintains</b> that <b>the initial consecration</b> of the Temple in the days of David and Solomon <b>sanctified</b> it <b>for its time and sanctified</b> it <b>forever.</b> Therefore, the site of the Temple retained its original sanctity even during the days of the Second Temple. <b>And Ezra,</b> who reconsecrated the area, <b>did</b> so <b>merely as a commemoration</b> of the initial consecration. Accordingly, even though there was no king or <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, the entire area was fully consecrated. By contrast, in order to consecrate an area that had not been part of the initial consecration, all of these procedures are necessary and none can be omitted.
<b>Rav Naḥman says: We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>With one of all these.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>He maintains</b> that <b>the initial consecration</b> of the Temple <b>sanctified</b> it <b>for its time</b> only, <b>and did not sanctify</b> it <b>forever. And Ezra consecrated</b> the Temple and its courtyards, <b>even though there was no</b> king or <b><i>Urim VeTummim</i>.</b> Consequently, it follows that there is no need for all of these procedures in order for the consecration to take effect.
<b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman:</b> The mishna explicitly states: <b>Any</b> addition <b>that was not made with all these</b> procedures. Rav Naḥman said to him: Emend the mishna and <b>teach</b> it as stating: <b>With one of all these</b> procedures.
The Gemara cites a proof against the opinion of Rav Naḥman: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Shaul says: There were two ponds [<i>bitzin</i>] on the Mount of Olives [<i>Har HaMishḥa</i>], a lower</b> pond <b>and an upper</b> pond. <b>The lower</b> pond <b>was consecrated</b> during the time of the First Temple <b>with all</b> the procedures mentioned in the mishna, and it has the sanctity of Jerusalem for all purposes. By contrast, <b>the upper</b> pond <b>was not consecrated with all these</b> procedures, <b>but</b> rather it was consecrated <b>by those who returned from the exile</b> in Babylonia, <b>without a king and without</b> the <b><i>Urim VeTummim</i>.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>the lower</b> pond, <b>whose consecration was complete, <i>amei ha’aretz</i>,</b> uneducated people who were not scrupulous in their observance of the mitzvot relating to tithes and to ritual purity, <b>would enter into there and</b> would <b>partake of offerings of lesser sanctity</b> that may be eaten in all of Jerusalem <b>there, but</b> they would <b>not</b> partake of <b>second tithe</b> there because they conducted themselves stringently concerning this matter. <b>And <i>ḥaverim</i>,</b> who were meticulous in their observance of those mitzvot, <b>would partake of</b> both <b>offerings of lesser sanctity and second tithe there.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: As for <b>the upper</b> pond, <b>whose consecration was incomplete, <i>amei ha’aretz</i> would enter into there and partake of offerings of lesser sanctity there, but</b> they would <b>not</b> partake of <b>second tithe</b> there. <b>And <i>ḥaverim</i> would partake of neither offerings of lesser sanctity nor second tithe there. And for what</b> reason <b>did they not consecrate</b> the upper pond? It was <b>because additions can be made to the city</b> of Jerusalem <b>or to the</b> Temple <b>courtyards only by</b> a special body comprising the <b>king, a prophet, the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, and the Sanhedrin of seventy-one, and with two thanks-offerings and with</b> a special <b>song.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But why did they consecrate</b> the upper pond if they could not do so properly? This Gemara responds: <b>Why did they consecrate it? Didn’t you say</b> that <b>they did not consecrate it? Rather,</b> the question should be asked as follows: Given that they could not consecrate the upper pond, <b>why did they bring it within</b> the walls of the city? The Gemara answers: <b>Because it was a weak point [<i>turpa</i>] of Jerusalem and it would have been easy to conquer</b> the city <b>from there,</b> it became necessary to include it within the wall. This <i>baraita</i> seems to present explicit proof against the opinion of Rav Naḥman, who holds that there is no need for all of the procedures listed in the mishna in order for the consecration to be complete.
The Gemara rejects this proof: This <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> as to whether the initial consecration of Jerusalem and the Temple sanctified them only for their time or forever. Abba Shaul maintains that the initial consecration lapsed, and therefore the reconsecration required all of the procedures mentioned in the mishna. Where is this dispute taught? <b>As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 8:6): <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: I heard</b> that <b>when they were building the Sanctuary</b> in the Second Temple, <b>they fashioned</b> temporary <b>curtains for the Sanctuary and</b> temporary <b>curtains for the courtyards</b> to serve as partitions until the construction of the stone walls was completed. The difference was <b>only that in the Sanctuary,</b> the workers <b>built</b> the walls <b>outside</b> the curtains, without entering, <b>and in the courtyards,</b> the workers <b>built</b> the walls <b>within</b> the curtains.
The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says: I heard that one sacrifices offerings</b> on the altar <b>even if there is no Temple,</b> and <b>one partakes of offerings of the most sacred order</b> in the Temple courtyard <b>even if there are no curtains, and</b> one partakes of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity and second-tithe</b> produce in Jerusalem <b>even if there is no wall</b> surrounding the city. This is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the initial consecration sanctified</b> the Temple and Jerusalem <b>for their time and</b> also <b>sanctified</b> them <b>forever.</b> The Gemara concludes: From the fact that Rabbi Yehoshua based his opinion on the principle that the initial consecration sanctified the Temple and Jerusalem forever, can one <b>not</b> learn <b>by inference</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer maintains</b> that <b>it did not sanctify</b> them <b>forever?</b> Apparently, this issue is the subject of a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i>.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: From where</b> do you draw this inference? <b>Perhaps everyone</b> maintains that <b>the initial consecration sanctified</b> the Temple and Jerusalem <b>for their time and</b> also <b>sanctified</b> them <b>forever. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>stated that</b> tradition, <b>which he heard</b> from his teachers, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehoshua, <b>stated that</b> tradition, <b>which he heard</b> from his teachers, and there is no dispute between them. <b>And if you would say: Why do I</b> need <b>curtains</b> at all <b>according to Rabbi Eliezer?</b> The original sanctity remained when Jerusalem was not surrounded by walls, and similarly, the presence or absence of curtains is irrelevant to the sanctity of the Temple area. The Gemara answers: The curtains were established <b>merely for seclusion,</b> as it would have been unbecoming for the activity in this most sacred venue to be visible to all.
<b>Rather,</b> this matter is subject to a dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the walled cities listed in the mishna in tractate <i>Arakhin</i> (32a): <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: Why did the Sages enumerate</b> specifically <b>these</b> nine cities as cities that were walled since the days of Joshua, son of Nun? In fact, there were many more. The reason is <b>that when the exiles ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael from Babylonia in the time of Ezra, <b>they found these</b> cities <b>and consecrated them</b> as walled cities; <b>but the</b> sanctity of the <b>first</b> walled cities, enumerated in the book of Joshua, <b>was nullified when</b> settlement in <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>was negated</b> and the Jewish people were exiled. The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, <b>maintains: The initial consecration sanctified</b> the Temple and Jerusalem <b>for their time</b> only <b>and did not sanctify</b> them <b>forever.</b>
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, says: Were these</b> cities that are enumerated in tractate <i>Arakhin</i> <b>the only</b> walled cities? <b>But isn’t it already stated: “Sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og, king of Bashan, all these were cities fortified with high walls,</b> gates and bars” (Deuteronomy 3:4–5), indicating that there were many walled cities in the time of Joshua? <b>Rather, why</b> then <b>did the Sages enumerate</b> specifically <b>these</b> cities? It is due to the fact <b>that when the exiles ascended</b> from Babylonia <b>they found these and consecrated them</b> as walled cities.
The Gemara asks: <b>They consecrated them?</b> If their sanctity remained, it should not have been necessary to consecrate them. <b>Now, don’t we say later</b> in the same <i>baraita</i> <b>that it is not necessary to consecrate</b> them? The Gemara clarifies: <b>Rather,</b> this is what the <i>baraita</i> means to say: When the exiles ascended from Babylonia <b>they found these and enumerated them.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And not only these, but</b> in <b>any</b> city with regard to <b>which you receive a tradition from your ancestors that it was surrounded by a wall from the days of Joshua, son of Nun, all these mitzvot</b> with regard to walled cities <b>are observed in it, due to</b> the fact <b>that the initial consecration sanctified</b> the Temple and Jerusalem <b>for their time and sanctified</b> them <b>forever.</b> The Gemara comments: This is <b>difficult,</b> as there is a contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yishmael bar Yosei and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yishmael bar Yosei.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that there are <b>two <i>tanna’im</i></b> who disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael bar Yosei.</b> Each transmitted Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion in a different manner. And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead that one of the traditions is mistaken, as <b>one of the</b> <i>baraitot</i> <b>was stated by Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei,</b> and not his brother, Rabbi Yishmael. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei says</b> that the verse with regard to walled cities states: <b>“Which has [<i>lo</i>] a wall”</b> (Leviticus 25:30). The word <i>lo</i> is written with an <i>alef</i>, meaning no, and accordingly the verse would be stating to the contrary, that the city does not have a wall, but its vocalization is in the sense of its homonym, <i>lo</i> with a <i>vav</i>, meaning that it has a wall. This indicates that <b>even if it does not presently have</b> a wall <b>but it had</b> a wall <b>previously,</b> it retains its status as a walled city. It is Rabbi Elazar bar Yosei who maintains that the first consecration sanctified the Temple and Jerusalem forever.

Daf 16b

§ The mishna teaches about one who was ritually pure when he entered the Temple but <b>who became impure</b> while <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard, and</b> afterward his <b>impurity was hidden from him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one is liable even if he contracted <b>impurity in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard</b> and failed to leave immediately by way of the shortest route, and not only if he entered the Temple courtyard when he was already impure? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: One verse states: “He has defiled the Tabernacle of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 19:13), <b>and one verse states: “For he has defiled the Temple of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 19:20). <b>If</b> this second verse <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of</b> one who contracted <b>impurity outside</b> before he entered the Temple courtyard, as this situation is already referred to in the previous verse, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of</b> one who contracted <b>impurity inside</b> the Temple courtyard.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is it really <b>superfluous</b> to have both of these <b>verses,</b> one having been sufficient? <b>Aren’t they</b> each <b>necessary</b> to teach a novel ruling? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar says: If it is stated: “Tabernacle,” why does it state: “Temple”? And if it is stated: “Temple,” why does it state: “Tabernacle”?</b> He explains: <b>Had</b> the verse <b>stated</b> only: <b>“Tabernacle,” and not stated: “Temple,” I would have said</b> that one is <b>liable for</b> entering <b>the Tabernacle</b> in a state of impurity, <b>since it was anointed with the anointing oil,</b> and therefore it carries greater sanctity, <b>but he is not liable for</b> entering <b>the Temple,</b> which was not anointed with the anointing oil. <b>And had</b> the verse <b>stated</b> only: <b>“Temple,” and not stated: “Tabernacle,” I would have said</b> that one is <b>liable for</b> entering <b>the Temple</b> in a state of impurity, <b>since its sanctity is an eternal sanctity, but he is not liable for</b> entering <b>the Tabernacle,</b> whose sanctity was only for its time. <b>For this reason, it is stated: “Tabernacle,” and for this reason, it is stated: “Temple.”</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> did not base his derivation on a superfluous verse, but on the change in wording between the two verses. <b>This is what is difficult for him: Since the Tabernacle is</b> also <b>called Temple and the Temple is</b> also <b>called Tabernacle, then let</b> the verse <b>write either</b> in <b>both</b> verses: <b>Temple, or</b> in <b>both</b> verses: <b>Tabernacle; why do I</b> need both <b>“Tabernacle” and “Temple”? Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it,</b> i.e., that one is liable even for impurity contracted inside the grounds, and that the <i>halakha</i> applies both in the Tabernacle and in the Temple.
The Gemara questions its previous assumption: <b>Granted, the Temple is</b> also <b>called Tabernacle, as it is written: “And I will set My Tabernacle among you”</b> (Leviticus 26:11), where the reference is to the Temple, as the verse is referring to that which will transpire after the Jewish people have settled in their land. <b>But from where do we</b> derive <b>that the Tabernacle is</b> also <b>called Temple? If we say</b> that it is derived <b>from that which is written: “And the Kehatites, the bearers of the Temple, set forward”</b> (Numbers 10:21), <b>that</b> instance of the term Temple <b>is</b> not written with regard to the Tabernacle; rather, it is <b>written with regard to the Ark</b> and the other sacred vessels. <b>Rather,</b> it is derived <b>from here: “And let them make Me a Temple, that I may dwell among them”</b> (Exodus 25:8), where the reference is to the Tabernacle, as immediately afterward <b>it is written: “According to all that I show you, the pattern of the Tabernacle”</b> (Exodus 25:9).
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>he bowed down, or he tarried</b> in the Temple courtyard <b>long enough to bow down,</b> or he went out by way of a longer route when he could have taken a shorter route, he is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering. <b>Rava says: They taught</b> this <b>only when he bowed down</b> in the Temple courtyard <b>facing inward,</b> toward the Holy of Holies, as that alone is proper bowing. <b>But</b> if <b>he bowed down facing outward,</b> that is not considered bowing. When he bows facing outward, if <b>he tarried</b> in the Temple courtyard long enough to bow down, <b>yes,</b> he is liable, but if <b>he did not tarry</b> long enough to bow down, he is <b>not</b> liable.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who teach</b> the statement of Rava <b>with regard to the latter clause: Or</b> if <b>he tarried</b> in the Temple courtyard <b>long enough to bow down,</b> he is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering. It may be said <b>by inference that bowing down itself entails tarrying,</b> and the mere act of bowing does not render one liable. With regard to this <b>Rava says: They taught</b> this <b>only when he bowed down facing outward.</b> In such a case, he is liable only if he tarried long enough to bow down. <b>But</b> if he bowed down <b>facing inward</b> toward the Holy of Holies, he is liable <b>even if he did not tarry</b> for that length of time. <b>And this is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> If <b>he bowed down facing inward, or</b> if he <b>tarried long enough to bow down while</b> he was <b>bowing down facing outward,</b> he is <b>liable.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances of bowing in which there is tarrying, and what are the circumstances of bowing in which there is no tarrying?</b> The Gemara answers: With regard to bowing <b>in which there is no tarrying, that is merely kneeling.</b> As for bowing <b>in which there is tarrying,</b> that is prostrating oneself while <b>spreading</b> one’s <b>arms and legs</b> in total submission.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the measure of</b> that <b>tarrying? Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani and one</b> other Sage <b>who was with him disagree about this. And who is</b> that other scholar? <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi. And some say</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Pazi and one</b> other Sage <b>who was with him. And who is</b> that other scholar? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Naḥmani. And some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Shimon bar Naḥmani. One</b> Sage <b>says:</b> It is as long <b>as</b> the time it takes <b>to recite this</b> following <b>verse</b> in its entirety, <b>and one</b> Sage <b>says:</b> It is as long <b>as</b> the time it takes to recite <b>from</b> the term <b>“and they bowed”</b> in the middle of that verse <b>until the end.</b> What is the verse? <b>“And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the Lord upon the House, and they bowed with their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and prostrated themselves, and praised the Lord, saying: For He is good, for His steadfast love endures forever”</b> (II Chronicles 7:3).
The Gemara discusses the different forms of bowing in greater detail. <b>The Sages taught:</b> The term <b><i>kidda</i></b> indicates falling <b>upon</b> one’s <b>face, and so</b> the verse <b>states: “Then Bathsheba bowed [<i>vatikkod</i>] with her face to the ground”</b> (I Kings 1:31). <b><i>Keria</i></b> means descending <b>upon</b> one’s <b>knees, and so</b> the verse <b>states</b> with regard to Solomon: “He rose from before the altar of the Lord, <b>from kneeling [<i>mikero’a</i>] upon his knees”</b> (I Kings 8:54). <b><i>Hishtaḥava’a</i>, this</b> is prostrating oneself while <b>spreading </b>one’s <b>arms and legs</b> in total submission, <b>and so</b> the verse <b>states</b> that Jacob asked, in response to Joseph’s relating of his dream: <b>“Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down [<i>lehishtaḥavot</i>] to you to the ground”</b> (Genesis 37:10), i.e., spread out completely on the ground.
§ <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> Is <b>tarrying</b> long enough to bow down <b>necessary to</b> incur <b>lashes?</b> If one was warned not to remain in the Temple courtyard in a state of impurity, is he liable to receive lashes only if he remains there long enough to bow down, completely spread out on the ground? <b>Or</b> is <b>tarrying not necessary to</b> incur <b>lashes,</b> and he is immediately liable to receive lashes? The Gemara clarifies the two possibilities: Is it <b>learned</b> as a tradition that <b>tarrying</b> is necessary in order to incur liability <b>to</b> bring <b>an offering,</b> but <b>not learned</b> as a tradition that <b>tarrying</b> is necessary to become liable <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes?</b>

Daf 17a

<b>Or perhaps</b> it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that <b>tarrying</b> is necessary to incur any liability for impurity <b>within</b> the Temple, and <b>it is no different</b> whether the liability is <b>to</b> bring <b>an offering, and it is no different</b> whether it is <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes?</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rava raises</b> another <b>dilemma:</b> If an impure person <b>suspended himself in the airspace of</b> the Temple <b>courtyard</b> long enough to bow down, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>When</b> it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that an impure person is liable for <b>tarrying</b> in the Temple, is this only with regard to <b>tarrying that is suited for bowing;</b> but with regard to tarrying <b>that is not suited for bowing,</b> as in this case, where the person cannot bow down as long as he is suspended in the air, it <b>is not learned</b> as a tradition that one is liable? <b>Or perhaps</b> it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that there is liability for <b>tarrying within</b> the Temple, and <b>it is no different</b> whether the tarrying <b>is suited for bowing, and it is no different</b> whether the tarrying <b>is not suited for bowing.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Ashi</b> also <b>raises a dilemma</b> relating to this matter: If one <b>intentionally rendered himself ritually impure</b> while he was in the Temple courtyard, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to tarrying? Is it <b>learned</b> as a tradition that <b>tarrying</b> is necessary when one contracts impurity while in the Temple <b>in circumstances beyond his control,</b> but <b>not learned</b> as a tradition that <b>tarrying</b> is necessary when he renders himself impure <b>intentionally? Or perhaps</b> it <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that <b>tarrying</b> is necessary for any liability for impurity <b>within</b> the Temple, and <b>it is no different</b> whether the impurity was contracted <b>in circumstances beyond his control, and it is no different</b> whether it was contracted <b>intentionally.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Ashi raises</b> another <b>dilemma:</b> If <b>a nazirite,</b> who is prohibited from contracting impurity imparted by a corpse, found himself <b>alongside a grave, is tarrying</b> there <b>a necessary</b> condition for him <b>to</b> incur <b>lashes, or is</b> tarrying <b>not necessary,</b> and he is liable immediately? Is it <b>learned</b> as a tradition that <b>tarrying</b> is necessary <b>within</b> the Temple, but <b>not learned</b> as a tradition that <b>tarrying</b> is necessary <b>outside</b> the Temple, and the nazirite is liable immediately? <b>Or perhaps</b> it is <b>learned</b> as a tradition that <b>tarrying</b> is necessary for liability for impurity contracted <b>in circumstances beyond</b> one’s <b>control,</b> and <b>it is no different</b> whether the impurity was contracted <b>within</b> the Temple, <b>and it is no different</b> whether it was contracted <b>outside</b> the Temple. The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches: If, at the time that one was unaware either that he was impure, or that he was in the Temple, <b>he went out</b> by way of <b>a longer</b> route when he could have taken a shorter route, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sliding-scale offering. But if he left the Temple via <b>the shortest</b> way, he is <b>exempt. Rava says:</b> With regard to the <b>short</b> route, <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said</b> here that he is exempt for, this does not necessarily mean that he left the Temple as quickly as possible, as if he took the most direct route he is exempt <b>even</b> if he walked with exceedingly small steps, <b>heel to toe, and even</b> if it took him <b>all day long.</b>
<b>Rava raised a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>combining periods of tarrying,</b> each of which is less than the amount of time necessary to recite the second portion of the verse mentioned above (II Chronicles 7:3)? If an impure person tarried in the Temple for less than the amount of time needed to bow down, and then started to leave, and then tarried again for less than the amount of time needed to bow down, do those two periods of tarrying combine together, so that if he tarried in total long enough to bow down, he is liable? The Gemara challenges: <b>Let</b> Rava <b>resolve</b> his dilemma <b>from his own</b> statement with regard to one who left the Temple with small steps, heel to toe, as such a person tarries intermittently between steps. The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> Rava is referring to one <b>who did not tarry</b> at all, walking continuously without interruption, albeit slowly. When Rava raised his dilemma here, it was with regard to one who stopped walking altogether and tarried.
<b>Abaye raised a dilemma to Rabba</b> that is the very opposite of the dilemma raised by Rava: If the impure person quickly <b>went out the longer</b> way <b>in the measure of time</b> ordinarily needed to go out <b>the shortest</b> way, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>learned</b> as a tradition that he is liable for tarrying for a certain <b>measure</b> of time, <b>and if he went out the longer</b> way in the <b>measure</b> of time ordinarily needed to go out the <b>shortest</b> way, he is <b>exempt? Or perhaps</b> it is <b>learned</b> as a tradition <b>specifically</b> that if he left the <b>longer</b> way, he is <b>liable,</b> whereas if he left the <b>shortest</b> way, he is <b>exempt.</b> Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: The liability for leaving using <b>the longer</b> way <b>was not given so that it would be overridden for him;</b> i.e., he is liable if he exits via the longer way, even if he runs.
<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to this: But</b> as for this <i>halakha</i> <b>that we maintain,</b> that <b>an impure</b> priest <b>who</b> intentionally <b>served</b> in the Temple is liable <b>to</b> receive the punishment of <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>how can you find these</b> circumstances? <b>If he did not tarry</b> in the Temple long enough to bow down, <b>how could he have performed</b> any <b>service</b> in such a short period of time? And <b>if he tarried</b> long enough to bow down, <b>he is liable</b> to be punished with <b><i>karet</i>,</b> which is a more severe punishment than death at the hand of Heaven.
Rabbi Zeira explains his objection: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that it is <b>learned</b> as a tradition that one is liable for tarrying for a certain <b>measure</b> of time, and if he did not tarry for the time it takes to bow down and leave the Temple via the shortest way, he is exempt, then <b>you can find</b> a case where the priest could have served in a state of impurity without becoming liable to be punished with <i>karet</i>. The case is <b>where he exerted himself</b> and ran out very quickly via the <b>shortest</b> way after having <b>performed a service</b> in a state of impurity, so that the total time that he was in the Temple was less time than it would ordinarily take him to bow and leave the shortest way. In such a case he is exempt from being punished with <i>karet</i>, and liable only to be punished with death at the hand of Heaven for having performed the Temple service while impure.

Daf 17b

<b>But if you say that</b> it is <b>learned</b> as a tradition <b>specifically</b> that if an impure person tarries long enough to bow down, he is liable even if he does not exceed the time required to go out the shortest way, then <b>how can you find these</b> circumstances?
<b>Abaye said: What is the difficulty? You find it</b> in a case <b>such as</b> where <b>he went out</b> from the Temple via the <b>shortest</b> way, <b>but</b> as he was leaving <b>he turned over</b> one of the limbs of an offering on the altar <b>with a fork [<i>betzinnora</i>].</b> This is an action that takes only a brief moment to perform, <b>and</b> yet it is considered priestly service, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna. As Rav Huna says: A non-priest who turns over</b> part of an offering on the altar <b>with a fork is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty, because he engaged in Temple service restricted to priests.
The Gemara proceeds to analyze <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Huna says: A non-priest who turns over</b> part of an offering on the altar <b>with a fork is liable</b> to receive the <b>death</b> penalty. <b>What are the circumstances</b> of such a case? <b>If</b> in the event <b>that he had not turned it over,</b> the offering <b>would not have been consumed</b> by the fire, then it is <b>obvious</b> that the non-priest is liable, as he performed the service of burning the offering on the altar. <b>And if</b> in the event <b>that he had not turned it over, it would also have been consumed</b> by the fire, then <b>what</b> service <b>did he perform?</b> Even without his action, the offering would have been burned.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for Rav Huna to state this <i>halakha</i> with regard to a case <b>where, had</b> the non-priest <b>not turned it over, it would have been consumed</b> by the fire <b>in two hours, but now</b> that he turned it over, <b>it is consumed</b> by the fire <b>in one hour. And he teaches us this: That any</b> act <b>that accelerates the service,</b> causing it to be performed more quickly, <b>is</b> itself considered <b>a service.</b>
The Gemara returns to the general topic of one who enters the Temple while in a state of ritual impurity, citing <b>Rabbi Oshaya,</b> who <b>said: I wish to say something, but I am afraid of my colleagues,</b> i.e., I am afraid that they will raise an objection against me. What did he want to say? With regard to <b>one who enters a house afflicted with leprosy,</b> if he enters the house <b>backward,</b> then <b>even</b> if <b>his entire</b> body entered <b>except for his nose,</b> which remained outside the house, he remains <b>pure, as it is written: “He that enters into the house</b> all the time that it is shut up shall be impure until evening” (Leviticus 14:46), teaching that <b>the Torah prohibited,</b> i.e., conferred impurity, only with regard to <b>the normal manner of entering into</b> a house, i.e., face-first.
<b>But I am afraid of my colleagues,</b> as they might raise the following objection: <b>If so,</b> that the impurity depends on the person entering the house in the normal manner, then even if <b>his entire</b> body entered the house, he would <b>also</b> be pure, as he did not go into the house in the normal fashion. <b>Rava said:</b> This is not difficult, as if <b>his entire</b> body entered in this manner, he is impure, because he is <b>no worse</b> now, i.e., his <i>halakha</i> should be no more lenient, <b>than vessels that are in the house,</b> which become impure, <b>as it is written:</b> “And they shall empty the house…<b>so that all that is in the house shall not be made impure”</b> (Leviticus 14:36).
The Gemara comments: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Oshaya, that wherever entering is mentioned in the Torah, the reference is to the normal manner of entering: With regard to <b>those roofs</b> that covered the various chambers found in the Temple courtyard, <b>offerings of the most sacred order may not be eaten there,</b> on them, <b>and offerings of lesser sanctity may not be slaughtered there,</b> because those roofs do not have the sanctity of the Temple courtyard. <b>And a ritually impure person who enters the Sanctuary via</b> those <b>roofs is exempt, as it is stated</b> with regard to a woman who became ritually impure: <b>“And she shall not enter into the Sanctuary”</b> (Leviticus 12:4), teaching that <b>the Torah prohibited</b> only <b>the normal manner of entering</b> the Temple. So too, in the case of a house afflicted with leprosy, where mention is made of entering, only one who enters into the house in the normal manner becomes impure, as stated by Rabbi Oshaya.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>This</b> mitzva that the ritually impure must be sent out of the Temple <b>is the positive mitzva concerning the Temple for which</b> the Sanhedrin <b>is not liable</b> to bring a bull offering for an erroneous ruling. The Gemara asks: <b>To what does</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>refer when he says: This is</b> the positive mitzva concerning the Temple for which the Sanhedrin is not liable to bring a bull offering for an erroneous ruling? Where was it taught that there is such a mitzva for which they are not liable? The Gemara answers: <b>He is referring to</b> a mishna found <b>there</b> in tractate <i>Horayot</i> (8b), which teaches: The Sanhedrin <b>is not liable</b> to bring a bull offering for an erroneous ruling <b>with regard to a positive mitzva or prohibition concerning</b> ritual impurity <b>in the Temple,</b> as this offering is brought only for an erroneous ruling on a matter whose unwitting violation requires the bringing of a fixed sin-offering, and not a sliding-scale offering.
The mishna there continues: <b>And</b> one who is uncertain whether or not he unwittingly transgressed a prohibition that requires a sin-offering <b>does not bring a provisional guilt-offering for a positive mitzva or prohibition concerning</b> ritual impurity <b>in the Temple,</b> as this offering is brought only when certainty about the unwitting transgression would require a fixed sin-offering, not a sliding-scale offering. Unwitting transgression of a mitzva concerning ritual impurity in the Temple results in an obligation to bring a sliding-scale offering.
The mishna there continues: <b>But</b> the Sanhedrin <b>is liable</b> to bring a bull offering for an erroneous ruling <b>with regard to a positive mitzva or prohibition concerning a menstruating woman. And</b> one who is uncertain whether or not he unwittingly transgressed a prohibition that requires a sin-offering <b>brings a provisional guilt-offering for a positive mitzva or prohibition concerning a menstruating woman.</b>
<b>And</b> it is in reference to that mishna that the <i>tanna</i> in the mishna here <b>says: This</b> mitzva, that the ritually impure must be sent out of the Temple, <b>is the positive mitzva concerning the Temple for which</b> the Sanhedrin <b>is not liable</b> to bring a bull offering for an erroneous ruling. <b>And which is the positive mitzva with regard to a menstruating woman for which</b> the Sanhedrin is <b>liable</b> to bring a bull offering for an erroneous ruling? If a man <b>was engaging in intercourse with a ritually pure woman, and</b> during the course of their act of intercourse <b>she</b> experienced menstrual bleeding and <b>said to him: I have become impure, and</b> unwittingly <b>he immediately withdrew</b> from her and did not wait until his penis became flaccid, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for engaging in intercourse with a menstruating woman, <b>because his withdrawal</b> from her <b>is as pleasant to him as his entry.</b> If the Sanhedrin mistakenly ruled that one may withdraw immediately, they bring a bull offering for their erroneous ruling.
§ The Gemara further clarifies the matter of a man who immediately withdrew from the woman after she told him that she had experienced menstrual bleeding. <b>It was stated</b> that <b>Abaye says in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rav:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings for this unwitting transgression. <b>And so Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Shmuel bar Shaba says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings, <b>one for</b> his initial <b>entry and one for</b> his immediate <b>withdrawal.</b>
<b>Rabba discusses this</b> matter, raising a question: <b>About what</b> case are we speaking? <b>If we say</b> that it was <b>near her expected date</b> of menstruation, when sexual intercourse is prohibited due to a concern that the woman might already be menstruating or that she might begin to menstruate during the act of intercourse, and nevertheless they engaged in intercourse, there is a difficulty: <b>With whom</b> are we dealing? <b>If we say</b> that we are dealing <b>with a Torah scholar, granted</b> that <b>he will be liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for</b> his initial <b>entry.</b> That was an unwitting transgression, as <b>he thought</b> to himself: <b>I can engage in intercourse</b> with her before she begins to menstruate. <b>But why will he be liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for</b> his immediate <b>withdrawal?</b> That transgression was <b>intentional,</b> since he is a Torah scholar and he knows that in such a case he must not withdraw immediately, and a sin-offering is not brought for an intentional transgression.

Daf 18a

<b>And if</b> we say that we are dealing <b>with an <i>am ha’aretz</i>,</b> an ignoramus, who does not know that it is prohibited for him to engage in intercourse with a woman near the expected onset of her menstruation, and who also does not know that it is prohibited for him to immediately withdraw from her if she experiences menstrual bleeding during intercourse, then for both <b>this and that,</b> his entry and his withdrawal, he should be liable to bring only a single sin-offering, since he had no awareness of his transgression between his two actions. This <b>is</b> like one who <b>ate two olive-</b>bulks <b>of</b> forbidden <b>fat in</b> the course of <b>one lapse of awareness</b> and is therefore liable to bring only one sin-offering. Here too, although he performed two actions for which one could be liable to bring sin-offerings, entry and withdrawal, there was only one lapse of awareness.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be a case <b>where it was not near her expected date</b> of menstruation, and there was no reason for the man to think that the woman would experience menstrual bleeding. <b>And with whom</b> are we dealing? <b>If we say</b> that we are dealing with <b>a Torah scholar,</b> then <b>he should not be liable</b> to bring <b>even one</b> sin-offering, because <b>with regard to</b> his initial <b>entry,</b> he was <b>a victim of circumstances beyond his control,</b> and <b>with regard to</b> his <b>withdrawal,</b> after he knew that she was a menstruating woman, his transgression was <b>intentional,</b> and he would be liable to receive <i>karet</i>. And <b>if</b> we are dealing <b>with an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, he should be liable</b> to bring only <b>one</b> sin-offering, <b>for</b> his immediate <b>withdrawal.</b>
<b>Rava</b> reconsidered and <b>then said: Actually,</b> it is a case where it was <b>near the expected date of</b> the woman’s menstruation, <b>and</b> we are dealing <b>with a Torah scholar. But</b> he is <b>a Torah scholar</b> only <b>with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i>, that it is prohibited to engage in intercourse with a woman near the expected onset of her menstruation, and he erred in thinking that he could complete the act of intercourse before she experienced menstrual bleeding. Therefore, once he learns that she has experienced menstrual bleeding, he is liable to bring a sin-offering for his unwitting transgression at the time of his entry. <b>But</b> he is <b>not a Torah scholar with regard to that</b> <i>halakha</i>, that it is prohibited for one to immediately withdraw from a woman if she experiences menstrual bleeding during intercourse. Since he had awareness of his transgression between his two actions, this is not an instance of one lapse of awareness, and therefore he is liable to bring a second sin-offering for his unwitting transgression at the time of his withdrawal.
<b>Rava said: And we learn both of these</b> matters for which he is liable to bring a sin-offering; <b>we learn</b> about <b>entry,</b> and <b>we learn</b> about <b>withdrawal.</b> Rava now clarifies the matter: <b>We learn</b> about <b>withdrawal, as</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> If a man <b>was engaging in intercourse with a ritually pure woman, and</b> during the course of their act of intercourse <b>she</b> experienced menstrual bleeding and <b>said to him: I have become impure, and</b> unwittingly <b>he immediately withdrew</b> from her, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for engaging in intercourse with a menstruating woman.
Rava continues: <b>We learn</b> about <b>entry</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 14a): If a spot of blood <b>is found on his</b> rag, i.e., the rag that he uses to wipe his penis after intercourse, then it is clear that this blood came from the woman during their act of intercourse. Consequently, both the man and the woman <b>are impure and are liable to</b> bring a sin-<b>offering</b> for their unwitting transgression. Rava explains: <b>What, is it not</b> the case that the mishna speaks here of one who engaged in intercourse with a woman <b>near the expected date of</b> her menstruation, <b>and</b> it teaches that he is liable to bring a sin-offering <b>for</b> his initial <b>entry</b> at that time?
<b>Rav Adda bar Mattana said to Rava: Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that the mishna speaks here of one who engaged in intercourse with a woman <b>not near the expected date of</b> her menstruation, <b>and</b> he is liable to bring a sin-offering <b>for</b> his immediate <b>withdrawal</b> upon learning that she had experienced menstrual bleeding. <b>And if you would say: Why do I</b> need to be taught once again about <b>withdrawal? Didn’t</b> the <i>tanna</i> already <b>teach this</b> in the mishna here? One can respond: <b>It was necessary to teach us this,</b> i.e., the continuation of the mishna in tractate <i>Nidda</i>, which states: If a spot of blood <b>is found on her</b> rag, i.e., the rag that she uses to wipe herself after intercourse, <b>they are impure</b> only <b>because of an uncertainty,</b> as perhaps the bleeding commenced only after they completed their act of intercourse, <b>and</b> therefore <b>they are exempt from</b> bringing a sin-<b>offering. And since</b> the mishna <b>had to teach</b> the case where the blood <b>was found on her</b> rag, <b>it also taught</b> the case where <b>it was found on his</b> rag, even though there is no novel element in this ruling.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Adda: Can you</b> really <b>interpret that</b> mishna as referring to a case <b>where it was not near the expected date of</b> the woman’s menstruation, <b>and</b> that he is liable to bring a sin-offering <b>for</b> his <b>withdrawal? But isn’t it taught</b> in that mishna: If blood <b>is found</b> on his rag? <b>And</b> these words <b>indicate</b> that the blood <b>was found</b> only <b>afterward,</b> after the man had already withdrawn from the woman. That is to say, only after he withdrew from the woman he learned that she had experienced menstrual bleeding. Ravina clarifies the difficulty: <b>And if</b> the mishna is referring to a case where he is liable <b>for</b> his <b>withdrawal, at the outset, when he withdrew</b> from the woman, it was <b>from then that he had knowledge</b> of her menstrual status, as he withdrew because she had informed him that she had experienced bleeding. Of what significance is his finding blood on his rag?
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Adda: <b>Listen to what your teacher,</b> Ravina, <b>is saying,</b> as he has explained the matter. Rav Adda said to Rava: <b>How can I</b> listen to his words and accept his explanation? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> this mishna concerning blood found on a rag: <b>This is the positive mitzva with regard to a menstruating woman for which one is liable.</b> Rav Adda explains: <b>And if it is so</b> that the mishna is referring to a case where the man is liable for his initial entry, this wording is difficult, as engaging in intercourse with a menstruating woman <b>is</b> not the violation of a positive mitzva, but <b>a prohibition.</b>
Rava <b>said to him: If you learned</b> this <i>baraita</i> in this manner, its wording is imprecise, as <b>it is missing</b> words, <b>and you should teach</b> it <b>like this:</b> When blood is found on the man’s rag, <b>this is the prohibition with regard to a menstruating woman for which one is liable.</b> And additionally, if a man <b>was engaging in intercourse with a ritually pure woman, and</b> during the course of their act of intercourse <b>she</b> experienced menstrual bleeding and <b>said to him: I have become impure, and</b> unwittingly <b>he immediately withdrew</b> from her, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for that act, and <b>this is the positive mitzva</b> for which one is liable <b>with regard to a menstruating woman.</b>
§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the mishna: <b>The Master said</b> above in the mishna: If <b>he immediately withdrew</b> from the woman after having been informed that she had experienced menstrual bleeding, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for engaging in intercourse with a menstruating woman. The Gemara asks: <b>What should</b> one <b>do</b> in such a situation? <b>Rav Huna said in the name of Rava:</b> He should <b>press his ten fingernails into the ground,</b> i.e., the bed, and restrain himself and do nothing <b>until</b> his penis <b>becomes flaccid,</b> and only then should he withdraw from her, <b>and it is good for him</b> to do so.
<b>Rava said: That is to say, one who engages in intercourse, with a flaccid</b> penis, <b>with those with whom relations are forbidden</b> is <b>exempt. As if it enters your mind</b> to say that he is <b>liable, here,</b> in the mishna, <b>what is the reason</b> that he is <b>exempt</b> if he waits and withdraws only later, after he has lost his erection? You might say that <b>it is because he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control</b> in that the woman experienced menstrual bleeding while he was in the middle of the act of intercourse, and not because he withdrew with a flaccid penis, as one who engages in intercourse with a flaccid penis is liable. But <b>if</b> he is exempt from liability because <b>he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control,</b> then even <b>if he withdraws immediately,</b> before losing his erection, <b>he should also be exempt,</b> for the same reason, that <b>he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control.</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>one who engages in intercourse, with a flaccid</b> penis, <b>with those with whom relations are forbidden is liable. And here, what is the reason</b> that one who waits and withdraws only later, after he has lost his erection, is <b>exempt?</b> It is <b>because he is</b> considered <b>a victim of circumstances beyond his control. And</b> concerning <b>that which you said: Why,</b> then, is he <b>liable if he withdrew immediately,</b> i.e., when you said: He should also be exempt, it is because <b>he should have withdrawn with</b> a flaccid penis and experienced <b>little pleasure, but</b> instead <b>he withdrew with</b> an erect organ and experienced <b>great pleasure.</b>
<b>Rabba bar Ḥanan said to Abaye: If so,</b> according to your opinion, <b>we find</b> a difference in <i>halakha</i> between <b>a long</b> way <b>and a short</b> way <b>with regard to a menstruating woman.</b> If he withdrew the short way, i.e., without waiting, he has committed a transgression, and if he withdrew the long way, i.e., after waiting, he has not committed a transgression.

Daf 18b

<b>And we learned</b> this difference in the mishna specifically <b>with regard to</b> ritual impurity in <b>the Temple.</b> If such a distinction were also in effect with regard to a menstruating woman, the mishna would mention it. <b>Rather,</b> one can explain: No parallel distinction is made, <b>because</b> the two cases <b>are not similar</b> in their details. The <b>long</b> way <b>here,</b> with regard to a menstruating woman, namely, that the man must wait, is like the <b>shortest</b> way <b>there,</b> with regard to impurity in the Temple, namely, that the impure person must leave the Temple by way of the most direct route. <b>And</b> the <b>long</b> way <b>there,</b> with regard to the Temple, is like the <b>shortest</b> way <b>here,</b> with regard to a menstruating woman.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Natan, objects to</b> what Abaye said: <b>Did Abaye</b> really <b>say</b> with regard to the mishna that if the man withdraws with a flaccid penis he is exempt because <b>he is</b> considered <b>a victim of circumstances beyond his control? Apparently,</b> then, <b>we are speaking</b> of a man who engaged in intercourse with a woman <b>not near the expected date of</b> her menstruation, and therefore the situation is considered beyond his control. <b>But</b> is it not <b>Abaye who says</b> that he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sin-offerings for this transgression, one for his initial entry and one for his withdrawal? <b>Apparently, we are dealing with</b> a man who engaged in intercourse with a woman <b>near the expected date of</b> her menstruation, so he is considered an unwitting transgressor, who is liable to bring a sin-offering, and is not the victim of circumstances beyond his control. Consequently, Abaye’s two statements contradict each other.
The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> this statement <b>of Abaye was stated,</b> that the man is liable to bring two sin-offerings, it <b>was stated in general.</b> It was not relating to the case in the mishna, but was an independent ruling concerning one who engages in intercourse with a woman near the expected date of her menstruation.
§ <b>Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosei ben Lakonya asked Rabbi Shimon ben Yosei ben Lakonya: From where in the Torah</b> is the <b>prohibition concerning one who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman [<i>nidda</i>]</b> derived? Rabbi Shimon ben Yosei ben Lakonya <b>took a clod [<i>kala</i>]</b> of earth <b>and threw</b> it <b>at him</b> in reproach and said to him: Is there a need to search the Torah for a derivation for the <b>prohibition concerning one who engages in intercourse with a menstruating woman?</b> The verse states: <b>“And a woman who is impure by her uncleanness [<i>nidda</i>] you shall not approach,</b> to uncover her nakedness” (Leviticus 18:19)?
The Gemara explains the intent of the question of Rabbi Yonatan ben Yosei ben Lakonya: <b>Rather, from where do we</b> derive the <b>prohibition with regard to</b> the case in the mishna concerning one who <b>was engaging in intercourse with a ritually pure woman, and she</b> experienced menstrual bleeding and <b>said to him: I have become impure, that he must not withdraw immediately?</b> In response to this question <b>Ḥizkiyya said: The verse states:</b> “And if any man lies with her, <b>and her menstrual flow shall be upon him”</b> (Leviticus 15:24), teaching that <b>even</b> at any time <b>when she is menstruating,</b> the prohibition <b>shall be upon him;</b> therefore, he must not withdraw from her immediately.
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for <b>a positive mitzva</b> with regard to the manner in which one must withdraw from a menstruating woman; <b>from where do we</b> derive that immediate withdrawal is also subject to <b>a prohibition? Rav Pappa said: The verse states:</b> “And a woman who is impure by her uncleanness <b>you shall not approach,</b> to uncover her nakedness” (Leviticus 18:19). The Gemara explains: <b>“You shall not approach [<i>tikrav</i>]”</b> means <b>also</b> the opposite: <b>You shall not withdraw, as it is written: “Those who say: Withdraw [<i>kerav</i>] to yourself, come not near to me, for I am holier than you”</b> (Isaiah 65:5), where “<i>kerav</i>” means remove or withdraw.
§ Having mentioned that it is prohibited for a man to engage in intercourse with a woman near the expected date of her menstruation, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> in which <b>the Sages taught:</b> The verse with regard to a menstruating woman states: <b>“And shall you separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness”</b> (Leviticus 15:31), <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says: From here</b> we derive <b>a prohibition to the children of Israel that they must separate from their wives near the expected date of</b> their menstruation. <b>And how long</b> before must they separate? <b>Rabba says: A set interval of time</b> for the ritual impurity of a menstruating woman, which is half of a twenty-four hour day, either the daytime or the nighttime.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who does not separate from his wife near the expected date of</b> her menstruation, <b>even</b> if <b>he has sons</b> who are fit to be great and holy <b>like the sons of Aaron,</b> these sons <b>will die</b> due to his sin, <b>as it is written: “And shall you separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness…</b>this is the law…<b>of her that is sick with her menstrual flow”</b> (Leviticus 15:31–33), <b>and</b> it is stated <b>near it: “After the death of</b> the two sons of Aaron” (Leviticus 16:1).
Concerning this matter, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who separates himself from his wife near the expected date of</b> her menstruation <b>will have male children, as it is written: “To distinguish between the impure and the pure”</b> (Leviticus 11:47), <b>and</b> it is stated <b>near it: “If a woman conceive and bear a male child”</b> (Leviticus 12:2). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: He will have sons who are worthy of teaching</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>as it is written: “To distinguish…</b>between the impure and the pure, <b>and to teach</b> the children of Israel all the statutes” (Leviticus 10:10–11).
The Gemara continues to expound these verses: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who recites <i>havdala</i> over wine at the conclusion of <i>Shabbatot</i>,</b> and not over some other beverage, <b>will have male children, as it is written: “To distinguish between the holy and the unholy,</b> and between the impure and the pure” (Leviticus 10:10), <b>and it is written there</b> once again: <b>“To distinguish between the impure and the pure”</b> (Leviticus 11:47), <b>and</b> it is stated <b>near it: “If a woman conceive</b> and bear a male child” (Leviticus 12:2). <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> Anyone who recites <i>havdala</i> over wine at the conclusion of <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>will have sons who are worthy of teaching</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>as it is written: “To distinguish</b> between the holy and the unholy…<b>and to teach”</b> (Leviticus 10:10–11).
<b>Rabbi Binyamin bar Yefet says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Anyone who sanctifies himself</b> with modest conduct <b>while engaging in sexual intercourse will have male children, as it is stated: “You shall sanctify yourselves, and you shall be holy”</b> (Leviticus 11:44), <b>and</b> it is stated <b>near it: “If a woman conceive</b> and bear a male child” (Leviticus 12:2).
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to the sliding-scale offering the verse states: “Or if a person touches any impure thing, whether it is the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher <b>creeping animal, and it is hidden from him,</b> so that he is impure” (Leviticus 5:2). The juxtaposition of the words “and it is hidden” to the words “a creeping animal” teaches that one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering when it was hidden from him that he had contracted ritual impurity from a creeping animal, but not when it was hidden from him that he was entering the Temple or partaking of sacrificial food. Rabbi Akiva says that it is from the words “and it is hidden from him, so that he is impure” that it is derived that one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering for a lapse of awareness about his impurity, but not for a lapse of awareness about the Temple or the sacrificial food. The Gemara asks: Since Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva agree about the <i>halakha</i>, <b>what is</b> the practical difference <b>between them?</b>
<b>Ḥizkiyya says: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case where one initially knew that he had contracted ritual impurity, but he did not know whether the impurity was contracted from <b>a creeping animal or</b> from <b>the carcass of an unslaughtered animal. Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that for him to be liable to bring an offering, <b>we require that he</b> initially <b>know whether he contracted impurity from a creeping animal or he contracted impurity from an unslaughtered animal carcass,</b> and if he never knew this, he does not bring an offering. <b>And Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that for him to be liable to bring an offering, <b>we do not require that he know</b> this detail; <b>since he knows in general</b> terms <b>that he contracted impurity,</b> it is <b>not necessary</b> that one know <b>whether he contracted the impurity from a creeping animal or he contracted the impurity from an unslaughtered animal carcass.</b>
<b>And Ulla also says: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case where the person did not know whether he contracted impurity from <b>a creeping animal or</b> from <b>the carcass of an unslaughtered animal. Ulla</b> did not say this explicitly, but rather he <b>raises a contradiction</b> between this statement <b>of Rabbi Eliezer and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Eliezer, and</b> then <b>resolves</b> it. He asked: <b>Does Rabbi Eliezer</b> actually <b>say</b> that in order to be liable to bring a sliding-scale offering, <b>we require that</b> one initially <b>know whether he contracted impurity from a creeping animal or he contracted impurity from an unslaughtered animal carcass?</b>
<b>And he raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> with regard to one who ate a forbidden food but did not know whether it was forbidden fat or it was <i>notar</i>, part of a sacrifice left over after the time allotted for its consumption; or one who performed labor but did not know whether it was Shabbat or Yom Kippur; or one who engaged in intercourse but did not know whether it was with his menstruating wife or with his sister. In all these cases Rabbi Eliezer holds that he must bring a sin-offering, whereas Rabbi Yehoshua deems him exempt. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Whichever way you</b> look at it, he is liable. If he <b>ate forbidden fat</b> he is <b>liable;</b> if he <b>ate <i>notar</i></b> he is <b>liable.</b> If he <b>desecrated Shabbat</b> he is <b>liable;</b> if he <b>desecrated Yom Kippur</b> he is <b>liable.</b> If <b>he engaged in intercourse with his menstruating wife,</b> he is <b>liable;</b> if <b>he engaged in intercourse with his sister,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> In all these cases, he knows that he transgressed, and he is liable to bring a sin-offering.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: The verse <b>states</b> with regard to a sin-offering: <b>“Or if his sin, in which he sinned, became known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:23), teaching that there is no liability for an offering <b>until it becomes known to</b> the sinner the manner <b>in which he sinned.</b> According to this <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Eliezer himself holds that in order to become liable to bring a sin-offering, it is not necessary that one know precisely which prohibition he violated.
<b>And</b> Ulla <b>resolves</b> the contradiction: <b>There,</b> with regard to liability to bring a sin-offering, <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “Or if his sin, <b>in which he sinned,</b> became known to him, <b>he shall bring</b> his offering” (Leviticus 4:23), teaching that it suffices that he knows that he committed <b>some</b> type of <b>sin. Here,</b> with regard to ritual impurity in the Temple, <b>since it is written</b> at the beginning of the verse: “Or if a person touches <b>any impure thing”</b> (Leviticus 5:2), <b>why do I</b> need that which is stated immediately afterward: <b>“Or the carcass of a non-kosher creeping animal”? Conclude from it</b> that <b>we require that he</b> initially <b>know whether he contracted impurity from a creeping animal or he contracted impurity from an unslaughtered animal carcass,</b> and if he never knew this, he does not bring an offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Akiva,</b> who does not expound the verses in this way, what does he say to this? The Gemara answers: He maintains that <b>since</b>

Daf 19a

the Torah <b>needs to write</b> both <b>“domesticated animal” and “undomesticated animal”</b> in the verse “or the carcass of a non-kosher undomesticated animal, or the carcass of a non-kosher domesticated animal” <b>to</b> teach that <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> the school of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi taught (see 7a), <b>“creeping animal” is also written,</b> even though there is no novel element taught by the addition of that term. This is <b>in accordance with what was taught</b> in <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael: Every passage</b> in the Torah <b>that was stated and repeated was repeated only for the novel element introduced therein.</b> It is the style of the Torah to repeat an entire passage to teach even one additional <i>halakha</i>, in this case, that which was taught by Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who maintains that in general it is not necessary that the unwitting transgressor know precisely which prohibition he violated, <b>what does he do with</b> the words <b>“in which</b> he sinned,” the words from which Rabbi Yehoshua learned that there is no liability to bring an offering unless he knows precisely which sin he committed? The Gemara answers: According to Rabbi Eliezer, these words emphasize the fact that one is liable only when he intends to do the prohibited act, <b>to the exclusion of one who acts unawares</b> and has no intention to perform the action. That is to say, if one was preoccupied with another matter and, acting unawares, he transgressed a prohibition, he is not liable to bring a sin-offering.
Until now the Gemara has discussed Ḥizkiyya’s understanding of the practical difference between the opinions of Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva in the mishna. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> There is no halakhic difference between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva, as they both agree that one must know the exact source of his ritual impurity. The difference <b>between them</b> is limited to <b>the interpretation of the meaning</b> of the verses, i.e., they disagree about the source in the Torah for this <i>halakha</i>. <b>And similarly,</b> it can be reasoned that <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> The difference <b>between them</b> is limited to <b>the interpretation of the meaning</b> of the verses, <b>as Rav Sheshet would switch</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer for</b> that of <b>Rabbi Akiva and</b> that <b>of Rabbi Akiva for</b> that of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b> He was not meticulous in his attributions of the respective opinions, as he held that there is no halakhic difference between them.
<b>Rava asked Rav Naḥman:</b> According to both Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva, if <b>one had a lapse of awareness of</b> both <b>this and that,</b> his having contracted ritual impurity and his having entered the Temple, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: He has a lapse of awareness about</b> his <b>impurity,</b> and therefore he is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara disputes this: <b>On the contrary, he has a lapse of awareness about the Temple, and</b> he should therefore be <b>exempt.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said: We observe</b> his behavior. <b>If he leaves</b> the Temple <b>because of the impurity,</b> i.e., when he is told that he is impure, it is clear that <b>the lapse of awareness</b> that <b>he had is about the impurity, and</b> he is <b>liable.</b> And <b>if he leaves because of the Temple,</b> i.e., when he is told that he is in the Temple, then <b>the lapse of awareness</b> that <b>he had is about the Temple, and</b> he is <b>exempt. Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> There is no indication from here; <b>didn’t he leave because</b> he became aware of the <b>Temple only because</b> he became aware also <b>of the impurity?</b> Otherwise, why would he leave the Temple? And <b>didn’t he leave because</b> he became aware of the <b>impurity only because</b> he became aware also of the <b>Temple?</b> Otherwise, why would he leave the Temple? <b>Rather, there is no difference,</b> so there is no indication from here.
§ The Gemara begins a discussion about another topic related to awareness of impurity. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there were <b>two paths</b> in a certain place, <b>one</b> of them <b>impure,</b> as a corpse was buried there, <b>and</b> the other <b>one pure,</b> but it was not clear which of the two paths was impure, <b>and</b> someone <b>walked on the first</b> path <b>and did not</b> then <b>enter</b> the Temple, and then afterward he walked <b>on the second</b> path, forgot that he was ritually impure, <b>and entered</b> the Temple, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering, since he certainly contracted impurity on one of the paths and entered the Temple in a state of impurity.
If <b>he walked on the first</b> path <b>and entered</b> the Temple, and on the third day he was <b>sprinkled</b> with waters of purification to purify him from the uncertain impurity imparted by a corpse, <b>and</b> on the seventh day he was sprinkled upon <b>again, and he immersed</b> himself in a ritual bath, thereby completing his purification, <b>and</b> then <b>afterward he walked on the second</b> path <b>and entered</b> the Temple, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering, since one of the paths was certainly impure and he entered the Temple after having walked on it. <b>Rabbi Shimon deems him exempt</b> in this latter case, because neither time that he entered the Temple was it certain that he was impure, the first time because he might not yet have become impure, and the second time because he might already have purified himself. <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda, in the name of Rabbi Shimon, deems him exempt in all of</b> these cases.
The Gemara asks: Does Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda really exempt him <b>in all of</b> these cases,

Daf 19b

<b>even in the first</b> case, where he walked on both of the paths and did not purify himself in between? This is difficult, as <b>whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, <b>he is impure,</b> since he certainly contracted impurity on one of the two paths. <b>Rava said: What are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he walked on the first</b> path, <b>and</b> then afterward <b>when he was walking on the second</b> path <b>he forgot that he had</b> already <b>walked on the first</b> path, <b>so that</b> his lapse of awareness when he entered the Temple <b>was</b> only a lapse of <b>partial awareness.</b> That is, when he entered the Temple he forgot only that he had walked on the first path, and for this lapse of knowledge by itself he is not liable to bring a sin-offering, as it is not certain that he contracted impurity there.
Rava continues: <b>And</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to this</b> issue: <b>The first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who teaches that Rabbi Shimon deems the person exempt only where there was purification between the two entries, but not in the first case, <b>maintains</b> that <b>we say</b> that <b>partial awareness</b> of definite impurity <b>is</b> counted <b>as complete awareness. And Rabbi Shimon</b> ben Yehuda, who teaches that Rabbi Shimon deems the person exempt even in the first case, where there was no purification between the two entries, <b>maintains</b> that <b>we do not say</b> that <b>partial awareness</b> of definite impurity <b>is</b> counted <b>as complete awareness.</b>
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches: If <b>he walked on the first</b> path <b>and entered</b> the Temple, and on the third day he was <b>sprinkled</b> with waters of purification, <b>and</b> on the seventh day he was sprinkled upon <b>again, and he immersed</b> himself in a ritual bath, <b>and</b> then <b>he walked on the second</b> path <b>and entered</b> the Temple, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering; <b>and Rabbi Shimon deems him exempt</b> from bringing an offering. The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is he <b>liable</b> according to the first <i>tanna</i>? Each time he entered the Temple <b>it was</b> only with a lapse of <b>awareness</b> of <b>uncertain</b> impurity, the first time because he might not yet have become impure, and the second time because he might already have purified himself.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Here,</b> since he certainly contracted impurity on one of the paths and entered the Temple in a state of impurity, <b>they made awareness</b> of <b>uncertain</b> impurity <b>like awareness</b> of <b>definite</b> impurity. <b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says: We do not require</b> any <b>awareness</b> of impurity whatsoever <b>at the beginning,</b> before he enters the Temple, and it suffices if it becomes known to him at the end that he had been impure at the time of his entry.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between this statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan and</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan; and</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between this statement <b>of Reish Lakish and</b> another statement <b>of Reish Lakish. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>ate</b> an item concerning which there was <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether or not it was <b>forbidden fat, and</b> he later <b>became aware</b> of it, and then he ate some other item concerning which there was <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether or not it was <b>forbidden fat, and</b> he later <b>became aware</b> of it, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Just as he would bring a sin-offering for each and every one</b> of his instances of consumption were he to learn that what he ate was actually forbidden fat, <b>so</b> too, <b>he brings a provisional guilt-offering,</b> brought by one who is uncertain as to whether he committed a transgression that requires a sin-offering, <b>for each and every one</b> of his instances of consumption if after each instance he became aware that he might have eaten forbidden fat.
<b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, said in the name of Rabbi Shimon: He brings only one provisional guilt-offering, as it is stated</b> with regard to a provisional guilt-offering: “He shall bring an unblemished ram…for a guilt-offering…to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him <b>concerning his unwitting transgression wherein he unwittingly transgressed</b> and knew it not” (Leviticus 5:18). This wording teaches that <b>the Torah included many instances of unwitting</b> transgressions <b>in one provisional guilt-offering.</b> One brings one provisional guilt-offering even if he had committed many unwitting transgressions.
Reish Lakish and Rabbi Yoḥanan disagree about how to understand the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: With regard to which case did he say that one brings a separate sin-offering for each and every one of his instances of consumption? <b>And Reish Lakish says: Here Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught</b> that <b>awareness</b> of the <b>uncertain</b> status <b>separates</b> the acts <b>with regard to sin-offerings.</b> If it later became known with certainty that he had actually eaten forbidden fat both times, he would be liable to bring two sin-offerings for the two instances of consumption, despite the fact that the two actions were separated only by awareness of the uncertain status, because such awareness is sufficient to separate the two acts.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does not mean to say that awareness of the uncertain status separates the acts with regard to sin-offerings. He merely established the principle: <b>Just as definite awareness in general separates</b> the acts <b>with regard to sin-offerings,</b> e.g., where one ate forbidden fat and then became aware that it was definitely forbidden fat that he had eaten, and then he forgot and once again ate forbidden fat, <b>so</b> too, <b>awareness</b> of the <b>uncertain</b> status <b>separates</b> the acts <b>with regard to provisional guilt-offerings.</b> But awareness of the uncertain status does not separate the acts with regard to sin-offerings. If the awareness between the acts was only awareness of the uncertain status, he does not bring a sin-offering for each act when he later learns with certainty that it was forbidden fat that he had eaten. Evidently, Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that awareness of the uncertain status is not like definite awareness, and Reish Lakish maintains that it is like definite awareness. This contradicts what they said above.
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted,</b> the apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as one can explain that Rabbi Yoḥanan is precise in his wording, as he says: <b>Here,</b> with regard to impurity in the Temple, <b>they made</b> awareness of the uncertain status like definite awareness; <b>but they did not do</b> so <b>everywhere in the entire Torah.</b> There is a basis for this distinction, as <b>here,</b> with regard to impurity in the Temple, <b>awareness</b> at the beginning <b>is not written explicitly</b> in the Torah, but rather <b>it is derived from: “And it is hidden</b> from him” (Leviticus 5:2), which indicates that there must be some awareness that became hidden from him, and for this, awareness of the uncertain status suffices. <b>But</b> by contrast, <b>they did not make</b> awareness of the uncertain status like definite awareness <b>everywhere in the entire Torah, as it is written: “Or</b> if his sin, which he has sinned, <b>becomes known to him”</b> (Leviticus 4:28), which indicates that in general <b>we require full-fledged awareness</b> at the beginning.
<b>But</b> as for <b>Reish Lakish, rather than interpreting</b> this <i>baraita</i> concerning the two paths <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who does not require any awareness whatsoever at the beginning, <b>let him interpret it in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that awareness of the uncertain status is like definite awareness. The Gemara explains: Reish Lakish <b>teaches us this: That</b> with regard to impurity in the Temple, <b>Rabbi Yishmael does not require</b> any <b>awareness at the beginning.</b>
The Gemara challenges: It is <b>obvious that</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>does not require</b> awareness at the beginning, <b>since he has no superfluous verses</b> from which to derive such a requirement. Rabbi Akiva learns from the superfluous phrase: <b>“And it is hidden</b> from him” (Leviticus 5:4), that awareness at the beginning is necessary, but Rabbi Yishmael says the verse serves to teach another <i>halakha</i>, <b>that one is liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for a lapse of awareness</b> that he was entering <b>the Temple.</b> The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>Lest you say: When</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>does not accept</b> this <i>halakha</i> requiring awareness at the beginning, it means that he does not derive it <b>from a verse, but he accepts</b> it <b>as a tradition;</b> to counter this, Reish Lakish <b>teaches us</b> that according to Rabbi Yishmael there is no requirement whatsoever for awareness at the beginning.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>oaths</b> attesting to the truth about an utterance, which, when violated, render one liable to bring a sliding-scale offering, there are <b>two</b> types <b>that are</b> actually <b>four</b> types. The initial two oaths, which relate to utterances about the future and are explicitly prohibited in the Torah, are: On my <b>oath I will eat, or:</b> On my oath <b>I will not eat.</b> These are expanded to four, to include oaths concerning utterances about the past: On my oath <b>I ate, or:</b> On my oath <b>I did not eat.</b>
If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and he</b> then <b>ate any amount,</b> even less than an olive-bulk, he is <b>liable;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b> The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Akiva: Where do we find that</b> one who <b>eats any amount is liable,</b> leading you to say <b>that this</b> person is <b>liable? Rabbi Akiva said to them: And where do we find one who speaks and</b> is liable to <b>bring an offering</b> for it, <b>as this</b> oath taker merely <b>speaks,</b> i.e., takes an oath, <b>and brings an offering</b> for it?
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that</b> phrasing an oath as: On my oath <b>I will eat,</b> always <b>means that</b> I take an oath that <b>I will eat?</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 16a): If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat of yours,</b> or: On my <b>oath I will eat of yours,</b> or: <b>Not</b> on my <b>oath I will not eat of yours,</b> the food of the other person is <b>forbidden.</b>
<b>Abaye said: Actually,</b> saying: On my oath I will eat, <b>means that</b> I take an oath that <b>I will eat.</b> It is <b>not difficult,</b> because there is a difference between the contexts of the <i>mishnayot</i>: <b>Here,</b> it is referring to an oath taken <b>in</b> a context where others <b>are importuning him to eat,</b> so when he says: On my oath I will eat of yours, his intention is to indicate his refusal to eat. <b>There,</b> it is a context <b>where</b> others <b>are not</b>

Daf 20a

<b>importuning [<i>mesarevin</i>] him to eat.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>The mishna</b> here is referring to a case <b>where</b> others <b>are not importuning him to eat;</b> therefore, his oath should be understood literally, as obligating himself to eat. The <b>external</b> mishna, in tractate <i>Nedarim</i>, is referring to a case <b>where</b> others <b>are importuning him to eat and he is saying: I will not eat, I will not eat.</b> Under those circumstances, <b>when he takes an oath, this</b> is what he <b>is saying:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi,</b> offering a different resolution of the contradiction, <b>says: Teach,</b> i.e., revise the mishna in tractate <i>Nedarim</i> to say in the middle oath: On my <b>oath I will not [<i>she’i</i>] eat of yours,</b> i.e., using a different formulation for: On my oath I will not eat of yours. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> what is effectively the same oath twice? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that there is a concern that the oath was <b>a slip of his tongue</b> and he meant to take an oath that he will eat and instead said: I will not eat, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that one need not be concerned that this is what occurred.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> “The <b>clear utterance</b> of her lips, with which she has bound her soul” (Numbers 30:7), is referring to <b>an oath,</b> and: <b>“A bond</b> with which she has bound her soul” (Numbers 30:5), is also referring to <b>an oath.</b> With regard to <b>the prohibition</b> invoked by the word <b>“bond,” if you say a bond is an oath,</b> he is <b>liable, but if not,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara seeks to explicate this <i>baraita</i>: <b>If you say a bond is an oath? But you</b> already <b>said</b> that <b>a bond is an oath.</b>
<b>Abaye said: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: “Clear utterance”</b> is <b>an oath,</b> whereas <b>“bond” is</b> the <b>association</b> of some object or action <b>with</b> a matter that has already been prohibited by <b>an oath.</b> What is the <b>prohibition</b> invoked by the word <b>“bond”? If you say</b> that creating <b>an association with an oath is like</b> explicitly <b>expressing an oath with his</b> own <b>mouth</b> then he is <b>liable</b> to bring an offering for unwittingly violating the oath and to receive lashes for doing so intentionally. <b>But if</b> it is <b>not</b> like stating an oath explicitly, he is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara analyzes Abaye’s explanation: <b>From where</b> may one derive that <b>“clear utterance” is an oath?</b> One derives it from the verse written with regard to an oath on an utterance, <b>as it is written: “Or if anyone take an oath to clearly utter with his lips”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). The Gemara asks: Isn’t <b>“bond” also</b> referring to an oath, <b>as it is written: “Every vow, and every oath of a bond</b> to afflict the soul, her husband may let it stand, or her husband may make it void” (Numbers 30:14)?
<b>Rather, from where</b> may one derive <b>that a bond is</b> the <b>association</b> of some object or action <b>with</b> another matter that has been prohibited by <b>an oath?</b> One may derive it from the verse, <b>as it is written: “Or bound her soul by a bond with an oath”</b> (Numbers 30:11), which indicates that the bond is associated with a preexisting oath.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t the term <b>“clear utterance” also</b> associated with an oath in a verse, as <b>it is written: “Whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath”</b> (Leviticus 5:4)?
<b>Rather, Abaye said:</b> The fact that <b>“clear utterance”</b> means <b>an oath</b> is derived <b>from here: “And if she be married to a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the clear utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul”</b> (Numbers 30:7). <b>While</b> in that verse, it <b>does not state: Oath. With what does she impose a prohibition upon herself?</b> She does so <b>with “clear utterance,”</b> indicating that “clear utterance” is referring to an oath.
<b>Rava said: Actually, I will say to you</b> that <b>association with an oath is not like expressing an oath with one’s</b> own <b>mouth, and this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: “Clear utterance”</b> is <b>an oath. “Bond”</b> can <b>also</b> be <b>an oath,</b> but it is ambiguous. <b>The verse placed</b> the wording of <b>the prohibition of a bond between</b> that of <b>a vow and</b> that of <b>an oath.</b> Therefore, if one <b>expressed</b> a bond <b>with the language of a vow,</b> it is <b>a vow.</b> If one expressed it <b>with the language of an oath,</b> it is <b>an oath.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Where did</b> the verse <b>place</b> the word for “bond” between a vow and an oath? The verse says: <b>“And if she vowed in her husband’s house or bound her soul by a bond with an oath”</b> (Numbers 30:11).
The Gemara comments: Abaye and Rava both <b>follow their</b> own lines of <b>reasoning, as it was stated:</b> With regard to one who <b>associates</b> some object or action <b>with</b> another matter that has been prohibited by <b>an oath, Abaye says:</b> It <b>is like</b> explicitly <b>expressing an oath with his mouth, and Rava says: It is not like</b> explicitly <b>expressing an oath with his mouth.</b>
<b>The Gemara raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is the bond mentioned in the Torah?</b> A bond applies to <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me that I will not eat meat and that I will not drink wine like</b> on <b>the day that his,</b> i.e., my, <b>father died,</b> or: <b>Like</b> on <b>the day that so-and-so died,</b> or: <b>Like</b> on <b>the day that Gedaliah ben Ahikam was killed,</b> or: <b>Like</b> on <b>the day</b> on <b>which he saw Jerusalem in its destruction.</b> One who makes one of these pronouncements is <b>prohibited</b> from eating meat and drinking wine. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> This <b>is</b> the case only <b>when he is prohibited</b> from eating meat and drinking wine <b>by vow since that day,</b> e.g., the day his father died.
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye, from</b> the fact that a vow <b>that one associates with</b> another <b>vow</b> is considered <b>a vow,</b> as Shmuel’s ruling demonstrates, one may conclude that an oath that <b>one associates with</b> another <b>oath</b> is considered <b>an oath.</b>

Daf 20b

<b>But according to Rava’s</b> opinion, that association with an oath is not considered an oath, the <i>baraita</i> poses <b>a difficulty,</b> as it indicates that association with a vow is considered a vow; a corresponding rule should apply to an oath.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you: Resolve</b> the difficulty posed by the <i>baraita</i> <b>and say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> teaches <b>this: Which is the bond</b> of <b>a vow mentioned in the Torah?</b> When is a bond, i.e., the acceptance of a prohibition on oneself, considered a vow? According to Rava, “bond” in the verse is not referring to association. Rather, it is referring to <b>one who says: It</b> is incumbent <b>upon me that I will not eat meat and that I will not drink wine like</b> on <b>the day that his,</b> i.e., my, <b>father died,</b> or: <b>Like</b> on <b>the day that so-and-so was killed. And Shmuel says:</b> This <b>is</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>when he is prohibited</b> from eating meat and drinking wine <b>by vow since that day,</b> e.g., the day his father died.
<b>What is the reason</b> for Shmuel’s caveat? <b>The verse states: “When a man vows a vow to the Lord”</b> (Numbers 30:3). The redundancy in the phrase “vows a vow” teaches that when one associates a vow with another prohibition, it does not take effect <b>unless he vows by</b> associating it with <b>an item</b> forbidden <b>by</b> means of <b>a vow.</b> Association is derived from this verse and is limited to vows.
The Gemara discusses the <i>baraita</i>: One who says: It is incumbent upon me that I will not eat meat and that I will not drink wine <b>like</b> on <b>the day that his father died.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that he is prohibited from eating meat and drinking wine? Why does the <i>baraita</i> need to mention the specific example of a vow concerning the day his father died? The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> that the <i>baraita</i> state that the vow takes effect for the sake of the other example: <b>Like</b> on <b>the day that Gedaliah ben Ahikam was killed.</b> Otherwise, it <b>may enter your mind to say: Since,</b> even <b>if he did not vow</b> to refrain from eating meat or drinking wine on that day <b>they would be prohibited to him anyway,</b> as it is a public fast day, <b>when he did vow</b> to refrain from eating and drinking on that day, the <b>prohibition</b> of the vow <b>would not take effect on him, and that</b> subsequent vow would then <b>not be associated with a vow,</b> but with an ordinary prohibition. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the vow made on the fast day takes effect and the second vow can be associated with it.
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds in accordance with this</b> opinion <b>of Rava</b> that a bond is not an association with an oath, but an oath itself, <b>as when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one says: By my <b>clear utterance I will not eat of yours,</b> or: On my <b>bond I will not eat of yours,</b> it is <b>an oath.</b>
§ <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one takes an oath, saying: <b>I will eat, or: I will not eat,</b> relating to the future, and does not fulfill it, it is <b>a false</b> oath. <b>And its prohibition</b> in the Torah is <b>from here:</b> “And <b>you shall not take an oath by My name falsely,</b> so that you profane the name of your God; I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:12). If one takes an oath, saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat,</b> relating to past actions, and it is a lie, it is an oath taken <b>in vain, and its prohibition</b> in the Torah is <b>from here: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain;</b> for the Lord will not absolve of guilt he that takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7).
Rav Dimi continued: With regard to vows where one states that an item is forbidden <b>like an offering [<i>konamot</i>],</b> if he subsequently derives benefit from that item, one <b>violates</b> the prohibition: “When a man vows a vow to the Lord, or takes an oath to bind his soul with a bond, <b>he shall not break his word;</b> he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth” (Numbers 30:3).
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The prohibitions against taking an oath <b>in vain and</b> taking <b>a false</b> oath <b>are one.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>What, is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> teaching <b>that</b> if an oath taken <b>in vain</b> refers <b>to the past, a false</b> oath <b>also</b> refers <b>to the past? Apparently,</b> the statements: <b>I ate,</b> and: <b>I did not eat, are</b> both <b>false</b> oaths, contrary to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that a false oath is one that relates to the future.
The Gemara answers: <b>Are the cases comparable? This</b> case, of a false oath, is <b>as it is and that</b> case, of an oath taken in vain, is <b>as it is. What,</b> then, is the meaning of the assertion of the <i>baraita</i> that <b>they are one?</b> It is <b>that</b> both <b>were spoken in a single utterance</b> at the giving of the Torah, <b>like that</b> which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Remember</b> the Sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Exodus 20:8), <b>and: “Observe</b> the Sabbath day, to keep it holy” (Deuteronomy 5:12), <b>were spoken in one utterance,</b> in a manner <b>that the</b> human <b>mouth cannot say and that the</b> human <b>ear cannot hear.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, there,</b> “remember” and “observe” <b>were spoken in a single utterance</b> in order to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>that Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> says; <b>as Rav Adda bar Ahava says: Women are obligated to</b> recite <b><i>kiddush</i></b> sanctifying <b>the</b> seventh <b>day, by Torah law,</b> even though it is a positive, time-bound mitzva, <b>since the verses state: “Remember,” and: “Observe,”</b> indicating that <b>anyone who is</b> obligated <b>to observe,</b> i.e., is prohibited from performing labor on Shabbat, <b>is</b> obligated <b>to remember,</b> by reciting <i>kiddush</i>. <b>And these women, since they are</b> obligated <b>to observe, they also are</b> obligated <b>to remember. But here,</b> with regard to the prohibitions against taking a false oath and taking an oath in vain, <b>for what <i>halakha</i> is it necessary</b> for them to have been spoken in a single utterance?
The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> the two prohibitions were spoken together to teach that <b>just as</b> one <b>is flogged for</b> taking an oath <b>in vain, so</b> is one <b>also flogged for</b> taking <b>a false</b> oath.
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t it the opposite [<i>kelapei layya</i>]?</b> It is clear that one receives lashes for taking a false oath about the future, which one violates with an action, but an oath taken in vain about the past is merely a verbal pronouncement. <b>Rather, say</b> like this: <b>Just as</b> one <b>is flogged for</b> taking a <b>false</b> oath, i.e., violating one’s oath about the future, <b>so</b> is one <b>also flogged for</b> taking an oath <b>in vain.</b>
The Gemara asks: Why must the <i>baraita</i> state that one is flogged for either type of oath? Isn’t it <b>obvious? This is a prohibition and that is a prohibition,</b> and for both one is liable to receive lashes. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say as Rav Pappa said to Abaye,</b> that the verse: “For the Lord <b>will not absolve of guilt</b> he that takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7), might indicate that God will not absolve him <b>at all,</b> and even if he is punished he cannot atone for his sin,

Daf 21a

it <b>teaches us as</b> Abaye <b>answers him</b> below.
The Gemara offers an alternative resolution of the difficulty posed by the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the assertion of the <i>baraita</i> that the prohibitions against taking an oath in vain and taking a false oath are one means: <b>Just as one brings an offering for</b> taking <b>a false</b> oath, <b>so one brings an offering for</b> taking an oath <b>in vain. And this</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who deems</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring an offering for taking an oath in vain that refers <b>to the past,</b> just <b>as</b> for taking a false oath that refers <b>to the future.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s distinction between a false oath and an oath taken in vain from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which</b> oath <b>is an oath</b> taken <b>in vain?</b> It is when <b>one takes an oath to deny that which is known to people</b> to be true. And <b>a false oath</b> is when one <b>takes an oath</b> that <b>contradicts</b> the past. The Gemara answers: <b>Say,</b> i.e., emend the <i>baraita</i> to say, that a false oath is when one <b>takes an oath and</b> subsequently <b>contradicts</b> it by acting otherwise.
§ <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he reported that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one takes an oath, saying: <b>I ate,</b> or: <b>I did not eat,</b> it is <b>a false</b> oath if it is not true. <b>And its prohibition</b> in the Torah is <b>from:</b> “And <b>you shall not take an oath by My name falsely,</b> so that you profane the name of your God; I am the Lord” (Leviticus 19:12). If one takes an oath, saying: <b>I will eat, or: I will not eat,</b> and breaks his oath, he <b>violates</b> the prohibition: “When a man vows a vow to the Lord, or takes an oath to bind his soul with a bond, <b>he shall not break his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3). <b>And which</b> oath is <b>an oath</b> taken <b>in vain?</b> It is when one <b>takes an oath to deny that which is known to people</b> to be true.
<b>Rav Pappa said: This</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu,</b> i.e., conveying the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>was not stated explicitly</b> by Rabbi Abbahu; <b>rather, it was stated by inference.</b> It was inferred from <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Idi bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rav Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili:</b> With regard to <b>any prohibition in the Torah,</b> if it is a <b>prohibition that involves an action, one is flogged for</b> violating <b>it. But</b> with regard to a prohibition <b>that does not involve an action,</b> one <b>is not flogged</b> for violating it, except in the cases of one who <b>takes an oath, and</b> one who <b>substitutes</b> a different animal for one that is consecrated to be sacrificed (see Leviticus 27:10), <b>and</b> one who curses <b>another using the</b> Divine <b>Name</b> (see Leviticus 19:14).
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that one who <b>takes an oath</b> that is not true is flogged? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: The verse states: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain; for</b> the Lord <b>will not absolve of guilt</b> he that takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7). It is the <b>heavenly court</b> that <b>does not absolve him; but the earthly court flogs him, and</b> in doing so, <b>absolves him of guilt.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Perhaps this</b> is what <b>the Merciful One is saying: He will not be absolved of guilt at all.</b> Abaye answered: <b>If it were written: For he will not be absolved of guilt,</b> it would be <b>as you say. Now that it is written: “For the Lord will not absolve of guilt,”</b> the verse teaches that <b>it is the Lord Who will not absolve</b> one who takes His name in vain; <b>but the earthly court flogs him, and</b> in doing so <b>absolves him of guilt.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>We found</b> a source for receiving lashes for <b>an oath</b> taken <b>in vain,</b> despite the fact that no physical action was performed. <b>From where do we</b> derive that this is also the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a false oath? Rabbi Yoḥanan himself said:</b> The verse states: <b>“In vain…in vain,” twice. If</b> the second mention <b>is not</b> necessary for the <b>matter of an oath</b> taken <b>in vain,</b> since it was already stated, <b>apply it</b> to the <b>matter of a false oath.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Abbahu discusses this:</b> With regard to <b>this false oath</b> referred to by Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>what are the circumstances</b> under which one who takes it is flogged? <b>If we say</b> it is when he says: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> he then <b>ate, that is a prohibition that involves an action. And</b> if one would <b>rather</b> say <b>that he says:</b> On my <b>oath I will eat, and he does not eat, is</b> one who breaks his oath like <b>that flogged? But wasn’t</b> it <b>stated</b> that with regard to one who says: On my <b>oath I will eat this loaf today, and the day passed and he did not eat it, Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish both say he is not flogged?</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says he is not flogged because it is a prohibition that does not involve an action, and</b> concerning <b>any prohibition that does not involve an action, one is not flogged for</b> violating <b>it. And Reish Lakish says he is not flogged because</b> his violation of the prohibition necessarily involves <b>an uncertain forewarning, and an uncertain forewarning is not considered a forewarning</b> at all. Only if one is forewarned immediately prior to violating a prohibition does he receive lashes. Since not fulfilling his oath is a sin of omission, whenever the forewarning is offered, it remains uncertain whether one will fulfill the oath or not.
In response to his own question, <b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> The case where one who takes a false oath is flogged <b>will be where</b> he takes an oath saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about oaths relating to the past, for which one is liable to receive lashes even though he did not perform an action, and oaths relating to the future that one violates by omission, and for which one is therefore exempt from lashes according to Rabbi Yoḥanan because it is a prohibition that does not involve an action? <b>Rava said: The Torah explicitly extended</b> the liability to receive lashes to one who takes <b>a false oath</b> that <b>is similar to an oath</b> taken <b>in vain. Just as</b> an oath taken <b>in vain</b> refers <b>to the past, so too,</b> one is liable for <b>a false</b> oath that refers <b>to the past.</b> This discussion of Rabbi Abbahu’s is the source of his inference as to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan mentioned by Rav Pappa.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> from a mishna (27b): If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat this loaf,</b> and then says: On my <b>oath I will not eat it,</b> and then again: On my <b>oath I will not eat it, and he</b> subsequently <b>ate it, he is liable only once. This is the oath on an utterance for which</b> one who violates the prohibition <b>intentionally is liable</b> to receive <b>lashes and</b> one who violates it <b>unwittingly</b> is liable to bring <b>a sliding-scale offering.</b>
Rabbi Yirmeya asks: When the mishna says: <b>This is</b> the oath on an utterance, it is <b>to exclude what? Is it not to exclude</b> the case of one who takes an oath relating to the past, saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat,</b> thereby indicating <b>that he is not flogged?</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>No.</b> It serves <b>to exclude</b> one who takes an oath saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat, from</b> liability to bring <b>an offering.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>This is</b> the oath on an utterance <b>for which</b> one who violates <b>it unwittingly</b> is liable to bring <b>a sliding-scale offering. But</b> if one takes an oath saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat,</b> then <b>no,</b> one does not bring an offering. <b>And this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says: One is liable</b> to bring an offering <b>only for</b> breaking oaths relating to <b>the future, but one is flogged</b> even for false oaths relating to the past.

Daf 21b

The Gemara asks: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna (29a): Which oath is an oath taken in vain? It is when one takes an oath to deny that which is known to people to be true, like one says with regard to a stone column that it is made of gold. <b>This is an oath</b> taken <b>in vain, for</b> which one is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>lashes</b> if he takes the oath <b>intentionally, and for</b> which he is <b>exempt</b> if he takes it <b>unwittingly.</b> When the mishna says: <b>This is</b> an oath taken in vain, it is <b>to exclude what? What, isn’t</b> that phrase added to the mishna <b>to exclude</b> one who takes an oath saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat,</b> teaching <b>that he is not flogged?</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> the mishna adds: <b>This is</b> an oath, to teach that <b>for</b> violating the prohibition against taking an oath in vain <b>unwittingly,</b> one is <b>exempt from</b> bringing <b>an offering; but</b> one who takes an oath saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat, is liable</b> to bring <b>an offering for an unwitting</b> violation. <b>And this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who deems</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring an offering for oaths referring <b>to the past</b> just <b>like</b> one is liable for oaths referring <b>to the future.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you say</b> that <b>the first clause</b> of that mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael?</b> How can <b>the first clause</b> follow <b>Rabbi Yishmael’s</b> opinion and <b>the latter clause</b> follow <b>Rabbi Akiva’s</b> conflicting opinion? The Gemara answers: The <b>entire</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, and the first clause</b> does <b>not</b> serve <b>to exclude</b> one who took an oath saying: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat, from</b> the liability to bring <b>an offering. Rather,</b> it serves <b>to exclude</b> one who took an oath saying: <b>I will eat, and</b> who subsequently <b>did not eat, from</b> the liability to receive <b>lashes. But he is</b> still <b>liable</b> to bring <b>an offering.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about this way of understanding the mishna that it is to be preferred? The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that when the mishna <b>is addressing</b> an oath referring <b>to the future,</b> it <b>excludes</b> an oath referring <b>to the future,</b> in accordance with the reading that the entire mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. Does it makes sense that when <b>addressing</b> an oath referring <b>to the future,</b> it <b>excludes</b> an oath referring <b>to the past,</b> as the reading of the first clause in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael would have it? Therefore, the added sentence: This is an oath on an utterance, in the first clause, serves to exclude one who took an oath saying: I will eat, and who subsequently did not eat, from the liability to receive lashes; and the whole mishna can be understood as being in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva that one is liable to bring an offering even for oaths relating to the past.
§ The mishna teaches that if one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and he</b> then <b>ate any amount,</b> even less than an olive-bulk, he is <b>liable</b> according to Rabbi Akiva. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Does Rabbi Akiva in the entire Torah,</b> i.e., in general, <b>hold</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who deems</b> one <b>liable</b> for eating <b>any amount</b> of forbidden food? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> One who eats <b>any amount</b> of forbidden food is liable <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes, and</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> the measure of <b>an olive-bulk only in the matter of</b> determining liability to bring <b>an offering.</b>
<b>And</b> if in fact Rabbi Akiva agrees with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, then <b>by right,</b> the mishna <b>should have</b> taught that Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis <b>disagree in general. And</b> the reason <b>that</b> it states only <b>here</b> that <b>they disagree</b> is <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature</b> of the opinion <b>of the Rabbis.</b> The Rabbis hold <b>that even though it is</b> possible <b>to say</b> that <b>since</b> one who eats less than an olive-bulk after taking an oath in which he <b>specifically</b> forbids himself any amount is <b>liable,</b> one who eats less than an olive-bulk <b>without</b> so <b>specifying</b> in his oath will <b>also</b> be <b>liable,</b> as that is included in his oath not to eat, that reasoning is not accepted. The mishna therefore states the dispute in the context of an oath that he will not eat in order to <b>teach us that,</b> according to the Rabbis, as long as he did not specify that his oath includes any amount, he is <b>exempt</b> from receiving lashes.
The Gemara presents the other side of the dilemma: <b>Or perhaps, in general,</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>holds like the Rabbis</b> that one must consume at least an olive-bulk in order to be liable for a prohibition that involves eating. <b>And here,</b> with regard to an oath that one will not eat, <b>this is the reason</b> he disagrees: <b>Since</b> one who <b>specifically</b> forbids himself any amount is <b>liable,</b> one who eats less than an olive-bulk <b>without</b> so <b>specifying</b> in his oath will <b>also</b> be <b>liable.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear that</b> which the Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Akiva: Where do we find that</b> one who <b>eats any amount is liable,</b> leading you to say <b>that this</b> person is <b>liable?</b> The Gemara explains why this is relevant: <b>If it is so</b> that according to Rabbi Akiva one is always liable for eating any amount, <b>let him say to them: In the entire Torah I hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
The Gemara answers: The fact that Rabbi Akiva did not answer the Rabbis in that way does not necessarily indicate that he does not agree with Rabbi Shimon in general. Perhaps he <b>is speaking to the Rabbis in accordance with their</b> own <b>statement,</b> and this is how he would respond to their question: <b>As far as my opinion</b> is concerned, <b>in the entire Torah I hold</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> that one is liable for all prohibitions involving eating when one eats any amount. <b>According to you, admit to me at least</b> that <b>since</b> one who <b>specifically</b> forbids himself any amount is <b>liable,</b> one who eats less than an olive-bulk <b>without</b> so <b>specifying</b> in his oath will <b>also</b> be <b>liable. And the Rabbis said to him: No,</b> we will not admit that.
The Gemara presents another attempt to resolve the dilemma. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 34b): <b>Rabbi Akiva says: A nazirite who soaked his bread in wine</b> and ate it, <b>and</b> the two together <b>contain enough to combine to an olive-bulk,</b> is <b>liable,</b> even though there is less than the minimal measure of wine. <b>And if it should enter your mind that he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon in general,</b> then <b>why do I</b> need the wine and bread <b>to combine</b> to the measure of an olive-bulk? Consumption of any amount of wine should be sufficient for him to be liable.
<b>And additionally, we learned</b> in a mishna (22b): If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then <b>ate</b> the meat of unslaughtered <b>carcasses, or animals with a wound that will cause them to die within twelve months [<i>tereifot</i>],</b> or <b>repugnant creatures, or creeping animals,</b> he is <b>liable; and Rabbi Shimon deems</b> him <b>exempt. And we discussed it: Why</b> is he <b>liable</b> for breaking his oath when he eats non-kosher food? <b>He is</b> already <b>under oath from Mount Sinai</b> not to eat forbidden food, and an oath cannot take effect to render a matter forbidden that is already forbidden. <b>Rav and Shmuel and Rabbi Yoḥanan both,</b> i.e., all, <b>say</b> that this is a case <b>where he incorporates</b> into the oath that he will not eat some <b>permitted items, along with</b> the statement concerning the <b>forbidden items.</b> Since the oath takes effect with regard to the permitted items, it extends also to the forbidden ones.
<b>And Reish Lakish says: You find</b> that one is liable for eating forbidden food as the result of an oath <b>only if</b> it is both an oath <b>where</b> he <b>specifies</b> that it includes <b>a half-measure,</b> in this case, less than an olive-bulk, <b>and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> that one is not liable for eating a half-measure unless it is specified in the oath. Since eating a half-measure is not prohibited by the Torah, the oath takes effect. Alternatively, you find that one is liable <b>if</b> he took the oath <b>without specifying</b> that the oath prohibits less than the usual measure <b>and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>a person renders himself prohibited from</b> eating <b>any amount</b> by taking an oath not to eat.
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that Rabbi Akiva <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon in general,</b> this is difficult, as one who consumes <b>any amount is also already under oath from Mount Sinai.</b> Why should the oath take effect according to Reish Lakish? <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it: In general, Rabbi Akiva holds like the Rabbis,</b> and it is only with regard to unspecified oaths that he deems one liable for eating any amount? The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Akiva holds like the Rabbis.
§ The mishna teaches: The Rabbis <b>said to Rabbi Akiva: Where do we find</b> that one who eats any amount is liable, leading you to say that this person is liable? The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> do we <b>not? But isn’t</b> one who eats <b>an ant</b> liable, despite the fact that it is smaller than an olive-bulk? The Gemara answers: A whole <b>entity is different,</b> since it has significance.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> one who eats less than an olive-bulk of <b>consecrated</b> food liable? The Gemara answers: In order to be liable for eating consecrated food, <b>we require</b> a different measure, an amount <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b> One is not liable for eating an amount worth less than that.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> one who <b>specifies</b> in his oath that he is prohibited from eating any amount liable for doing so? The Gemara answers: One who <b>specifies</b> that eating any amount is prohibited is <b>indeed comparable to</b> one who eats a whole <b>entity,</b> since he has granted it significance.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> there an unresolved question with regard to one who took an oath not to eat and then ate <b>dirt?</b> If, as the Rabbis claim, one is not liable for eating less than a full measure, you could <b>rather</b>

Daf 22a

<b>answer that</b> which <b>Rava asks</b> with regard to one who says: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> who then <b>ate dirt.</b> Rava’s question is: <b>How much</b> must he eat <b>in</b> order to be liable? Based on the Rabbis’ statement, <b>you could answer</b> that he is not liable <b>unless there is an olive-bulk</b> that he has eaten. The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <b>When we say</b> in the mishna that there are no cases where a person who eats less than a full measure is liable, <b>we say</b> it <b>with regard to items that are edible.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t <i>konamot</i></b> an example of a case where one is liable for eating even less than an olive-bulk? The Gemara answers: <b><i>Konamot</i> are also like</b> a case where he <b>specifies</b> that any amount is forbidden for consumption.
§ The mishna teaches that Rabbi Akiva <b>said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>Where do we find one who speaks and</b> is liable to <b>bring an offering</b> for it, <b>as this</b> oath taker merely <b>speaks,</b> i.e., takes an oath, <b>and brings an offering</b> for it? The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> do we <b>not? But isn’t a blasphemer</b> liable to bring an offering according to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva (see <i>Karetot</i> 7a)? The Gemara answers: <b>We are speaking of one who speaks and</b> in doing so <b>generates a prohibition. And this one,</b> the blasphemer, <b>is</b> merely one who <b>speaks and sins</b> but does not bring an offering.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But doesn’t a nazirite</b> render wine forbidden to himself through speech, by making a vow? And he does bring an offering. The Gemara answers: <b>We are speaking of one who brings an offering</b> specifically <b>for his speaking, and this one,</b> the nazirite, <b>brings an offering</b> at the end of his naziriteship <b>in order to permit wine to himself.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t consecrated</b> property a case where one renders an item forbidden via speech alone and brings an offering for its misuse? The Gemara answers: <b>We are speaking of one who,</b> by speaking, <b>generates a prohibition for himself,</b> and nevertheless brings an offering. <b>And this one,</b> who consecrates an item, <b>generates a prohibition for the whole world.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>Aren’t <i>konamot</i></b> an example of a case where one renders an item forbidden to himself by speech alone and brings an offering for using it? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Akiva <b>holds</b> that <b>there is no</b> prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>with regard to <i>konamot</i>.</b>
§ <b>Rava says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis is with regard to <b>where</b> one took the oath <b>without specifying</b> that he is liable for eating any amount. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where he specifies</b> that his oath applies to any amount, <b>everyone agrees</b> that he is liable <b>for</b> eating <b>any amount. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>One who specifies</b> this renders any amount significant <b>like</b> a whole <b>entity.</b>
<b>And Rava says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> is with regard to a case <b>where</b> one takes an oath saying: On my oath <b>I will not eat, but</b> in a case <b>where</b> one says: On my oath <b>I will not taste, all agree</b> that he is liable <b>for</b> tasting <b>any amount.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that he is liable in that case? Tasting has no defined measure. The Gemara answers: Rava nevertheless taught it, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>even</b> if one takes an oath saying: I will not taste, he is liable only if he eats an olive-bulk, <b>as people say: To taste,</b> as a way of saying: To eat. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.
§ <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> in the mishna is <b>with regard to oaths, but with regard to <i>konamot</i>, all agree</b> that one is liable for eating <b>any amount. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Indeed,</b> with regard to <b><i>konamot</i>, since</b> in the vow <b>he did not explicitly mention eating,</b> which has a defined measure, but only that the item is forbidden to him like an offering, it is <b>as if he specified</b> that he is liable for eating any amount.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: Items that are forbidden by <b>two <i>konamot</i> combine</b> to produce a full measure for which one is liable; items forbidden by <b>two oaths do not</b> so <b>combine. Rabbi Meir says:</b> Items forbidden by <b><i>konamot</i> are like</b> those forbidden by <b>oaths.</b> The Gemara explains the objection: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that with regard to items forbidden by <i>konamot</i>, one is <b>liable for</b> eating <b>any amount, why do I</b> need them <b>to combine?</b>
The Gemara answers: They combine in a case <b>where he said: Eating from this one is <i>konam</i> for me; eating from that one is <i>konam</i> for me.</b> Since he explicitly mentions eating, he is not liable unless he eats an olive-bulk. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why do they combine to</b> produce a full measure? <b>Ultimately,</b> since he took two separate vows, <b>go to this</b> item and <b>there is not</b> a full <b>measure, and go to that</b> item and <b>there is not</b> a full <b>measure.</b> The Gemara answers: They combined to produce one full measure <b>when he said: Eating from both of them is <i>konam</i> for me.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>In the corresponding</b> situation <b>with regard to oaths, where he said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat from both of them, why do they not combine? Rav Pineḥas said: Oaths are different. Since</b> two items that are forbidden by a single oath <b>are distinct with regard to sin-offerings,</b> in that one is liable to bring a sin-offering for eating each one, so too eating a small amount from each <b>does not combine</b> in order to produce a full measure.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> how did <b>Rabbi Meir say</b> that items forbidden by <b><i>konamot</i> are like</b> those forbidden by <b>oaths</b> and do not combine to produce a full measure? <b>Granted that</b> items forbidden by <b>oaths</b> do not combine, <b>since they are distinct with regard to sin-offerings, but why do</b> items forbidden by <b><i>konamot</i> not</b> combine? The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the language so that the <i>baraita</i> has <b>Rabbi Meir say:</b> Items forbidden by <b>oaths are like</b> items forbidden by <b><i>konamot</i>.</b> Neither combines to produce a full measure, <b>and</b> Rabbi Meir <b>does not accept</b> the statement <b>of Rav Pineḥas</b> that items forbidden by oaths are different.
<b>Ravina said: When Rav Pappa says</b> that one is liable for eating any amount of an item forbidden by <i>konamot</i>, that is <b>with regard to the matter of lashes. When it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that items forbidden by <i>konamot</i> combine to produce a full measure, <b>that</b> is <b>with regard to the matter of an offering</b> for misuse of consecrated property, <b>where we require</b> that one derive benefit equal to the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i></b> from the forbidden item.
The Gemara asks: Is that <b>to say that the Sages hold</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property extend <b>to</b> items forbidden by <b><i>konamot</i>? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one said: <b>This loaf is consecrated, and</b> subsequently <b>ate it,</b> then <b>either he or another</b> who ate it is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property; <b>consequently,</b> since the loaf is consecrated, <b>it is subject to redemption.</b> If one said: <b>This loaf is</b> forbidden <b>to me</b> as if it were <b>consecrated,</b> i.e., it is <i>konam</i> for me, and then he ate it, <b>he</b> is liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property, but <b>another</b> is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property; <b>consequently,</b> since the loaf is not fully consecrated, <b>it is not subject to redemption.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>

Daf 22b

<b>And the Rabbis say: Both he and the other</b> are <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property, <b>because there is no</b> prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>with regard to <i>konamot</i>.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>Reverse</b> the opinions and say as follows: <b>Both this one and that one</b> are <b>not</b> liable for <b>misusing</b> consecrated property, <b>because there is no</b> prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>with regard to <i>konamot</i>.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: He</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>and the other</b> is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> how is it that <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> in the previous <i>baraita</i>: Items forbidden by <b><i>konamot</i> are like</b> those forbidden by <b>oaths?</b> Items forbidden by <b><i>konamot</i> do not combine</b> to produce a full measure that renders one liable for misuse of consecrated property, <b>but</b> this indicates that <b>misuse of consecrated property</b> nevertheless <b>applies to them. But doesn’t Rabbi Meir say,</b> according to the reversal of the opinions, that <b>with regard to <i>konamot</i>, there is no</b> prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>at all?</b>
The Gemara answers: When Rabbi Meir says that items forbidden by <i>konamot</i> do not combine to produce a full measure, <b>he is saying</b> this <b>to the Rabbis in accordance with their statement,</b> as follows: <b>According to my</b> opinion <b>with regard to <i>konamot</i>, there is no</b> prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>at all. According to your</b> opinion, <b>at least admit to me that</b> items forbidden by <b><i>konamot</i> are like</b> items forbidden by <b>oaths</b> and do not combine to produce a full measure.
<b>And the Rabbis?</b> They explain that with regard to items forbidden by <b>oaths</b> one should <b>apply</b> the reasoning <b>of Rav Pineḥas</b> that since two items that are forbidden by a single oath are distinct with regard to sin-offerings, they do not combine in order to produce a full measure. With regard to <b><i>konamot</i></b> the reasoning <b>of Rav Pineḥas does not apply.</b>
§ <b>Rava says</b> that if one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then he <b>ate dirt,</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> because eating dirt is not considered to be eating. <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat dirt, how much</b> dirt must he eat <b>in</b> order to be liable? Is the <i>halakha</i> that <b>since he said: I will not eat</b> dirt, <b>his intention is</b> that the prohibition applies <b>to an olive-bulk?</b> That is the standard measure for prohibitions with regard to eating. <b>Or perhaps, since</b> dirt <b>is not something that people eat,</b> he is liable <b>for</b> eating <b>any amount.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat a grape seed, how much</b> must he eat <b>in</b> order to be liable? Is the <i>halakha</i> that <b>since it is</b> ordinarily <b>eaten in a mixture,</b> i.e., as part of a grape, <b>his intention is</b> that the prohibition applies <b>to</b> a complete <b>olive-bulk</b> measure of grape seeds? <b>Or perhaps, since people do not eat it by itself</b> but always in a mixture, <b>his intention is</b> to be liable <b>for</b> eating <b>any amount.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> In the case of <b>a nazirite who says:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat a grape seed, how much</b> must he eat <b>in</b> order to be liable? A nazirite is prohibited from eating grape seeds (see Numbers 6:4). Is the <i>halakha</i> <b>that since</b> eating <b>an olive-bulk is a prohibition by Torah law, when he takes an oath</b> of this sort, <b>he is taking the oath to</b> prohibit <b>that which is permitted</b> to him <b>and his intention</b> in taking the oath is <b>to</b> prohibit eating <b>any amount? Or perhaps, since he said: I will not eat</b> a grape seed, <b>his intention</b> is that the prohibition applies <b>to an olive-bulk,</b> which is the standard measure for what is considered eating.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a mishna (22b): With regard to one who said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then <b>ate</b> the meat of unslaughtered <b>carcasses or <i>tereifot</i>, repugnant creatures or creeping animals,</b> he is <b>liable. And Rabbi Shimon deems</b> him <b>exempt. And we discussed it: Why</b> is he <b>liable</b> for violating his oath when he eats non-kosher food? <b>He is already under oath from Mount Sinai</b> not to eat forbidden food, and an oath cannot take effect to prohibit that which is already forbidden. <b>Rav and Shmuel and Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> all <b>say</b> that this is a case <b>where he incorporates</b> into the oath that he will not eat some <b>permitted items, along with</b> the statement concerning the <b>forbidden items.</b> Since the oath takes effect with regard to the permitted items, it extends also to the forbidden ones.
<b>And Reish Lakish says: You find</b> that one is liable for eating non-kosher food after taking an oath not to eat <b>only if</b> it is both a case <b>where</b> he <b>specifies</b> in the oath that his oath includes <b>a half-measure and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> that one is not liable for eating a half-measure unless it is specified in the oath. Since eating a half-measure is not prohibited by the Torah, the oath takes effect. Alternatively, you find that one is liable <b>if</b> he took the oath <b>without specifying</b> that the oath prohibits less than the usual measure <b>and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>a person renders himself prohibited from</b> eating <b>any amount</b> by taking an oath not to eat.
The Gemara comments: <b>But isn’t a carcass</b> an item for <b>which one is already under oath from Mount Sinai?</b> In that respect it <b>resembles a grape seed for a nazirite, and</b> yet <b>the reason</b> that Reish Lakish says he is liable according to the Rabbis is <b>that he specified</b> that the oath prohibits him from eating even a half-measure, indicating <b>that</b> if he <b>did not specify, his intention</b> is that the oath refer <b>to an olive-bulk. Conclude from it</b> that a nazirite who takes an oath not to eat a grape seed is liable only if he eats an olive-bulk.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this, <b>resolve</b> the dilemma <b>that Rava raises</b> with regard to one who says: On my <b>oath I will not eat dirt,</b> asking <b>how much</b> he must eat <b>in</b> order to be liable? <b>Resolve</b> the dilemma by saying that he is not liable <b>unless</b> he eats <b>an olive-bulk, since a carcass resembles dirt, and the reason</b> he is liable is <b>that he specified</b> that the oath prohibits him from eating even a half-measure, indicating <b>that</b> if he <b>did not specify, his intention is</b> that the oath refers <b>to an olive-bulk.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the dilemma cannot be resolved based on this comparison. <b>Dirt is entirely inedible. A carcass,</b> by contrast, <b>is edible, but a lion crouches on it,</b> i.e., eating it is prohibited by the Torah. Therefore, one cannot derive the <i>halakha</i> concerning dirt from the <i>halakha</i> concerning a carcass.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then he <b>ate and drank, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering, because an oath to refrain from eating includes refraining from drinking. If he said: On my <b>oath I will not eat and I will not drink, and</b> then he <b>ate and drank,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> offerings. If he said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then he <b>ate wheat bread and barley bread and spelt bread, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering. If he said: On my <b>oath I will not eat wheat bread or barley bread or spelt bread, and</b> then he <b>ate</b> all of them, he is <b>liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for each and every one.</b> If he said: On my <b>oath I will not drink, and</b> then he <b>drank several</b> kinds of <b>liquids, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering. If he said: On my <b>oath I will not drink wine or oil or honey, and</b> then <b>he drank</b> all of them, he is <b>liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for each and every one.</b>
If he said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and he ate foods that are inedible or drank liquids that are not potable,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> If he said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then he <b>ate</b> the meat of unslaughtered <b>carcasses or <i>tereifot</i>, repugnant creatures or creeping animals,</b> he is <b>liable. And Rabbi Shimon deems</b> him <b>exempt,</b> since he is already under oath from Mount Sinai not to eat them and an oath cannot take effect where another oath is in force. But if he <b>said:</b> It is <b><i>konam</i></b> for <b>my wife to derive benefit from me if I ate today, and he had eaten carcasses or <i>tereifot</i>, repugnant creatures or creeping animals, his wife is prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from him.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then <b>he drank,</b> he is <b>liable. If you wish,</b> you may <b>propose a logical argument</b> for this ruling, <b>and if you wish,</b> you may <b>cite a verse</b> to explain it.
The Gemara explains: <b>If you wish,</b> you may <b>propose a logical argument</b> for this ruling: It is clear that drinking is included in eating from the fact <b>that a person will say to another: Let’s</b> have <b>a taste</b> of <b>something, and they go in and eat and drink. And if you wish, cite a verse</b> as the source for this ruling, <b>as Reish Lakish says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that drinking is included in eating? It is</b> derived <b>from that</b> which <b>is stated: “And you shall eat before the Lord your God, in the place that He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, the tithe of your grain, of your <i>tirosh</i>,</b> and of your oil” (Deuteronomy 14:23).

Daf 23a

<b>And</b> since the Hebrew word <b><i>tirosh</i></b> mentioned in the verse <b>is wine, and it is written</b> with regard to it: <b>“And you shall eat,”</b> this indicates that drinking is an activity included in eating.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> the verse is referring to consuming wine <b>by means of an <i>anigeron</i>, as Rabba bar Shmuel says: <i>Anigeron</i></b> is <b>a stew of beet greens</b> and wine, and <b><i>aksigeron</i></b> is a <b>stew of all types of cooked</b> vegetables. If so, the wine in the verse is not drunk but eaten.
<b>Rather, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> Cite <b>from here,</b> a verse written with regard to money with which one has redeemed second tithe: <b>“And you shall bestow the money for whatsoever your soul desires, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine [<i>uvayyayin</i>], or for strong drink,</b> or for whatsoever your soul asks of you; and you shall eat there before the Lord your God, and you shall rejoice, you and your household” (Deuteronomy 14:26). The Hebrew word <b><i>yayin</i></b> mentioned in the verse <b>is wine, and it is written: “And you shall eat.”</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps here</b> this verse is <b>also</b> referring to consuming wine <b>by means of an <i>anigeron</i>.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>“Strong drink” is written</b> in the verse, referring to <b>something intoxicating,</b> and wine mixed into a stew is not intoxicating.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> the intoxicating substance referred to in the verse is pressed <b>figs from Ke’ila, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A priest who <b>ate</b> pressed <b>figs from Ke’ila or drank honey or milk and</b> then <b>entered the Temple and performed</b> the sacrificial rites is <b>liable</b> for violating the prohibition against conducting the Temple service while intoxicated.
<b>Rather,</b> one <b>derives</b> the meaning of <b>“strong drink”</b> in this verse by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the verse about <b>a nazirite:</b> “He shall abstain from wine and <b>strong drink:</b> He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried” (Numbers 6:3). <b>Just as there,</b> the strong drink that is forbidden to the nazirite is referring to a type of <b>wine, so too here,</b> the verse is referring to <b>wine.</b>
§ <b>Rava said: We learn</b> in the mishna <b>as well</b> that drinking is included in eating. The mishna teaches: If one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then he <b>ate and drank, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>drinking is included in eating,</b> that is why <b>it was necessary for the <i>tanna</i> to teach us that he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>drinking is not included in eating,</b> there is no reason for the <i>tanna</i> to teach that it is only one violation. If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and he ate and performed</b> some kind of <b>labor, would it be necessary to teach us that</b> the person is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering? He never took an oath prohibiting labor.
<b>Abaye said to him: What, rather,</b> is your conclusion; that <b>drinking is included in eating? Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If he said: On my <b>oath I will not eat and I will not drink, and</b> then he <b>ate and drank,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> offerings. According to you, Rava, <b>once he said: I will not eat, drinking became forbidden to him,</b> so <b>when he said: I will not drink, why</b> is he rendered <b>liable</b> to bring a separate offering? <b>If he had said: I will not drink, two times, would he be liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> offerings?
Rava <b>said to him: There,</b> in the mishna, it is actually a case <b>where he said: I will not drink, and then said: I will not eat.</b> Although <b>it is</b> so <b>that drinking is included in eating, it is not</b> so that <b>eating is included in drinking,</b> and the oath not to drink went into effect independently of the oath not to eat. Therefore, he is liable to bring two offerings.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this, if <b>he said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat and I will not drink, and he</b> then <b>ate and drank, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it that <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering? <b>If that is so, rather than teaching</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna that one who said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then <b>ate and drank, is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> the following: If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat and I will not drink,</b> and he ate and drank, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering. From that ruling it could be concluded that when one takes an oath: <b>I will not eat, alone, all the more so</b> is he liable to bring only one offering.
<b>Rather,</b> the mishna <b>actually</b> is <b>as it is taught,</b> that one who took an oath not to eat and drink, and then ate and drank, is liable to bring two offerings, even though drinking is included in eating. <b>And here</b> it <b>is different. Since he said: I will not eat, and then said: I will not drink, he revealed his intention that the eating that he stated</b> first <b>is eating alone</b> and does not include drinking.
<b>Rav Ashi said: The mishna is also precisely</b> formulated in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel that drinking is included in eating. It teaches: If he said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and he ate foods that are inedible or drank liquids that are not potable,</b> he is <b>exempt. But</b> if those liquids were <b>fit</b> for consumption, he would be <b>liable. And why?</b> The mishna teaches that he took an oath <b>saying:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat,</b> without mentioning drinking, which indicates that drinking is included in eating.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he said both:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat</b> and: On my <b>oath I will not drink.</b> The mishna did not spell out the second oath because its primary interest was in teaching that eating or drinking that which is inedible or not potable is not considered eating or drinking.
§ The mishna teaches that if one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then he <b>ate wheat bread</b> and barley bread and spelt bread, he is liable to bring only one offering. If he said: On my oath I will not eat wheat bread or barley bread or spelt bread, and then he ate all of them, he is liable to bring an offering for each one. The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> when he details each type of bread it <b>comes to</b> ensure that he <b>exempts himself from</b> having <b>other</b> foods included in the oath, not to indicate that each type of bread is a separate oath.
The Gemara answers: If that was his intention, then <b>he could have</b> just <b>said: Wheat, barley, and spelt,</b> without mentioning bread each time. From the fact that he mentioned bread each time, it can be understood that his intention was that each be considered a separate oath. The Gemara rejects this: <b>But</b> if he did not mention bread, <b>perhaps</b> his oath could be interpreted <b>to</b> prohibit <b>chewing [<i>lakhos</i>]</b> whole kernels of these grains, and he consequently mentioned bread to limit the oath to bread.
The Gemara suggests: If his intention was to ensure that his oath does not extend to other foods, <b>he could have</b> just <b>said: Bread</b> made from <b>wheat, or barley, or spelt,</b> and in that way his oath would be limited to just bread. The Gemara rejects this: If he had said it that way, <b>perhaps</b> his oath could be interpreted to prohibit him from <b>eating wheat bread</b> and from <b>chewing</b> whole kernels of <b>barley or spelt.</b>
The Gemara suggests: If his intention was to ensure that his oath does not extend to other foods, <b>he could have</b> just <b>said: Bread</b> made from <b>wheat, and from barley, and from spelt,</b> thereby limiting his oath to types of bread.

Daf 23b

The Gemara rejects this: <b>But</b> if he had said it that way, <b>perhaps</b> his oath could be interpreted to prohibit only bread made <b>from a mixture</b> of all these grains.
The Gemara suggests: If the specification in the mishna serves merely to ensure that his oath does not extend to other foods, have him <b>say:</b> Bread made from wheat <b>and so from barley and so from spelt. Why do I</b> need to repeat: <b>Bread, bread,</b> each time? <b>Conclude from it</b> that the point of repeating the word bread each time is <b>to individuate</b> each statement as a separate oath.
§ The mishna teaches: If he said: On my <b>oath I will not drink, and</b> then <b>he drank several</b> kinds of <b>liquids, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> offering. If he says: On my oath I will not drink wine, or oil, or honey, and he drank all of them, he is liable to bring an offering for each and every one. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, there,</b> in the case of the bread, the ruling of the mishna is understood, <b>as you said</b> that the word <b>bread</b> before barley, and the word <b>bread</b> before spelt <b>are superfluous</b> and serve <b>to</b> extend his <b>liability</b> so that each is considered an independent oath. <b>But here,</b> where there is no superfluous language, <b>what was there to say? Perhaps</b> the oath <b>comes to</b> ensure that he <b>exempts himself</b> so that the oath does not extend <b>to other liquids.</b> Since that is a possibility, he should not be liable for breaking three separate oaths when he drank all three liquids.
<b>Rav Pappa said: We are dealing here with</b> a situation where all three liquids are <b>placed before him.</b> Under the circumstances, if he merely wished to indicate that his oath is limited to these liquids, <b>he could have said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not drink these.</b> Since he instead specified the liquids in the oath, it was in order to indicate that each should be considered as a separate oath. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> had he said: I will not drink these, <b>perhaps</b> his oath would be interpreted as meaning: <b>It is these</b> liquids, which are before me right now, <b>that I will not drink,</b> but <b>I will drink other</b> wine, oil, and honey.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> if he merely wished to indicate that his oath is limited to these types of liquids, it would be a case <b>where he said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not drink</b> liquids <b>such as these.</b> The Gemara challenges: Had he said it that way, <b>perhaps</b> it could be interpreted as referring to the volume of the liquids: <b>I will not drink</b> liquids <b>such as these,</b> but <b>I will drink less than this or more than this.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> if he merely wished to indicate that his oath is limited to these types of liquids, it is a case <b>where he said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not drink from these types</b> of liquids. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> had he said it that way, <b>perhaps</b> his oath would be interpreted to mean: <b>I will not drink these types</b> of liquids in general, <b>but I will drink these particular</b> liquids in front of me.
The Gemara suggests: If the point of the specification of the liquids in the mishna was merely to ensure that his oath does not extend to other liquids, have him <b>say:</b> On my oath <b>I will not drink these and</b> liquids of <b>their types.</b> Since he instead specified: Wine, oil, and honey, one may conclude that his intention was to individuate each liquid as a separate oath.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: We are dealing with</b> a case in <b>which another is importuning him</b> to drink, <b>as</b> he <b>said to him: Come, drink wine, and oil, and honey with me;</b> if he wanted him to desist, <b>he should have said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not drink with you.</b> Under these circumstances, <b>why do I</b> need him to specify: <b>Wine, and oil, and honey?</b> The specification of the liquids serves to indicate his intention <b>to render</b> himself <b>liable for each and every one.</b>
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (36b) with regard to an oath concerning a deposit, that if one says to his bailee: <b>Give me my wheat, barley, and spelt</b> that are <b>in your possession,</b> and the bailee lies and says: On my <b>oath nothing of yours is in my possession, he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> guilt-offering. But if the bailee says: On my <b>oath I do not have in my possession</b> any <b>wheat, barley, or spelt that belong to you,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring a separate offering <b>for each and every one.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> with regard to that mishna that he is liable <b>even</b> if the value <b>of all</b> three species <b>combines</b> to amount to as little as one <b><i>peruta</i>.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree with regard to this. One said:</b> When the bailee says: On my oath I do not have in my possession any wheat, barley, or spelt that belong to you, <b>he is liable</b> to bring a guilt-offering only <b>for</b> violating the <b>specific</b> oaths for individual types of grain, and <b>he is not liable for</b> violating a general oath that he does not have anything in his possession. Consequently, Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that the different types of grains can be combined to amount to one <i>peruta</i> is referring only to the oath in the first clause of the mishna where he did not specify the grains. <b>And one said: He is also liable for</b> violating a general oath, and in the latter clause of the mishna he is liable for violating four oaths: One general oath that he does not have anything in his possession and three specific oaths, one for each type of grain. Consequently, Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement applies also to where he specifies the grains, and he is liable to bring one offering even when all three species combine to amount to only one <i>peruta</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>Here,</b> in the case of one who takes an oath that he will not eat wheat bread, barley bread, or spelt bread, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is there a dispute as to whether he is considered to have taken a general oath alongside the specific oaths?
<b>Rava said: How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of an oath of a deposit, he is <b>liable for</b> the <b>general</b> oath <b>and for</b> the <b>specific</b> oath, <b>since if</b> a bailee <b>takes an oath</b> denying that he is in possession of a deposit <b>and then takes another oath</b> to the same effect, he is <b>liable</b> for taking <b>two</b> false oaths on a deposit. <b>Here,</b> with regard to an oath to prohibit oneself from eating, <b>if it enters your mind</b> that <b>he is bound by a general</b> oath, <b>why would he be liable for the specific</b> oaths? <b>He is already under an oath</b> due to the general oath, and an oath cannot take effect when the matter it prohibits is already forbidden by another oath.
§ The mishna teaches that if one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat,</b> and he ate foods that are inedible, he is exempt. If he said: On my oath I will not eat, and then he ate the meat of unslaughtered carcasses, he is liable. The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> mishna <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult. You said</b> that if one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and he ate foods that are inedible, or drank liquids that are not potable,</b> he is <b>exempt. And then</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that if one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> then he <b>ate</b> the meat of <b>unslaughtered carcasses or <i>tereifot</i>, repugnant creatures or creeping animals,</b> he is <b>liable. What is different</b> about <b>the first clause that</b> he is <b>exempt and what is different</b> about <b>the latter clause that</b> he is <b>liable?</b> Non-kosher animals are also unfit to be eaten.
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult. The first clause</b> is <b>where</b> he took an oath not to eat <b>without specifying</b> what is included in it. Presumably, his oath did not include items that are not ordinarily eaten. <b>And the latter clause</b> is a case <b>where he specifies</b> what it is he will not eat, e.g., unslaughtered carcasses, and nevertheless eats them.
The Gemara asks: <b>You may also raise a difficulty</b> with regard to the case where he <b>specifies</b> that he will not eat non-kosher items: <b>Why? He is under oath from Mount Sinai,</b> and an oath does not take effect to prohibit that which is already forbidden.
<b>Rav and Shmuel and Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> all <b>say</b> that this is a case <b>where he incorporates</b> into the oath that he will not eat some <b>permitted items, along with</b> the statement concerning the <b>forbidden items.</b> Since the oath takes effect with regard to the permitted items, it extends also to the forbidden ones.
<b>And Reish Lakish says: You find</b> that one is liable for eating non-kosher food as the result of an oath <b>only if</b> it is an oath <b>where</b> he <b>specifies</b> that it includes <b>a half-measure, and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> that one is not liable for eating a half-measure unless it is specified in the oath. Since eating a half-measure is not prohibited by Torah law, the oath takes effect. Alternatively, you find that one is liable <b>if</b> he took the oath <b>without specifying</b> that the oath prohibits less than the usual measure, and <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>a person renders himself prohibited from</b> eating <b>any amount</b> by taking an oath not to eat.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> it is understood why <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan did not say like Reish Lakish, as he interprets the mishna</b> so that it is <b>in accordance with the opinion of everyone; but what is the reason that Reish Lakish does not say like</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b>
The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish could <b>say to you: When we say</b> that a more <b>inclusive prohibition,</b> which adds additional aspects to the prohibition for the same individual, can take effect where there already is a prohibition in place,

Daf 24a

it is <b>with regard to a prohibition that occurs on its own,</b> like the prohibition against eating on Yom Kippur, which is more inclusive than the prohibition against eating non-kosher food and therefore takes effect. But <b>with regard to a prohibition that occurs by</b> the act of a person <b>himself,</b> i.e., an oath or a vow, <b>we do not say</b> that because it is more inclusive it can take effect also with regard to items that are already forbidden by Torah law.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Reish Lakish,</b> who understands the mishna to be dealing with the case of one who took an oath about less than a full measure, it is <b>due to this</b> reason that <b>Rabbi Shimon deems exempt</b> one who takes an oath prohibiting himself from eating non-kosher food, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Any amount</b> is sufficient <b>to</b> render one liable to receive <b>lashes, and</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> the measure of <b>an olive-bulk</b> to determine <b>only</b> liability <b>to</b> bring <b>an offering.</b> According to Reish Lakish, Rabbi Shimon holds that one is already under oath from Mount Sinai even with regard to less than a full measure, and for that reason the oath does not take effect. <b>But according to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who understands the mishna to be referring to an oath that includes erstwhile permitted items, <b>what is the reason that Rabbi Shimon deems one exempt</b> from bringing an offering for breaking his oath not to eat non-kosher food?
The Gemara answers: <b>Isn’t the reason</b> that the first <i>tanna</i> holds that the individual is liable for violating his oath <b>only</b> due to the fact <b>that</b> the oath generates <b>a more inclusive prohibition?</b> In this matter <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning</b> in <b>that he does not hold</b> that a more <b>inclusive prohibition</b> takes effect where a preexisting prohibition is in place. This is in accordance with <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: One who eats non-kosher meat on Yom Kippur</b> is <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering for eating on Yom Kippur, despite the fact that the prohibition against eating on Yom Kippur is a more inclusive prohibition than that of eating non-kosher meat, as on that day one may not eat anything.
From the verse: “Or if any one take an oath clearly with his lips to do evil, or to do good” (Leviticus 5:4), the Sages derived that one is liable to bring an offering for an oath on an utterance only when the oath is such that it could be inverted from the positive to the negative or vice versa. For example, one is liable for violating an oath to eat because one can also take an oath not to eat. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish, you find</b> a case <b>where</b> the oath can be <b>negative or positive.</b> Therefore, one is liable according to the Rabbis when he takes an oath that he will eat any amount, since he could also take an oath that he will not eat any amount. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan, granted,</b> that <b>you can find</b> a case of <b>a negative</b> oath, as the oath not to eat non-kosher animals takes effect when it includes other erstwhile permitted items. <b>But how can you find a positive</b> version of this oath? An oath to eat non-kosher animals cannot take effect, as eating non-kosher animals is prohibited by Torah law.
<b>Rather,</b> do not distinguish between the former and the latter clauses of the mishna based on whether he specifies what he is eating. In both cases he takes an oath not to eat, without specifying. In the case where he eats something inedible, he is exempt, <b>in accordance with that which Rava</b> says, <b>as Rava says</b> that if one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat, and</b> he <b>ate dirt,</b> he <b>is exempt,</b> since eating an inedible substance is not considered to be eating. Eating non-kosher meat is considered to be eating; for that reason, the latter clause of the mishna states that one is liable for doing so if he took an oath not to eat. The oath takes effect with regard to the non-kosher items because, as Rabbi Yoḥanan noted, it includes items that would otherwise be permitted.
<b>Rav Mari said: We learn</b> in the mishna (22b) <b>as well</b> that eating non-kosher food is considered eating, as if one said: It is <b><i>konam</i></b> for <b>my wife to derive benefit from me if I ate today, and he had eaten carcasses or <i>tereifot</i>, repugnant creatures or creeping animals, his wife is prohibited</b> from deriving benefit from <b>him.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, since he initially ate</b> the forbidden item <b>and</b> only <b>then took an oath</b> saying that he did not eat,

Daf 24b

in taking the oath, <b>he granted significance to</b> the non-kosher food, and that is why his eating forbidden items is considered to be eating. <b>But here,</b> where he took an oath not to eat and then ate non-kosher food, <b>did he</b> thereby <b>give significance to it?</b> For this reason, no conclusive proof can be cited from the last case in the mishna.
Rabbi Yoḥanan understands the mishna as referring to a case in which the oath takes effect because it is a more inclusive prohibition than the prohibition against eating non-kosher food, in that it adds additional prohibitions for the same individual. In this context, <b>Rava says: What is the reasoning of the one who holds</b> that a more <b>inclusive prohibition</b> takes effect where there already is a prohibition in place?
Rava answers his own question: <b>It is just as it is</b> in the case <b>of an expanded prohibition,</b> which incorporates additional people into the list of those for whom the original item is forbidden. An expanded prohibition also takes effect despite the fact that there is already a prohibition in place.
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>the one who exempts</b> another from liability in the case of a more inclusive prohibition, <b>as he does not hold</b> that it takes effect, why does he hold that an expanded prohibition does take effect? <b>When he says</b> that <b>an expanded prohibition</b> takes effect, that is <b>with regard to a single piece,</b> i.e., that the number of people who are prohibited from eating the same piece of meat is expanded. <b>With regard to two</b> distinct <b>pieces,</b> i.e., a case where the new prohibition expands the scope of prohibited items, as in an inclusive prohibition, <b>we do not say</b> that it takes effect.
§ <b>And Rava says: According to the one who holds</b> that a more <b>inclusive prohibition</b> takes effect where another prohibition is already in place, the <i>halakha</i> should be as follows: When a person <b>says:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat figs, and then says:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat figs and grapes, since</b> the last oath <b>takes effect with regard to the grapes, it also takes effect with regard to the figs,</b> even though they were already forbidden by his previous oath.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we say</b> that a more inclusive prohibition takes effect only with regard to <b>a prohibition that occurs on its own,</b> like the prohibition against eating non-kosher food, but with regard to <b>a prohibition that occurs by</b> the act of a person <b>himself we do not say</b> that the more inclusive prohibition takes effect, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that there is no difference.
<b>Rava, son of Rabba, raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Karetot</i> 13b): <b>It is</b> possible for a person to <b>perform one</b> act of <b>eating for which</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>four sin-offerings and one guilt-offering. And these are</b> the prohibitions one can violate in this manner: <b>A ritually impure</b> person <b>who ate</b> forbidden <b>fat that is the leftover from</b> one of <b>the sacrificial</b> animals <b>on Yom Kippur.</b> If he did this and was unaware of the relevant prohibitions he is liable to bring four sin-offerings, as well as a guilt-offering for deriving benefit from the misuse of consecrated property.
<b>Rabbi Meir says: Also, if it was Shabbat and he transferred</b> the item from one domain to another in his mouth, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for performing labor on Shabbat as well. The Rabbis <b>said to him: This is not</b> a prohibition <b>of the</b> same <b>type,</b> since in the case of Rabbi Meir’s additional prohibition he does not violate it by eating.
Rava, son of Rabba, explains the objection that arises from the mishna: <b>And if it is so</b> that a more inclusive prohibition takes effect, then <b>you find</b> a case where one is liable for the violation of <b>five</b> prohibitions in one act of eating, <b>such as where</b> one <b>says</b> in the aforementioned situation: On my <b>oath I will not eat dates and</b> forbidden <b>fat. Since</b> the oath <b>takes effect with regard to the dates, it also takes effect with regard to the</b> forbidden <b>fat.</b> The fact that the mishna fails to mention such an oath indicates that a more inclusive prohibition does not take effect where another prohibition is already in place.
The Gemara answers: The absence of an oath with a more inclusive prohibition in the mishna does not indicate anything. <b>When</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the scenario above, he lists only the potential <b>prohibitions that occur on their own</b> in one act of eating, but <b>he does not teach prohibitions that occur by</b> the act of the person <b>himself.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> the mishna include in its list the prohibition against deriving benefit from <b>consecrated</b> property, which does not occur on its own but only when an item is consecrated?
The Gemara answers: The case in the mishna is that of <b>a first-born</b> animal, <b>whose sanctity is from the womb,</b> i.e., begins automatically at birth.
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead, in response to the question, that <b>when</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> it, he includes only <b>matters to which</b> presenting <b>a request</b> for dissolution <b>do not apply. An oath, to which a request</b> for dissolution <b>applies, is not taught.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> the mishna include in its list the prohibition against deriving benefit from <b>consecrated</b> property? Consecration can be dissolved by a Sage.
The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t we</b> already <b>establish</b> that the case in the mishna is that of <b>a firstborn</b> animal, whose sanctity cannot be dissolved?
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead that <b>when he teaches</b> that case, he lists only those prohibitions for which one is liable to bring <b>a fixed</b> sin-<b>offering.</b> If one breaks his oath he is liable to bring <b>a sliding-scale offering,</b> and the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>does not teach</b> about the liability to bring other offerings.
The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> the mishna list the transgression of <b>an impure</b> person <b>who ate consecrated</b> items, i.e., the sacrificial animals mentioned in the mishna, <b>which is</b> a prohibition for which one brings <b>a sliding-scale offering?</b>
The Gemara answers: The mishna is referring <b>to a king</b> who eats the leftover of a sacrificial animal while impure, <b>and</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says:</b> A ritually impure <b>king</b> who ate consecrated items <b>brings</b> a male <b>goat</b> as a sin-offering, rather than the sliding-scale offering brought by a commoner.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> there is a different answer: <b>When</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> this case, he lists only <b>matters that apply</b> when one eats the <b>measure</b> of an olive-bulk, whereas the case of <b>an oath, which applies to</b> eating even <b>less than</b> the standard <b>measure, is not taught</b> in the mishna.
The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> the mishna include in its list the prohibition against deriving benefit from the misuse of <b>consecrated</b> property, which applies to eating even less than an olive-bulk?
The Gemara answers: <b>We require</b> that one derive the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i></b> of benefit in order to be liable, so that is also a prohibition to which standard measures apply.
<b>And Rav Ashi of Avireya said</b> that <b>Rabbi Zeira</b> said: <b>When</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> this case, he lists only prohibitions for which <b>intentional</b> violation <b>of</b> them renders one liable to receive <b><i>karet</i>,</b> and <b>he does not teach prohibitions</b> for which <b>intentional</b> violation <b>of</b> them renders one liable to receive lashes.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> the <b>guilt-offering</b> for the misuse of consecrated property, which is listed in the mishna, <b>a prohibition</b> for <b>which intentional</b> violation <b>of it</b> renders one liable to receive only lashes, not <i>karet</i>? <b>And</b> nevertheless the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> it.

Daf 25a

The Gemara answers: <b>We are speaking of sin-offerings</b> when we assert that that mishna lists only prohibitions for which one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for their intentional violation.
<b>Ravina</b> offered a different answer. He <b>said: When</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> this case, he lists only <b>those</b> prohibitions <b>that apply</b> specifically <b>to items that are edible.</b> With regard to <b>an oath,</b> it is a matter <b>that applies</b> also <b>to items that are not edible,</b> and he <b>does not teach</b> it in that mishna.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> that mishna include in its list the prohibition against deriving benefit from the misuse of <b>consecrated</b> property, <b>which applies even to</b> consecrated <b>wood and stones?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, when</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> this case, he lists <b>those</b> prohibitions <b>that apply to tangible matters.</b> With regard to <b>an oath,</b> it is something <b>that</b> also <b>applies to intangible matters, such as: I will sleep, or: I will not sleep,</b> and the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> it in that mishna.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one unwittingly takes a false oath about the past or breaks an oath he made about the future, <b>both</b> if it is an oath that addresses <b>matters that concern oneself and</b> if it is an oath that addresses <b>matters that concern others,</b> he is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering for an oath on an utterance. <b>And</b> likewise, an oath on an utterance may address <b>both tangible matters and intangible matters.</b>
<b>How so?</b> Examples of oaths about future actions that concern others are if one <b>said:</b> On my <b>oath I will give so-and-so</b> a particular item, <b>or:</b> On my oath <b>I will not give</b> it to him. Examples of such oaths about the past are if one said: On my oath <b>I gave</b> another a particular item, <b>or:</b> On my oath <b>I did not give</b> it to him.
Examples of oaths about the future that address intangible matters are where one said: On my oath <b>I will sleep, or:</b> On my oath <b>I will not sleep.</b> Examples of such oaths about the past are where one said: On my oath <b>I slept, or:</b> On my oath <b>I did not sleep.</b> Other examples of oaths about intangible matters are when one takes an oath, saying: <b>I will throw a stone into the sea, or: I will not throw</b> it, or: <b>I threw</b> it, <b>or: I did not throw</b> it.
<b>Rabbi Yishmael says: One is liable only</b> for an oath on an utterance taken <b>about the future, as it is stated:</b> “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips <b>to do evil, or to do good,</b> whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath” (Leviticus 5:4). The Torah refers explicitly only to oaths about what one will do in the future.
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: If so,</b> and one is liable only for oaths explicitly mentioned in the verse, then <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good apply. From where</b> do I derive that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good do not apply?</b>
Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him:</b> The <i>halakha</i> in these cases is derived <b>by amplification of</b> the meaning of <b>the verse.</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: If the verse is amplified for this,</b> i.e., to extend the <i>halakha</i> of an oath on an utterance to matters that do not involve doing evil or good, <b>the verse is amplified for that,</b> i.e., oaths about the past.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to oaths about intangible matters, <b>the Sages taught:</b> There is <b>a stringency</b> that applies <b>to vows</b> and not <b>to oaths,</b> and there is <b>a stringency</b> that applies <b>to oaths</b> and not <b>to vows.</b> The <b>stringency</b> that applies <b>to vows</b> is <b>that vows take effect with regard to a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva, like</b> they take effect with regard to <b>an optional matter, which is not the case with regard to oaths.</b> An oath not to perform a mitzva does not take effect at all.
The <b>stringency</b> that applies <b>to oaths</b> is <b>that oaths take effect with regard to an intangible matter like</b> they do with regard to <b>a tangible matter, which is not the case with regard to vows.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>How so?</b> Examples are if one <b>said:</b> On my <b>oath I will give so-and-so</b> some item, <b>or:</b> On my oath <b>I will not give</b> it to him. <b>What</b> is the case of an oath in which he says: <b>I will give? If we say</b> that he takes an oath that he will give <b>charity to a poor person,</b> that is not an oath that takes effect, since <b>he is under oath from Mount Sinai</b> to give charity, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to a poor person: <b>“You shall give him”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:10).
<b>Rather,</b> the case is where he said he would give <b>a gift to a rich person.</b> The oath takes effect, as there is no mitzva to do so.
§ The mishna teaches that if one takes an oath, saying: <b>I will sleep, or: I will not sleep,</b> the oath takes effect and he is liable to bring an offering if he fails to fulfill the terms of his oath. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that in the case of <b>one who says:</b> On my <b>oath I will not sleep for three days,</b> the court <b>flogs him immediately and he may sleep.</b> Since it is impossible for one not to sleep for three days, his oath is regarded as an oath taken in vain from the outset. How could someone who took an oath never to sleep be liable to bring an offering for an oath on an utterance if he slept unwittingly?
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan is referring to a case <b>where he said</b> explicitly that he will not sleep for <b>three</b> days. <b>Here,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he did not say three</b> days, and his oath extends only for the amount of time it is possible not to sleep.
§ The mishna teaches that an example of an oath on an utterance is where one took an oath, saying: <b>I will throw a stone into the sea, or: I will not throw</b> it. It <b>was stated:</b> With regard to one who says: On my <b>oath so-and-so threw a stone into the sea, or:</b> On my <b>oath he did not throw</b> it, <b>Rav says:</b> If it was later discovered that what he said was false, he is <b>liable</b> to bring an offering for his oath. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> He is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara explains the opinions: <b>Rav says</b> that he is <b>liable,</b> as the oath <b>can be positive or negative.</b> The Sages derived from the verse: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips to do evil, or to do good” (Leviticus 5:4), that one is liable to bring an offering for an oath on an utterance only when the oath is such that it could be inverted from the positive to the negative and vice versa. Since he can take an oath either that he threw the stone or that he did not, he is liable. <b>And Shmuel says</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> because the oath <b>cannot be</b> stated <b>with regard to the future;</b> he cannot control what so-and-so will do in the future. Consequently, it is an oath taken in vain, rather than an oath on an utterance.
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva? As we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: One is liable only</b> for an oath on an utterance taken <b>about the future, as it is stated:</b> “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips <b>to do evil, or to do good,</b> whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath” (Leviticus 5:4). <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: If so,</b> and one is liable only for oaths explicitly mentioned in the verse, then <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good apply. From where</b> do I derive that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good do not apply?</b>
Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him:</b> The <i>halakha</i> in these cases is derived <b>by amplification of the verse.</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: If the verse is amplified for this,</b> i.e., to extend the <i>halakha</i> of an oath on an utterance to matters that do not involve doing evil or good, <b>the verse is amplified for that,</b> i.e., oaths about the past.
Say <b>that Rav,</b> who ruled that one who took an oath that so-and-so threw a stone into the sea is liable, <b>states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> that one can be liable for oaths about the past. <b>And</b> say <b>that Shmuel states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> that one is exempt from liability for taking an oath about the past.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Everyone agrees</b> that <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael</b> one is exempt from liability for taking an oath that so-and-so threw an item. <b>Now,</b> with regard to <b>a statement,</b> i.e., an oath, <b>that could be</b> a valid oath referring <b>to the future,</b> e.g., I will throw an item, <b>Rabbi Yishmael does not deem</b> one <b>liable for it</b> when it refers <b>to the past. Is it necessary</b> to say that one is not liable for <b>a statement,</b> i.e., an oath, that so-and-so threw a particular item, <b>that cannot be</b> a valid oath when adjusted to be referring <b>to</b> someone else’s actions in <b>the future,</b> since it is not under the oath taker’s control?
<b>When they disagree,</b> it is with regard to how to understand the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva.</b> The opinion of <b>Rav</b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> without any qualification of it. <b>And Shmuel says: Rabbi Akiva deems one liable only there,</b> in the case of an oath that refers <b>to the past,</b> when it is <b>a statement,</b> i.e., an oath, <b>that could be</b> a valid oath referring <b>to the future;</b> in such a case <b>Rabbi Akiva deems one liable</b> also if the oath was taken referring <b>to the past,</b> like an oath where one says: I threw a stone. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>statements that cannot</b> be valid oaths if adjusted <b>to the future,</b> like an oath about another’s action, he does <b>not</b> deem one liable when they are made about the past.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>the dispute</b>

Daf 25b

between these <i>amora’im</i> parallels the <b>disagreement</b> between <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira and the Rabbis? As we learned</b> in a mishna (27a): If one <b>took an oath to refrain from</b> performing <b>a mitzva and he did not refrain,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering for an oath on an utterance. If one took an oath <b>to perform a mitzva and he did not perform</b> it, he is also <b>exempt, though it would have been fitting</b> to argue <b>that he is liable</b> to bring the offering, <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira. As Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira said: What? If,</b> with regard to an oath concerning <b>an optional</b> matter, <b>for which one is not under oath from Mount Sinai, he is liable for</b> breaking <b>it,</b> then with regard to an oath about <b>a mitzva, for which he is under oath from Mount Sinai, is it not logical that he would be liable for it?</b>
The Rabbis <b>said to him: No, if you said</b> that one is liable <b>for</b> breaking <b>an oath</b> concerning <b>an optional</b> action, <b>where</b> the Torah <b>rendered</b> one liable for <b>a negative</b> oath not to perform it <b>like</b> for <b>a positive</b> oath to perform it, <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> one is liable <b>for</b> breaking <b>an oath</b> concerning <b>a mitzva, where</b> the Torah <b>did not render</b> one liable for <b>a negative</b> oath <b>like</b> for <b>a positive</b> oath? If one takes an oath to refrain from performing a mitzva and he did not refrain, he is exempt.
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Rav states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira,</b> who holds that one can be liable for an oath that cannot be inverted, <b>and Shmuel states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> that of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that one can be liable only if the oath can be inverted?
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Everyone,</b> i.e., both Rav and Shmuel, <b>agrees with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira</b> that one is liable if he took an oath that so-and-so performed an action that he did not in fact perform. The Gemara explains: <b>Now,</b> given that Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira <b>does not require</b> that it be possible to invert <b>a negative</b> oath to <b>a positive</b> oath, <b>does he require</b> that it be possible for an oath to refer <b>to the future as well as to the past?</b> Shmuel explained that the reason one is not liable for an oath that so-and-so threw a stone into the sea is that it cannot be inverted to address the future, in other words: So-and-so will throw a stone into the sea, as that is not under the oath taker’s control.
<b>When they disagree</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis: Shmuel</b> holds <b>like the Rabbis,</b> that one is exempt in the case of an oath that cannot be inverted. Accordingly, Shmuel ruled that one who takes an oath that so-and-so threw an item is exempt from bringing an offering if it is found that the statement was false. <b>And Rav</b> holds that <b>the Rabbis do not deem one liable in</b> the case of an oath that cannot be inverted from <b>negative</b> to <b>positive</b> or vice versa, <b>as it is written explicitly:</b> “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips <b>to do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). <b>But</b> with regard to the requirement that it be possible to invert an oath referring <b>to the future</b> to refer <b>to the past</b> or vice versa, <b>which is derived from an amplification of</b> the meaning of <b>the verses,</b> the Rabbis <b>deem one liable,</b> as they do not accept the derivation.
<b>Rav Hamnuna raises an objection</b> to Shmuel’s opinion from a mishna (29b): If one said: <b>I did not eat today, or: I did not don phylacteries today,</b> and another said to him: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> that your statement is true, <b>and</b> the original speaker <b>said: Amen,</b> he is <b>liable</b> for breaking an oath on an utterance if his statement was false, as responding amen to an oath administered to oneself is equivalent to stating the oath explicitly. <b>Granted,</b> he is liable in the case where he said: <b>I did not eat,</b> since it also <b>would have been possible</b> for him to take an oath saying: <b>I will not eat, but</b> in the case where he said: <b>I did not don</b> phylacteries, <b>would it have been possible</b> for him to take an oath saying: <b>I will not don</b> phylacteries, and in doing so abrogate a positive mitzva?
<b>He,</b> Rav Hamnuna, <b>raises the objection and he resolves it:</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> this mishna <b>disjunctively,</b> referring to two different cases. When he teaches that one is liable for taking the oath: <b>I did not eat,</b> it refers to one’s liability <b>to</b> bring <b>an offering.</b> When he teaches liability for the oath: <b>I did not don</b> phylacteries, it refers to one’s liability <b>to</b> receive <b>lashes</b> for taking a false oath. This liability does not require that it be possible to invert the oath to refer to the future.
<b>Rava</b> also <b>raises an objection</b> to Shmuel’s opinion from a mishna (see 29a): <b>Which</b> oath <b>is an oath</b> taken <b>in vain?</b> It is when one <b>takes an oath to deny that which is known to people</b> to be true, <b>and,</b> for example, <b>says about a stone column that is in such and such a place that it is</b> made <b>of gold. And Ulla says</b> that the phrase: Known to people, in the mishna is referring to when <b>it is</b> a fact <b>that is known to three people.</b> The Gemara explains the objection to Shmuel’s opinion: <b>The reason</b> he is liable for taking an oath in vain is due to the fact <b>that</b> his oath contradicted a fact <b>known</b> to three people. <b>But</b> if it is <b>not known, he violates</b> the prohibition <b>of</b> taking a false <b>oath on an utterance.</b> Given Shmuel’s opinion, <b>why</b> should he be liable? <b>Isn’t it impossible</b> to invert the oath to make it about the future, saying: That column <b>will be of gold?</b>
<b>He raises the objection and he resolves it.</b> When the fact is <b>known</b> to three people, the one who takes an oath denying it <b>violates</b> the prohibition <b>of</b> taking <b>an oath in vain.</b> If it is <b>not known,</b> then <b>he violates</b> the prohibition <b>of</b> taking <b>a false oath,</b> for which he receives lashes if he did so intentionally. Nevertheless, he is not liable to bring an offering for falsely taking an oath on an utterance, since this oath cannot be inverted to be about the future.
§ <b>Abaye said: And Rav,</b> who holds one liable for an oath on an utterance even if it cannot be inverted to refer to the future, <b>concedes</b> in a case <b>where one says to another:</b> On my <b>oath I know testimony</b> that is relevant <b>to you, and it is found</b> afterward <b>that he did not know</b> testimony that was relevant <b>to him,</b> that in <b>that</b> case <b>he is exempt</b> from bringing an offering for an oath on an utterance. The reason is <b>that it is not in the category of</b> an oath that could be inverted to the negative oath of: <b>I do not know testimony</b> that is relevant <b>to you,</b> as that oath would be an oath of testimony, rather than an oath on an utterance. The Torah states: “And if anyone sin, in that he hears the voice of adjuration, he being a witness, whether he has seen or known, if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity” (Leviticus 5:1). One is liable to bring an offering for an oath of testimony if he takes an oath falsely denying that he has knowledge of testimony in a monetary matter.
But if he takes an oath saying: <b>I knew</b> testimony that is relevant to you, <b>or: I did not know</b> testimony that is relevant to you, the <i>halakha</i> is subject to the <b>dispute</b> between Rav and Shmuel. Similarly, if he took an oath saying: <b>I testified, or: I did not testify,</b> whether or not he is liable to bring an offering for an oath on an utterance depends on the <b>dispute</b> between Rav and Shmuel. In these cases, the oaths cannot be inverted from the past to the future and are also not oaths of testimony, since they do not involve the refusal to testify.
The Gemara says: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who says</b> that an oath about <b>a matter that cannot</b> be inverted to refer <b>to the future</b> is one <b>for which one is not liable</b> when it refers <b>to the past,</b> it is <b>for that</b> reason <b>the Merciful One removed an oath of testimony,</b> which cannot be inverted, <b>from the category of an oath on an utterance</b> and legislated it in a separate verse (see Leviticus 5:1). <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, for what <i>halakha</i> did the Merciful One remove it</b> from the category of an oath on an utterance and relate to it as a distinct category? Every oath of testimony is a case of an oath on an utterance and there is no need to relate to it as a special case.
<b>The Sages said before Abaye:</b> An oath of testimony is singled out, according to Rav, in order <b>to render</b> one who takes it falsely <b>liable</b> to bring <b>two</b> sliding-scale offerings <b>for it,</b> one for a false oath on an utterance and one for a false oath of testimony.
Abaye <b>said to them: You cannot say</b> that one who takes a false oath of testimony is liable to bring <b>two</b> offerings, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the sliding-scale offering that is brought for both an oath of testimony and an oath on an utterance: The verse states: “And it shall be, when he shall be guilty <b>in one of these things”</b> (Leviticus 5:5). By inference, <b>for one</b> of the sins that render one liable to bring a sliding-scale offering <b>you may deem him liable, but you may not deem him liable</b> for <b>two.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if this is so, then <b>according to Abaye’s</b> understanding of the opinion of Rav, <b>for what <i>halakha</i> did the Merciful One remove</b> an oath of testimony from the category of an oath on an utterance and relate to it as a distinct category?
The Gemara answers: An oath of testimony is singled out, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>For every</b> other one of the prohibitions for which one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering, it <b>is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And it is hidden</b> from him” (see Leviticus 5:2–4), <b>and here,</b> with regard to the oath of testimony, the phrase: <b>And it is hidden</b> from him, <b>is not stated.</b> This serves <b>to render</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for</b> taking a false oath of testimony <b>intentionally like</b> one who is liable for doing so <b>unwittingly.</b>
<b>The Sages said to Abaye: Say</b> that the oath of testimony was singled out for a different reason: When he takes a false oath of testimony <b>intentionally he is liable</b> to bring only <b>one</b> offering but when he does so <b>unwittingly, he is liable</b> to bring <b>two,</b> one for an oath of testimony and one for an oath on an utterance.
Abaye <b>said to them</b> in response: <b>Is this not what they said</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse about the sliding-scale offering: “When he shall be guilty <b>in one of these</b> things” (Leviticus 5:5)? By inference, <b>for one</b> of the sins that render one liable to bring a sliding-scale offering <b>you may deem him liable, but you may not deem him liable</b> for <b>two? And</b> since one does not bring an offering for an intentional false oath on an utterance, <b>if</b> the verse is referring to a case where he <b>intentionally</b> took a false oath of testimony, <b>how could there be</b> a case where one is liable to bring <b>two</b> offerings such that this case needs to be excluded? Consequently, the verse must be referring to a case where he took the oath unwittingly, and it teaches that nevertheless, one brings only one offering for each violation.
<b>Rava said</b> in response to the question posed by the Sages: There is no need to derive from a verse that one is liable to bring only one offering for a false oath of testimony. <b>Since</b> an oath of testimony <b>is a matter that was</b> included <b>in a generalization,</b> i.e., the general principle of an oath on an utterance, <b>and</b> it <b>was singled out to teach a new matter with regard to it, you have only the new matter alone</b> to consider. Since an oath of testimony is singled out in that it applies only to potential witnesses in the context of a court, a case of an oath of testimony ceases to be included under the rubric of an oath on an utterance.
The Gemara asks: Should one understand <b>by inference that Abaye holds</b> that in cases of an oath of testimony, <b>the oath</b> on an utterance still <b>exists in principle?</b> One does not bring two offerings because of the <i>halakha</i> derived from the verse, but if for some reason the oath of testimony does not take effect, one may still be liable for an oath on an utterance.
<b>But didn’t Abaye say</b> that <b>Rav concedes</b> that one is exempt from bringing an offering for an oath on an utterance in a case <b>where one says to another:</b> On my <b>oath I know testimony</b> that is relevant <b>to you, and it was found that he did not know</b> testimony that was relevant <b>to him?</b> In <b>that</b> case he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering for an oath on utterance, <b>since it is not</b> an oath that could be inverted <b>to</b> the negative oath: <b>I do not know testimony</b> that is relevant <b>to you,</b> as that oath would be an oath of testimony rather than an oath on an utterance.
The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye retracted that</b> opinion. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that

Daf 26a

<b>Rav Pappa said one of those</b> statements, not Abaye.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: One is liable only</b> for an oath on an utterance taken <b>about the future. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to an oath on an utterance: From the verse: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips <b>to do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good apply. From where</b> do I derive that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good do not apply? The verse states: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips,”</b> which includes other matters.
<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for oaths referring <b>to the future. From where</b> do I derive that one is liable for oaths referring <b>to the past? The verse</b> subsequently <b>states: “Whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath”</b> (Leviticus 5:4); this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> The verse states: <b>“To do evil, or to do good,”</b> referring exclusively to oaths <b>about the future.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: If so,</b> then <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good apply. From where</b> do I derive that one is liable for an oath on an utterance with regard to <b>matters to which doing evil and doing good do not apply?</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to</b> Rabbi Akiva in response: It is derived <b>from an amplification</b> of the meaning <b>of the verse.</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: If the verse is amplified for this,</b> i.e., to extend the <i>halakha</i> of an oath on an utterance to matters that do not involve doing evil or good, <b>the verse is amplified for that,</b> i.e., oaths about the past.
The Gemara questions: <b>Rabbi Akiva said well</b> his critique of the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael.</b> Why does Rabbi Yishmael disagree?
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is because <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> was the one <b>who served</b> as a disciple of <b>Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana, who would interpret the entire Torah with</b> the hermeneutical principle of <b>a generalization and a detail.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yishmael <b>also interprets</b> the Torah <b>with</b> the method of <b>a generalization and a detail. Rabbi Akiva</b> was one <b>who served</b> as a disciple of <b>Naḥum of Gam Zo, who would interpret the entire Torah with</b> the hermeneutical principle of <b>amplification and restriction.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Akiva <b>also interprets</b> the Torah by <b>amplification and restriction.</b>
<b>What</b> is the specific instance in this context where one finds <b>that Rabbi Akiva interprets</b> with <b>amplifications and restrictions?</b> It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that when the verse states: <b>“Or if anyone take an oath</b> clearly with his lips” (Leviticus 5:4), it <b>amplifies</b> the range of possible oaths for which one could be liable to bring an offering for an oath on an utterance. When the verse continues: <b>“To do evil, or to do good,”</b> it <b>restricts</b> that range. When it further continues: <b>“Whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly</b> with an oath,” it <b>then amplifies</b> again. According to the hermeneutical principle that when a verse <b>amplified, and</b> then <b>restricted, and</b> then <b>amplified, it amplified</b> the relevant category to include <b>everything</b> except for the specific matter that was excluded by the restriction.
<b>What</b> was included when the verse <b>amplified</b> the range of liability? <b>It amplified</b> it to include <b>all matters</b> about which one might take an oath. <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way did it <b>restrict</b> it when it continued: “To do evil, or to do good”? It <b>restricted</b> the range of liability for an oath on an utterance to exclude an oath that is <b>a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva,</b> i.e., an oath to refrain from performing a mitzva.
<b>And Rabbi Yishmael interprets</b> the verse following the hermeneutical principle of <b>a generalization and a detail: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips”</b> (Leviticus 5:4), is <b>a generalization; “to do evil, or to do good,”</b> is <b>a detail; “whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly</b> with an oath,” the verse <b>then</b> further <b>generalized.</b> There is a hermeneutical principle that when a verse contains <b>a generalization, and a detail, and</b> another <b>generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail. Just as the detail</b> in the verse is <b>explicitly</b> an oath referring <b>to the future, so too, all</b> the oaths for which one is liable must be referring <b>to the future.</b>
<b>The generalization serves to include even</b> those <b>matters that do not concern doing evil or doing good</b> when they refer <b>to the future; the detail serves to exclude even matters that concern doing evil or doing good</b> when they refer <b>to the past.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>I will reverse</b> it and say that the generalization serves to include oaths concerning the past, and the detail serves to exclude matters that do not involve doing evil or doing good. Why is that not an equally legitimate interpretation of the verse?
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that Rabbi Yishmael understands that liability is extended to one whose oath <b>is similar to an oath “to do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). <b>He whose prohibition is due to</b> the verse<b>: “He shall not break his word”</b> (Numbers 30:3), is liable, as liability for an oath about the future entails breaking one’s word. <b>Excluded is that</b> oath <b>whose prohibition is not due to</b> the verse<b>: “He shall not break his word”; rather,</b> it is <b>due to</b> the verse<b>: “You shall not lie”</b> (Leviticus 19:11), since liability for an oath about the past applies when the oath itself was a lie.
<b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avin says</b> that there is a different explanation of Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion: <b>The verse states: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips</b> to do evil, or to do good,” referring to <b>one whose oath precedes</b> its <b>clarification,</b> i.e., the action that breaks it, <b>and not</b> to one who takes an oath <b>where the clarification,</b> i.e., the action prohibited in the oath, <b>precedes the oath. Excluded is that</b> oath where one said, for example: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat, where the action precedes the oath.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Or if anyone take an oath clearly with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall utter clearly with an oath, and it is hidden from him; and, when he knows of it, be guilty in one of these things” (Leviticus 5:4). The phrase <b>“a man…with an oath”</b> serves <b>to exclude a victim of circumstances beyond his control</b> from liability to bring an offering. The term <b>“and it is hidden”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> from liability one who broke his oath <b>intentionally,</b> as he does not deserve to be able to achieve atonement through bringing an offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The term <b>“from him”</b> teaches that <b>one who was unaware of</b> his <b>oath,</b> i.e., forgot it, and subsequently broke it, is liable to bring an offering. One <b>might</b> have thought that an oath taker is also liable when he broke an oath <b>because he was unaware</b> that a particular item is forbidden as the <b>object</b> of his oath; therefore, <b>the verse states: “With an oath, and it is hidden from him.” He is liable for lack of awareness of the oath but he is not liable for lack of awareness of the object</b> of the oath.
<b>The Master says</b> above in the <i>baraita</i>: The phrase <b>“a man…with an oath”</b> serves <b>to exclude a victim of circumstances beyond his control.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> such <b>circumstances?</b>
The Gemara answers: It is <b>as</b> it was <b>with Rav Kahana and Rav Asi,</b> who, <b>when they were standing up in the presence of Rav,</b> their teacher, at the conclusion of a lesson, disagreed with regard to exactly what he said. One <b>Sage said:</b> On my <b>oath Rav said like this, and</b> the other <b>Sage said:</b> On my <b>oath Rav said like that. When they came before Rav</b> to clarify what he had said, <b>he stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> what <b>one of them</b> had said. <b>The other said to</b> Rav: <b>Did I</b> then <b>take a false oath?</b>
Rav <b>said to him: Your heart compelled you.</b> It is not regarded as a false oath, since at the time that you took the oath you were certain that you were telling the truth.
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches: The phrase <b>“and it is hidden from him”</b> teaches that <b>one who was unaware of his oath,</b> i.e., forgot it, and subsequently broke it, is liable to bring an offering. One <b>might</b> have thought that the oath taker is also liable when he broke the oath <b>because he was unaware</b> that a particular item is forbidden as the <b>object</b> of his oath; therefore, <b>the verse states: “With an oath, and it is hidden from him.” He is liable for lack of awareness of the oath, but he is not liable for lack of awareness of the object</b> of the oath.
<b>They laughed at this in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, and said: <b>Granted, you find</b> lack of awareness of one’s <b>oath without</b> there being lack of awareness of <b>the object</b> of the oath, as in a case <b>where one said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat wheat bread, and he thought he had said: I will eat</b> wheat bread, <b>as</b> in that case <b>his oath is forgotten</b> and <b>the object</b> of it <b>is remembered. But</b> under <b>what circumstances</b> is there a case of lack of awareness of <b>the object</b> of the oath <b>without</b> lack of awareness of the <b>oath</b> itself?
The Gemara suggests: It can be found in a case <b>where he said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat wheat bread, and he thought he had said:</b> On my oath I will not eat <b>barley</b> bread, <b>as</b> in that case <b>his oath is remembered by him</b> and <b>the object</b> of it <b>is forgotten.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Once the object</b> of the oath <b>is forgotten by him, that is</b> a case of <b>lack of awareness of his oath.</b>
<b>Rather, Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The distinction made in the <i>baraita</i> between lack of awareness of one’s oath and lack of awareness of the object of one’s oath is not valid, and both <b>this and that are one</b> and the same.
<b>Rav Yosef objects to this.</b> Is it <b>really</b> the case that <b>you do not find</b> a case of lack of awareness of <b>the object</b> of an oath <b>without</b> lack of awareness of the <b>oath? But you find</b> it in a case <b>where he said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat wheat bread, and he extended his hand to the basket to take barley bread, and wheat</b> bread <b>came up in his hand, and he thought it was barley</b> bread <b>and ate it.</b> That is a case <b>where his oath is remembered by him, and it is the object</b> of the oath <b>of which he is unaware.</b>
<b>Abaye said to him: Don’t you deem him liable</b> to bring <b>an offering</b> for breaking his oath <b>only for that which he holds in his hand</b> and eats? When he eats the bread, that <b>is lack of awareness of the oath,</b> since he thinks that the item in his hand is permitted.
The Gemara presents <b>another formulation</b> of this statement. <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Ultimately, the offering he brings for this bread is in any event</b> due to <b>lack of awareness of the oath,</b> as he thinks that the item in his hand is permitted.
<b>And Rav Yosef</b> could <b>say to you: Since were he to know of it that it is wheat</b> bread <b>he would refrain from</b> eating <b>it,</b> this should be regarded as a case of <b>lack of awareness of the object.</b>
<b>Rava asked of Rav Naḥman:</b> In a case where one <b>has a lack of awareness of this,</b> the oath, <b>and that,</b> its object, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: He</b> breaks the oath while <b>having a lack of awareness of the oath and</b> is therefore <b>liable.</b> Rava replied: <b>On the contrary, he has a lack of awareness of the object</b> of the oath <b>and</b> should therefore be <b>exempt.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said: We see: If he refrains</b> from eating <b>due to the oath,</b> i.e., when he is reminded that he took an oath, <b>he had a lack of awareness of the oath and is liable. If he refrains due to the object</b> of the oath, i.e., when he is reminded what it is he is about to eat, <b>he had a lack of awareness due to the object, and is exempt.</b>
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Doesn’t he refrain only from</b> breaking the <b>oath due to</b> his recognition of the <b>object? Doesn’t he refrain from</b> the <b>object due only to</b> the <b>oath?</b> In either case, he needs to remember both the oath and its object, and the manner in which he was reminded does not serve to indicate anything. <b>Rather, there is no difference</b> between the two.
<b>Rava asked of Rav Naḥman:</b>

Daf 26b

<b>What is</b> the case of <b>an unwitting oath on an utterance</b> referring <b>to the past,</b> for which one is liable to bring an offering? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where he knows</b> when he takes the oath that it is not true, then <b>he is an intentional</b> taker of a false oath and may not bring an offering. <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where he did not know</b> at the time of taking the oath that what he was saying is not true, then <b>he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control,</b> and is exempt from bringing an offering.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him</b> in answer to his question: It is a case <b>where</b> the one taking the oath <b>says: I know that</b> taking <b>this oath is prohibited, but I do not know if one is liable</b> to bring <b>an offering for it or not.</b> Since he does not know the full implications of his action, it is regarded as unwitting, and he may still bring an offering to atone for it.
Rava asked Rav Naḥman further: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion do you answer in this way? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Munbaz, who says: Lack of intention with regard to the offering,</b> i.e., ignorance as to whether one’s action renders one liable to bring an offering, <b>is regarded as lack of intention?</b> There is a dispute between Munbaz and the Rabbis in tractate <i>Shabbat</i> (69a–b) with regard to one who knows that a particular action desecrates Shabbat but does not know that it renders one liable to bring a sin-offering. Munbaz holds that even one who is merely ignorant of the liability to bring an offering is deemed an unwitting sinner who brings a sin-offering to atone. The Rabbis disagree and deem him unwitting only if he is unaware that the action is prohibited.
Rav Naḥman explains: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that this explanation accords with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. The Rabbis disagree with</b> the opinion <b>of Munbaz only with regard to all</b> typical cases in <b>the entire Torah</b> for which one is liable to bring a sin-offering, where that liability <b>is not a novelty. But here,</b> with regard to oaths, it could be said <b>that</b> bringing a sin-offering <b>is a novelty, since</b> there is a principle that <b>we do not find in the entire Torah</b> another example of a simple <b>prohibition for which</b> one <b>brings an offering</b> for its unwitting violation.
Rav Naḥman continues: The reason for this principle is <b>that we derive</b> for which prohibitions one brings a sin-offering <b>from</b> the prohibition of <b>idol worship,</b> where one is liable to receive <i>karet</i> for an intentional violation and one is liable to bring a sin-offering for an unwitting violation. <b>And</b> yet <b>here,</b> in the case of the oath, <b>one brings</b> a sin-offering even though intentional violation of the prohibition is not punishable by <i>karet</i>. Given the novelty of the offering for an oath on an utterance, <b>even the Rabbis would agree</b> that ignorance of the fact that one is performing an action for which the Torah legislates an offering is sufficient for one to be regarded as unwitting and liable to bring a sliding-scale offering.
<b>Ravina asked Rava:</b> If one <b>took an oath concerning</b> a certain <b>loaf,</b> rendering himself prohibited from eating it, <b>and</b> later his life <b>is in danger</b> due to his not eating it, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he liable to bring an offering in atonement for eating it?
Rava responded: If his life is <b>in danger, let the Master permit him</b> to eat, as saving his life overrides the prohibition; he is considered a victim of circumstances beyond his control and does not need to atone at all. Ravina said: <b>Rather,</b> the question is this: With regard to <b>one who is suffering</b> from hunger <b>and</b> who <b>ate it unwittingly,</b> i.e., he forgot the prohibition generated by the <b>oath,</b> although had he known, he would still have eaten this loaf of bread intentionally due to his hunger, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?
Rava said <b>to him: We learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One</b> who, had he known that his action was prohibited, would have <b>withdrawn</b> from sinning <b>due to his knowledge, brings an offering for his unwitting</b> sin; but <b>one</b> who <b>would not have withdrawn</b> from sinning <b>due to his knowledge does not bring an offering for his unwitting</b> sin. Since he would have eaten anyway, he does not bring an offering.
§ <b>Shmuel says:</b> Even after one <b>decided</b> to take an oath, he <b>needs to express</b> it <b>with his lips</b> for it to take effect, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: “Or if anyone take an oath <b>clearly with his lips</b> to do evil, or to do good” (Leviticus 5:4).
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states that one takes an oath <b>“with his lips,” but not with his heart. From where</b> is it derived that <b>one who decided in his heart</b> to take an oath is liable to bring an offering for an oath on an utterance? <b>The verse states: “Whatsoever it be that a man shall express with an oath”</b> (Leviticus 5:4).
The Gemara points out: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> is <b>difficult</b> in <b>itself. You said: “With his lips,” but not with his heart, and then you said: From where</b> is it derived that <b>one who decided in his heart</b> to take an oath is liable? There seems to be a contradiction within the <i>baraita</i> concerning the <i>halakha</i> where one did not express the oath.
<b>Rav Sheshet said: This</b> is <b>not difficult; this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> One takes an oath <b>“with his lips” and</b> does <b>not</b> take an oath <b>when he</b> merely <b>decided in his heart to express with his lips but has not</b> yet actually <b>expressed</b> the oath verbally. <b>From where</b> is it derived that one who <b>simply decided in his heart</b> to take an oath without the intention of stating it with his lips is liable? <b>The verse states: “Whatsoever it be that</b> a man <b>shall express</b> with an oath” (Leviticus 5:4).
The Gemara challenges: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> this <i>baraita</i> nevertheless poses <b>a difficulty,</b> as it indicates that an oath that was not expressed verbally takes effect.
<b>Rav Sheshet said: Resolve</b> the difficulty <b>and say</b> the <i>baraita</i> like <b>this:</b> One takes an oath <b>“with his lips,” but</b> does <b>not</b> take an oath <b>where he decided in his heart to express</b> an oath prohibiting <b>wheat bread and</b> he instead <b>expressed</b> an oath about <b>barley bread. From where</b> is it derived that he is liable where <b>he decided in his heart to express</b> an oath about <b>wheat bread and expressed</b> his oath about <b>bread without specifying? The verse states: “Whatsoever it be that</b> a man <b>shall express</b> with an oath.”
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Shmuel from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“That which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do;</b> according as you have vowed freely to the Lord your God, even that which you have promised with your mouth” (Deuteronomy 23:24). From here <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a case in <b>which he expresses with his lips. From where</b> do I derive a case where <b>he decided</b> only <b>in his heart? The verse states</b> in the context of the contributions to the building of the Tabernacle: “And they came, both men and women, <b>as many as were willinghearted,</b> and brought nose rings, and earrings, and signet rings, and girdles, all jewels of gold” (Exodus 35:22). The fact that the verse describes those who contributed as willinghearted indicates that one becomes liable via a non-verbal decision.
The Gemara answers: The case <b>there,</b> of contributions to the Tabernacle, <b>is different, as it is written: “As many as were willinghearted.”</b> This <i>halakha</i> is stated only in the context of contributions to the Tabernacle, not in the context of oaths.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let us learn from it</b> that in general, oaths can be taken via a non-verbal decision.
The Gemara rejects this: One cannot extrapolate from the fact that the non-verbal consecrations to the Tabernacle were effective, <b>because <i>teruma</i>,</b> which can be separated non-verbally, <b>and</b> donating <b>consecrated</b> items <b>are two verses that come as one,</b> i.e., they are both instances where a non-verbal commitment is sufficient, <b>and any two verses that come as one do not teach</b> their common element to apply to other cases.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that two verses that come as one <b>do not teach</b> their common element, <b>but according to the one who says</b> that <b>they do teach</b> their common element, <b>what can be said?</b>
The Gemara answers: The two contexts here are <b>non-sacred</b> items, i.e., oaths, <b>and consecrated</b> items, donations to the Tabernacle and <i>teruma</i>, <b>and we do not derive</b> <i>halakhot</i> concerning <b>non-sacred</b> items <b>from</b> <i>halakhot</i> concerning <b>consecrated</b> items.

Daf 27a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>takes an oath to refrain from</b> performing <b>a mitzva and he does not refrain,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering for an oath on an utterance. If he takes an oath <b>to perform</b> a mitzva <b>and he does not perform</b> it, he is also <b>exempt, though it would have been fitting</b> to claim <b>that he is liable</b> to bring the offering, <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira.</b>
The mishna explains: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira said: What? If,</b> with regard to an oath concerning <b>an optional</b> matter, <b>for which one is not under oath from Mount Sinai, he is liable for</b> breaking <b>it,</b> then with regard to an oath about <b>a mitzva, for which he is under oath from Mount Sinai, is it not logical that he would be liable for</b> breaking <b>it?</b>
The Rabbis <b>said to him: No, if you said</b> that one is liable <b>for</b> breaking <b>an oath</b> concerning <b>an optional</b> action, <b>where</b> the Torah <b>rendered</b> one liable for <b>a negative</b> oath not to perform it <b>like</b> for <b>a positive</b> oath to perform it, <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> one is liable <b>with regard to</b> breaking <b>an oath</b> concerning <b>a mitzva, where</b> the Torah <b>did not render</b> one liable for <b>a negative</b> oath <b>like</b> for <b>a positive</b> oath, <b>since if one takes an oath to refrain</b> from performing <b>a mitzva and did not refrain,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that when <b>one takes an oath to refrain</b> from performing <b>a mitzva and he does not refrain, he would be liable</b> to bring an offering for an oath on an utterance. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “To do evil, or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4). <b>Just as doing good</b> is referring to an oath about <b>an optional</b> action, <b>so too, doing evil</b> is referring to an oath about <b>an optional</b> action. <b>I will</b> therefore <b>exclude</b> from liability one who <b>takes an oath to refrain from</b> performing <b>a mitzva and does not refrain,</b> so <b>that he is exempt</b> from bringing the offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that when <b>one takes an oath to perform a mitzva and does not perform</b> it, <b>that he would be liable.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “To do evil, or to do good.” Just as doing evil</b> is referring to an oath about <b>an optional</b> action, <b>so too, doing good</b> is referring to an oath about <b>an optional</b> action. <b>I will</b> therefore <b>exclude</b> from liability one who <b>takes an oath to perform a mitzva and does not perform</b> it, so <b>that he is exempt</b> from bringing the offering.
One <b>might</b> have thought that when <b>one takes an oath to harm himself and he does not harm himself, that he could be exempt</b> from liability. <b>The verse states: “To do evil, or to do good.” Just as doing good</b> is referring to an oath about <b>an optional</b> action, <b>so too, doing evil</b> is referring to an oath about <b>an optional</b> action. <b>I include</b> as liable <b>one</b> who <b>takes an oath to harm himself and does not harm</b> himself, <b>since</b> it <b>is his prerogative</b> to harm himself or not.
One <b>might</b> have thought that when <b>one takes an oath to harm others and does not harm</b> them, <b>that he would be liable.</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “To do evil, or to do good.” Just as doing good</b> is referring to an oath about <b>an optional</b> action, <b>so too, doing evil</b> is referring to an oath about <b>an optional</b> action. <b>I will</b> therefore <b>exclude</b> from liability <b>one who takes an oath to harm others and he does not harm</b> them, <b>since</b> it <b>is not his prerogative</b> to do so. <b>From where</b> is it derived that taking an oath that concerns <b>doing good to others is included</b> among the oaths for which one may be liable? <b>The verse states: “Or to do good.” And what is harming others?</b> An example is when one takes an oath saying: <b>I will strike so-and-so and injure his brain.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> assumes throughout that “to do evil, or to do good” is referring to optional actions. The Gemara asks: <b>But from where</b> do we know <b>that</b> these <b>verses are written</b> referring <b>to optional matters? Perhaps</b> they <b>are written</b> referring <b>to matters</b> involving <b>a mitzva.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: This <b>should not enter your mind, since we require</b> that <b>doing good</b> be <b>similar to doing evil, and doing evil</b> be <b>similar to doing good, as doing evil is juxtaposed to doing good</b> in the verse. If one stipulates that the verse is referring to matters involving a mitzva, <b>then just as doing good does not</b> involve <b>refraining from</b> performing <b>a mitzva,</b> but must involve performing a mitzva, e.g., an oath to eat <i>matza</i> on Passover, <b>so too, doing evil does not</b> involve <b>refraining from</b> performing <b>a mitzva,</b> e.g., an oath not to eat leavened bread on Passover. The result of this reasoning is that <b>doing evil</b> in the verse <b>is itself doing good,</b> in that it will always involve taking oaths to keep mitzvot.
<b>And</b> likewise, <b>doing good is juxtaposed to doing evil; just as doing evil does not</b> involve <b>performing a mitzva,</b> as it would then not be doing evil, <b>so too, doing good does not</b> involve <b>performing a mitzva. Doing good</b> in the verse <b>is itself doing evil,</b> in that it does not involve the fulfillment of mitzvot.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that doing evil and doing good are compared in this manner, <b>you do not find</b> that the verse can be interpreted <b>even with regard to optional matters,</b> as the same sort of contradiction could be generated.
<b>Rather,</b> one may derive that the verse is referring to optional matters <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it was necessary</b> for the verse to write <b>“or</b> to do good,” in order <b>to include</b> liability for oaths that involve <b>doing good to others. Conclude from it</b> that these <b>verses are written</b> referring <b>to optional matters. As, if it should enter your mind</b> that the <b>verses are written</b> referring <b>to matters</b> involving <b>a mitzva,</b> there is a difficulty: <b>Now</b> that <b>doing evil to others has been included,</b> i.e., when one takes an oath to refrain from performing a mitzva, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to mention <b>doing good to others?</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But this “or” is necessary</b> in order <b>to separate</b> them, i.e., to indicate that one can be liable for either type of oath. Had the verse said: To do evil and to do good, one might assume that one is liable only for oaths that involve both. The Gemara answers: <b>A verse is unnecessary</b> in order <b>to separate,</b> as it is clear that either sort of oath is included.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to Rabbi Yonatan’s</b> opinion concerning the interpretation of conjunctions, <b>but according to Rabbi Yoshiya’s</b> opinion, <b>what can be said?</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: From the verse: <b>“A man who curses his father and his mother</b> shall die” (Leviticus 20:9), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is liable if he curses both <b>his father and his mother. From where</b> do I derive that if one curses <b>his father but not his mother,</b> or <b>his mother but not his father,</b> he is liable? The continuation of <b>the verse states: “His father and his mother he has cursed;</b> his blood is upon him.” In the first part of the verse, the word “curses” is in proximity to “his father,” and in the last part of the verse, “cursed” is in proximity to “his mother.” This teaches that the verse is referring to both a case where <b>he cursed</b> only <b>his father</b> and a case where <b>he cursed</b> only <b>his mother;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> Rabbi Yoshiya maintains that conjunctions are interpreted strictly unless the verse indicates otherwise.
<b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> There is no need for this derivation, because the phrase “his father and his mother” <b>indicates</b> that one is liable if he curses <b>both of them together, and it</b> also <b>indicates</b> that he is liable if he curses either <b>one</b> of them <b>on their own,</b>

Daf 27b

<b>unless the verse specifies</b> that one is liable only if he curses both <b>together.</b> An example of a verse where the Torah specifies that the <i>halakha</i> applies only to the two elements in conjunction is: “You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together” (Deuteronomy 22:10).
The Gemara continues: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the verse is referring to optional matters according to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoshiya.</b> He <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who interprets</b> the Torah using the hermeneutical principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions</b> (see 26a), <b>and</b> the word <b>“or” is superfluous</b> and is used <b>to separate</b> “to do evil” from “to do good.”
The Gemara explains how one derives that the oaths referred to in the verse are oaths about optional matters in accordance with Rabbi Yoshiya, who interprets the verse in accordance with the principle of amplifications and restrictions: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the verse about an oath on an utterance <b>is written with regard to optional matters,</b> the words “to do evil, or to do good” serve to <b>restrict</b> the meaning of the verse and exclude the application of an oath on an utterance to <b>a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva.</b> The Gemara asks rhetorically: <b>But if you say</b> that the verse <b>is written</b> referring <b>to a matter</b> involving <b>a mitzva, what</b> do the words “to do evil, or to do good” serve to <b>restrict?</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira said: What? If,</b> with regard to an oath concerning <b>an optional</b> matter, for which one is not under oath from Mount Sinai, he is liable for breaking it, then with regard to an oath about a mitzva, for which he is under oath from Mount Sinai, is it not logical that he would be liable for breaking it? The Rabbis then asked him why he thinks one should be liable for an oath about a mitzva, since one would be exempt if it were inverted from positive to negative, rendering it an oath to refrain from performing a mitzva, which does not take effect. The Gemara comments: <b>The Rabbis’</b> objection <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira is well stated.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira</b> could <b>say to you: Isn’t</b> there the case of an oath involving <b>doing good to others, even though it does not include</b> the possibility of being inverted to include liability for an oath concerning <b>harming others, but</b> nevertheless <b>the Merciful One has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include it? <b>Here also, with regard to</b> an oath to <b>perform a mitzva, even though</b> it <b>does not</b> include the possibility of being inverted to include liability for an oath concerning <b>refraining from</b> performing <b>a mitzva, the Merciful One has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include it.
<b>And</b> how could <b>the Rabbis</b> respond? They could say that <b>there,</b> with regard to an oath to do good to others, <b>there is</b> the possibility of inverting the oath to: <b>I will not do good. Here,</b> with regard to an oath to perform a mitzva, <b>is there</b> any possibility of a valid oath: <b>I will not perform</b> a mitzva?
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat this loaf,</b> and he then says again: On my <b>oath I will not eat it,</b> and again: On my <b>oath I will not eat it, and he</b> then <b>ate it, he is liable only once.</b> Once the first oath had taken effect, the subsequent oaths could not, as a prohibition cannot take effect where another prohibition is already in place.
<b>This is an oath on an utterance, for which</b> one is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>lashes for intentionally</b> breaking <b>it, and for unwittingly</b> breaking <b>it</b> one is liable to bring <b>a sliding-scale offering.</b>
For <b>an oath</b> taken <b>in vain,</b> one is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>lashes when</b> it is taken <b>intentionally, and</b> one is <b>exempt when</b> it is taken <b>unwittingly.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>to teach</b> the mishna such that the wording of the first oath is: On my <b>oath I will not eat</b> this loaf, and then the wording of the second oath is: On my <b>oath I will not eat it?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us</b> that <b>the reason that he is liable only once</b> is <b>that he said: I will not eat</b> this loaf, <b>and then said: I will not eat it. But</b> if he had <b>said: I will not eat it, and then had said: I will not eat</b> this loaf, <b>he would be liable twice.</b>
This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava, as Rava says:</b> If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat this loaf, once he has eaten an olive-bulk of it</b> he is <b>liable,</b> as this oath is understood to mean that it is prohibited for him to eat any of the loaf. If he says: On my oath <b>I will not eat it, he is not liable unless he eats the whole</b> loaf. The words: I will not eat it, indicate that his oath applies only to eating the entire loaf. Accordingly, when the first oath is: I will not eat it, and the second oath is: I will not eat this loaf, the second oath can take effect, as it generates a new prohibition that applies to each and every olive-bulk of the loaf.
§ The mishna teaches: If one says: On my oath I will not eat this loaf, and he then says again: On my oath I will not eat it, and again: On my <b>oath I will not eat it, and he</b> then <b>ate it, he is liable only once.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna to mention <b>this additional,</b> third, oath: I will not eat it?
The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us</b> that <b>there is no liability</b> where one states redundant oaths, <b>but there is an oath;</b> the final oath is not completely discounted, so <b>that if you find room,</b> i.e., an application, for the additional oath, <b>it goes into effect.</b>
<b>For what</b> matter is this <b><i>halakha</i></b> relevant? It is relevant <b>for</b> the statement <b>of Rava, as Rava says that if one requested of</b> a halakhic authority <b>to</b> dissolve <b>the first oath,</b> and he did so, <b>the second one counts for him in its place</b> unless it, too, was dissolved.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports his</b> opinion: With regard to <b>one who took two vows of naziriteship, and counted the first</b> term of naziriteship and <b>separated an offering for it, and afterward requested</b> and received dissolution <b>of the first</b> vow from a halakhic authority, <b>the second</b> term <b>was counted for him in</b> the observance of <b>the first</b> term, and he is not required to be a nazirite further. This indicates that the second vow went into effect retroactively once the first was dissolved, and the same would be true in the case of two oaths.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> the second <b>naziriteship is there in any event, as once he counts the first</b> term, <b>he needs to return</b> and <b>count the second</b> if there is <b>no request</b> for dissolution. <b>Here,</b> if he does not request dissolution of the first oath, <b>is there a second oath at all?</b> Therefore one cannot find support for Rava’s opinion from the <i>baraita</i>.
§ <b>Rava says:</b> If one <b>took an oath about a loaf and</b> then <b>ate it, if</b> he <b>left an olive-bulk of it,</b> he <b>may request</b> that his oath <b>about</b> the loaf be dissolved. If <b>he ate the whole</b> loaf, <b>he may no longer request</b> that his oath <b>about it</b> be dissolved.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: What are the circumstances? If</b> one took an oath <b>where he said: I will not eat</b> this loaf, which Rava, as cited above, understands as rendering it prohibited for him to eat any part of the loaf, then <b>with the first olive-bulk</b> that he ate <b>he</b> already <b>committed his transgression. If</b> he took an oath <b>where he said: I will not eat it,</b> which Rava understands as rendering it prohibited for him to eat only the whole loaf, <b>why</b> does Rava mention <b>specifically</b> that he left over an <b>olive-bulk?</b>

Daf 28a

<b>Even</b> if he had left <b>any amount</b> it would <b>also</b> be possible for him to dissolve the oath, as he had not yet broken his oath.
Rav Ashi answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> stated by Rava is referring to a case where he took an oath, saying: <b>I will not eat</b> this loaf, and <b>if you wish, say</b> that it is referring to a case where he took an oath , saying: <b>I will not eat it.</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> stated by Rava is referring to a case where he took an oath , saying: <b>I will not eat</b> this loaf. <b>Since a request</b> for dissolution <b>is</b> still <b>effective</b> even <b>for the last olive-bulk</b> of the loaf, <b>it is effective also for the first olive-bulk.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> stated by Rava is referring to a case where he took an oath, saying: <b>I will not eat it. If he left an olive-bulk,</b> that is a sufficiently <b>significant</b> quantity <b>for which to request</b> dissolution of the oath. <b>But if</b> he did <b>not</b> leave that much, it is <b>not</b> a sufficiently <b>significant</b> quantity <b>for which to request</b> dissolution of the oath.
Rava assumes that once one has eaten the entire loaf, it is no longer possible to dissolve the oath. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who took two vows of naziriteship, and counted the first</b> term and <b>separated an offering for it, and afterward requested</b> and received dissolution <b>of the first</b> vow from a halakhic authority, <b>the second</b> term <b>was counted for him in</b> the observance of <b>the first</b> term and he is not required to be a nazirite further. Although the first term of naziriteship was entirely finished, a halakhic authority could still dissolve the vow.
The Gemara answers: <b>What are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he has not</b> yet <b>atoned,</b> i.e., he has not yet brought the offerings that one brings at the conclusion of naziriteship.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that one can still dissolve his vow of naziriteship after <b>he has atoned?</b> The Gemara answers: It is a case <b>where he</b> has brought the offerings but <b>has not</b> yet <b>shaved</b> his hair, <b>and</b> this is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says: Shaving is indispensable</b> to the completion of naziriteship.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that one can still dissolve his vow of naziriteship after <b>he has shaved? Rav Ashi said: Are you comparing naziriteship</b> to oaths? <b>What caused the second</b> naziriteship <b>to not take effect</b> until now? It was <b>the first</b> naziriteship, <b>and</b> once it has been dissolved, <b>it is no</b> longer a factor. Since the observance of the naziriteship term is the same whether it is counted for the second or the first, the first term of naziriteship can be regarded as not yet having started and that is why it can be dissolved. By contrast, in the case of the oath, once he ate the loaf, his oath is no longer extant at all.
<b>Ameimar said,</b> in contrast to the opinion of Rava: <b>Even</b> if <b>he ate the entire</b> loaf <b>he may still request</b> dissolution of the oath. <b>If</b> he ate it <b>unwittingly,</b> i.e., he forgot the oath, it is a situation where he <b>has not yet</b> brought the <b>offering</b> he is liable to bring. <b>If</b> he ate it <b>intentionally,</b> it is a situation where he <b>has not yet</b> received <b>lashes. But if he was</b> already <b>tied to the stake</b> in order to receive lashes, he can <b>no</b> longer request that his oath be dissolved, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel. As Shmuel says:</b> If one <b>had</b> already <b>been tied to the stake</b> in order to receive lashes, <b>and</b> he <b>ran</b> away <b>from the court</b> and escaped, he is <b>exempt</b> from receiving lashes, as being tied to the stake is regarded as the beginning of receiving the lashes; once he has escaped, he is treated as though he were already flogged.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so.</b> Even if he was tied to the stake he can still have his oath dissolved. <b>There,</b> with regard to his exemption from receiving lashes after <b>he ran</b> away, the original flogging is over and there is no need to initiate a new one. <b>Here,</b> with regard to dissolving the oath, <b>he did not run,</b> and since he is still subject to lashes, he can still have his oath dissolved.
§ <b>Rava says:</b> If one says: On my <b>oath I will not eat that loaf if I eat this one, and</b> then <b>he ate the first</b> one, i.e., the loaf whose consumption was the condition for the oath taking effect, <b>unwittingly, and</b> ate <b>the second intentionally,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> Since he fulfilled the condition unintentionally, the oath does not take effect, as it was without full intent. But if he ate the <b>first intentionally,</b> knowing that if he eats it it will be prohibited for him to eat the other loaf, <b>and</b> he then ate the <b>second unwittingly,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring an offering for breaking his oath unwittingly. If he ate them <b>both unwittingly</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> as the oath does not take effect when he fulfills the condition unwittingly.

Daf 28b

In a case where he ate <b>both of them intentionally,</b> if he <b>ate</b> the loaf whose consumption was <b>his condition and then ate the forbidden</b> loaf, <b>he is liable</b> to receive lashes. If he <b>ate the forbidden</b> loaf <b>and then ate</b> the loaf whose consumption was <b>his condition,</b> his liability is the subject of <b>a dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish. According to the one who says that an uncertain forewarning is deemed</b> a valid <b>forewarning,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to receive lashes. <b>According to the one who says</b> that an uncertain forewarning <b>is not deemed</b> a valid <b>forewarning,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> Since when he was forewarned for eating the forbidden loaf it was uncertain whether it would actually become forbidden, that forewarning is not sufficient for him to be liable to receive lashes.
If one took an oath with regard to two loaves such that he <b>rendered them interdependent, this</b> one <b>on that</b> one, saying: <b>I will not eat that if I eat this,</b> and: <b>I will not eat this if I eat that, and he ate this one intentionally</b> with regard to <b>itself,</b> i.e., at the time he ate it he was aware that he had taken an oath that would render it forbidden if he ate the other, <b>but unwittingly</b> with regard to <b>the other,</b> i.e., he did not remember that in eating it he rendered the second one forbidden, <b>and</b> then he ate <b>that one intentionally</b> with regard to <b>itself but unwittingly</b> with regard to <b>the other,</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> as both conditions were fulfilled only unintentionally.
If he ate <b>this</b> one <b>unwittingly</b> with regard to <b>itself,</b> having forgotten that it would be forbidden if he ate the other, <b>but intentionally</b> with regard to <b>the other,</b> understanding that with his action he rendered the other forbidden, <b>and that</b> one <b>unwittingly</b> with regard to <b>itself but intentionally</b> with regard to <b>the other,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to bring offerings for unwittingly breaking his oaths, as the conditions were fulfilled intentionally and the oaths took effect.
If he ate <b>both of them unwittingly</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> as both conditions were fulfilled only unintentionally.
If he ate <b>both of them intentionally, he is liable</b> to receive lashes <b>for</b> eating <b>the second</b> loaf, while <b>for the first</b> loaf his status depends on the <b>dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish</b> with regard to an uncertain forewarning.
<b>Rav Mari said: We learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 20b) <b>as well</b> that if one takes an oath with a condition but then fulfills the condition only unwittingly, he is exempt: <b>The Sages dissolved four</b> types of <b>vows</b> without the requirement of a request to a halakhic authority: <b>Vows of exhortation, vows of exaggeration, unwitting vows, and vows</b> whose fulfillment is impeded by <b>circumstances beyond</b> one’s <b>control.</b>
The mishna elaborates (see <i>Nedarim</i> 25b): <b>Unwitting vows, how so?</b> If one says: A certain item is <b>forbidden</b> to me <b>like an offering [<i>konam</i>] if I ate or if I drank, and</b> he then <b>remembers that he ate or drank,</b> or if one says: This loaf is <i>konam</i> for me if <b>I</b> will <b>eat or</b> if <b>I</b> will <b>drink, and he</b> then <b>forgets and eats or drinks,</b> the item <b>is permitted. And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> that mishna: <b>Just as unwitting vows are dissolved, so are unwitting oaths dissolved,</b> since he fulfilled the condition while lacking awareness that he was doing so.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>unwitting oaths? Is it not a case like this,</b> where he takes an oath with a condition and then fulfills the condition of the oath unwittingly? <b>Conclude from</b> that mishna that there is support for Rava’s opinion.
§ It is related that the Sage <b>Eifa learned</b> tractate <b><i>Shevuot</i> in the academy of Rabba. His brother Avimi met him</b> and tested him concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of oaths. Avimi <b>said to him:</b> If one says: On my <b>oath I did not eat,</b> and then again: On my <b>oath I did not eat, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Eifa <b>said to him: He is liable only once</b> if he ate. Avimi <b>said to him: You have confused</b> the issue. Since the oaths are about the past, it is not a question of whether the second oath takes effect. Each time, <b>a false oath was issued,</b> and each was a separate transgression.
Avimi asked him further: If one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat nine</b> pieces <b>and</b> on my oath I will not eat <b>ten, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Eifa replied: <b>He is liable for each and every one</b> of the oaths, as the scope of the second oath is broader than that of the first. Avimi <b>said to him: You have confused</b> the issue: <b>If he may not eat nine, he may not eat ten.</b> The oath not to eat ten cannot take effect, since it is an action already prohibited by the oath not to eat nine.
Avimi asked him further: If one said: On my <b>oath I will not eat ten and</b> on my oath I will not eat <b>nine, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Eifa replied: <b>He is liable</b> for <b>only one</b> oath. Avimi <b>said to him: You have confused</b> the issue. According to the first oath, it <b>is ten that he may not eat, but he may still eat nine,</b> so the second oath takes effect, in that it prohibits him from eating nine.
<b>Abaye said:</b> There are <b>times when you find that</b> the ruling <b>of Eifa</b> with regard to an oath not to eat ten followed by an oath not to eat nine applies, <b>as</b> in the case mentioned by <b>the Master. As Rabba says:</b> In the case of one who says: On my <b>oath I will not eat figs and grapes</b> together, <b>and then says:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat figs,</b>

Daf 29a

<b>and he</b> unwittingly <b>ate figs and set aside an offering</b> for breaking the second oath, <b>and afterward he</b> unwittingly <b>ate grapes alone,</b> he is exempt from liability for breaking the first oath. <b>The grapes are</b> tantamount to <b>a half-measure</b> of his first oath, which was not to eat figs and grapes together, <b>and one is not liable</b> to bring <b>an offering for a half-measure. Here also, where he said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat ten, and then said:</b> On my <b>oath I will not eat nine, and he ate nine and set aside an offering</b> for breaking his second oath, <b>and later he ate</b> the <b>tenth,</b> this <b>tenth is</b> tantamount to <b>a half-measure</b> of his first oath, <b>and one is not liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for a half-measure.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Which</b> oath <b>is an oath</b> taken <b>in vain,</b> mentioned in the previous mishna (27b)? It is when one <b>takes an oath to deny that which is known to people</b> to be true, for example, one <b>says about a stone column that it is</b> made <b>of gold, or about a man that he is a woman, or about a woman that she is a man.</b>
Another type of oath taken in vain is when one <b>takes an oath about a matter that is impossible,</b> e.g., if he says: <b>If I did not see a camel flying through the air, or: If I did not see a snake</b> as large <b>as the beam of the olive press.</b>
In the case of one who <b>said to witnesses: Come and testify for me,</b> and they replied: On our <b>oath we will not testify for you,</b> that is an oath taken in vain, because it involves <b>taking an oath to refrain from</b> performing <b>a mitzva.</b> Other examples of this include an oath <b>not to build a <i>sukka</i>, or not to take a <i>lulav</i>, or not to don phylacteries. This</b> type of oath <b>is an oath taken in vain, for</b> which one is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>lashes</b> if he takes the oath <b>intentionally, and for</b> which he is <b>exempt</b> if he takes it <b>unwittingly.</b>
If one said: On my <b>oath I will eat this loaf,</b> and later said: On my <b>oath I will not eat it, the first</b> oath is <b>an oath on an utterance, and the second</b> is <b>an oath</b> taken <b>in vain,</b> as he took an oath to perform an action that would violate his previous oath.
If <b>he ate it, he violated</b> the prohibition against taking <b>an oath in vain.</b> If <b>he did not eat it, he violated</b> the prohibition against breaking <b>an oath on an utterance.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to an oath taken in vain that denies that which is known to people, <b>Ulla says:</b> It is considered known to people when <b>it is</b> a fact <b>that is known to three people.</b>
§ The mishna describes an oath taken in vain where one <b>takes an oath about a matter that is impossible,</b> e.g., where one says: <b>If I did not see a camel flying through the air.</b> The Gemara points out: The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>did not say:</b> On my <b>oath I saw. What</b> is the meaning of: <b>If I did not see? Abaye said:</b> Emend the language of the mishna and <b>teach:</b> On my <b>oath I saw. Rava said:</b> This is part of a larger statement <b>where one says: Let all the produce in the world be prohibited for me if I did not see a camel flying through the air.</b>
With regard to the oath: If I did not see a camel flying through the air, <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Perhaps this man</b> who took this oath <b>saw a great bird and named it</b> for himself: <b>Camel, and when he took the oath, he took the oath according to his own understanding.</b>
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>we follow his mouth,</b> i.e., the generally accepted meaning of what one says, <b>and we do not follow his understanding,</b> i.e., his own private meaning, <b>but isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When they administer an oath to him</b> in court, the judges <b>say to him: Know that</b> it is <b>not according to your</b> own <b>understanding</b> that <b>we administer</b> this <b>oath to you, but according to our understanding and according to the understanding of the court? What is the reason</b> they say this? <b>Is it not because we say: Perhaps he gave tokens [<i>iskunderei</i>]</b> to his creditor <b>but he calls them</b> for himself: <b>Dinars,</b> so <b>that when he takes the oath, it is according to his own understanding that he takes the oath.</b> Since, in principle, it is possible for him to take an oath according to his private meaning of the words, the court insists that the oath it administers is to be understood according to the words’ generally accepted meaning.
Rav Ashi replies: <b>No,</b> the reason the court admonishes the oath taker is not that the oath can be interpreted according to a private meaning. <b>There,</b> when the court administers an oath, they explain that it is according to their meaning <b>due to</b> deceptions like that of <b>the reed</b> in <b>Rava’s</b> court. In that incident, someone handed his creditor a hollow reed, which he had secretly filled with coins, to hold for him, and proceeded to take an oath that he had given him the money owed to him, whereupon he took back the reed, as the creditor was unaware of its contents. The court admonishes oath takers so that they do not think that they have fulfilled their obligation to take an oath if they engage in such chicanery.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And so we found</b> that <b>when Moses administered an oath to Israel</b> that they would keep the Torah (see Deuteronomy 29:9–12), <b>he said to them: Know that I am not administering this oath according to your understanding but according to the understanding of the Omnipresent and according to my understanding. And why</b> not <b>let him</b> simply <b>say to them: Keep that which God said? Is it not</b> that he insisted on admonishing them <b>because</b> he was concerned lest <b>they direct</b> the oath <b>in their minds</b> to <b>idolatry,</b> saying that they are taking an oath of loyalty to God but privately intending the oath to be for idolatry? This indicates that the content of an oath can be affected by an oath taker’s private meaning.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> Moses explicitly indicated that the oath was according to God’s and his own understanding <b>because idolatry is also referred to</b> with the word: <b>God, as it is written:</b> “You shall not make with Me <b>gods of silver or gods of gold”</b> (Exodus 20:20). Therefore, the generally accepted meaning of the oath is ambiguous.
The Gemara suggests: If private meanings do not affect the content of an oath, <b>let Moses</b> merely <b>say to them: Keep the Torah.</b> The Gemara explains: They could then have taken an oath to keep only <b>one Torah,</b> either the Written or the Oral Torah. The Gemara suggests: <b>And let him say: Keep two Torahs.</b> The Gemara explains: The word: Torah, also has a narrower meaning of a set of halakhic procedures. The Jewish people could then have limited the oath to <b>the law of [<i>torat</i>] the sin-offering</b> or <b>the law of [<i>torat</i>] the guilt-offering.</b> The Gemara suggests: Let Moses administer an oath to <b>keep the entire Torah.</b> The Gemara replies: That could have been understood as referring only to the prohibition of <b>idolatry, as the Master says:</b> The prohibition of <b>idolatry is</b> so <b>severe that</b> with regard to <b>one who denies</b> idol worship, <b>it is as if he affirms the entire Torah.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let him say to them: Keep</b> the <b>mitzva,</b> i.e., that which you are commanded. The Gemara replies: That could have been understood as referring to only <b>one mitzva.</b> The Gemara suggests: Let him say: <b>Keep mitzvot,</b> i.e., in the plural. The Gemara replies: That could be understood as referring to only <b>two</b> mitzvot. The Gemara suggests: Let him say: <b>All the mitzvot in their entirety.</b> The Gemara replies: That could be understood as referring to <b>the mitzva of ritual fringes, as the Master says: The mitzva of ritual fringes is equivalent to all the</b> other <b>mitzvot.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let him say to them: Keep 613 mitzvot.</b> The Gemara replies: <b>And according to your reasoning, let him</b> simply <b>say:</b> Take the oath <b>according to my understanding. Why do I</b> need for him to say: <b>According to the understanding of the Omnipresent?</b>

Daf 29b

<b>Rather,</b> Moses administered the oath in this manner <b>so that there would not be</b> any possibility of the <b>nullification of their oath.</b> An oath taken with public consent cannot be dissolved. In this case, Moses and God constitute the public that gives its consent to the oath administered to the people. This was the reason for Moses’ insistence that the oath was taken according to his and God’s awareness; it was not because there was a possibility that the people could take the oath according to a private meaning.
§ The mishna teaches with regard to an oath about a matter that is impossible, e.g., If I did not see a camel flying through the air, or: <b>If I did not see a snake</b> as large <b>as the beam of the olive press.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> are there <b>no</b> snakes that large? <b>But wasn’t there a certain</b> snake <b>during the years</b> of the reign <b>of King Shapur, one</b> snake <b>that</b> could <b>contain,</b> i.e., swallow, <b>thirteen stables of straw?</b>
<b>Shmuel said:</b> The size of the snake is not the subject of the analogy. The oath is referring <b>to</b> a snake that was <b>flat [<i>taruf</i> ]</b> like the beam of an olive press. The Gemara asks: <b>Aren’t they all flat?</b> The Gemara explains: Snakes’ undersides are flat. This oath is referring <b>to</b> a snake <b>whose back is flat.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If one said: On my <b>oath I will eat this loaf,</b> and later said: On my <b>oath I will not eat it,</b> the first oath is an oath on an utterance, and the second is an oath taken in vain. If he ate the loaf, he violated the prohibition against taking an oath in vain. If he did not eat it, he violated the prohibition against breaking an oath on an utterance. The Gemara asks: <b>Now,</b> if he did not eat it, <b>he is liable because</b> he violated his <b>oath on an utterance. Is he not</b> also <b>liable for an oath</b> taken <b>in vain? An oath was issued in vain</b> when he took the oath not to eat the loaf, as this required a violation of the oath he had taken to eat it.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: Teach</b> the mishna with this emendation: If he did not eat it, he <b>also</b> violated the prohibition <b>against</b> breaking <b>an oath on an utterance.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> As opposed to the <i>halakhot</i> of an oath of testimony, which will be discussed in the following chapter, the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>an oath on an utterance apply to men and to women, to relatives and to non-relatives, to those who are fit</b> to testify <b>and to those who are disqualified,</b> whether the oath is taken <b>in the presence of a court or not in the presence of a court,</b> i.e., when one takes an oath <b>on his own,</b> at his own initiative. <b>And for</b> violating an oath <b>intentionally</b> one is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>lashes, and for</b> doing so <b>unwittingly</b> he is liable to bring <b>a sliding-scale offering.</b>
Liability for <b>an oath</b> taken <b>in vain applies to men and to women, to relatives and to non-relatives, to those who are fit</b> to bear witness <b>and to those who are disqualified,</b> whether the oath is taken <b>in the presence of a court or not in the presence of a court, and</b> also when one takes an oath <b>on his own. And for</b> violating an oath <b>intentionally</b> one is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>lashes, and for</b> doing so <b>unwittingly</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
With regard to <b>both this,</b> an oath on an utterance, <b>and that,</b> an oath taken in vain, even if <b>he is administered the oath by others,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> For example, if one said: <b>If I did not eat today, or: I did not don phylacteries today,</b> and another said to him: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> that your statement is true, <b>and</b> the former <b>said: Amen,</b> he is <b>liable</b> if the statement was false.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Shmuel says: Anyone who answers amen after</b> being administered <b>an oath is like one who expresses an oath with his</b> own <b>mouth, as it is written</b> in the context of the oath administered to a <i>sota</i>, a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful: <b>“And the woman shall say: Amen, amen”</b> (Numbers 5:22).
<b>Rav Pappa said in the name of Rava:</b> An inference from <b>the mishna and a <i>baraita</i> also</b> support this when they are read <b>precisely, as it is taught</b> in the mishna (30a): <b>The oath of testimony is practiced with regard to men but not with regard to women; with regard to non-relatives</b> of the litigants, <b>but not with regard to relatives; with regard to</b> those <b>fit</b> to testify <b>but not with regard to</b> those <b>unfit</b> to testify due to a transgression that they performed. <b>And</b> the oath of testimony <b>is practiced only with regard to</b> those <b>fit to testify. And</b> this oath applies both <b>in the presence of a court and not in the presence of a court,</b> i.e., when the witness takes the oath <b>on his own</b> that he has no knowledge of the matter. <b>But</b> if an oath is administered to the witnesses <b>by others, they are not liable until they deny</b> knowledge of the matter <b>in court</b> and take an oath to that effect; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
Before stating the inference from the mishna, Rav Pappa cites the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And</b> it <b>is taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> With regard to <b>an oath of testimony, how</b> is one liable to bring a sliding-scale offering? A person <b>said to witnesses: Come and testify for me.</b> They replied: On our <b>oath we do not know any testimony that concerns you,</b> i.e., we have no knowledge of the matter. <b>Alternatively, they said: We do not know any testimony that concerns you,</b> and he said to them: <b>I administer an oath to you, and they said to him: Amen. Whether</b> this oath was taken <b>in the presence of a court</b> or <b>whether</b> it was <b>not in the presence of a court, whether</b> it was taken by each witness <b>by himself</b> or <b>whether</b> it was administered <b>by others, once they denied</b> knowing testimony that they in fact knew, they <b>are liable;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
Rav Pappa asks: Aren’t the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> <b>difficult,</b> as they contradict <b>each other?</b> According to the mishna one is liable when the oath is administered by others only if it takes place in the presence of a court, while according to the <i>baraita</i> one is liable even not in the presence of a court. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>this</b> statement in the <i>baraita</i>, where he is liable even not in the presence of a court, is referring to one <b>who answered amen</b> to the administered oath. <b>That</b> statement in the mishna is referring to one <b>who did not answer amen</b> and is therefore liable only in the presence of a court? The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that it is so.
<b>Ravina said in the name of Rava: The mishna that is here</b> (29b) <b>also</b> may be read <b>precisely</b> to support this point. <b>As it is taught</b> in the mishna: The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>an oath on an utterance apply to men and to women, to relatives and to non-relatives, to those who are fit</b> to testify <b>and to those who are disqualified,</b> whether the oath is taken <b>in the presence of a court or not in the presence of a court,</b> i.e., when one takes an oath <b>on his own,</b> at his own initiative. Ravina states his inference: On his own, <b>yes,</b> but administered <b>by others, no. And</b> it is <b>taught</b> in <b>the last clause</b> of the mishna: With regard to <b>this,</b> an oath on an utterance, <b>and that,</b> an oath taken in vain, even if <b>he is administered the oath by others,</b> he is <b>liable.</b>
These statements in the mishna are <b>difficult,</b> as they contradict <b>each other. Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from it</b> that <b>this</b> latter clause of the mishna is referring to one <b>who answered amen</b> to the administered oath. <b>That</b> former clause is referring to one <b>who did not answer amen</b> and is therefore liable only in the presence of a court.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> since his statement can be derived from tannaitic sources, <b>what is Shmuel teaching us?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He is teaching us the precise</b> reading <b>of the mishna.</b> Since that <i>halakha</i> is not stated explicitly in the mishna, Shmuel saw fit to state it.

Daf 30a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The oath of testimony is practiced with regard to men but not with regard to women, with regard to non-relatives</b> of the litigants <b>but not with regard to relatives, with regard to</b> those <b>fit</b> to testify <b>but not with regard to</b> those <b>unfit</b> to testify due to a transgression that they performed. <b>And</b> the oath of testimony <b>is practiced only with regard to</b> those <b>fit to testify.</b>
The oath of testimony is practiced both <b>in the presence of a court and not in the presence of a court,</b> when the potential witness takes the oath <b>on his own. But</b> if the oath is administered <b>by others</b> and those denying that they witnessed the incident in question neither take an oath nor answer amen to the administered oath, <b>they are not liable until they deny</b> any knowledge of the incident in question <b>in court.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: Whether</b> one of the witnesses takes the oath <b>on his own or whether</b> the oath is administered <b>by others,</b> the witnesses <b>are not liable until they deny</b> any knowledge of the incident in question before the litigants <b>in court.</b>
<b>And one is liable for</b> the act of taking a false <b>oath with intent and for an unwitting</b> act of taking a false oath, i.e., he is unaware of the liability for taking a false oath, provided that he takes the oath <b>with intent</b> in terms of <b>the testimony,</b> i.e., he takes an oath that he has no knowledge of the matter even though he knows that he witnessed the incident. <b>But</b> witnesses <b>are not liable for</b> taking the oath if they were <b>unwitting</b> in terms of the testimony, i.e., they believe that they have no knowledge of the matter. <b>And what are they liable for</b> by taking a false <b>oath with intent?</b> They are liable to bring <b>a sliding-scale offering.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that the oath of testimony is not practiced with regard to women because they are unfit to testify. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter,</b> that women do not testify, derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: “If an unrighteous witness rises up against any man…<b>then the two men shall stand”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:16–17), it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that <b>the verse is speaking.</b> Apparently, men, not women, may testify.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>with regard to witnesses, or</b> perhaps it is <b>only with regard to litigants</b> that the verse is speaking? <b>When it states: “Between whom the controversy is”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:17), <b>the litigants are</b> already <b>stated</b> in the verse. <b>How do I realize</b> the meaning of the phrase <b>“then the two men shall stand”?</b> Apparently, it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that <b>the verse is speaking. And if it is your wish to say</b> that this is not a proof, another proof may be cited. <b>It is stated here:</b> “The <b>two</b> men,” <b>and it is stated there:</b> “On the basis of <b>two</b> witnesses” (Deuteronomy 19:15); <b>just as there,</b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks, <b>so too here,</b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the statement of the <i>baraita</i>: And <b>if it is your wish to say?</b> Why is the initial proof inadequate? The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the verse <b>did not write:</b> Then the two men <b>and those between whom the controversy is</b> shall stand, which would indicate that the verse changes its focus from the witnesses to the litigants, perhaps throughout <b>the entire verse</b> it is <b>with regard to litigants</b> that <b>it is speaking.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> cites an additional proof. <b>It is stated here:</b> “The <b>two</b> men,” <b>and it is stated there:</b> “On the basis of <b>two</b> witnesses”; <b>just as there,</b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks, <b>so too here,</b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“Then the two men shall stand,”</b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that <b>the verse is speaking.</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>with regard to witnesses, or</b> perhaps it is <b>only with regard to litigants</b> that the verse is speaking? The <i>tanna</i> asks: Did <b>you say</b> that? If the reference is to litigants, why does the verse mention two? <b>Do two</b> people <b>come</b> to court <b>for judgment</b> but <b>three</b> people <b>do not come</b> to court <b>for judgment? And if it is your wish to say</b> that this is not a proof, another proof may be cited. <b>It is stated here:</b> “The <b>two</b> men,” <b>and it is stated there:</b> “On the basis of <b>two</b> witnesses”; <b>just as there,</b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks, <b>so too here,</b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: And <b>if it is your wish to say?</b> Why is the initial proof inadequate? The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say</b> that even though there are cases where there are more than two litigants, it is <b>with regard to a plaintiff and a defendant</b> that <b>the verse is speaking.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> cites an additional proof. <b>It is stated here:</b> “The <b>two</b> men,” <b>and it is stated there:</b> “On the basis of <b>two</b> witnesses”; <b>just as there,</b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks, <b>so too here,</b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“Then the two men shall stand,”</b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that <b>the verse is speaking.</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Do you say</b> that it is <b>with regard to witnesses, or</b> perhaps it is <b>only with regard to litigants</b> that the verse is speaking? The <i>tanna</i> asks: Did <b>you say</b> that? If the reference is to litigants, why does the verse mention men? Do <b>men come</b> to court <b>for judgment</b> but <b>women do not come</b> to court <b>for judgment? And if it is your wish to say</b> that this is not a proof, another proof may be cited. <b>It is stated here:</b> “The <b>two</b> men,” <b>and it is stated there:</b> “On the basis of <b>two</b> witnesses”; <b>just as there,</b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks, <b>so too here,</b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: And <b>if it is your wish to say?</b> Why is the initial proof inadequate? The Gemara answers that it means: <b>And if you would say</b> that with regard to <b>a woman, it is not</b> typical <b>conduct</b> for <b>her</b> to appear in court <b>due to</b> the verse that is stated with regard to women: <b>“All the glory of the king’s daughter is within”</b> (Psalms 45:14), and that is why the verse addressed a situation that is prevalent, i.e., a case where the litigants are men, and there is no proof that women are unfit for testimony. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> cites an additional proof. <b>It is stated here:</b> “The <b>two</b> men,” <b>and it is stated there:</b> “On the basis of <b>two</b> witnesses”; <b>just as there,</b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks, <b>so too here,</b> it is <b>with regard to witnesses</b> that the verse speaks.
§ The Gemara cites another interpretation of the verse. <b>The Sages taught: “Then the two men shall stand”;</b> this indicates that there is <b>a mitzva for the litigants to stand</b> during the court proceedings. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: I heard that if</b> the judges <b>wished to seat both</b> of the litigants, <b>they may seat</b> them. <b>What,</b> then, <b>is prohibited</b> for the judges? They must ensure <b>that there will not be</b> a situation where <b>one</b> litigant <b>is standing and one</b> litigant <b>is sitting,</b> or a situation where <b>one</b> litigant <b>says everything</b> that <b>he needs</b> to say to present his case <b>and one</b> litigant, the judge <b>says to him: Curtail your statement.</b>
<b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“But in righteousness shall you judge your colleague”</b> (Leviticus 19:15), from which it is derived: The court must ensure <b>that there will not be</b> a situation where <b>one</b> litigant <b>is sitting and one</b> litigant <b>is standing,</b> or a situation where <b>one</b> litigant <b>says everything</b> that <b>he needs</b> to say to present his case <b>and one</b> litigant, the judge <b>says to him: Curtail your statement. Alternatively,</b> it is derived from the verse: <b>“But in righteousness shall you judge your colleague,”</b> that you <b>should judge another favorably,</b> and seek to find justification for his actions, even if when interpreted differently his actions could be judged unfavorably.
<b>Rav Yosef teaches</b> that from the verse: <b>“But in righteousness shall you judge your colleague [<i>amitekha</i>],”</b> it is derived: <b>With</b> regard to one <b>who is with you [<i>im she’itekha</i>] in</b> observance of <b>Torah and in</b> fulfillment of <b>mitzvot, try to judge him favorably,</b> in the manner that the Gemara will now explain.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ulla, son of Rav Ilai, had a trial</b> pending <b>before Rav Naḥman. Rav Yosef sent</b> a message <b>to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>Ulla our friend</b> is <b>a colleague in Torah and mitzvot,</b> with regard to whom the verse states that you should judge him favorably. Rav Naḥman <b>said: For what</b> purpose <b>did he send</b> this message <b>to me?</b> Does he expect me <b>to grant him preferential</b> treatment? Every judgment must be undertaken with righteousness. Rav Naḥman <b>then said:</b> Rav Yosef sent me the message <b>to</b> ensure I would <b>open with</b> Rav Ulla’s <b>dispute</b> in the event that other cases come before me for judgment, in deference to the Torah because he is a Torah scholar.

Daf 30b

<b>Alternatively,</b> Rav Yosef informed me that Rav Ulla is a Torah scholar <b>with regard to</b> circumstances where the ruling is not clear-cut and the decision is rendered based on <b>the discretion of the judges,</b> that is, when the court is unable to rule solely based on the testimony presented in court and the judges arrive at their ruling based on their sense of the matter. Rav Yosef informed Rav Naḥman that if the case is decided based on judicial discretion, Rav Ulla is worthy of having the decision ruled in his favor.
§ <b>Ulla says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda with regard to the obligation to stand in court is only <b>with regard to the litigants; but with regard to the witnesses, everyone agrees</b> that they testify <b>while standing, as it is written: “Then the two men shall stand”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:17). <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> whether the litigants are required to stand is only <b>at the time of the deliberation, but at the time of the verdict, everyone agrees</b> that the <b>judges</b> issue the verdict <b>while sitting and the litigants</b> receive the verdict <b>while standing, as it is written: “And Moses sat to judge the people and the people stood”</b> (Exodus 18:13).
The Gemara presents <b>an alternative version</b> of the statement of Rav Huna: The <b>dispute</b> whether the litigants are required to stand is only <b>at the time of the deliberation, but at the time of the verdict, everyone agrees</b> that the <b>judges</b> issue the verdict <b>while sitting and the litigants</b> receive the verdict <b>while standing, as</b> concerning the <b>witnesses,</b> the status of the stage of their testimony is <b>like</b> that of the stage of <b>the verdict, and it is written concerning them: “Then the two men shall stand.”</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>The wife of Rav Huna had a trial</b> pending <b>before Rav Naḥman.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said: What should we do? If I will arise before her</b> in deference to her status as the wife of a Torah scholar, <b>the claims of the</b> other <b>litigant</b> will be <b>suppressed,</b> as it will be mistaken as a display of preference for the wife of Rav Huna, since not everyone is aware that one is required to show deference to the wife of a Torah scholar. If <b>I will not arise before her,</b> that would run counter to the principle that in terms of deference, the status of the <b>wife of a <i>ḥaver</i> is like</b> that of <b>a <i>ḥaver</i>,</b> who is devoted to the meticulous observance of mitzvot. Rav Naḥman <b>said to his attendant: Go outside and cause a duck to fly and cast it onto me, and</b> in that way <b>I will</b> be forced to <b>arise</b> in a manner that will fulfill the obligation to rise, without intimidating the other litigant.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t the Master,</b> Rav Huna, <b>say:</b> The <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis whether the litigants are required to stand is only <b>at the time of the deliberation, but at the time of the verdict, everyone agrees</b> that the <b>judges</b> issue the verdict <b>while sitting and the litigants</b> receive the verdict <b>while standing?</b> How, then, can Rav Naḥman rise? The Gemara responds: One may fulfill both requirements in a case <b>where he sits like one who unties his shoe,</b> neither completely standing nor completely sitting, <b>and says</b> his verdict: <b>So-and-so, you are innocent,</b> and <b>so-and-so, you are guilty.</b>
§ <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says:</b> In <b>this</b> situation where <b>a Torah scholar [<i>letzurva merabbanan</i>] and an <i>am ha’aretz</i> have a court case with one another, we seat the Torah scholar, and to the <i>am ha’aretz</i> we also say: Sit. And if he</b> chooses to <b>stand</b> due to deference, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav bar Sherevya had a trial</b> pending <b>before Rav Pappa.</b> Rav Pappa <b>seated him and also seated his litigant</b> counterpart, who was an <i>am ha’aretz</i>. <b>An agent of the court came</b> and <b>kicked and stood the <i>am ha’aretz</i> on his feet</b> to show deference to the Torah scholars there, <b>and Rav Pappa did not say to him: Sit.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How did</b> Rav Pappa <b>act</b> in <b>that</b> manner by not instructing the <i>am ha’aretz</i> to sit again? <b>But aren’t</b> the <b>claims</b> of the <i>am ha’aretz</i> <b>suppressed</b> by Rav Pappa’s perceived preferential treatment of Rav bar Sherevya? The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Pappa said</b> to himself that the litigant will not perceive bias, as <b>he says:</b> The judge <b>seated me;</b> it <b>is the agent</b> of the court <b>who is displeased with me</b> and compelled me to stand.
<b>And Rabba bar Rav Huna says:</b> In <b>this</b> situation where <b>a Torah scholar and an <i>am ha’aretz</i> have a court case with one another, let the Torah scholar not</b> come to court <b>early and sit</b> with the judge in order to learn from him, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> by doing so <b>he appears as one who is</b> consulting the judge <b>to arrange his legal</b> claims, and that is prohibited. <b>And we said</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where there is not a fixed time for</b> the Torah scholar to study with the judge at that hour; <b>but</b> if <b>there is a fixed time for him</b> to study with the judge at that hour, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it,</b> as the other litigant <b>will say: He is occupied with his</b> fixed study <b>time,</b> and the fact that he sat before the judge is unrelated to the case.
§ <b>And Rabba bar Rav Huna says:</b> In the case of <b>a certain Torah scholar who knows testimony</b> relevant to a certain individual, <b>but</b> it is <b>a demeaning matter for him to go to the court</b> consisting <b>of a judge who is less</b> prominent <b>than he</b> in order <b>to testify before him, let him not go</b> and testify. <b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: We learn</b> that <i>halakha</i> in a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 29b) <b>as well:</b> If <b>one found a sack or a basket, and it is not his</b> typical <b>manner to take</b> it, <b>he</b> shall <b>not take</b> it in order to return it to its owner. Evidently, a Torah scholar may refrain from performing the mitzva to return a lost item (see Deuteronomy 22:1–3) if it is not in keeping with his stature.
The Gemara notes: <b>This matter</b> applies only <b>with regard to</b> cases involving <b>monetary matters; but in</b> cases involving <b>ritual matters,</b> the dignity of the Torah scholar is not a consideration, as it is written: <b>“There is neither wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the Lord”</b> (Proverbs 21:30), from which it is derived: <b>Wherever there is desecration of the name of the Lord, one does not show deference to the teacher.</b> Rather, the Torah scholar forgoes the honor due him in order to avoid violation of any prohibition that would desecrate the name of God.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yeimar knew testimony</b> relevant <b>to</b> the case of <b>Mar Zutra. He came before Ameimar,</b> who <b>seated all</b> the witnesses in deference to Rav Yeimar. <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: But doesn’t Ulla say</b> that the <b>dispute</b> between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda with regard to the obligation to stand in court is only <b>with regard to the litigants, but with regard to the witnesses, everyone agrees</b> that they testify <b>while standing?</b> Ameimar <b>said to him: This,</b> i.e., witnesses standing during testimony, is <b>a positive mitzva, and that,</b> i.e., treating Torah scholars with deference and allowing Rav Yeimar to sit, is <b>a positive mitzva, and the positive mitzva of deference to the Torah takes precedence.</b> Ameimar seated Rav Yeimar in deference to the Torah. In order to prevent a miscarriage of justice, he seated all the witnesses.
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the ensuing discussion: <b>Advocacy, ignoramus, robbery, fraud.</b>
<b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived that <b>a judge should not engage in advocacy [<i>saneigeron</i>] for his</b> own <b>statements</b> and devise various pretexts to justify his erroneous rulings? It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter”</b> (Exodus 23:7). <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to a judge that a student</b> who is <b>an ignoramus should not sit before him</b> to discuss the proceedings? It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter.”</b> When an ignorant student engages in the proceedings, he is apt to cause the judge to err in judgment.
<b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>a judge who knows that another</b> judge <b>is a robber</b> and is disqualified from serving as a judge; <b>and likewise, a witness who knows that another</b> witness <b>is a robber</b> and is disqualified from serving as a witness; <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that he should not join him</b> in judgment or testimony? It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter.”</b>
<b>From where</b> is it derived that in a case where <b>a judge who knows</b> that the witnesses testifying before him are lying even though he is unable to prove it through their cross-examination and <b>with regard to the verdict</b> the result will be <b>that it is fraudulent, that he should not say: Since the witnesses are testifying</b> and I cannot prove their deceit, <b>I will decide</b> the case based on their testimony, <b>and let</b>

Daf 31a

<b>the chain [<i>kolar</i>]</b> of culpability for the miscarriage of justice <b>be</b> placed <b>around the neck of the</b> false <b>witnesses?</b> It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter.”</b>
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for additional <i>halakhot</i> derived from the verse: “Distance yourself from a false matter.” <b>Three</b> relating to <b>a student; and three</b> relating to <b>creditors;</b> and three relating to a judge: <b>Rags, hears, and explain.</b>
<b>From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>a student who is sitting before his teacher and sees</b> a claim that provides <b>advantage for a poor</b> person <b>and disadvantage for a wealthy</b> person <b>that he shall not remain silent?</b> It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter.”</b>
<b>From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>a student who sees his teacher who is erring in judgment that he shall not say: I will wait for</b> my teacher <b>until he concludes</b> the trial <b>and</b> then <b>I will contradict him and construct</b> a ruling <b>of my own so that the verdict will be attributed to my name?</b> It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter.”</b>
<b>From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>a student whose teacher said to him: You know concerning me that</b> even <b>if</b> one were to <b>give me one hundred</b> times <b>one hundred dinars, I would not fabricate</b> a claim. Now, <b>I have one hundred dinars in the possession of so-and-so,</b> to whom I lent money, <b>but I have only one witness</b> of the two required to testify <b>about</b> the loan and enable me to collect payment; <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the student <b>shall not join with</b> the other witness and testify? It is derived <b>as the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter”</b> (Exodus 23:7).
The Gemara asks: Is it from the verse <b>“Distance yourself from a false matter” that this</b> matter <b>is derived? But</b> isn’t <b>he certainly lying</b> in that case, <b>and</b> this is already stated, as <b>the Merciful One states: “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor”</b> (Exodus 20:13)? <b>Rather,</b> the reference is to a case <b>where</b> the teacher <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>certain</b> that <b>I have one witness, and you come</b> and <b>stand there</b> beside him <b>and do not say anything, as</b> in that manner <b>you do not express a lie from your mouth.</b> Your silent presence will create the impression that I have two witnesses and lead the debtor to admit his debt. <b>Even so,</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to do this, <b>due to that</b> which <b>is stated: “Distance yourself from a false matter.”</b>
There are three <i>halakhot</i> with regard to a creditor: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>one who is seeking</b> repayment <b>from another</b> of a debt of <b>one hundred dinars,</b> and there are no witnesses to that effect, <b>that he shall not say: I will claim</b> that <b>he</b> owes me <b>two hundred</b> dinars <b>so that he will admit</b> that he owes <b>me one hundred dinars, and he will become liable</b> to take <b>an oath to me,</b> the oath of one who admits to part of a claim, <b>and</b> on that basis <b>I will extend</b> the oath and compel <b>him</b> to take <b>an oath</b> with regard to a debt that he owes me <b>from another place?</b> It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter.”</b>
<b>From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>one who is seeking</b> repayment <b>from another</b> of a debt of <b>one hundred dinars and claims</b> that the debtor owes <b>him two hundred</b> dinars, <b>that</b> the debtor <b>shall not say: I will</b> completely <b>deny his</b> claim <b>in court, and I will admit to him outside court so that I will not become liable</b> to take <b>an oath to him and he will not extend</b> the oath and compel <b>me</b> to take <b>an oath</b> with regard to a debt that I owe him <b>from another place?</b> It is derived <b>as the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter.”</b>
<b>From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>three who are seeking</b> repayment <b>from one</b> individual for a total of <b>one hundred dinars, that one</b> of the three <b>should not assume the role of</b> a sole <b>litigant</b> and claim one hundred dinars, <b>and</b> the other <b>two</b> will assume the role of <b>witnesses so that they will exact</b> payment of <b>one hundred dinars</b> from the debtor <b>and divide</b> it among them? It is derived <b>as the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter.”</b>
There are three <i>halakhot</i> with regard to a judge: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard to <b>two</b> individuals <b>who came to judgment, one dressed in rags and one dressed in a garment worth one hundred</b> times <b>one hundred dinars, that</b> the judges <b>say to</b> the wealthy person: <b>Dress like</b> the poor person <b>or dress</b> the poor person in a garment <b>like yours?</b> It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter.”</b> The Gemara relates: <b>When</b> individuals <b>would come before Rava bar Rav Huna</b> for judgment <b>he</b> would <b>say to them: Remove your fine shoes [<i>puzmukaikhu</i>] and descend for judgment,</b> so you will not appear more distinguished than the other litigant.
<b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that a judge should not hear the statement of</b> one <b>litigant before the other litigant comes</b> to court? It is derived <b>as the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter.”</b>
<b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>a litigant shall not explain</b> the rationale behind <b>his statements to the judge before the other litigant comes</b> to court? It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Distance yourself from a false matter.” Rav Kahana teaches</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from</b> that which is written: <b>“You shall not accept [<i>lo tissa</i>]</b> a false report” (Exodus 23:1), which he interprets as though it is written: <b>You shall not cause</b> others [<i>lo tassi</i>] to accept a false report.
The verse states: <b>“And did that which is not good among his people”</b> (Ezekiel 18:18). <b>Rav says: This</b> is referring to <b>one who comes</b> to court <b>with authorization</b> to present claims on behalf of another. <b>And Shmuel says: This</b> is referring to <b>one who purchases a field</b> concerning which <b>there are those who contest</b> ownership <b>of it,</b> as in that way, he involves himself in the disputes of others.
§ The mishna teaches that the oath of testimony <b>is practiced only with regard to</b> those <b>fit to testify.</b> The Gemara asks: This statement serves <b>to exclude what</b> person not allowed to testify who was not mentioned explicitly in the mishna? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It serves <b>to exclude a king</b> who, although he is neither a relative nor otherwise disqualified from testifying, does not testify in court. <b>And Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> It serves <b>to exclude one who plays with dice,</b> who is disqualified as a witness by rabbinic law.
The Gemara notes: According to <b>the one who says</b> that the mishna excludes <b>one who plays with dice</b> from the oath of testimony, <b>all the more so</b> should <b>a king</b> be excluded, as he does not testify by Torah law. <b>And</b> according to <b>the one who says</b> that the mishna excludes <b>a king</b> from the oath of testimony, it may exclude only a king, <b>but</b> perhaps <b>one who plays with dice</b> is not excluded, as <b>by Torah law he is fit</b> to testify <b>and it is the Sages who disqualified him.</b> Therefore, he is not excluded from the oath of testimony, which is by Torah law.
§ The mishna teaches: The oath of testimony is practiced both <b>in the presence of</b> the <b>court and not in the presence of</b> the <b>court,</b> when the potential witness takes the oath on his own. And if the oath is administered by others he is liable only when he denies, in court, any knowledge of the incident in question. This is the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: Whether the witness takes the oath on his own or whether the oath is administered by others, he is liable only when he denies, in court, any knowledge of the incident in question. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b>
<b>The Sages said</b> the explanation <b>before Rav Pappa: They disagree with regard to</b> the method of derivation by means of a verbal analogy. Is the method to <b>infer</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the source of the verbal analogy <b>and</b> derive the details <b>from</b> that source as well, or is the method to <b>infer</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from it but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place?</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Meir holds: Infer from it and</b> derive the details <b>from it.</b> The <i>halakha</i> of the oath of testimony is derived <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of an oath on <b>a deposit: Just as</b> in the case of the oath on <b>a deposit,</b> one who <b>takes the oath on his own</b> is <b>liable, so too</b> in the case of the oath of <b>testimony,</b> one who <b>takes the oath on his own</b> is <b>liable. And</b> derive the details <b>from it: Just as</b> in the case of the oath on <b>a deposit</b> one is liable <b>whether</b> he took the oath <b>in court or</b> he took the oath <b>not in court, so too</b> in the case of the oath of <b>testimony,</b> one is liable <b>whether</b> he took the oath <b>in court or</b> he took the oath <b>not in court.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis hold: Infer</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from it but interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place.</b> The <i>halakha</i> of the oath of testimony is derived from the <i>halakha</i> of an oath on a deposit: <b>Just as</b> in the case of the oath on <b>a deposit,</b> one who <b>takes the oath on his own</b> is <b>liable, so too</b> in the case of the oath of <b>testimony,</b> one <b>who takes the oath on his own</b> is <b>liable. But interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according <b>to its</b> own <b>place</b> and derive the details of the <i>halakha</i> from the <i>halakhot</i> of the oath of testimony: <b>Just as</b> in the case of <b>one who was administered an oath by others,</b> if he denies knowledge of the matter <b>in court, yes,</b> he is liable, and if his denial does <b>not</b> take place <b>in court, no,</b> he is not liable; <b>so too, one who took the oath on his own,</b> if he did so <b>in court, yes,</b> he is liable, and if he did <b>not</b> take the oath <b>in court, no,</b> he is not liable.

Daf 31b

<b>Rav Pappa said to</b> the Rabbis: <b>If the Rabbis derive</b> liability for one who takes a false oath of testimony on his own by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the oath on <b>a deposit,</b> then <b>everyone agrees: Infer from it and</b> derive the details <b>from it,</b> and even the Rabbis would concede that all of the <i>halakhot</i> of the oath of testimony are derived from the oath on a deposit; therefore, one is liable for an oath taken on one’s own even outside the court.
<b>Rather, this is the reason that the Rabbis</b> hold <b>that</b> there is no liability for the oath of testimony taken on one’s own outside the court: <b>They derive it by</b> means of an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference from the <i>halakhot</i> of the oath of testimony itself, as follows: <b>And if</b> one who was administered an oath <b>by others</b> is <b>liable,</b> when one takes the oath <b>on his own,</b> is he <b>not all the more so</b> liable?
<b>And from</b> the fact <b>that they derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>by</b> means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, one is bound by the limitations that restrict that derivation: <b>It is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source.</b> Therefore, <b>just as one who is administered an oath by others,</b> if the oath is administered <b>in court, yes,</b> he is liable, and if it is <b>not</b> administered <b>in court, no,</b> he is not liable, <b>so too, one who took the oath on his own, before a court, yes,</b> he is liable, and if it is <b>not before a court, no,</b> he is not liable.
<b>The Rabbis said to Rav Pappa: How can you say</b> that <b>it is not with regard to</b> the matter of: <b>Infer from it and</b> derive the details <b>from it,</b> that <b>they disagree? But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna <b>with regard to</b> the oath on <b>a deposit: The oath on a deposit is practiced with regard to men and with regard to women, with regard to non-relatives and with regard to relatives, with regard to</b> those <b>fit</b> to testify <b>and with regard to</b> those <b>unfit</b> to testify. The oath on a deposit is practiced both <b>in the presence of</b> the <b>court and not in the presence of</b> the <b>court,</b> when the bailee takes the oath <b>on his own. And</b> if the oath is administered <b>by others, he is not liable until he denies</b> responsibility for the deposit <b>in court.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: Whether</b> the bailee takes the oath <b>on his own or whether</b> the oath is administered <b>by others, once he denied</b> the claim concerning the deposit he is <b>liable.</b>
The question arises: <b>From where</b> do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive <b>that one who is administered an oath on a deposit by others</b> is <b>liable,</b> given that an oath of that kind is not mentioned in the Torah in the context of an oath on a deposit? <b>Is it not that they derive it from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the oath of <b>testimony? And conclude from it</b> that it is <b>with regard to</b> the matter of: <b>Infer from it and</b> derive the details <b>from it,</b> that <b>they disagree?</b> The Rabbis hold: Infer the <i>halakha</i> from it but interpret the <i>halakha</i> according to its own place. The fact that one is liable for an oath on a deposit that is administered by others is derived from the oath of testimony, but one does not derive that one is liable only if that oath is administered in the presence of a court. Rather, the oath on a deposit administered by others is derived from an oath on a deposit taken on one’s own; one is liable in both cases for an oath taken not in the presence of the court.
Rav Pappa said to the Rabbis: <b>From that</b> mishna, <b>yes,</b> it is evident that the Rabbis and Rabbi Meir disagree with regard to the matter of: Infer from it and derive the details from it. However, <b>no</b> inference is <b>to be learned from this</b> mishna taught with regard to the oath of testimony, as perhaps the Rabbis derived their opinion by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And one is liable for</b> the act of taking a false <b>oath with intent.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived that one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering for taking a false oath of testimony with intent? It is derived <b>as the Sages taught: In all of</b> the other cases where one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering (see Leviticus 5:2–4), i.e., the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods, and violating an oath on an utterance, <b>it is stated: “And it is hidden”; but here,</b> with regard to the oath of testimony, it <b>is not stated: And it is hidden,</b> which serves <b>to render</b> one <b>liable</b> for taking the oath <b>intentionally</b> just <b>as</b> he is liable for taking the oath <b>unwittingly.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> one is liable <b>for an unwitting</b> act of taking a false oath provided that he takes the oath <b>with intent</b> in terms of <b>the testimony.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case of <b>an unwitting</b> act of taking a false oath <b>with intent</b> in terms of <b>the testimony? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that this is <b>in</b> the case of <b>one who says: I know that</b> taking <b>this</b> false <b>oath</b> that I do not know the relevant information is <b>prohibited, but I do not know whether or not one is liable</b> to bring <b>an offering for</b> taking that oath.
The mishna teaches: <b>But they are not liable for</b> taking the oath if they were <b>unwitting</b> in terms of the testimony <b>alone.</b> If one actually forgot that he knows about the matter, he is exempt from bringing an offering. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>we learn</b> in the mishna <b>that which</b> Rav said in response to the dispute <b>of Rav Kahana and Rav Asi?</b> The Gemara (26a) cited a dispute between Rav Kahana and Rav Asi with regard to a certain statement of Rav, and each took an oath that his version was accurate. Rav told them that although the version of one of the <i>amora’im</i> was not accurate, he is not liable for taking a false oath, as each <i>amora</i> was convinced that his oath was true. This is not an unwitting oath; rather, it is an oath taken unaware.
The Gemara responds: <b>No, even though we learned</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna, Rav’s statement that the one who did not cite Rav’s statement accurately is exempt <b>was necessary.</b> It may <b>enter your mind to say: It is</b> only <b>here,</b> with regard to the oath of testimony, that one is exempt for unwittingly taking a false oath, <b>as: And it is hidden, is not written</b> concerning it, indicating <b>that</b> in order to be liable, <b>we require</b> that the halakhic status of the <b>unwitting</b> oath is <b>similar to</b> that of <b>an intentional</b> oath, i.e., he knows that he is taking a false oath, but he does not know that he is liable to bring an offering for doing so. Therefore, one who is unaware that it is a false oath is exempt. <b>But there,</b> in the case of Rav Kahana and Rav Asi, where each took an oath on an utterance, <b>where it is written: “And it is hidden,” even</b> if it is <b>entirely unwitting,</b> i.e., they were totally unaware that the oath was false, one might say that he is liable. Therefore, Rav <b>teaches us</b> that even in the case of an oath on an utterance, one who is unwitting to that extent is exempt.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Liability to bring a sliding-scale offering for taking a false <b>oath of testimony, how so?</b> In a case where the plaintiff <b>said to two</b> individuals: <b>Come and testify</b> on <b>my</b> behalf, and they replied: On our <b>oath we do not know any testimony on your</b> behalf, i.e., we do not have any knowledge of the matter you speak of, <b>or</b> in a case where <b>they said to him: We do not know</b> any <b>testimony on your</b> behalf, and he said to them: <b>I administer an oath to you, and they said: Amen;</b> if it was determined that they lied, <b>these</b> two witnesses <b>are liable.</b>
If <b>he administered an oath to them five times outside the court, and they came to court and admitted</b> that they had knowledge of the incident in question and testified, they are <b>exempt.</b> But if <b>they denied</b> knowledge of the incident in court as well, they are <b>liable for each and every one</b> of the oaths administered to them outside the court. If <b>he administered an oath to them five times before the court, and they denied</b> knowledge of the incident, <b>they are liable</b> for taking <b>only one</b> false oath. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: What is the reason</b> for this ruling? <b>Since</b> once they denied that they had any knowledge of the incident <b>they can no</b> longer <b>retract</b> that denial <b>and admit</b> that they have knowledge of the matter. Therefore, there was only one oath of testimony, and there is no liability for the remaining oaths.
If <b>both of</b> the witnesses <b>denied</b> knowledge of the incident <b>together, both of them are liable.</b> If they denied knowledge <b>one after the other, the first</b> who denied knowledge is <b>liable, and the second</b> is <b>exempt,</b> as once the first witness denies knowledge of the incident, the second is an individual witness, whose testimony is not decisive. If <b>one</b> of the two witnesses <b>denied</b> knowledge of the incident, <b>and</b> the other <b>one admitted</b> that he had knowledge and proceeded to testify, <b>the one who denies</b> knowledge of the incident is <b>liable.</b>
If <b>there were two sets of witnesses</b> that took the oath of testimony, and <b>the first</b> set <b>denied</b> knowledge of the matter <b>and then the second</b> set <b>denied</b> knowledge of the matter, <b>both of</b> the sets <b>are liable, because the testimony can exist with either of them,</b> as even after the first set denies knowledge of the incident, the second remains capable of providing decisive testimony.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Shmuel says:</b> If the witnesses <b>saw</b> the plaintiff <b>pursuing them,</b> and <b>they said to him:</b> For <b>what</b> reason <b>are you pursuing us?</b> On our <b>oath we do not know</b> any <b>testimony on your</b> behalf, they are <b>exempt, until they will hear</b> a demand to testify directly <b>from his mouth.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Shmuel <b>teaching us? We learn</b> this in a mishna (35a): If the plaintiff <b>sent</b> a request for testimony <b>with his servant, or</b> if <b>the respondent said to</b> the potential witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you that if you know</b> any <b>testimony on behalf of</b> the plaintiff, i.e., my opponent in the litigation, <b>you will come and testify on his behalf,</b> and they took a false oath that they have no knowledge of the incident, <b>they are exempt,</b>

Daf 32a

<b>until they hear</b> a demand to testify directly <b>from the mouth of the plaintiff.</b>
The Gemara answers: Mentioning the case of the plaintiff <b>pursuing them was necessary for</b> Shmuel, as otherwise it could <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> the plaintiff <b>is pursuing them,</b> it is <b>like</b> the case of <b>one who says to them</b> directly to testify. Therefore, Shmuel <b>teaches us</b> that although the intent of the plaintiff is for them to testify, the witnesses are liable only if he tells them so explicitly.
The Gemara asks: <b>But this too, we learn</b> in the mishna: Liability to bring a sliding-scale offering for taking a false <b>oath of testimony, how so?</b> In a case where the plaintiff <b>said to</b> two <b>witnesses: Come and testify</b> on <b>my</b> behalf, and they replied: On our <b>oath, etc.,</b> from which it can be inferred that if the plaintiff <b>said</b> this to the witnesses, <b>yes,</b> they are liable, and if he <b>did not say</b> this to the witnesses, <b>no,</b> they are not liable.
The Gemara rejects this: No proof may be cited from the mishna, as perhaps when the <i>tanna</i> states: In a case where the plaintiff <b>said,</b> he did <b>not</b> mean that this is the <i>halakha</i> only in a case where he <b>specifically</b> verbalized his demand that they testify; rather, the same would be true even if he conveyed his intent in a non-verbal manner.
<b>As, if you do not say so</b> and assert that the language of the mishna is precise and one is liable only if the oath was in response to a verbal demand, then as for the mishna (36b), <b>which teaches with regard to a deposit:</b> Liability to bring a guilt-offering for taking a false <b>oath on a deposit, how so?</b> In a case where the owner <b>said to</b> the bailee: <b>Give me</b> the <b>deposit that belongs to me</b> and is <b>in your possession,</b> would you say there, <b>also,</b> that if the owner <b>said</b> this to the bailee, <b>yes,</b> he is liable, and if he <b>did not say</b> this to the bailee, <b>no,</b> he is not liable? <b>But</b> doesn’t the verse <b>“And deals falsely with his colleague</b> in a matter of deposit” (Leviticus 5:21) indicate that the bailee is liable for any denial of the deposit <b>at all,</b> unrelated to the nature of the claim raised by the owner of the item?
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that when the <i>tanna</i> says with regard to the oath on a deposit: In a case where the owner <b>said</b> to the bailee, he did <b>not</b> mean that this is the <i>halakha</i> only in a case where he <b>specifically</b> verbalized his demand. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to the oath of testimony, the <i>tanna</i> did <b>not</b> mean that this is the <i>halakha</i> only in a case where the plaintiff <b>specifically</b> verbalized his demand.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is this</b> comparison? <b>Granted, if you say that here,</b> when the <i>tanna</i> says in the mishna with regard to the oath of testimony: In a case where the plaintiff <b>said</b> to two individuals, it is <b>specifically</b> in a case where the plaintiff verbalized his demand, one could explain that the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught there,</b> with regard to the oath on a deposit: In a case where the owner said, <b>due to</b> the fact that he employed that formulation <b>here</b> in the mishna. <i>Tanna’im</i> frequently employ uniform language in different cases, even though there are halakhic differences between them. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>neither there</b> with regard to the oath on a deposit is it <b>specifically</b> in a case where the owner verbally <b>said, nor here</b> with regard to the oath of testimony is it <b>specifically</b> in a case where the plaintiff verbally <b>said, why do I</b> need <b>to teach: Said, said,</b> in both instances?
The Gemara answers: <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is teaching us the matter</b> in <b>the manner in which</b> it typically occurs, as both a plaintiff and the owner of a deposit typically articulate their claims verbally. It may still be that if the demand was conveyed non-verbally, the witness is liable. Since there is no proof from the mishna, the statement of Shmuel is necessary to teach that if the demand is not articulated verbally, the witness is not liable for taking a false oath.
The Gemara notes that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel:</b> In a case where the witnesses <b>saw that</b> the plaintiff <b>was pursuing them,</b> and <b>they said to him:</b> For <b>what</b> reason <b>are you pursuing us;</b> on our <b>oath we do not know testimony on your</b> behalf, <b>they are exempt. And if</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> an oath on <b>a deposit,</b> in a case where the owner is pursuing the bailee and he denies that the deposit is in his possession, the bailees <b>are liable,</b> as they are liable for any denial of the deposit at all, irrespective of the nature of the claim raised by the owner of the item.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>he administered an oath to them five times</b> and they came to court and admitted that they had knowledge of the incident and testified, they are exempt. But if they denied knowledge of the incident in court as well, they are liable for each and every one of the oaths administered to them outside the court.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive <b>that it is</b> specifically <b>for denial in court that they are liable,</b> and <b>they are not liable for</b> denial <b>outside court?</b>
<b>Abaye said:</b> It is derived as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the oath of testimony: <b>“If he does not utter it, he shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), from which it is derived: <b>I said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>to you only in a place where, were this</b> witness <b>to utter</b> his testimony, <b>that</b> other individual <b>becomes liable</b> to make <b>a monetary</b> payment, i.e., in court. He is not liable for denial in a place where his testimony would not render one liable to pay.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: If so, say</b> that it is not the denial but <b>the oath itself;</b> if it is taken <b>in court, yes,</b> he is liable, <b>and</b> if it is <b>that</b> which is <b>not</b> taken <b>in court, no,</b> he is not liable.
Abaye said to Rav Pappa: That should <b>not enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse: “And it will be when he is guilty <b>of any one</b> of these” (Leviticus 5:5), serves <b>to render</b> one <b>liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for each and every</b> instance when one repeatedly performs the transgressions for which one is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that one is liable only for an oath taken <b>in court, is one liable for each and every</b> oath? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: If <b>he administered an oath to them five times before the court, and they denied</b> knowledge of any testimony relating to the incident, <b>they are liable</b> for taking <b>only one</b> false oath. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: What is the reason</b> for this ruling? <b>Since</b> once they denied that they had any knowledge of the matter <b>they can no</b> longer <b>retract</b> that denial <b>and admit</b> that they have knowledge of the matter. Abaye explains: <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it</b> that one is liable for each and every <b>oath</b> taken <b>outside court;</b> but one is liable only if the <b>denial</b> is <b>in court?</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>both of</b> the witnesses <b>denied</b> knowledge of the incident <b>together,</b> both of them <b>are liable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t it <b>impossible</b> for two events <b>to coincide precisely?</b> By necessity, one denial must have preceded the other.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says:</b> It is <b>possible</b> for two events <b>to coincide precisely.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, the mishna can be interpreted in a case <b>where both of them denied</b> knowledge of relevant testimony <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase, <b>and</b> the halakhic status of a pause or retraction <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase <b>is like</b> that of continuous <b>speech.</b> Although the two statements did not coincide precisely, their halakhic status is as if they did.
<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: After all, how long is</b> the duration of: <b>Within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase? It is an interval <b>equivalent to</b> the duration of <b>the</b> three-word <b>greeting of a student to</b> his <b>teacher:</b> <i>Shalom alekha rabbi</i>. <b>Some say</b> that it is a briefer interval, <b>equivalent to</b> the duration of <b>the</b> two-word <b>greeting of a teacher to</b> his <b>student:</b> <i>Shalom alekha</i>. According to either opinion, in the time that elapses <b>until</b> the two of them <b>say:</b> On my <b>oath we do not know</b> any <b>testimony for you, it is</b> an interval <b>greater</b> than the time required to utter those words. How, then, can the mishna be interpreted as referring to a case where they stated their denials within the time required for speaking those words? Ravina <b>said to</b> Rav Aḥa of Difti: The case in the mishna is one where <b>each and every</b> potential witness will issue his denial <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking,</b> starting from the end of the statement <b>of the other.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If they denied knowledge <b>one after the other, the first</b> one who denied knowledge is <b>liable, and the second</b> one is <b>exempt,</b> as once the first witness denies knowledge of the incident, the second is an individual witness, whose testimony is not decisive, and he is exempt from the oath of testimony. The Gemara notes: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who administers an oath to one witness,</b> the witness is <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering for taking a false oath of testimony; <b>and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, deems</b> the witness <b>liable</b> to bring an offering. In his opinion, the second witness in the case in the mishna would be liable, not exempt.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that <b>they disagree about this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds: When one witness comes</b> to testify, <b>it is to</b> render the one against whom he is testifying liable to take <b>an oath,</b> and that is the reason <b>that he is coming,</b> as one witness cannot render him liable to make a monetary payment. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds: When one witness comes</b> to testify, <b>it is to</b> render the one against whom he is testifying liable to make <b>a monetary</b> payment, and that is the reason that <b>he is coming.</b> The <i>tanna’im</i> disagree whether denial by one witness constitutes a denial with regard to monetary matters.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> their dispute in that way? <b>Doesn’t Abaye say: All</b> concede <b>with regard to a witness</b> in the case <b>of a <i>sota</i></b> that he is liable for taking a false oath of testimony; <b>and all concede with regard to witnesses</b> in the case <b>of a <i>sota</i>; and</b> there is <b>a dispute with regard to witnesses</b> in the case <b>of a <i>sota</i>. All concede with regard to one witness</b> that he is not liable for taking a false oath of testimony because he cannot render another liable to make a monetary payment; <b>and all concede with regard to a witness</b> testifying on behalf of the claimant <b>when his counterpart,</b> the defendant, <b>is suspect about the oath.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather, all concede</b> that <b>when one witness comes</b> to testify, it is to render the one against whom he is testifying liable <b>to</b> take <b>an oath,</b> and that is the reason <b>he is coming. And here they disagree about this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds: A matter that causes financial</b> loss <b>is considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value. Although the testimony of one witness does not render one liable for monetary payment, occasionally the party against whom he testified will prefer to pay rather than take the oath that the witness rendered him liable to take. In those cases, the testimony of one witness does in fact cause money to be paid. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds:</b> A matter that causes financial loss <b>is not considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value.
§ With regard to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself, Abaye says: All concede with regard to a witness</b> in the case <b>of a <i>sota</i></b> that he is liable for taking a false oath of testimony; <b>and all concede with regard to witnesses</b> in the case <b>of a <i>sota</i>; and</b> there is <b>a dispute with regard to witnesses</b> in the case <b>of a <i>sota</i>. All concede with regard to one witness, and all concede with regard to a witness</b> testifying on behalf of the claimant <b>when his counterpart is suspect about the oath.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>All concede with regard to a witness</b> in the case <b>of a <i>sota</i> that</b> he is <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony <b>in</b> the case of <b>a witness of impurity.</b> This is referring to a case where the husband issues a warning to his wife in the presence of two witnesses that she may not enter into seclusion with a certain man and witnesses testify that she entered into seclusion with him, and one witness testifies that she engaged in intercourse with that man, <b>as</b> in that case <b>the Merciful One accorded credibility to</b> the witness, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>: <b>“And there is no witness against her”</b> (Numbers 5:13), that she engaged in intercourse. From that verse it is derived that <b>any</b> witness <b>that there is against her</b> is sufficient to render her forbidden to her husband and enable him to divorce her without paying the sum stipulated in the marriage contract. Therefore, the witness who testified that she engaged in intercourse with that man is for all intents and purposes a witness to a monetary matter.
<b>And all concede with regard to witnesses</b> in the case <b>of a <i>sota</i> that</b> each witness is <b>exempt</b> from liability due to a false oath of testimony. This is referring <b>to</b> the case of <b>witnesses of warning,</b> who testify that the jealous husband warned his wife not to enter into seclusion with a certain man, <b>as</b> each witness <b>is</b> the <b>cause of a cause</b> of financial loss, not a direct cause of that loss. In order to lose payment of her marriage contract, in addition to the witnesses of warning, witnesses of seclusion would also be required, after which either a witness would testify that she engaged in intercourse or she would be required to drink the bitter water of a <i>sota</i>, either of which would confirm that she engaged in an adulterous relationship.

Daf 32b

<b>And</b> there is <b>a dispute with regard to witnesses</b> in the case <b>of a <i>sota</i>;</b> this is referring <b>to witnesses of seclusion</b> who testify that the woman who was warned by her husband in fact entered into seclusion with the man in question. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>a matter that causes financial</b> loss <b>is considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value, <b>and</b> each witness is <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony, as had they testified the woman would lose her marriage contract. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>hold</b> that a matter that causes financial loss <b>is not considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value, <b>and he is exempt.</b>
§ It is stated above further: <b>All concede with regard to</b> a witness testifying on behalf of the claimant <b>when his counterpart is suspect about the oath. All concede in</b> the case of <b>one witness,</b> as in the incident <b>with Rabbi Abba.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>All concede with regard to</b> a witness testifying on behalf of the claimant <b>when his counterpart is suspect about the oath.</b> The testimony of one witness renders the borrower liable to take an oath that he does not owe money. The Gemara asks: In a case <b>where who is suspect? If we say that the borrower</b> who is denying the debt <b>is suspect,</b> and it is a case <b>where the lender says to</b> the witness: <b>If you came</b> and <b>testified on my</b> behalf <b>I would have taken an oath and taken</b> the sum owed me from the borrower, since he is suspect with regard to oaths, why would the witness be liable for taking a false oath of testimony? <b>Let</b> the witness <b>say to</b> the lender: <b>Who</b> could <b>say that you</b> would have <b>taken an oath?</b> Since there is no certainty that he would have taken the oath, the witness is merely the cause of a cause of financial loss.
<b>Rather,</b> it is a case <b>where both</b> the borrower and the lender <b>are suspect, as the Master says:</b> Since both are suspect, the <b>oath reverts to the one who is</b> initially <b>obligated to take it,</b> i.e., the borrower, <b>and since he is unable to take the oath</b> because he is suspect, <b>he pays</b> the entire claim to the lender. One witness rendered the borrower liable to pay the debt.
Abaye said: <b>All concede in</b> the case of <b>one witness,</b> as in the incident <b>with Rabbi Abba.</b> What are the circumstances? <b>As</b> there was <b>a certain man who snatched</b> a silver <b>ingot from another.</b> The one from whom it was taken <b>came before Rabbi Ami</b> while <b>Rabbi Abba was sitting before him,</b> and he <b>went</b> and <b>brought one witness</b> who testified <b>that</b> the defendant indeed <b>snatched it from him.</b> The one who snatched it <b>said to him: Yes,</b> it is true that <b>I snatched</b> it, <b>but I</b> merely <b>snatched</b> that which was <b>mine.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ami said: How shall judges rule in this case? Let</b> the judges require him to <b>pay.</b> But <b>there are not two witnesses</b> who witnessed the robbery. <b>Let</b> the judges rule to <b>exempt him</b> from payment. <b>But there is one witness that he snatched</b> the ingot. Based on the testimony of that witness, <b>let</b> the alleged robber <b>take an oath</b> that he did not snatch the ingot. But <b>once he said: Yes, I snatched</b> it, <b>but I</b> merely <b>snatched</b> that which was <b>mine,</b> his halakhic status <b>is like</b> that of <b>a robber,</b> who is disqualified from taking an oath. <b>Rabbi Abba said to him: He is</b> one who is <b>obligated</b> to take <b>an oath but is unable to take an oath, and anyone who is obligated</b> to take <b>an oath but is unable to take an oath</b> is liable to <b>pay.</b> In that case, were that witness to take a false oath and deny knowledge of the matter, he would be liable.
§ <b>Rav Pappa says: All concede with regard to</b> the <b>witness of a death that he is liable</b> for taking an oath of testimony if he took a false oath and denied knowledge of the incident, <b>and all concede with regard to</b> the <b>witness of a death that he is exempt</b> in that case.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>All concede with regard to</b> the <b>witness of a death that he is exempt where he said to</b> the wife <b>herself</b> that her husband is dead, <b>but he did not tell</b> it <b>to the court,</b> and now he denies his earlier statement, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Eduyyot</i> 1:12): <b>The woman who said: My husband died, shall remarry</b> on the basis of her own testimony. Likewise, if she says: <b>My husband died, she shall enter into levirate marriage</b> with her brother-in-law on the basis of her own testimony. The fact that the witness subsequently denied knowledge of the matter does not cause her to lose her marriage contract, since she can come to the court and testify based on the statement of the witness and collect her marriage contract.
<b>All concede with regard to</b> the <b>witness of a death that he is liable</b> in a case <b>where he did not say</b> that the husband is dead <b>to</b> the wife <b>herself nor did he say</b> it <b>to the court.</b> In that case, his denial of knowledge of the matter causes the wife to lose payment of her marriage contract.
The Gemara asks: Shall we <b>conclude from</b> here that according to Rav Pappa, in the case of <b>one who administers an oath to witnesses</b> with regard to <b>land,</b> the witnesses are <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony, given that the marriage contract here is collected from land belonging to the husband? This matter is subject to a dispute between the Sages (37b). The Gemara answers: No proof may be cited from here, as <b>perhaps</b> Rav Pappa is referring to a case <b>where she seizes</b> her husband’s <b>movable property</b> as payment for her marriage contract. Therefore, this is not considered testimony with regard to land.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>one</b> of the two witnesses <b>denied</b> knowledge of the incident, <b>and</b> the other <b>one admitted</b> that he had knowledge and proceeded to testify, <b>the one who denies</b> knowledge of the incident is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: Why was it necessary to teach this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna? <b>Now</b> that in the previous case, where the potential witnesses <b>both</b> denied knowledge of the matter <b>one after the other, you said: The first is liable and the second is exempt,</b> in a case where <b>one denied</b> knowledge <b>and one admitted</b> that he had knowledge and proceeded to testify, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to mention that the one who denied knowledge is liable?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where both of them denied</b> knowledge of the matter, <b>and one of them retracted</b> his denial <b>and admitted</b> to knowledge of the matter <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase. <b>And this teaches us that</b> the halakhic status of a pause or retraction <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase <b>is like</b> that of continuous <b>speech.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Rav Ḥisda, who interprets</b> the previous case in the mishna in which the two witnesses denied knowledge of the incident as one, and they are liable <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> a different <i>halakha</i> may be learned from each clause in the mishna. It is learned from <b>the first clause</b> that it is <b>possible</b> for two events <b>to coincide precisely, and the latter clause was necessary to teach us that</b> the halakhic status of a pause or retraction <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase <b>is like</b> that of continuous <b>speech. But according to Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>Within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase, is learned from <b>the first clause,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>Within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase, is learned from <b>the latter clause. Why do I</b> need <b>two</b> clauses to teach the same <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara answers: Even according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, both clauses are necessary. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>this statement:</b> The halakhic status of a pause or retraction within the time required for speaking a short phrase is like that of continuous speech, applies only in a case where the first statement is <b>a denial and</b> the second statement is <b>a denial; but</b> in a case where the first statement is <b>a denial and</b> the second statement is <b>an admission, say</b> that <b>no,</b> its halakhic status is not like that of continuous speech and one cannot admit knowledge after having denied it. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that even in a case where he retracts the denial and admits his knowledge, its halakhic status is not like that of continuous speech.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>there were two sets of witnesses</b> that took the oath of testimony, and <b>the first</b> set <b>denied</b> knowledge of the matter <b>and thereafter, the second</b> set <b>denied</b> knowledge of the matter, both sets of witnesses are liable. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the <b>second</b> set <b>will be held liable, as</b> since <b>the first</b> set <b>denied</b> knowledge of the matter, the ability of the plaintiff to collect his monetary claim is dependent exclusively on the second set, and their denial caused his loss. <b>But why</b> is the <b>first</b> set liable?

Daf 33a

<b>But</b> the <b>second</b> set of witnesses still <b>stands</b> available to testify, so what loss did the first set cause the plaintiff when they denied knowledge of the matter?
<b>Ravina said: What are we dealing with here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the two witnesses in the <b>second</b> set <b>were relatives through their wives at the time of the denial of the first</b> set of witnesses. The two witnesses in the second set were married to two sisters, and brothers-in-law are unfit to serve as witnesses together. Therefore, the claim of the plaintiff is entirely dependent upon the testimony of the first set of witnesses. <b>And</b> the sisters who were <b>wives</b> of the witnesses in the second set <b>were moribund. Lest you say</b> that since, presumably, the <b>majority</b> of individuals who are <b>moribund will</b> actually <b>die</b> very soon, and therefore these two witnesses are fit to testify together, therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that since <b>now in any event,</b> the wives <b>had not</b> yet <b>died,</b> their husbands remain unfit to testify together.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case where the plaintiff said to the witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your refusal to testify <b>if you do not come and testify on my behalf that I have in the possession of so-and-so a deposit, and</b> an outstanding <b>loan, and a stolen item, and a lost item,</b> and they lied in reply: On our <b>oath we do not know</b> any <b>testimony on your behalf, they are liable</b> for taking <b>only one</b> false oath of testimony.
But if they lied in reply: On our <b>oath we do not know that you have in the possession of so-and-so a deposit, and</b> an outstanding <b>loan, and a stolen item, and a lost item, they are liable for each and every one</b> of the components of the claim. It is as though they took a separate oath with regard to each of the details of the claim.
In a case where the plaintiff said to the witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your refusal to testify <b>if you do not come and testify that I have in the possession of so-and-so a deposit of wheat, and barley, and spelt,</b> and they lied in reply: On our <b>oath we do not know</b> any <b>testimony on your</b> behalf, <b>they are liable</b> for taking <b>only one</b> false oath of testimony.
But if they lied in reply: On our <b>oath we do not know</b> any <b>testimony on your</b> behalf <b>that you have in the possession of so-and-so wheat, and barley, and spelt, they are liable for each and every one</b> of the components of the claim.
In a case where the plaintiff said to the witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your refusal to testify <b>if you do not come and testify on my behalf that I have in the possession of so-and-so</b> an outstanding payment for <b>damage; or</b> an outstanding payment for <b>half the damage,</b> which the owner pays for damage caused by his innocuous ox goring another animal; <b>or</b> with regard to an outstanding <b>payment of double</b> the principal that a thief must pay the owner of the stolen item; <b>or</b> with regard to an outstanding <b>payment of four or five</b> times the principal that a thief pays when he stole a sheep or an ox, respectively, and then slaughtered or sold it; <b>or</b> in a case where the plaintiff said: I administer an oath to you concerning your refusal to testify if you do not come and testify <b>that so-and-so raped my daughter; or, he seduced my daughter; or, that my son struck me; or, that another injured me; or, that he set my stack of grain on fire on Yom Kippur;</b> if in any of these cases the witnesses took an oath falsely denying any knowledge of the matter on behalf of the plaintiff, <b>these</b> witnesses <b>are liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In a case where <b>one administers an oath to witnesses concerning a fine</b> if they do not come and testify that one performed an action that renders him liable to pay a sum fixed by the Torah as penalty for that action, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it like any other case of an oath administered to witnesses in monetary matters or not?
The Gemara refines the dilemma: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, do not raise the dilemma, as he says</b> in a case where one performed an action in the presence of witnesses for which he is liable to pay a fine, and before the witnesses testified, he admitted his liability, even though the principle is: One who admits that he is liable to pay a fine is exempt from paying the fine, <b>the witnesses shall come and testify</b> and render the one who performed the action liable to pay the fine. In his opinion, payment of the fine is dependent upon their testimony, and therefore if they lie, they are liable for taking a false oath of testimony.
<b>When should you raise the dilemma?</b> Raise it <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>as they say:</b> One who <b>admits</b> he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is exempt,</b> even if <b>afterward witnesses came</b> and testified to his liability. The case in the mishna is one where the plaintiff demanded that the witnesses testify on his behalf before the defendant admitted knowledge of the fine.
The Gemara seeks to clarify: <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who expressed their opinion <b>there</b> that one who admits he is liable to pay a fine is exempt, even if afterward witnesses come, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>do they hold? If we say</b> that they hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> cited <b>here</b> (32a), <b>doesn’t he say: A matter that causes financial</b> loss <b>is considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value with regard to the oath of testimony? Witnesses who testify concerning a fine also cause financial loss, as, if the individual does not admit his liability, he will be liable to pay the fine based on their testimony.
<b>Rather,</b> apparently, the Rabbis there hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis here, who say: A matter that causes financial</b> loss <b>is not considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value. It is according to that opinion that the dilemma is raised: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in the case of witnesses to a fine? Does one say: <b>Since if the</b> one liable to pay the fine <b>admits</b> his liability, <b>he is exempt</b> from paying the fine, the witness taking the oath denying knowledge of the matter <b>is not denying a monetary</b> claim, and therefore, he is not liable for taking a false oath of testimony? <b>Or perhaps</b> since <b>now, in any event, he has not</b> yet <b>admitted</b> liability, payment of the fine is dependent upon the testimony of these witnesses and it is considered a monetary matter for which they are liable for taking a false oath of testimony.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the mishna to resolve the dilemma: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your refusal to testify <b>if you do not come and testify on my behalf that I have in the possession of so-and-so</b> an unpaid payment for <b>damage; and</b> likewise, an unpaid payment for <b>half the damage.</b> In those cases the witnesses can be held liable for the oath of testimony. <b>But isn’t</b> payment for <b>half the damage</b> payment of <b>a fine?</b> The Gemara rejects this proof: This mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that payment of <b>half the damage is monetary restitution</b> and not a fine.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that payment of <b>half the damage is monetary restitution. But according to the one who says</b> that payment of half the damage is payment of <b>a fine, what can be said?</b> The Gemara answers: In his opinion, the mishna is referring to a case where the plaintiff demands that the witnesses testify <b>with regard to</b> liability to pay for <b>half the damage</b> caused by <b>pebbles</b> inadvertently propelled by the foot of a walking animal, <b>as they learned this <i>halakha</i> through tradition</b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai <b>that</b> payment of half the damage in that case <b>is monetary restitution,</b> not a fine. Therefore, no proof may be cited from the mishna with regard to liability for taking a false oath of testimony concerning a fine.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the mishna to resolve the dilemma: I administer an oath to you concerning your refusal to testify if you do not come and testify that I have in the possession of so-and-so an unpaid <b>payment of double</b> the principal, for which the witnesses are also liable for taking a false oath of testimony. But isn’t that payment of a fine? The Gemara responds: The liability for taking a false oath of testimony in that case is not due to their denial of knowledge of the matter with regard to the fine; rather, the liability is <b>due to</b> their denial of knowledge of the matter with regard to <b>the principal,</b> which is a full-fledged monetary payment.
The Gemara cites another proof from the mishna: I administer an oath to you concerning your refusal to testify if you do not come and testify that I have in the possession of so-and-so <b>payment of four or five</b> times the principal, which is a fine. The Gemara answers: There too, the liability is <b>due to</b> their denial of knowledge of the matter with regard to <b>the principal,</b> not due to the fine.
The Gemara cites another proof from the continuation of the mishna: I administer an oath to you concerning your refusal to testify if you do not come and testify <b>that so-and-so raped my daughter; or, he seduced my daughter.</b> Isn’t the payment for rape and seduction a fine of 50 <i>sela</i>? The Gemara rejects this: There, the liability of the witnesses is <b>due to</b> their denial of knowledge of the matter with regard to payment for <b>humiliation and</b> compensation for <b>degradation</b> of the value of the young woman resulting from the rape or the seduction. Those are categorized as monetary restitution, not as fines.
The Gemara asks: According to this understanding, <b>what is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaching us</b> with the multiplicity of cases in the mishna? <b>All</b> the cases in the mishna are of <b>monetary restitution.</b> The Gemara answers: In <b>the first clause,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us one</b> novel element, and in <b>the latter clause,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us one</b> novel element. In <b>the first clause,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us one</b> novel element, <b>that</b> liability to pay for <b>half the damage</b> caused by <b>pebbles is monetary restitution,</b> not a fine.
In <b>the latter clause,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us one</b> novel element: I administer an oath to you concerning your refusal to testify if you do not come and testify <b>that he set my stack of grain on fire on Yom Kippur. What</b> does this <i>halakha</i> serve <b>to exclude?</b> It serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana would deem Yom Kippur like Shabbat with regard to payment</b> of damages. <b>Just as</b> in the case of one who intentionally desecrates <b>Shabbat,</b> he is liable to receive the death penalty and is therefore exempt from liability for payment for damage that is caused while desecrating Shabbat, so too, in the case of one who intentionally desecrates Yom Kippur, he is liable to receive the death penalty and is therefore exempt from liability for payment for damage that is caused while desecrating Yom Kippur. The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna disagrees.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i> to resolve the dilemma: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your refusal to testify <b>if you do not come and testify on my</b> behalf

Daf 33b

<b>that so-and-so slandered my daughter.</b> In such a case, the witnesses are <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony. If the accused <b>admitted on his own</b> that he slandered the young woman, he is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fine. The only payment in the case of a husband who falsely accuses his bride of adultery is payment of a fine, and yet the <i>baraita</i> says that the witnesses are liable for taking a false oath of testimony.
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, who says:</b> Even if the one who is liable to pay the fine admits his liability, <b>the witnesses shall come and testify</b> and render the one who performed the action liable to pay the fine.
The Gemara asks: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: If that man <b>admitted on his own</b> that he slandered the young woman, he is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fine. Ostensibly, in this <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that if the one who is liable admits his liability before the witnesses testify, he is exempt from paying the fine, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon.
The Gemara explains: The <i>baraita</i> in <b>its entirety is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, and this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying</b> in the latter clause: <b>You find</b> a case of one who <b>admitted</b> liability <b>on his own that</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fine, <b>only</b> in a case <b>where there are no witnesses at all and he admitted</b> liability <b>on his own.</b> In a case where there are witnesses, he is liable to pay the fine on the basis of their testimony even if he admitted liability.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case where the plaintiff said to two witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your refusal to testify <b>if you do not come and testify that I am a priest,</b> or <b>that I am a Levite,</b> or <b>that I am not the son of</b> a priest and <b>a divorced woman,</b> or <b>that I am not the son of</b> a priest and <b>a <i>ḥalutza</i>,</b> or <b>that so-and-so is a priest,</b> or <b>that so-and-so is a Levite,</b> or <b>that he is not the son of</b> a priest and <b>a divorced woman,</b> or <b>that he is not the son of</b> a priest and <b>a <i>ḥalutza</i>;</b> in all these cases the witnesses are exempt from liability for taking a false oath of testimony, because these do not involve monetary claims.
Likewise, if the plaintiff said to them: I administer an oath to you concerning your refusal to testify if you do not come and testify <b>that so-and-so raped his daughter, or</b> that <b>he seduced his daughter, or that my son injured me, or that another</b> person <b>wounded me</b> on Shabbat, or <b>that he set my stack of grain on fire on Shabbat;</b> in all these cases <b>these</b> witnesses <b>are exempt,</b> as each case is punishable with the death penalty, and therefore they are cases that do not involve monetary payment.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that the witnesses are exempt is that the plaintiff demanded that they testify <b>that so-and-so is a priest</b> or <b>that so-and-so is a Levite,</b> which are claims that do not involve monetary payment; <b>but</b> were the plaintiff to say: I administer an oath to you concerning your refusal to testify if you do not come and testify that <b>one hundred dinars</b> belonging <b>to so-and-so are in the possession of</b> another <b>so-and-so,</b> they would be <b>liable. But isn’t it taught</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna (35a): The witnesses are exempt <b>until they hear</b> a demand to come and testify directly <b>from the mouth of the plaintiff,</b> and here the individual administering the oath is not the plaintiff.
<b>Shmuel says:</b> The reference here is to a case <b>where</b> the individual administering the oath <b>comes with authorization</b> to demand that the witnesses testify on his behalf. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t</b> the Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: We do not write an authorization document concerning movable property?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This statement</b> that one does not write authorization for movable property applies only in a case <b>where</b> the respondent already <b>denied</b> the claim against him. <b>But</b> in a case where the respondent <b>did not</b> yet <b>deny</b> the claim against him, <b>we write</b> authorization even for movable property.
§ <b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the verse</b> with regard to an oath of testimony <b>is speaking only about</b> cases involving <b>a monetary claim? Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Multiple instances of the term <b>“or” are stated here,</b> with regard to an oath of testimony: “And he hears the voice of an oath and he is a witness or he saw or he knew” (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and</b> multiple instances of the term <b>“or” are stated there,</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit: “And he deals falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of an outstanding loan, or of robbery, or he exploited his colleague, or he found a lost item” (Leviticus 5:21–22); <b>just as there,</b> the verse <b>is speaking only about</b> cases involving <b>a monetary claim, so too here,</b> the verse <b>is speaking only about</b> cases involving <b>a monetary claim.</b>
The Gemara challenges: The multiple instances of the term <b>“or” that</b> are stated with regard to <b>a murderer:</b> “And if he shoved him with hatred or cast upon him any vessel without lying in wait or in enmity smote him with his hand” (Numbers 35:20–21), <b>will prove</b> that multiple instances of the term “or” are unrelated to limiting the application of the <i>halakha</i> to cases involving a monetary claim, <b>as</b> these <b>are</b> multiple instances of the term <b>“or”</b> in verses <b>that are not speaking about</b> cases involving <b>a monetary claim.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>One infers</b> multiple instances of the term <b>“or” with which there is an oath</b> administered, i.e., an oath of testimony, <b>from</b> multiple instances of the term <b>“or” with which there is an oath</b> administered, i.e., an oath on a deposit, <b>and</b> the multiple instances of the term <b>“or” that</b> are stated with regard to <b>a murderer will not prove</b> anything to the contrary, <b>as there is no oath in their</b> context.
The Gemara challenges: The multiple instances of the term <b>“or” that</b> are stated with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i></b> in the Torah: “Or if the spirit of jealousy came upon him…or a man upon whom a spirit of jealousy came” (Numbers 5:14, 30), <b>will prove</b> that multiple instances of the term are unrelated to a monetary claim, <b>as</b> these <b>are</b> multiple instances of the term <b>“or,” and there is an oath</b> administered by the priest to the <i>sota</i> <b>in their</b> context, <b>and</b> the verse <b>is speaking about</b> cases <b>not</b> involving <b>a monetary claim.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>One infers</b> multiple instances of the term <b>“or” with which there is an oath</b> administered <b>and with which there is no priest</b> administering it, i.e., the case of an oath of testimony, <b>from</b> multiple instances of the term <b>“or” with which there is an oath</b> administered <b>and with which there is no priest</b> administering it, i.e., an oath on a deposit, <b>and</b> the multiple instances of the term <b>“or” that</b> are stated with regard to <b>a murderer will not prove</b> anything to the contrary, <b>as there is no oath in their</b> context, <b>and</b> the multiple instances of the term <b>“or” that</b> are stated with regard to <b>a <i>sota</i> will not prove</b> anything to the contrary, <b>as even though there is an oath in their</b> context, <b>there is a priest</b> administering the oath <b>in their</b> context. This is the source from which Rabbi Eliezer proves that liability for an oath of testimony is limited to cases involving a monetary claim.
<b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that it is written with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“And it shall be when he will be guilty of one of these”</b> (Leviticus 5:5). The term “of these” is a restrictive expression from which it is derived: <b>There are</b> some <b>of these</b> for <b>which he is liable and there are</b> some <b>of these</b> for <b>which he is exempt. How so?</b> If the plaintiff <b>demanded</b> testimony from the witness with regard to <b>a monetary</b> claim, the witness is <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath; if the plaintiff demanded testimony from the witness with regard to <b>another matter,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> cites a different proof and <b>says:</b> The verse <b>states</b> with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“And he is a witness or he saw or he knew”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). It is <b>with regard to testimony that is founded on sight,</b> i.e., direct observation, <b>without knowledge</b> of the matter, <b>or by means of</b> indirect <b>knowledge</b> of the matter <b>without sight</b> that <b>the verse is speaking.</b>
<b>Sight without knowledge, how so?</b> It is a case where the creditor claims: <b>I counted one hundred dinars for you before so-and-so and so-and-so,</b> and the debtor responds: <b>Let so-and-so and so-and-so come and testify. This is</b> a case of <b>sight without knowledge,</b> as the witnesses do not know whether the money was counted as a loan, a deposit, or repayment of a loan.
<b>Knowledge without sight, how so?</b> It is a case where the creditor claims: <b>You admitted to</b> owing <b>me one hundred dinars before so-and-so and so-and-so,</b>and the debtor replied: <b>Let so-and-so and so-and-so come and testify. This is</b> a case of <b>knowledge</b> of the debt <b>without sight</b> of the loan taking place. Testimony based on sight without knowledge or based on knowledge without sight is possible only in cases involving a monetary claim.
<b>Rabbi Shimon</b> cites a different proof and <b>says:</b> The Torah rendered one <b>liable</b> if he takes a false oath <b>here</b> with regard to testimony, <b>and</b> the Torah rendered one <b>liable</b> if he takes a false oath <b>with regard to a deposit; just as there,</b> the verse <b>is speaking</b> of liability <b>only in</b> cases involving <b>a monetary claim, so too here,</b> the verse <b>is speaking</b> of liability <b>only in</b> cases involving <b>a monetary claim.</b>
<b>And furthermore,</b> one can infer this <i>halakha</i> by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference from the <i>halakha</i> of a deposit. <b>If</b> in the case of <b>a deposit, with regard to which</b> the Torah <b>rendered</b> the halakhic status <b>of women like</b> that of <b>men,</b> the halakhic status of <b>relatives like</b> that of <b>non-relatives,</b> and the halakhic status of <b>unfit</b> witnesses <b>like</b> that of those <b>fit</b> to testify, <b>and</b> he is <b>liable for</b>

Daf 34a

<b>each and every</b> oath if the plaintiff administered several oaths to him and he denied having the deposit in his possession, whether he took the oath <b>before a court or not before a court,</b> and despite the broad application of the <i>halakha</i>, the verse <b>is speaking</b> of liability <b>only in</b> cases involving <b>a monetary claim,</b> then in the case of an oath of <b>testimony with regard to which</b> the Torah <b>did not render</b> the halakhic status of <b>women like</b> that of <b>men,</b> the status of <b>relatives like</b> that of <b>non-relatives,</b> and the status of <b>unfit</b> witnesses <b>like</b> that of those <b>fit</b> to testify, <b>and he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sliding-scale offering if the plaintiff administered several oaths to him and he falsely denied knowledge of the matter <b>in the presence of a court, is it not right that</b> the verse <b>is speaking</b> of liability <b>only in</b> cases involving <b>a monetary claim?</b>
The <i>baraita</i> rejects this inference: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the case of <b>a deposit?</b> It is notable in <b>that with regard to</b> a deposit the Torah <b>did not render</b> the halakhic status of <b>one to whom an oath was administered</b> by others <b>like</b> that of <b>one who</b> himself <b>took an oath,</b> as one to whom an oath was administered by others is exempt; <b>and</b> the Torah did not render the halakhic status of one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath <b>like</b> that of one who takes <b>an unwitting</b> false oath. <b>Will you say</b> that the same is true <b>with regard to</b> an oath of <b>testimony, as in</b> that case the Torah <b>rendered</b> the halakhic status of <b>one to whom an oath was administered</b> by others <b>like</b> that of <b>one who</b> himself <b>took an oath; and</b> it rendered the halakhic status of one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath <b>like</b> that of one who takes <b>an unwitting</b> false oath, and one is liable to bring an offering in both instances?
Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the term <b>“shall sin”</b> with regard to an oath of testimony and states <b>“shall sin”</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit in order <b>to</b> derive <b>a verbal analogy. Here, it is stated</b> with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“Shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and there, it is stated</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit: <b>“Shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:21). <b>Just as there,</b> concerning an oath on a deposit, the verse <b>is speaking only with regard to a monetary claim, so too here,</b> concerning an oath of testimony, the verse <b>is speaking only with regard to a monetary claim.</b>
§ After presenting the different proofs cited in the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara proceeds to analyze the opinions cited therein, beginning with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer that one derives that one is liable for an oath of testimony only if it involves a monetary claim from the case of an oath on a deposit based on multiple instances of the term “or” that appear in both contexts, and there is an oath with those multiple instances of the term “or” and there is no priest in their context. <b>Rabba bar Ulla objects to this:</b> The multiple instances of the term “or” in the verse: <b>“Or</b> if any one shall take an oath to clearly express with his lips to do evil <b>or</b> to do good” (Leviticus 5:4), which is written with regard to an oath on <b>an utterance, will prove</b> that one is liable even without a monetary claim, <b>as they are</b> multiple instances of the term <b>“or,” and there is an oath in their</b> context, <b>and there is no priest in their</b> context, <b>and they are not speaking with regard to a monetary claim.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>he should have derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an oath of testimony <b>from</b> an oath on <b>a deposit</b> and not from an oath on an utterance <b>due to</b> the verbal analogy between the terms <b>“shall sin”</b> and <b>“shall sin.”</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>On the contrary, he should have derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an oath of testimony <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an oath on <b>an utterance, as</b> it is a derivation of one case for which one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering</b> for taking a false oath <b>from</b> another case for which one is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering</b> for taking a false oath. This is in contrast to an oath on a deposit, for which one is liable to bring a guilt-offering for taking a false oath.
<b>Rather, it stands to reason</b> that <b>he should have derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an oath of testimony <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an oath on <b>a deposit, as</b> there are many elements common to both oaths, represented by the mnemonic: <b>Sin, intentionally, claimed</b> from <b>him, denied his</b> claim, <b>and his past.</b> There is a verbal analogy between them, as the term “shall sin” appears in both contexts. In both cases one is liable for taking a false oath intentionally. Additionally, in both cases there is a claim presented by one of the parties and denial of that claim by the one taking the oath. And both oaths relate to events that transpired in the past.
The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary, he should have derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an oath of testimony <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an oath on <b>an utterance, as</b> there are many elements common to both oaths, represented by the mnemonic: <b>Sin</b>-<b>offering, that descended, to one-fifth.</b> In both cases one is liable to bring a sin-offering for a false oath, as opposed to a guilt-offering for a false oath on a deposit. In each case the offering is a sliding-scale offering, as opposed to the fixed offering in the case of an oath on a deposit. In both cases there is no payment of an additional one-fifth for taking a false oath. And in the case of a false oath on a deposit, there is payment of an additional one-fifth. The Gemara answers: <b>These</b> elements common to an oath of testimony and an oath on a deposit are more <b>numerous</b> than the elements common to an oath of testimony and an oath on an utterance.
§ <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that it is written with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“And it shall be when he will be guilty of one of these”</b> (Leviticus 5:5). The term “of these” is a restrictive expression from which it is derived: <b>There are</b> some <b>of these</b> for <b>which he is liable and there are</b> some <b>of these</b> for <b>which he is exempt. How so?</b> If the plaintiff <b>demanded</b> testimony from the witness with regard to <b>a monetary</b> claim, the witness is <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath; if the plaintiff <b>demanded</b> testimony from the witness with regard to <b>another matter,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara challenges: Since it is not clear from the verse for which claim one is liable and for which claim one is exempt, <b>I will reverse</b> it and say that one is liable only when the claim was with regard to another matter, not when it involves monetary matters.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Akiva relies on</b> the multiple instances of the term <b>“or,”</b> as cited <b>by Rabbi Eliezer,</b> to derive from an oath on a deposit that one is liable only for a false oath that involves a monetary claim. From the term “of these” Rabbi Akiva derives that there are some cases involving monetary claims for which one is not liable for taking a false oath of testimony.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva?</b> With regard to which cases involving monetary claims does Rabbi Akiva hold that one is not liable for taking a false oath of testimony?
The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between their</b> opinions is in the case of <b>one who administers an oath to witnesses</b> with regard to testimony involving <b>land. According to Rabbi Eliezer, they are liable</b> if they take a false oath. <b>According to Rabbi Akiva they are exempt</b> in that case, as it is excluded by the term “of these.”
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says there</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit and an oath of testimony that in the case of <b>one who administers an oath to witnesses</b> with regard to testimony involving <b>land,</b> the witnesses <b>are exempt even according to Rabbi Eliezer, what</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the opinions of <b>Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva?</b>
The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between their</b> opinions is in the case where one administers an oath to <b>witnesses</b> with regard to testimony involving <b>a fine.</b> According to Rabbi Eliezer they are liable, and according to Rabbi Akiva they are exempt.
§ <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> cites a different proof and <b>says:</b> The verse states with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“And he is a witness or he saw or he knew”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). It is <b>with regard to testimony that is founded on sight without knowledge</b> of the matter, <b>or by means of knowledge without sight,</b> that <b>the verse is speaking.</b> The reference is to testimony involving monetary matters, as all other testimony requires both knowledge and sight.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Shall we say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili does not accept</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Aḥa? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Kamma</i> 3:6) that <b>Rabbi Aḥa says:</b> If there is <b>a rutting</b> male <b>camel [<i>gamal haoḥer</i>]</b> that is rampaging <b>among</b> other <b>camels and</b> then <b>a camel was found killed at its side, it is evident that this</b> rampaging camel <b>killed it,</b> and the owner must pay for the damage. Rabbi Aḥa rules that cases of monetary law can be decided based on circumstantial evidence. <b>As, if he is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Aḥa</b> that witnesses may testify on the basis of circumstantial evidence, <b>in</b> cases of <b>capital law too, you find</b> a case of knowledge without sight, <b>as</b> in the case discussed by <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Shataḥ.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Shataḥ said</b> in the form of an oath: <b>I will</b> not <b>see the consolation</b> of Israel <b>if I did not see one who was running after another into a ruin, and I ran after him and found a sword in his hand and blood dripping</b> from the sword, <b>and the slain</b> person <b>convulsing. I said to him: Wicked</b> one, <b>who killed this</b> person? It was <b>either me or you,</b> as there is no one else here.
<b>But what can I do, as your blood is not given to my control</b> and I have no jurisdiction to execute you, <b>as the Torah says: “On the basis of two witnesses or three witnesses shall he that is to die be put to death”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:6), and there are no witnesses here. <b>Rather, the Omnipresent will exact retribution from you.</b> The Sages <b>said: They did not move from there until a snake came and bit</b> the pursuer <b>and he died.</b> Rabbi Aḥa would hold in that case that the pursuer could be executed by the court based on circumstantial evidence. Ostensibly, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili disagrees, as he says that testimony based on knowledge without sight exists only in cases of monetary law.
The Gemara answers: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili <b>is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Aḥa</b> that one may rely on circumstantial evidence even in cases of capital law, one may nevertheless distinguish between cases of monetary law and cases of capital law. <b>Granted,</b> even in cases of capital law <b>you find</b> testimony based on <b>knowledge without sight, but how can you find</b> a case of <b>sight without knowledge? Don’t</b> the witnesses <b>need to know if</b> the one whom he witnessed killing another <b>killed a gentile or he killed a Jew, if he killed one who has a wound that would have caused him to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>] or he killed</b> one whose body is <b>intact?</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>Conclude from it</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili holds</b> that in a case where <b>one administers an oath to witnesses</b> with regard to testimony involving <b>a fine,</b> the witnesses are <b>exempt</b> from liability for taking a false oath of testimony. <b>As if it enters your mind</b> to say that the witnesses are <b>liable, although you find</b> testimony with regard to fines based on <b>knowledge without sight,</b> and witnesses may testify based on circumstantial evidence, in cases of <b>sight without knowledge,</b> when it comes to fines, <b>don’t</b> the witnesses <b>need to know if</b> the rapist <b>engaged in intercourse with a gentile woman</b> or if <b>he engaged in intercourse with a Jewish woman,</b> if <b>he engaged in intercourse with a virgin</b> or if <b>he engaged in intercourse with a non-virgin?</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili holds that witnesses are liable for taking a false oath of testimony only in cases where both testimony based on sight alone and testimony based on knowledge alone are accepted, which is not the case concerning testimony involving fines.
§ Apropos the matter of sight without knowledge in cases of monetary law, the Gemara relates: <b>Rav Hamnuna was sitting before Rav Yehuda, and Rav Yehuda was sitting and he was raising a dilemma:</b> If one demands payment from another and claims: <b>I counted for you</b> and gave you <b>one hundred dinars in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so,</b>

Daf 34b

<b>and witnesses see him</b> counting the money <b>from outside, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is their testimony accepted?
<b>Rav Hamnuna said to</b> Rav Yehuda: <b>And what does the other</b> person <b>claim</b> in response to the demand for repayment? <b>If he says:</b> These <b>matters never happened, he assumes the presumptive status of a denier</b> of the truth, as the witnesses testify that they saw the claimant counting the money and giving it to him. <b>If he says: Yes, I took</b> money from him, <b>but</b> it is <b>my</b> money that <b>I took,</b> then <b>when</b> the <b>witnesses come</b> and testify that they saw the claimant counting the money and giving it to him, <b>what of it?</b> The testimony of the witnesses does not contradict his claim, as the witnesses do not know the circumstances under which the money changed hands. Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Are you Hamnuna? Enter</b> and <b>come</b> into the study hall, as you make your teacher wiser.
The Gemara relates a similar incident: There was <b>a certain</b> individual <b>who said to another: I counted for you</b> and gave you <b>one hundred dinars</b> as a loan <b>alongside this column.</b> The other person <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>I did not pass alongside this column. Two witnesses came and testified about him</b> that they saw <b>that he urinated alongside this column. Reish Lakish said: He assumes the presumptive status of a denier</b> of the truth, as the testimony of witnesses proves that he passed alongside the column.
<b>Rav Naḥman objects to this: That is a ruling</b> characteristic of <b>a Persian</b> court, not a reasonable ruling characteristic of a Jewish court. <b>Did</b> the respondent <b>say</b> that he <b>never</b> passed alongside the column? It was that he did not pass alongside the column <b>in</b> the context of <b>this matter</b> that <b>he said to him</b> that he did not pass the column; therefore, the testimony of the witnesses does not contradict his statement.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the incident transpired a bit differently. There was <b>a certain</b> individual <b>who said to another: I counted for you</b> and gave you <b>one hundred dinars</b> as a loan <b>alongside this column.</b> The other person <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>I never passed alongside this column. Witnesses emerged</b> and testified <b>concerning him that he urinated alongside this column. Rav Naḥman said: He assumes the presumptive status of a denier</b> of the truth, as the witnesses contradicted his claim.
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman:</b> There is no proof from here that he assumes the presumptive status of a denier, as <b>any matter that is not incumbent upon a person</b> to remember, <b>he performs it and it is not on his mind.</b> Therefore, when he denied ever passing alongside the column, it was because there was never any reason for him to remember that he had been there.
§ The Gemara proceeds to cite the opinion cited last in the <i>baraita</i> explaining the source of the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable for taking a false oath of testimony only for a case involving monetary matters. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The Torah <b>rendered</b> one <b>liable</b> if he takes a false oath <b>here,</b> with regard to an oath of testimony, <b>and</b> the Torah <b>rendered</b> one <b>liable</b> if he takes a false oath <b>with regard to</b> an oath on <b>a deposit;</b> just as there, the verse is speaking of liability only in cases involving monetary claims, so too here, the verse is speaking of liability only in cases involving monetary claims.
<b>They mocked</b> this proof <b>in the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara asked: <b>What</b> is worthy of <b>mockery</b> in the statement of Rabbi Shimon?
The Gemara explains that they mocked <b>that</b> which the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> in the continuation, rejecting the <i>a fortiori</i> inference suggested by Rabbi Shimon: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the case of <b>a deposit?</b> It is notable in <b>that with regard to</b> a deposit the Torah <b>did not render</b> the halakhic status of <b>one to whom an oath was administered</b> by others <b>like</b> that of <b>one who</b> himself <b>took an oath,</b> as one to whom an oath was administered by others is exempt; and the Torah did not render the halakhic status of one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath <b>like</b> that of one who takes <b>an unwitting</b> false oath.
This rejection is difficult: <b>Now,</b> with regard to the fact that <b>one who administered an oath to himself</b> is liable <b>in</b> the case of an oath of <b>testimony, from where</b> is it derived <b>according to Rabbi Shimon?</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>derives</b> it by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> an oath on <b>a deposit.</b> If so, based on the same verbal analogy, in the case of an oath on <b>a deposit too, let us derive from</b> the case of an oath of <b>testimony</b> the fact that one is liable for a false <b>oath</b> that <b>was administered by others.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>And what</b> is worthy of <b>mockery</b> in that statement? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Shimon</b> does not derive that one who takes a false oath of testimony on his own is liable by means of a verbal analogy from an oath on a deposit; rather, <b>he derives it by means of an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: If <b>one is liable</b> for a false oath of testimony <b>administered by others, is it not all the more so</b> that he is liable for an oath that he takes <b>on his own?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, the mockery is with regard to</b> the distinction between an oath on a deposit and an oath of testimony in the matter of whether the halakhic status of one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath is <b>like</b> that of one who takes <b>an unwitting</b> false oath, <b>as it teaches</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the case of <b>a deposit?</b> It is notable in <b>that with regard to</b> a deposit the Torah <b>did not render</b> the halakhic status of <b>one to whom an oath was administered</b> by others <b>like</b> that of <b>one who</b> himself <b>took an oath,</b> as one to whom an oath was administered by others is exempt; and the Torah did not render the halakhic status of one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath <b>like</b> that of one who takes <b>an unwitting</b> false oath.
<b>Now, from where does he</b> derive that one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath of <b>testimony</b> is liable? He derives it <b>as it is not written in</b> the context of an oath of testimony: <b>And it is hidden. Here too, it is not written in</b> the context of an oath on a deposit: <b>And it is hidden.</b> Therefore, there should be no distinction between intentional and unwitting with regard to an oath on a deposit either.
<b>Rav Huna said to</b> the Sages: <b>And what</b> is worthy of <b>mockery</b> in that statement? <b>Perhaps</b> the fact <b>that</b> the halakhic status of one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath <b>is not like</b> that of one who takes <b>an unwitting</b> false oath <b>in</b> the case of <b>a deposit,</b> and it is <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property that <b>Rabbi Shimon derived it.</b> Just as one is liable to bring a guilt-offering for the misuse of consecrated property only if he did so unwittingly, one is liable to bring a guilt-offering for a false oath on a deposit only if he unwittingly took the false oath.
The Gemara answers: <b>And that is</b> what is worthy of <b>mockery. Instead of deriving</b> the lack of liability for an intentional false oath of deposit <b>from</b> the case of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>let him derive</b> liability for an intentional false oath on a deposit <b>from</b> the case of an oath of <b>testimony.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>It stands to reason</b> that <b>he should have derived</b> it <b>from</b> the case of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>as</b> that is a derivation of <b>misuse</b> written with regard to an oath on a deposit: “If any one shall sin and commits an act of misuse and dealt falsely with his colleague in a matter of deposit” (Leviticus 5:21), which is derived <b>from misuse</b> written with regard to misuse of consecrated property: “If any one commits an act of misuse and sinned unwittingly from items consecrated to the Lord” (Leviticus 5:15).
The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary, he should have derived</b> it <b>from</b> the case of an oath of <b>testimony, as</b> that is a derivation of <b>“shall sin”</b> written with regard to an oath on a deposit which is derived <b>from “shall sin”</b> written with regard to an oath of testimony: “And if any one shall sin and he hears the voice of an oath, and he is a witness” (Leviticus 5:1).
The Gemara rejects this: <b>It stands to reason</b> that it is <b>from</b> the case of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property that <b>he should have derived</b> it, <b>as</b> there are many elements common to an oath on a deposit and misuse of consecrated property represented by the mnemonic: <b>Misuse, with regard to all, derive benefit, with fixed, one-fifth, and guilt-offering.</b> The term misuse is employed in both cases. Both cases are relevant with regard to all individuals and not only those fit to testify. Both involve one deriving benefit from property that is not his. In both cases, one is liable to bring a fixed guilt-offering, as opposed to one who takes a false oath of testimony, who is liable to bring a sliding-scale offering. In both cases, one adds one-fifth to the payment of the principal. In both cases, that is the offering with which one gains atonement.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>On the contrary, he should have derived</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an oath on a deposit <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of an oath of <b>testimony, as</b> there are many elements common to both oaths represented by the mnemonic: <b>Sin, ordinary</b> [<b><i>hedyot</i></b>], <b>with an oath, claimed</b> from <b>him, denied his</b> claim, <b>and</b> multiple instances of the term <b>“or.”</b> The term “shall sin” is written in both contexts. Both oaths relate to the property of ordinary individuals, not to consecrated property. In both cases there is a claim presented by one of the parties and denial of that claim by the one taking the oath. Multiple instances of the term “or” appear in both passages in the Torah. The Gemara responds: <b>These</b> elements common to an oath on a deposit and misuse of consecrated property are more <b>numerous</b> than the elements common to an oath on a deposit and an oath of testimony.
<b>Rather,</b> after resolving all the difficulties that were raised against the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, the question remains: <b>What</b> did the Sages of Eretz Yisrael find that is worthy of <b>mockery</b> in that <i>baraita</i>?
<b>When Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, came from the study hall of</b> their <b>teacher, they said: This is</b> what is worthy of <b>mockery: Now,</b> since ultimately <b>Rabbi Shimon derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> by means of <b>a verbal analogy</b> between the term “shall sin” written with regard to an oath on a deposit and the term “shall sin” written with regard to an oath of testimony, <b>why</b> is it <b>that he refutes</b> the parallel between them by saying: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the case of <b>a deposit?</b> It is notable in <b>that with regard to</b> a deposit the Torah <b>did not render</b> the halakhic status of <b>one to whom an oath was administered</b> by others <b>like</b> that of <b>one who</b> himself <b>took an oath,</b> as one to whom an oath was administered by others is exempt; and the Torah did not render the halakhic status of one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath <b>like</b> that of one who takes <b>an unwitting</b> false oath. Rabbi Shimon should have derived by means of the verbal analogy that all the <i>halakhot</i> of an oath of testimony and all the <i>halakhot</i> of an oath on a deposit are identical.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>And what</b> is worthy of <b>mockery</b> in that statement? <b>Perhaps when</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>refuted</b> the parallel between the two oaths, it was <b>prior to the verbal analogy being established for him,</b> and the derivation was by means of a paradigm. <b>After the verbal analogy was established for him, he does not refute</b> the parallel and holds that in the case of an oath on a deposit one is liable to bring a guilt-offering for false oaths administered by others as well as for intentional false oaths.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does Rabbi Shimon <b>not</b> refute the parallel between the two oaths? <b>But didn’t Rava bar Ittai say to the Sages: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> with regard to <b>an oath on a deposit</b> that <b>atonement</b> by means of an offering <b>is not possible</b> for one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath? <b>It is Rabbi Shimon.</b> Apparently, Rabbi Shimon concludes that there remains a distinction between intentional and unwitting in the case of an oath on a deposit.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Perhaps</b> with regard to the halakhic status of one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath being <b>like</b> that of one who takes <b>an unwitting</b> false oath, Rabbi Shimon <b>refutes</b> the parallel between the two oaths even after the verbal analogy is established for him, <b>as he derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of an oath on a deposit <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, where there is a distinction between intentional and unwitting, <b>as those</b> elements common to an oath on a deposit and the misuse of consecrated property are more <b>numerous</b> than the elements common to an oath on a deposit and an oath of testimony. <b>But he does not refute</b> the parallel between the two oaths with the claim that there is a distinction between them with regard to whether the halakhic status of <b>one to whom an oath was administered</b> by others is <b>like</b> that of <b>one who</b> himself <b>took an oath.</b> Once the verbal analogy was established for him, there is no longer a distinction between the two oaths in that regard.
The Gemara asks: If, according to Rabbi Shimon, based on the derivation from the misuse of consecrated property, one who intentionally takes a false oath on a deposit does not bring a guilt-offering like one who took the false oath unwittingly, <b>let</b> the discussion of the case of an oath of <b>testimony return</b> to the verbal analogy <b>and derive it from</b> the case of an oath on <b>a deposit that</b> the halakhic status of one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath <b>is not like</b> that of one who takes <b>an unwitting</b> false oath. <b>Just as</b> in the case of an oath on <b>a deposit,</b> one who takes <b>an unwitting</b> false oath, <b>yes,</b> he is liable to bring a guilt-offering, and one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath, <b>no,</b> he is not liable, <b>so too,</b> in the case of an oath of <b>testimony,</b> one who takes <b>an unwitting</b> false oath, <b>yes,</b> he is liable to bring a sin-offering, and one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath, <b>no,</b> he is not liable, <b>just as he derives</b> the case of an oath on <b>a deposit from</b> the case of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property.

Daf 35a

The Gemara answers: <b>For that</b> reason, <b>the Merciful One writes</b> the verse with regard to an oath of <b>testimony near</b> the verse with regard to <b>an oath on an utterance and near</b> the verse with regard to <b>the defiling of</b> the <b>Temple or its sacrificial</b> foods, <b>as in all of</b> those passages <b>it is stated concerning them: “And it is hidden,” and here,</b> with regard to an oath of testimony, <b>it is not stated concerning them: And it is hidden.</b> The Torah did so to underscore the contrast between them and <b>to deem liable</b> one who takes <b>an intentional</b> false oath of testimony <b>like</b> one who takes <b>an unwitting</b> false oath of testimony.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one said to witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your refusal to testify <b>if you do not come and testify on my behalf that so-and-so said</b> he is going <b>to give me two hundred dinars and he did not give</b> them to me, and they take false oaths that they have no knowledge of the matter, <b>they are exempt</b> from liability to bring an offering for taking a false oath of testimony, <b>as one is liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony <b>only</b> in a case involving <b>a monetary claim like a deposit</b> in the sense that were the witnesses to testify, the individual would be liable to pay. In the case of a promise to give a gift he could claim that he merely reconsidered.
If one said to witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you that when you will know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf, these</b> witnesses <b>are exempt</b> from liability for taking a false oath of testimony even if they do not testify, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that the oath preceded</b> their knowledge of the relevant <b>testimony.</b>
If one <b>stood in the synagogue and said</b> for all to hear: <b>I administer an oath to you that if you know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf, these</b> witnesses <b>are exempt until he directs</b> his demand <b>to</b> specific individuals.
If <b>one said to two</b> people: <b>I administer an oath to you, so-and-so and so-and-so, that if you know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf,</b> and they respond: On our <b>oath we do not know</b> any <b>testimony</b> relevant <b>to you, and they know testimony</b> relevant <b>to him,</b> not based on an incident they witnessed but based on <b>hearsay testimony,</b> which is not valid testimony, <b>or</b> if <b>one of</b> the witnesses <b>is found</b> to be <b>a relative or disqualified, these</b> witnesses <b>are exempt</b> from liability for taking a false oath of testimony because they are unfit witnesses.
If the plaintiff <b>sent</b> the demand for their testimony <b>by means of his slave, or</b> in a case <b>where the defendant said to</b> the witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you that if you know</b> any <b>testimony</b> relevant <b>to</b> the plaintiff <b>that you will come and testify on his behalf,</b> and they took a false oath that they have no knowledge of the matter, <b>these</b> witnesses <b>are exempt</b> from liability for taking a false oath of testimony <b>until they will hear</b> the demand to testify directly <b>from the mouth of the plaintiff.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites proof for the <i>halakhot</i> in the mishna from verses in the Torah. <b>The Sages taught: I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your refusal to testify <b>if you do not come and testify on my behalf that so-and-so said</b> that he is going <b>to give me two hundred dinars and he did not give</b> them to me; in such a case one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be liable.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states</b> the term <b>“shall sin”</b> with regard to an oath of testimony and <b>“shall sin”</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit in order <b>to</b> derive <b>a verbal analogy.</b>
<b>Here, it is stated</b> with regard to an oath of testimony <b>“shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and there, it is stated</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit <b>“shall sin”</b> (Leviticus 5:21). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to an oath on a deposit, the verse is speaking only <b>with regard to a monetary claim and</b> in a case where the plaintiff <b>has</b> a legitimate claim, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to an oath of testimony, the verse is speaking only <b>with regard to a monetary claim and</b> in a case where the plaintiff <b>has</b> a legitimate claim. In the case cited in the <i>baraita</i> and in the first clause of the mishna, the plaintiff does not have a legitimate claim.
The mishna teaches: <b>I administer an oath to you that when you will know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me</b> you will come and testify on my behalf.
<b>The Sages taught: I administer an oath to you that when you will know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf;</b> in such a case one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be liable.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he heard the voice of an oath and he is a witness or he saw or he knew”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). One is liable to bring an offering for a false oath only in a case <b>where</b> knowledge of the <b>testimony preceded the oath, and not</b> in a case <b>where the oath preceded</b> knowledge of the <b>testimony.</b>
The mishna continues: If one <b>stood in the synagogue and said</b> for all to hear: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> that if you know testimony relevant to me you will come and testify on my behalf, these witnesses are exempt. <b>Shmuel says:</b> That is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if <b>his witnesses</b> were <b>among the</b> people in the synagogue.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> Otherwise, there would be no novel element in this <i>halakha</i> of the mishna. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to cite this case only in a situation <b>where he is standing</b> right <b>next to</b> those witnesses. <b>Lest you say he is comparable to one who spoke to them</b> directly and those witnesses would be liable, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that until he specifies to whom he is directing his demand, he does not render those witnesses obligated to take an oath of testimony.
The Gemara notes: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one saw a group of people standing, and his witnesses</b> were <b>among them, and he said to</b> the entire group: <b>I administer an oath to you that if you know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf,</b> in such a case one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be liable. The verse states: “And he is a witness”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and</b> in this case <b>he did not specify his witnesses;</b> therefore, they are not liable. One <b>might</b> have thought that the <i>halakha</i> is the same <b>even</b> if <b>he said:</b> I administer an oath to <b>everyone who is standing here</b> that you will come and testify on my behalf. <b>The verse states: “And he is a witness”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), <b>and</b> in this case, although he spoke to a group, <b>he specified his witnesses;</b> therefore, they are liable.
The mishna teaches that if <b>one said to two</b> individuals: <b>I administer an oath to you,</b> and they know testimony relevant to him based on hearsay, or if one of the witnesses is found to be a relative or disqualified, they are exempt. The Gemara cites that which <b>the Sages taught:</b> If <b>one said to two</b> individuals: <b>I administer an oath to you, so-and-so and so-and-so,</b> that <b>if you know testimony</b> relevant <b>to me you will come and testify on my behalf, and they know testimony</b> relevant <b>to him</b> based on <b>hearsay testimony, or</b> if <b>one of</b> the witnesses is <b>a relative or disqualified,</b> in such a case one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>they would be liable. The verse states: “If he does not state it, then he shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), teaching that it is <b>with regard to</b> those <b>eligible for</b> the <b>statement</b> of testimony that <b>the verse is speaking,</b> not those who are ineligible.
The mishna teaches: If the plaintiff <b>sent</b> the demand for their testimony <b>by means of his slave, etc. The Sages taught:</b> If the plaintiff <b>sent</b> the demand for their testimony <b>by means of his slave, or</b> in a case <b>where the defendant said to</b> the witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you that if you know</b> any <b>testimony</b> relevant <b>to</b> the plaintiff <b>that you will come and testify on his behalf, might</b> one have thought that <b>they would be liable? The verse states: “If he does not state it, then he shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:1); therefore, they are not liable.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> biblical <b>derivation</b> that leads to that conclusion? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The derivation is based on the fact that it <b>is written: <i>Im lo yaggid</i>.</b> In the verse the word <i>lo</i> is spelled <i>lamed</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>alef</i> and interpreted as both “not,” spelled <i>lamed alef</i>, and “to him,” spelled <i>lamed vav</i>. It is derived: <b>If</b> the witness who knows the testimony <b>does not state</b> it <b>to</b> the plaintiff, <b>he shall bear his iniquity,</b> and he is liable; <b>but if he does not state</b> it <b>to another,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna discusses the formula of an oath of testimony. If the plaintiff said to the witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your refusal to testify if you do not come and testify on my behalf, or even if he said: <b>I command you,</b> or <b>I bind you,</b> although he did not employ an unequivocal formula of an oath, <b>these</b> witnesses <b>are liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony.
If one administered the oath to the witnesses <b>in the</b> name of <b>heaven and in the</b> name of <b>earth, these</b> witnesses are <b>exempt</b> from liability for taking a false oath of testimony, as that is not an oath in the name of God. If one administered the oath to the witnesses <b>in</b> the name of <b><i>alef dalet</i>,</b> i.e., <i>Adonai</i>; <b>in</b> the name of <b><i>yod heh</i>,</b> the Tetragrammaton; <b>in</b> the name of the <b>Almighty [<i>Shaddai</i>]; in</b> the name of the Lord of <b>Hosts [<i>Tzevaot</i>]; in</b> the name of the <b>Gracious and Compassionate</b> One; <b>in</b> the name of He Who is <b>Slow to Anger; in</b> the name of He Who is <b>Abounding in Loving-kindness; or in</b> the name of <b>any of the appellations</b> of God, even though he did not mention the ineffable name of God, <b>these</b> witnesses are <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony.
<b>One who curses</b> God <b>employing any of</b> these names or appellations of God is <b>liable</b> to be executed through stoning; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt,</b> as they hold that one is liable for cursing God only if he employs the ineffable name of God.
<b>One who curses his father or his mother employing any of</b> these names or appellations of God is <b>liable</b> to be executed through stoning; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt,</b> as they hold that one is liable for cursing his father and his mother only if he employs the ineffable name of God.
<b>One who curses himself or another employing any of</b> these names or appellations of God <b>violates a prohibition.</b> If one says: <b>The Lord God shall strike you</b> (see Deuteronomy 28:22), <b>and likewise</b> if one says: <b>God shall strike you</b> if you do not come to testify, <b>that is a curse that is written in the Torah,</b> and in such a case one is certainly liable if he fails to testify.
If one says to the witnesses: God <b>shall not strike you, or:</b> God <b>shall bless you, or:</b> God <b>shall benefit you</b> if you come and testify, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> him <b>liable,</b> as one may infer from that statement that if he fails to testify God will strike him, or will not bless or benefit him. <b>And the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> because the curse is not explicitly stated.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if the plaintiff said to the witnesses: <b>I administer an oath to you,</b> I command you, or I bind you, these witnesses are liable for taking a false oath of testimony. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the plaintiff <b>saying?</b> He merely said that he is administering an oath, but he did not say in the name of what he is administering the oath. <b>Rav Yehuda said: This</b> is what the plaintiff <b>is saying: I administer an oath to you with the oath mentioned in the Torah, I command you with the command mentioned in the Torah, I bind you with the bond mentioned in the Torah,</b> and in the Torah all of these include mention of the name of God.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yehuda: <b>But</b> according to that interpretation, concerning <b>that which Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches,</b> that if the plaintiff said to the witnesses: <b>I chain you, these</b> witnesses are <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony, <b>is chaining written in the Torah?</b> Apparently, the reference in the mishna and the <i>baraita</i> is not to similar language in the Torah.
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the plaintiff <b>is saying: I administer an oath to you with an oath, I command you with an oath, I bind you with an oath, I chain you with an oath.</b> The witnesses are liable in all these cases provided that the plaintiff mentions an oath.
§ The mishna teaches: If one administered the oath to the witnesses <b>in</b> the name of <b><i>alef dalet</i>, in</b> the name of <b><i>yod heh</i>, in</b> the name of the <b>Almighty [<i>Shaddai</i>], in</b> the name of the Lord of <b>Hosts [<i>Tzevaot</i>], in</b> the name of the <b>Gracious and Compassionate</b> One, <b>in</b> the name of He Who is <b>Slow to Anger,</b> or <b>in</b> the name of He Who is <b>Abounding in Loving-kindness,</b> these witnesses are liable for taking a false oath of testimony.
Is that <b>to say that gracious and compassionate are</b> sacred <b>names?</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There are names</b> of God <b>that may be erased and there are names</b> of God <b>that may not be erased</b> due to their inherent sanctity. <b>These are names that may not be erased: For example,</b> several variations of the name God [<i>Elohim</i>]: <b><i>El</i>, <i>Elohekha</i></b> with a second person singular suffix, <b><i>Elohim</i>, <i>Eloheikhem</i></b> with a second person plural suffix; <b>I Shall Be As I Shall Be, <i>alef dalet</i>, <i>yod heh</i>, Almighty [<i>Shaddai</i>],</b> Lord of <b>Hosts [<i>Tzevaot</i>], these</b> names <b>may not be erased.</b>
<b>But</b> adjectives that describe the Holy One, Blessed be He, e.g., <b>the Great, the Mighty, the Awesome, the Prodigious, the Powerful, the Courageous, the Strong, gracious, compassionate, slow to anger, or abounding in loving-kindness; these may be erased.</b> Apparently, gracious and compassionate are adjectives and not actual names of God; how, then, does an oath or a curse in the name of gracious and compassionate take effect?
<b>Abaye said:</b> In <b>the mishna,</b> it is with regard to one who administers an oath or curses <b>in</b> the name of <b>He Who is Gracious,</b>

Daf 35b

or <b>in</b> the name of <b>He Who is compassionate,</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>is stating</b> the <i>halakha</i>. Although gracious and compassionate are not names of God, the reference in the mishna is to an oath in the name of God.
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>If so,</b> in the case of one who administered the oath to the witnesses <b>in the</b> name of <b>heaven and in the</b> name of <b>earth as well,</b> say that it is with regard to an oath <b>in</b> the name of <b>He for Whom the heaven and the earth are His</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>is stating</b> the <i>halakha</i>. Why, then, does the mishna say that for an oath in the name of heaven and in the name of earth, these witnesses are exempt from liability?
The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, since there is no other entity that is called gracious and compassionate, certainly</b> it is <b>in</b> the name of <b>He Who is gracious,</b> and <b>certainly</b> it is <b>in</b> the name of <b>He Who is compassionate</b> that the <i>tanna</i> <b>is speaking.</b> By contrast, <b>here, since there are heaven and earth</b> that exist as independent entities, perhaps when he administers an oath in the name of heaven and in the name of earth, it is <b>in the</b> name of the actual <b>heaven and in the</b> name of the actual <b>earth</b> that <b>he is speaking,</b> and not in the name of He for Whom the heaven and the earth are His.
§ Apropos the names of God that may be erased and those that may not be erased, the Gemara discusses the details of the matter. <b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>one wrote</b> the letters <b><i>alef lamed</i> from</b> the name <b><i>Elohim</i>,</b> or <b><i>yod heh</i> from the Tetragrammaton, this</b> pair of letters and that pair of letters <b>may not be erased.</b> But if one wrote the letters <b><i>shin dalet</i> from <i>Shaddai</i>,</b> or <b><i>alef dalet</i> from <i>Adonai</i>,</b> or <b><i>tzadi beit</i> from <i>Tzevaot</i>, this may be erased.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The word <b><i>tzevaot</i> may be erased</b> in <b>its entirety, as</b> God <b>is called <i>Tzevaot</i> only in the context of</b> the children of <b>Israel,</b> and it is not an independent name of God, <b>as it is stated: “And I shall bring forth My hosts [<i>tzivotai</i>], My people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt”</b> (Exodus 7:4). <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>
<b>The Sages taught: Any</b> letters <b>ancillary to the name</b> of God, <b>whether</b> as a prefix <b>preceding</b> the name <b>or</b> as a suffix <b>succeeding</b> the name, <b>this</b> addition <b>may be erased. Preceding it, how so?</b> If one wrote the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>lamed</i>,</b> meaning: To the Lord, the <b><i>lamed</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>beit</i>,</b> meaning: By the Lord, the <b><i>beit</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>vav</i>,</b> meaning: And the Lord, the <b><i>vav</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>mem</i>,</b> meaning: From the Lord, the <b><i>mem</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>shin</i>,</b> meaning: That the Lord, the <b><i>shin</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>heh</i>,</b> meaning: Is the Lord, the <b><i>heh</i> may be erased;</b> the <b>Tetragrammaton</b> with the prefix <b><i>kaf</i>,</b> meaning: Like the Lord, the <b><i>kaf</i> may be erased.</b>
<b>Succeeding it, how so?</b> If one wrote <b><i>Eloheinu</i>,</b> meaning: Our God, the <b><i>nun vav</i></b> suffix <b>may be erased; <i>Eloheihem</i>,</b> meaning: Their God, the <b><i>heh mem</i></b> suffix <b>may be erased; <i>Eloheikhem</i>,</b> meaning: Your God, second person plural, the <b><i>kaf mem</i></b> suffix <b>may be erased. <i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> The suffix <b>succeeding</b> the name of God <b>may not be erased as the name</b> of God to which it is appended <b>already sanctified it</b> and it is considered as though it is part of the name. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>.</b>
§ <b>Abraham; who cursed Naboth; in Gibeah of Benjamin; Solomon; Daniel;</b> this is <b>a mnemonic</b> for the <i>halakhot</i> that follow.
<b>All names</b> that could be understood as the name of God <b>that are stated in the Torah with regard to Abraham</b> are <b>sacred</b> and are referring to God, <b>except for this</b> name, <b>which is non-sacred, as it is stated: “My lords, if I have found favor in your eyes”</b> (Genesis 18:3). In that passage, Abraham is addressing the angels who appeared to him in the guise of men, not God.
<b>Ḥanina, son of the brother of Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya in the name of Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i, say: This too</b> is <b>sacred.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Hospitality</b> accorded to <b>guests is greater than receiving the Divine Presence? In accordance with whose</b> opinion is that statement? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that pair</b> of <i>tanna’im</i>, Ḥanina, son of the brother of Rabbi Yehoshua, and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, who understood that Abraham was speaking to God.
<b>All names</b> that could be understood as the name of God <b>that are stated</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to Lot</b> are <b>non-sacred</b> and are referring to angels, <b>except for this</b> one, <b>which is sacred, as it is stated: “And Lot said to them: Please, not so <i>Adonai</i>. Behold your servant has found favor in your eyes,</b> and you have magnified Your mercy that You have performed for me by saving my life” (Genesis 19:18–19). It is apparent from the context that Lot is addressing <b>He Who has the capacity to kill and to vivify; that is the Holy One, Blessed be He.</b>
<b>All names that are stated with regard to Naboth</b> are <b>sacred,</b> e.g., in the verse: “Naboth blasphemed <i>Elohim</i> and the king” (I Kings 21:13), and those stated <b>with regard to Micah</b> are <b>non-sacred</b> and are referring to the graven image that he fashioned (see Judges, chapters 17–18). <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> Indeed, all names that are stated <b>with regard to Naboth</b> are <b>sacred;</b> but those stated <b>with regard to Micah, some of them are non-sacred and some of them are sacred.</b> The names beginning with the letters <b><i>alef lamed</i>,</b> i.e., <i>Elohim</i>, are <b>non-sacred,</b> as the reference is to the idol that he crafted, and all the names beginning with the letters <b><i>yod heh</i>,</b> i.e., the Tetragrammaton, are <b>sacred, except for this</b> name that begins with the letters <b><i>alef lamed</i> and it is sacred: “All the time that the house of <i>Elohim</i> was in Shiloh”</b> (Judges 18:31).
<b>All names that are stated in</b> the passage concerning <b>Gibeah of Benjamin,</b> where the rest of the tribes consulted God to determine whether they should go to war against the tribe of Benjamin (see Judges, chapter 20), <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> They are <b>non-sacred,</b> as they were consulting an idol, not God. <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> They are <b>sacred.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to</b> Rabbi Yehoshua: How can you say that those names are sacred? <b>Does</b> God <b>promise and not fulfill</b> the promise? Twice the tribes received the response to go to war against Benjamin, and twice they were vanquished.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: <b>That which</b> God <b>promised, He fulfilled.</b> In each case, He responded to their question. The first time they consulted God through the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, <b>but they did not seek to ascertain if</b> they are <b>to triumph</b> in the war or <b>if</b> they are <b>to be defeated. In the last</b> time that they consulted God through the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, <b>where they sought to ascertain</b> whether they would emerge triumphant, <b>they consented</b> in Heaven <b>to their</b> endeavor, <b>as it is stated: “And Pinehas, son of Elazar, son of Aaron was standing before it in those days, saying: Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?</b> And the Lord said: Go up, as tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand” (Judges 20:28).
<b>All</b> mentions of the name <b>Shlomo that are stated in the Song of Songs,</b> such as: “The song of songs that is Shlomo’s” (Song of Songs 1:1), are not references to King Solomon; rather, they are <b>sacred,</b> meaning <b>a song to</b> the <b>One for Whom peace [<i>shehashalom</i>] is His, except for this</b> mention: <b>“My vineyard, which is mine, is before me; you, Solomon shall have the one thousand,”</b> i.e., one thousand are <b>for Solomon himself; “and two hundred for those who guard its fruit”</b> (Song of Songs 8:12), which is a reference to <b>the Sages. And some say: This</b> verse <b>too is non-sacred: “Behold, the bed of Solomon; sixty</b> mighty men are around it” (Song of Songs 3:7).
The Gemara asks: Does this mean: <b>This</b> verse <b>too</b> is non-sacred, <b>and it is not necessary</b> to say that the verse cited earlier is non-sacred? <b>But that which Shmuel says: A monarchy that kills one of</b> every <b>six</b> individuals <b>in the world is not punished</b> for doing so, as that is the prerogative of a monarch, <b>as it is stated: “My vineyard, which is mine, is before me; you, Shlomo shall have the one thousand,”</b> this is a reference <b>to the monarchy of Heaven; “and two hundred for those who guard its fruit,”</b> this is a reference <b>to the monarchy of earth.</b> Of the 1,200 mentioned in the two parts of the verse, two hundred, or one-sixth, are the prerogative of the earthly monarch. <b>Shmuel,</b> who interprets the mention of Shlomo in this verse as referring to God, holds <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i> nor in accordance with</b> the opinion introduced with the term: <b>Some say.</b> Both <i>tanna’im</i> agree that the reference in the verse is to Solomon and not to the Holy One, Blessed be He.
<b>Rather,</b> Shmuel cites a different version of the opinion introduced with the term: Some say, according to which <b>this</b> is what <b>it is saying. And some say: This</b> Shlomo that appears in the verse with regard to the one thousand is <b>sacred, and that</b> Shlomo that appears in the verse <b>with regard to the bed of</b> Solomon <b>is non-sacred, and</b> it is <b>Shmuel who states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion introduced with the term: <b>Some say.</b>
<b>All kings that are stated with regard to Daniel</b> are <b>non-sacred, except for this</b> one, <b>which is sacred: “You, O king, king of kings, unto whom the God of heaven has given you the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory”</b> (Daniel 2:37).
<b>And some say: This too</b> is <b>sacred, as it is stated: “My Lord, the dream shall be for your enemy and its interpretation for your foe”</b> (Daniel 4:16). <b>To whom is</b> Daniel <b>saying</b> this? <b>If it enters your mind</b> that when Daniel says: “My lord,” it is <b>to Nebuchadnezzar</b> that <b>he is saying it, his enemy, who are they?</b> They are the <b>Jewish people. Would</b> Daniel <b>curse the Jewish people?</b>
<b>And the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who understands that Daniel is referring to Nebuchadnezzar, <b>holds: Are there Jewish enemies</b> for Nebuchadnezzar and <b>there are no gentile enemies</b> for him? Daniel was cursing the gentile enemies, not the Jewish enemies.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Or</b> if one administered the oath to the witnesses <b>in</b> the name of <b>any of the appellations</b> of God, even though he did not mention the ineffable name of God, <b>these</b> witnesses are <b>liable</b> for taking a false oath of testimony.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that cites the verse: <b>“The Lord shall render you as a curse and as an oath”</b> (Numbers 5:21). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>Isn’t it already stated</b> at the beginning of the verse: <b>“And the priest shall administer to the woman with the oath of cursing”? Due to</b> the fact <b>that it is stated</b> with regard to an oath of testimony: <b>“And he heard the voice of an <i>ala</i>”</b> (Leviticus 5:1), one may infer: <b><i>Ala</i> is stated here</b> with regard to an oath of testimony <b>and <i>ala</i> is stated there</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>; <b>just as there,</b> with regard to a <i>sota</i>, the reference is to <b>an oath, so too here,</b> with regard to an oath of testimony, the reference is to <b>an oath.</b> And <b>just as there,</b> the oath is administered <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God, <b>so too here,</b> the oath is administered <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God. This is contrary to the mishna, where the ruling is that an oath of testimony may be administered even in the name of appellations of God.
<b>Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Idi,</b> and <b>that</b> mishna is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Idi says: Since the Torah says</b> in some cases: <b>Take an oath, and</b> in some cases: <b>Do not take an oath;</b> and it says in some cases: <b>Curse, and</b> in some cases: <b>Do not curse, just as</b> when the Torah says: <b>Take an oath,</b> it is <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God, <b>so too,</b> when the Torah states: <b>Do not take an oath,</b> it is <b>in the name</b> of God. And <b>just as</b> when the Torah states: <b>Curse,</b> it is <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God, <b>so too,</b> when the Torah says: <b>Do not curse,</b> it is <b>in</b> the <b>name</b> of God.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the Rabbis</b> say: <b>If they derive</b> an oath of testimony from <i>sota</i> by means of <b>a verbal analogy, let us require</b> that both an oath of testimony and the curse will be specifically in <b>the ineffable name</b> of God. <b>If they do not derive</b> an oath of testimony from <i>sota</i> by means of <b>a verbal analogy, from where do they</b> derive <b>that</b> the instance of the word <b><i>ala</i> that</b> is written with regard to an oath of testimony <b>is an oath?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to an oath of testimony: “And he hears the voice of <b>an <i>ala</i>”</b> (Leviticus 5:1); <b><i>ala</i> is nothing other than an expression</b> meaning <b>oath. And likewise it says: “And the priest shall administer to the woman with the oath of cursing [<i>ha’ala</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:21).
The Gemara asks: It is not merely <i>ala</i> that is written there; <b>the oath of an <i>ala</i> is written there.</b> Apparently, <i>ala</i> alone does not mean oath. The Gemara explains that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b> “And he hears the voice of <b>an <i>ala</i>”; <i>ala</i> is</b> used <b>only</b> when accompanied <b>by an oath. And likewise it says: “And the priest shall administer to the woman with the oath of cursing.”</b>

Daf 36a

<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>to render an <i>ala</i> with which</b> the word <b>oath is not</b> written <b>like an <i>ala</i> with which</b> the word <b>oath is</b> written <b>and an oath with which</b> the word <b><i>ala</i> is not</b> written <b>like an oath with which</b> the word <b><i>ala</i> is</b> written? <b>The verse states: “And he hears the voice of an <i>ala</i>”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). The phrase “the voice of an <i>ala</i>” is unnecessary, as it would have been sufficient to write: And he heard an <i>ala</i>. It is interpreted as though it were written: <b>And he heard an <i>ala</i> and he heard a voice.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abbahu says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to <i>ala</i> that it is an oath?</b> It is derived <b>as it is stated:</b> “And he took from the seed of the monarchy…<b>and brought it into an <i>ala</i>”</b> (Ezekiel 17:13); <b>and it is stated</b> with regard to Zedekiah, who was from the seed of the monarchy: <b>“And he also rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar who had administered an oath to him by God”</b> (II Chronicles 36:13). This indicates that the <i>ala</i> is an oath.
§ The Gemara proceeds to define a related term. It is <b>taught</b> with regard to the term <b><i>arur</i>:</b> There is an element of <b>ostracism within it,</b> there is an element of <b>curse within it,</b> and there is an element of <b>oath within it.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: There is an element of <b>ostracism within it, as it is written</b> in the song of Deborah: <b>“Curse [<i>oru</i>] Meroz, said the angel of God; cursed with a curse [<i>oru aror</i>] are its inhabitants”</b> (Judges 5:23). <b>And Ulla says: With</b> blasts from <b>four hundred <i>shofarot</i>, Barak ostracized</b> the city of <b>Meroz,</b> indicating that the term <i>arur</i> has the connotation of ostracism.
There is an element of <b>curse within it, as it is written</b> with regard to the ceremony at Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal: <b>“And these shall stand for the curse”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:13), <b>and it is written: “Cursed [<i>arur</i>] be the man who fashions a graven image,</b> an abomination to the Lord, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and sets it up in secret. And all the people shall answer and say: Amen” (Deuteronomy 27:15).
There is an element of <b>oath within it, as it is written: “And Joshua administered an oath at that time saying: <i>Arur</i> be the man before God</b> who shall arise and rebuild this city, Jericho” (Joshua 6:26). The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> Joshua <b>performed two</b> actions <b>to</b> the people; <b>he administered an oath to them and he cursed them,</b> and the term <i>arur</i> relates to the curse, not to the oath.
<b>Rather,</b> the fact that there is an element of oath in the term <i>arur</i> is derived <b>from here: “And the men of Israel were distressed on that day, and Saul administered an oath [<i>vayyoel</i>] to the people, saying: <i>Arur</i> is the man who eats</b> bread until the evening and I will be avenged on my enemies” (I Samuel 14:24). <b>And it is written: “But Jonathan did not hear when his father administered the oath to the people”</b> (I Samuel 14:27). The Gemara challenges: <b>But perhaps, here too,</b> Saul <b>performed two</b> actions <b>to</b> the people; <b>he administered an oath to them and he cursed them.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Is it written</b> in that context <b><i>ve’arur</i>,</b> with a conjunctional prefix, which would indicate that <i>arur</i> is independent of the oath that was administered? <i>Arur</i> is written without a prefix, indicating that it is an intrinsic part of the oath. The Gemara notes: <b>Now that you have arrived at this</b> insight, <b>there too,</b> in the context of Joshua, <b><i>ve’arur</i></b> with a conjunctional prefix <b>is not written,</b> indicating that <i>arur</i> is an intrinsic part of the oath.
§ <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says</b> with regard to the term <b>amen:</b> There is an element of <b>oath within it,</b> there is an element of <b>acceptance of the statement</b> and agreement <b>within it,</b> and there is an element of <b>confirmation of the statement,</b> i.e., that he believes and prays that the statement will be fulfilled, <b>within it.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: There is an element of <b>oath within it, as it is written:</b> “And the priest shall administer an oath to the woman…<b>and the woman shall say: Amen, amen”</b> (Numbers 5:21–22). “Amen” is the oath that the woman takes.
There is an element of <b>acceptance of the statement within it, as it is written: “Cursed is he who shall not confirm the matters of this Torah to perform them; and all the people shall say: Amen”</b> (Deuteronomy 27:26), expressing their agreement to fulfill all the matters of the Torah.
There is an element of <b>confirmation of the statement within it, as it is written: “And Jeremiah the prophet said: Amen, may the Lord do so; may the Lord uphold your statement”</b> (Jeremiah 28:6).
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar says: No,</b> or any negative expression, can be <b>an oath,</b> and <b>yes,</b> or any positive expression, can be <b>an oath.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>Granted</b> that <b>no</b> can be <b>an oath, as it is written: “And the waters shall no more become a flood”</b> (Genesis 9:15). <b>And it is written</b> with regard to that negative commitment: <b>“As this is as the waters of Noah unto Me; as I have taken an oath</b> that the waters of Noah shall no more pass over the earth” (Isaiah 54:9). <b>But from where do we</b> derive the fact that <b>yes</b> can be <b>an oath?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning; from</b> the fact <b>that no</b> can be <b>an oath, yes too</b> can be <b>an oath.</b>
<b>Rava said: And</b> a negative expression <b>is</b> an oath only in a case <b>where one said no, no,</b> stating the term <b>two times, or</b> it is in a case <b>where one said yes, yes,</b> stating the term <b>two times, as it is written: “All flesh shall not be excised any more by floodwaters”</b> (Genesis 9:11), and it is again written: <b>“And the waters shall no more become a flood”</b> (Genesis 9:15). <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that no</b> is an oath only when stated <b>two times, yes, too,</b> is an oath only when stated <b>two times.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One who curses</b> God <b>employing any of</b> these names or appellations of God is <b>liable</b> to be executed; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> that it is written: <b>“Each and every man who shall curse his God shall bear his sin”</b> (Leviticus 24:15). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> this? <b>Wasn’t it already stated: “And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:16)? One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>one would be liable only for</b> cursing <b>the ineffable name</b> of God <b>alone. From where</b> is it derived <b>to include</b> liability for one who curses <b>the appellations</b> of God? It is derived as <b>the verse states: “Each and every man who shall curse his God,”</b> indicating that one is liable <b>in any case,</b> even for cursing an appellation. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. The Rabbis say: For</b> cursing <b>the ineffable name</b> of God, one is liable to be executed <b>with</b> a court-imposed <b>death</b> penalty, as it is stated explicitly in the verse. <b>And for</b> cursing one of the <b>appellations</b> of God, one is liable <b>for</b> violating <b>a prohibition,</b> but he is not liable to be executed.
The mishna teaches: <b>And one who curses his father and his mother</b> employing any of these names or appellations of God is liable to be executed; this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis deem him exempt. The Gemara asks: <b>Who are the Rabbis</b> whose opinion is cited here?
The Gemara answers: It is <b>Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei says:</b> It is stated with regard to one who blasphemes God: <b>“When he blasphemes a name, he shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:16). <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state “a name,”</b> when it is stated at the beginning of the verse: “And he who blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death”? This extraneous word “name” <b>taught with regard to one who curses his father or his mother that he is not liable</b> to be executed through stoning <b>until he curses them in the name</b> of God.
The mishna teaches: <b>One who curses himself or another</b> employing any of these names or appellations of God violates a prohibition. <b>Rabbi Yannai says: And everyone agrees</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>. Even the Rabbis, who hold that one who blasphemes God or curses his parents is liable only if he employs the Tetragrammaton, agree here that one is liable to receive lashes when he curses employing an appellation.
The Gemara proceeds to cite sources for these prohibitions. The prohibition against cursing <b>oneself</b> is derived <b>as it is written: “Only observe for yourself, and keep your soul diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 4:9). This is <b>in accordance with</b> that <b>which Rabbi Avin says that Rabbi Ile’a says: Everywhere</b> in the Torah <b>that</b> the terms <b>observe, lest, or do not are stated, it is nothing other than a prohibition.</b> One who curses himself does not keep, i.e., take care of, himself and consequently violates the prohibition. <b>And</b> cursing <b>another</b> is derived <b>as it is written: “Do not curse the deaf”</b> (Leviticus 19:14), which applies to others just as it does to one who is deaf.
§ The mishna teaches that if one says: <b>The Lord God shall strike you</b> (see Deuteronomy 28:22), <b>and likewise</b> if one says: <b>God shall strike you</b> if you do not come to testify, <b>that is a curse that is written in the Torah.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Kahana sat before Rav Yehuda, and he sat and stated the mishna</b> verbatim <b>as we learned</b> it. Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: Employ a euphemism</b> and formulate it in the third person rather than the second person: God shall strike him instead of you, so that it will not sound as though you are cursing your teacher.
Likewise, the Gemara relates: <b>A certain one of the Sages sat before Rav Kahana, and he sat and said</b> the verse: <b>“God will likewise break you forever; He will take you up and pluck you from the tent, and uproot you from the land of the living, Selah”</b> (Psalms 52:7). Rav Kahana <b>said to him: Employ a euphemism</b> and formulate it in the third person rather than the second person, so that it will not sound as though you are cursing your teacher.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>two</b> incidents to relate the same concept? The Gemara answers: It was necessary to relate the second incident as well. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies only to <b>the mishna,</b> as in the Oral Torah, where the content, not the formulation, is significant, emending the text in the interest of euphemism is permitted; <b>but with regard to verses</b> in the Bible, where the formulation, i.e., each word, is significant, <b>say</b> that <b>we do not employ a euphemism.</b> Therefore, the Gemara <b>teaches us</b> that it is permitted to employ a euphemism even when reciting verses.
§ The mishna teaches that if one says to the witnesses: God <b>shall not strike you, or:</b> God <b>shall bless you, or:</b> God <b>shall benefit you</b> if you come and testify, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> him <b>liable,</b> as one may infer from that statement that if he fails to testify God will strike him, or will not bless or benefit him. <b>And the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt</b> because the curse is not explicitly stated.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> it so that <b>Rabbi Meir does not accept</b> the principle: <b>From a negative</b> statement <b>you</b> can <b>infer a positive</b> statement, and in an agreement, he requires the parties to explicitly state both the positive and the negative stipulations? The Gemara says: <b>Reverse</b> the attribution of the opinions and say that it is the Rabbis who hold that the witness is liable and it is Rabbi Meir who deems him exempt.
The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Yitzḥak came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he taught</b> the mishna <b>as we learned</b> it and did not reverse the attribution of the opinions. <b>Rav Yosef said: Now that we have learned</b> the mishna in <b>this</b> formulation, <b>and when he came, Rabbi Yitzḥak taught</b> the mishna in <b>this</b> formulation, <b>conclude from it</b> that the formulation that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna was taught <b>specifically</b> in that manner and that is the correct formulation.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the question remains <b>difficult,</b> as Rabbi Meir does not accept the principle: From a negative statement you can infer a positive statement. The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> Rabbi Meir <b>does not accept</b> that principle, it is only <b>in</b> cases involving <b>monetary matters; but in</b> cases involving <b>ritual matters,</b> e.g., an oath of testimony discussed in the mishna, <b>he accepts</b> the principle, and the witness is liable even in that case.
The Gemara asks: <b>But <i>sota</i> is</b> a case involving <b>ritual,</b> and not monetary <b>matters,</b> and the verse states only what will befall the <i>sota</i> if she did not commit adultery: “And if you did not go astray to defilement, while under your husband, you shall be absolved [<i>hinnaki</i>]” (Numbers 5:19), and the verse does not state what will befall the woman if she committed adultery.
A difficulty is raised: According to Rabbi Meir, who does not accept the principle: From a negative statement you can infer a positive statement, both the positive and the negative eventualities should have been written in the verse. <b>And Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥakhinai says</b> to resolve the difficulty: <b><i>Hinnaki</i> is written,</b> meaning: You shall be absolved. But since it is written without the letter <i>yod</i>, it is interpreted as though <i>ḥinnaki</i> is written, meaning: You shall be strangulated, which is the eventuality if she committed adultery. The Gemara concludes: <b>The reason</b> that this verse is not difficult is <b>that <i>hinnaki</i> is written</b> and <i>ḥinnaki</i> is interpreted; <b>but</b> if <b>that</b> were <b>not</b> the case, <b>we do not say: From a negative</b> statement <b>you</b> can <b>infer a positive</b> statement. Apparently, even in ritual matters, Rabbi Meir does not accept the principle.

Daf 36b

<b>Rather,</b> nevertheless, <b>reverse</b> the attribution of the opinions in the mishna and say that Rabbi Meir deems the witness exempt from liability for an oath of testimony, as <b>even in ritual matters,</b> Rabbi Meir <b>does not accept</b> the principle: From a negative statement you can infer a positive statement.
<b>Ravina objects to this: And in ritual matters,</b> does Rabbi Meir <b>not accept</b> the principle? <b>But if that is so,</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that priests who perform the Temple service while <b>intoxicated with wine, and</b> priests who perform the Temple service with <b>overgrown</b> hair on their <b>head, who,</b> based on this principle, are liable to receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven, <b>so too does Rabbi Meir not accept</b> this principle? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And these</b> are they <b>who</b> are liable <b>to</b> receive <b>death</b> at the hand of Heaven: Priests who perform the Temple service while <b>intoxicated with wine and</b> priests who perform the Temple service with <b>overgrown</b> hair on their <b>head,</b> and Rabbi Meir does not disagree with that ruling?
<b>Rather, actually reverse</b> the attribution of the opinions in the mishna and say that Rabbi Meir deems the witness exempt from liability for an oath of testimony. <b>When</b> Rabbi Meir <b>does not accept</b> that principle, it is only <b>in</b> cases involving <b>monetary matters; but in</b> cases involving <b>ritual matters, he accepts</b> the principle. That is the reason he does not dispute the <i>halakha</i> in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to a priest intoxicated with wine or with overgrown hair on his head. <b>And</b> the reason that he does not accept the principle: From a negative statement you can infer a positive statement, in the case of <i>sota</i> is that <b><i>sota</i> is different because it is a ritual matter in which there are</b> ramifications involving <b>monetary matters,</b> i.e., payment of the marriage contract. The same is true with regard to an oath of testimony in the mishna; although it is a ritual matter, it is a ritual matter with ramifications involving monetary matters.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who takes a false oath denying that he is in possession of an item that another deposited with him is liable to return the item with an additional one-fifth of its value and to bring a guilt-offering (see Leviticus 5:20–26). The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>an oath on a deposit apply to men and to women, to non-relatives and to relatives,</b> i.e., even if the owner of the deposit and the purported bailee are related, <b>to</b> those <b>fit</b> to serve as witnesses <b>and to</b> those <b>disqualified</b> from doing so.
These <i>halakhot</i> apply when the oath is taken <b>in the presence of a court and</b> when taken <b>not in the presence of a court,</b> as long as the oath is taken <b>on his own,</b> i.e., stated by the defendant himself. <b>But</b> if the oath is administered <b>by others,</b> he is <b>not liable unless he denies</b> the claim <b>in court;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say: Both</b> when the defendant takes an oath <b>on his own and</b> when the oath is administered <b>by others, once</b> he has falsely <b>denied</b> the claim against him, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a guilt-offering and to pay restitution and an additional one-fifth, even if the oath was not administered in the presence of a court.
<b>And</b> one is <b>liable</b> to bring an offering <b>for intentionally</b> taking a false <b>oath</b> on a deposit <b>and for unwittingly</b> taking a false oath about the <b>intentional</b> misappropriation of <b>the deposit,</b> i.e., if one knowingly took a false oath but was unaware that he is liable to bring an offering for taking the oath. <b>But he is not liable for unwittingly</b> taking a false oath <b>by itself,</b> where he mistakenly thought that he did not owe anything. <b>And what is he liable for</b> when he <b>intentionally</b> takes a false oath? He must bring <b>a guilt-offering worth</b> at least two <b>silver shekels.</b>
The mishna continues: <b>What</b> is the case of <b>an oath on a deposit?</b> It is where the claimant <b>said to</b> the defendant: <b>Give me my deposit, which is in your possession,</b> and the defendant replied: On my <b>oath nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession; or</b> the defendant <b>said to him: Nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession,</b> the claimant responded: <b>I administer an oath to you, and</b> the defendant <b>said: Amen.</b> In either case <b>this</b> defendant is <b>liable</b> to bring a guilt-offering if he lied.
If the claimant <b>administered an oath to him five times, whether in the presence of a court or not in the presence of a court, and</b> the defendant falsely <b>denied</b> each claim, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a guilt-offering <b>for each and every</b> denial. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: What is the reason?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he is able to retract and confess</b> after each oath and repay the claimant. Since he did not do so, each oath is considered a separate denial of a monetary claim.
If <b>five</b> people <b>were suing him</b> and <b>they said to him: Give us</b> back <b>our deposit that is in your possession,</b> and the defendant says: On my <b>oath nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>liable</b> for <b>only one</b> false oath. But if he responds to each claimant: On my <b>oath nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession, and nothing</b> of <b>yours, and nothing</b> of <b>yours,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> his oath concerning <b>each and every</b> claim that he denied. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> He is not liable for his oath concerning each claim <b>unless he says:</b> On my <b>oath, at the end</b> of the denial, i.e., he says: Nothing of yours is in my possession, and nothing of yours, on my oath, so that it is clear that he is taking an oath to each one. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> He is not liable for his oath concerning each claim <b>unless he says:</b> On my <b>oath, to each and every</b> claimant, i.e., he says: On my oath nothing of yours is in my possession, and on my oath nothing of yours, to each claimant separately.
In a case where the claimant said: <b>Give me</b> back <b>my deposit, and pledge, stolen item, and lost item that are in your possession,</b> and the defendant responds: On my <b>oath nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>liable</b> for <b>only one</b> false oath. But if he responds: On my <b>oath I do not have in my possession your deposit, or pledge, stolen item, or lost item,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> his oath concerning <b>each and every</b> claim.
In a case where the claimant said: <b>Give me</b> back <b>my wheat, and barley, and spelt that are in your possession,</b> if the defendant responds: On my <b>oath nothing of yours</b> is <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>liable</b> for <b>only one</b> false oath. But if he responds: On my <b>oath I do not have in my possession your wheat, barley, or spelt,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> his oath concerning <b>each and every</b> claim. <b>Rabbi Meir says: Even</b> if the defendant <b>says:</b> On my oath I do not have in my possession your <b>grain of wheat, or grain of barley, or grain of spelt,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> his oath concerning <b>each and every</b> claim.
The mishna continues: If one accuses another: <b>You raped or you seduced my daughter, and</b> the other <b>says: I did not rape and I did not seduce</b> your daughter, to which the father replied: <b>I administer an oath to you, and</b> the defendant <b>said: Amen,</b> the defendant is <b>liable</b> to bring a guilt-offering if it is a false oath. <b>Rabbi Shimon deems</b> him <b>exempt, since one does not pay a fine based on his own</b> admission. Had he confessed he would have been exempt from paying the fine; he is therefore not liable for his denial. The Rabbis <b>said to him: Even though he does not pay</b> the <b>fine based on his own</b> admission, <b>he does pay</b> compensation for <b>humiliation and</b> compensation for <b>degradation</b> resulting from her being raped or seduced, which are monetary claims and not fines, <b>based on his own</b> admission. He is therefore liable for a false oath, as he denied a monetary claim.
Similarly, in a case where one person accuses another: <b>You stole my ox, and the</b> defendant <b>says: I did not steal</b> your ox, if the claimant replied: <b>I administer an oath to you, and</b> the defendant <b>said: Amen,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay for the ox due to the theft and to bring a guilt-offering if he lied, since by his oath he is denying that he owes the value of the ox that he would have to pay if he admitted to stealing it. But in a case where the claimant accuses the defendant of stealing the ox and slaughtering or selling it, and the defendant says: <b>I stole</b> the ox, <b>but I did not slaughter or sell</b> it, and this is a lie, if the claimant replied: <b>I administer an oath to you, and he said: Amen,</b> then the defendant is <b>exempt</b> from the fivefold payment for slaughtering or selling another’s ox, since it is a fine.
If the claimant says: <b>Your ox killed my ox, and</b> the defendant lies and <b>says: It did not kill</b> your ox, to which the claimant replied: <b>I administer an oath to you, and he said: Amen,</b> then he is <b>liable</b> for his false oath. But if the claimant says: <b>Your ox killed my</b> Canaanite <b>slave</b> and you are therefore liable to pay me a fine of thirty shekels, <b>and he</b> lies and <b>says:</b> It <b>did not kill</b> your slave, to which the claimant replied: <b>I administer an oath to you, and he said: Amen,</b> then he is <b>exempt,</b> because payment for the slave is a fine.
If the claimant <b>said to him: You injured me and caused me a wound, and</b> the defendant <b>says: I did not injure</b> you <b>and I did not cause you a wound,</b> to which the claimant replies: <b>I administer an oath to you, and he said: Amen,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> But if <b>one’s</b> Canaanite <b>slave said to him: You knocked out my tooth, or: You blinded my eye,</b> and you are therefore required to emancipate me, <b>and he says: I did not knock out</b> your tooth, <b>or: I did not blind</b> your eye, to which the slave replies: <b>I administer an oath to you, and he said: Amen,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a guilt-offering even though he lied, since the obligation to emancipate one’s slave in these cases is a penalty.
<b>This is the principle:</b> For <b>any</b> claim that the defendant would have to <b>pay based on his own</b> admission, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a guilt-offering for taking a false oath concerning that claim. <b>And</b> for any claim <b>that</b> he would <b>not pay based on his own</b> admission but would pay only by the testimony of witnesses, he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a guilt-offering for taking a false oath concerning that claim.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Aḥa bar Huna and Rav Shmuel, son of Rabba bar bar Ḥana, and Rav Yitzḥak, son of Rav Yehuda, studied</b> tractate <b><i>Shevuot</i></b> in <b>the study hall of Rabba. Rav Kahana encountered them</b> and inquired with regard to a matter in the mishna. He <b>said</b>

Daf 37a

<b>to them:</b> If one <b>intentionally</b> took a false <b>oath on a deposit and</b> witnesses <b>forewarned him, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it the case that <b>since</b> the <i>halakha</i> of an oath on a deposit <b>is a novelty, as in the entire Torah we do not find</b> another case where one who transgressed <b>intentionally brings an offering</b> for atonement, <b>but here</b> he does <b>bring an offering</b> for transgressing the prohibition intentionally, there <b>is no difference</b> whether witnesses <b>forewarned him and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether <b>they did not forewarn him,</b> and he is liable to bring a guilt-offering, though generally, there is no offering brought when there was forewarning? <b>Or perhaps, that matter</b> of bringing a guilt-offering when one intentionally takes a false oath applies only <b>when they did not forewarn him; but when they forewarned him,</b> he is <b>flogged,</b> as this is the standard punishment for an intentional transgression, and he does <b>not bring an offering. Or perhaps, we impose both</b> lashes and a guilt-offering.
<b>They said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>We learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakhot</i> of an <b>oath on a deposit are more stringent than</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of an oath of testimony, <b>as</b> one is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>lashes for intentionally</b> taking a false oath on a deposit, <b>and for unwittingly</b> taking a false oath on a deposit one is liable to bring <b>a guilt-offering worth</b> at least two <b>silver shekels;</b> whereas one who takes a false oath of testimony, whether intentionally or unwittingly, brings a sin-offering. <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>states</b> that <b>for intentionally</b> taking a false oath on a deposit one <b>is liable</b> to receive <b>lashes, by inference</b> it can be understood that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where witnesses <b>forewarned him,</b> as one cannot receive lashes without forewarning, <b>and it is stating: Yes,</b> he is liable to receive <b>lashes,</b> but he is <b>not</b> liable to bring <b>an offering.</b> The <i>baraita</i>, then, resolves the question of Rav Kahana.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>And what is the stringency</b> in the fact that one who intentionally takes a false oath on a deposit receives lashes? It is due to the fact that <b>a person prefers to bring an offering rather than receive lashes.</b>
<b>Rava bar Itai said to</b> the students of Rabba: You cannot answer the question from that <i>baraita</i>, as <b>who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that <b>intentionally</b> taking <b>a false oath on a deposit is not subject to atonement?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Shimon. But</b> according <b>to the Rabbis,</b> he is liable to <b>bring</b> a guilt-<b>offering, as well</b> as receiving lashes. Therefore, the question remains unanswered.
<b>Rav Kahana said to</b> the students: <b>Apart from this,</b> you cannot answer my question from this <i>baraita</i>, <b>as I</b> am the one who <b>teaches</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>and this</b> is how <b>I teach it:</b> An oath on a deposit is more stringent than an oath of testimony, since for taking a false oath on a deposit <b>either intentionally or unwittingly</b> one is liable to bring <b>a guilt-offering worth</b> at least two <b>silver shekels. And what</b> is <b>the stringency</b> in this <i>halakha</i>? It is <b>that there,</b> with regard to an oath of testimony, he is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering</b> that can be <b>worth</b> even <b>one-sixth</b> of one dinar, <b>and here,</b> the <b>guilt-offering</b> incurred for an oath on a deposit must be <b>worth</b> at least two <b>silver shekels.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let him derive</b> an answer to his question <b>from</b> his version of the <i>baraita</i>, which indicates that one who intentionally takes a false oath on a deposit brings an offering and does not receive lashes. The Gemara responds: <b>Perhaps</b> it is referring to a case <b>where they did not forewarn him;</b> had he been forewarned, he would be flogged.
The Gemara presents <b>a different version</b> of the previous discussion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer to the question of Rav Kahana from the mishna: <b>One is not liable for</b> taking a false oath on a deposit <b>unwittingly.</b> And <b>what is he liable for</b> when he <b>intentionally</b> takes a false oath? <b>A guilt-offering worth</b> at least two <b>silver shekels.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What, is it not</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> witnesses <b>forewarned him,</b> and the mishna nevertheless rules only that he must bring an offering? The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>Here, too,</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the witnesses <b>did not forewarn him.</b>
The Gemara continues to seek an answer to Rav Kahana’s question: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an answer from a <i>baraita</i>. After comparing the case of a nazirite to one who takes an oath on a deposit, the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>No, if you said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that <i>baraita</i> discusses is true <b>with regard to an impure nazirite, who is indeed flogged</b> for intentionally becoming impure, <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the case <b>with regard to</b> one who took <b>an oath on a deposit, who is not flogged?</b> The Gemara notes: Now, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>states</b> that a nazirite <b>is flogged, by inference</b> it can be understood that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> witnesses <b>forewarned him,</b> as one is not liable to receive lashes without forewarning; <b>and</b> yet the <i>baraita</i> <b>states: Shall you say</b> that this is the case <b>with regard to</b> one who took <b>an oath on a deposit, who is not flogged?</b> One can infer: <b>But</b> he does <b>bring</b> a guilt-<b>offering.</b>
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it states that <b>he is not flogged?</b> It means <b>that</b> he is <b>not exempted through lashes</b> alone and he must also bring an offering. The Gemara asks: <b>By inference,</b> does this mean <b>that an impure nazirite is exempted through lashes</b> alone? <b>Isn’t it written</b> in the Torah explicitly <b>with regard to him</b> that there is a requirement to bring <b>an offering?</b> The Gemara responds: The offering brought by an impure nazirite does not serve as an atonement. Rather, <b>there,</b> the nazirite <b>brings an offering in order</b> to purify himself so <b>that his naziriteship can go into effect</b> while he is <b>in</b> a state of <b>purity.</b> The offering must be brought even if the nazirite became impure unwittingly.
<b>The Sages said</b> this matter <b>before Rabba,</b> i.e., they related the question of Rav Kahana as to whether one who intentionally takes a false oath and was forewarned by witnesses is liable to bring an offering. Rabba <b>said to them:</b> May one conclude <b>by inference that</b> in a case <b>when they did not warn him but there are witnesses</b> to the fact that the defendant owes money to the claimant, <b>he is liable</b> to bring an offering? Isn’t this case <b>merely a verbal denial</b> that does not have any effect with regard to liability to pay? Since there are witnesses who will testify that the defendant owes the claimant, his denial and false oath did not exempt him from payment and he therefore should not be liable to bring a guilt-offering for taking a false oath. The Gemara infers: <b>Evidently, Rabba holds</b> that <b>one who denies a monetary</b> claim <b>to which there are witnesses</b> is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a guilt-offering for taking a false oath, since the witnesses will testify to the validity of the claimant’s claim and the denial of the defendant is of no consequence.
<b>Rav Ḥanina said to Rabba:</b> A <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught that supports your</b> opinion: The verse states with regard to an oath denying a monetary claim: <b>“And deal falsely therein”</b> (Leviticus 5:22), which serves to <b>exclude one who admits to</b> the truth of the claim of <b>one of</b> a group of <b>brothers or to one of</b> a group of <b>partners,</b> even if he denies the claim to the rest of the brothers or partners. The same verse also states: <b>“And swear to a lie,”</b> which serves to <b>exclude one who borrows</b> money <b>with</b> a promissory <b>note or one who borrows</b> money <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses.</b> Evidently, one is not liable for taking a false oath concerning a monetary claim when there are witnesses who can testify to it.
Rabba <b>said to him: If</b> your proof is <b>because of that</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>you have not supported us,</b> since that <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the defendant <b>says: I borrowed, but I did not borrow in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> or he says: <b>I borrowed, but I did not borrow with</b> a promissory <b>note.</b> Since his denial is only with regard to the circumstances of the loan and not to the actual debt, he is exempt from liability for taking the false oath.
Rabba elaborates: <b>From where</b> in the <i>baraita</i> is this explanation apparent? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that it teaches</b> that the verse <b>“and deal falsely therein”</b> serves to <b>exclude one who admits to one of the brothers or to one of the partners. What are the circumstances of that</b> case where one admits <b>to one of the brothers? If we say that he admitted</b> only <b>the portion</b> of the debt owed <b>to that</b> brother, then why is he exempt? <b>Isn’t there the denial</b> of the claim <b>of the other</b> brother, which is a denial of a monetary claim? <b>Rather, is it not that</b> the brothers <b>said to him: You borrowed from both of us, and he said to them: No, I borrowed</b> all of the amount in question <b>from</b> only <b>one of you, which is merely a verbal denial,</b> as he admits that he owes the claimed amount and disputes only the circumstances of the debt. <b>And since the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case of <b>a verbal denial, the last clause</b> is <b>also</b> referring to <b>a verbal denial.</b> Consequently, one cannot cite a proof from this <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara attempts to prove that one who takes a false oath on a deposit is liable to bring an offering even when there are witnesses, and presents <b>a mnemonic</b> to remember the series of proofs: <b>Liability, sets, of the homeowner, stringent, nazirite.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: <b>He is not liable for unwittingly</b> taking a false oath by itself. <b>And what is he liable for</b> when he <b>intentionally</b> takes a false oath? He must bring <b>a guilt-offering worth</b> at least two <b>silver shekels.</b> The Gemara continues: <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case where he <b>intentionally</b> denies the claim of <b>witnesses,</b> and the mishna nevertheless teaches that he is liable to bring a guilt-offering? The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>No,</b> the mishna is referring to a case where there are no witnesses and he admits <b>on his own</b> that he <b>intentionally</b> took a false oath. Had there been witnesses, he would have been exempt from bringing an offering.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (31b) that discusses an oath of testimony: If <b>there were two sets of witnesses</b> who took an oath of testimony, and <b>the first</b> set falsely <b>denied</b> knowledge of the matter <b>and then the second</b> set falsely <b>denied</b> knowledge of the matter, <b>both are liable, because the testimony can exist with either of them.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Granted, the second</b> set <b>should be liable, since the first set</b> already <b>denied</b> knowledge of the incident and the validity of the claimant’s monetary claim now depends upon their testimony. <b>But why is</b> the <b>first</b> set <b>liable?</b>

Daf 37b

<b>Doesn’t the second</b> set <b>stand</b> ready to testify, so that the refusal of the first set of witnesses does not affect a monetary claim? Evidently, a denial of a monetary claim to which there are witnesses is still considered a denial.
<b>Ravina said: Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where at the time of the denial by the first</b> set, <b>the second</b> set of witnesses <b>were related</b> to one another <b>through their wives,</b> so that the second set was unfit to provide testimony; <b>and their wives were moribund. Lest you say: Most moribund people</b> actually <b>die</b> soon thereafter, and the witnesses are considered fit to provide testimony, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that <b>in any event they are currently alive and have not died.</b> The second set was therefore unfit to provide testimony.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a homeowner</b> acting as a bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>claimed</b> that <b>a thief</b>  stole <b>a deposit</b> from him, <b>and</b> the homeowner <b>took an oath</b> to that effect <b>and</b> then <b>admitted</b> that he was lying, <b>and witnesses came</b> and testified that the item was not stolen from the homeowner, the <i>halakha</i> depends on the circumstances. <b>If he admitted</b> to his lie <b>before</b> the <b>witnesses came</b> and testified, he <b>pays</b> the <b>principal</b> value of the item <b>and</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment for denying that he possessed the deposit, <b>and</b> he brings <b>a guilt-offering</b> as atonement for a false oath on a deposit. <b>If he admitted</b> his guilt <b>after</b> the <b>witnesses came</b> and testified, <b>he pays</b> the <b>double payment and</b> brings <b>a guilt-offering.</b> The <i>baraita</i> indicates that even in the case of a monetary claim to which there are witnesses, one is liable to bring a guilt-offering.
The Gemara responds: <b>Here, too,</b> explain this <i>baraita</i> <b>as Ravina</b> explained the previous <i>baraita</i>, that at the time the homeowner took his oath, the witnesses were related through their moribund wives and were unfit to provide testimony.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>an oath on a deposit are more stringent than</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of an oath of testimony, <b>as</b> one is <b>liable</b> to receive <b>lashes for intentionally</b> taking a false oath on a deposit, <b>and</b> one is liable to bring <b>a guilt-offering worth</b> at least two <b>silver shekels for</b> taking the oath <b>unwittingly.</b> Ravina infers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>states</b> that one <b>is flogged, by inference</b> it can be understood that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where there are witnesses</b> to the fact that the deposit is in the defendant’s possession and the defendant was forewarned, <b>and</b> yet it <b>states:</b> One is liable to bring <b>a guilt-offering worth</b> at least two <b>silver shekels for</b> taking the oath <b>unwittingly.</b>
<b>Rav Mordekhai said to them: Apart from this,</b> you cannot cite this <i>baraita</i> as a proof. <b>As, didn’t Rav Kahana already say to</b> the students (37a): <b>I</b> am the one who <b>teaches</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>and this</b> is how <b>I teach it:</b> An oath on a deposit is more stringent than an oath of testimony, since for taking a false oath on a deposit <b>either intentionally or unwittingly</b> one is liable to bring <b>a guilt-offering worth</b> at least two <b>silver shekels.</b> The <i>baraita</i> is not referring to a case in which there were witnesses who forewarned him.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>No, if you said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that <i>baraita</i> discusses is true <b>with regard to an impure nazirite, who is indeed flogged</b> for intentionally becoming impure, <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the case <b>with regard to</b> one who took <b>an oath on a deposit, who is not flogged?</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where there were no witnesses, why is</b> the nazirite <b>flogged? Rather,</b> isn’t it <b>obvious that there are witnesses, and</b> yet, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: Shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the case <b>with regard to</b> one who took <b>an oath on a deposit, who is not flogged?</b> It may be inferred that <b>he does not receive lashes but</b> does <b>bring an offering,</b> even though there are witnesses. The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba</b> is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One who denies a monetary</b> claim <b>to which there are witnesses</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring a guilt-offering for a false oath on a deposit. But if he denies a debt <b>concerning</b> which there is a promissory <b>note,</b> he is <b>exempt. Rav Pappa said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b> It <b>occurs that witnesses die,</b> and it is therefore possible that he would not be found liable through their testimony; he is therefore considered to have denied a monetary claim. By contrast, a promissory <b>note remains</b> in its place, and his denial would never have exempted him from payment.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rav Pappa:</b> This cannot be the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as it <b>also occurs that a promissory note becomes lost. Rather, Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: This is the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> It is <b>because</b> a promissory <b>note</b> comprises <b>a lien on land,</b> since the promissory note places a lien on the debtor’s property, <b>and one does not bring an offering</b> for an oath on a deposit <b>for denying a lien on land,</b> since one does not take an oath concerning land.
It <b>was stated:</b> In a case where one <b>administers an oath to witnesses</b> who deny knowing information with regard to ownership <b>of land</b> and they deny knowledge of the matter, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar disagree: One says</b> that the witnesses are <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering for a false oath of testimony, <b>and one says</b> that they are <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>It may be concluded that</b> it is <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan who says</b> they are <b>exempt.</b> This can be inferred <b>from</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One who denies a monetary</b> claim <b>to which there are witnesses</b> is <b>liable,</b> but one who denies a claim concerning which there is a promissory <b>note</b> is <b>exempt. And</b> this conclusion is <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> that the reasoning of Rabbi Yoḥanan is that a promissory note comprises a lien on land, and one does not bring an offering for denying a lien on land. The Gemara affirms: Indeed, <b>it may be concluded.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said to Rabbi Abbahu: Shall we say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute of Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis? As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who robbed another of a field and</b> then <b>a river flooded it,</b> he is <b>liable to provide</b> the field’s owner with <b>a different field,</b> since the value of the flooded field was significantly decreased and the robber must return the value of that which he stole; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. And the Rabbis say:</b> He is exempt from doing so, as <b>he</b> can <b>say to</b> the owner: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b> The robber may return the flooded field to its owner without reimbursing him for the loss in its value, since according to the Rabbis, land cannot be stolen. Consequently, the field is considered to be in the possession of its owner, and the thief is not obligated in the mitzva of returning a stolen item.
Rabbi Yirmeya continues: <b>And we say: With regard to what do they disagree? Rabbi Eliezer interprets</b> the verses that discuss an oath on a deposit and the mitzva to return stolen items according to the hermeneutical principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions, and the Rabbis interpret</b> them according to the hermeneutical principle of <b>generalizations and details.</b>
He explains: <b>Rabbi Eliezer interprets</b> the verses: “If anyone sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit or of pledge, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor…or of anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full” (Leviticus 5:21–24), according to the hermeneutical principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions.</b> The phrase “if anyone sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, <b>and deal falsely with his neighbor” amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i>. When the verse states: <b>“In a matter of deposit or of pledge,”</b> it has <b>restricted</b> the <i>halakha</i> to the case of a deposit. When the verse then states: <b>“Or of anything about which he has sworn falsely,</b> he shall restore it in full,” <b>it</b> has <b>then amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> again.
Accordingly, as the Torah <b>amplified and</b> then <b>restricted and</b> then <b>amplified</b> again, it has <b>amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include <b>everything</b> except for the specific matter excluded by the restriction. <b>What</b> is included due to the fact that the verse <b>has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The verse <b>has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include <b>everything</b> that one steals. <b>And what</b> is excluded due to the fact that the verse <b>restricted</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>It restricted</b> the <i>halakha</i> to exclude financial <b>documents,</b> which are dissimilar to a deposit in that their value is not intrinsic but rather due to their function. Consequently, according to Rabbi Eliezer, land that was stolen is included in the <i>halakhot</i> stated in these verses, and one who steals land must reimburse the field’s owner.
<b>And the Rabbis interpreted</b> these verses according to the hermeneutical principle of <b>generalizations and details.</b> The phrase <b>“and deal falsely with his neighbor”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> while the subsequent phrase, <b>“in a matter of deposit or of pledge, or of robbery,”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> When the verse then states: <b>“Or of anything about which he has sworn</b> falsely, he shall restore it in full,” <b>it</b> has <b>then generalized</b> again. In the case of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail.</b>
Accordingly, <b>just as the detail,</b> i.e., a deposit, <b>is explicitly</b> a case of <b>movable property and</b> has <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value, <b>so too,</b> the verse includes <b>anything that is movable property and</b> has <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value. Consequently, <b>land has been excluded, as it is not movable property.</b> Canaanite <b>slaves have been excluded, as they are compared to land</b> with regard to many areas of <i>halakha</i>. Financial <b>documents have been excluded because although they</b> are <b>movable property, they do not</b> have <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value.
Rabbi Yirmeya concludes: Shall we say that the <b>one who deems</b> the witnesses <b>liable</b> in a case of an oath of testimony concerning land, i.e., Rabbi Elazar, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> that land is included in the mitzva of returning stolen property and in the <i>halakhot</i> of an oath on a deposit, and by extension, in the <i>halakhot</i> of an oath of testimony; <b>and the one who deems</b> them <b>exempt,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that land is excluded from these <i>halakhot</i>?
Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>No,</b> the two disagreements do not completely correspond. The <b>one who deems</b> the witnesses <b>liable</b> must in fact hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. But the one who deems</b> them <b>exempt</b> could have <b>said to you: In this</b> case of an oath of testimony, <b>even Rabbi Eliezer concedes</b> that they are exempt from bringing an offering, <b>as the Merciful One states: “Of anything</b> about which he has sworn falsely,” <b>and not: Everything</b> about which he has sworn falsely. The verse indicates that only certain items are included in the <i>halakhot</i> of an oath of testimony. Therefore, land is excluded, since it is dissimilar to the specific instances mentioned in the verse.
<b>Rav Pappa said in the name of Rava: The mishna is also precisely</b> formulated, <b>as it teaches:</b> In a case where one accuses another: <b>You stole my ox, and</b> the defendant <b>says: I did not steal</b> your ox, if the claimant replied: <b>I administer an oath to you, and</b> the defendant <b>said: Amen,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> The mishna discusses a claim of a stolen ox, <b>whereas</b> it <b>does not teach</b> a claim of: <b>You stole my</b> Canaanite <b>slave. What is the reason? Is it not due to the fact that</b> a Canaanite <b>slave is compared to land, and one is not liable to bring an offering for a denial</b> in a matter of <b>a lien on land?</b>
<b>Rav Pappi said in the name of Rava:</b> There is no proof from the mishna, as <b>say the last clause</b> of the mishna: <b>This is the principle:</b> For <b>any</b> claim <b>that</b> the defendant would have to <b>pay based on his own</b> admission, he is <b>liable. And</b> for any claim that he would <b>not pay based on his own</b> admission, but by the testimony of witnesses, he is <b>exempt,</b> even if he denies the claim against him and takes an oath to that effect. Rav Pappi asks: <b>What is added</b> by the phrase: <b>This is the principle? Is it not to include</b> even an accusation of: <b>You stole my</b> Canaanite <b>slave,</b> in the <i>halakha</i> of oaths on a deposit?

Daf 38a

<b>Rather, no</b> inference is <b>to be learned from</b> the mishna.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>What is the case of an oath on a deposit?</b> It is where the claimant <b>said to</b> the defendant: <b>Give me my deposit, which is in your possession,</b> and the defendant replied: On my oath nothing of yours is in my possession, or the defendant said to him: Nothing of yours is in my possession; the claimant responded: I administer an oath to you, and the defendant said: Amen. In either case this defendant is liable to bring a guilt-offering if he lied. The mishna then discusses a case where five people sued him and he took an oath denying all of their claims. With regard to this case, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If he <b>included</b> all the denials in one oath, <b>he is liable</b> for <b>only one</b> false oath; if he <b>specified</b> them, <b>he is liable for</b> his oath concerning <b>each and every</b> claim; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that if he said: On my <b>oath nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is in my possession, <b>and nothing</b> of <b>yours, and nothing</b> of <b>yours,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> his oath concerning <b>each and every</b> claim.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that only if he said: <b>Nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is in my possession, <b>and nothing</b> of <b>yours, and nothing</b> of <b>yours,</b> on my <b>oath,</b> i.e., he said the word oath at the end, is he <b>liable for</b> his oath concerning <b>each and every</b> claim. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> He is not liable for his oath concerning each individual claim <b>unless he says:</b> On my <b>oath, to each and every</b> claimant.
Shmuel and Rabbi Yoḥanan disagree with regard to the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda: <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The phrasing where one uses the conjunction: And, between denials is considered <b>by Rabbi Meir</b> to be <b>a general</b> denial and is considered <b>by Rabbi Yehuda</b> to be <b>a specific</b> denial; and the phrasing where one refrains from using the conjunction: And, is considered <b>by Rabbi Yehuda</b> to be <b>a general</b> denial and is considered <b>by Rabbi Meir</b> to be <b>a specific</b> denial.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All concede in</b> a case where the defendant says: <b>And nothing</b> of <b>yours, that it is</b> considered <b>specific</b> and that he is liable for his oath concerning each claim, even Rabbi Meir. <b>They disagree only with regard to</b> a case where the defendant said: <b>Nothing of yours,</b> without the conjunctive: And. <b>As Rabbi Meir says:</b> It is considered <b>specific, and Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is considered <b>general. And what is</b> the case of <b>a general</b> denial according <b>to Rabbi Meir,</b> where one is liable for only one oath? It is the case where the defendant says, in the plural: On my <b>oath nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do they disagree</b> that they explain the opinion of Rabbi Meir differently? The Gemara responds: <b>Shmuel inferred</b> his explanation <b>from the <i>baraita</i>, and Rabbi Yoḥanan inferred</b> his explanation <b>from the mishna.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Shmuel inferred</b> his explanation <b>from the <i>baraita</i></b> as follows: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that the phrase: <b>And nothing</b> of <b>yours, is</b> considered <b>a specific</b> denial, for which one is liable for his oath concerning each and every claim, one may conclude <b>by inference that</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>understood that Rabbi Meir said</b> that <b>it is</b> considered <b>a general</b> denial, <b>and</b> therefore, <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagreed and <b>said to him:</b> No, <b>it is</b> considered <b>a specific</b> denial.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> in response to this inference that the <i>baraita</i> can be explained differently: <b>Both</b> phrases: Nothing of yours, and: And nothing of yours, <b>are</b> deemed <b>specific</b> denials <b>by Rabbi Meir; and Rabbi Yehuda said to him: With regard to: And nothing</b> of <b>yours, I concede to you</b> that it is considered specific. But <b>with regard to: Nothing</b> of <b>yours, I disagree with you</b> and consider it a general denial. <b>And Shmuel</b> would respond: If that is so, then why does Rabbi Yehuda state in the <i>baraita</i> the instance in which he concedes to Rabbi Meir? <b>Instead of conceding, let him disagree</b> and state the instance in which they differ.
The Gemara proceeds to explain the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan inferred</b> his explanation <b>from the mishna</b> as follows: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Meir,</b> who is the <i>tanna</i> associated with unattributed statements in the Mishna, <b>says:</b> If he addressed all of the claimants and said: On my <b>oath nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession, it is</b> deemed <b>a general</b> denial, one may conclude <b>by inference that</b> a denial phrased: <b>And nothing</b> of <b>yours, is</b> deemed <b>specific. As if it would enter your mind</b> that Rabbi Meir also deems: <b>And nothing</b> of <b>yours,</b> to be <b>a general</b> denial, then <b>instead of teaching us</b> that when one states in the plural: On my <b>oath nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession,</b> it is deemed general, <b>let him teach us</b> that when one states: On my <b>oath nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is in my possession, <b>and nothing</b> of <b>yours, and nothing</b> of <b>yours,</b> it is general, and <b>all the more so</b> it would be clear that when one states in the plural: On my <b>oath nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession,</b> it is considered general.
<b>And Shmuel says</b> that one may interpret the statement of Rabbi Meir as follows: <b>Anyone who says: And nothing</b> of <b>yours, is</b> considered <b>as though he says</b> in the plural: On my <b>oath nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession.</b>
The Gemara attempts to bring a proof for the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that if the defendant said: On my oath <b>nothing of yours</b> is in my possession, <b>and nothing</b> of <b>yours, and nothing</b> of <b>yours,</b> he is liable for his oath concerning each and every claim that he falsely denied. Evidently, Rabbi Meir deems: And nothing of yours, to be specific. The Gemara rejects the proof: Emend the language of the mishna and <b>teach: Nothing</b> of <b>yours,</b> nothing of yours, nothing of yours.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an additional proof from that which is taught in the mishna: In a case where the claimant says: <b>Give me</b> back <b>my deposit, and pledge, and stolen item, and lost item</b> that are in your possession, and the defendant responds: On my oath I do not have in my possession your deposit, or pledge, or stolen item, or lost item, he is liable for his oath concerning each and every claim. Evidently, by using the conjunction: Or, Rabbi Meir deems the denials specific, counter to the explanation of Shmuel. The Gemara rejects the proof: Emend the language of the mishna and <b>teach:</b> On my oath you do not have a deposit, <b>a pledge, a stolen item, a lost item,</b> in my possession.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from the mishna: In a case where the claimant said: <b>Give me</b> back my <b>wheat, and barley, and spelt</b> that are in your possession, if the defendant responds: On my oath nothing of yours is in my possession, he is liable for only one false oath. But if he responds: On my oath I do not have in my possession your wheat, or barley, or spelt, he is liable for his oath concerning each and every claim. The mishna is therefore counter to the explanation of Shmuel. The Gemara rejects the proof: Again, emend the language of the mishna and <b>teach:</b> Wheat, <b>barley, spelt,</b> without the conjunction: Or.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> could it be that <b>this <i>tanna</i> errs so much as he teaches</b> the mishna? The Gemara offers an alternative explanation: According to Shmuel, the mishna is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir. <b>Rather,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who says:</b> There <b>is no difference</b> if one says: <b>An olive-bulk an olive-bulk,</b> and there <b>is no difference</b> if one says: <b>An olive-bulk and an olive-bulk;</b> both <b>are</b> considered <b>specific</b> formulations.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof <b>from</b> Rabbi Meir’s <b>own</b> statement in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Meir says: Even</b> if the defendant says: On my oath I do not have in my possession your <b>grain of wheat, or grain of barley, or grain of spelt,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> his oath concerning <b>each and every</b> claim. Clearly, the conjunction: Or, renders the denial specific according to Rabbi Meir, counter to the explanation of Shmuel. The Gemara rejects the proof: Emend the language of the mishna and <b>teach:</b> On my oath I do not have in my possession <b>a grain of wheat, a grain of barley, a grain of spelt</b> of yours.
The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> novelty is there in a case where one takes an oath in this manner, that Rabbi Meir says: <b>Even? Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: Even</b> the singular form for <b>wheat includes</b> much <b>wheat, and</b> the singular form for <b>barley includes</b> much <b>barley, and</b> the singular form for <b>spelt includes</b> much <b>spelt,</b> i.e., although the defendant refers to the grains in the singular, his denial is referring to all wheat, all barley, and all spelt.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Give me</b> back <b>my deposit, and pledge, stolen item, and lost item that are in your possession, etc.</b> If the claimant said: <b>Give me</b> back my <b>wheat and barley,</b> and spelt, and the defendant responds: On my oath I do not have in my possession your wheat, or barley, or spelt, he is liable for his oath concerning each and every claim. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If <b>all of the</b> wheat, barley, and spelt were collectively worth at least one <b><i>peruta</i>,</b> then even if each type of grain was worth less than one <i>peruta</i>, their total value <b>combines</b> to render him liable.
<b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree with regard to</b> the ruling of the mishna. <b>One says</b> that when the mishna teaches that one is liable for his oath concerning each and every claim, it means that <b>he is liable for</b> the three <b>specific</b> denials of wheat, barley, and spelt, and he must bring three separate offerings; but <b>he is not liable for</b> the <b>general</b> oath taken at the beginning of his denial, i.e., when he said: On my oath I do not have in my possession. Accordingly, the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan was said with regard to the previous case in the mishna, where the defendant said: On my oath I do not have in my possession. <b>And one says</b> that <b>he is liable also for the general</b> oath taken at the beginning of his denial, so that the defendant is liable to bring a total of four offerings. Accordingly, even if the grains were worth only one <i>peruta</i> collectively and the defendant is not liable for any of the specific oaths, the defendant remains liable to bring an offering for the general oath according to Rabbi Yoḥanan.
The Gemara questions the second opinion: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If five people claimed from one defendant wheat, barley, and spelt, and the defendant took an oath denying each claim of each claimant, <b>there are</b> then <b>fifteen sin-offerings here</b> that the defendant is liable to bring? <b>And if it is so</b> that the defendant is liable for the general oath as well, <b>there would be</b> a total of <b>twenty</b> sin-offerings that he is liable to bring. The Gemara responds: <b>That <i>tanna</i> calculated</b> the defendant’s liability for <b>the specific</b> oaths; <b>he did not calculate</b> the defendant’s liability for <b>the general</b> oaths.
The Gemara now questions the first opinion: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>There are twenty sin-offerings here?</b> Evidently, Rabbi Ḥiyya does calculate the general oaths. The Gemara responds: <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> does not count the general oaths either; rather, it is referring <b>to</b> a different case entirely, where each of the five claimants claimed from the defendant <b>a deposit and a pledge and a stolen item and a lost item.</b>
<b>Rava raised a dilemma before Rav Naḥman:</b> In a case where <b>five</b> people <b>were suing</b> another <b>and they said to him: Give us back our deposit, pledge, and stolen item, and lost item that are in your possession,</b> and the defendant <b>said to one of them:</b> On my <b>oath your deposit, pledge, stolen item, and lost item</b> are <b>not in my possession, and neither</b> are <b>yours, and neither</b> are <b>yours, and neither</b> are <b>yours, and neither</b> are <b>yours, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is <b>he liable for</b> only <b>one</b> oath for each of the four claimants to whom he said: And neither are yours, since these are considered general oaths?

Daf 38b

<b>Or perhaps he is liable for</b> his oath concerning <b>each and every</b> claim made by each claimant.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from <b>that</b> which <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>There are twenty sin-offerings here</b> that the defendant must bring. The Gemara elaborates: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> the defendant <b>specified</b> each claim of each of the claimants in his oath, does <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya come to teach us a number?</b> Obviously, the defendant is liable to bring twenty offerings. <b>Rather, is it not</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he did not specify</b> an oath to each claimant, but he specified it to the first claimant and said: And neither are yours, to each of the remaining claimants? <b>And</b> therefore, <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that such a denial <b>is</b> considered <b>specific.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that if one accuses another: <b>You raped or you seduced my daughter,</b> and the other says: I did not rape and I did not seduce your daughter, to which the father replied: I administer an oath to you, and the defendant said: Amen, the defendant is liable to bring a guilt-offering if it is false oath, and Rabbi Shimon deems him exempt from liability for a false oath on a deposit. The reason is that the payment for rape or seduction is a fine, and one does not pay a fine based on his own admission; therefore, he is also exempt from bringing a guilt-offering for having taken a false oath. The Rabbis hold that he is liable since he would have been liable to pay compensation for humiliation and degradation resulting from her being raped or seduced, which are monetary claims. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon?</b> Rabbi Shimon holds that <b>since</b> the father <b>is primarily claiming the fine</b> and his claim to the other payments is secondary, the defendant is exempt from liability.
<b>Rava says: To what</b> case is this explanation of the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon compared?</b> It is compared <b>to</b> a case <b>where a person said to another: Give me</b> back <b>my wheat and barley and spelt that are in your possession,</b> and the other <b>said to him:</b> On my <b>oath your wheat</b> is <b>not in my possession; and it was</b> then <b>discovered that it</b> was only <b>wheat that he did not have, but he did have</b> the claimant’s <b>barley and spelt.</b> In that case, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that he is exempt</b> from liability for an oath on a deposit, <b>as when he took an oath with regard to the wheat, he took a truthful oath.</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>Are</b> the two cases <b>comparable? There,</b> in the case of the grain, the defendant <b>denies</b> only the other’s claim of <b>wheat,</b> but he <b>does not deny his</b> claim of <b>barley and spelt. Here,</b> the defendant <b>denies the entire matter,</b> as he claims that he never raped or seduced the man’s daughter. Rather, <b>this</b> explanation <b>is comparable only to</b> a case where one <b>said to another: Give me</b> back <b>my wheat and barley and spelt that are in your possession,</b> and the defendant said to him: On my <b>oath nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession at all, and it was</b> then <b>discovered</b> that it was only <b>wheat that he did not have, but he did have</b> the claimant’s <b>barley and spelt.</b> In that case, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that he is liable</b> for an oath on a deposit. This, then, cannot be the reasoning of Rabbi Shimon, as he exempts the defendant from liability.
<b>Rather, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> According <b>to the statement of Rabban Shimon,</b> the father <b>is claiming</b> only the <b>fine and not</b> the compensation for <b>humiliation and degradation</b> resulting from his daughter’s having been raped or seduced. According <b>to the statement of the Rabbis, he is also claiming</b> payment for <b>humiliation and degradation</b> resulting from her having been raped or seduced. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? Rav Pappa said: Rabbi Shimon holds: A person does not forgo</b> a claim to <b>something with a fixed</b> value, such as a fine, <b>and claim something whose</b> value is <b>not fixed</b> and requires an appraisal, such as humiliation and degradation resulting from being raped or seduced. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that one does <b>not forgo</b> a claim to <b>something that</b> the defendant <b>is not exempt</b> from paying <b>if he admits</b> his guilt, <b>and claim something that</b> the defendant <b>is exempt</b> from paying <b>if he admits</b> his guilt, such as a fine.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> By Torah law, the <b>oath</b> imposed <b>by the judges</b> upon one who admits to part of a claim is administered only when <b>the claim is</b> for the value of at least <b>two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i>, <b>and the</b> defendant’s <b>admission is</b> for <b>the value of</b> at least <b>one <i>peruta</i>. And</b> furthermore, <b>if the admission is not of</b> the same <b>type</b> as <b>the claim,</b> i.e., the defendant admitted to a debt that the claimant did not claim, the defendant is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath.
<b>How so?</b> If the claimant said to the defendant: <b>I have two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i> <b>in your possession,</b> and the latter responded: <b>You have only one <i>peruta</i>,</b> a coin made from copper, <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath (see 39b). But if the claimant said: <b>I have two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i> <b>and one <i>peruta</i> in your possession,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>You have only one <i>peruta</i> in my possession,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath.
If the claimant said: <b>I have one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>Nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> as he denies the entire claim. But if the claimant said: <b>I have one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>You have only fifty dinars in my possession,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath, as he admitted to a part of the claim.
If the claimant said: My late <b>father had one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> and I am now claiming them, and the defendant responded: <b>You have only fifty dinars in my possession,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath, <b>as he is like one returning a lost item,</b> since he could have easily denied the entire claim.
§ The mishna discusses other cases where the defendant denies an entire claim. In a case where one said to another: <b>I have one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> and the latter <b>said to him: Yes,</b> I acknowledge that claim; and <b>the next day</b> the claimant <b>said to him: Give</b> the money <b>to me,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>I</b> already <b>gave it to you,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> But if he responded: <b>Nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession,</b> i.e., he denies that a debt ever existed, he is <b>liable</b> to pay, as he already admitted that he owed him the amount.
In a case where the claimant said: <b>I have one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> and the defendant <b>said to him: Yes,</b> to which the claimant responded: <b>Give</b> the money <b>to me only in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> then if <b>the next day</b> the claimant <b>said to him: Give</b> the money <b>to me,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>I</b> already <b>gave it to you,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay, <b>as</b> he is <b>required to give it</b> to him <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> and he cannot prove that he did so.
§ The mishna resumes discussion of the oath imposed by the court in a case where the defendant admits to a part of a claim. If the claimant said: <b>I have a <i>litra</i>,</b> i.e., a specific weight, <b>of gold in your possession,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>You have only a <i>litra</i> of silver in my possession,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath, as his admission relates to a different item than that which the claim relates to. But if the claimant said: <b>I have a gold dinar in your possession,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>You have only a silver dinar, or a <i>tereisit</i>, or a <i>pundeyon</i>, or a <i>peruta</i> in my possession,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath, <b>as</b> they are <b>all</b> of <b>one type;</b> they are all <b>coins.</b> Since the claim concerns money, the difference between the different types of coins is disregarded, as the claim is essentially referring to the monetary value, not to a specific type of coin.
If the claimant said: <b>I have a <i>kor</i> of grain in your possession,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>You have only a half-<i>kor</i> of legumes in my possession,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> But if the claimant said: <b>I have a <i>kor</i> of produce in your possession,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>You have only a half-<i>kor</i> of legumes in my possession,</b> he is <b>liable, as legumes are included in produce.</b>
If one <b>claimed</b> that another owes <b>him wheat, and</b> the defendant <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him barley,</b> he is <b>exempt; and Rabban Gamliel deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to take an oath. According to Rabban Gamliel, one who admits to a part of the claim is liable to take an oath even if the admission is not of the same type as the claim.
With regard to <b>one who claims</b> that <b>another</b> owes him <b>jugs of oil, and</b> the latter then <b>admitted</b> that he owes <b>him pitchers,</b> i.e., the jugs themselves, but not the oil, <b>Admon says: Since he admitted to him</b> with regard to <b>a part</b> of the claim, and his admission was <b>of the</b> same <b>type</b> as <b>the claim,</b> i.e., the claim included both containers and oil and he admitted to owing him containers, <b>he must take an oath. And the Rabbis say: The</b> partial <b>admission</b> in this case <b>is not of</b> the same <b>type</b> as <b>the claim,</b> as he completely denied owing him oil. <b>Rabban Gamliel said: I see the statement of Admon</b> as correct.
If one <b>claimed</b> that another owes <b>him vessels and land, and</b> the defendant <b>admitted to</b> owing him <b>vessels but denied</b> the claim of <b>land,</b> or conversely, he admitted <b>to</b> owing him <b>land but denied</b> the claim of <b>vessels,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath, as oaths are not taken concerning claims involving land. If <b>he admitted to part</b> of the claim about <b>the land,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> If he admitted <b>to part</b> of the claim about <b>the vessels,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath concerning the entire claim, <b>as property that does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, <b>binds the property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., the land, so that the oath about the movable property can be extended to require him <b>to take an oath concerning</b> the land as well.
<b>One does not take an oath concerning the claim of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor. And</b> the court <b>does not administer an oath to a minor. But one does take an oath to a minor, or to</b> a representative of <b>the Temple</b> treasury with regard to consecrated property.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>How</b> does the court <b>administer an oath to</b> someone who is liable to take an oath? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The court <b>administers to him the oath stated in the Torah, as it is written</b> in Abraham’s instruction to his servant: <b>“And I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven”</b> (Genesis 24:3).
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: In accordance with whose</b> opinion is Rav’s statement? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Idi, who says</b> that when one is liable to take an oath, <b>we require</b> him to take it using <b>the ineffable name</b> of God?
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: You</b> may <b>even say</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that one is merely required to take an oath <b>using an appellation</b> of God. <b>And</b> the practical <b>ramification</b> of Rav’s statement is that just as in the aforementioned verse, Abraham said: “Please put your hand under my thigh, and I will make you swear” (Genesis 24:2–3), instructing his servant to grasp his circumcised penis, which is considered sacred to some degree, so too, in oaths administered by the court, <b>one must grasp</b> a sacred <b>item in his hand</b> while taking the oath.
<b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava; as Rava said: This judge who administers an oath “by the Lord, the God of heaven,”</b> without instructing the litigant to grasp a sacred item, <b>is considered like one who made a mistake with regard to a matter</b> that appears in the <b>Mishna;</b> in which case his ruling is <b>revoked,</b> and the litigant must repeat the oath. <b>And Rav Pappa said: This judge who administers an oath in</b> which the litigant grasps <b>phylacteries,</b> not a Torah scroll, <b>is considered like one who made a mistake with regard to a matter</b> that appears in the <b>Mishna;</b> in which case his ruling is <b>revoked,</b> and the litigant must repeat the oath.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava, but the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa. The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava</b> that if the litigant merely took an oath using the ineffable name of God, he is required to take another oath, <b>as he was not grasping</b> any sacred <b>item in his hand; but the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa,</b> that if the litigant was grasping phylacteries he is required to take another oath, <b>as he was grasping</b> a sacred <b>item in his hand,</b> even though it was not a Torah scroll.
One takes <b>an oath while standing,</b> but <b>a Torah scholar</b> takes an oath <b>while sitting.</b> One takes <b>an oath</b> grasping <b>a Torah scroll</b> <i>ab initio</i>, but <b>a Torah scholar</b> may take an oath grasping <b>phylacteries <i>ab initio</i>.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An oath</b> imposed <b>by the judges may also</b> be <b>recited in its language,</b> i.e., in any language spoken by the one taking the oath. It is not required that the oath be in Hebrew.
Before he takes the oath, the judges <b>say to him: Be aware</b>

Daf 39a

<b>that the entire world trembled when the Holy One, Blessed be He, said at</b> Mount <b>Sinai: “You shall not take the name of the Lord, your God, in vain,</b> for the Lord will not hold guiltless one who takes His name in vain” (Exodus 20:7).
<b>And</b> be aware that <b>with regard to all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah it is stated: “And will…clear the guilty [<i>venakkeh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 34:7); <b>whereas here,</b> with regard to taking a false oath, <b>it is stated: “Will not hold guiltless [<i>lo yenakkeh</i>].” And</b> be aware that with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah, punishment is exacted</b> only <b>from</b> the transgressor, whereas <b>here,</b> punishment is exacted <b>from him and from his family, as it is stated: “Do not allow your mouth to bring your flesh into guilt”</b> (Ecclesiastes 5:5). The verse indicates that one who sins with his mouth, by taking a false oath, causes his flesh to be punished as well; <b>and one’s flesh is nothing other than his relative, as it is stated: “And that you not hide yourself from your own flesh”</b> (Isaiah 58:7).
<b>And</b> be aware that with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah, punishment is exacted</b> only <b>from</b> the transgressor; whereas <b>here,</b> punishment is exacted <b>from him and from the entire world, as it is stated: “Swearing, and lying,</b> and murdering, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break all bounds…Therefore, the land mourns, and everyone who dwells therein languishes” (Hosea 4:2–3).
The Gemara suggests: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that punishment is not exacted from the entire world <b>unless he commits all of</b> the sins mentioned in the verse? The Gemara answers: This should <b>not enter your mind, as it is written: “Because of swearing the land mourns”</b> (Jeremiah 23:10), indicating that taking a false oath is sufficient to cause the land to mourn. <b>And it is</b> similarly <b>written</b> in the verse in Hosea: <b>“Therefore, the land mourns, and everyone who dwells therein languishes.”</b> Both verses employ a term of mourning.
The <i>baraita</i> continues with the judges’ forewarning: <b>And</b> be aware that with regard to <b>all the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah, if</b> the transgressor <b>has merit,</b> God <b>suspends his</b> punishment for <b>two or three generations,</b> and only if his descendants follow in his ways are they punished. Whereas <b>here, punishment is exacted from him immediately, as it is stated:</b> “This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole land…<b>I cause it to go forth, says the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of he who swears falsely by My name; and it shall abide in the midst of his house and shall consume it, with its timber and its stones”</b> (Zechariah 5:3–4).
The <i>baraita</i> analyzes the verse: <b>“I cause it to go forth”</b> means <b>immediately. “And it shall enter into the house of the thief”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who deceives people,</b> e.g., one <b>who has no money in the possession of another, but claims</b> money from <b>him and administers an oath to him</b> in court, thereby causing an oath to be taken in vain. <b>“And into the house of he who swears falsely by My name”</b> is <b>as it indicates,</b> in accordance with its straightforward meaning. From the end of the verse: <b>“And it shall abide in the midst of his house and shall consume it, with its timber and its stones,” you have therefore learned</b> that <b>a false oath consumes things that</b> even <b>fire and water do not consume,</b> such as stones.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If</b> the defendant <b>says</b> at this point: <b>I will not take an oath,</b> the court <b>dismisses him immediately,</b> and rules him liable to pay. <b>And if he says: I will take an oath, the</b> people <b>standing there say to each other: “Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men,</b> and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be swept away in all their sins” (Numbers 16:26). <b>And when</b> the judges <b>administer the oath to him, they say to him: Be aware that we administer an oath to you not according to your understanding</b> of the oath, <b>but according to the</b> objective <b>understanding of the Omnipresent and according to the understanding of the court,</b> i.e., the judges’ intention.
This is <b>as we</b> have <b>found</b> written <b>with regard to Moses, our teacher. When he administered an oath to the Jewish people</b> in the plains of Moab so that they would accept the Torah upon themselves, <b>he said to them: Know that</b> it is <b>not according to your understanding that I administer an oath to you, but according to the understanding of the Omnipresent and according to my understanding. As it is stated: “Neither with you only</b> do I make this covenant and this oath” (Deuteronomy 29:13), which is homiletically interpreted to mean: Not only according to your intention.
Having quoted a verse, the <i>baraita</i> tangentially interprets the subsequent verse. From the phrase: <b>“But with he who stands here</b> with us this day” (Deuteronomy 29:14), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>those who stood at Mount Sinai</b> were included in this covenant. <b>From where</b> do I derive that <b>the subsequent generations, and the converts who will convert in the future,</b> were also included? <b>The verse states: “And also with he who is not here</b> with us this day” (Deuteronomy 29:14).
<b>And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the <b>mitzvot that</b> the Jewish people <b>accepted upon themselves at Mount Sinai</b> were included in the oath. <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>mitzvot that were to be initiated in the future, for example, the reading of the Megilla,</b> the Scroll of Esther, on Purim, were also included? <b>The verse states:</b> “The Jews <b>ordained and took</b> upon themselves…that they would keep these two days” (Esther 9:27), which is homiletically interpreted to mean: <b>They ordained,</b> in the generation of Esther, mitzvot <b>that they had already accepted</b> upon themselves by oath in the plains of Moab.
§ The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>. <b>What</b> is the precise meaning of the statement: An oath imposed by the judges <b>may also</b> be <b>recited in its language?</b>
The Gemara answers: It is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sota</i> 32a): <b>These are recited in any language</b> and it is not required that they be recited in Hebrew: <b>The portion of</b> the warning and the oath administered by the priest to <b>a woman suspected by her husband of having been unfaithful [<i>sota</i>]; the declaration of tithes,</b> which occurs after the third and the sixth year of the seven-year Sabbatical cycle, when one declares that he has given his tithes appropriately; <b>the recitation of <i>Shema</i>; and</b> the <i>Amida</i> <b>prayer; and Grace after Meals; and the oath of testimony,</b> where one takes an oath that he does not have any testimony to provide on a given issue; <b>and the oath on a deposit,</b> where one takes an oath that he does not have possession of another’s deposit. All these may be recited in any language. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>also states,</b> as an addendum to this <i>halakha</i>, that <b>an oath</b> imposed <b>by the judges may also</b> be <b>recited in its language,</b> i.e., in any language.
§ <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> above that the judges <b>say to him: Be aware that the entire world trembled when the Holy One, Blessed be He, said: “You shall not take the name of the Lord, your God, in vain.” What is the reason</b> that the entire world trembled? <b>If we say</b> it was <b>because</b> this prohibition <b>was given at</b> Mount <b>Sinai,</b> this is difficult, as when the entire world trembled, the rest of the <b>Ten Commandments were also given</b> at Mount Sinai. This quality is not unique to this specific prohibition.
<b>And</b> if it is <b>rather due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> this prohibition is <b>severe, is it</b> more <b>severe</b> than all the other prohibitions? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>These are minor</b> transgressions: Violation of an ordinary <b>positive</b> mitzva <b>and</b> an ordinary <b>negative</b> mitzva, <b>except for: “You shall not take</b> the name of the Lord, your God, in vain.” And these are <b>major</b> transgressions: Those for which one is liable to receive <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>] or a court</b>-imposed <b>death</b> penalty; <b>and “You shall not take</b> the name of the Lord, your God, in vain” is also <b>among them.</b> Evidently, this transgression is no more severe than transgressions that incur <i>karet</i> or the death penalty.
<b>Rather, the reason</b> the world trembled particularly when this prohibition was given is <b>as it is taught</b> subsequently in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And with regard to all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah it is stated: “And will…clear the guilty,” whereas here, it is stated: “Will not hold guiltless.”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And is it not stated with regard to all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah</b> that God <b>“will not hold guiltless [<i>lo yenakkeh</i>]”</b> one who transgresses? <b>But isn’t it written: “And Who will by no means clear the guilty [<i>venakkeh lo yenakkeh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 34:7)?
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse is <b>necessary for</b> that which is derived through the homiletic interpretation <b>of Rabbi Elazar, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar says: It is not possible to say: And will clear the guilty [<i>venakkeh</i>],</b> about all transgressions, <b>since: Will not clear the guilty [<i>lo yenakkeh</i>], is already stated.</b> And <b>it is not possible to say: Will not clear the guilty [<i>lo yenakkeh</i>], since: And will clear the guilty [<i>venakkeh</i>], is already stated. How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? The Holy One, Blessed be <b>He, clears those</b> guilty ones <b>who repent and does not clear those who do not repent.</b>
§ It is stated in the <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>all of the transgressions in the Torah, punishment is exacted</b> only <b>from</b> the transgressor, whereas <b>here,</b> punishment is exacted <b>from him and from his family.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is punishment <b>not</b> exacted <b>from</b> the transgressor’s <b>family</b> with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah?</b>
<b>But isn’t it written</b> in the Torah with regard to one who worships Molech: <b>“Then I will set My face against that man, and against his family,</b> and I will cut him off” (Leviticus 20:5)? <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon said: If he sinned, how did his family sin?</b> Why are they punished? This serves <b>to tell you</b> that <b>there is no family that has</b> an unauthorized <b>tax collector among them</b> in <b>which all of</b> the family members <b>are not</b> regarded as unauthorized <b>tax collectors, and</b> similarly, there is no family <b>that has a bandit [<i>listim</i>] among them</b> in <b>which all of</b> the family members <b>are not</b> regarded as <b>bandits.</b> This is <b>because they cover for him.</b> Evidently, punishment is exacted from the transgressor’s family with regard to transgressions other than taking a false oath.
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to other transgressions, the transgressor’s family is punished <b>with another punishment,</b> less severe than the one the transgressor receives, whereas <b>here,</b> with regard to a false oath, the transgressor’s family is punished <b>with his punishment. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> with regard to one who worships Molech: <b>“And I will cut him off”? Since it is stated</b> earlier in the verse: <b>“Then I will set My face</b> against that man, and against his family,” one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the entire family</b> is liable <b>to</b> be punished with <b><i>karet</i>.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “And I will cut <b>him</b> off,” indicating that only <b>he</b> is liable <b>to</b> be punished with <b><i>karet</i>,</b> whereas <b>his entire family is not</b> liable <b>to</b> be punished with <b><i>karet</i>.</b>
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah, punishment is exacted</b> only <b>from him,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> punishment is exacted <b>from him and from the entire world, as it is stated: “Swearing and lying,</b> and murdering, and stealing, and committing adultery,” <b>and it is written: “Therefore, the land mourns.”</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that punishment is not exacted from the entire world <b>unless he commits all</b> the sins mentioned in the verse? The Gemara answers: This should <b>not enter your mind, as it is written: “Because of swearing the land mourns”</b> (Jeremiah 23:10), indicating that a false oath is sufficient to cause the land to mourn.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of the</b> other <b>transgressions in the Torah,</b> is punishment <b>not</b> exacted <b>from the entire world? But isn’t it written: “And they shall stumble one upon another”</b> (Leviticus 26:37)? This verse is homiletically interpreted to mean that they shall stumble spiritually, <b>one due to the iniquity of another,</b> which <b>teaches that the entire Jewish people are</b> considered <b>guarantors for one another.</b> Apparently, any transgression makes the entire world liable to be punished.

Daf 39b

The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in that verse, the reference is to a case <b>where</b> the others <b>had the ability to protest</b> the transgression, <b>and</b> nevertheless, <b>they did not protest.</b> By contrast, when one takes a false oath, the entire world is punished, even those who were not able to protest.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between</b> the punishment of <b>the wicked</b> people <b>in</b> a transgressor’s <b>family and</b> the punishment of the other <b>wicked</b> people <b>of the world,</b> and <b>between</b> the punishment of the <b>righteous</b> people <b>in his family and</b> the punishment of the other <b>righteous</b> people <b>of the world?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to other transgressions,</b> the transgressor <b>himself</b> is punished <b>with his</b> own <b>punishment,</b> i.e., that which is written in the Torah for that transgression. <b>And</b> the <b>wicked</b> people <b>of</b> his <b>family,</b> who covered for him, are punished <b>with</b> another <b>severe punishment, and</b> the <b>wicked</b> people of the rest <b>of the world,</b> who refrained from protesting his action, are punished <b>with a light punishment.</b> The <b>righteous</b> people both <b>here and here,</b> i.e., both his family members who did not cover for him, and others who were not able to protest his action, are <b>exempt</b> from punishment.
<b>With regard to</b> one who takes a false <b>oath,</b> by contrast, <b>he and</b> the <b>wicked</b> people <b>of</b> his <b>family</b> are all punished <b>with his punishment,</b> i.e., they receive the same punishment he does. <b>And</b> the <b>wicked</b> people of the rest <b>of the world,</b> who refrained from protesting his action, are punished <b>with a severe punishment, and</b> the <b>righteous</b> people both <b>here,</b> in his family, <b>and here,</b> in the rest of the world, are punished <b>with a light punishment,</b> even though they did not behave inappropriately. Accordingly, the consequences of taking a false oath are more severe than those of other transgressions.
§ The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>If</b> the defendant <b>says: I will not take an oath,</b> the court <b>dismisses him immediately,</b> and rules him liable to pay. <b>And if he says: I will take an oath, the</b> people <b>standing there say to each other: “Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted that one who is taking the oath stands to</b> transgress <b>the prohibition</b> against taking a false oath; <b>but why is the one administering the oath to him,</b> i.e., the claimant, considered a wicked man?
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> designation is <b>necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Tarfon says</b> that the verse: <b>“The oath of the Lord shall be between them both”</b> (Exodus 22:10), <b>teaches that</b> the punishment for a false <b>oath applies to both</b> the one who took the oath and the one who administered it to him.
§ The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And when</b> the judges <b>administer the oath to him, they say to him: Be aware that we administer an oath to you not according to your understanding,</b> but according to the understanding of the Omnipresent and according to the understanding of the court. The Gemara explains: <b>Why does</b> the court need <b>to say this to him?</b> It is <b>due to</b> deceptions like that <b>of the reed in Rava’s</b> court, where the defendant secretly inserted into a hollow reed the money he owed and gave it to the claimant to hold for him, whereupon he took an oath that he had already given him the money. He then took back the reed, as the claimant was unaware of its contents. In this way, he was able to state an oath that was technically true, although he was guilty of deception. To prevent this, the court stipulates that the oath must be true according to the court’s understanding.
§ The mishna teaches that the court administers an oath to one who admits to part of a claim only when <b>the claim is</b> for at least the value of <b>two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i>. Rav and Shmuel disagree with regard to the exact meaning of this statement. <b>Rav says</b> that <b>the denial of</b> the <b>claim</b> must be at least the value of <b>two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i>. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that the <b>claim itself</b> must be at least the value of <b>two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i>; i.e., <b>even</b> if the defendant <b>denied only one <i>peruta</i></b> of the claim, <b>or</b> conversely, if <b>he admitted to only one <i>peruta</i></b> of the two-<i>ma’a</i> claim, he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath.
<b>Rava said:</b> The language of <b>the mishna is precise in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav, and the</b> biblical <b>verses are</b> precise <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel.</b> The language of <b>the mishna is precise in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav, as it teaches: The claim</b> must be for at least the value of <b>two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i> <b>and the admission</b> must be at least <b>the value of one <i>peruta</i>, whereas it does not teach</b> that <b>the</b> minimum <b>denial of</b> the <b>claim</b> is <b>one <i>peruta</i>,</b> indicating that it must be more. <b>And also, we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 55a) that <b>the</b> minimum <b>admission</b> to part of a claim that renders one liable to take an oath is the value <b>of one <i>peruta</i>, whereas</b> that mishna <b>does not teach</b> that the minimum <b>denial</b> is the value <b>of one <i>peruta</i>.</b>
<b>And the verses are</b> precise <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel, as it is written</b> with regard to the case where an oath is administered due to admission to part of a claim: <b>“If a man delivers to his neighbor silver or vessels to safeguard”</b> (Exodus 22:6). It is derived from the juxtaposition of silver and vessels that <b>just as “vessels,”</b> in the plural, is referring to at least <b>two, so too, “silver”</b> is referring to at least <b>two</b> <i>ma’a</i> of silver. It is derived further that <b>just as silver is an item of substantial value, so too, any item of substantial value</b> is included. <b>And the Merciful One states</b> in the subsequent verses that an oath is administered in a case “where one says: <b>This is it”</b> (Exodus 22:8), i.e., where the defendant admits to only part of the claim of “silver or vessels” and denies the rest of the claim. Evidently, the denial can be for an amount less than two silver <i>ma’a</i>.
<b>And Rav</b> would respond <b>that</b> the phrase “this is it” <b>is necessary to</b> indicate <b>admission to a part of the claim,</b> but it does not indicate the value being denied, which must be at least two silver <i>ma’a</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Shmuel</b> derive both <i>halakhot</i> from the verse, namely, that admission to part of a claim is necessary for an oath to be administered, and that the denial can be less than the value of two <i>ma’a</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>It is written: “This is,” and it is written: “It.”</b> The repetition of these similar terms is homiletically interpreted to indicate <b>that if</b> the defendant <b>denied part</b> of the two-<i>ma’a</i> claim <b>and admitted to</b> the other <b>part,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath.
<b>And Rav</b> would respond that the repetition should be interpreted differently: <b>One</b> of the two terms is stated <b>to</b> indicate <b>admission of a part of the claim, and</b> the other <b>one</b> is stated <b>to</b> indicate <b>admission of the</b> same <b>type of</b> item as <b>the claim. And Shmuel</b> would respond: Even if you do not accept the derivation from the repetitious words, <b>don’t you derive from this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>by itself that</b> the denial may be less than two <i>ma’a</i>, since the admission <b>reduces</b> the value of <b>the claim?</b> If the claim was for two <i>ma’a</i>, as derived from the verse, and the defendant admitted to a part of the claim, then the value of denial was clearly less than two <i>ma’a</i>.
<b>Rather, Rav</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>when</b> the word <b>“silver” came initially, it came</b> as a source <b>for</b> the value of the <b>denial,</b> not the claim; <b>as if</b> this were not <b>so,</b> if it were meant to refer to the value of the claim, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> in the verse: <b>If a man delivers to his neighbor vessels to safeguard,</b> without mentioning silver, <b>and I</b> would <b>say</b> that <b>just as vessels are</b> at least <b>two, so too,</b> the claim must be for at least <b>two</b> of <b>any</b> item, including coins of silver. Accordingly, <b>why do I</b> need the word <b>“silver” that the Merciful One wrote?</b> Rather, <b>if</b> it <b>is not</b> needed for the <b>matter of</b> the <b>claim, apply it</b> to the <b>matter of</b> the <b>denial,</b> and derive from it that the denial must be at least the value of two silver <i>ma’a</i>.
<b>And Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> the word <b>“vessels” and</b> had <b>not written</b> the word <b>“silver” I would say</b> that <b>just as vessels are</b> at least <b>two, so too,</b> the claim must be for at least <b>two</b> of <b>any</b> item; <b>but we do not need</b> it to be <b>an item of substantial value.</b> Therefore, the word “silver” <b>teaches us</b> that it must be an item of substantial value, like silver.
The Gemara attempts to prove Rav’s opinion from the mishna. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that if the claimant said to the defendant: <b>I have two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i> <b>in your possession,</b> and the latter responded: <b>You have only one</b> copper <b><i>peruta</i> in my possession,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath. <b>What is the reason?</b> Is it <b>not because</b> the amount of the <b>claim</b> that was denied by the defendant <b>was lacking,</b> i.e., was less than, the minimum value of two <i>ma’a</i>? <b>And</b> accordingly, this is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: Do you maintain</b> that the case that <b>is taught</b> is one where the claim was for the <b>value</b> of two <i>ma’a</i>? The claim in the case that <b>is taught</b> was <b>specifically</b> for two silver <i>ma’a</i>. The defendant is exempt because the claim was for silver and he admitted to owing one <i>peruta</i> of copper; <b>that which he claimed from him, he did not admit to</b> at all, <b>and that which he admitted to, he had not claimed from him.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the latter clause:</b> If the claimant said: <b>I have two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i> <b>and one <i>peruta</i> in your possession,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>You have only one <i>peruta</i> in my possession,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the claim was for the <b>value</b> of two <i>ma’a</i>, <b>due to that</b> reason he is <b>liable</b> in this case; unlike the previous case, here the defendant denied a debt of two full <i>ma’a</i>. <b>But if you say</b> the claim was <b>specifically</b> for two silver <i>ma’a</i> and one copper <i>peruta</i>, <b>why</b> is he <b>liable</b> to take an oath? In this case too, <b>that which he claimed from him, he did not admit to</b> at all, <b>and that which he admitted to, he had not claimed from him.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Isn’t this discussion only according to Shmuel?</b> The proof was presented in order to attempt to refute the opinion of Shmuel, and <b>doesn’t Rav Naḥman say</b> that <b>Shmuel says</b> that if one <b>claimed</b> that another owes <b>him</b> both <b>wheat and barley, and</b> the defendant <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him one of them,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath? Here too, the claim was for two types of items, silver and copper, and the defendant admitted to owing one of the types, one <i>peruta</i> of copper. Therefore, according to Shmuel he is liable to take an oath.
<b>This, too, stands to reason, from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> that if the claimant said: <b>I have a <i>litra</i> of gold in your possession,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>You have only a <i>litra</i> of silver in my possession,</b> he is <b>exempt. Granted, if you say</b> that the mishna <b>is teaching</b> a case where the claim was <b>specifically</b> for gold, it is <b>due to that</b> reason that he is <b>exempt,</b> as the admission was of a different item from the claim. <b>But if you say</b> the claim was for the <b>value</b> of a <i>litra</i> of gold, <b>why</b> is he <b>exempt? A <i>litra</i> is a large</b> amount, and certainly both the claim and the denial are each worth more than two <i>ma’a</i>.
<b>Rather,</b> it is clearly a case where the claim was specifically for two silver <i>ma’a</i>, and <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> the claim was <b>specifically</b> for gold, it should be derived that <b>also</b> in <b>the former clause,</b> the claim was <b>specifically</b> for two <i>ma’a</i>.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>shall we say</b> this <b>is a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav?</b> The Gemara answers: No, <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>the entire mishna</b> is referring to claims in terms of the <b>value</b> of silver, not actual silver, <b>but</b> the case where the claim was for <b>a <i>litra</i> of gold is different.</b> All of the other cases in the mishna are referring to a certain monetary value, but this case is referring to actual gold, as a <i>litra</i> is not a coin or a monetary unit, but a measurement of weight.

Daf 40a

The Gemara discusses the basis for Rav’s explanation. <b>Know</b> that the mishna is referring to claims of monetary value, <b>as it teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> that if the claimant said: <b>I have a gold dinar in your possession,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>You have only a silver dinar, or a <i>tereisit</i>, or a <i>pundeyon</i>, or a <i>peruta</i> in my possession,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath, <b>as they are all</b> of <b>one type;</b> they are all <b>coins. Granted, if you say</b> that the claim was for the <b>value</b> of a gold dinar, it is <b>due to that</b> reason that he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath, as he admitted to a part of the claim. <b>But if you say</b> that the claim was <b>specifically</b> for a dinar of gold, <b>why</b> is he <b>liable?</b> The claim was for gold, and he admitted to owing silver or copper.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> This mishna is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> one <b>claimed</b> that the defendant owes <b>him a dinar of coins,</b> i.e., coins worth a dinar. The claim was for specific coins, and not a monetary value. Since the claim concerned coins and not a specific weight of metal, and all coins are used for commercial transactions, all types of coins are considered of the same type. <b>And</b> it <b>teaches us that a <i>peruta</i> is included in</b> the category of <b>a coin.</b> According to this explanation, the language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches:</b> The defendant is liable to take an oath, <b>as</b> they are <b>all</b> of <b>one type [<i>min</i>];</b> they are all <b>coins.</b> In other words, even a <i>peruta</i> is a type of coin.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>Rav,</b> who holds that the claim in this case was for the value of a dinar, explain the fact that the mishna states: As they are all of one type; they are all coins? Why does it matter that they are all of one type? The Gemara answers that according to Rav, the reason the defendant is liable to take an oath is that <b>because</b> the claim is for the value of a dinar, <b>all</b> descriptions of monetary value based on different coins have <b>one</b> status under <b><i>halakha</i> [<i>din</i>];</b> they are all <b>coins,</b> and it is of no significance that they are made of different materials.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> concerning the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, shall we say</b> that <b>since he explains the latter clause</b> in the mishna as referring to a specific item and not a value, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> then <b>also</b> with regard to <b>the former clause,</b> that states the claim must be for two silver <i>ma’a</i>, <b>he</b> apparently <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> i.e., that it is referring to two actual <i>ma’a</i>, and not the value of two <i>ma’a</i>?
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> Rabbi Elazar explains that <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna is referring <b>specifically</b> to actual items in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, <b>as it teaches</b> explicitly: <b>As</b> they are <b>all</b> of <b>one type;</b> they are all <b>coins. But the former clause</b> can be interpreted either <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav or in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof that a claim for a coin is referring to its value: It is taught in a <i>baraita</i> that if the claimant said: <b>I have a coined gold dinar in your possession,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>You have only a silver dinar in my possession,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath, as the claim and the admission are both referring to a coin. The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> this claim is referring specifically to a coin is <b>that</b> the claimant <b>says to him:</b> You owe me <b>a coined gold</b> dinar; <b>but</b> if the claim was for <b>an unspecified</b> gold dinar, i.e., without specifying that it was coined, the claimant <b>is saying to him</b> that he owes him an item with the <b>value</b> of a dinar, not necessarily a coin, in accordance with the opinion of Rav.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> in response that according to the opinion of Shmuel, <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Anyone who says: A gold dinar, is</b> considered <b>like one who says: A coined gold dinar;</b> i.e., he is referring to the coin and not to its value.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in support of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav:</b> If the claimant said: <b>I have a <i>sela</i> in your possession,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>You have only a <i>sela</i> minus two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i> <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath. If the defendant responded: I owe you only a <i>sela</i> <b>minus one</b> silver <b><i>ma’a</i>,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> Clearly, the reason is that he denied less than two <i>ma’a</i> of the claim, in accordance with the opinion of Rav.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The requirement that the claim be at least the value of two silver <i>ma’a</i> to render the defendant liable to take an oath was <b>taught only with regard to</b> a case where the oath is due to the <b>claim of</b> the <b>creditor and</b> the partial <b>admission of</b> the <b>debtor. But</b> in a case where the defendant’s liability to take an oath is due to the <b>claim of</b> the <b>creditor and</b> the <b>testimony of one witness</b> in support of the claim, <b>even</b> if the claimant <b>claimed from him only one <i>peruta</i>,</b> the defendant is <b>liable</b> to take an oath.
<b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? <b>As it is written: “One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). It is inferred from here that <b>it is for any iniquity or for any sin that he may not rise up,</b> as the testimony of one witness is not enough for this purpose, <b>but he may rise up to</b> render one liable to take <b>an oath. And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In <b>any place where two</b> witnesses <b>render</b> a defendant <b>liable</b> to pay <b>money,</b> the testimony of <b>one witness renders him liable</b> to take <b>an oath.</b> Therefore, since two witnesses render the defendant liable to pay if the claim is worth at least one <i>peruta</i>, so too, one witness renders him liable to take an oath with regard to a claim of this value.
§ <b>And Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If one <b>claimed</b> that another owed <b>him wheat and barley, and</b> the defendant <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him one of</b> these types, he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath, as he admitted to part of a claim.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said to him:</b> You have spoken <b>well, and so</b> also <b>said Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>By inference,</b> does this mean <b>that Reish Lakish disagrees with</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan with regard to this matter, since Rabbi Yitzḥak mentioned that Rabbi Yoḥanan agreed, and did not reference Reish Lakish, who often engages in disputes with Rabbi Yoḥanan? The Gemara answers: There is no record of Reish Lakish expressing his opinion at that time. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this is because <b>he was tarrying and remaining silent,</b> waiting for Rabbi Yoḥanan to finish his statement, and Rabbi Yitzḥak did not find out whether or not he subsequently disagreed with him, and <b>there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Reish Lakish <b>was drinking</b> at the time, <b>and he</b> therefore <b>remained silent</b> and did not respond to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement.
<b>Let us say</b> that the wording of the mishna <b>supports</b> Shmuel’s opinion: If one <b>claimed</b> that another owes <b>him wheat, and</b> the defendant <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him barley,</b> he is <b>exempt; and Rabban Gamliel deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to take an oath. The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> he is exempt according to the first <i>tanna</i> <b>is that he claimed</b> that he owes <b>him wheat and</b> the defendant <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him barley; but</b> if the claim was for both <b>wheat and barley, and</b> the defendant <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him one of them,</b> it can be inferred he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No,</b> it is possible that <b>the same is true,</b> i.e., <b>that even</b> if the claim was for both <b>wheat and barley</b> the defendant is <b>exempt. And</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna states <b>that</b> the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabban Gamliel <b>disagree with regard to</b> a case where the claim was specifically for <b>wheat</b> and the defendant admitted to owing him barley is in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel,</b> that the defendant is liable to take an oath even if his admission is not at all of the same type as the claim.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from the mishna: If one <b>claimed</b> that another owes <b>him vessels and land,</b> and the defendant <b>admitted to</b> owing him <b>vessels but denied</b> the claim of <b>land,</b> or conversely, if he admitted <b>to</b> owing him <b>land but denied</b> the claim of <b>vessels,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath.

Daf 40b

If <b>he admitted to part of</b> the claim about the <b>land,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> If he admitted <b>to part</b> of the claim about the <b>vessels,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath.
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> he is exempt in the first cases is <b>that</b> the claim was for <b>vessels and land, as</b> a claim with regard to <b>land is not subject to an oath; but</b> if the claim was for <b>vessels</b> of one type <b>and vessels</b> of another type, or for wheat and barley, <b>similar to</b> the case of a claim for <b>vessels and land</b> in that the defendant admitted to owing one type and denied owing the other type, he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath.
The Gemara rejects the inference: No, it is possible that <b>the same is true,</b> i.e., <b>that even</b> if the claim was for <b>vessels</b> of one type <b>and vessels</b> of another type, and the defendant admitted to owing one type and denied owing the other type, he is <b>exempt. And</b> the reason <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> specifically the case where the claim is for <b>vessels and land</b> is that this <b>teaches us that</b> in a case <b>where</b> the defendant <b>admitted to a part of</b> the claim with regard to the <b>vessels,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath <b>concerning the land as well.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <b>teaching us?</b> Does it teach the <i>halakha</i> that an admission to a part of the claim about vessels also <b>binds</b> the land to the oath? <b>We learn</b> this in a mishna in tractate <i>Kiddushin</i> (26a): When there is a claim against a person for movable property and land, and he is liable to take an oath concerning the movable property, the movable property <b>binds the property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land, so that he is forced <b>to take an oath concerning it</b> too.
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> mishna is the <b>primary</b> reference to this <i>halakha</i>, as it discusses the <i>halakhot</i> of oaths, whereas <b>that</b> mishna <b>cites it incidentally,</b> in the context of a broader survey of the difference between these two types of property.
<b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> disagrees with Shmuel and <b>says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>claimed</b> that another owes <b>him</b> both <b>wheat and barley, and</b> the latter <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him one of them,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yitzḥak say</b> to Rav Naḥman: You have spoken <b>well</b> in the name of Shmuel, i.e., in saying that the defendant is liable to take an oath in the aforementioned case; <b>and so</b> also <b>said Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b> If so, Rabbi Yoḥanan agrees with Shmuel, and not with Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba. The Gemara answers: <b>They are <i>amora’im</i>,</b> and they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof against the opinion of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba from the mishna: If one <b>claimed</b> that another owes <b>him wheat, and</b> the defendant <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him barley,</b> he is <b>exempt; and Rabban Gamliel deems</b> him <b>liable</b> to take an oath. The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> he is exempt <b>is that he claimed</b> that he owes <b>him wheat and</b> the defendant <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him barley; but</b> if the claim was for both <b>wheat and barley, and</b> the defendant <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him one of them,</b> he would be <b>liable</b> to take an oath.
The Gemara rejects this proof: It is possible that <b>the same is true,</b> i.e., <b>that even</b> if the claim was for both <b>wheat and barley</b> the defendant is <b>exempt. And</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> specifically <b>this</b> case, where the claim was specifically for wheat, is in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel,</b> as he holds that even in this case one is liable to take an oath.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from the mishna: If one <b>claimed</b> that another owes <b>him vessels and land, and</b> the defendant <b>admitted to</b> owing him <b>vessels but denied</b> the claim of <b>land,</b> or if he admitted <b>to</b> owing him <b>land but denied</b> the claim of <b>vessels,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath. If <b>he admitted to part</b> of the claim with regard to the <b>land,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> If he admitted <b>to part</b> of the claim with regard to the <b>vessels,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath. The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> he is exempt in the first cases is <b>that</b> the claim was for <b>vessels and land, as</b> a claim with regard to <b>land is not subject to an oath; but</b> if the claim was for <b>vessels</b> of one type <b>and vessels</b> of another type, <b>similar to</b> the case of a claim for <b>vessels and land</b> in that the defendant admitted to owing one type and denied owing the other type, he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath.
The Gemara rejects this: It is possible that <b>the same is true, that even</b> if the claim was for <b>vessels</b> of one type <b>and vessels</b> of another type he is <b>exempt. And</b> the mishna teaches specifically the case where the claim is for vessels and land because <b>this teaches us that</b> if the defendant <b>admitted to a part of</b> the claim with regard to the <b>vessels,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath <b>concerning the land as well.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <b>teaching us?</b> Does it teach the <i>halakha</i> that an admission to part of the claim about vessels also <b>binds</b> the land to the oath? <b>We learn</b> this in a mishna in tractate <i>Kiddushin</i> (26a): The movable property <b>binds the property that serves as a guarantee,</b> so that he is forced <b>to take an oath concerning it</b> too. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> mishna is the <b>primary</b> reference to this <i>halakha</i>, whereas <b>that</b> mishna <b>cites it incidentally.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>claimed</b> that another owes <b>him an ox, and</b> the latter <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him a sheep,</b> or conversely, if the claim was for <b>a sheep and</b> the defendant <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him an ox,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath. If one <b>claimed</b> that another owes <b>him an ox and a sheep, and</b> the defendant <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him one of them,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath.
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to him</b> in response: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel,</b> who deems the defendant liable to take an oath even if his admission was not of the same type of item as the claim. Rabbi Abba bar Memel responded: <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Gamliel,</b> the defendant should be liable to take an oath <b>even</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, where the claim is for an ox and the admission is with regard to a sheep.
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba explained: <b>Rather,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Admon,</b> who holds that the admission must be of the same type as the claim, and maintains nevertheless that in a case where one claims that another owes him jugs of oil, and the latter admits that he owes him jugs, but not the oil, the defendant is liable to take an oath (see 38b). <b>And I am not dismissing your</b> objection insubstantially; <b>rather, it is a set tradition in the mouth of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who would say: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Admon.</b>
§ <b>Rav Anan says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If one intended to claim from another wheat and barley, and <b>claimed</b> that he owes <b>him wheat, and</b> before he finished his claim, the defendant <b>first admitted</b> that he owes <b>him barley,</b> in this case, <b>if</b> the defendant did so <b>as one who employs artifice,</b> so that he would be exempt from taking an oath concerning the wheat, he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath. But <b>if</b> he did so <b>as one who intends</b> to respond to the claim, without any ulterior motive, he is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>And Rav Anan says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If one <b>claimed</b> that another owes <b>him two needles, and</b> the latter <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him one of them,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath. It is <b>for this reason</b> that <b>vessels were singled out</b> in the verse, <b>to</b> teach that one is liable to take an oath in a case of admission to part of a claim involving vessels of <b>any value.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> If one <b>claimed</b> that another owes <b>him vessels and</b> also <b>one <i>peruta</i>, and</b> the latter <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him</b> the <b>vessels but denied</b> the claim that he owes him the <b><i>peruta</i>,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath. If he <b>admitted</b> that he owes him <b>one <i>peruta</i> but denied</b> the claim that he owes him the <b>vessels,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath.
The Gemara comments: <b>One</b> of these rulings <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, and</b> the other <b>one is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel.</b> The former <b>one,</b> that if the defendant denied owing the <i>peruta</i> he is exempt, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who says</b> that <b>the denial of a claim</b> must be of least the value of <b>two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i> in order to render the defendant liable to take an oath. The latter <b>one,</b> that if he denied owing the vessels he is liable to take an oath, <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who says</b> that if one <b>claimed</b> that another owes <b>him</b> both <b>wheat and barley, and</b> the latter <b>admitted to</b> owing <b>him one of them,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath.
§ The mishna teaches that if the claimant said: <b>I have one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>Nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>exempt. Rav Naḥman says: And</b> the court <b>administers an oath of inducement [<i>heisset</i>],</b> an oath instituted by the Sages, <b>to him. What is the reason?</b> There is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>one does not make a claim unless he has</b> a valid case <b>against</b> the other party. Therefore, even though there is no admission to part of the claim, the defendant’s denial should be examined through an oath.
The Gemara objects: <b>On the contrary;</b> there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>a person does not exhibit insolence</b> by lying <b>in the presence of his creditor</b> to deny the entire debt. Therefore, the defendant’s denial of the entire claim suggests that he is telling the truth. The Gemara answers that a debtor’s categorical denial is not necessarily out of insolence; he may be temporarily <b>avoiding</b> paying <b>him.</b> He <b>rationalizes</b> doing so by saying to himself: I am avoiding him only <b>until</b> the time <b>that I have</b> enough money, <b>and</b> then <b>I will repay him.</b>
<b>Know</b> that denial of a debt is not considered an outright lie, <b>as Rav Idi bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says: One who denies</b> a claim <b>with regard to a loan is fit to bear witness</b> even if his denial is proven untrue. By contrast, one who denies a claim <b>with regard to a deposit</b> and is proven to be lying <b>is disqualified from bearing witness.</b> The distinction is clearly based on the aforementioned reasoning: A debtor who denies the debt may be avoiding payment until he has enough money, whereas a bailee who denies having been given a deposit clearly intends to steal the item.
<b>Rav Ḥaviva teaches</b> Rav Naḥman’s statement as referring <b>to the latter clause</b> in the mishna: If one said to another: <b>I have one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> and the latter <b>said to him: Yes,</b> and <b>the next day</b> the claimant <b>said to him: Give</b> the money <b>to me,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>I</b> already <b>gave it to you,</b> he is <b>exempt. And Rav Naḥman says:</b> Nevertheless, the court <b>administers an oath of inducement to him.</b>
The Gemara explains the difference between the two versions of Rav Naḥman’s statement: With regard to <b>the one who teaches</b> it in reference <b>to the former clause,</b> where the defendant denied the existence of the debt, <b>all the more so</b> does this <i>amora</i> agree that an oath of inducement is administered <b>in</b> the case of <b>the latter clause,</b> where the defendant admitted to the existence of the debt, and merely claimed that he paid it.

Daf 41a

<b>But the one who teaches it</b> in reference <b>to the latter clause</b> maintains that specifically <b>here,</b> in this case, an oath of inducement is administered to the defendant, <b>as</b> he admits that <b>there is</b> a matter of <b>financial association</b> between them; <b>but there,</b> in the case of the first clause, where the defendant maintains that the claim is baseless, and <b>there is no</b> matter of <b>financial association</b> between them, the court does <b>not</b> administer to him an oath of inducement.
§ The Gemara asks: Practically speaking, <b>what</b> difference <b>is there between an oath</b> administered <b>by Torah law and an oath</b> administered <b>by rabbinic</b> law, i.e., an oath of inducement? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them is</b> with regard to the <b>transfer of an oath</b> to the other party. In a case where the defendant suggests that instead of taking an oath himself, the claimant should take an oath and collect that which he claims, if the oath is administered <b>by Torah law, we do not transfer</b> the <b>oath</b> to the claimant; the defendant must either take an oath himself or pay. If the oath is administered <b>by rabbinic law, we</b> do <b>transfer</b> the oath.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Mar bar Rav Ashi, who says</b> that <b>we transfer an oath</b> that is administered <b>by Torah law as well, what</b> difference <b>is there between</b> an oath administered <b>by Torah law and</b> an oath administered <b>by rabbinic law?</b> The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them is</b> with regard to whether or not the court <b>enters the property of</b> the defendant to collect payment if he refuses to take an oath. <b>With regard to</b> an oath administered <b>by Torah law, we enter his property,</b> and <b>with regard to</b> an oath administered <b>by rabbinic law, we do not enter his property.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what is the practical difference <b>according to Rabbi Yosei, who says</b> that <b>even with regard to</b> a debt that is owed <b>by rabbinic law, we enter the property of</b> the debtor to collect the debt?
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 59b): <b>A lost item found</b> by <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor</b> is not acquired by him, since he lacks the legal competence to effect acquisition. Nevertheless, taking such an item from him <b>is considered robbery on account of the ways of peace.</b> Although these individuals lack halakhic competence and are unable to acquire lost items by Torah law, taking such items from them is considered robbery. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> This is <b>full-fledged robbery. And Rav Ḥisda says</b> that Rabbi Yosei means that it is <b>full-fledged robbery by rabbinic</b> law. Accordingly, <b>what is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> between the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yosei’s opinion there? The difference is that according to Rabbi Yosei, if one refuses to return the stolen item, <b>it is appropriated by the judges</b> and returned to the one who found it. The Gemara completes its question: Since according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei the court enters one’s property to appropriate even an item that is owed by rabbinic law, <b>what</b> difference <b>is there between</b> an oath administered <b>by Torah</b> law <b>and</b> an oath administered <b>by rabbinic</b> law?
The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them is</b> with regard to a case <b>where the one opposing</b> the claimant, the defendant, <b>is suspected with regard to oaths. With regard to</b> an oath administered <b>by Torah law,</b> if <b>the one opposing</b> the claimant <b>is suspected with regard to oaths, we transfer</b> the obligation to take <b>an oath and impose it on the other</b> litigant, i.e., the claimant, who may take an oath and collect that which he claims he is owed. <b>With regard to</b> an oath administered <b>by rabbinic</b> law, the court does not transfer the oath, as transference of an oath <b>is</b> by rabbinic <b>ordinance, and we do not institute</b> one rabbinic <b>ordinance upon</b> another rabbinic <b>ordinance.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the Rabbis who disagree with Rabbi Yosei, as they say</b> that <b>with regard to</b> an item that is owed <b>by rabbinic law, we do not enter his property</b> to collect the item, <b>what do we do to</b> one who refuses to take an oath of inducement? The Gemara answers: <b>We excommunicate him</b> until he takes an oath.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: This</b> sanction is no less severe than entering his property and collecting the debt; it <b>is</b> like <b>grabbing him by his testicles [<i>bekhuveseih</i>]</b> until <b>he surrenders his cloak. Rather, what do we do to him?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: We excommunicate him until the time to flog him comes,</b> i.e., for thirty days, <b>and</b> if he still refuses to take an oath or reach a settlement with the claimant, <b>we flog him and</b> then <b>leave him</b> alone.
§ <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> With regard to <b>one who produced</b> a promissory <b>note against another</b> in court, <b>and</b> the defendant <b>said to him:</b> The debt in <b>the note is</b> already <b>repaid,</b> but for some reason I did not get the promissory note returned to me when I paid you, <b>we say to</b> the defendant: <b>It is not in your power</b> to deny the debt; <b>go pay. But if</b> the defendant <b>said: Let him take an oath to me</b> that I did not repay him, <b>we say to</b> the claimant: <b>Take an oath to him.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: But what is</b> the difference <b>between this</b> case <b>and</b> the case of <b>one who vitiates his</b> promissory <b>note</b> by acknowledging that he has received partial payment? In the latter case, the Sages instituted that the creditor can collect the remainder of the debt only after taking an oath that he was not repaid more than the amount he admitted receiving. According to Rav Pappa, an oath can be administered to any creditor who produces a promissory note, even if he did not vitiate it.
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: There,</b> in the case of a creditor who vitiated his promissory note, <b>even if</b> the defendant <b>does not himself make a claim</b> demanding that the creditor take an oath, <b>we,</b> the court, <b>make</b> such <b>a claim on his</b> behalf. <b>Here,</b> in a case where the creditor did not vitiate his promissory note, <b>we say to</b> the defendant: <b>Go pay him</b> the debt, <b>but if</b> the defendant <b>demands</b> an oath, <b>saying: Take an oath to me, we say to</b> the creditor: <b>Go take an oath to him. And if he is a Torah scholar [<i>tzurva merabbanan</i>], we do not administer an oath to him.</b>
<b>Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi: Can a Torah scholar uncloak people?</b> Does his being a Torah scholar give him the right to collect money that the defendant claims he does not owe? <b>Rather,</b> if he is a Torah scholar <b>we do not attend to his case.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that if the claimant said: <b>I have one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> and the defendant initially acknowledged the debt, but when he claimed the money the next day the defendant said that he already repaid him, the defendant is exempt from taking an oath. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says:</b> In the case of <b>one who lends</b> money to <b>another in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> the latter is <b>required to repay him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses.</b> Therefore, if there are no witnesses to the fact that he repaid him, he is liable. Rav Yehuda continues: <b>When I said this in the presence of Shmuel, he said to me</b> that the debtor <b>can say to</b> the claimant: <b>I repaid you in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so, and they went overseas.</b>
The Gemara raises an objection to Rav Asi’s statement: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that in a case where the claimant said: <b>I have one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> and the latter <b>said to him: Yes,</b> and <b>the next day</b> the claimant <b>said to him: Give</b> the money <b>to me,</b> if the defendant responded: <b>I gave it to you,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>And here, since</b> the claimant <b>claimed</b> the debt from the defendant <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> and the latter admitted the debt, <b>he is similar to one who lent him</b> the money <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses, and</b> nevertheless, the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the defendant is <b>exempt.</b>

Daf 41b

Evidently, he is not required to repay him in the presence of witnesses. The Gemara suggests: This is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Asi.</b>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Rav Asi</b> could have <b>said to you: When I said</b> that the debtor is liable to repay him in the presence of witnesses, it was with regard to a case <b>where</b> the creditor <b>lent</b> the money to <b>him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses at the outset, as he did not trust him.</b> But <b>here, he trusted him</b> at the outset, as he lent it to him in the absence of witnesses. Therefore, the debtor is not required to repay the debt in the presence of witnesses.
<b>Rav Yosef teaches</b> another version of this discussion, <b>like this: Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says:</b> In the case of <b>one who lends</b> money to <b>another in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> the latter <b>need not repay him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses. But if</b> the creditor <b>said: Repay me only in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> the debtor is <b>required to repay him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses.</b> Rav Yehuda continued: <b>When I said this in the presence of Shmuel, he said to me</b> that the debtor <b>can say to</b> the claimant: <b>I repaid you in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so, and they went overseas.</b>
The Gemara raises an objection against Shmuel’s opinion: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that in a case where the claimant said: <b>I have one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> and the defendant <b>said to him: Yes,</b> and the claimant then <b>said to him: Give</b> the money <b>to me only in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> then if <b>the next day</b> the claimant <b>said to him: Give</b> the money <b>to me,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>I</b> already <b>gave it to you,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay, <b>as</b> he is <b>required to give</b> it <b>to him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses.</b> The Gemara suggests: This is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Shmuel.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that it <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the creditor said to the debtor: <b>I lent</b> the money to <b>you in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses</b> and therefore you must <b>repay me in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> the debtor must <b>either give</b> him the money <b>or bring proof that</b> he already <b>gave</b> it to him. <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says</b> that <b>he can say to him: I repaid you in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so, and they</b> subsequently <b>went overseas.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa refutes</b> this answer: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is referring to</b> a case where the creditor said this <b>at the time of the loan? Perhaps</b> it <b>is referring to</b> a case where he made no stipulation at the time of the loan, but rather said this <b>at the time of the claim,</b> when the debtor claimed that he had repaid the debt; <b>and this</b> is what <b>he says to him: Didn’t I lend</b> the money <b>you in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses? You should have repaid me in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses. But</b> if he made this stipulation <b>at the time of the loan, all agree</b> that the debtor is <b>liable.</b> Therefore, there is no evidence that Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira agrees with the opinion of Shmuel.
In conclusion, <b>Rav Pappi says in the name of Rava: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that if one <b>lends</b> money to <b>another in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> the latter is <b>required to repay him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses. And Rav Pappa says in the name of Rava:</b> In the case of <b>one who lends</b> money to <b>another in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> the latter is <b>not required to repay him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses. But if</b> the creditor <b>says: Repay me only in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> the debtor is <b>required to repay him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses. And if he said to him: I repaid you in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so, and they went overseas,</b> his claim is <b>deemed credible.</b>
§ The Gemara cites several incidents involving loans and witnesses, and provides a <b>mnemonic</b> device for them: <b>Reuven and Shimon, who learned <i>halakha</i>, borrowed, and repaid so-and-so and so-and-so gallnuts</b> for <b>a different</b> debt, <b>deeming them credible like two</b> witnesses.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> creditor <b>who said to</b> the debtor: <b>When you repay me, repay me in the presence of Reuven and Shimon.</b> The debtor <b>went and repaid him in the presence of two</b> other witnesses <b>from the general public.</b> When the case was brought before the Sages, <b>Abaye said:</b> The creditor <b>said to</b> the debtor to repay him <b>in the presence of two</b> people who would serve as witnesses, and <b>he repaid him in the presence of two</b> people. Therefore, the creditor has no further claim. <b>Rava said to him:</b> It is <b>for this</b> reason that the creditor <b>said to him</b> to repay him <b>in the presence of Reuven and Shimon: So that he will not</b> be able to <b>dismiss him</b> by saying that he repaid him in the presence of other witnesses.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> creditor <b>who said to</b> the debtor: <b>When you repay me, repay me in the presence of two</b> people <b>who</b> have <b>learned <i>halakha</i>.</b> The debtor <b>went</b> and <b>repaid him between the two of them,</b> i.e., in the absence of witnesses. <b>Those dinars were</b> subsequently taken from the creditor due to <b>circumstances beyond his control.</b>
The creditor <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> for judgment, and <b>said to him: Yes, I received</b> the money <b>from him;</b> but since he did not repay me as stipulated, I accepted it only <b>as a deposit.</b> I accepted it as an unpaid bailee, not as payment, <b>and said</b> to myself: <b>Let it be with me as a deposit until two</b> people <b>who</b> have <b>learned <i>halakha</i> happen</b> to arrive, <b>and</b> the debtor <b>will fulfill his condition.</b> Since the money was taken from me due to circumstances beyond my control, and I had it in my possession only as an unpaid bailee, I am not responsible for it, and the debtor is still liable to repay me.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Since you admit that you certainly took</b> the money <b>from him, it is a proper repayment. If you say</b> that the debtor is still required <b>to fulfill his condition, go bring</b> the money now, <b>as Rav Sheshet and I</b> have <b>learned <i>halakha</i>, and <i>Sifra</i>, and <i>Sifrei</i>, and <i>Tosefta</i>, and the entire Talmud.</b> Let him give you the money in our presence, and the condition will thereby be fulfilled. Since he gave you the money intending to repay the debt, and did not agree to entrust it to you as an unpaid bailee, your claim is not valid.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: Give me</b> the <b>hundred dinars that I lent you.</b> The latter <b>said to him:</b> This <b>matter never happened;</b> you did not lend me money. The creditor <b>went</b> and <b>brought witnesses who</b> testified that <b>he lent</b> the money to <b>him and</b> that the debtor had <b>repaid him. Abaye said: What</b> is there for the court to <b>do</b> in this case? The same witnesses said both statements; <b>they said</b> that the creditor <b>lent him</b> the money, and <b>they</b> also <b>said</b> that the debtor <b>repaid him. Rava said: Anyone who says: I did not borrow, is</b> considered <b>like</b> one who <b>says: I did not repay.</b> Since there is testimony that he borrowed the money, and he admits that he did not repay it, he is liable to repay the debt.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: Give me</b> the <b>hundred dinars that I claim from you.</b> The latter <b>said to him: Didn’t I repay you in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so?</b> The two people he mentioned, <b>so-and-so and so-and-so, came</b> and <b>said:</b> This <b>matter never happened. Rav Sheshet thought to say</b> that based on the testimony of the witnesses, the debtor <b>assumes the presumptive status of one who</b> falsely <b>denies</b> his debts; his claim that he repaid the debt is no longer accepted, and he is liable to pay. <b>Rava said to him: Anything that is not incumbent upon a person is not on his mind,</b> i.e., he is apt to forget it.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: Give me</b> the <b>six hundred dinars that I claim from you.</b> The latter <b>said to him: But didn’t I repay you</b> with <b>one hundred <i>kav</i></b>

Daf 42a

of <b>gallnuts [<i>aftzei</i>] that were</b> worth <b>six</b> dinars for <b>each</b> <i>kav</i> at the time? The creditor <b>said to him: Weren’t they</b> worth <b>four</b> dinars for <b>each</b> <i>kav</i> at the time? <b>Two witnesses came and said: Yes, they were</b> worth <b>four</b> dinars per <i>kav</i>. <b>Rava said</b> that the debtor <b>assumes the presumptive status of one who</b> falsely <b>denies</b> his debts. <b>Rami bar Ḥama said: But didn’t you say</b> that <b>anything that is not incumbent upon a person is not on his mind?</b> Perhaps he merely forgot what the price of gallnuts was at the time that he paid. <b>Rava said to him: People remember the</b> standard, <b>set</b> market <b>price.</b>
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: Give me</b> the <b>hundred dinars that I claim from you, and this is the</b> promissory <b>note</b> attesting to the debt. The latter <b>said to him: I</b> already <b>repaid you.</b> The creditor <b>said to him: That</b> money you gave me <b>was</b> for <b>a different</b> debt. <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>the</b> promissory <b>note is undermined</b> by the fact that the creditor admits that he received payment equal to the amount specified in the note, and his claim that there was an additional debt is unsubstantiated. <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the</b> promissory <b>note is not undermined.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Rav Pappa,</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the incident where <b>a certain</b> person <b>said to another: Give me</b> the <b>hundred dinars that I claim from you, and this is the</b> promissory <b>note.</b> The latter <b>said to him: Didn’t you give me</b> that money as an investment to be used <b>for</b> buying <b>oxen</b> to be slaughtered? <b>And you came and sat in the slaughterhouse and received your money,</b> including your share of the profits, from the sale of the slaughtered oxen. <b>And</b> the creditor <b>said to him: That</b> money you gave me <b>was</b> for <b>a different</b> debt. <b>And Rav Pappa said</b> that in that case <b>the</b> promissory <b>note is undermined.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>There, since</b> the debtor <b>said: You gave me</b> the money <b>for oxen and you took</b> payment <b>from oxen,</b> and the creditor admitted that this had happened, <b>the</b> promissory <b>note is undermined</b> because there is no support for his claim that there was another debt in addition to the acknowledged transaction for the oxen. <b>Here, say</b> that the payment <b>was</b> in fact for <b>a different</b> debt.
<b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Rav Pappi said: The</b> promissory <b>note is not undermined,</b> and <b>Rav Sheshet, son of Rav Idi, said: The</b> promissory <b>note is undermined. And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>the</b> promissory <b>note is undermined.</b>
<b>And this statement</b> applies in a case <b>where he repaid him in the presence of witnesses and did not mention the</b> promissory <b>note to</b> the creditor; <b>but</b> in a case where <b>he repaid him</b> privately, <b>between the two of them,</b> in the absence of witnesses, <b>since [<i>miggo</i>]</b> the creditor <b>can say to him:</b> This <b>matter never happened,</b> i.e., he could deny that he received any payment, <b>he can also say</b> that <b>this</b> money was for <b>a different</b> debt. <b>And</b> this is <b>like</b> the case involving <b>Avimi, son of Rabbi Abbahu,</b> who repaid a debt in the absence of witnesses, and the creditor then claimed that the payment was for another debt (see <i>Ketubot</i> 85a).
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another</b> who had lent him money: <b>I deem you credible whenever you say to me</b> that <b>I did not repay</b> the debt. He then <b>went</b> and <b>repaid</b> the debt <b>in the presence of witnesses,</b> and the creditor later denied that he had been repaid. <b>Abaye and Rava both say</b> that the witnesses are not deemed credible and the creditor can collect payment, as the debtor <b>deemed him credible</b> at the outset. <b>Rav Pappa objects to this</b> and says: <b>Although he deemed him more credible than himself</b> concerning the possibility that the debtor would claim that he repaid the debt and the creditor would deny having been repaid, <b>did he deem him more credible than witnesses?</b> Therefore, he is exempt.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another</b> who had lent him money: <b>I deem you credible like two</b> witnesses <b>whenever you say</b> that <b>I did not repay</b> the debt. <b>He went</b> and <b>repaid</b> the debt <b>in the presence of three</b> witnesses. <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that the creditor cannot deny the testimony of three witnesses, as the debtor <b>deemed him credible like two</b> witnesses; <b>he did not deem him credible like three</b> witnesses.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rav Pappa: Say</b> that although <b>the Sages say that we follow the majority of opinions,</b> and the opinion of three people is therefore accepted against the opinion of two, <b>this statement</b> applies <b>with regard to assessing</b> value, <b>as the more</b> people there are, <b>the more knowledgeable they are. But with regard to testimony, one hundred</b> witnesses <b>are like two, and two are like one hundred.</b> Therefore, in this case there is no distinction between two witnesses and three witnesses.
The Gemara presents <b>another version</b> of the incident: <b>A certain</b> person <b>said to another</b> who had lent him money: <b>I deem you credible like two</b> witnesses <b>whenever you say</b> that <b>I did not repay. He went and repaid</b> the debt <b>in the presence of three</b> witnesses. <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that the creditor cannot deny their testimony, as the debtor <b>deemed him credible like two</b> witnesses; <b>he did not deem him credible like three</b> witnesses.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, objects to this: Two</b> witnesses <b>are like one hundred, and one hundred are like two. But if</b> the debtor <b>said to</b> the creditor that he deems him credible <b>like three</b> witnesses, <b>and</b> then <b>went</b> and <b>repaid him in the presence of four,</b> then <b>once he entered,</b> by mentioning a larger number than what is necessary for testimony, the realm of <b>opinions,</b> in which three people carry greater weight than two, <b>he has entered</b> the realm of <b>opinions,</b> and four witnesses are deemed more credible than three. Therefore, the creditor is not deemed credible against them.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One does not take an oath concerning the claim of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, and</b> the court <b>does not administer an oath to a minor.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason?</b> The Gemara answers that in the passage from which the <i>halakhot</i> of admission to part of a claim are derived, <b>the verse states: “If a man delivers to his neighbor silver or vessels to safeguard”</b> (Exodus 22:6). The word “man” indicates that the reference is only to adults, and <b>delivery by a minor is nothing,</b> i.e., it is not recognized as a halakhically significant act, as a minor is not halakhically competent.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But one does take an oath to a minor, or to</b> a representative of <b>the Temple</b> treasury with regard to consecrated property. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you say</b> in <b>the first clause</b> that <b>one does not take an oath concerning the claim of</b> a deaf-mute, <b>an imbecile, or a minor?</b>
<b>Rav said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that one takes an oath concerning the claim of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor is <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>comes</b> to court <b>with a claim</b> for a debt owed <b>to his</b> late <b>father, and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> There are <b>times when</b> although no one claimed of a person that he owes money, that <b>person takes an oath on</b> the basis of <b>his own claim. How</b> so? If one <b>said to</b> another: <b>Your father had one hundred dinars in my possession, but I provided him</b> with repayment of <b>half</b> that amount, he is liable to <b>take an oath</b> that he repaid half; <b>and that is</b> the case of one <b>who takes an oath on</b> the basis of <b>his own claim. And the Rabbis say:</b> In that case <b>he is only like one returning a lost item,</b> as the son did not claim the money at all, <b>and</b> is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath.
The Gemara asks: <b>But is Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov not of</b> the opinion that <b>one who returns a lost item</b> is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath attesting to the fact that he did not take anything from it? <b>Rav said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where a minor advanced a claim</b> against <b>him.</b> The creditor’s minor son claimed that the debtor did not repay any part of the loan to his father. The debtor’s partial admission came in response to that claim. Therefore, his admission is not comparable to the act of returning a lost item.
The Gemara asks: How can the <i>baraita</i> be referring to the claim of <b>a minor? But didn’t you say</b> in the mishna that <b>one does not take an oath concerning the claim of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the reference is to <b>an adult</b> son; <b>and why did</b> Rav <b>call him a minor?</b> It was due to the fact <b>that with regard to his father’s matters,</b> one <b>is</b> like <b>a minor,</b> as he is uncertain about the particulars of his father’s dealings. Here, too, Rav explains that the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna that one takes an oath to a minor is referring to an adult claiming a debt owed to his late father.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the son making the claim has already reached majority, the language of the <i>baraita</i> is imprecise. Why does the <i>tanna</i> describe the individual as one taking an oath on the basis of <b>his own claim?</b> This is not his own claim; <b>it is the claim of others.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> employed that language because although it is <b>the claim of others,</b> he is taking an oath on the basis of that claim <b>and his own</b> partial <b>admission.</b>

Daf 42b

The Gemara challenges: <b>All</b> other cases where the defendant is required to take an oath due to a partial admission are <b>also</b> cases of <b>a claim of others and his own admission.</b> Yet in the <i>baraita</i> Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov introduces his opinion with the term: There are times, indicating that the case to which he is referring, of one taking an oath on the basis of his own claim, is not the standard case of an oath due to a partial admission.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> the statement <b>of Rabba, as Rabba says: For what</b> reason <b>did the Torah say</b> that one who <b>admits to a part of the claim must take an oath?</b> It is because there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>a person does not exhibit insolence</b> by lying <b>in the presence of his creditor,</b> who did him a favor by lending money to him. <b>And this</b> person who denies part of the claim actually <b>wants to deny all of</b> the debt, so as to be exempt, <b>and this</b> fact, i.e., <b>that he does not deny</b> all of <b>it,</b> is <b>because a person does not exhibit insolence in the presence of his creditor.</b>
Rabba continues: <b>And</b> in order not to exhibit insolence, he <b>wants to admit to</b> the creditor <b>with regard to all of</b> the debt; <b>and this</b> fact, i.e., <b>that he did not admit</b> the entire debt <b>to him,</b> is because he may be temporarily <b>avoiding</b> paying <b>him.</b> He <b>rationalizes</b> doing so by saying to himself: I am avoiding him only <b>until</b> the time <b>that I have</b> enough <b>money, and</b> then <b>I will repay him. And</b> therefore, <b>the Merciful One says</b> in the Torah: <b>Impose an oath on him in order</b> to induce the debtor <b>to admit the entire</b> debt <b>to him.</b>
With regard to this principle, <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov maintains:</b> It <b>is no different with regard to</b> the creditor <b>himself, and</b> it <b>is no different with regard to his son;</b> the debtor <b>would not exhibit insolence</b> and deny the debt. <b>And therefore, he is not</b> deemed as <b>one returning a lost item</b> on his own initiative; rather, this is an ordinary case where one admits to a part of a claim and is therefore required to take an oath. <b>And the Rabbis maintain: It is in the presence of</b> the original creditor <b>that</b> one <b>would not exhibit insolence; but in the presence of his son,</b> who did not lend him the money, he would <b>exhibit insolence</b> and deny the claim entirely. <b>And since</b> this debtor <b>is not exhibiting insolence,</b> as he could have denied the loan completely but instead is opting to admit to part of the claim, <b>he is</b> deemed as <b>one returning a lost item,</b> and his claim is accepted without his taking an oath.
The Gemara asks: <b>Can you interpret</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov? Isn’t it taught</b> in <b>the former clause</b> that if the claimant said: My late <b>father had one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> and the defendant responded: <b>You have only fifty dinars in my possession,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath, <b>as he is</b> like <b>one returning a lost item?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the claimant <b>did not say: I am certain</b> that you owe my father this money, but rather made an uncertain claim. In such a case, Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov agrees that the defendant is like one returning a lost item. <b>Here,</b> by contrast, it is a case <b>where he said: I am certain</b> that you owe him.
Returning to the Gemara’s question with regard to the last clause of the mishna, which states that one takes an oath to a minor, or to a representative of the Temple treasury, <b>Shmuel said</b> a different answer: When the mishna spoke about taking an oath <b>to a minor,</b> it was referring to a case where the debtor died; the creditor must take an oath to the minor heir attesting that he was not repaid in order <b>to collect from</b> the <b>minor’s property.</b> Similarly, if one’s debtor consecrated his property, he takes an oath <b>to</b> a representative of <b>the Temple</b> treasury in order <b>to collect from the consecrated property.</b>
The Gemara challenges: The <i>halakha</i> that one takes an oath <b>to a minor</b> in order <b>to collect from a minor’s property</b> is one that <b>we learn</b> in the mishna (45a): A woman who comes to collect the payment for her marriage contract <b>from the property of orphans collects only by means of an oath. Why do I</b> need <b>two</b> <i>mishnayot</i> to teach this <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara answers: By mentioning this <i>halakha</i> twice, the Mishna <b>teaches us this:</b> The <i>halakha</i> applies with regard to both minor and adult orphans, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Abaye the Elder; as Abaye the Elder taught:</b> The <b>orphans of which</b> the Sages <b>spoke</b> are <b>adult</b> orphans, <b>and needless to say,</b> the same <i>halakha</i> also applies to <b>minor</b> orphans. This principle applies <b>with regard to both</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a debt can be collected from the property of an orphan only by means of <b>an oath, and to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a debt can be collected from the property of an orphan only from <b>inferior-quality</b> land.
With regard to Shmuel’s explanation of the mishna that one takes an oath <b>to</b> a representative of <b>the Temple</b> treasury in order <b>to collect</b> a debt <b>from consecrated property,</b> the Gemara asks: <b>We learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna (45a): <b>From liened property</b> that has been sold one <b>collects</b> a debt <b>only by means of an oath. And what</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> whether the property was <b>liened to an ordinary</b> person, <b>and what</b> difference is it <b>to me</b> whether the property was <b>liened to the Most High,</b> i.e., it was consecrated?
The Gemara answers: It <b>was necessary</b> for this <i>halakha</i> to be stated separately with regard to collecting a debt from the Temple treasury. Otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>it is</b> specifically in order to collect a debt from <b>an ordinary</b> person that one is required to take an oath, <b>as a person</b> is liable to <b>collude</b> with another <b>against an ordinary</b> person who purchased property, by producing a promissory note for a debt that was already repaid in order to collect property from the purchasers of land that had been liened to that debt. <b>But</b> one might have thought that in order to collect a debt from the <b>Temple</b> treasury, a person is not required to take an oath, <b>as a person does not collude</b> with another <b>against</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasury. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that one is required to take an oath even in order to collect a debt from the Temple treasury, as one is suspected of collusion in this case as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rav Huna say</b> that in the case of <b>a person on his deathbed who consecrated all of his property, and said: So-and-so has one hundred dinars in my possession,</b> his statement is <b>deemed credible,</b> as the <b>presumption</b> is that <b>a person does not collude</b> with another <b>against</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasury? The Sages <b>said</b> in response: <b>That statement</b> applies only in the case of <b>a person on his deathbed, as a person sins only for his own</b> benefit. One is not suspected of deceiving the Temple treasury for the benefit of his heirs. <b>But with regard to a healthy person, we are certainly concerned</b> about collusion, even against the Temple treasury.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And these are items concerning which one does not take an oath</b> by Torah law: Canaanite <b>slaves, and</b> financial <b>documents, and land, and consecrated</b> property. <b>In</b> a case where <b>these</b> items are stolen, <b>there is no payment of double</b> the principal, <b>nor is there payment of four or five</b> times the principal in a case where one stole a consecrated animal and slaughtered or sold it. <b>An unpaid bailee</b> who lost one of these items <b>does not take an oath</b> that he was not negligent in safeguarding it, and <b>a paid bailee does not pay</b> for the loss or theft of one of these items.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> there is a distinction between different types of consecrated property: With regard to <b>consecrated</b> property <b>for which</b> one <b>bears</b> the financial <b>responsibility</b> to compensate the Temple treasury in the event <b>of their</b> loss, such as in a case where he vowed to bring an offering and then set aside an animal to be sacrificed in fulfillment of the vow, <b>one takes an oath concerning them,</b> as they are considered his own property. <b>But</b> with regard to consecrated property <b>for which</b> he <b>does not bear</b> the financial <b>responsibility for their</b> loss, <b>one does not take an oath concerning them.</b>
<b>Rabbi Meir says: There are</b> certain <b>items that are</b> physically <b>on the land but are not</b> treated <b>like land</b> from a halakhic perspective, <b>and the Rabbis do not concede to him</b> concerning this point. <b>How so?</b> If one makes the claim: <b>I assigned you ten grapevines laden</b> with fruit to safeguard, <b>and the other one says: They are only five</b> vines, <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> the defendant <b>liable</b> to take <b>an oath,</b> as he admitted to a part of the claim, and although the claim concerned grapevines, the primary aspect of the claim was the grapes. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The halakhic status of <b>anything that is attached to the land is like the land</b> itself, and therefore he is exempt from taking an oath.
<b>One takes an oath only concerning an item that is</b> defined <b>by size, by weight, or by number. How so?</b> If the claimant says: <b>I transferred to you a house full</b> of produce, <b>or: I transferred to you a pouch full</b> of money, <b>and the other</b> person <b>says: I do not know</b> how much you gave me, <b>but what you left</b> in my possession <b>you may take,</b> and the amount in the house or pouch at that time is less than that claimed by the claimant, the defendant is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath, as the amounts in the claim and the admission are undefined. But if <b>this</b> party <b>says</b> that the house was full <b>up to the ledge, and that</b> party <b>says</b> that it was full <b>up to the window,</b> the defendant is <b>liable</b> to take an oath, as the dispute relates to a defined amount.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From where do we</b> derive that one is exempt from the <b>payment of double</b> the principal with regard to the items mentioned in the mishna? It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse that discusses double payment: “For every matter of trespass, whether it be for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for clothing, or for any manner of lost thing…he shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8). This verse is expounded in the following manner: The phrase <b>“for every matter of trespass” is a generalization;</b> the phrase <b>“whether it be for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for clothing” is a detail;</b> and when the verse states: <b>“Or for any manner of lost thing,” it then generalized again.</b>
Consequently, this verse contains <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> and one of the thirteen principles of exegesis states that in such a case <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail.</b> Applying this principle here, one may conclude that <b>just as</b> each of the items mentioned in the <b>detail</b> is clearly <b>defined as an item that is movable</b> property <b>and has intrinsic monetary</b> value, <b>so too, anything that is movable</b> property <b>and has intrinsic monetary</b> value is subject to double payment.
<b>Land is</b> therefore <b>excluded, as it is not movable property.</b> Canaanite <b>slaves are</b> also <b>excluded, as they are compared to land</b> in many areas of <i>halakha</i>. Financial <b>documents are excluded, since although they are movable property, they do not have intrinsic monetary</b> value. The value of the paper itself is negligible; documents are valuable only because they serve as proof of monetary claims. Finally, <b>consecrated</b> property is excluded because it <b>is written</b> in the verse: “He shall pay double to <b>his neighbor,”</b> i.e., to his fellow man, but not to a representative of the Temple treasury.
The mishna teaches: <b>And there is no payment of double</b> the principal, <b>nor</b> is there payment of <b>four or five</b> times the principal for stealing consecrated animals. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the exclusion of the payment of four or five times the principal? The Gemara answers: Since payment of double the principal is excluded, that leaves, in a case where one steals and then slaughters or sells a consecrated animal, a total payment of only three or four times the principal, as the payment of double the principal is included in the larger payment for selling or slaughtering it. Therefore, since <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah <b>fourfold or fivefold payment, and not threefold or fourfold payment,</b> one who steals a consecrated animal and slaughters it or sells it is exempt from the additional payments.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>An unpaid bailee</b> who lost one of the excluded items <b>does not take an oath.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers that it is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 43a

The verse introduces the <i>halakhot</i> with regard to an unpaid bailee with the phrase: “If a man delivers to his neighbor silver or vessels to safeguard” (Exodus 22:6). The phrase <b>“if a man delivers to his neighbor” is a generalization, “silver or vessels” is a detail,</b> and when the verse states: <b>“To safeguard,” it then generalized</b> again. Consequently, this verse contains <b>a generalization and a detail and a generalization,</b> in which case <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail.</b> Applying this principle here, one concludes that <b>just as</b> each of the items mentioned in the <b>detail</b> is clearly <b>defined as an item that is movable</b> property <b>and has intrinsic monetary</b> value, <b>so too,</b> an unpaid bailee takes an oath concerning <b>anything that is movable</b> property <b>and has intrinsic monetary</b> value.
<b>Land is</b> therefore <b>excluded, as it is not movable property.</b> Canaanite <b>slaves are excluded, as they are compared to land</b> in many areas of <i>halakha</i>. Financial <b>documents are excluded, since although they are movable property, they do not have intrinsic monetary</b> value. <b>Consecrated</b> property is excluded because it <b>is written</b> in the verse: “If a man delivers to <b>his neighbor.”</b> This term indicates that both the one depositing the item and the bailee must be people, and not the Temple treasury.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>a paid bailee does not pay</b> for the loss or theft of one of these items. The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse introduces the <i>halakhot</i> with regard to a paid bailee with the phrase: “If a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep, or any animal to guard” (Exodus 22:9). The phrase <b>“if a man delivers to his neighbor” is a generalization,</b> the phrase <b>“a donkey, or an ox, or a sheep” is a detail,</b> and when the verse states: <b>“Or any animal to safeguard,” it then generalized</b> again. Consequently, this verse contains <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> which excludes any item that is not similar to the detail, as delineated in the previous <i>baraita</i> with regard to an unpaid bailee, <b>up to</b> and including the last clause of that <i>baraita</i>: <b>Consecrated</b> property is excluded because it <b>is written</b> in the verse: “If a man delivers to <b>his neighbor.”</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Meir says: There are</b> certain <b>items that are like land</b> with regard to their form, <b>but are not</b> treated <b>like land</b> from a halakhic perspective; and the Rabbis do not concede that this is so, as they hold that the halakhic status of anything that is attached to the land is like the land itself. The Gemara challenges: <b>By inference, does Rabbi Meir hold</b> that the halakhic status of <b>anything that is attached to the land is not like land?</b> If so, <b>rather than disagreeing with regard to</b> grapevines <b>laden</b> with fruit, <b>let them disagree with regard to fruitless</b> vines, as Rabbi Meir holds that the halakhic status of the vines themselves is not like that of the land.
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that <b>they disagree here</b> not with regard to any item that is attached to the land, as Rabbi Meir concedes that such items usually have the halakhic status of the land itself. The dispute is specifically <b>with regard to grapes that are ready to be harvested, as Rabbi Meir holds</b> that their halakhic status is <b>similar to</b> that of grapes that are already <b>harvested, and the Rabbis hold</b> that their halakhic status is <b>not similar to</b> that of grapes that are already <b>harvested,</b> and that they still have the status of land.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>one takes an oath only concerning an item that is</b> defined <b>by size, by weight,</b> or by number. How so? If the claimant says: I delivered to you a house full of produce, and the other person says: I do not know how much you gave me, but what you left in my possession you may take, and the amount in the house is less that that claimed by the claimant, the defendant is exempt from taking an oath. <b>Abaye said: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the claimant <b>said to him:</b> I gave you <b>a house</b> full of produce, <b>without specification. But</b> if <b>he said to him:</b> I gave you <b>this</b> specific <b>house full</b> of produce, <b>his claim is known</b> and defined, and the defendant is therefore required to take an oath concerning it.
<b>Rava said to him: If so, rather than teaching</b> in <b>the last clause</b> of the mishna: If <b>this</b> party <b>says</b> that the house was full <b>up to the ledge, and that</b> party <b>says</b> that it was full <b>up to the window,</b> the defendant is <b>liable</b> to take an oath, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>distinguish and teach</b> the distinction <b>within</b> the case <b>itself,</b> where the claim was for a house full of produce, and say: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that the defendant is exempt, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>in</b> a case where the claim was for an unspecified <b>house full</b> of produce; <b>but</b> if the claim was for <b>this</b> particular <b>house full</b> of produce, the defendant is <b>liable</b> to take an oath. Since the mishna did not make this distinction, evidently the defendant is exempt even if the claim is referring to a specific house.
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The defendant <b>is never liable</b> to take an oath <b>unless</b> the claimant <b>claims from him an item that is</b> defined <b>by size, by weight, or by number, and</b> the defendant <b>admits to him with regard to</b> a part of the claim that is <b>an item that is</b> defined <b>by size, by weight, or by number.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava:</b> If the claimant says: <b>I have a <i>kor</i> of produce in your possession, and the other one says: Nothing of yours is in my possession,</b> the defendant is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath, as he denies the entire debt. If he says: <b>I have a large candelabrum in your possession,</b> and the defendant responds: <b>You have only a small candelabrum in my possession,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath, as he admits not to part of the claim, but to possessing a different item. Similarly, if the claimant says: <b>I have a large belt in your possession,</b> and the defendant responds: <b>You have only a small belt in my possession,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from taking an oath.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> if the claimant <b>said to him: I have a <i>kor</i> of produce in your possession, and the other one says: You have only a half-<i>kor</i> in my possession,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath. Similarly, if the claimant says: <b>I have a candelabrum</b> weighing <b>ten <i>litra</i> in your possession,</b> and the defendant responds: <b>You have only a five-<i>litra</i></b> candelabrum <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath.
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: The <b>principle of the matter</b> is that the defendant <b>is never liable</b> to take an oath <b>unless</b> the claimant <b>claims from him an item that is</b> defined <b>by size, or by weight, or by number, and</b> the defendant <b>admits to him with regard to</b> a part of the claim that is <b>an item that is</b> defined <b>by size, by weight, or by number.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> <b>add</b> that was not already taught, by mentioning the <b>principle of the matter? Doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> mention this principle <b>to add</b> that even if the claim is for <b>this</b> specific <b>house full</b> of produce, the defendant is exempt, as this is not considered an item defined by size? Accordingly, the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rava.
Having cited the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara now analyzes it: <b>What is different</b> about a case where the claimant claimed <b>a large candelabrum and</b> the defendant admitted to owing <b>a small candelabrum</b> that renders the defendant exempt from taking an oath? It is because <b>that which he claimed from him, he did not admit to</b> at all, <b>and that which he admitted to, he had not claimed from him. If so,</b> in a case where the claimant claimed <b>a ten</b>-<i>litra</i> candelabrum <b>and</b> the defendant admitted to owing <b>a five</b>-<i>litra</i> candelabrum, the defendant should <b>also</b> be exempt, <b>as that which he claimed from him,</b> a heavier candelabrum, <b>he did not admit to</b> at all, <b>and that which he admitted to,</b> a lighter candelabrum, <b>he had not claimed from him.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said: Here</b> in the latter case <b>we are dealing with a candelabrum</b> composed <b>of segments</b> that detach; the defendant is liable to take an oath <b>because he admits to</b> owing <b>him</b> part <b>of</b> the candelabrum claimed by the claimant.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> the case in which the defendant is liable to take an oath involving <b>a belt as well, and interpret</b> the case as referring <b>to</b> a belt made <b>of</b> pieces that are <b>connected</b> to each other; the claimant claims a belt with a larger number of pieces, and the defendant claims that he owes him a belt with fewer pieces. <b>Rather,</b> clearly the <i>baraita</i> <b>is not teaching</b> cases involving items made <b>of</b> pieces <b>connected</b> to each other. <b>Here too,</b> in the case of the candelabrum, the <i>baraita</i> <b>is not teaching</b> a case of a candelabrum composed <b>of segments</b> that detach.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Abba bar Memel said</b> that the case of <b>a candelabrum is different because</b> one <b>can scrape</b> a <i>ten-litra</i> candelabrum <b>and reduce it to a five-litra</b> one. Therefore, he admitted to a part of the claim.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There is a case of <b>one who lends</b> money <b>to another on</b> the basis of <b>collateral, and the collateral was lost</b> while in the possession of the creditor, <b>and</b> the creditor <b>says to</b> the debtor: <b>I lent you a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral <b>and</b> that collateral <b>was worth a shekel,</b> i.e., a half-sela. Therefore, you owe me a shekel. <b>And the other</b> individual, the debtor, <b>says</b> in response to that claim: <b>That is not</b> the case. <b>Rather, you lent me a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral, <b>and</b> the collateral <b>was worth a <i>sela</i>;</b> I owe you nothing. In this case, the debtor is <b>exempt</b> from payment.
There is a case of a creditor who claims: <b>I lent you a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral <b>and it was worth a shekel. And the other</b> individual, the debtor, <b>says: That is not</b> the case; <b>rather, you lent me a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral, <b>and</b> the collateral <b>was worth three dinars,</b> i.e., three-quarters of a <i>sela</i>. In this case, the debtor is <b>liable</b> to take an oath, due to the fact that he responded to the claim of the creditor with a partial admission.
If in that case the debtor said: <b>You lent me a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral <b>and</b> the collateral <b>was worth two</b> <i>sela</i>, so now you owe me a <i>sela</i>. <b>And the other</b> party, i.e., the creditor, <b>said: That is not</b> the case; <b>rather, I lent you a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral <b>and</b> the collateral <b>was worth a <i>sela</i>.</b> Here, the creditor is <b>exempt.</b> If in that case the debtor said: <b>You lent me a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral <b>and</b> the collateral <b>was worth two</b> <i>sela</i>. <b>And the other</b> party, i.e., the creditor, <b>said: That is not</b> the case; <b>rather, I lent you a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral <b>and</b> the collateral <b>was worth five dinars.</b> Here, the creditor is <b>liable</b> to take an oath due to the fact that he responded to the claim of the debtor with a partial admission.
<b>And who takes</b> the <b>oath? The one</b> in <b>whose</b> possession <b>the deposit had been</b> located, i.e., the creditor, who took collateral from the debtor. The Sages instituted this provision <b>lest this</b> party, i.e., the debtor, <b>take an oath and the other</b> party, i.e., the creditor, <b>produce the deposit</b> and prove the oath false.

Daf 43b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>To which</b> case is the final statement in the mishna, which says the creditor is the one who takes the oath, referring? <b>If we say</b> it is referring <b>to</b> the case in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna, where the debtor claims that the collateral was worth more than the loan, <b>derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> from the fact <b>that</b> the <b>oath is</b> anyway taken <b>by the creditor,</b> as he is the defendant in this case. The additional statement is superfluous.
In response, <b>Shmuel says:</b> This statement relates <b>to</b> the case in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, where the debtor is the defendant. <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Rav similarly says</b> that it relates <b>to the first clause. And Rabbi Yoḥanan similarly says</b> that it relates <b>to the first clause.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> did the <i>amora’im</i> mean by: <b>The first clause?</b> The Gemara answers: They were not referring to the very first <i>halakha</i> in the mishna, but rather to <b>the latter part of the first clause:</b> There is a case of a creditor who claims: <b>I lent you a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral <b>and it was worth a shekel. And the other</b> individual, the debtor, <b>says: That is not</b> the case; <b>rather, you lent me a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral <b>and</b> the collateral <b>was worth three dinars,</b> i.e., three-quarters of a <i>sela</i>. In this case, he is <b>liable</b> to take an oath. <b>As</b> in this case, <b>the oath</b> should in principle be taken <b>by the debtor,</b> since he is the one who admitted to a part of the creditor’s claim, <b>but the Sages removed</b> the obligation to take an oath <b>from the debtor and imposed it on the creditor,</b> deeming him liable to take an oath that the collateral was not worth more than a shekel.
The Gemara notes: <b>And now that Rav Ashi says that we maintain</b> that two oaths are taken in this case, as <b>this</b> party, the creditor, <b>takes an oath that</b> the collateral <b>is not in his possession, and that</b> party, the debtor, <b>takes an oath</b> concerning <b>how much</b> the collateral <b>was worth, this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Who takes an oath first? The one in whose</b> possession <b>the deposit</b> had been located, i.e., the creditor, first takes an oath that the collateral is not in his possession, <b>lest this</b> party, the debtor, <b>take an oath and</b> then <b>the other</b> party, the creditor, <b>produce the deposit</b> and prove the oath false.
§ <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>one who lent one thousand dinars to another and took from him the handle of a sickle as collateral,</b> if <b>the handle of the sickle is lost,</b> the creditor has <b>lost the</b> entire sum of <b>one thousand dinars,</b> even though the lost collateral was worth less. <b>But</b> if he took <b>two handles</b> as collateral and only one of them was lost, the creditor does <b>not</b> lose the entire debt; he loses only the value of the handle that he lost.
<b>And Rav Naḥman says: Even</b> if he took <b>two handles</b> and only <b>one</b> of them was <b>lost,</b> he has <b>lost five hundred</b> dinars, i.e., half the debt. If <b>the other</b> one was then also <b>lost,</b> he has <b>lost the entire</b> debt. <b>But</b> if he took <b>a handle and a piece of silver</b> as collateral and then lost the handle, he has <b>not</b> lost half the debt, as he presumably relied on the silver, not the handle, for payment. The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: Even</b> if he took <b>a handle and a piece of silver,</b> and <b>the piece of silver was lost,</b> he has <b>lost half</b> the debt. If <b>the handle</b> was then <b>lost,</b> he has <b>lost the entire</b> debt.
The Gemara challenges Shmuel’s opinion based on the mishna. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: There is a case of a creditor who claims: <b>I lent you a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral <b>and it was worth a shekel. And the other</b> individual, the debtor, <b>says: That is not</b> the case; <b>rather, you lent me a <i>sela</i> on</b> the basis of that collateral <b>and</b> the collateral <b>was worth three dinars,</b> i.e., three-quarters of a <i>sela</i>. In this case, the debtor is <b>liable</b> to take an oath. According to Shmuel’s opinion that if the collateral is lost, the debt is canceled, <b>let</b> the debtor <b>say to him: You have</b> already <b>received</b> repayment of the debt by means of the collateral.
The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> in <b>the mishna is with regard to</b> a case <b>where</b> the creditor <b>stated explicitly</b> that he is taking the collateral only to assure payment of the value of the item, and not as full repayment. Therefore, since there is a dispute with regard to the collateral’s monetary value, the two parties must litigate this matter. <b>Shmuel,</b> by contrast, was referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> the creditor <b>did not state explicitly</b> whether he was taking the collateral to cover only its monetary value or the entire debt. In that case, it is presumed that he took it to cover the entire debt.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that Shmuel’s ruling is <b>the subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is stated in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who lends</b> money <b>to another on</b> the basis of <b>collateral, and the collateral was lost, he must take an oath</b> that it was in fact lost <b>and</b> may then <b>take his money;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Akiva says</b> that the debtor <b>can say to</b> the creditor: <b>Didn’t you lend me</b> the money <b>only on</b> the basis of <b>the collateral?</b> Since <b>the collateral was lost, your money is lost</b> as well.
<b>But</b> with regard to <b>one who lends</b> another person <b>one thousand dinars with</b> a promissory <b>note, and</b> in addition to the note, the debtor <b>left collateral in</b> the creditor’s <b>possession, all agree</b> that since <b>the collateral was lost, his money is lost</b> as well. Since he had a promissory note as proof of the loan, the collateral was clearly taken as potential repayment.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> under which Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva disagree? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the collateral was <b>worth the amount of money</b> that he lent to him,

Daf 44a

<b>what is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who holds that although the collateral was lost, the debtor is still liable to pay? <b>Rather, is it not</b> a case <b>where</b> the collateral was <b>not worth the amount of money</b> that he lent him? <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>they disagree with regard to</b> the ruling of <b>Shmuel.</b> Rabbi Akiva holds in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, that if the collateral is lost the entire debt is canceled, and Rabbi Eliezer disagrees with this opinion.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, in</b> a case <b>where</b> the collateral was <b>not worth</b> the value of the loan <b>everyone is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Shmuel. But here</b> the dispute is <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where</b> the collateral was <b>worth the amount of money</b> that he lent him, <b>and they disagree with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak. As Rabbi Yitzḥak says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a creditor acquires collateral</b> given to him and is considered its owner as long as the item is in his possession? <b>As it is stated</b> with regard to a creditor who returns the collateral to the debtor for his personal use: <b>“And it shall be a righteousness for you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13).
Rabbi Yitzḥak infers: <b>If</b> the creditor <b>does not acquire</b> the <b>collateral,</b> then <b>from where is his righteousness?</b> If the collateral is not his, the creditor would not be giving up anything of his own. <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that a creditor acquires</b> the <b>collateral.</b> Rabbi Eliezer disagrees with this opinion, maintaining that the creditor has the halakhic status of an unpaid bailee with respect to the collateral, so that he is exempt from paying restitution if it is stolen or lost. He can therefore collect the entire debt from the debtor. Rabbi Akiva agrees with the opinion of Rabbi Yitzḥak, and holds that since the creditor acquires the collateral, he bears financial responsibility to pay its value in the event of its loss. Therefore, he must deduct the value of the collateral when collecting payment of the debt.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>shall we say</b> that the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> that? <b>Say that Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that a creditor acquires the collateral in a case <b>where he took the collateral from him not at the time of the loan,</b> but afterward, in order to induce him to return the loan, as described in the context of the aforementioned verse. But in a case where the creditor <b>took the collateral from him at the time of the loan, does</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak <b>say</b> that he has acquired it?
<b>Rather,</b> in a case where <b>he took the collateral from him not at the time of the loan, everyone agrees that</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak is accepted, and here,</b> the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Akiva is <b>with regard to</b> a case where <b>he took the collateral from him at the time of the loan.</b>
<b>And they disagree with regard to</b> the halakhic status of <b>one who is safeguarding a lost item</b> that he found but has not yet returned. <b>As it was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who is safeguarding a lost item, Rabba says</b> that his halakhic status is <b>like</b> that of <b>an unpaid bailee,</b> who is exempt from paying restitution in the event that the item is lost or stolen,

Daf 44b

<b>and Rav Yosef says</b> that it is <b>like</b> that of <b>a paid bailee,</b> as while performing the mitzva of taking care of a lost item he is exempt from performing other mitzvot that involve the outlay of money, and the money that he saves is tantamount to payment received. Similarly, since safeguarding collateral is part of the mitzva to lend money to the needy, one who does so is exempt during that time from performing other mitzvot that involve the outlay of money. Therefore, Rabbi Eliezer’s ruling, that even if the collateral was lost the creditor collects the entire debt, is in accordance with the opinion of Rabba, and Rabbi Akiva’s ruling, that the creditor loses the value of the collateral, is in accordance with the opinion of Rav Yosef.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>shall we say</b> that the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, with regard to one who is safeguarding a lost item, everyone accepts</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef. And here they disagree with regard to</b> a case where <b>the creditor needs the collateral</b> and uses it with the permission of the debtor, deducting a usage fee from the debt. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Akiva, <b>holds</b> that <b>he is</b> still <b>performing a mitzva</b> by safeguarding it, and is therefore exempt from performing other mitzvot during that time. Consequently, he has the status of a paid bailee. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that since he derives benefit from the collateral, he is safeguarding it for his own benefit, and <b>is not performing a mitzva.</b> Therefore, he has the status of an unpaid bailee.
§ The Gemara resumes discussion of Shmuel’s statement that if the creditor loses the collateral, the debt is canceled. <b>Let us say</b> that Shmuel’s ruling is <b>the subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is stated in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate debts for which collateral was taken: If <b>one lends</b> money <b>to another on</b> the basis of <b>collateral and the Sabbatical Year commences,</b> then <b>even if</b> the collateral <b>is worth only half</b> the value of the loan, the Sabbatical Year <b>does not abrogate</b> the debt; this is <b>the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: If</b> the value of the <b>collateral was commensurate with his debt,</b> the Sabbatical Year <b>does not abrogate</b> the debt, <b>but if</b> it was <b>not</b> commensurate with the debt, the Sabbatical Year <b>abrogates</b> the debt.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the statement: The Sabbatical Year <b>does not abrogate</b> the debt, <b>which the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>says? If we say</b> it means that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate that part of the debt that is <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral, but it does abrogate the rest, this indicates <b>by inference that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds</b> that the Sabbatical Year <b>abrogates</b> the entire debt, including the part <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral <b>as well. But</b> if this is so, <b>why did</b> the creditor <b>seize collateral</b> from the debtor at all?
<b>Rather, is it not</b> that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate the debt at all, and the debtor is liable to pay an amount <b>commensurate with</b> the <b>entire</b> debt? <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>they disagree with regard to Shmuel’s</b> principle that collateral is considered equivalent to the entire debt, even if it is worth less than the debt.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, actually,</b> the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate the debt is referring only to the part of the debt <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral, <b>and they disagree with regard to that</b> part of the debt. <b>The first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds</b> that the Sabbatical Year does not abrogate the part of the debt <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral, <b>and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds</b> that it <b>abrogates</b> the part of the debt <b>commensurate with</b> the collateral <b>as well. And as for</b> the question <b>you said: For what</b> purpose <b>did he seize collateral from him</b> at all, the answer is that he takes it <b>merely as a reminder,</b> to increase the likelihood that the debt will be paid.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>All</b> those <b>who take an oath that</b> is legislated <b>by the Torah take an oath and do not pay.</b> By Torah law, one takes an oath only in order to exempt himself from a monetary claim. <b>And these</b> litigants <b>take</b> a rabbinically instituted <b>oath and receive</b> possession of the disputed funds or property, i.e., their claim is upheld by means of the oath, even though they are not in possession of the property in question: <b>A hired worker</b> who claims that he has not received his wages; <b>and one who was robbed</b> and sues the person who robbed him; <b>and one who was injured,</b> who claims compensation from the person who injured him; <b>and one whose opposing</b> litigant is <b>suspect with regard to the</b> taking of an <b>oath.</b> When a person suspected of taking false oaths is liable to take an oath in order to exempt himself, the claimant takes an oath instead and receives payment. <b>And a storekeeper</b> relying <b>on his ledger</b> also takes an oath and is paid.
<b>How</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply to <b>the hired worker?</b> The case is where one <b>says to</b> his employer: <b>Give me my wages that are</b> still <b>in your possession.</b> The employer <b>says: I</b> already <b>gave</b> them to you. <b>And that</b> worker <b>says: I have not received</b> them. In such a case, the worker <b>takes an oath</b> that he has not received his wages, <b>and he receives</b> payment from his employer. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This oath cannot be administered <b>unless there is partial admission</b> on the part of the employer. <b>How so?</b> The case is where the worker <b>said to him: Give me my wages, fifty</b> silver <b>dinars, which are</b> still <b>in your possession. And</b> the employer <b>says: You have</b> already <b>received one golden dinar,</b> which is worth twenty-five silver dinars. Since the employer has admitted that he owes part of the sum, the worker takes an oath and is paid the whole sum.
<b>How</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply to <b>one who was robbed?</b> The case is where witnesses <b>testified about</b> the defendant <b>that he entered</b> the claimant’s <b>house to seize collateral from him without</b> the <b>authority</b> to do so. The claimant <b>said: You took items</b> that <b>belong to me. And</b> the defendant <b>said: I did not take</b> them. The claimant <b>takes an oath and receives</b> payment of his claim. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This oath cannot be administered <b>unless there is partial admission</b> on the part of the defendant. <b>How so?</b> The case is where the claimant <b>said to him: You took two items. And he says: I took only one.</b> Since the defendant admits that he took one item from the house, the claimant takes an oath and receives payment of his whole claim.
<b>How</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply to <b>one who was injured?</b> The case is where witnesses <b>testified about</b> the injured person <b>that he entered into the domain of</b> the defendant <b>whole but left injured, and</b> the claimant <b>said to</b> the defendant: <b>You injured me. And</b> the defendant <b>says: I did not injure</b> you. The injured party <b>takes an oath and receives</b> compensation. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> This oath cannot be administered <b>unless there is partial admission. How so?</b> The case is where the claimant <b>said to</b> the defendant: <b>You injured me twice. And the other says: I injured you only once.</b> In such a case, the injured party takes an oath that he was injured twice and receives compensation for both injuries.
<b>How</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply to <b>one whose opposing</b> litigant is <b>suspect with regard to the</b> taking of an <b>oath</b> and therefore is not permitted to take the oath?

Daf 45a

One is considered suspect with regard to oaths if he has been found to have taken a false oath, <b>whether</b> it was <b>an oath of testimony, or whether</b> it was <b>an oath on a deposit, or even an oath</b> taken <b>in vain,</b> which is a less severe prohibition. There are also categories of people who by rabbinic decree are considered suspect with regard to oaths: If <b>one of</b> the litigants <b>was a dice player, or one who lends with interest, or</b> among <b>those who fly pigeons, or</b> among <b>the vendors of</b> produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, then the litigant <b>opposing him takes an oath and receives</b> payment of his claim.
If <b>both</b> litigants <b>were suspect, the oath returned to its place.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei,</b> and will be explained in the Gemara. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> Since neither can take an oath, <b>they divide</b> the disputed amount.
<b>And how</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply to <b>the storekeeper</b> relying <b>on his ledger?</b> This ruling is <b>not</b> referring to the case <b>where</b> a storekeeper <b>says to</b> a customer: <b>It is written in my ledger that you owe me two hundred dinars. Rather,</b> it is referring to a case where a customer <b>says to</b> a storekeeper: <b>Give my son two <i>se’a</i> of wheat,</b> or: <b>Give my laborers a <i>sela</i></b> in small <b>coins.</b> And later the storekeeper <b>says: I gave</b> it to them; <b>but they say: We did not receive</b> it. In such a case, where the father or employer admits that he gave those instructions and it is also recorded in the storekeeper’s ledger, the storekeeper <b>takes an oath</b> that he gave the son the wheat or paid the laborers, <b>and he receives</b> compensation from the father or employer; <b>and</b> the laborers <b>take an oath</b> that they were not paid <b>and receive</b> their wages from the employer.
<b>Ben Nannas said: How</b> is it that both <b>these and those come to</b> take <b>an oath in vain?</b> One of them is certainly lying. <b>Rather,</b> the storekeeper <b>receives</b> his compensation <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath, and</b> the laborers <b>receive</b> their wages <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath.</b>
§ If one <b>said to a storekeeper: Give me produce</b> valued <b>at a dinar, and he gave him</b> the produce. And later the storekeeper <b>said to him: Give me that dinar</b> you owe me, and the customer <b>said to him: I gave it to you, and you put it in</b> your <b>wallet [<i>be’unpali</i>], the customer shall take an oath that he gave him the dinar.</b> If, after he gave the storekeeper the money, the customer <b>said to him: Give me the produce,</b> and the storekeeper <b>said to him: I gave it to you and you transported it to your house, the storekeeper shall take an oath</b> that he has already filled the order, and he is exempt from supplying the produce. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Whoever has the produce in his possession has the advantage,</b> and his claim is accepted without his taking an oath.
Similarly, if one <b>said to a money changer: Give me</b> small <b>coins</b> valued <b>at a dinar, and he gave him</b> the coins, and subsequently the money changer <b>said to him: Give me the dinar,</b> and the customer <b>said to him: I gave it to you, and you put it in your wallet; the customer shall take an oath</b> that he paid. If the customer <b>gave</b> the money changer <b>the dinar,</b> and then <b>said to him: Give me the coins,</b> and the money changer <b>said to him: I gave them to you and you cast them into your purse, the money changer shall take an oath. Rabbi Yehuda says: It is not a money changer’s way to give</b> even <b>an <i>issar</i> until he receives a dinar.</b> Therefore, the fact that the customer received the coins indicates that the money changer already received his payment.
§ These cases of taking an oath are <b>just like</b> other cases where the Sages <b>said</b> that one takes an oath and receives payment. The mishna (see <i>Ketubot</i> 87a) teaches: A woman <b>who vitiates her marriage contract</b> by acknowledging receipt of partial payment <b>may collect</b> the remainder <b>only by</b> taking <b>an oath; or</b> if <b>one witness testifies that</b> her marriage contract <b>has been paid, she may collect</b> it <b>only by</b> taking <b>an oath. She may collect</b> it <b>from liened property</b> that has been sold to a third party, <b>or from the property of orphans, only by</b> taking <b>an oath, and</b> a woman <b>who collects</b> it from her husband’s property <b>when not in his presence may collect</b> it <b>only by</b> taking <b>an oath. And likewise, orphans may collect</b> a loan <b>with</b> a promissory note inherited from their father <b>only by</b> taking <b>an oath.</b>
Orphans who wish to collect payment of money owed to their father must take the following oath: On our <b>oath our father did not direct us</b> on his deathbed not to collect with this promissory note, <b>and our father did not say to us</b> that this note was paid, and <b>we did not find among our father’s documents</b> a record showing <b>that this</b> promissory <b>note was paid.</b> After taking that oath, they may collect the money. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says: Even</b> if <b>the son was born after the father’s death, he</b> needs to <b>take an oath</b> in order to <b>receive</b> the money owed to his father. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: If there are witnesses that the father said at the time of his death: This</b> promissory <b>note has not been paid,</b> the son <b>collects</b> the debt <b>without</b> having to take <b>an oath.</b>
§ <b>And these</b> people are sometimes required to <b>take an oath</b> that they do not owe anything even <b>when</b> there is <b>no</b> explicit <b>claim</b> against them: <b>Partners, sharecroppers, stewards [<i>apotropin</i>], a woman who does business from home,</b> where she manages the property of orphans, <b>and the member of the household</b> appointed to manage the household’s affairs. For example, in a case where one of these people <b>said to</b> one of the people whose property he or she manages: <b>What is your claim against me?</b> If the other replied: <b>It is</b> simply <b>my wish that you take an oath to me</b> that you have not taken anything of mine, the former is <b>liable</b> to take that oath.
Once <b>the partners or the sharecroppers have divided</b> the common property, each taking his share, then one side <b>may not require an oath of</b> the other absent a definite claim. But if <b>an oath was imposed upon him due to some other situation, that oath can be extended</b> to impose <b>upon him any</b> other oath, i.e., it can be extended to apply to any other of their disputes. The mishna adds: <b>And the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>abrogates the</b> obligation to take <b>an oath</b> about a debt, just like it abrogates a debt.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: <b>All</b> those <b>who take an oath that</b> is legislated <b>by the Torah take an oath and do not pay.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive that oaths mandated by Torah law serve only to exempt one from payment? We derive it from the fact <b>that the verse states:</b> “The oath of the Lord shall be between them both, to see whether he has not put his hand on his neighbor’s goods; <b>and its owner shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution”</b> (Exodus 22:10). According to the verse, with regard to <b>he who would</b> otherwise <b>need to pay,</b> it is <b>on him</b> that the obligation to take the <b>oath</b> is imposed.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And these</b> litigants <b>take an oath and receive</b> possession of the disputed funds or property, and it lists a hired worker in that category. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>a hired worker that the Sages instituted for him that he take an oath and receive</b> his wages? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Great <i>halakhot</i> were taught here.</b> The Gemara asks: <b><i>Halakhot</i>? Are these</b> oaths actually <b><i>halakhot</i></b> transmitted to Moses from Sinai, as is usually indicated by the use of the term <i>halakhot</i>? They are instituted by rabbinic law. <b>Rather, say: Great ordinances were taught here.</b>
The Gemara asks: Since these ordinances are called <b>great,</b> can one conclude <b>by inference that there are</b> also <b>minor</b> ordinances? Are there rabbinic ordinances that are less important?
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Permanent ordinances were taught here; the Sages uprooted the oath from the employer and imposed it upon the hired worker due to</b> the fact that his wages are <b>his livelihood.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Due to</b> the need to protect <b>the hired worker’s livelihood, do we penalize the employer</b> by leaving him vulnerable to a dishonest worker? The Gemara answers: <b>The employer himself is amenable to the hired worker taking an oath and collecting</b> his wages, <b>so that laborers will accept employment from him.</b> If the workers are not protected in this manner, they will be wary of accepting work.
The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary, isn’t</b> it <b>preferable for the hired worker that</b> in the case of a dispute between them <b>the employer takes the oath and is released</b> from payment? He would agree to this arrangement <b>in order</b> to create conditions in <b>which the employer will</b> readily <b>hire him.</b> If employers are exposed to the risk of being cheated by dishonest workers, they will be wary of hiring. The Gemara answers: <b>The employer perforce hires</b> workers, since he needs the work done. The Gemara asks: Doesn’t <b>the hired worker also perforce accept employment,</b> since he needs it for his livelihood? <b>Rather,</b> the reason the worker takes the oath is that <b>the employer is distracted with</b> managing <b>his laborers,</b> so it is reasonable to assume that he forgot to pay.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> if it is presumed that the employer forgot to pay, <b>let him give</b> the wages to the worker <b>without</b> the worker taking <b>an oath.</b>
The Gemara explains: The oath was instituted <b>to alleviate the concerns of the employer,</b> to ensure him that he is not being cheated. <b>And</b> why did the Sages not institute that the employer <b>should give</b> the worker his wages <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses</b> so that it could readily be established whether he was paid? The Gemara answers: Finding witnesses whenever he pays wages would be <b>a burdensome matter for him. And</b> why did the Sages not institute that the employer <b>should give him</b> his wages <b>at the outset,</b> when he hires him, so there would be no need for an oath? The Gemara answers: <b>They both want</b> the work to be done <b>on credit,</b> i.e., before the wages are paid, as sometimes the employer has no money ready when he hires a worker, and the worker also prefers receiving his money at the end of the day.

Daf 45b

<b>If so,</b> then <b>even</b> with regard to the amount <b>fixed</b> as payment, the employer is apt to be forgetful. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the <b>craftsman says: You fixed two</b> coins <b>as my</b> payment <b>and the other,</b> the employer, <b>says: I fixed only one</b> coin <b>as your</b> payment, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant?</b> The craftsman must bring witnesses to collect the additional sum; an oath is not sufficient. Why is it not assumed that the employer is distracted, and the craftsman would be allowed to take an oath and collect the amount he claims? The Gemara answers: With regard to the <b>fixing</b> of wages, <b>he certainly remembers.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even</b> if <b>the time</b> the wages were due <b>had passed,</b> the worker should be able to prove that he has not been paid by taking an oath. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>is</b> it <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if <b>the</b> established <b>time</b> for paying wages <b>had passed,</b> i.e., the night after the work was performed, <b>and</b> the employer <b>had not given</b> the worker his wages, <b>he no</b> longer can <b>take an oath and receive</b> his wages, but rather must bring witnesses to prove that he was not yet paid.
The Gemara answers: There is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>the employer will not violate the prohibition against delaying</b> payment of wages (see Leviticus 19:13) and will have paid the worker by the deadline. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t you say</b> that the <b>employer is distracted with his laborers</b> and is apt to forget to pay? The Gemara responds: <b>This statement,</b> that he is presumed to be distracted, applies only <b>before the time arrives</b> that <b>he</b> incurs <b>liability</b> for delaying payment of wages. <b>When the time</b> that he incurs <b>liability arrives, he takes it upon himself</b> to <b>remember</b> to pay.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is the hired</b> worker suspected of demanding his wages twice and <b>violating</b> the prohibition <b>against robbery</b> (see Leviticus 19:13)? The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to the employer there are two presumptions</b> supporting his claim that the wages were paid: <b>One</b> is <b>that the employer will not violate the prohibition of delaying</b> payment of wages, <b>and one</b> is <b>that a hired worker will not defer</b> requesting <b>his wages.</b> Therefore, if he is requesting his wages after the deadline, he probably already received them, and he no longer can prove his claim with only an oath.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that a worker takes an oath and receives his wages <b>only when</b> the employer <b>hired him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses. But</b> if <b>he hired him not in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> then <b>since he could have</b> made a more advantageous claim [<i>miggo</i>] and <b>said to him: I never hired you, he can</b> instead <b>say to him: I hired you but</b> already <b>gave you your wages,</b> and that claim is accepted by the court. There is a principle in <i>halakha</i> that one is deemed credible when he makes a less advantageous claim than he could have made. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>That is correct; and so said Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>
The Gemara asks: Can one infer <b>from the fact</b> that Rabbi Yitzḥak said that it was specifically Rabbi Yoḥanan who says this, <b>that Reish Lakish,</b> who often engaged in disputes with Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>disagrees with him,</b> even though Rabbi Yitzḥak did not report that he does? <b>Some say</b> that Reish Lakish <b>was drinking</b> at the time that Rabbi Yoḥanan made his statement <b>and</b> therefore <b>was silent, and some say</b> that <b>he was waiting for him</b> to complete his statement <b>and</b> therefore <b>was silent.</b> It remains unclear whether he disagreed.
<b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rav Menashya bar Zevid says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that a worker takes an oath and receives his wages <b>only when</b> the employer <b>hired him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses. But</b> if <b>he hired him not in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses, since he could have said to him: I never hired you, he can</b> instead <b>say to him: I hired you but</b> already <b>gave you your wages,</b> and that claim is accepted by the court.
§ <b>Rami bar Ḥama said: How excellent is this <i>halakha</i>. Rava said to him: What</b> is its <b>excellence? If</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>so, how can you</b> ever <b>find</b> an instance of the <b>oath of the bailees</b> concerning a deposit <b>that the Merciful One imposed? Since</b> the bailee <b>could say to</b> the owner: <b>These events never occurred,</b> i.e., I never accepted a deposit from you, <b>he can say to him:</b> The deposit was lost <b>by accident.</b> He will not need to take an oath to support his claim, since he would have been deemed credible without taking an oath if he had denied accepting the deposit at all.
Rami Bar Ḥama answered: The oath of the bailees is still relevant <b>where</b> the owner <b>deposited</b> the item <b>with him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses.</b> Rava retorts: Even then, <b>since</b> he <b>could say to him: I</b> already <b>returned it to you,</b> and his claim would be accepted without his taking an oath, <b>he can say to him:</b> The deposit was lost <b>by accident,</b> and his claim will be accepted without his taking an oath.
Rami bar Ḥama answered: The oath of the bailees is still relevant <b>where</b> the owner <b>deposited</b> the item <b>with him, with a document</b> given as a receipt. Possession of the receipt serves as evidence that the bailee has not returned the deposit.
The Gemara comments: <b>By inference</b> from their statements, one may conclude <b>that both</b> Rava and Rami bar Ḥama <b>hold</b> that if <b>one deposits</b> an item <b>with another</b> person <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> he <b>does not need to return</b> it <b>to him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> and his claim that he returned it without witnesses is accepted. But if one deposits an item with another person <b>with a document</b> given as a receipt, <b>he needs to return</b> it <b>to him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> who can testify that it was returned.
§ <b>Rami bar Ḥama would cite</b> this verse <b>about Rav Sheshet: “And David laid up these words in his heart”</b> (I Samuel 21:13), as Rav Sheshet took it upon himself to find sources that would support or contradict the statements of Rav and Shmuel. <b>As</b> it is recounted that <b>Rav Sheshet encountered Rabba bar Shmuel</b> and <b>said to him: Does the Master teach any</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>about a hired worker?</b> Rabba bar Shmuel <b>said to him: Yes, I teach</b> this <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:1): <b>A hired worker within his time</b> for receiving wages <b>takes an oath and receives</b> payment. <b>How so?</b> This applies in a case <b>when</b> the worker <b>said to</b> the employer: <b>You hired me but did not give me my wages, and the other,</b> the employer, <b>says: I hired you and gave you your wages. But</b> if the hired worker <b>said to him: You fixed two</b> coins <b>as my</b> payment, <b>and the other,</b> the employer, <b>says: I fixed only one</b> coin <b>as your</b> payment, <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> who must provide witnesses to testify that the wage was the greater sum.
Rav Sheshet suggested: <b>Since the latter clause</b> addresses a case <b>in</b> which <b>proof,</b> witness testimony, <b>is</b> required, <b>the first clause</b> must address a case <b>in</b> which <b>proof</b> is <b>not</b> required. This contradicts the statements of Rav and Shmuel above that the worker may take an oath and receive payment only when he has witnesses that this person hired him.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b>

Daf 46a

Both <b>the first clause and the latter clause</b> address cases <b>in</b> which <b>proof</b> is required, as even in the first clause the worker must have witnesses testifying that he was actually hired. The <i>baraita</i> does not mention it because it <b>teaches</b> only with regard to <b>proof that</b> requires the employer <b>to pay,</b> but it <b>does not teach</b> with regard to <b>proof that</b> makes it possible for the worker to take <b>an oath</b> and receive payment.
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba said:</b> After Rav’s death the Sages <b>sent</b> the following message <b>to Shmuel from the study hall of Rav: Our teacher, instruct us</b> with regard to the case where the <b>craftsman says: You fixed two</b> coins <b>as my</b> payment; <b>and the other,</b> the employer, <b>says: I fixed only one</b> coin <b>as your</b> payment. <b>Who takes an oath?</b> Shmuel <b>told them: In that</b> case, <b>the employer shall take an oath</b> to support his claim <b>and the craftsman shall lose</b> the difference. With regard to the <b>fixing</b> of wages, <b>people certainly remember.</b> The Sages instituted the oath taken by the worker where he claims he has not been paid in a situation where it is reasonable to presume that the employer is distracted and apt to forget.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rabba bar Shmuel teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there is a dispute with regard to the sum <b>fixed</b> as wages, <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> i.e., the craftsman, <b>and if he does not bring proof,</b> his claim <b>is dismissed.</b> The Gemara clarifies the difficulty: <b>Why? Have the employer take an oath, and</b> only then <b>shall the craftsman lose</b> the difference, in accordance with Shmuel’s ruling. <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> Shmuel <b>teaches</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>disjunctively: Either</b> the craftsman <b>brings proof and receives</b> the amount he claims, <b>or the employer takes an oath, and the craftsman loses</b> the difference.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Shmuel’s ruling from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who gives his cloak to a craftsman</b> for mending, and then the <b>craftsman says: You fixed two</b> dinars as <b>my</b> payment, <b>and that one,</b> the owner, <b>says: I fixed</b> only <b>one</b> dinar as <b>your</b> payment, then <b>so long as</b> it is so <b>that</b> the <b>cloak is in</b> the <b>possession of</b> the <b>craftsman,</b> it is incumbent <b>upon</b> the <b>owner to bring proof</b> that the fee was one dinar. If the craftsman <b>gave</b> the cloak back <b>to him,</b> then there are two scenarios: If the claim is lodged <b>in its</b> proper <b>time,</b> i.e., on the day of the cloak’s return, then the craftsman <b>takes an oath and receives</b> the two dinars. <b>But</b> if <b>its</b> proper <b>time passed,</b> then <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> and the craftsman would need to bring proof that the fee was two dinars.
The Gemara states the objection: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> states that if the claim is lodged <b>in its</b> proper <b>time,</b> the craftsman <b>takes an oath and receives</b> his payment. According to Shmuel’s ruling <b>why</b> should this be so? <b>The employer should take an oath, and the craftsman should lose</b> the difference.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> in response: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says: Any time that</b> the basic obligation to take <b>an oath is directed at the employer,</b> as in this case, as he admits to part of the claim, the Sages instituted that the obligation to take the oath is transferred, and the <b>hired worker takes an oath and receives</b> his payment. But according to the opinion of the Rabbis, the employer takes an oath and is exempted, as Shmuel ruled.
The Gemara asks: To <b>which</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> is Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak referring? <b>If we say</b> he is referring to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda in the mishna</b> (44b), how can that be? There, <b>he is being stringent,</b> and restricts the cases where the worker takes an oath and receives payment, more so than the Rabbis, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The worker does not take an oath and receive payment without any other proof <b>unless there is partial admission</b> on the part of the employer with regard to payment of the wages.
<b>Rather,</b> he is referring to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda in a <i>baraita</i>; as it is taught: A hired worker, as long as the time</b> allotted <b>for him</b> to receive his wages <b>has not passed, takes an oath and receives</b> payment of his claim, <b>and if not,</b> i.e., the time has passed, <b>he does not take an oath and receive</b> payment. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda said: When</b> does the worker take such an oath? It is in a situation <b>when he said to</b> his employer: <b>Give me my wages</b> of <b>fifty</b> silver <b>dinars, which are</b> still <b>in your possession. And</b> the employer <b>says: You have</b> already <b>received a golden dinar,</b> equal to twenty-five silver dinars, <b>from them. Alternatively,</b> the worker <b>said to him: You fixed two</b> coins as my payment; <b>and the other,</b> the employer, <b>says: I fixed only one</b> coin <b>as your</b> payment.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> if the employer <b>said to him: I never hired you, or he said to him: I hired you but gave you your wages, the burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> i.e., the worker. Rabbi Yehuda rules that it is only when they disagree about the amount of the wages owed to the worker that the worker takes an oath and is paid his claim by his employer.
<b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, objects to this: But is</b> this <i>baraita</i>, which says that the craftsman can take an oath about the sum <b>fixed</b> as the price, the opinion of only <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and not</b> that of <b>the Rabbis? Now, where Rabbi Yehuda is stringent</b> and restricts the opportunities of the worker to take an oath and receive payment in the mishna, <b>the Rabbis are lenient,</b> granting the worker the right to take an oath as proof that he has not been paid, then in a case <b>where Rabbi Yehuda is lenient</b> in the dispute described in the <i>baraita</i> concerning the amount fixed as wages, granting the worker the right to take an oath as proof of his claim, <b>would the Rabbis be stringent</b> with regard to the worker and grant the employer the right to take an oath and be exempt?
The Gemara wonders: <b>Rather, what</b> can be said, that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis? But</b> if so, then with regard to <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>that Rabba bar Shmuel teaches,</b> that in a dispute about the sum <b>fixed</b> for the craftsman’s wages <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant, whose</b> opinion is it? It is <b>not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and not</b> that of <b>the Rabbis.</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda the craftsman takes an oath to prove his claim about the wage, and according to the Rabbis, it is the employer who must take an oath to exempt himself from paying the higher wage.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>they disagree about this: Rabbi Yehuda holds that</b> only <b>in</b> the case of an oath mandated <b>by Torah law</b> did the Sages <b>institute an ordinance for</b> the benefit of <b>the hired worker</b> that he can take an oath to support his claim. When the employer’s claim contains an admission to part of the claim of the worker, the employer is required by Torah law to take an oath to support his claim. <b>But with regard to</b> an oath mandated <b>by rabbinic law,</b> such as where the employer denies owing any money, where according to Shmuel he still must take an oath, the original oath <b>is</b> already <b>an ordinance, and we do not institute an ordinance to</b> adjust an already-instituted <b>ordinance.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>with regard to</b> an oath mandated <b>by rabbinic law, we also institute an ordinance for</b> the benefit of <b>the hired worker; but</b> with regard to a dispute about the amount <b>fixed</b> as wages, they maintain that the employer <b>will remember</b> the amount, and therefore he takes the oath and is exempt, as Shmuel ruled. According to Rabbi Yehuda, the worker takes the oath in that case, as the employer admits to part of the claim, and the Sages transferred the oath to the worker as the means by which he can prove his claim. Rav Sheisha’s objection is therefore not valid. The difference between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis is not that Rabbi Yehuda is more stringent; rather, it relates to the circumstances under which they see fit to have the worker take the oath.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>How</b> does the <i>halakha</i> of the worker taking an oath and receiving payment apply to <b>one who was robbed?</b> The case is where witnesses <b>testified about</b> the defendant <b>that he entered</b> the claimant’s <b>house to seize collateral from him</b> without the authority to do so. The claimant said: You took items that belong to me; and the defendant said: I did not take them. The claimant takes an oath and receives payment of his claim. The Gemara challenges: <b>Perhaps he did not seize</b> anything as <b>collateral from him?</b> The witnesses testify only to the fact that he entered the house for that purpose. <b>Doesn’t Rav Naḥman say:</b> With regard to <b>one who takes an ax in his hand and says: I will go and chop</b> down <b>so-and-so’s palm tree, and</b> the palm tree <b>is found chopped down and tossed</b> on the ground, <b>we do not say that he chopped it</b> down, but rather we search for evidence?
<b>Evidently, a person is prone</b> to <b>bluster without acting</b> on his threat. <b>Here, also,</b> it could be <b>that he was blustering</b> about seizing collateral, <b>but did not act</b> on it. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the case in the mishna is where the witnesses testify that he entered the house <b>and seized collateral from him.</b> The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let us</b> ask the witnesses and <b>see what</b> items <b>he seized as collateral from him,</b> and there will be no need for an oath. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is a case <b>where one claims</b> that the defendant took <b>items that can be carried beneath his garments,</b> and the witnesses could not see what they were.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says,</b> concerning a similar topic: If witnesses <b>saw</b> a person <b>who</b> entered another’s house, <b>concealed items beneath his garments, and left,</b>

Daf 46b

<b>and</b> then that person <b>says: They were purchased</b> and that is why they are <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>not deemed credible. And we said</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to items taken from <b>a homeowner who is not apt to sell his items; but</b> with regard to <b>a homeowner who is apt to sell his items,</b> the one taking the items is <b>deemed credible. And even</b> with regard to a homeowner <b>who is not apt to sell his items, we said</b> that the one carrying the items is not deemed credible <b>only</b> with regard to <b>items that are not typically concealed; but</b> with regard to <b>items that are typically concealed,</b> he is <b>deemed credible.</b>
<b>And even</b> with regard to items <b>that are not typically concealed, we said</b> that he is not deemed credible <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a person who is not</b> generally <b>secretive, but</b> with regard to <b>a person who is</b> generally <b>secretive, that is his manner,</b> i.e., he would be likely to conceal items beneath his clothing, and he is deemed credible. <b>And we said</b> this <b>only</b> when <b>this</b> one, the homeowner, <b>says:</b> The items are <b>borrowed, and that</b> one who took the items, <b>says:</b> They are <b>purchased, but in</b> a case where the homeowner claims that the items are <b>stolen,</b> it <b>is not in his</b> power to have his accusation accepted, as <b>we do not presume a person to</b> be <b>a thief.</b>
Furthermore, <b>we said</b> that the one who claims he purchased the items is not deemed credible <b>only with regard to items that are typically lent or rented,</b> where the homeowner’s claim that they must now be returned is more reasonable; <b>but</b> for <b>items that are not typically lent or rented,</b> the person who took them is <b>deemed credible. As Rav Huna bar Avin sent</b> a ruling to the Sages: With regard to <b>items that are typically lent or rented</b> that someone took <b>and said: They were purchased</b> and that is why they are <b>in my possession, he is not deemed credible.</b> This is <b>like that</b> incident <b>where Rava</b> ruled to <b>expropriate fabric scissors and a book of <i>aggada</i> from orphans</b> whose father had taken them, as they were <b>items that are typically lent or rented.</b>
The oath of one who was robbed can be taken by others as well. <b>Rava says: Even a watchman</b> at the house can <b>take</b> the <b>oath,</b> and <b>even the wife of the watchman</b> can <b>take</b> the <b>oath. Rav Pappa asks:</b> With regard to the employer’s regular <b>hired worker or his</b> regular <b>harvester,</b> who are not appointed to safeguard the employer’s property, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara responds: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi:</b> If one <b>states a claim against another</b> that he left his house <b>with a silver cup</b> and is liable to return it, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Ashi replied: <b>We see if</b> the owner of the house <b>is an affluent person, or</b> if <b>he is a trustworthy person with whom people deposit</b> their valuables, as those are people who would typically have a silver cup. If the homeowner is in these categories <b>he takes an oath and receives</b> payment of his claim; <b>but if</b> he is <b>not,</b> he does <b>not</b> receive the benefit of taking an oath in order to prove his claim.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>How</b> does this <i>halakha</i> apply to <b>one who was injured?</b> If witnesses testified about the injured person that he entered into the domain of the defendant whole, but left injured, the injured party may take an oath and receive compensation. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that he needs to take an oath in order to receive compensation <b>only</b> if he was injured <b>in a place where he is able to injure himself, but</b> if he was injured <b>in a place where he is unable to injure himself, he receives</b> compensation <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>And let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he scraped against a wall</b> and caused the injury himself. The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where,</b> for example, <b>he has a bite on his back or on his elbows,</b> which must have been caused by someone else. The Gemara challenges: <b>And perhaps a different</b> person <b>did</b> it <b>to him,</b> and not the defendant. The Gemara explains: This is a case <b>where</b> there <b>is no other</b> person with him besides the defendant.
§ The mishna teaches: How does this <i>halakha</i> apply to <b>one whose opposing</b> litigant is <b>suspect</b> with regard to the taking of an oath and therefore is not permitted to take the oath? One is suspected if he had been found to have taken a false oath, whether it was an oath of testimony or an oath on a deposit, which are prescribed by Torah law, <b>or even an oath</b> taken <b>in vain.</b> The Gemara asks: For <b>what</b> reason does the mishna emphasize: <b>Even an oath</b> taken <b>in vain?</b>
The Gemara explains: The mishna <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary. It is not necessary</b> to state that one who is suspected of falsifying <b>these</b> oaths is disqualified from taking oaths, <b>as they entail the denial of a monetary</b> claim, i.e., due to the false oath someone incurs financial loss, <b>but</b> it is necessary to state that <b>even that</b> oath, an oath taken in vain, <b>which</b> involves <b>merely the repudiation of one’s verbal</b> commitment, nevertheless grants one the status of a person who is <b>not credible</b> and who is disqualified from taking oaths.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>also teach</b> that falsifying <b>an oath on an utterance,</b> which is also an oath without monetary consequences, disqualifies one from taking oaths. The Gemara responds: <b>When</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> which types of false <b>oaths</b> disqualify a person, it includes only oaths with regard to <b>which when one takes the oath, he is</b> at that time <b>falsely taking the oath. But</b> with regard to <b>an oath on an utterance,</b> such as an oath that he will eat a specific fruit that day, <b>where it can be said that he took the oath with true</b> intention and intended to eat that fruit, but ultimately failed to do so, the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach,</b> as one who does not fulfill such an oath retains his credibility to take oaths, since he did not consciously lie.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: It <b>works out well</b> to make this distinction for one who is liable for an oath on an utterance like: <b>I will eat, or: I will not eat,</b> where it is possible that he was not lying when he took the oath. But with regard to oaths about the past like: <b>I ate, or: I did not eat, what can be said,</b> since he certainly took a false oath? The Gemara answers: <b>Teach</b> the mishna, i.e., understand it to mean: <b>An oath</b> taken <b>in vain</b>

Daf 47a

<b>and any</b> oath <b>that is similar to it,</b> i.e., that is clearly a falsehood, disqualifies one from further oath taking.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>one of</b> the litigants <b>was a dice player,</b> or one who lends with interest, or among those who fly pigeons, or among the vendors of produce that grew during the Sabbatical Year, then the litigant opposing him takes an oath and receives payment of his claim. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>these additional</b> examples of a person who is suspect with regard to oath taking? The Gemara explains: The mishna first <b>teaches</b> examples of people who are <b>disqualified by Torah law, and</b> then <b>teaches</b> examples of those who are <b>disqualified by rabbinic law.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>both</b> litigants <b>were suspect,</b> the oath returned to its place; this is the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Meir says: Since neither can take an oath, they divide the disputed amount. <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: How is it</b> actually <b>taught?</b> What is Rabbi Yosei’s opinion and what is Rabbi Meir’s opinion? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I do not know.</b> Rava asked him: <b>What is the <i>halakha</i>?</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I do not know.</b>
It <b>was stated</b> that <b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: They divide</b> the disputed amount. <b>And similarly, Rav Zevid bar Oshaya teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: They divide</b> the disputed amount. The Gemara records a slightly different version of this tradition: <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Zevid teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: They divide</b> the disputed amount. <b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman ruled</b> in an actual <b>case</b> that the litigants <b>divide</b> the disputed amount.
§ Rabbi Yosei rules in the mishna that in a case where both sides are suspect and cannot take an oath, <b>the oath returned to its place.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>To where did it return?</b> What is meant by the oath returning to its place? <b>Rabbi Ami said</b> that <b>our Sages in Babylonia say:</b> The <b>oath returned to Sinai,</b> where God administered an oath to the Jewish people that they would keep the mitzvot of the Torah, including the prohibition against robbery. The litigant who is robbing the other will be punished by God, not the court. <b>Our Sages in Eretz Yisrael said: The oath returned to</b> the one <b>who</b> was initially <b>liable to</b> take <b>it,</b> i.e., the defendant, and since he is disqualified from taking an oath, he must pay.
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that the term: <b>Our Sages in Babylonia,</b> refers to <b>Rav and Shmuel;</b> and the term: <b>Our Sages in Eretz Yisrael,</b> refers to <b>Rabbi Abba.</b> The fact that the term: <b>Our Sages in Babylonia,</b> refers to <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> is <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna (45a): <b>And likewise, orphans may collect</b> a loan <b>with</b> a promissory note inherited from their father <b>only by</b> taking <b>an oath; and we discussed it</b> (see 48a), asking: <b>From whom</b> do they collect a debt by taking an oath? <b>If we say</b> that they collect this way <b>from the borrower,</b> i.e., those who borrowed from their fathers, that would not make sense. <b>Their father would take</b> payment with the promissory note <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath, and they</b> collect only <b>by means of</b> taking <b>an oath?</b> Don’t orphans have privileged status? <b>Rather, this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: And even orphans do not collect</b> with their father’s promissory note <b>from</b> the borrower’s <b>orphans, except by means of</b> taking <b>an oath.</b>
Rav Pappa continues: <b>And Rav and Shmuel both say</b> that the Sages <b>taught</b> that the lender’s orphans need to take an oath in order to be paid by the borrower’s orphans <b>only when</b> the <b>lender died during the lifetime of</b> the <b>borrower,</b> and the lender’s children had an opportunity to collect directly from the borrower without taking an oath. <b>But</b> if the <b>borrower died during the lifetime of</b> the <b>lender,</b> the <b>lender has already become liable to</b> take <b>an oath to the children of</b> the <b>borrower,</b> since one can collect from orphans only by means of an oath, <b>and a person cannot bequeath an oath,</b> i.e., a debt that requires the taking of an oath in order to be collected, <b>to his children,</b> and no payment is made. The lender’s children cannot take the oath that their father would have taken, that the promissory note has not been paid. The only oath they can take is that their father never told them that it had been paid, and that is insufficient once the father became liable to take an oath. From here it is clear that Rav and Shmuel hold that when no oath can be taken, the oath returns to Sinai, and the court takes no action.
The fact that the term: <b>Our Sages in Eretz Yisrael,</b> refers to <b>Rabbi Abba</b> is as the following story illustrates. <b>As</b> there was <b>a certain man who snatched a piece of cast metal from another.</b> The one from whom it was taken <b>came before Rav Ami</b> while <b>Rabbi Abba was sitting before him,</b> and he <b>brought one witness</b> who testified <b>that</b> the other man <b>did,</b> in fact, <b>snatch it from him.</b> The one who snatched it <b>said to him: Yes,</b> it is true that <b>I snatched</b> it, <b>but I</b> merely <b>snatched</b> that which was <b>mine.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ami said: How should judges rule in this case?</b> If they were to <b>say to</b> the one who snatched the metal: <b>Go pay</b> for it, that would not be the correct ruling, because <b>there are not two witnesses</b> who saw him snatch it, and the court does not force payment based on the testimony of one witness. If they were <b>to</b> accept his claim and <b>exempt him</b> entirely, that would not be the correct ruling, because <b>there is one witness</b> who testified against him. If they were to <b>say to him: Go take an oath,</b> which is the usual response to counter the testimony of one witness, <b>once he said</b> that he did in fact <b>snatch</b> it, and there is no proof that it is his, <b>he is like a robber,</b> and the court does not allow a robber to take an oath.
<b>Rabbi Abba said to him: He</b> is one who <b>is liable</b> to take <b>an oath who is unable to take an oath, and anyone who is liable</b> to take <b>an oath who is unable to take an oath</b> is liable to <b>pay.</b> This illustrates that Rabbi Abba holds that the oath returns to its place, i.e., to the defendant, who is disqualified from taking oaths, and that consequently he must pay.
<b>Rava said: It stands to reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Abba; as Rabbi Ami teaches</b> this <i>baraita</i>: The verse states that <b>“the oath of the Lord shall be between them both”</b> (Exodus 22:10), <b>but not between their heirs. What are the circumstances</b> in which one would be liable to take an oath, but his heirs would be exempt?
<b>If we say</b> that it is <b>where</b> the lender’s son <b>said to</b> the borrower’s son: <b>One hundred dinars</b> that belonged <b>to my father</b> were <b>in the possession of your father,</b> as a loan, and you must repay me, and the borrower’s son <b>said to him: He had</b> a debt of <b>fifty, and</b> the other <b>fifty he did not have</b> to pay him, i.e., he did not owe it, that is difficult. Under these circumstances, <b>what</b> does it matter <b>to me</b> if it is <b>he,</b> the borrower’s heir, <b>or his father,</b> the original borrower? Since the son is admitting that he owes part of the money and denying the rest with certainty, he is liable to take an oath, just like his father would have been.
<b>Rather, is it not that</b> the lender’s son <b>said to</b> the borrower’s son: <b>One hundred dinars</b> that were <b>my father’s</b> were left <b>in the possession of your father,</b> and you must repay me, and the borrower’s son <b>said to him:</b> Concerning <b>fifty</b> dinars, <b>I know</b> that my father owed them, <b>but I do not know</b> anything about the other <b>fifty</b> dinars.

Daf 47b

Rabba continues: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>his father,</b> in <b>a case like this, would be liable</b> to take an oath, due to his partial admission, then the <b>verse was necessary to exempt the heirs</b> from taking the oath. <b>But if you say</b> that in <b>a case like this, his father is also exempt</b> from taking an oath, <b>why do I</b> need <b>a verse about</b> exempting the <b>heirs?</b> Evidently, an oath reverts to one who is liable to take it, and when he cannot take that oath he must pay the claim against him.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rav and Shmuel,</b> who hold that one who cannot take an oath does not have to pay, and therefore there is no difference between the heirs and the father, <b>what do they derive from this</b> verse: <b>“The oath of the Lord</b> shall be between them both” (Exodus 22:10)?
The Gemara answers: <b>It is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Shimon ben Tarfon says:</b> The verse: <b>“The oath of the Lord shall be between them both,” teaches that</b> when one litigant imposes an oath on the other, and he takes a false oath, <b>the oath applies to them both,</b> i.e., they are both held responsible for the desecration of God’s name.
Since this Sage was mentioned, the Gemara cites some of his other statements. <b>Shimon ben Tarfon says:</b> With regard to the <b>prohibition of following after an adulterer,</b> i.e., providing him with assistance in carrying out adultery, <b>from where</b> is it derived? <b>The verse states: “You shall not commit adultery [<i>lo tinaf</i> ]”</b> (Exodus 20:13). If the verse is vocalized slightly differently, it may be read: <b>You shall not cause adultery [<i>lo tanif</i> ].</b>
Commenting on the verse describing the response of the Jewish people to the spies’ slander of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“And you murmured [<i>vatteragenu</i>] in your tents</b> and said: Because the Lord hated us, He has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us” (Deuteronomy 1:27), <b>Shimon ben Tarfon says:</b> “<i>Teragenu</i>” is interpreted as though it is composed of two Hebrew expressions: <b>You explored [<i>tartem</i>]</b> the land, <b>and: You disparaged [<i>ginnitem</i>]</b> it, <b>in the tent of the Omnipresent.</b>
With regard to the verse: <b>“As far as the great river, the river Euphrates”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:7), <b>Shimon ben Tarfon says:</b> Although it is not the largest river, the Euphrates is called great in accordance with the adage: <b>Draw close to the</b> one <b>anointed with oil and become anointed</b> as well. Because the Euphrates is close to Eretz Yisrael, it is called great. The <b>school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> a similar idea: <b>The servant of a king is like a king.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>the storekeeper</b> relying <b>on his ledger</b> takes an oath and receives payment. If an employer tells a storekeeper to pay his laborers, and the storekeeper claims he paid them, while the laborers claim that they did not receive payment, both the storekeeper and the laborers take oaths and receive payment from the employer. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: Why</b> is there the <b>bother</b> with <b>this oath,</b> that it is imposed upon both of them? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said to him: We learn</b> in the mishna (see 45a) that <b>both of them take an oath and receive</b> payment of their claims <b>from the employer.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Did</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>accept from him</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>or did he not accept it from him? Come</b> and <b>hear as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: The laborers take an oath to the storekeeper</b> that he had not paid them. <b>And if it is so</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi accepted Rabbi Ḥiyya’s ruling, then Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>should have</b> instead said that the laborers take an oath <b>to the employer.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> Do not conclude that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi did not accept Rabbi Ḥiyya’s ruling. Rather, interpret his statement as follows: <b>The laborers take an oath to the employer in the presence of the storekeeper, so that they will feel ashamed</b> to lie <b>with him</b> present, since he knows whether or not he paid them.
§ <b>It was stated</b> about a similar topic that if there were <b>two sets of witnesses who contradict one another,</b> and it is clear that one set must be testifying falsely, <b>Rav Huna says: This</b> set can <b>come by itself and testify</b> about other cases, <b>and that</b> set can <b>come by itself and testify.</b> Neither set of witnesses is disqualified for future testimony, since there is no way of knowing which was lying. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: Why do I</b> need to become involved <b>with lying witnesses?</b> Since each set of witnesses is possibly untrustworthy, both sets are disqualified.
The Gemara cites the circumstances relevant to this dispute. If, after contradicting each other, the two sets of witnesses testified about circumstances involving <b>two</b> distinct <b>lenders, and two</b> distinct <b>borrowers, and</b> therefore <b>two</b> separate promissory <b>notes,</b> each one signed by a different set of witnesses, <b>this</b> sort of scenario <b>is</b> the subject of <b>their dispute.</b> According to Rav Huna both promissory notes are valid, and according to Rav Ḥisda neither is valid. In the case of a single <b>lender, and</b> a single <b>borrower, and two</b> promissory <b>notes,</b> with each signed by a different one of the sets of witnesses, <b>the holder of the</b> promissory <b>note is at a disadvantage</b> and can collect only the lower sum. One of the promissory notes is necessarily not valid, as it is signed by witnesses who testified falsely.
In the case of <b>two lenders, and a single borrower, and two</b> promissory <b>notes, this is</b> the same as <b>the mishna,</b> where two claimants who contradict each other come to collect payment from a single person who must pay them both, as the evidence for both claims has a presumption of validity. In the case of <b>two borrowers, and a single lender, and two</b> promissory <b>notes, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Can each of the borrowers claim that the promissory note supporting the claim against him is not valid, as it could have been signed by the untrustworthy set of witnesses; or does each of them have to pay unless he can prove that the promissory note against him was signed by the unfit set of witnesses? The Gemara states: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 48a

If <b>one</b> witness who came to testify about the new moon <b>says</b> that he saw it <b>two oxgoads high</b> above the horizon, <b>and</b> the other <b>one says</b> it was <b>three</b> oxgoads high, <b>their testimony is valid,</b> as a discrepancy of this type is reasonable. But if <b>one says</b> that he saw the moon <b>three</b> oxgoads above the horizon, <b>and the</b> other <b>one says</b> it was <b>five, their testimony is voided. But</b> despite this, they are not disqualified as witnesses, and either of them may <b>join in another testimony.</b>
<b>What, is it not</b> teaching that they each can join with another witness <b>for testimony</b> about <b>monetary matters,</b> even though each of them is suspected of giving false testimony? This contradicts Rav Ḥisda’s opinion. <b>Rava said,</b> explaining how Rav Ḥisda understands this <i>baraita</i>: <b>He,</b> one of the contradictory witnesses, <b>and another</b> witness <b>may combine for another testimony about</b> the <b>new moon, as</b> in doing so, <b>they become two</b> witnesses against <b>one</b> testifying differently; <b>and the statement of one</b> witness has <b>no</b> standing <b>in a place</b> where it is contradicted by <b>two</b> witnesses.
§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>said to a storekeeper: Give me produce</b> valued <b>at a dinar,</b> and he gave him the produce, and subsequently the storekeeper and the customer dispute whether the customer ever paid the storekeeper, the mishna rules that the customer takes an oath that he paid. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: When</b> does the customer take this oath? He takes it <b>when the produce is collected and situated</b> in front of them, <b>and the two of them are quarreling about it. But</b> if the customer has it <b>bundled in his basket on his back, the burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> i.e., the storekeeper.
The mishna continues with a similar case: If one <b>said to a money changer: Give me</b> small coins valued at a dinar, and he gave him the coins, and subsequently they dispute whether the customer gave the money changer the dinar, the customer takes an oath that he paid already. The Gemara notes: <b>It is necessary</b> to teach both the case involving the storekeeper and the case involving the money changer, <b>as had it taught us</b> only <b>this first</b> case, one might say that only <b>in that</b> case <b>do the Rabbis say</b> that the customer may take an oath to avoid payment, <b>because produce</b> is <b>prone to spoiling, and since</b> it <b>spoils</b> storekeepers <b>do not retain it</b> but give it to the customer immediately. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>money, which does not spoil, say</b> that <b>they concede to Rabbi Yehuda</b> that a money changer does not give coins to the customer until he has received payment, and the customer does not need to take an oath.
<b>And had</b> the ruling <b>been stated</b> only <b>about that</b> case involving the money changer, one might say that only <b>in that</b> case <b>does Rabbi Yehuda say</b> that the customer need not take an oath to avoid payment, <b>but in this</b> case, involving the storekeeper, <b>say he concedes to the Rabbis.</b> Therefore <b>it is necessary</b> to teach this dispute for both cases.
§ The mishna teaches (see 45a): <b>Just like</b> other cases where the Sages <b>said</b> that one takes an oath and receives payment, the mishna teaches: A woman <b>who vitiates her marriage contract, etc. And likewise, orphans may not collect</b> with a promissory note inherited from their father except by taking an oath. The Gemara asks: <b>From whom</b> do they collect a debt by taking an oath? <b>If we say</b> that they collect this way <b>from the borrower,</b> i.e., those who borrowed from their father, that would not make sense. <b>Their father would take</b> payment with the promissory note <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath, and they</b> collect only <b>by means of</b> taking <b>an oath?</b> Don’t orphans have privileged status? <b>Rather, this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: And even orphans do not collect</b> with their father’s promissory note <b>from</b> the borrower’s <b>orphans except by means of an oath.</b>
<b>Rav and Shmuel both say</b> that the Sages <b>taught</b> that the lender’s orphans need to take an oath in order to be paid by the borrower’s orphans <b>only when</b> the <b>lender died during the lifetime of</b> the <b>borrower,</b> and the lender’s children had an opportunity to collect directly from the borrower without taking an oath. <b>But</b> if the <b>borrower died during the lifetime of</b> the <b>lender,</b> the <b>lender has already become liable</b> to take <b>an oath to the children of</b> the <b>borrower,</b> since one can collect from orphans only by means of an oath, <b>and a person cannot bequeath an oath,</b> i.e., a debt that requires the taking of an oath in order to be collected, <b>to his children,</b> and no payment is made. The lender’s children cannot take the oath that their father would have taken, that the promissory note has not been paid. The only oath they can take is that their father never told them that it had been paid, and that is insufficient once the father became liable to take an oath.
The Sages <b>sent</b> a question <b>to Rabbi Elazar</b> in Eretz Yisrael: <b>What is the nature of this oath</b> to the orphans of the borrower that it has the capacity to prevent the lender’s children from collecting their father’s debt? Rabbi Elazar <b>sent</b> a reply <b>to them:</b> That is not the correct ruling; rather, the <b>heirs take</b> the <b>heirs’ oath,</b> that they have no knowledge that this promissory note was paid, <b>and collect</b> payment of their claim. <b>They sent</b> the same question again to Eretz Yisrael <b>in the days of Rabbi Ami. He said: They continue to send this</b> question to <b>this extent? If we had found</b> a different <b>explanation, wouldn’t we have sent</b> it <b>to them? Nevertheless, Rabbi Ami said: Since</b> this question <b>came to us, let us say something about it.</b>
If the litigants <b>stood trial and</b> then the lender <b>died</b> before taking an oath, the <b>lender has already become liable</b> to take <b>an oath to the children of</b> the <b>borrower</b> in accordance with the court’s ruling, <b>and a person cannot bequeath an oath to his children,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav and Shmuel. If the litigants <b>did not</b> yet <b>stand trial, and</b> the lender <b>died, the</b> lender’s <b>heirs take the heirs’ oath, and collect</b> payment of their claim, as Rabbi Elazar said.
<b>Rav Naḥman objects to this: Is that to say</b> that it is <b>the court that renders</b> the lender <b>liable</b> to take <b>an oath? At the moment</b> the <b>borrower died,</b> the <b>lender was liable</b> to take <b>an oath to the children of</b> the <b>borrower.</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said: If</b> the ruling <b>of Rav and Shmuel is</b> accepted, <b>it is</b> accepted; and <b>if it is not</b> accepted, <b>it is not.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Evidently,</b> Rav Naḥman <b>is uncertain</b> whether the ruling of Rav and Shmuel is accepted. <b>But didn’t Rav Yosef bar Minyumi say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman ruled</b> in an actual <b>case</b> against Rav and Shmuel, ruling that where both litigants are suspect about oaths <b>they divide</b> the disputed amount? The Gemara answers: Rav Naḥman <b>stated</b> his uncertainty with regard to the ruling of Rav and Shmuel, who rule in accordance <b>with the statement of Rabbi Meir</b> that the oath returns to its place, <b>but he himself does not hold accordingly,</b> but rather rules in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yosei, who says that they divide the claim.
<b>Rav Oshaya raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 104a): If a widow <b>died</b> without having received payment of her marriage contract, <b>her heirs,</b> e.g., sons from a previous marriage, <b>may invoke her marriage contract</b> in order to demand payment of it for <b>up to twenty-five years</b> later. Her heirs, who are orphans, can take an oath and collect their claim, even though they are collecting from other orphans, in contradiction to the ruling of Rav and Shmuel. The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a situation <b>where</b> the widow <b>took an oath but died</b> before she could collect the payment. When her heirs come to collect, an oath is no longer required.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 90a): In a case where <b>he married</b> his <b>first</b> wife <b>and she died,</b> and by the terms of the marriage contract, her sons inherit the sum promised in her marriage contract after the husband dies, if <b>he</b> subsequently <b>married</b> his <b>second</b> wife, <b>and</b> then <b>he died,</b> the <b>second</b> wife <b>and her heirs take precedence over the heirs of the first</b> wife, in collecting payment of her marriage contract. The heirs of the second wife can collect the marriage contract by taking an oath to the heirs of the first wife, stating that they have no knowledge of their mother having received her marriage contract, even though this is an oath bequeathed to them by their mother. This mishna therefore contradicts the ruling of Rav and Shmuel. The Gemara answers: This does not contradict their ruling, because they understand it to <b>also</b> be a situation <b>where</b> the second wife <b>took an oath but died</b> before she collected the payment.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 86b): If a husband stipulated that when his wife collects payment of her marriage contract he will not impose an oath on her or on her heirs or representatives, he may not impose an oath, <b>but his heirs can administer an oath to her, to her heirs, and to those who come on her authority</b> as representatives. Her heirs take an oath to collect from the husband’s heirs, though they are all orphans. This is contrary to the ruling of Rav and Shmuel, and here it is clear that the wife did not take an oath before she died.
<b>Rav Shemaya said:</b> The mishna is in accordance with Rav and Shmuel’s ruling because it <b>teaches</b> the administration of an oath <b>disjunctively.</b> The heirs can administer an oath <b>to her when</b> she is receiving payment of her marriage contract as <b>a widow, or</b> they can administer an oath to <b>her heirs when</b> she is <b>a divorcée</b> who died after the divorce and before her husband died. Since she died first, her heirs were not bequeathed an oath to her husband’s heirs.
<b>Rav Natan bar Hoshaya raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: Sometimes <b>the power of the son is greater than the power of the father,</b>

Daf 48b

<b>as the son can collect both by</b> taking <b>an oath and without</b> taking <b>an oath, while the father can collect only by</b> taking <b>an oath. What are the circumstances</b> in which this occurs? It is <b>when</b> the <b>borrower died during the life of</b> the <b>lender.</b> The father who is the lender can collect from the borrower’s heirs only if he takes an oath.
<b>And it is taught: As the son can collect both by</b> taking <b>an oath and without</b> taking <b>an oath.</b> He collects <b>by</b> taking <b>an oath</b> when he takes <b>the heirs’ oath,</b> that he has no knowledge that his father’s debt was paid, and he collects <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> in the mishna, that when there are witnesses that the father said at the time of his death that a certain promissory note had not been paid, the son collects the debt without taking an oath. In any case, absent testimony to that effect, the father bequeaths the oath to his children and the son can collect by taking an oath, contrary to the ruling of Rav and Shmuel.
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> in response: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, who say</b> that a debt recorded in a promissory <b>note that stands to be collected</b> is considered <b>as if</b> it <b>is</b> already <b>collected.</b> Therefore, the father is considered to be already in possession of the loan and bequeaths it to his son. Even though the Sages instituted that the son take an oath to the heirs of the borrower, this is not a case of the son inheriting an oath.
§ It is related that <b>Rav Naḥman arrived in</b> the city of <b>Sura. Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna came to</b> see <b>him. They said to him: Let</b> our <b>Master come,</b> and together <b>we will overturn that</b> ruling <b>of Rav and Shmuel.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to them: Did I exert</b> myself <b>and come all these parasangs to uproot that</b> ruling <b>of Rav and Shmuel? Rather, let us not extend</b> their ruling by applying it to other situations outside the specific context of when the borrower died during the lifetime of the lender. The Gemara offers an example: This is <b>like what Rav Pappa says:</b> If a creditor <b>vitiates his</b> promissory <b>note,</b> by acknowledging that he has received partial payment and thereby rendering himself liable to take an oath in order to receive the rest, <b>and</b> then he <b>dies,</b> his <b>heirs take the heirs’ oath and collect</b> from the debtor.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> debtor <b>who died and left a guarantor</b> of his debt, and the orphans of the creditor came to collect from the guarantor. <b>Rav Pappa thought to say: This, too, is</b> a case to which <b>one should not extend</b> Rav and Shmuel’s ruling, as they said only that orphans do not inherit an oath to collect from other orphans, and this should not apply to collecting from a guarantor. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to Rav Pappa: Is that to say</b> that <b>the guarantor will not pursue</b> the <b>orphans</b> and collect from them? Ultimately, collecting from the guarantor is tantamount to collecting from the orphans, and no distinction should be made.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> creditor <b>who died and left a brother</b> as his heir, who wanted to collect from the orphans of the debtor. <b>Rami bar Ḥama thought to say</b> that <b>this, too, is</b> a case to which <b>one should not extend</b> Rav and Shmuel’s ruling, since Rav and Shmuel ruled that one does not bequeath an oath to one’s children, and they did not mention a case where the heir is a brother. <b>Rava said to him: What</b> difference does it make <b>to me</b> if the oath taken by the heir is: My <b>father did not inform me</b> that this debt has been paid, <b>and what</b> difference does it make <b>to me</b> if the oath taken is: <b>My brother did not inform me?</b>
<b>Rav Ḥama says: Now that the <i>halakha</i> was not stated either in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav and Shmuel or in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, a judge who rules in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav and Shmuel has ruled,</b> and his ruling is accepted, and a judge <b>who rules in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar has ruled,</b> and his ruling is accepted.
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> When <b>that</b> promissory <b>note of orphans</b> comes before our court, <b>we do not tear it up, but we</b> also <b>do not collect</b> the debt <b>with it. We do not collect</b> the debt <b>with it,</b> since <b>perhaps we</b> should <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> that orphans cannot collect debts in a case where their father was required to take an oath to collect, as they cannot take the appropriate oath; <b>but we do not tear it up, since a judge who rules in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar has ruled.</b>
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain judge who ruled in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar. There was a Torah scholar in his city. He said to</b> the judge: <b>I will bring a letter from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, stating <b>that the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b> The judge <b>said to him: When you bring</b> such a letter, I will consider it, but for now I stand by my ruling. That Torah scholar <b>came before Rav Ḥama,</b> and Rav Ḥama <b>said to him: A judge who rules in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar has ruled,</b> and his ruling cannot be voided.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And these</b> people are sometimes required to <b>take an oath</b> that they do not owe anything even when there is no explicit claim against them: Partners, sharecroppers, stewards, a woman who does business from home, where she manages the property of orphans, and the member of the household appointed to manage the household’s affairs. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>we are dealing with fools</b> who take an oath even though no claim has been brought against them? The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: And these</b> people <b>take an oath without</b> it being in response <b>to a definite claim but</b> only <b>to an uncertain claim,</b> i.e., the claimant cannot know with certainty that he is owed money: <b>Partners, sharecroppers,</b> and the others listed in the mishna.
The Sages <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ketubot</i> 9:3): With regard to the <b>member of the household whom they mentioned</b> in the mishna, this is <b>not</b> referring to one <b>who enters and exits</b> the house <b>on foot</b> as a family friend, but <b>rather</b> to one who <b>engages laborers, and dismisses laborers, gathers produce, and sends out produce</b> in managing the household.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about <b>these</b> people listed in the mishna, e.g., partners, such that they are liable to take an oath in response to an uncertain claim? It is <b>because they</b> tend to <b>grant</b> themselves <b>permission</b> to take for themselves <b>from</b> the property for which they are responsible, using as an excuse the effort they invest in their duties.
<b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> One takes an oath in response to an uncertain claim only <b>when there is a claim between them</b> worth at least <b>two silver</b> <i>ma’a</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this ruling? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> that of <b>Shmuel?</b> Shmuel holds that one becomes liable to take an oath after admitting to part of a claim when the value of the entire claim is at least two silver <i>ma’a</i>. Rav holds that the portion one denies he owes must be at least two <i>ma’a</i> (see 39b). <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in support of Rav?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that Rav Naḥman means that <b>the</b> value of the <b>denial of a claim</b> is at least two silver <i>ma’a</i>, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: Once <b>the partners or the sharecroppers have divided</b> the common property, and each has taken his share, then one side may not require an oath of the other absent a definite claim. <b>A question was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>about extending</b> an oath to an additional situation, in a case where the original oath is <b>by rabbinic law?</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one borrowed from</b> another on the <b>eve of,</b> i.e., before, the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and upon the conclusion of the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>became his partner or sharecropper,</b> the lender <b>may not extend</b> the partner’s or sharecropper’s oath to an oath about the loan. The Gemara infers: The <b>reason</b> he may not extend the oath is <b>that he borrowed from him</b> on the <b>eve of the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>so that</b> the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>came and abrogated</b> the loan, rendering the oath irrelevant. <b>Therefore,</b> if he borrowed during <b>the other years of the</b> seven-year <b>Sabbatical</b> cycle, an oath <b>may be extended</b> from the partner’s oath or sharecropper’s oath, which are rabbinic ordinances, to an oath about the loan.
The Gemara rejects that inference: <b>Do not say: Therefore,</b> if he borrowed during <b>the other years of the Sabbatical</b> cycle, an oath <b>may be extended. Rather, say</b> that one should infer from the <i>baraita</i> that if <b>he became his partner or sharecropper</b> on the <b>eve of the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and upon the conclusion of the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>he borrowed from him</b> and incurred an oath by Torah law, that oath <b>may be extended.</b>
The Gemara asks: Isn’t <b>that taught explicitly</b> in a <i>baraita</i>? It teaches: <b>If he became his partner or sharecropper on the eve of the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and upon the conclusion of the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>he borrowed from him,</b> the oath <b>may be extended.</b> Therefore, the initial inference must be correct. <b>Conclude from it</b> that an oath incurred <b>by rabbinic law may be extended.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is so.
<b>Rav Huna says:</b>

Daf 49a

<b>Any</b> oath, including one incurred by rabbinic law, <b>may be extended</b> to render the person who takes it liable to take an additional oath, <b>except for</b> the oath of <b>a hired worker, which may not be extended,</b> since the hired worker’s oath was instituted only to alleviate the concerns of the employer. <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> For <b>everyone,</b> the Sages <b>are not lenient,</b> in that they extend any oath they incur to impose upon them additional oaths, <b>except for a hired worker,</b> for <b>whom they are lenient.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the rulings of Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> as to whether the court <b>initiates</b> extending an oath <b>for him,</b> i.e., even when the other litigant has not suggested it, the court extends the original oath to include an oath about other claims.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>The Sabbatical</b> Year <b>abrogates</b> the obligation to take an oath about a debt, just like it abrogates a debt. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It is derived from the fact <b>that the verse states: “And this is the matter [<i>devar</i>] of the release:</b> Every creditor shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor; he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother, because the Lord’s release has been proclaimed” (Deuteronomy 15:2). Since the word <i>devar</i> also means statement, <b>this teaches that the Sabbatical Year releases,</b> i.e., abrogates, <b>even a statement,</b> i.e., an oath.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There are four</b> types of <b>bailees,</b> to whom different <i>halakhot</i> apply. They are as follows: <b>An unpaid bailee,</b> who receives no compensation for safeguarding the item in his care; <b>and a borrower,</b> who receives an item on loan for his own use without paying a rental fee; <b>a paid bailee,</b> who is paid a salary for safeguarding the deposited item; <b>and a renter,</b> i.e., one who pays a fee for the use of an item or animal.
In the event that one of these bailees is unable to return the deposited item to its owner, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to liability is dependent upon what happened to the item, and upon the type of bailee: <b>An unpaid bailee takes an oath</b> attesting to the fact that he was not negligent with the care of the item and is then exempt from liability <b>for everything,</b> meaning for all types of damage, whether the item was lost, stolen, damaged, or if the animal died. Conversely, <b>a borrower</b> does not have the option of taking an oath, and <b>pays for everything,</b> whether the item was stolen, lost, damaged, or the animal died, even if it was by unavoidable accident.
The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>a paid bailee and a renter</b> are the same: They <b>take an oath concerning an injured</b> animal, <b>and concerning a captured</b> one, <b>and concerning a dead</b> animal, attesting to the fact that these mishaps were not caused by negligence, but rather by unavoidable accident, and then are exempt from liability. <b>But they must pay</b> if the deposit cannot be returned due to <b>loss or theft,</b> even if these were not caused by negligence.
The mishna clarifies: If the owner of an ox <b>said to an unpaid bailee: Where is my ox?</b> And the unpaid bailee <b>said to him: It died, but</b> the truth was <b>that it was injured or captured or stolen or lost;</b> or if the bailee responded: <b>It was injured, but</b> the truth was <b>that it died or was captured or stolen or lost;</b> or if he responded: <b>It was captured, but</b> the truth was <b>that it died or was injured or stolen or lost;</b> or if he responded: <b>It was stolen, but</b> the truth was <b>that it died or was injured or captured or lost;</b> or if he responded: <b>It was lost, but</b> the truth was <b>that it died or was injured or captured or stolen,</b> in any of the above cases, if the owner of the ox then said: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your claim, <b>and</b> the unpaid bailee <b>said: Amen,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a guilt-offering, despite the fact that he took a false oath. The reason is that his false oath did not render him exempt from liability to pay.
If the owner says to an unpaid bailee: <b>Where is my ox?</b> And the unpaid bailee <b>said to him: I do not know what you are talking about, but</b> the truth was <b>that it died or was injured or captured or stolen or lost,</b> and the owner said: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your claim, <b>and</b> the unpaid bailee <b>said: Amen,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a guilt-offering, since he would not have been liable to pay in any of these cases.
But if the owner said to the unpaid bailee: <b>Where is my ox?</b> And the unpaid bailee <b>said to him: It is lost,</b> and the owner said: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your claim, <b>and</b> the unpaid bailee <b>said: Amen, and</b> then <b>witnesses testify that</b> the bailee <b>consumed it,</b> he <b>pays</b> the owner <b>the principal,</b> since he took the ox for himself. But if there were no witnesses, but after he took the oath <b>he admitted of his own</b> accord that he stole the ox and took a false oath, then he <b>pays</b> the owner the <b>principal and</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and</b> he brings <b>a guilt-offering</b> to achieve atonement, as in any other case where one takes a false oath with regard to a deposit.
Similarly, if the owner said to the unpaid bailee: <b>Where is my ox? And</b> the unpaid bailee <b>said to him: It was stolen,</b> and the owner said: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your claim, <b>and</b> the unpaid bailee <b>said: Amen, and</b> then <b>witnesses testify that</b> the bailee <b>stole it,</b> he <b>pays double</b> the principal. <b>If he admitted of his own</b> accord that he stole it, then he is exempt from double payment for theft, but <b>pays</b> the <b>principal and</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and</b> brings <b>a guilt-offering</b> to achieve atonement.
If the owner of an ox <b>said to someone in the marketplace,</b> i.e., a stranger who was not a bailee: <b>Where is my ox that you stole?</b> And the accused <b>says: I did not steal</b> it, <b>and</b> then <b>witnesses testify that</b> the accused <b>did steal it,</b> he <b>pays the double payment.</b> If <b>he slaughtered or sold</b> it, he <b>pays the fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> If the accused <b>saw witnesses that were approaching</b> to testify against him, and at that point <b>he said:</b> I admit that <b>I stole</b> the animal <b>but I did not slaughter or sell</b> it, <b>he pays only</b> the <b>principal.</b>
If the owner <b>said to a borrower: Where is my ox?</b> And the borrower <b>said to him:</b>

Daf 49b

<b>It died, but</b> the truth was that <b>it was injured or captured or stolen or lost;</b> or if he responded: <b>It was injured, but</b> the truth was <b>that it died or was captured or stolen or lost;</b> or if he responded: <b>It was captured, but</b> the truth was <b>that it died or was injured or stolen or lost;</b> or if he responded: <b>It was stolen, but</b> the truth was <b>that it died or was injured or captured or lost;</b> or if he responded: <b>It was lost, but</b> the truth was <b>that it died or was injured or captured or stolen,</b> in any of the above cases, if the owner of the ox said: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your claim, <b>and</b> the borrower <b>said: Amen,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing an offering for his false oath, since the oath did not render him exempt from liability to pay. He would have been liable to pay in any case.
But if the owner said to the borrower: <b>Where is my ox?</b> And the borrower <b>said to him: I do not know what you are talking about, but</b> the truth was <b>that it died or was injured or captured or stolen or lost,</b> and the owner said: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your claim, <b>and</b> the borrower <b>said: Amen,</b> the borrower is <b>liable</b> to bring a guilt-offering, as he took an oath that would render him exempt from liability to pay.
If an owner <b>said to a paid bailee or a renter: Where is my ox?</b> And the latter <b>said to him: It died, but</b> the truth was <b>that it was injured or captured;</b> or if he said: <b>It was injured, but</b> the truth was <b>that it died or was captured; or if he said: It was captured, but</b> the truth was <b>that it died or was injured;</b> or if he said: <b>It was stolen, but</b> the truth was <b>that it was lost;</b> or if he said: <b>It was lost, but</b> the truth was <b>that it was stolen,</b> and the owner said: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your claim, <b>and he said: Amen,</b> the paid bailee or renter is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a guilt-offering.
If the paid bailee or renter said: <b>It died or was injured or captured, but</b> the truth was <b>that it was stolen or lost,</b> and the owner said: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your claim, <b>and he said: Amen,</b> the paid bailee or renter is <b>liable</b> to bring a guilt-offering. If the paid bailee or renter said: <b>It was lost or stolen, but</b> the truth was <b>that it died or was injured or captured,</b> and the owner said: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> concerning your claim, <b>and he said: Amen,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a guilt-offering.
<b>This is the principle: Anyone who changes from</b> one claim of <b>liability to</b> another claim of <b>liability or from</b> one claim of <b>exemption to</b> another claim of <b>exemption or from</b> a claim of <b>exemption to</b> a claim of <b>liability</b> is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a guilt-offering. If he changes <b>from</b> a claim of <b>liability to</b> a claim of <b>exemption,</b> he is <b>liable. This is the principle: Anyone who takes an oath to be lenient with himself</b> is <b>liable;</b> if he takes an oath <b>to be stringent with himself,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that there are <b>four</b> types of <b>bailees? Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: It is Rabbi Meir. Rava said to Rav Naḥman:</b> And <b>is there a <i>tanna</i> who does not accept</b> that there are <b>four</b> types of <b>bailees,</b> as the question and your answer indicate? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: This</b> is what <b>I am saying to you: Who is the <i>tanna</i> who says</b> that <b>a renter has the same</b> halakhic status <b>as a paid bailee?</b> With regard to this question, <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: It is Rabbi Meir.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But we</b> have <b>heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Meir said the opposite, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How does a renter pay? Rabbi Meir says:</b> He pays <b>like an unpaid bailee. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He pays <b>like a paid bailee.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rabba bar Avuh taught</b> this <i>baraita</i> while <b>reversing</b> the opinions, stating that Rabbi Meir is of the opinion that a renter is like a paid bailee; therefore, he said that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir.
The Gemara asks: <b>Are these</b> in fact <b>four</b> types of bailees? <b>There are</b> actually only <b>three,</b> as the <i>halakhot</i> relating to a paid bailee and a renter are identical. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> There are indeed <b>four</b> types of <b>bailees</b> with regard to the manner in which they accepted the deposit, <b>but</b> only <b>three <i>halakhot</i></b> that apply to <b>them.</b>
§ The following cases were stated in the mishna: If the owner of an ox <b>said to an unpaid bailee: Where is my ox;</b> or if the owner of an ox <b>said to someone in the marketplace:</b> Where is my ox that you stole; or if <b>he said to a bailee: Where is my ox,</b> and the other person <b>said to him: I do not know what you are talking about.</b> With regard to all of these situations referred to in the mishna, <b>Rav says: All of them are exempt from</b> bringing a guilt-offering for falsely taking <b>an oath of</b> the <b>bailees, but they are liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for</b> falsely taking <b>an oath on an utterance. And Shmuel says: They are exempt</b> from bringing a sin-offering <b>for</b> falsely taking <b>an oath on an utterance as well.</b>
<b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? Shmuel holds</b> that he is exempt from bringing an offering because <b>there is no</b> possibility of taking that oath <b>with regard to</b> an event that may occur in <b>the future,</b> i.e., that the deposited animal will die or be stolen or be lost, and Shmuel holds that one is not liable for taking an oath on an utterance in the case of any oath that one cannot take with reference to the future. <b>And Rav holds</b> that <b>there is</b> an obligation to bring a sin-offering because it is possible to take both <b>a negative</b> oath <b>and a positive</b> one. One of the conditions necessary in order for one to incur liability for an oath on an utterance is that the oath can be formulated as both a negative and a positive statement. This oath meets that criterion as one can formulate the oath in the negative, e.g., the deposit was not stolen, as well as in the positive, e.g., it was stolen.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But they</b> already <b>disputed this</b> question on <b>another occasion</b> (see 25a), <b>as it was stated:</b> With regard to one who says: On my <b>oath so-and-so threw a stone into the sea, or:</b> On my <b>oath he did not throw</b> it, <b>Rav says:</b> If it was later discovered that his statement was false, he is <b>liable</b> to bring an offering for his oath. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> He is <b>exempt. Rav says</b> that he is <b>liable, as</b> the oath <b>can be positive or negative. And Shmuel says</b> he is <b>exempt because</b> this oath <b>cannot be</b> stated <b>with regard to the future,</b> since he cannot control what so-and-so does.
The Gemara explains: <b>It was necessary</b> to state the dispute in the case of a bailee as well, <b>as if they would teach</b> it <b>to us</b> only <b>in</b> the case where one took an oath that so-and-so threw a stone, it may have been understood that it is only <b>in this</b> case that <b>Rav says</b> that the person taking the oath is exempt, <b>since he is taking</b> a false <b>oath of his own accord, but in</b> the case in the mishna here, <b>where</b> it is <b>the court</b> that <b>is administering</b> the oath <b>to him, say</b> that Rav <b>concedes to Shmuel</b> that he is exempt, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ami. As Rabbi Ami says:</b> In the case of <b>any oath that</b> is <b>administered by the judges, one is not liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for</b> falsely taking <b>an oath on an utterance.</b>
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if</b> the dispute <b>had been stated</b> only <b>in this</b> case, i.e., the case of the bailee to whom the court administers the oath, one might have said: It is <b>in this</b> case that <b>Shmuel says</b> that he is exempt, in accordance with Rabbi Ami’s statement, <b>but in</b> a case where one took an oath that so-and-so threw a stone, <b>say</b> that Shmuel <b>concedes to Rav</b> that he is liable. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for the dispute to be stated in both cases.
Having mentioned Rabbi Ami’s ruling, the Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rabbi Ami says:</b> In the case of <b>any oath that</b> is <b>administered by the judges,</b> one is <b>not</b> liable <b>for</b> falsely taking <b>an oath on an utterance, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“Or if [<i>ki</i>] anyone swears clearly with his lips</b> to do evil or to do good, whatever it is that a man shall utter clearly with an oath, and it is hidden from him…and the priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin” (Leviticus 5:4–6). Only if one takes the oath <b>of his own</b> accord is he liable, as the verse can be understood <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Reish Lakish. As Reish Lakish says:</b> The term <b><i>ki</i> has four</b> distinct <b>meanings: If, perhaps, rather,</b> and <b>as.</b> According to Rabbi Ami, its meaning in the above verse is: If, indicating that only if one takes the oath of his own accord is he liable.
<b>Rabbi Elazar says: All of them,</b> i.e., all those listed in the mishna as exempt, <b>are exempt</b> from bringing a guilt-offering <b>for taking an oath of</b> the <b>bailees, but they are liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for</b> taking <b>an oath on an utterance, except for a borrower</b> who says: <b>I do not know what you are talking about, and a paid bailee or a renter</b> who claims that the deposit was <b>stolen or lost.</b> In these cases, the bailee is <b>liable</b> for taking an oath of the bailees, <b>as he denied a monetary</b> claim, meaning that he wanted to render himself exempt from liability to pay. This <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rav.<br/>This chapter explained that a bailee who makes a false claim and takes an oath to that effect is not always liable for falsely taking an oath of the bailees. The principle with regard to this matter was stated at the end of the mishna: Any bailee who makes a false claim that would in any case not render him exempt from liability to pay, and takes an oath to that effect, is not liable for falsely taking an oath of the bailees.
