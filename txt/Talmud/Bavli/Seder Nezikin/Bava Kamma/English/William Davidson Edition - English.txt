Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>four primary categories of damage: The</b> category of <b>Ox; and the</b> category of <b>Pit; and the</b> category of <b><i>Maveh</i>,</b> which, based on a discussion in the Gemara refers either to the tooth of an animal that causes damage or to a person who causes damage; <b>and the</b> category of <b>Fire.</b>
Each of these categories is unique; therefore, the <i>halakhot</i> of one cannot be derived from another. The defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Ox is not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b><i>Maveh</i>, and</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b><i>Maveh</i> is not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Ox. And</b> the defining characteristics of <b>this</b> category of Ox <b>and that</b> category of <i>Maveh</i>, <b>in which there is a living spirit</b> that causes damage, <b>are not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> category of <b>Fire, in which there is no living spirit.</b>
The mishna continues: <b>And</b> the defining characteristics of <b>this</b> primary category of Ox and <i>Maveh</i> <b>and that</b> primary category of Fire, <b>in which</b> the <b>typical manner</b> of their components is <b>to proceed</b> from one place to another <b>and</b> cause <b>damage, are not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Pit, in which</b> the <b>typical manner</b> of its components is <b>not to proceed</b> from one place to another <b>and</b> cause <b>damage;</b> rather, it remains in place and the damage is caused by the injured party proceeding and encountering the obstacle.
<b>The common denominator of</b> the components in all of <b>these</b> primary categories is <b>that</b> it is <b>their typical manner to cause damage, and</b> the responsibility for <b>their safeguarding</b> to prevent them from causing damage is incumbent <b>upon you,</b> the owner of the animal or generator of the fire or the pit. <b>And when</b> a component of any of these categories <b>causes damage, the</b> owner or generator of the component that <b>caused</b> the <b>damage is obligated to pay</b> restitution <b>for damage with best</b>-quality <b>land.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> its ruling employing the term: <b>Primary categories, by inference, there are subcategories</b> of those primary categories. The Gemara asks: Are <b>their subcategories similar to them,</b> i.e., to their respective primary categories, so that the same <i>halakhot</i> apply to them, <b>or</b> are they <b>dissimilar to them?</b>
The Gemara cites additional areas of <i>halakha</i> where there are primary categories and subcategories and considers the relationship between them: <b>With regard to Shabbat we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 73a): <b>The primary categories of labor</b> prohibited on Shabbat number <b>forty-less-one.</b> There too, from the fact that the mishna teaches its ruling employing the term: <b>Primary categories, by inference, there are</b> also <b>subcategories.</b>
With regard to the primary categories of labor prohibited on Shabbat, <b>their subcategories are similar to them,</b> as <b>it is no different</b> if one unwittingly performed labor that is <b>a primary category,</b> for which he is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering, and it is no different</b> if one unwittingly performed labor that is <b>a subcategory,</b> for which he is liable to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b> Likewise, <b>it is no different</b> if one intentionally performed labor that is <b>a primary category,</b> for which he is liable to be executed by <b>stoning, and it is no different</b> if one intentionally performed labor that is <b>a subcategory,</b> for which he is liable to be executed by <b>stoning.</b>
<b>And what</b> difference <b>is there between a primary category and a subcategory?</b> The Gemara explains: The practical <b>difference</b> is <b>that if one</b> unwittingly <b>performs two</b> labors classified as different <b>primary categories together,</b> during a single lapse of awareness, or, <b>alternatively,</b> if one unwittingly performs <b>two</b> labors classified as <b>subcategories</b> of two different primary categories <b>together,</b> during a single lapse of awareness, <b>one is liable</b> to bring a sin-offering <b>for each and every</b> labor that he performed. Each primary category of labor is an independent transgression. <b>While if one</b> unwittingly <b>performs</b> a labor that is <b>a primary category and</b> another labor classified as <b>its subcategory</b> during a single lapse of awareness, <b>he is liable</b> to bring <b>only one</b> sin-offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Eliezer, who deems one liable</b> to bring two sin-offerings even if one performs a labor classified as <b>a subcategory together with</b> a labor that is <b>its primary category, why is</b> one labor <b>characterized</b> as <b>a primary category and why is</b> the other labor <b>characterized</b> as <b>a subcategory?</b> The Gemara explains: Of the labors prohibited on Shabbat, <b>that which was a significant</b> labor <b>in the Tabernacle,</b> the Sages <b>characterized</b> it as <b>a primary category,</b> and <b>that which was not a significant labor in the Tabernacle,</b> the Sages <b>characterized</b> it as <b>a subcategory.</b> The labors prohibited on Shabbat are derived from the labors employed in the construction of the Tabernacle; therefore, their classification is also based on their significance in its construction.
<b>With regard to ritual impurities, we learned</b> in the mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 1:1): <b>The primary categories of ritual impurity</b> are as follows: Any of the eight species of <b>the creeping animal</b> enumerated in the Torah (Leviticus 11:29–30), <b>and semen,</b>

Daf 2b

<b>and one who is impure</b> with impurity imparted by a human <b>corpse.</b> A person, a vessel, or food that is rendered impure through contact with an item classified as a primary category of ritual impurity is characterized as a subcategory. In that domain, <b>their subcategories are dissimilar to them, as</b> any person or item classified as <b>a primary category</b> of ritual impurity <b>impurifies a person and</b> impurifies any <b>vessels</b> with which it comes into contact, <b>while</b> a person or item classified as <b>a subcategory of ritual impurity impurifies food or drink, but does not impurify a person or vessels.</b>
After determining that there are instances where the legal status of subcategories is like that of primary categories, e.g., Shabbat, and there are instances where the legal status of subcategories is dissimilar to that of primary categories, e.g., ritual impurity, the Gemara asks: <b>Here,</b> with regard to the laws of damages, <b>what</b> is the relationship between the primary categories and their subcategories? <b>Rav Pappa said: There are, among</b> the primary categories of damage, some whose subcategories <b>are similar to them, and there are, among them,</b> some whose subcategories <b>are dissimilar to them.</b>
§ Seeking to clarify Rav Pappa’s statement, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that delineates the primary categories of damage. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Three primary categories</b> of damage <b>were stated</b> in the Torah <b>with regard to an ox.</b> An ox causes damage in three ways, and each is classified as a distinct primary category of damage represented by a part of the body of the ox: There is <b>the</b> category of <b>Goring [<i>keren</i>],</b> literally, horn. This is referring to an ox goring a person or an animal and causing damage. <b>And</b> there is <b>the</b> category of <b>Eating [<i>shen</i>],</b> literally, tooth. This is referring to one’s ox causing damage by consuming another person’s produce. <b>And</b> there is <b>the</b> category of <b>Trampling [<i>regel</i>],</b> literally, foot. This is referring to an ox trampling another person’s belongings and causing damage. These are classified as primary categories because they are mentioned explicitly in the Torah.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>From where do we</b> derive the primary category of <b>Goring?</b> The source is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28); and <b>goring is</b> performed <b>only</b> with <b>a horn, as it is stated: “And Zedekiah, son of Chenaanah, made himself horns of iron, and said: So says the Lord: With these shall you gore the Arameans,</b> until they are consumed” (I Kings 22:11). <b>And</b> the verse also <b>states: “His firstborn bull, majesty is his, and his horns are the horns of the wild ox; with them he shall gore the nations”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17).
The Gemara interrupts its citation of the <i>baraita</i> and asks: <b>What</b> is the purpose of citing the additional verse introduced with the term: <b>And</b> the verse also <b>states?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say</b> that the first verse cited is not a legitimate source as it is a verse from the Prophets, and <b>we do not derive Torah matters from the texts of the tradition,</b> i.e., Prophets and Writings, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from the Torah: <b>“His firstborn bull, majesty is his.”</b>
The Gemara rejects the possibility that the reason a second verse was cited is that the primary category of Goring cannot be derived from a verse in the Prophets: <b>But is this</b> a halakhic <b>derivation? It is a mere disclosure of the matter, that goring is</b> performed <b>with a horn.</b> A verse in the Prophets can certainly serve as a source for that disclosure.
<b>Rather,</b> the reason the <i>baraita</i> cites a second verse is <b>lest you say,</b> based on the first verse, that <b>when the Merciful One distinguishes between</b> liability for damage caused by <b>an innocuous</b> ox, for which the owner is liable to pay half of the damages for the first three times that it gores, <b>and</b> liability for damage caused by <b>a forewarned</b> ox, which already gored three times and whose owner was cautioned to prevent the ox from goring, for which he is liable to pay the full damages, <b>that statement</b> applies only to damage caused <b>with a detached</b> horn, like the horn of Zedekiah described in the verse, e.g., if an animal held a detached horn in its mouth and caused damage with it; <b>but</b> for damage that an ox caused <b>with</b> a horn <b>attached</b> to its head, <b>say</b> that in <b>all</b> cases the legal status of the ox <b>is</b> that of <b>a forewarned</b> ox and its owner is liable to pay for all of the damage.
Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> says: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from another verse: <b>“His firstborn bull, majesty is his,</b> and his horns are the horns of the wild ox; with them he shall gore the nations,” where the reference is to a horn attached to the ox’s head. Evidently, when an ox gores with its own horns there is a distinction between an innocuous ox and a forewarned ox.
The Gemara resumes its citation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is a subcategory of Goring?</b> It includes any action that an ox performs with its body with the objective of inflicting damage: <b>Pushing [<i>negifa</i>], biting, crouching</b> upon items with the objective of inflicting damage, <b>and kicking.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>goring that it is characterized</b> as <b>a primary category</b> of damage, <b>as it is written</b> explicitly in the verse: “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28); accordingly, <b><i>negifa</i></b> should <b>also</b> be characterized as a primary category, <b>as it is written: “If</b> one man’s ox <b>hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ]</b> the ox of another” (Exodus 21:35)? The Gemara answers: <b>This <i>negifa</i></b> mentioned in the verse, <b>is</b> actually a reference to <b>goring, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verses states: “And if one man’s ox hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ] the ox of another…or if it is known that the ox was a goring ox in time past” (Exodus 21:35–36). The verse <b>began</b> its description of the case <b>with</b> the term <b><i>negifa</i> and</b> it <b>concluded with</b> the term <b>goring to say to you</b> that in this context the two terms describe the same action: <b>This</b> action <b>is <i>negifa</i></b> and <b>this</b> same action <b>is goring.</b>
The Gemara asks: If the two terms are interchangeable, <b>what is different with regard to</b> an ox goring <b>a person that it is written:</b> “And <b>if</b> an ox <b>gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28), <b>and what is different with regard to</b> an ox goring <b>an animal that it is written: “If</b> one man’s ox <b>hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ]</b> the ox of another” (Exodus 21:35)?
The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>a person, who has</b> the <b>ingenuity</b> to defend himself and is not easily injured, <b>it is written: “If</b> an ox <b>gores,”</b> a term indicating an attack of greater force. With regard to <b>an animal, which does not have</b> the <b>ingenuity</b> to defend itself and is more easily injured, <b>it is written: “If</b> an ox <b>hurts [<i>yiggof</i> ],”</b> a term indicating an attack of lesser force. The term <i>yiggof</i> is related to the term <i>magefa</i>, meaning plague. The Torah employs that term with regard to the goring of an animal to indicate that when an animal is gored, regardless of the force of the blow, it will likely result in its death.
<b>And</b> the Torah’s use of these terms <b>teaches us a matter in passing:</b> Because the effort required for the ox to gore a person to death is greater than the effort required for the ox to gore an animal to death, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> an ox that is <b>forewarned with regard to</b> goring <b>a person is</b> also <b>forewarned with regard to an animal. But</b> an ox that is <b>forewarned with regard to an animal is not forewarned with regard to a person.</b>
The Gemara questions the classification in the <i>baraita</i> of biting, crouching, and kicking as subcategories of Goring: Isn’t <b>biting a subcategory of Eating,</b> as the animal both eats and bites with its teeth? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> in cases included in the primary category of <b>Eating, there is pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>its</b> causing <b>damage.</b> In <b>this</b> case of damage caused by biting, <b>there is no</b> intrinsic <b>pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of the <b>damage</b> that <b>it</b> causes, as when the ox bites forcefully, the exclusive objective of the action is to cause damage.
The Gemara asks: Aren’t <b>crouching</b> upon items <b>and kicking</b> items in order to damage them each <b>a subcategory of Trampling,</b> as the animal crouches by bending its legs and kicks with its feet? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> in cases included in the primary category of Trampling, the <b>damage is commonplace,</b> as it is caused in the course of the animal’s walking; in <b>these</b> cases of crouching and kicking, the <b>damage is not commonplace,</b> as animals do not typically kick or crouch upon utensils.
After citing the subcategories listed in the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara resumes its analysis of the statement of Rav Pappa: <b>But</b> with regard to the statement <b>that Rav Pappa said: There are among them</b> some whose subcategories <b>are dissimilar to them, to which</b> primary category was Rav Pappa referring?
<b>If we say</b> that his reference was <b>to these</b> subcategories of Goring, <b>what is different</b> about <b>Goring</b> that defines it as a unique primary category? What is different is <b>that</b> the <b>objective</b> of the ox’s action <b>is to cause damage, and</b> the ox is <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you,</b> its owner. In <b>these</b> subcategories of Goring, i.e., pushing [<i>negifa</i>], biting, crouching, and kicking, <b>as well,</b> the <b>objective</b> of the oxen’s actions <b>is to cause damage, and</b> the oxen are <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>their safeguarding,</b> to prevent your oxen from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it is apparent that the status of <b>a subcategory of Goring is like</b> that of the primary category of <b>Goring, and when Rav Pappa says:</b> There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, he was referring <b>to Eating and Trampling.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Where are Eating and Trampling written</b> in the Torah that led them to be classified as primary categories? The Gemara answers: The source is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and he sends forth his animal, and it consumed in the field of another” (Exodus 22:4). The two parts of the verse are referring to different categories: <b>“And he sends forth,” this is</b> a reference to <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Trampling,</b> as sending forth results in the animal trampling another’s produce and damaging it, <b>and likewise it states:</b> “Happy are you that sow beside all waters <b>that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20). Clearly the term “send forth” is a reference to trampling by the feet of the animal.
<b>“And it consumed,” this is</b> a reference to <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Eating, and likewise it states:</b> “And I will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, <b>as one consumes with</b>

Daf 3a

<b>the tooth until it be all gone”</b> (I Kings 14:10).
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> just cited: <b>“And he sends forth,” this</b> is a reference to <b>the</b> category of <b>Trampling, and likewise it says:</b> “Happy are you that sow beside all waters <b>that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20). The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that the phrase: “And he sends forth,” is interpreted as a reference to the category of Trampling is <b>that the Merciful One writes: “That send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey.”</b> The Gemara asks: Were <b>it not for this</b> verse, <b>with regard to what would you have interpreted</b> that phrase?
<b>If</b> you say that it could have been interpreted as referring to <b>Goring,</b> that cannot be, as Goring <b>is written</b> in a different verse. <b>If</b> you say that it could have been interpreted as referring to <b>Eating,</b> that too cannot be, as Eating <b>is written</b> in a different verse. Perforce the reference is to Trampling, and the <i>baraita</i> had no need to prove this from the phrase: “That send forth the feet.”
The Gemara answers that it <b>is necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to cite the verse: “That send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey,” as it <b>could enter your mind to say</b> that both <b>this</b> phrase: “And he sends forth,” <b>and that</b> phrase: “And it consumed,” are referring <b>to</b> the primary category of <b>Eating, and that</b> phrase: “And it consumed,” is referring to a case <b>where the object</b> damaged <b>is completely destroyed,</b> and <b>this</b> phrase: “And he sends forth,” is referring to a case <b>where the object</b> damaged <b>is not completely destroyed.</b> Therefore, the verse “that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey” <b>teaches us</b> that the phrase “and he sends forth,” is referring to Trampling.
The Gemara asks: <b>And now that we have interpreted</b> that the phrase “and he sends forth” is referring <b>to Trampling, from where do we</b> derive that one is liable with regard to acts categorized as <b>Eating</b> in a case <b>where the object</b> damaged <b>is not completely destroyed?</b> The primary category of Eating is derived from the phrase “and it consumed.” The connotation of that phrase is damage in which the object is completely destroyed.
The Gemara answers: It is derived because the category of Eating is juxtaposed to and therefore <b>similar to</b> the category <b>of Trampling: Just as</b> with regard to liability for the category of <b>Trampling, it is no different</b> if <b>the object</b> damaged <b>is completely destroyed and it is no different</b> if <b>the object</b> damaged <b>is not completely destroyed; so too,</b> with regard to liability for the category of <b>Eating, it is no different</b> whether <b>the object</b> damaged <b>is completely destroyed and it is no different</b> whether <b>the object</b> damaged <b>is not completely destroyed.</b>
<b>The Master said</b> in that <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“And it consumed”</b> (Exodus 22:4), <b>this is</b> a reference to <b>the</b> category of <b>Eating. And likewise it states:</b> “And I will utterly sweep away the house of Jeroboam, <b>as one consumes with the tooth until it be all gone”</b> (I Kings 14:10). The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that the phrase “and it consumed” is interpreted as a reference to the category of Eating is <b>that the Merciful One writes: “As one consumes with the tooth until it be all gone.”</b> The Gemara asks: Were <b>it not for this</b> verse, <b>with regard to what</b> case <b>would you have interpreted</b> that phrase?
<b>If</b> you say that it could have been interpreted as referring to <b>Goring,</b> that cannot be, as Goring <b>is written</b> in a different verse. And <b>if</b> you say that it could have been interpreted as referring to <b>Trampling,</b> that too cannot be, as Trampling, <b>is written</b> in a different verse. Perforce the reference is to Eating. The Gemara answers that it <b>is necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to cite the verse: “As one consumes with the tooth until it be all gone,” as it <b>could enter your mind to say</b> that both <b>this</b> phrase: “And it consumed,” <b>and that</b> phrase: “And he sends forth,” are referring <b>to</b> the primary category of <b>Trampling, and this</b> phrase: “And it consumed,” is referring to a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>went</b> and caused damage <b>on its own,</b> and <b>that</b> phrase: “And he sends forth,” is referring to a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>sent</b> the animal to cause damage. Therefore, the verse “as one consumes with the tooth until it be all gone” <b>teaches us</b> that the phrase “and it consumed” is referring to Eating.
The Gemara asks: <b>And now that we have interpreted</b> that the phrase “and it consumed” is referring <b>to Eating, from where do we</b> derive that one is liable with regard to actions categorized as <b>Trampling</b> in a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>went</b> and caused damage <b>on its own?</b> The primary category of Trampling is derived from the phrase “and he sends forth.” The connotation of that phrase is a case where the owner sent the animal to cause damage.
The Gemara answers: It is derived because the category of Trampling is juxtaposed to and therefore <b>similar to</b> the category <b>of Eating: Just as</b> with regard to liability for the category of <b>Eating, it is no different</b> if the owner <b>sent</b> the animal to cause damage and <b>it is no different</b> if the animal <b>went</b> and caused damage <b>on its own, so too,</b> with regard to liability for the category of <b>Trampling, it is no different</b> if the owner <b>sent</b> the animal to cause damage and <b>it is no different</b> if the animal <b>went</b> and caused damage <b>on its own.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let the Merciful One write</b> only the first phrase, <b>“and he sends forth,” and there would be no need</b> to write the second phrase, <b>“and it consumed,” as</b> the phrase “and he sends forth” <b>connotes Trampling and connotes Eating. It connotes Trampling, as it is written: “That send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20), and <b>it connotes Eating, as it is written: “And the teeth of animals I will send forth against them”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:24).
The Gemara answers: <b>If not for the additional</b> phrase in the <b>verse,</b> “and it consumed,” <b>I would say</b> that the verse refers <b>either</b> to <b>this</b> category of damage <b>or</b> to <b>that</b> category of damage: It refers <b>either</b> to <b>Trampling, where its damage is</b> commonplace, <b>or</b> to <b>Eating, where there is pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>its</b> causing <b>damage.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Since</b> both interpretations <b>are</b> of <b>equal</b> validity, <b>let both of them come</b> and be derived from the verse, <b>as which of them will you exclude?</b> Since there is no reason to prefer one category over the other, perforce both are derived, and the phrase “and it consumed” is unnecessary. The Gemara answers: The additional phrase <b>is necessary,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>this matter</b> of liability <b>applies</b> only in a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>sent</b> the animal to cause damage, <b>but</b> in a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>went</b> and caused damage <b>on its own,</b> the owner would <b>not</b> be liable for the damage. Therefore, the phrase “and it consumed” <b>teaches us</b> that the owner is liable even in a case where the ox went and caused damage on its own.
Having clarified the sources for the primary categories of Eating and Trampling, the Gemara proceeds to identify their subcategories and to determine whether it was with regard to these primary categories of damage that Rav Pappa said: There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them. <b>What is a subcategory of Eating?</b> It is a case where, for example, an animal <b>rubbed against a wall for its pleasure</b> and damaged the wall, <b>or</b> where <b>it sullied produce</b> by rolling on it <b>for its pleasure.</b>
If so, <b>what is different</b> about <b>Eating</b> that it is defined as a unique primary category? What is different is <b>that there is pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>its</b> causing <b>damage, and</b> the ox is <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you,</b> its owner. In <b>these</b> subcategories of <b>Eating, as well, there is pleasure</b> for the animals <b>in</b> the course of the <b>damage</b> that <b>they</b> cause <b>and</b> the oxen are <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>their safeguarding,</b> to prevent your oxen from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b> Therefore, the subcategories of Eating are not dissimilar to the primary category. <b>Rather,</b> it is apparent that the status of <b>a sub-category of Eating is like</b> that of the primary category of <b>Eating, and when Rav Pappa says:</b> There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, he is referring <b>to a subcategory of Trampling.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is a subcategory of Trampling?</b> The classification is applied in a case where, for example, an animal <b>caused damage with its body,</b> not its legs, in the <b>course of its walking;</b> or caused damage <b>with its hair</b> that became entangled with an object in the <b>course of its walking;</b> or caused damage <b>with a rope that is upon it;</b> or caused damage <b>with a bit [<i>bifrumbiya</i>] that is in its mouth;</b> or caused damage <b>with a bell that is around its neck.</b>
If so, <b>what is different</b> about <b>Trampling</b> that it is defined as a unique category? What is different is <b>that its damage is commonplace, and</b> the animal is <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you,</b> its owner. In <b>these</b> subcategories of Trampling, <b>as well, their damage is commonplace, and</b> the oxen are <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>their safeguarding,</b> to prevent them from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b> Therefore, the subcategories of Trampling are not dissimilar to the primary category. <b>Rather,</b> it is apparent that the status of <b>a subcategory of Trampling is like</b> that of the primary category of <b>Trampling, and when Rav Pappa says:</b> There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, he is referring <b>to a subcategory of Pit.</b>
The Gemara examines that assertion: <b>What is a subcategory of Pit? If we say</b> that the <b>primary category</b> of Pit applies when, in the public domain, one leaves an uncovered pit that is <b>ten</b> handbreadths deep, and that is the pit mentioned in the Torah, <b>and a subcategory</b> of Pit applies when one leaves an uncovered pit that is <b>nine</b> handbreadths deep, there is no basis for that distinction, as <b>neither nine</b> handbreadths <b>are written</b> in the Torah, <b>nor are ten</b> handbreadths <b>written</b> in the Torah.
The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:34), <b>and the Sages have</b> an accepted <b>tradition</b> that a pit <b>ten</b> handbreadths deep <b>causes</b> the <b>death</b> of an animal that falls into it, but a pit <b>nine</b> handbreadths deep <b>causes damage</b> to an animal that falls into it but <b>does not cause death.</b> Accordingly, the pit written in the Torah (Exodus 21:33), which mentions the death of the animal that fell therein, is ten handbreadths deep. This is classified as the primary category of Pit, and a pit nine handbreadths deep is its subcategory.
The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately, this</b> pit that is ten handbreadths deep <b>is a primary category</b> of damage with regard <b>to death, and that</b> pit that is nine handbreadths deep <b>is a primary category</b> with regard <b>to damage.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> Rav Pappa’s statement: There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, was stated in reference <b>to</b> these subcategories of Pit: <b>His stone, his knife, or his load,</b> any of <b>which he placed in a public domain</b> as obstacles, <b>and they caused damage</b> when people stumbled upon them.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> where one is liable for damage caused by these obstacles? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where one declared</b> these items <b>ownerless, both according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> cited later in the Gemara, <b>these</b> cases <b>are</b> a subcategory of <b>Pit,</b> as both Rav and Shmuel agree that any obstacle declared ownerless by its owner that causes damage in the public domain is a subcategory of Pit.

Daf 3b

<b>And if</b> it is a case <b>where one did not declare them ownerless, there is still a difficulty. If</b> Rav Pappa’s statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who says: We learned</b> that one is liable for damage caused by <b>all</b> obstacles that he places in a public domain, whether or not he declares them ownerless, <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <b>one’s pit, these</b> cases <b>are</b> a subcategory of <b>Pit. And if</b> Rav Pappa’s statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who says: We learned</b> that one is liable for damage caused by <b>all</b> obstacles that he places in a public domain that he did not declare ownerless, <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <b>one’s ox</b> that gored another animal, <b>these</b> cases <b>are</b> a subcategory of <b>Ox.</b> With regard to the subcategories of Ox, the Gemara already established that their legal status is like that of the primary category of Ox.
The Gemara asks concerning an obstacle that is a subcategory of Pit: <b>What is different</b> about <b>Pit</b> that it is defined it as a unique category? It is <b>that its initial formation,</b> i.e., the digging of the pit, <b>is</b> done in a manner that can <b>result in damage, and</b> it is <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage to others, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b> In <b>these</b> subcategories of Pit, <b>too, their initial formation,</b> i.e., the placement of the obstacle in the public domain, <b>is</b> done in a manner that can <b>result in damage, and</b> they are <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>their safeguarding,</b> to prevent them from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you. Rather,</b> it is apparent that the status of <b>a subcategory of Pit is like</b> that of the primary category of <b>Pit, and when Rav Pappa says:</b> There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, he is referring <b>to a subcategory of <i>Maveh</i>.</b>
The meaning of the term <i>Maveh</i> is not clear; therefore, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the primary category of <i>Maveh</i> to whose subcategories the Gemara referred? <b>If</b> one suggests that Rav Pappa said his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who says: <i>Maveh</i>, this</b> is the category of <b>Eating,</b> this cannot be Rav Pappa’s intent. <b>But didn’t we</b> already <b>establish</b> that the legal status of <b>a subcategory of Eating is like</b> that of the primary category of <b>Eating?</b> Clearly, Rav Pappa was not referring to subcategories of <i>Maveh</i>. And <b>if</b> one suggests that Rav Pappa said his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who says: <i>Maveh</i>, this</b> is the primary category of <b>Man,</b> which includes damage caused by a person, not by his property or animals, <b>what primary categories and what subcategories are there in</b> that category? The <i>halakha</i> is the same with regard to all damage that a person causes.
<b>And if you would say</b> that there is a distinction: The <b>primary category</b> is a case where one causes damage while <b>awake,</b> and <b>a subcategory</b> is a case where one causes damage while <b>asleep; but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (26a): The legal status of <b>a person</b> is <b>always</b> that of one <b>forewarned,</b> and he is liable for any damage that he causes, <b>both</b> when <b>he is awake and</b> when <b>he is asleep?</b> Accordingly, that is not the distinction between a primary category and a subcategory.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps Rav Pappa was referring <b>to</b> cases where one causes damage with <b>his phlegm or his spittle.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> where one would be liable for damage in that case? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where</b> his phlegm and spittle <b>cause damage as they were moving</b> through the air after the person expectorated, that <b>is</b> damage caused by <b>his</b> direct <b>action</b> and there is no room to distinguish between the damage that it caused and any other damage caused by one’s direct action. <b>If</b> it is a case where his phlegm or spittle causes damage <b>after it comes to rest</b> on the ground, e.g., if one slipped in the spittle, fell, and was injured, <b>both according to Rav and according to Shmuel this is</b> a subcategory of <b>Pit,</b> as the spittle is an ownerless obstacle in the public domain. <b>Rather,</b> it is apparent that the status of <b>a subcategory of <i>Maveh</i> is like</b> that of the primary category of <b><i>Maveh</i>, and when Rav Pappa says:</b> There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them; he was referring <b>to a subcategory of Fire.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is a subcategory of Fire? If we say</b> that it is a case of <b>his stone, his knife, or his load, where he placed them on top of his roof, and they fell</b> off the roof <b>by means of a common wind, and they caused damage, what are the circumstances</b> in which one would be liable for the damage that was caused? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where</b> those items <b>caused damage as they were moving</b> through the air propelled by the wind, <b>that is</b> a case of <b>Fire.</b>
If so, <b>what is different</b> about <b>Fire</b> that defines it as a unique category? What is different is <b>that another force,</b> the wind, <b>is involved with</b> the fire in causing damage, as the wind causes the fire to spread, <b>and</b> the fire is <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b> In <b>these</b> subcategories of Fire <b>too, another force is involved with</b> the items placed on the roof and causes damage, as the wind causes them to fall, <b>and</b> they are <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>their safeguarding,</b> to prevent them from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you. Rather,</b> it is apparent that the status of <b>a subcategory of Fire is like</b> that of the primary category of <b>Fire, and when Rav Pappa says:</b> There are among them some whose subcategories are dissimilar to them, he was referring <b>to a subcategory of Trampling.</b>
The Gemara questions this explanation: A subcategory of <b>Trampling? But didn’t we</b> already <b>establish that</b> the status of <b>a subcategory of Trampling is similar to</b> that of the primary category of <b>Trampling?</b> The Gemara explains: Rav Pappa was referring <b>to</b> one’s liability to pay <b>half the</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> caused by <b>pebbles</b> in a case where they were inadvertently propelled by the foot of a walking animal, <b>which is a <i>halakha</i> learned through tradition</b> and not explicitly written in the Torah.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if it is a unique halakhic category and the payment is different, <b>why is it characterized</b> as <b>a subcategory of Trampling?</b> The Gemara explains: It is due to the fact that it shares a common aspect with Trampling. One whose animal propels pebbles while it walks and thereby causes damage is liable <b>to pay</b> half of the damages <b>from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, and he does not pay only from the body of his animal, as is the <i>halakha</i> concerning half the cost of the damage paid by the owner of an innocuous ox that gored a person or an animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rava raise a dilemma</b> with regard to that matter? <b>As Rava raised a dilemma:</b> With regard to one’s liability to pay <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> caused by <b>pebbles</b> propelled by the foot of his animal, does <b>one pay</b> damages exclusively <b>from</b> the <b>body</b> of his ox that caused the damage, <b>or</b> does <b>one pay</b> damages <b>from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property?
The Gemara explains: Although <b>it is a dilemma for Rava, it is obvious to Rav Pappa</b> that one pays from his superior-quality property, and in that sense, he classified the pebbles that cause damage as a subcategory of Trampling.
The Gemara asks: <b>According to Rava, who raises it as a dilemma, why is it characterized</b> as <b>a subcategory of Trampling</b> when its legal status is different both in terms of the extent of one’s liability and in terms of the manner of payment? The Gemara explains: It is classified as a subcategory of Trampling in order <b>to exempt</b> from liability pebbles that cause damage <b>in the public domain,</b> just as damage in the category of Trampling is exempt in the public domain.
§ One of the primary categories of damage enumerated in the mishna is <b>the</b> category of <b><i>Maveh</i> and</b> another is <b>the</b> category of <b>Fire.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>Maveh</i>? Rav says: <i>Maveh</i>, that</b> is the category of <b>Man,</b> which includes a person who causes damage, but not the property or animal of a person that causes damage. <b>And Shmuel says: <i>Maveh</i>, this</b> is <b>the</b> category of <b>Eating.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rav says: <i>Maveh</i>, this</b> is the category of <b>Man, as it is written: “The watchman said: Morning has come, and also night; if you will inquire [<i>tivayun</i>], inquire [<i>be’ayu</i>]”</b> (Isaiah 21:12). The terms “<i>tivayun</i>” and “<i>be’ayu</i>,” meaning inquire, refer to a person, who is able to inquire. Accordingly, <i>Maveh</i> relates to an action performed by a person.
<b>And Shmuel says: <i>Maveh</i>, this is the</b> category of <b>Eating, as it is written: “How is Esau searched out [<i>neḥpesu</i>]; how are his hidden places revealed [<i>nivu</i>]”</b> (Obadiah 1:6)? The terms <i>nivu</i> and <i>maveh</i> share a common root. The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred</b> that <i>nivu</i> connotes Eating? The Gemara explains that it is <b>as Rav Yosef translates</b> the verse into Aramaic: <b>How is Esau searched out [<i>itbelish</i>]; how are his hidden places revealed [<i>itgaleyan</i>]?</b> The meaning of the Aramaic term <i>itgaleyan</i> means revealed, and that is the meaning of the Hebrew term “<i>nivu</i>.” <i>Maveh</i> references the animal’s teeth, which are covered when its mouth is closed and revealed when it eats.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rav, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not say</b> that <i>Maveh</i> refers to Eating, <b>as</b> does <b>Shmuel?</b> The Gemara explains that Rav could have <b>said to you: Is it taught</b> in the mishna: <b><i>Niveh</i>?</b> <i>Niveh</i> is the passive form of the word <i>maveh</i>, which would be the appropriate form if the reference was to teeth that are revealed. The term in the mishna is <i>maveh</i>, an active form of the verb.
<b>And</b> as for <b>Shmuel, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not say</b> that <i>Maveh</i> refers to the category of Man, <b>as</b> does <b>Rav?</b> The Gemara explains that Shmuel could have <b>said to you: Is it taught</b> in the mishna: <b><i>Bo’eh</i>?</b> <i>Bo’eh</i> is a form of the word <i>maveh</i> connoting an action taken directly, which would be appropriate were the reference to one’s actions that cause damage. The term in the mishna is <i>maveh</i>, which connotes an action that one causes another to take.
The Gemara notes: <b>After all, the</b> meaning of the term in the <b>verses is not precise according to</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>and</b> it <b>is not precise according to</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Shmuel. It is apparent that their dispute is not based upon their interpretation of the verses; it must be based on another issue. The Gemara asks again: As for <b>Rav, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not say</b> that <i>Maveh</i> refers to Eating, <b>as</b> does <b>Shmuel?</b> The Gemara explains: Rav holds that the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the primary category of <b>Ox</b> in the mishna. This includes damage caused by an ox <b>and all matters</b> involving damaging actions <b>that</b> are completed by <b>an ox,</b> i.e., the actions included in the categories of Goring, Eating, and Trampling. Perforce, <i>Maveh</i> refers to a different category of damage, i.e., Man.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Shmuel too,</b> who interpreted <i>Maveh</i> as Eating, <b>doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the category of <b>Ox,</b> which should include all matters involving damaging actions that are completed by an ox? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that according to Shmuel, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches Ox</b> specifically with regard <b>to</b> damage caused with <b>its horn, and</b> it teaches <b><i>Maveh</i></b> with regard <b>to</b> damage caused with <b>its tooth. And</b> when the mishna contrasts Ox with <i>Maveh</i>, <b>this is</b> what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b> The defining <b>characteristic</b> of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Goring, where there is no</b> inherent <b>pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>its</b> causing <b>damage, is not similar to</b> the defining <b>characteristic</b> of <b>the</b> category of <b>Eating, where there is pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>its</b> causing <b>damage.</b>

Daf 4a

<b>And</b> the defining <b>characteristic [<i>re’i</i>] of the</b> category of <b>Eating, where it is not the objective of</b> the animal <b>to cause damage, is not similar to</b> the defining <b>characteristic of the</b> category of <b>Goring, where the objective</b> of the animal <b>is to cause damage.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it</b> possible to derive Goring from Eating by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If</b> in a case of <b>Eating, where it is not the objective of</b> the animal <b>to cause damage,</b> its owner <b>is liable,</b> with regard to <b>Goring, where the objective of</b> the animal <b>is to cause damage,</b> should the owner <b>not all the more so</b> be liable? The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, <b>it was necessary</b> for the Torah to state the case of Goring, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the owner is exempt, <b>just as he is</b> exempt in the case <b>where</b> his <b>slave or maidservant</b> causes damage. When <b>a slave or maidservant</b> causes damage, <b>is it not</b> so that <b>although their objective is to cause damage, even so</b> their owners <b>are exempt</b> from liability; and <b>so too,</b> when one’s animal causes damage, it <b>is no different.</b> To dispel this notion, the Torah explicitly states that one is liable for damage caused by the primary category of Goring.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Is that to say</b> that <b>in</b> a case where one’s <b>slave or maidservant</b> causes damage <b>there is not a substantial reason</b> to exempt the master? In that case there is concern that <b>perhaps his master will provoke him and</b> in retribution <b>he will go and set fire to another’s stack</b> of grain, <b>and it is found</b> that <b>this</b> slave <b>renders his master liable</b> to pay <b>one hundred <i>maneh</i>,</b> ten thousand dinars, <b>each day.</b> Therefore, there is no basis for the notion that an ox that gores would be exempt just as a slave is exempt, as perhaps, fundamentally, one is liable to pay for damage caused by his slave. A master is exempt from payment to prevent a situation where a slave would exploit that situation to take revenge against his master.
<b>Rather,</b> the mishna <b>refutes</b> any possibility to derive the <i>halakhot</i> of Ox from <i>Maveh</i> or <i>Maveh</i> from Ox in <b>this</b> manner: The <b>characteristic of the</b> category of <b>Goring, where</b> the <b>objective</b> of the animal <b>is to cause damage, is not similar to</b> the <b>characteristic of the</b> category of <b>Eating, where it is not the objective of</b> the animal <b>to cause damage, and</b> the <b>characteristic of the</b> category of <b>Eating, where there is pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>its</b> causing <b>damage, is not similar to</b> the <b>characteristic of the</b> category of <b>Goring, where there is no pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>its</b> causing <b>damage.</b>
According to Rav Yehuda’s explanation of Shmuel’s opinion, among the primary categories of damage caused by an ox, the mishna mentions only Goring and Eating. The Gemara asks: <b>But what</b> of the category of <b>Trampling;</b> did the <i>tanna</i> <b>omit it</b> from the mishna? The Gemara answers: The principle stated in general terms at the end of the mishna: <b>And when</b> a component of any of these categories <b>causes damage, the</b> owner or generator of the component that <b>caused damage is obligated</b> to remit payments of restitution for damage with best-quality land, serves <b>to include</b> the primary category of <b>Trampling.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the intent of the <i>tanna</i> is to teach the primary category of Trampling as well, <b>let him teach it explicitly.</b> Accordingly, Rav Yehuda’s explanation of how Shmuel interprets the mishna is rejected.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that according to Shmuel, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches Ox</b> specifically with regard <b>to</b> actions that cause damage with <b>its foot and</b> it teaches <b><i>Maveh</i></b> with regard <b>to</b> actions that cause damage with <b>its tooth. And</b> when the mishna contrasts Ox with <i>Maveh</i> <b>this is</b> what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b> The defining <b>characteristic</b> of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Trampling, where its damage is commonplace, is not similar to</b> the defining <b>characteristic of the</b> primary category of <b>Eating, where its damage is not commonplace, and</b> the defining <b>characteristic</b> of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Eating, where there is pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>its</b> causing <b>damage, is not similar to</b> the <b>characteristic of the</b> primary category of <b>Trampling, where there is no pleasure</b> for the animal <b>in</b> the course of <b>its</b> causing <b>damage.</b>
According to Rav Yehuda’s explanation of Shmuel’s opinion, among the primary categories of damage with regard to an ox, the mishna mentions only Goring and Trampling. The Gemara asks: <b>But what</b> of the primary category of <b>Goring;</b> did the <i>tanna</i> <b>omit it</b> from the mishna? The Gemara answers: The principle stated in general terms at the end of the mishna: <b>And when</b> a component of any of these categories <b>causes damage, the</b> owner or generator of the component that <b>caused damage is obligated</b> to remit payments of restitution for damage with best-quality land, serves <b>to include</b> the primary category of <b>Goring.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the intent of the <i>tanna</i> is to teach the primary category of Goring as well, <b>let him teach it explicitly.</b> The Gemara explains: It is <b>with regard to</b> those categories of damage where the animal is <b>forewarned from the outset</b> and the owner is liable to pay for the entire damage the first time his animal causes damage that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>speaks;</b> but <b>with regard to</b> those categories of damage where the animal is initially <b>innocuous</b> and the owner is liable to pay only half the cost of the damage caused by his animal, <b>and</b> the animal is <b>ultimately forewarned,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>does not speak</b> of them. With regard to Goring, the first three times an ox gores a person or an animal the owner of the ox pays only half of the damages. This is because an ox is considered forewarned with regard to damage categorized as Goring only after it attacks three times.
After addressing the reason that Rav did not say that <i>Maveh</i> refers to Eating in accordance with the explanation of Shmuel, the Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Shmuel, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not say</b> that <i>Maveh</i> refers to Man, <b>as</b> does <b>Rav?</b> Shmuel could have <b>said to you, if it enters your mind</b> to say that <i>Maveh</i> is <b>Man, isn’t it taught in the latter clause</b> of the mishna (15b): Both <b>a forewarned ox, and an ox that causes damage in the domain of the injured</b> party, <b>and</b> any damage caused by <b>man?</b> Apparently, Man was mentioned in the latter clause of the mishna because it was not mentioned in the first clause.
The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> Man among the primary categories of damage <b>in the first clause.</b> The Gemara explains: It is <b>with regard to</b> those categories of <b>damage</b> caused by one’s <b>property</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>speaks;</b> but <b>with regard to</b> the category of <b>damage</b> caused by <b>one’s body,</b> the category of Man, the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>does not speak.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rav, too,</b> the same difficulty arises: <b>Isn’t</b> damage caused by a <b>man taught in the latter clause</b> of the mishna? The Gemara answers: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: That</b> mention of damage caused by a man in the latter clause <b>comes to enumerate</b> that damage <b>together with</b> the other forms of damage in a case where the owner of the cause of damage or the generator of that damage is <b>forewarned.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to Rav, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the statement in the mishna: The defining characteristic of the primary category of Ox <b>is not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of the primary category of <i>Maveh</i>?
The Gemara explains: <b>This is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> The defining <b>characteristic of the</b> primary category of <b>Ox, where</b> if the ox kills a person the owner <b>pays the ransom</b> to the heirs of the injured party, <b>is not similar to</b> the defining <b>characteristic of the</b> primary category of <b>Man, where</b> one who kills another <b>does not pay the ransom</b> for killing him; rather, if he killed him unwittingly he is exiled and if he did so intentionally he is executed. And the defining <b>characteristic of the</b> primary category of <b>Man, where</b> if one injures another <b>he is liable to</b> pay <b>four types of indemnity,</b> i.e., pain, humiliation, medical costs, and the loss of livelihood, in addition to payment for the damage, <b>is not similar to</b> the defining <b>characteristic of the</b> primary category of <b>Ox, where</b> the owner of the ox <b>is not liable to</b> pay <b>four types of indemnity</b> and is liable to pay only the cost of the damage.
The Gemara questions Rav’s understanding that Ox, as mentioned in the mishna, includes all actions an ox performs that cause damage, including goring, based on the continuation of the mishna: <b>The common denominator of</b> the components in all <b>these</b> primary categories of damage is <b>that</b> it is <b>their</b> typical <b>manner to cause damage.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But is it the</b> typical <b>manner of an ox to cause damage</b> by goring? The Gemara answers: The statement in the mishna is <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox. The Gemara asks: <b>But is it the</b> typical <b>manner of a forewarned</b> ox <b>to cause damage</b> by goring? The Gemara answers: Yes, <b>once it was forewarned</b> after goring repeatedly, <b>its</b> typical <b>manner is</b> to cause damage by goring.
The Gemara questions Rav’s understanding that <i>Maveh</i> is the primary category of Man: Is it <b>man’s</b> typical <b>manner to cause damage?</b> The Gemara answers: The statement in the mishna is <b>referring to</b> the damage one causes while <b>sleeping.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is it the</b> typical <b>manner of</b> a person <b>to cause damage</b> while <b>sleeping?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> one <b>contracts and extends</b> his limbs while sleeping, <b>it is his</b> typical <b>manner</b> to damage objects placed next to him.
If <i>Maveh</i> is referring to Man, is it correct to state, as the mishna does in its enumeration of common denominators of the primary categories: <b>And</b> responsibility for <b>their safeguarding</b> is incumbent <b>upon you?</b> That formulation is appropriate in cases where one is safeguarding another person, animal, or item. When applied to the primary category of Man, it would indicate that responsibility to safeguard one person is incumbent upon another person. With regard to <b>man,</b> responsibility for <b>safeguarding his body is</b> incumbent <b>upon him</b> alone, not upon anyone else.
The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> that the formulation: And their safeguarding is incumbent upon you, indicates that <i>Maveh</i> is not Man, there is a difficulty with <b>that which</b> the Sage <b>Karna taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There are <b>four primary categories of damage, and Man is one of them.</b> That <i>baraita</i> continues and states that one common denominator is: Their safeguarding is incumbent upon you. With regard to that <i>baraita</i>, the same question arises: With regard to <b>Man,</b> responsibility for <b>safeguarding his body is</b> incumbent <b>upon him,</b> not upon anyone else, and the wording of Karna is imprecise. <b>Rather,</b> just <b>as Rabbi Abbahu said to the <i>tanna</i>,</b> who was reciting the <i>baraita</i> in the study hall: <b>Teach</b> the <i>baraita</i>: And with regard to <b>Man,</b> responsibility for <b>safeguarding his body is</b> incumbent <b>upon him;</b>

Daf 4b

<b>here too, teach</b> the mishna: And with regard to <b>man,</b> responsibility for <b>safeguarding his body is</b> incumbent <b>upon him.</b>
§ <b>Rav Mari objects to</b> the Gemara’s initial suggestion that the dispute between Rav and Shmuel with regard to the meaning of <i>Maveh</i> is based on biblical terms with similar etymology. He suggests: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b><i>Maveh</i>, this</b> is <b>the</b> primary category of damage caused by <b>water, as it is written: “As when fire ignites brushwood; fire boils [<i>tiveh</i>] water”</b> (Isaiah 64:1). The terms <i>tiveh</i> and <i>maveh</i> share a common root, and the reference is to water. The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is it written</b> in the verse: <b>Water boils [<i>nivu</i>]</b> from fire, with water, a plural noun in Hebrew, the subject of the intransitive plural verb, <i>nivu</i>? No, <b>“fire boils [<i>tiveh</i>] water” is written,</b> and since <i>tiveh</i> is a transitive singular verb, the subject is fire, which is a singular noun. Therefore, no proof can be adduced from this verse that <i>Maveh</i> refers to an action performed with water.
<b>Rav Zevid objects to</b> the Gemara’s initial suggestion that the dispute between Rav and Shmuel with regard to the meaning of <i>Maveh</i> is based on biblical terms with similar etymology. He suggests: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b><i>Maveh</i>, this is the</b> primary category of <b>Fire, as when</b> the term <b>“<i>tiveh</i>” is written</b> in the verse cited by Rav Mari, <b>it is written with regard to Fire.</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when the mishna enumerates the primary categories of damage: <b>The</b> category of <b><i>Maveh</i> and the</b> category of <b>Fire,</b> indicating that they are two distinct categories? <b>And if you would say</b> that these are not two distinct categories but rather the mishna <b>is explaining</b> the meaning of <i>Maveh</i>, <b>if so,</b> why does the mishna say: There are <b>four</b> primary categories of damage? <b>There are</b> only <b>three.</b>
<b>And if you would say</b> that <i>Maveh</i> is Fire, and there are four categories in the mishna, as the mishna <b>teaches</b> the primary category of <b>Ox, in which there are two</b> primary categories of damage, Eating and Trampling, the mishna remains difficult. <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that <i>Maveh</i> in the mishna is referring to Fire, what is the meaning of that which the mishna states with regard to the common denominator of <i>Maveh</i> and Ox: <b>And</b> the defining characteristics of <b>this</b> category of Ox <b>and that</b> category of <i>Maveh</i>, <b>in which there is a living spirit,</b> are <b>not</b> similar to the defining characteristic of the next category in the mishna, in which there is no living spirit. Accordingly, how can <i>Maveh</i> mean Fire; <b>what living spirit is there in Fire? And furthermore,</b> if <i>Maveh</i> is Fire, what is the meaning of the next phrase in the mishna: They <b>are not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> category of <b>Fire,</b> in which there is no living spirit. Clearly, <i>Maveh</i> is not Fire.
§ Contrary to the mishna, where four primary categories of damage were enumerated, <b>Rabbi Oshaya taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:1) that there are <b>thirteen primary categories of damage.</b> The thirteen categories consist of four bailees, five types of indemnity, and the four primary categories listed in the mishna. The four bailees are: The <b>unpaid bailee,</b> who is liable for damage caused by his negligence; <b>and the borrower,</b> who is liable for all damage; the <b>paid bailee, and the renter,</b> who is liable if the object is lost or stolen. The five types of indemnity one is liable to pay for injuring another person are: <b>Damage,</b> i.e., the decrease in the injured party’s value; <b>pain; and medical costs; loss of livelihood; and humiliation</b> that the injured party suffered from the assault. <b>And</b> with <b>the four</b> primary categories enumerated in <b>the mishna, that</b> is a total of <b>thirteen.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>does not teach these</b> nine categories and enumerates only four? <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> who says that <i>Maveh</i> is Eating, it is <b>with regard to</b> the categories of <b>damage</b> caused by one’s <b>property</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>speaks. With regard to</b> categories of <b>damage</b> caused by <b>one’s body,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>does not speak,</b> and the additional categories of Rabbi Oshaya are damage caused by one’s body. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> who says that <i>Maveh</i> is Man, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teach</b> these nine categories as well. The Gemara answers: According to Rav, the mishna <b>teaches</b> the primary category of <b>Man, and</b> included in that category are <b>all matters</b> of damage that are caused by <b>man,</b> among them the categories added by Rabbi Oshaya.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Oshaya too, doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the primary category of <b>Man?</b> Why then did he enumerate the four bailees and the five types of indemnity? The Gemara answers: In his enumeration, Rabbi Oshaya distinguishes between <b>two types of</b> damage caused by <b>a man:</b> He <b>teaches</b> cases involving <b>a man who injures</b> another <b>person, and</b> he <b>teaches</b> the primary category of <i>Maveh</i>, which involves the cases of <b>a man who damages an ox</b> or damages other property belonging to another person.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> with regard to <b>Ox as well, let him teach two categories of Ox. Let him teach</b> the case of <b>an ox that damages an ox</b> or other property belonging to another person, <b>and let him teach</b> the case of <b>an ox that injures a person.</b>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>What is this</b> comparison? <b>Granted,</b> in the case of <b>a man who damages</b> another’s <b>ox</b> or other property, <b>he pays</b> merely for the <b>damage;</b> in the case of <b>a man who injures</b> another <b>person, he pays</b> an additional <b>four types</b> of indemnity payments: Pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation. <b>But</b> with regard to damage caused by <b>an ox, what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if it is <b>an ox that damages an ox</b> or other property belonging to another person and <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if it is <b>an ox that injures a person?</b> In both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case the owner of the ox <b>pays</b> merely for the <b>damage.</b> Therefore, unlike a case where a person causes the damage, there is no reason to distinguish between cases where an ox causes damage based on the victim of that damage.
With regard to the assertion that Rabbi Oshaya added only cases involving a man who injures another person, the Gemara asks: <b>But aren’t</b> there the categories of the <b>unpaid bailee and the borrower,</b> the <b>paid bailee and the renter, which are</b> categories that describe <b>a man who damages</b> another’s <b>ox</b> or other property, as the cases referred to by Rabbi Oshaya are those where the bailee fails to return the deposit that he was entrusted to safeguard? <b>And</b> yet Rabbi Oshaya <b>teaches</b> each type of bailee as distinct categories and does not include them under the rubric of Man, one of the four categories enumerated in the mishna.
The Gemara answers that the reason why Rabbi Oshaya enumerates Man separately from the bailees is that he <b>teaches</b> one category, Man, referring to <b>damage that</b> is engendered <b>by</b> direct <b>action,</b> e.g., the five types of indemnity payments, <b>and</b> he <b>teaches</b> the four bailees, referring to <b>damage that occurs on its own,</b> e.g., failure of the four bailees to safeguard the deposit.
The Gemara cites a third listing of primary categories of damage. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> that there are <b>twenty-four primary categories of damage: Payment of double</b> the principal, paid by a thief who is apprehended and convicted based on the testimony of witnesses and who does not admit his crime; <b>and payment of four or five</b> times the principal, paid by a thief who steals an ox or sheep, respectively, and then slaughters or sells it; <b>and</b> payment of the principal, by <b>a thief</b> who admits his crime; <b>and a robber, who</b> steals openly and by force or threat of violence; <b>and conspiring witnesses</b> who pay the individual against whom they falsely testified with regard to a sum that they conspired to cause him to lose.
<b>And the rapist, and the seducer,</b> who seduces an unmarried young woman, who pay a fine of fifty <i>sela</i>; <b>and the defamer,</b> i.e., one who defames his wife by claiming falsely in court that he discovered that she was not a virgin when he consummated the marriage and alleges that she engaged in intercourse with another man while betrothed, who pays a fine of one hundred <i>sela</i>; <b>and one who causes</b> another’s <i>teruma</i> <b>to become ritually impure,</b> rendering it prohibited to partake of that <i>teruma</i>; <b>and one who mixes</b> <i>teruma</i> with another’s non-sacred food, rendering it prohibited for any non-priest to partake of it; <b>and one who pours</b> another’s wine <b>as a libation</b> for idolatry. When one combines the eleven categories enumerated by <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya and these thirteen</b> categories enumerated by Rabbi Oshaya, <b>this</b> totals <b>twenty-four</b> principal categories of damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Oshaya, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not teach these</b> eleven additional categories? The Gemara answers: It is <b>with regard to</b> cases where one is liable to pay <b>monetary restitution</b> that Rabbi Oshaya <b>speaks. With regard to</b> cases where one is liable to pay <b>a fine,</b> Rabbi Oshaya <b>does not speak.</b>
The Gemara asks: What of the cases of <b>a thief and a robber, which</b> are cases where one is liable to pay <b>monetary restitution? Let</b> Rabbi Oshaya also <b>teach</b> those cases and include them in his list. The Gemara answers: <b>Doesn’t he teach</b> those cases, as he enumerates in his list the <b>unpaid bailee and the borrower?</b> An unpaid bailee who takes a false oath that the deposit was stolen, when in fact it remained in his possession, is liable to pay restitution like a thief.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> as for <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya too, doesn’t he teach</b> those cases; as he enumerates in his list the <b>unpaid bailee and the borrower?</b> Why does Rabbi Ḥiyya list them separately? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ḥiyya makes a distinction between different types of theft: He <b>teaches</b> cases of theft with regard to <b>property that came into</b> one’s <b>possession in a permitted</b> manner, e.g., an unpaid bailee who was entrusted with a deposit and later misappropriated it, <b>and</b> he <b>teaches</b> cases of theft with regard to <b>property that came into</b> one’s <b>possession in a prohibited</b> manner, e.g., the actions of a thief and a robber.

Daf 5a

The Gemara asks: With regard to the payment made by <b>conspiring witnesses, which is</b> categorized as <b>monetary restitution,</b> as the witnesses pay the precise sum that they conspired to cause the defendant to lose, <b>let</b> Rabbi Oshaya also <b>teach it</b> as one of the categories on his list. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Oshaya <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that conspiring witnesses <b>do not pay on the basis of their own</b> admission. Evidently, theirs is not a payment of monetary restitution; rather, it is a fine, as only one who was found liable based on the testimony of witnesses pays a fine, not one who was found liable based on his own admission.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> Rabbi Oshaya <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, let him teach two</b> distinct <b>types of</b> categories of damage under the rubric of <b>Ox: Let him teach</b> one category for <b>an ox that damages an ox</b> or other property belonging to another person, <b>and let him</b> also <b>teach</b> the case of <b>an ox that injures a person.</b>
The Gemara explains its question: <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (33a): In a case where the two parties damaged each other concurrently, <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The owner of the <b>innocuous</b> ox <b>that injured a person also pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage with regard to the difference</b> between the damage caused by his ox and the damage that the person caused the ox. Rabbi Akiva holds that if an innocuous ox injures a person, the owner pays the full cost of the damage, whereas if an innocuous ox damages another’s property then the owner is liable only for half the cost of the damage. Since the owner’s liability in the two cases is different, each case should be classified as a distinct category, and Rabbi Oshaya should list them separately in his <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara answers: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Akiva break</b> the force of <b>his fist [<i>gezizeih</i>],</b> i.e., he significantly tempered the force of his statement, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> in the case of <b>an innocuous ox that injured a person,</b> the owner of the ox <b>would pay from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property and not merely from the body of his animal, as in the case of an innocuous ox that damages property; therefore, <b>the verse states</b> with regard to an ox that gores a person: “According to this judgment <b>shall it be done to him”</b> (Exodus 21:31), from which it is derived that the owner of the ox <b>pays</b> restitution exclusively <b>from</b> proceeds of the sale of the <b>body</b> of his ox, <b>and he does not pay from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property. The mishna states that one pays restitution from his superior-quality property in instances of all primary categories of damage. Since in the case of an innocuous ox that injured a person even Rabbi Akiva concedes that the owner does not pay from his superior-quality property, it should not be included in a list of the primary categories.
The Gemara asks: As for <b>the rapist, and the seducer, and the defamer,</b> all of <b>which are</b> cases in which the offender pays <b>monetary restitution, let</b> Rabbi Oshaya <b>teach</b> them as categories in his list.
The Gemara explains why Rabbi Oshaya did not teach them as separate categories: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, they should not be listed. <b>If</b> the payments listed by Rabbi Ḥiyya are for <b>damage</b> caused to the woman’s body, which reduces her value, he already <b>taught it; if</b> the payments are for <b>pain,</b> he already <b>taught it; if</b> the payments are for <b>humiliation,</b> he already <b>taught it; if</b> the payment is for <b>degradation, that</b> too <b>is</b> a payment for <b>damage,</b> which he already taught. <b>What,</b> then, <b>have you to say?</b> What is the nature of the payments paid by the rapist and the seducer mentioned by Rabbi Ḥiyya? In these cases, each payment paid is considered <b>a fine [<i>kenasa</i>],</b> and as explained, <b>with regard to</b> cases in which one is liable to pay <b>a fine,</b> Rabbi Oshaya <b>does not speak.</b>
The Gemara asks further: <b>And one who causes</b> another’s <i>teruma</i> <b>to become ritually impure, and one who mixes</b> <i>teruma</i> with another’s non-sacred food, <b>and one who pours</b> another’s wine <b>as a libation</b> for idolatry, each of <b>which is</b> a case in which the offender must pay <b>monetary restitution</b> to compensate the owner for his loss due to the lowered value of his food or wine, <b>let</b> Rabbi Oshaya <b>teach</b> them as categories in his list.
The Gemara answers: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, these cases should not be listed. <b>If</b> Rabbi Oshaya holds that <b>damage that is not evident,</b> i.e., where the object is physically unchanged but its halakhic status is changed, <b>is characterized as damage</b> for which one is liable to pay restitution, Rabbi Oshaya already <b>taught,</b> i.e., included in his list, restitution for <b>damage,</b> and <b>if</b> he holds that <b>damage that is not evident is not characterized as damage</b> for which one is liable to pay restitution, then <b>it is a fine, and,</b> as explained, <b>with regard to</b> cases for which one is liable to pay <b>a fine,</b> Rabbi Oshaya <b>does not speak.</b>
The Gemara suggests: Since Rabbi Ḥiyya lists these cases as distinct categories, <b>let us say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya holds</b> that <b>damage that is not evident is not characterized as damage</b> for which one is liable to pay restitution, <b>as, if it were characterized as damage</b> for which one is liable to pay restitution, <b>didn’t</b> he already <b>teach,</b> i.e., include in his list, restitution for <b>damage?</b> The Gemara rejects that suggestion: Even if he holds that damage that is evident is characterized as damage for which one is liable to pay restitution, he distinguishes between different types of damage. He <b>teaches</b> cases of <b>damage that is evident and</b> he <b>teaches</b> cases of <b>damage that is not evident.</b>
The Gemara considers the fact that each of the lists of primary categories is introduced with the number that they total: <b>Granted, according to the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, he <b>taught the number</b> of four primary categories in introducing his list <b>to exclude</b> those additional categories <b>of Rabbi Oshaya. And</b> similarly, <b>Rabbi Oshaya taught the number</b> of thirteen primary categories <b>to exclude</b> those additional categories <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya. But what</b> does <b>the number</b> of twenty-four primary categories <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> serve <b>to exclude?</b>
The Gemara answers: He taught that number in order <b>to exclude</b> the cases of <b>an informer,</b> who provides information to the authorities leading them to confiscate another person’s property; <b>and</b> to exclude the case of a priest who <b>renders</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i></b> by performing the sacrificial rites for one offering with the intent to sacrifice it for the sake of another offering, in which case the person who brought the offering must replace it with another.
The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>teach</b> these cases. <b>Granted,</b> he did not include the case of a priest <b>who renders</b> an offering <b><i>piggul</i>.</b> Perhaps, <b>with regard to</b> cases involving <b>consecrated</b> items, Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>does not speak. But</b> with regard to the case of <b>an informer, what is the reason</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>did not teach it</b> and include it in his list of categories? The Gemara answers: The case of <b>an informer is different, as</b> the damage is caused through <b>speech, and with regard to</b> damage caused through <b>speech,</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>does not speak.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> there the case of <b>a defamer, where</b> the damage <b>is</b> caused through <b>speech, and</b> yet Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>teaches</b> it and includes it in his list? The Gemara answers: He includes that case because <b>it is</b> a case of <b>speech that involves an action.</b> One who defames his wife is liable only if he made his allegation after engaging in intercourse with her.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> the case of <b>conspiring witnesses</b> a case of <b>speech that involves no action,</b> as they are liable for their testimony, <b>and</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>teaches</b> it and includes it in his list? The Gemara answers: <b>There, although it involves no action, the Merciful One characterizes it</b> as <b>an action, as it is written: “And you shall do to him as he conspired to do unto his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19).
The Gemara considers the subcategories of the various primary categories listed: <b>Granted, according to the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, his terminology is understandable, as <b>he taught primary categories,</b> which, <b>by inference,</b> means <b>that there are</b> also additional forms of damage that are <b>subcategories</b> of those primary categories. <b>But</b> according <b>to Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Oshaya,</b> why did they employ the terminology they employed? They employed the term <b>primary categories,</b> which, <b>by inference,</b> means <b>that there are subcategories. What are the subcategories</b> of the primary categories they listed? It appears that they enumerated all the various categories of damage.
<b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> When Rabbi Ḥiyya and Rabbi Oshaya characterize, as primary categories, the various categories of damage that they listed, it is not to indicate that there are subcategories; rather, it is to indicate that <b>all of them are characterized as primary categories,</b> in the sense that one is liable <b>to pay from</b> one’s <b>best</b>-quality property.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this, i.e., from where is it derived? The Gemara explains: It <b>is derived</b> using a verbal analogy from the terms <b>“in place of,” “giving,” “he shall pay,”</b> and <b>“money.”</b> The term “in place of” is written with regard to a forewarned ox that gores (Exodus 21:36); “he shall give” is written with regard to an ox that kills a slave (Exodus 21:32); “he shall pay” is written with regard to the categories of damage of Eating and Trampling (Exodus 22:4); and “money” is written with regard to Pit (Exodus 21:34). The <i>halakha</i> that one must pay from his best-quality property is stated explicitly in each of those four verses. In each of the twenty-four categories listed by Rabbi Ḥiyya one of those four terms is written, so by means of a verbal analogy, the requirement to pay from one’s best-quality property applies to each of them.
§ The mishna states: The defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Ox is not similar to</b> the defining characteristic of <b>the</b> primary category of <b><i>Maveh</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the mishna <b>saying? Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava</b> that <b>this is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying: Let the Merciful One write one</b> of the primary categories <b>and derive the other</b> categories <b>from it. Then</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>says:</b> It is <b>not</b> possible to <b>derive one</b> category <b>from one</b> other category, as each category has its unique characteristics.
The mishna continues: <b>And</b> the defining characteristics of <b>this</b> category of Ox <b>and that</b> category of <i>Maveh</i>, <b>in which there is a living spirit,</b> are not similar to the defining characteristic of the category of Fire, in which there is no living spirit. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>saying? Rav Mesharshiyya said in the name of Rava</b> that <b>this is</b> what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b>

Daf 5b

<b>Let the Merciful One write</b> only <b>two</b> of the primary categories <b>and derive</b> the <b>other</b> categories <b>from them. Then</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>says:</b> It is <b>not</b> possible to <b>derive one</b> category <b>from two</b> other categories, as each category has its own unique characteristics, which prevent the derivation of a new category even from a combination of two categories.
<b>Rava said: And</b> with regard to <b>all of</b> the primary categories in the mishna, <b>when you cast</b> the primary category of <b>Pit among them, all</b> of the rest <b>of them can</b> then <b>be derived through</b> an analogy based on <b>the common factor</b> of two categories. This is the case with all of the categories <b>except for Goring, due to</b> the fact <b>that there is</b> room <b>to refute</b> the analogy to teach the <i>halakha</i> of Goring with the following contention: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about all of</b> the other categories? They are notable <b>in that they are forewarned from their outset.</b> Since it is the typical manner of the animal to trample and eat, and the typical manner of fire to burn, and the typical manner of a pit to serve as an obstacle, the owner is always forewarned with regard to safeguarding against damage and is liable to pay full damages for his failure to prevent the damage even the first time. With regard to Goring, the animal is innocuous for the first three instances of damage and only thereafter is the animal forewarned, rendering its owner liable to pay full damages.
<b>And according to the one who says: On the contrary, Goring is superior</b> in the sense that one’s liability in a case of Goring is more apparent, <b>as the objective of</b> the ox’s action <b>is to cause damage, even Goring</b> can <b>be derived</b> from the common factor of two sources.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if all the categories can be derived from another category and Pit, <b>for</b> the purpose of deriving <b>what <i>halakha</i> did the Merciful One write</b> all the primary categories explicitly? The Gemara answers: It is in order <b>to</b> derive <b>their</b> unique <b><i>halakhot</i></b> that apply exclusively to each category.
<b>Goring</b> is written explicitly in order <b>to distinguish between</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of damage caused by <b>an innocuous</b> animal <b>and</b> damage caused by <b>a forewarned</b> animal.
<b>Eating and Trampling</b> are written explicitly in order <b>to exempt</b> from liability those whose animals perform the actions in these categories <b>in a public domain.</b>
<b>Pit</b> is written explicitly in order <b>to exempt</b> one from liability <b>for</b> damage to <b>vessels</b> caused when they fall into a pit. The Gemara adds: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who deems one liable</b> even <b>for damage to vessels</b> caused when they fall <b>into a pit,</b> Pit was written in order <b>to exempt</b> one from liability <b>for</b> the death of <b>a person</b> who was killed by falling into a pit. Rabbi Yehuda concedes that the possessor of the pit is exempt because the person who ultimately fell into the pit was capable of avoiding it.
<b>Man</b> is written explicitly in order <b>to render him liable for four</b> additional <b>types</b> of indemnity, beyond the payment of damages for the diminution in value caused when one injures a person.
<b>Fire</b> is written explicitly in order <b>to exempt</b> one from liability for damage caused to <b>a concealed</b> object, e.g., one hidden by grain, that was consumed by fire. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Yehuda, who deems one liable</b> even <b>for damage</b> done to <b>a concealed</b> object damaged by <b>fire, to add what</b> <i>halakha</i> does the Torah mention the category of Fire explicitly?

Daf 6a

The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add</b> cases where the fire <b>scorched</b> another’s <b>plowed field and</b> cases in which <b>it singed his stones.</b> Even though the damaged object remains intact and is not consumed by the fire, one is still liable to pay for the damage caused.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>The common denominator of</b> the components in all these categories is that it is their typical manner to cause damage. The Gemara asks: In order <b>to add what</b> <i>halakha</i> is this statement cited in the mishna? <b>Abaye said:</b> The stating of the common denominator in the mishna serves <b>to add</b> that one is liable in a case of <b>his stone, his knife, or his load, where he placed them on top of his roof, and they fell</b> off the roof <b>by means of a common wind and caused damage.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which one would be liable for the damage that was caused? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where</b> those items <b>cause damage as they are moving</b> through the air propelled by the wind, <b>that is</b> a subcategory of <b>Fire.</b>
Therefore, one could claim: If so, <b>what is different</b> about <b>Fire</b> that defines it as a unique category? It is <b>that another force is involved with it</b> in causing damage, as it is the wind that causes the fire to spread and cause damage; <b>and</b> the entity propelled by the wind is <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b> In <b>these</b> cases, <b>too, another force is involved with them</b> in causing damage; <b>and</b> the objects are <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>their safeguarding,</b> to prevent them from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b> Perforce, there is no need for the common denominator in the mishna to teach the case of an object that causes damage when propelled off a roof by the wind. That case is included in the primary category of Fire that is explicitly mentioned in the mishna.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps the common denominator serves to teach the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable when <b>after</b> those objects fall from the roof <b>they come to rest</b> on the ground, and they cause damage as an obstacle on which a person or an animal stumbles. The mishna teaches that the one who placed them on the roof is liable. The Gemara questions this explanation: What are the circumstances in which one is liable? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where one declared them ownerless, both according to Rav and according to Shmuel, this is</b> a subcategory of <b>Pit.</b>
Therefore, one could claim: <b>What is different</b> about <b>Pit</b> that defines it as a unique category? It is <b>that its initial formation,</b> i.e., the digging of the pit, <b>is</b> done in a manner that can <b>result in damage, and</b> it is <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage to others, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b> With regard to <b>these</b> items he had placed on the roof, <b>too, their initial formation,</b> i.e., when they are placed in the public domain, <b>is</b> done in a manner that can <b>result in damage, and</b> they are <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>their safeguarding,</b> to prevent them from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b> Perforce, there is no need for the common denominator in the mishna to teach the case where the objects fell from the roof, came to rest in the public domain, and were declared ownerless. That case is included in the primary category of Pit that is explicitly mentioned in the mishna.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps the common denominator serves to teach the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable even in a case <b>where one did not declare them ownerless.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>According to Shmuel, who says: We learned</b> that one is liable to pay for damage caused by <b>all</b> obstacles that one places in a public domain, whether or not he declares them ownerless, <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <b>one’s pit; this is</b> a subcategory of <b>Pit.</b> The question remains: What <i>halakha</i> does the common denominator in the mishna teach?
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna teaches one’s liability in a case <b>where one declared</b> the objects <b>ownerless, and</b> even if he declared them ownerless, those objects <b>are not similar to</b> the primary category of <b>Pit. What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the primary category of <b>Pit?</b> It is notable <b>in that there is no other force involved with it</b> in causing the damage. <b>Will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to these</b> cases, <b>where</b> there is <b>another force involved with it</b> in causing the damage, i.e., the wind that propelled them from the roof to rest on the ground?
The Gemara suggests: If one attempts to challenge the derivation from Pit in this manner, it is possible to respond: The <i>halakha</i> of the primary category of <b>Fire will prove</b> that this factor, that there is another force involved with the object in causing the damage, is not a reason to exempt one from paying restitution for the damage, as although there is another force involved in the spreading of a fire, one is liable for the damage the fire causes, so the <i>halakha</i> with regard to these objects can be derived from that of Fire.
The Gemara questions the derivation from Fire: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about Fire?</b> It is notable <b>in that its</b> typical <b>manner</b> is <b>to proceed</b> from one place to another <b>and</b> cause <b>damage.</b> Will you say the same with regard to these objects propelled by the wind into the public domain, where it is not their typical manner to proceed and cause damage? Accordingly, how can one learn the <i>halakha</i> in this case from that of Fire?
The Gemara suggests: If one attempts to challenge the derivation from Fire in this manner, it is possible to respond: The <i>halakha</i> of the primary category of <b>Pit will prove</b> that the lack of this characteristic, of a typical manner being to proceed and cause damage, is not a reason to exempt the owner of the objects from paying restitution for the damage, as that is the nature of Pit, and one is liable for damage caused by his pit. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> as Pit and Fire each prove that the defining characteristic of the other is not decisive in establishing liability or exemption, <b>the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point, and liability in these cases is derived from the common denominator of Pit and Fire. This is the <i>halakha</i> added by the common denominator stated in the mishna.
<b>Rava said:</b> The stating of the common denominator in the mishna serves <b>to add</b> the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable in a case of <b>Pit where</b> an object <b>is rolled by the feet of a person or the hooves of an animal.</b> This is a case where one placed an obstacle in a public domain and the obstacle caused no damage where it was placed, but subsequently was kicked by passersby to a different location where it caused damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which one is liable for damage in that case? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where one declared</b> the objects <b>ownerless, both according to Rav and according to Shmuel this is</b> a subcategory of <b>Pit.</b>
Therefore, one could claim: <b>What is different</b> about <b>Pit</b> that it is defined as a unique category? It is <b>that its initial formation,</b> i.e., the digging of the pit, <b>is</b> done in a manner that can <b>result in damage, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage to others, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b> With regard to <b>these</b> objects, <b>too, their initial formation,</b> i.e., when the obstacle reaches the in the public domain, <b>is</b> done in a manner that can <b>result in damage, and</b> responsibility for <b>their safeguarding,</b> to prevent them from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b> Perforce, there is no need for the mishna to state their common denominator to teach the <i>halakha</i> in the case where the objects came to rest and are declared ownerless. That case is included in the primary category of Pit that is explicitly mentioned in the mishna.
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps the common denominator serves to teach the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable even in a case <b>where one did not declare</b> the objects <b>ownerless.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>According to Shmuel, who says: We learned</b> that one is liable for damage caused by <b>all</b> obstacles that one places in a public domain, whether or not he declares them ownerless, <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <b>one’s pit, this is</b> a subcategory of <b>Pit.</b> What <i>halakha</i> does the common denominator in the mishna teach?
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna teaches one’s liability in a case <b>where one declared</b> the objects <b>ownerless, and</b> even if he declared them ownerless, those objects <b>are not similar to</b> the primary category of <b>Pit. What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the primary category of <b>Pit?</b> It is notable <b>in that one’s actions,</b> the digging of the pit, <b>cause</b> the damage. <b>Will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to these</b> cases, <b>where one’s actions do not cause</b> damage? Rather, it is the feet of the passersby that caused the damage, by rolling the object to a different location where it caused damage.
The Gemara suggests: If one attempts to challenge the derivation from Pit in this manner, it is possible to respond: The <i>halakha</i> of the primary category of <b>Ox will prove</b> that this fact, that one’s actions do not cause the damage, is not a reason to exempt one from paying restitution for the damage, as although the owner’s actions do not cause the ox to cause damage, one is liable for the damage caused by his ox.
The Gemara questions the derivation from Ox: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about Ox?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> it is the typical <b>manner</b> of the animals in these categories <b>to proceed</b> from one place to another <b>and</b> cause <b>damage.</b> By contrast, in the case of the obstacle kicked by passersby to a different location where it caused damage, it is not its typical manner to proceed and cause damage. Accordingly, how can one learn the <i>halakha</i> in this case from the primary category of Ox? The Gemara suggests: The primary category of <b>Pit will prove</b> that this fact, that the typical manner of a category’s components is not to proceed and cause damage, is not a reason to exempt one from paying restitution for the damage, as that is the nature of Pit, and one is liable for damage caused by his pit.
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> as Pit and Ox each proves that the defining characteristic of the other is not decisive in establishing one’s liability or exemption, <b>the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point, which is that the defining <b>characteristic</b> of <b>this</b> primary category of Ox <b>is not similar to</b> the defining <b>characteristic</b> of <b>that</b> category of Pit, and liability in these cases is derived from the common denominator of Pit and Ox. This is the <i>halakha</i> added by the common denominator stated in the mishna.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> The stating of the common denominator in the mishna serves <b>to add</b> the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable to pay damages in <b>this</b> case <b>that is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all those</b> people <b>who</b> engage in activities that the Sages <b>stated</b> are permitted, i.e., those who <b>open their gutters</b> and drain the sewage from their houses into the public domain, <b>and</b> those who <b>flush out</b> the water from <b>their caves,</b> where foul-smelling water was stored, into the public domain, <b>during the summer they do not have permission</b> to do so, while <b>during the rainy season they have permission</b> to do so, since the street is rained upon in any event and thereby washed. And <b>although</b> all these people perform their actions <b>with permission, if they cause damage they are liable to pay</b> for it.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which one is liable for damage caused by the sewage? <b>If</b> the sewage <b>causes damage as it is moving,</b> after he poured it into the public domain, <b>it is</b> damage caused by <b>his</b> own direct <b>action,</b> and it is no different from any other damage caused by a person. According to Rav, it is under the rubric of <i>Maveh</i> in the mishna. According Shmuel it appears in the next mishna, and it is not derived from the common denominator mentioned in the mishna.
<b>Rather,</b> it is in a case where the damage was caused <b>after</b> the sewage <b>came to rest</b> on the floor, e.g., a passerby slipped on it. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> it is a case <b>where one declared</b> the sewage <b>ownerless, both according to Rav and according to Shmuel, this is</b> a subcategory of <b>Pit. What is different</b> about <b>Pit</b> that it is defined as a unique category? It is <b>that its initial formation,</b> i.e., the digging of the pit, <b>is</b> done in a manner that can <b>result in damage, and</b> it is <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage to others, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b> With regard to <b>this</b> sewage, <b>too, its initial formation,</b> i.e., the placement of the sewage in the public domain, <b>is</b> done in a manner that can <b>result in damage, and</b> it is <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> perhaps the common denominator serves to teach the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable even in a case <b>where he did not declare</b> the sewage <b>ownerless.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>According to Shmuel, who says: We learned</b> that one is liable for damage caused by <b>all</b> obstacles that one places in a public domain, whether or not he declares them ownerless, <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <b>one’s pit, this is</b> a subcategory of <b>Pit.</b> The question remains: What <i>halakha</i> does the common denominator in the mishna teach?
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna teaches one’s liability in a case <b>where he declared</b> the sewage <b>ownerless, and</b> even if he declared it ownerless, it <b>is not similar to</b> the primary category of <b>Pit. What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the primary category of <b>Pit?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> the pit was dug in the public domain <b>without permission. Will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to these</b> cases <b>where</b> the sewage was channeled into the public domain <b>with permission?</b>

Daf 6b

The Gemara suggests: The primary category of <b>Ox will prove</b> that this fact, that the ox, i.e., the cause of the damage, entered the public domain with permission, is not a reason to exempt its owner from payment, as that is the nature of the primary category of Ox, and one is liable for damage caused by his ox.
The Gemara questions the derivation from Ox: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about Ox?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> it is the typical <b>manner</b> of the animals in these categories <b>to proceed</b> from one place to another <b>and</b> cause <b>damage.</b> By contrast, in the case of the sewage, it is not its typical manner to proceed and cause damage. Accordingly, how can one learn the <i>halakha</i> in this case from the primary category of Ox?
The Gemara suggests: If one attempts to challenge the derivation from Ox in this manner, it is possible to respond: The <i>halakha</i> of the primary category of <b>Pit will prove</b> that the lack of this characteristic, of the typical manner being to proceed and cause damage, is not a reason to exempt one from paying restitution for the damage, as that is the nature of Pit, and one is liable for damage caused by his pit. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> as Pit and Ox each prove that the defining characteristic of the other is not decisive in establishing liability or exemption, <b>the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point, and liability in these cases is derived from the common denominator of Pit and Ox. This is the <i>halakha</i> added by the common denominator stated in the mishna.
<b>Ravina said:</b> The stating of the common denominator in the mishna serves <b>to add</b> the <i>halakha</i> that one is liable to pay damages in <b>this</b> case <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna (117b): In the case of <b>a wall or a tree that fell</b> on its own <b>into the public domain and caused damage,</b> the owner of the wall or tree is <b>exempt from paying</b> damages because he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control. But if the court had sensed the potential danger and had <b>allotted him</b> a certain amount of <b>time</b> during which he was obligated <b>to chop down the tree or to demolish the wall,</b> and he had not yet done so, <b>and</b> the wall or tree <b>fell</b> into the public domain <b>within the</b> allotted <b>time and caused damage,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying damages. If he did not do so and it fell <b>after the</b> allotted <b>time</b> expired, he is <b>liable</b> to pay the damages.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> it is a case <b>where one declared</b> the fallen tree or wall <b>ownerless, both according to Rav and according to Shmuel, this is</b> a subcategory of <b>Pit. What is different</b> about the primary category of <b>Pit</b> that it is defined as a unique category? What is different is <b>that its damage is commonplace, and</b> it <b>is your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>its safeguarding,</b> to prevent it from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b> In <b>these</b> cases involving the tree and the wall, <b>too, their damage is commonplace, and</b> they are <b>your property, and</b> responsibility for <b>their safeguarding,</b> to prevent them from causing damage, is incumbent <b>upon you.</b>
<b>If</b> it is a case <b>where one did not declare them ownerless, according to Shmuel, who says: We learned</b> that one is liable for damage caused by <b>all</b> obstacles that he places in the public domain whether or not he declares them ownerless, <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> with regard to <b>one’s pit, this is</b> a subcategory of <b>Pit.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna teaches one’s liability in a case <b>where one declared</b> the tree or wall <b>ownerless, and</b> even if he declared them ownerless, they <b>are not similar to</b> the primary category of <b>Pit. What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the primary category of <b>Pit?</b> It is notable <b>in that its initial formation,</b> i.e., the digging of the pit, <b>is</b> done in a manner that can <b>result in damage. Will you say</b> the same <b>with regard to these</b> cases, <b>where their initial formation,</b> i.e., the planting of the tree and the building of the wall, <b>is not</b> done in a manner that can <b>result in damage?</b>
The Gemara suggests: The primary category of <b>Ox will prove</b> that this factor, of not being initially formed in a manner that can result in damage, is not a reason to exempt its owner from payment, as that is the nature of the primary category of Ox, i.e., an ox is not born in a manner that results in damage, and one is liable for damage caused by his ox.
The Gemara questions the derivation from Ox: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about Ox?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> it is the typical <b>manner</b> of the animals in these categories <b>to proceed</b> from one place to another <b>and</b> cause <b>damage.</b> By contrast, in the case of the tree and wall, it is not their typical manner to proceed and cause damage. Accordingly, how can one learn the <i>halakha</i> in these cases from the primary category of Ox?
The Gemara suggests: If one attempts to challenge the derivation from Ox in this manner, it is possible to respond: The <i>halakha</i> of the primary category of <b>Pit will prove</b> that the lack of this characteristic, of the typical manner being to proceed and cause damage, is not a reason to exempt one from paying restitution for the damage, as that is the nature of Pit, and one is liable for damage caused by his pit. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> as Pit and Ox each prove that the defining characteristic of the other is not decisive in establishing liability or exemption, <b>the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point, and liability in the cases of the tree and the wall is derived from the common denominator of Pit and Ox. This is the <i>halakha</i> added by the common denominator stated in the mishna.
§ The mishna states: And <b>when</b> a component of any of these categories <b>causes damage, the</b> owner or generator of the component that <b>caused damage is obligated [<i>ḥav</i>]</b> to pay restitution with best-quality land. The Gemara asks: Why does the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna use the unusual expression: <b>The one liable for the damage is <i>ḥav</i></b> to pay? He should have used the more standard expression for liability: <b>The one liable for the damage is <i>ḥayyav</i></b> to pay. The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: This <i>tanna</i> is a Jerusalemite, who teaches</b> using <b>a light</b> and concise <b>formulation,</b> as <i>ḥav</i> is more concise than <i>ḥayyav</i>.
§ The mishna continues: The owner or generator of the component that caused damage is obligated <b>to pay</b> restitution for damage with best-quality land. The one liable for the damage is indebted <b>to pay payments</b> of restitution <b>for damage</b> with his superior-quality land. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to paying damages: <b>“Of the best of his field, and of the best of his vineyard he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4). What is the meaning of “his field” and “his vineyard”? It refers to that property of the injured party; the one liable for the damage pays from land of a quality that is commensurate to <b>the best</b>-quality <b>field of</b> the <b>injured</b> party <b>and</b> to <b>the best</b>-quality <b>vineyard of</b> the <b>injured</b> party, even if the property he damaged was of a lesser quality; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that <b>the verse comes only to</b> allow <b>injured</b> parties <b>to collect</b> compensation <b>from superior-quality</b> land belonging to the one liable for the damage, in the event that he has no money or movable property. <b>And</b> by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference one can derive that the Temple treasury of <b>consecrated</b> property collects from superior-quality land.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> if one’s animal <b>ate</b> from <b>a rich</b> garden bed, it is understandable that he <b>must pay</b> the injured party the value of <b>a rich</b> garden bed. But if it <b>ate</b> from <b>a poor</b> garden bed, is it reasonable that he <b>pays</b> the value of <b>a rich</b> garden bed? While this is the straightforward meaning of his statement, it is untenable, as he would be paying more than the value of the damage he caused.
<b>Rav Idi bar Avin said: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the animal that caused the damage <b>ate</b> from one <b>garden bed among</b> other <b>garden beds, and we do not know whether it ate</b> from <b>a poor</b> one <b>or it ate</b> from <b>a rich</b> one. In such a case, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> the animal’s owner <b>pays</b> the injured party the value of <b>a rich</b> one.
<b>Rava</b> raised a question and <b>said: And if we would know that</b> the animal <b>ate</b> from <b>a poor</b> garden bed, its owner would have to <b>pay only</b> the value of <b>a poor</b> garden bed. <b>Now that we do not know whether</b> it <b>ate</b> from <b>a poor</b> garden bed or <b>if</b> it <b>ate</b> from <b>a rich</b> garden bed, is it reasonable that he should have to <b>pay</b> the value of <b>a rich</b> garden bed? There is a general principle governing monetary disputes that <b>the burden of proof falls on the claimant.</b> Therefore, so long as the injured party cannot prove that the animal ate from the rich garden bed, he should not be entitled to collect the value of such a garden bed.
<b>Rather, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where,</b> after appraising the damage, the court comes to collect from the one liable for the damage, but he does not have money available to pay for the damage. And the <i>tanna’im</i> disagree in a case where <b>the superior-quality</b> land <b>[<i>iddit</i>],</b> i.e., the best land, <b>of the injured</b> party <b>is equal</b> in quality <b>to the inferior-quality</b> land <b>of the one liable for the damage,</b> and the one liable for the damage also has land of superior quality.
<b>And they disagree with regard to this: Rabbi Yishmael holds: We appraise</b> the value of the land <b>of the injured</b> party, and therefore the one liable for the damage can pay with his inferior-quality fields, which are equal in quality to the best fields owned by the injured party. <b>And Rabbi Akiva holds: We appraise</b> the value of the land <b>of the one liable for the damage</b> and have him pay with his fields of superior quality.
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason of Rabbi Yishmael?</b> The word <b>“field” is stated below,</b> toward the end of the verse: “Of the best of his field, and of the best of his vineyard he shall pay” (Exodus 22:4). <b>And</b> the word <b>“field” is</b> also <b>stated above,</b> at the beginning of that same verse: “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and he sends forth his animal, and it consumed in the field of another.” <b>Just as</b> the <b>field which is stated above</b> belongs to <b>the injured</b> party, <b>so too the field stated below</b> belongs to <b>the injured</b> party.
<b>And Rabbi Akiva</b> holds: When the verse says: <b>“Of the best of his field and of the best of his vineyard he shall pay,”</b> it means from the best <b>of</b> the one <b>who is paying,</b> i.e., from the best fields belonging to the one liable for the damage.
<b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> respond to this? The <b>verbal analogy</b> between the two instances of the word “field” <b>is effective, and</b> the straightforward meaning of <b>the verse</b> itself <b>is effective. The verbal analogy is effective, as I stated.</b> It serves to teach that when it says that he pays from the best of his field, it means from land equal in quality to the best field owned by the injured party.
And the straightforward meaning of <b>the verse</b> itself <b>is effective,</b> as it serves to teach a different <i>halakha</i>, in a case <b>where the one liable for the damage has superior-quality</b> land <b>and inferior-quality</b> land<b>, and the injured</b> party <b>has inferior-quality</b> land<b>, and the inferior-quality</b> land <b>of the one liable for the damage is not as good as the superior-quality</b> land <b>of the injured</b> party. In this case, the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> the one liable for the damage <b>pays</b> the injured party <b>from his best</b> land, i.e., from the superior-quality land that he owns.
This is <b>as</b> the one liable for the damage <b>is</b> legally <b>unable to say to him: You</b> should <b>come</b> and <b>collect from</b> my <b>inferior-quality</b> land. He cannot say this because the standard for classifying land as being of superior-quality is set according to the injured party’s superior-quality land, and the inferior-quality land of the one liable for the damage is of a lower quality than that. <b>Rather,</b> the injured party <b>collects</b> his damages <b>from</b> the <b>best</b>-quality land of the one liable for the damage.
§ The <i>baraita</i> cited above teaches: <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that <b>the verse comes only to</b> allow <b>injured</b> parties <b>to collect</b> compensation <b>from superior-quality</b> land belonging to the one liable for the damage, in the event that he has no money or movable property. <b>And</b> by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference one can derive that the Temple treasury of <b>consecrated</b> property collects from superior-quality land. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference from ordinary damage <b>to</b> damage involving the <b>consecrated</b> property? To which case does this refer?
<b>If we say</b> that <b>our ox,</b> i.e., an ox belonging to a Jew, <b>gored an ox that is consecrated</b> property, there is a difficulty, as <b>the Merciful One states:</b> “And if one man’s ox hurts the <b>ox of another”</b> (Exodus 21:35). This teaches that the <i>halakha</i> applies only if the ox hurt an ox belonging to another Jew, <b>but not</b> if it hurt <b>an ox that is consecrated</b> property. In the latter case no damages are collected.
<b>Rather,</b> we say that the <i>a fortiori</i> inference is referring not to a case of damage but <b>to one who</b> vows and <b>says: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to donate <b>one hundred dinars for Temple maintenance.</b> And the inference teaches that if the one who took the vow has no money, then the Temple <b>treasurer comes and collects</b> the hundred dinars <b>from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> land.
The Gemara challenges this understanding: The Temple treasurer <b>should not</b> be treated any better than an ordinary <b>creditor,</b>

Daf 7a

<b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a creditor</b> is to collect only <b>from intermediate-quality</b> land, not from superior-quality land.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>a creditor</b> can <b>collect</b> the money owed him <b>from superior-quality</b> land <b>as well,</b> there is still a difficulty; the <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>can</b> still <b>be refuted</b> in the following manner: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> an ordinary <b>creditor?</b> He is notable <b>in that</b> the Torah <b>enhanced his power with regard to payment of damages,</b> as an ordinary person can collect payment of damages for loss or injury caused by another’s ox. But <b>can you say</b> the same about the Temple treasury of <b>consecrated</b> property, with regard to which the Torah <b>weakened its power with regard to payment of damages,</b> not allowing it to collect such compensation? Accordingly, even if a creditor collects from superior-quality land, it does not necessarily follow that a Temple treasurer would also do so. It is therefore apparent that Rabbi Akiva’s <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not referring to the case of one who donates money to the Temple.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Actually,</b> we can explain that we are dealing here with a case <b>where our ox gored an ox that is consecrated</b> property. <b>And</b> with regard to that <b>which</b> posed <b>a difficulty for you</b> about this explanation, i.e., that <b>the Merciful One states: “</b>The <b>ox of another”</b> (Exodus 21:35), which indicates that liability is incurred only for damaging another person’s ox <b>but not</b> for <b>an ox consecrated</b> to the Temple, <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> disagrees with that interpretation and <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says:</b> If <b>an ox that is consecrated</b> property <b>gored an ox belonging to a common person [<i>hedyot</i>],</b> the Temple treasury is <b>exempt</b> from liability. By contrast, in the case of <b>an ox belonging to a common person that gored an ox that is consecrated</b> property, <b>whether</b> the ox that gored the other ox was <b>an innocuous</b> ox, i.e., an ox with no consistent history of causing damage with the intent to injure, <b>or</b> it was <b>a forewarned</b> ox, i.e., an ox whose owner was forewarned because his ox had already gored another ox three times, the ox’s owner <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, from where</b> do you know to say that Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yishmael <b>disagree about</b> a case where <b>the superior-quality</b> land belonging to <b>the injured</b> party <b>and the inferior-quality</b> land belonging to <b>the one liable for the damage</b> are equal in quality, and the one liable for the damage also has land of superior quality, as the dispute was previously interpreted by Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov? <b>Perhaps everyone,</b> including Rabbi Akiva, <b>agrees</b> that <b>we appraise</b> the value of the land <b>of the injured</b> party, <b>and here they disagree with regard to</b> the <b>dispute between Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya and the Rabbis.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Akiva holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya,</b> that in the case of damage caused by the ox of a common person to the property of the Temple treasury, compensation is collected from superior-quality land belonging to the one liable for the damage. <b>And Rabbi Yishmael holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that the owner of the ox bears no liability. In other words, perhaps in the <i>baraita</i> recording the dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva (see 6b), Rabbi Yishmael first taught that land is appraised based on the quality of the injured party’s land, and then, although it is not explicit in the <i>baraita</i>, he continued to state his opinion that the Temple treasury is unable to collect damages. Accordingly, Rabbi Akiva can be understood as having first expressed his agreement concerning the valuation of land and then proceeding to dispute Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion with regard to the Temple treasury.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>If it is so</b> that this is the disagreement, then <b>what</b> is the meaning of Rabbi Akiva’s statement: <b>The verse comes only</b> to allow injured parties to collect compensation from superior-quality land? This indicates that Rabbi Akiva disagrees about how to understand this verse.
<b>And furthermore,</b> if the subject is the Temple treasury, <b>what</b> is the meaning of: <b>And</b> by means of <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference one can derive that the Temple treasury of <b>consecrated</b> property collects from superior-quality land. If, as suggested, Rabbi Akiva holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya, then he maintains that damage to consecrated property is dealt with more stringently than damage to another person’s property, in that if one’s ox damages consecrated property one is liable for the full cost of the damage even if the ox was considered innocuous. If damage to consecrated property is dealt with more stringently, there is no basis to derive an <i>a fortiori</i> inference.
<b>And furthermore, didn’t Rav Ashi say:</b> It is <b>taught explicitly</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“The best of his field and the best of his vineyard he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4), teaches that the appraisal is of <b>the best of the field of the injured</b> party, <b>and</b> of <b>the best of the vineyard of the injured</b> party. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The appraisal is of <b>the best of the field of the one liable for the damage, and</b> of <b>the best of the vineyard of the one liable for the damage.</b> This clearly indicates that according to Rabbi Akiva compensation is collected from the superior-quality land belonging to the one liable for the damage.
§ The Gemara considers others issues concerning the form in which restitution should be paid: <b>Abaye raises a contradiction</b> and addresses it <b>to Rava: It is written: “The best of his field and of the best of his vineyard he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4), which indicates that from his <b>best</b>-quality land, <b>yes,</b> he shall pay, but from <b>something else, no,</b> he shall not pay.
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or a donkey fall therein, the owner of the pit shall pay; <b>he shall recompense</b> money to its owners” (Exodus 21:33–34)? Since the verse states: “The owner of the pit shall pay,” the additional term “he shall recompense” is superfluous. It therefore serves <b>to include</b> any item <b>worth money, and even bran,</b> a relatively inferior commodity, as valid forms of restitution.
Rava resolves the contradiction: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the term “he shall recompense” is referring to a case where he pays <b>of his own volition,</b> without being taken to court, and he may therefore use any form of payment. <b>There,</b> the phrase “of the best of his field” is referring to a case where he pays <b>against his will,</b> after the injured party has sued him in court. Since he caused the injured party additional trouble, he must pay using his best-quality land.
<b>Ulla, son of Rav Ilai, said:</b> According to this explanation, the language of the verse <b>is also precise, as it is written: “He shall pay,”</b> a term that, as opposed to: “He shall recompense,” connotes that he is forced to pay <b>against his will.</b>
<b>Abaye said to him</b> that the precise meaning of the verse does not indicate that he is paying against his will: <b>Is it written: He shall be paid,</b> in the passive form, which would clearly indicate that he did not voluntarily initiate the payment himself but rather is paying against his will? No; <b>“he shall pay” is written,</b> which can also <b>indicate</b> that he pays <b>of his own volition.</b>
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> an alternative resolution, <b>similar to that</b> with which the <b>Master,</b> i.e., Abaye’s teacher, Rabba, employed in order to resolve a different difficulty. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A wealthy person is not entitled to take a poor man’s tithe. He is instead expected to sell his assets and purchase food with the proceeds. But in the case of an individual <b>who owns houses, fields, and vineyards, but</b> at the present time <b>cannot find</b> buyers <b>to</b> whom he can <b>sell them,</b> one <b>may feed him</b> with food from the <b>poor man’s tithe up until half</b> the value of his assets.
<b>And</b> the Master <b>discussed it</b> and asked: <b>What are the circumstances</b> that led to him being unable to sell his land? <b>If everyone’s land depreciated</b> in value, <b>and his</b> land <b>also depreciated along with theirs, let us provide him</b> with <b>even more</b> than half the value of his assets, <b>as,</b> since <b>everyone’s land also depreciated,</b> the market value of his property is low and he is genuinely classified as a poor person, who may take as much poor man’s tithe as is given to him.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be <b>that everyone</b> else’s <b>land appreciated</b> in value, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>his land, since</b> people see <b>that he goes in and goes out for money,</b> i.e., he is in need of money, they reason that he will be forced to accept a lower offer for his property. Consequently, <b>his land depreciated</b> in value.

Daf 7b

The Gemara asks: But if that is the case, <b>we should not provide him with even a slight</b> amount of poor man’s tithe. Since his assets, based on their market value, have a high value, he is not to be classified as a poor person.
<b>And the Master,</b> Rabba, <b>said concerning this: No,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that he is provided with only up to half the value of his assets is <b>necessary</b> in a case where he cannot sell due to seasonal fluctuations in price. This is <b>because in the days</b> of the month <b>of Nisan,</b> which is the beginning of the harvest season, the market value of <b>land appreciates, and in the days</b> of the month <b>of Tishrei,</b> a time when the harvest had already been reaped and it is too late to prepare the land for the coming year, the market value of <b>land depreciates.</b>
Consequently, <b>everyone</b> generally <b>waits until Nisan and sells</b> only at that point. <b>But this</b> person, <b>since he is in need of money, sells</b> his land in Tishrei <b>according to the current,</b> lower, market price. Accordingly, based on the current market prices, his assets have a low value and there is justification in regarding him as a poor person. Yet, since if he waited until Nisan, as everyone else does, his land would have a high value, he cannot truly be classified as a poor person. Therefore, he is permitted to take only as much poor man’s tithe as will cover his losses. The Gemara explains why he is permitted to take only up to half the value of his land: Since <b>it is the nature of</b> land <b>to depreciate up to half</b> its value, and it is <b>not its nature to depreciate more</b> than that, he is entitled to take poor man’s tithe that is worth up to half the value of his land and the rest he can supplement by selling his land at its current, lower price.
Abaye uses a similar distinction to resolve the contradiction he raises: <b>And here also, with regard to damages,</b> if one considers a case where the injured party comes to collect his damages during Tishrei, <b>his legal right</b> is to collect payment <b>from superior-quality</b> land. This will be a relatively large amount of land, owing to the current seasonal depreciation in its value.
<b>But if</b> the injured party <b>says to</b> the one liable for the damage: <b>Give me slightly more land of intermediate quality</b> instead, then the one liable for the damage <b>can say to him: If you</b> choose to <b>take</b> superior-quality land, <b>as is your legal right, take</b> a large amount <b>in accordance with the current</b> market value; <b>but if not,</b> and you wish to take intermediate-quality land, <b>take according to the future</b> value in Nisan, after it will have <b>appreciated,</b> which will mean you will be entitled to a smaller amount of land. This can be used to resolve the contradiction: The phrase “of the best of his field,” which indicates that payment is made only from superior-quality land, defines the injured party’s basic rights. The term “he shall recompense,” which indicates that payment may be made in any form, is referring to a case where the injured party forgoes his rights. In such a case the value of the land or item he agrees to receive is appraised based on its appreciated value at the season when it is generally sold.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov objects to this</b> suggestion: <b>If so, you have weakened the power of injured</b> parties <b>with regard to intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land, as, by agreeing to receive land of a lower quality than that to which their rights entitle them, they will actually receive less land, since the land is then appraised based on the appreciated market values in Nisan. Such an opinion is untenable, <b>as the Merciful One states</b> that injured parties collect <b>from the best</b>-quality land, clearly intending to enhance their rights, <b>and</b> yet <b>you said</b> he <b>cannot also</b> collect <b>from intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land unless he agrees that the land should be appraised based on the appreciated Nisan values, thereby lowering the value of his payment.
<b>Rather, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: If there is</b> a case <b>to compare to</b> Rabba’s distinction, it is not compared to a case of payment of damages, but <b>we can compare it to</b> a case of <b>a creditor</b> who comes to collect the loan during Tishrei. <b>His legal right is</b> to collect <b>from</b> the borrower’s <b>intermediate-quality</b> land, which will be a relatively large amount owing to the current seasonal depreciation in the value of land. <b>But if</b> the creditor <b>says to</b> the borrower: <b>Give me slightly more land of inferior quality</b> instead, the borrower <b>can say to him: If you</b> choose to <b>take</b> the intermediate-quality land, <b>as is your legal right, take</b> a large amount <b>in accordance with the current</b> market value, <b>but if not,</b> and you wish to take land of inferior quality, <b>take</b> it <b>in accordance with the future, appreciated,</b> market value in the month of Nisan. This would mean that the creditor would be entitled to a smaller amount of land.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, objects to this</b> suggestion: <b>If so, you have locked the door in the face of</b> potential <b>borrowers, as,</b> according to your suggestion, the creditor is in a disadvantageous position. <b>He can say to</b> the borrower: <b>Were I</b> still <b>to have</b> the <b>money</b> I lent you, <b>I would</b> be able to <b>purchase</b> a large parcel of land <b>in accordance with the current</b> depreciated market value, so why, <b>now that the money is with you, should I</b> be forced to <b>purchase</b> land <b>in accordance with the future, appreciated</b> market value of the month of Nisan? If people are penalized as a result of granting loans, they will cease to do so.
<b>Rather, Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: If there is</b> a case <b>to compare to</b> Rabba’s distinction, <b>we can compare it to</b> the collection of <b>a woman’s marriage contract</b> where she comes to collect it during Tishrei. <b>As a woman’s legal right</b> in <b>a marriage contract</b> is to collect payment <b>from</b> her husband’s <b>inferior-quality</b> land, which will be a relatively large amount owing to the current seasonal depreciation in the value of land. <b>But if she says to</b> her former husband: <b>Give me slightly less land of intermediate quality</b> instead, her former husband <b>can say to her: If you</b> choose to <b>take</b> the lowest-quality land, <b>as is your legal right, take</b> a large amount <b>in accordance with the current</b> market value, <b>but if not,</b> and you wish to take land of a higher quality, <b>take in accordance with the future appreciated</b> market value of the month of Nisan, which will mean you will be entitled only to a smaller amount of land.
The Gemara returns to examine the contradiction raised by Abaye: <b>In any case,</b> the original <b>difficulty</b> still remains.
<b>Rava said: Whatever he gives</b> the injured party as payment <b>he must give him of the best</b> of that type. For example, even if he pays in bran he must pay with his best-quality bran, and this is the meaning of the phrase “of the best of his field.” Accordingly, the contra-diction is resolved. The term “he shall recompense” indicates that payment can be given in any form, but the phrase “of the best of his field” indicates only that whichever form of payment is used, it must be of a superior quality, and not, as Abaye initially understood it, as limiting the form of payment specifically to land of superior quality.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t “the best of his field” written,</b> which suggests that the requirement to pay with one’s best land applies only when one pays with land?
<b>Rather, when Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, came from Rav’s academy, they explained it</b> as follows: With regard to payment, <b>all items are</b> classified as property of the <b>best</b> quality, <b>as, if</b> an item <b>cannot be sold here, it can be sold in another city.</b> Since movable items are easily liquidated, they are always considered an acceptable form of payment. This is <b>with the exception of land,</b> which is not always easily sold. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> is that the one liable for the damage <b>must give</b> the injured party payment <b>from his best</b>-quality land, which is easier to sell. This is <b>in order</b> to ensure the possibility <b>that a buyer will jump at</b> the opportunity to purchase <b>it,</b> thereby providing the injured party with the possibility of liquidating it. This resolves the contradiction. The phrase “of the best of his field” indicates that if payment is made with land it must be with superior-quality land, and the term “he shall recompense” indicates that if payment is made from movable property, anything worth money may be used.
§ <b>Rav Shmuel bar Abba from Akronya asked Rabbi Abba: When</b> the court <b>appraises</b> land to determine if it is to be classified as being of superior-quality, does <b>it appraise</b> land <b>based on</b> the quality of a property owner’s other land <b>or</b> does <b>it appraise</b> it <b>based on</b> the quality of the land in <b>the world</b> at large?
The Gemara notes: <b>Do not raise the dilemma in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, as he says</b> that <b>we appraise</b> land <b>based on</b> the quality of land owned by the <b>injured</b> party, and therefore payment is made with land that is of a similar quality to the best-quality land of the injured party. Accordingly, it is obvious that the classification is based only on the land of the injured party.
<b>When you raise this dilemma,</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>we appraise</b> land <b>based on</b> the quality of land owned by <b>the one liable for the damage,</b> and he pays with his superior-quality land even if its quality exceeds that of any of the injured party’s land. Consequently, according to Rabbi Akiva it is appropriate to ask whether the appraisal is based only on his other land or based on the land in the world at large.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the answer to the dilemma? When <b>the Merciful One states: “The best of his field”</b> (Exodus 22:4), does the stress in the verse on “his field” serve <b>to exclude</b> only the possibility of appraising land based solely on the value of the land <b>of the injured</b> party, but land is appraised based on the quality of land in the world at large? <b>Or perhaps,</b> does it serve <b>to exclude</b> the possibility of appraising land based on the quality of land <b>of the world</b> at large <b>as well,</b> and it is sufficient if the land he pays with is his best-quality land?
Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: The Merciful One states: “The best of his field,” and you say</b> the court <b>appraises</b> land <b>based on</b> the quality of land in <b>the world</b> at large? Certainly the term “his field” teaches that it is sufficient that the land be the best of the land of the one liable for the damage.
Rav Shmuel bar Abba <b>raised an objection to</b> this opinion from a <i>baraita</i> that delineates the forms of payment used for paying damages, repaying a debt to a creditor, and paying a marriage contract: If the debtor <b>has only superior-quality</b> land, <b>all of them collect from the superior-quality</b> land. Similarly, if <b>he has only intermediate-quality</b> land, <b>all of them collect from</b> the <b>intermediate-quality</b> land. And if <b>he has only inferior-quality</b> land, <b>all of them collect from</b> the <b>inferior-quality</b> land.
If <b>he has superior-quality, intermediate-quality, and inferior-quality</b> land, <b>damages</b> are paid <b>from</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land, <b>and a creditor</b> collects <b>from</b> the <b>intermediate-quality</b> land, <b>and a woman’s marriage contract</b> is paid <b>from</b> the <b>inferior-quality</b> land. If he has only <b>superior-quality and intermediate-quality</b> land, <b>damages</b> are paid <b>from</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land, and payment to <b>a creditor and</b> payment of <b>a woman’s marriage contract</b> are made <b>from</b> the <b>intermediate-quality</b> land. If he has only <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land, payments for <b>damages and</b> payments owed to <b>a creditor</b> are made <b>from</b> the <b>intermediate-quality</b> land, while payments of <b>a woman’s marriage contract</b> are made <b>from</b> the <b>inferior-quality</b> land.

Daf 8a

If he has only <b>superior-quality and inferior-quality</b> land, <b>damages</b> are paid <b>from</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land, <b>and</b> pay-ments owed to <b>a creditor and</b> payments of <b>a woman’s marriage contract</b> are made <b>from</b> the <b>inferior-quality</b> land.
The Gemara explains how this <i>baraita</i> poses a challenge: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> in the <b>middle clause:</b> If he owns only <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land, payments for <b>damages and</b> payments owed to <b>a creditor</b> are made <b>from</b> the <b>intermediate-quality</b> land, <b>and</b> payments of <b>a woman’s marriage contract</b> are made <b>from</b> the <b>inferior-quality</b> land. This clause demonstrates that the quality of land is appraised objectively based on the standard of the world at large. The reason for this is that <b>if you say</b> that the court <b>appraises</b> land <b>based on</b> the quality of the land of the one liable for the damage, <b>let his intermediate-quality</b> land <b>be classified as superior-quality</b> land, as that is the best land he owns, <b>and</b> consequently, the <b>creditor should be directed to</b> collect the debt from the <b>inferior-quality</b> land.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where</b> at the time the borrower took the loan <b>he</b> also <b>had superior-quality</b> land <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>sold it.</b> Accordingly, no matter how land is appraised, at the time that the loan was given his intermediate-quality land would be classified as being of intermediate quality. Consequently, the creditor’s lien on the borrower’s land, which took effect from the moment the loan was given, takes effect with regard to the intermediate-quality land. Therefore, the creditor retains his right to collect from that land, regardless of the fact that by the time of collec-tion it was the borrower’s best land and at that point could be reclassified as land of superior quality.
<b>And so says Rav Ḥisda:</b> The <i>baraita</i> deals with a case <b>where</b> at the time he took the loan <b>he</b> also <b>had superior-quality</b> land <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>sold it.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>This too stands to reason, from</b> the fact <b>that another</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches:</b> If a debtor has only <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land, <b>damages</b> are collected <b>from</b> the <b>intermediate-quality</b> land, while payments to <b>a creditor and</b> payments of <b>a woman’s marriage contract</b> are made from the <b>inferior-quality</b> land. These two <i>baraitot</i> <b>are difficult,</b> as they contradict <b>each other.</b> The <i>baraita</i> above teaches that in this case the creditor collects the debt from the intermediate-quality land, whereas this <i>baraita</i> teaches that he collects the debt from the inferior-quality land.
<b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from it</b> that <b>here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> above, it is a case where <b>he</b> also <b>had superior-quality</b> land at the time that he took the loan <b>and</b> he subsequently <b>sold it,</b> while <b>there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> subsequently cited, it is a case where <b>he did not have superior-quality</b> land <b>and</b> he did not <b>sell it.</b> In such a case, since his intermediate-quality land was his best land, it is classified as superior-quality land and accordingly, no lien took effect with regard to it.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the contradiction between the <i>baraitot</i> can be resolved differently: Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> concern cases where the borrower <b>did not have superior-quality</b> land <b>and sell it. And</b> it <b>is not difficult</b> because <b>this</b> second <i>baraita</i> concerns a case where <b>his intermediate-quality</b> land <b>is equivalent</b> in quality <b>to the superior-quality</b> land <b>of the world</b> at large; therefore, it is classified as superior-quality land and the creditor has no right to collect from it. <b>And here,</b> the first <i>baraita</i> concerns a case in <b>which his intermediate-quality</b> land <b>is not equivalent</b> in quality <b>to the superior-quality</b> land <b>of the world at large</b> but is similar to the intermediate-quality land of the world at large; consequently, the creditor has a claim to it.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> concern a case <b>where</b> the borrower’s <b>intermediate-quality</b> land, which is the best land he owns, <b>is equivalent</b> in quality <b>to the intermediate-quality</b> land <b>of the world</b> at large, <b>and here,</b> the <i>baraitot</i> <b>disagree about this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that the court <b>appraises</b> the debtor’s land <b>based on</b> the quality of <b>his</b> other land, so that his best land is classified as superior-quality land and the creditor has no claim on it. And the other <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that the court <b>appraises</b> the debtor’s land <b>based on</b> the quality of land in <b>the world</b> at large, so that his land is classified as intermediate-quality land and the creditor is entitled to claim it.
<b>Ravina said:</b> Another resolution to the contradiction between the <i>baraitot</i> is that the <i>baraitot</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the opinion of <b>Ulla, as Ulla says: By Torah law, a creditor</b> collects <b>from inferior-quality</b> land, <b>as it is stated: “You shall stand outside, and the man you have a claim against will bring his collateral out to you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:11). One can infer: <b>What</b> item would <b>a person typically</b> choose <b>to bring out</b> for use as collateral and potential payment? Certainly it is the <b>most inferior of his utensils.</b> The verse thereby indicates that a creditor collects from inferior-quality land. <b>But</b> if so, for <b>what reason</b> did the Sages <b>say</b> that <b>a creditor</b> collects <b>from intermediate-quality</b> land? They instituted this ordinance <b>so as not to lock the door in the face of</b> potential <b>borrowers,</b> as, if creditors were limited to collecting from inferior-quality land they would be hesitant to offer loans in the first place.
Ravina explains: One <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the <b>ordinance</b> cited <b>by Ulla</b> that a creditor collects from intermediate-quality land. <b>And</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>is not of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the <b>ordinance</b> cited <b>by Ulla,</b> so the creditor has a right to collect from only inferior-quality land, in accordance with Torah law.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Ketubot</i> 12:3): If one owes money to pay damages, repay a loan, and pay a woman’s marriage contract, and he owns inferior-quality, intermediate-quality, and superior-quality land, and he sells all of his land, then if he <b>sold</b> all of the land <b>to one</b> person <b>or to three people simultaneously, all</b> the buyers <b>replace the</b> land’s prior <b>owner</b> with regard to repayment of his debts. At the time when each debt was created, each creditor gained a lien on the plots of the debtor’s land, from which they have a right to collect. As a lien remains in effect even if the land is sold, then even after the sale, each creditor can collect from the plots of land upon which they have a lien. Accordingly, damages are collected from the superior-quality land, the loan is repaid from the intermediate-quality land, and the marriage contract is paid from the inferior-quality land.
If he sold his plots of land <b>one after the other, all</b> the creditors <b>collect from the last</b> buyer, regardless of the quality of the land he purchased. If that buyer <b>does not have</b> sufficient land purchased from the debtor to pay all the debts, the creditors take the land he has and <b>collect</b> the remaining sums <b>from</b> the one <b>who</b> purchased land <b>before him,</b> and if he also <b>does not have</b> sufficient land, they <b>collect</b> the rest <b>from</b> the one <b>before</b> the one <b>before him,</b> i.e., the first buyer. The Sages instituted that creditors may not collect from land that a debtor sold, even though it is technically still liened to them, as long as the debtor still has sufficient means with which to repay the debt (see <i>Gittin</i> 48b). Accordingly, after the sale of the first plot of land, the creditors’ rights to collect are restricted to the land that remains in the possession of the debtor, and consequently they gain a lien on it, irrespective of its quality. Therefore, even if that land is subsequently sold, their rights to collect are restricted to that land, and only if the value of that land is insufficient to cover the cost of the debt may they utilize the original liens they had on the plots of land that were sold first.
The Gemara clarifies: With regard to the first case in the <i>baraita</i>, where he <b>sold</b> all the land <b>to one</b> person, <b>what are the circum-stances?</b>
<b>If we say</b> that he <b>simultaneously</b> sold all of the land to one person, that is difficult. <b>Now</b> that the <i>baraita</i> teaches that if he sold the land <b>to three</b> different people simultaneously, <b>where it is possible to say</b> that the sale to <b>one of them preceded</b> the other sales, yet <b>you say</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>all</b> the buyers <b>replace the</b> land’s prior <b>owner</b> equally, and the possibility that one might have proceeded the other is disregarded, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that the <i>halakha</i> is the same in a case where all the plots of land were simultaneously <b>sold to one</b> person?
<b>Rather,</b> it <b>is obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the plots of land were sold <b>one after the other.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But what is different</b> about the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>, where the plots of land were sold to <b>three</b> buyers, one after the other, and the creditors collect only from the last buyer? It is different in <b>that each one</b> of the first two buyers <b>can say to</b> any creditor who tries to seize the land they purchased: Do not collect my land, as <b>I left a place for you,</b> a plot of land in the debtor’s possession, <b>from which to collect.</b> In other words, when the first two buyers purchased their land a plot of land remained with the debtor, and therefore the creditor’s rights of collection are restricted to that land.
The Gemara continues its question: In <b>this</b> case <b>as well,</b> where all the plots of land were sold to a single buyer, <b>with regard to each one</b> of the first two plots of land that were sold, <b>let</b> the buyer <b>say to</b> any creditor who tries to collect: With my purchase of the first two plots of land, <b>I left a place for you,</b> a plot of land in the debtor’s possession, <b>from which to collect.</b> Therefore, even though the debtor subsequently sold the buyer all of the land, the creditor’s rights of collection are restricted to the last plot of land the debtor sold the buyer, irrespective of its quality. Why then does the <i>baraita</i> rule that in this case each creditor collects from the land that was originally liened to him?
The Gemara explains: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where</b> the individual buyer <b>purchased</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land <b>last.</b> Accordingly, the buyer is satisfied with allowing each creditor to collect from the land that was previously liened to him, rather than having them each collect from the superior-quality land. <b>And so says Rav Sheshet:</b> It is a case <b>where</b> the individual buyer <b>purchased</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land <b>last.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, let them all come and collect from</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land, as their rights to collect should be restricted to it, since it was purchased last.
The Gemara answers: <b>Because he can say</b> the following threat <b>to them: If you are silent</b> and do not insist on collecting from the superior-quality land, <b>and take</b> the land of a quality that is due to you <b>according to your</b> standard <b>legal rights,</b> as in a case where you collect directly from the debtor, i.e., the injured party will collect from the superior-quality land, the creditor from the intermediate-quality land, and the woman will collect her marriage contract from the inferior-quality land, then <b>take</b> that land and I will allow you to do so. <b>But if not,</b> and you insist on taking the superior-quality land that I purchased last, then <b>I will return the bill</b> of sale <b>of the inferior-quality</b> land <b>to its</b> prior <b>owner,</b> i.e., the debtor, <b>and you will all</b> be forced to collect <b>from</b> the <b>inferior-quality</b> land, because whenever the debtor has land in his possession you are able to collect the debts only from him.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that this is the reason for the ruling in the <i>baraita</i>,

Daf 8b

then <b>also with regard to damages, let</b> the buyer <b>say this</b> to the injured party. He could threaten to return the bill of sale of the inferior-quality land to the debtor, which would force the injured party to collect directly from the debtor’s inferior-quality land. Since the buyer can do so, he can effectively force the injured party to collect from the purchased intermediate-quality land instead of fulfilling his right to collect from superior-quality land. Yet, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that in this case each party collects from the land that was originally liened to him, which means that damages are collected from the superior-quality land, indicating that this threat would not be effective.
<b>Rather, with what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with</b> a case in which the debtor died and his inheritors are his <b>orphans, who are not subject to</b> an obligation to <b>repay</b> the debts of their father. When one dies, his monetary debts are not inherited by his children. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>the lien of</b> the creditor <b>rests</b> solely <b>upon the buyer</b> of the land. Any lien that was in effect with regard to the land he owned at the time he incurred the obligation remains, and his creditors can therefore collect what they are owed from that land, even if it is in the possession of a buyer.
<b>Therefore, one cannot say</b> that the ruling in the <i>baraita</i> is based on the fact that the buyer can threaten to return the bill of sale to the debtor, or in this case, to his orphans. In this case, even if he were to return the bill of sale, the creditors would not be able to collect from the land now in the orphans’ possession, as they received it anew, not as an inheritance from their father. Therefore, the creditors can still collect from the plots of land that remain with the buyer.
The Gemara suggests another explanation of the <i>Tosefta</i>: <b>Rather,</b> not all the creditors collect from the superior-quality land, which was the last plot of land purchased from the debtor, <b>because</b> the buyer <b>can say to them: What is the reason</b> that <b>the Sages said one is not paid from liened</b> property, i.e., property liened to a creditor that has been sold by the debtor, <b>whenever there is unsold</b> property still in the debtor’s possession? It is <b>due to an ordinance</b> created solely <b>for my</b> benefit, as I should not be expected to pay from the land I purchased when the debtor is still able to pay. If that ordinance were to be in effect in this case, all of their liens would be in effect with regard to the superior-quality land, as that was purchased last. In this case <b>I do not</b> find <b>this ordinance satisfactory to me,</b> and I would prefer for the lien of each creditor to remain in effect with regard to the land it had been on initially, and I will give each of you that land.
The Gemara notes: This fact that one is not required to avail himself of the financial benefit provided by a rabbinic ordinance <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava. As Rava says: Anyone who says: I do not want</b> to avail myself <b>of</b> the financial benefit provided by <b>an ordinance of the Sages, such as this</b> one, <b>one listens to him.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does Rava mean by saying: An ordinance of the Sages, <b>such as this</b> one?
The Gemara answers: His statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna. As Rav Huna says:</b> The Sages enacted that a husband must sustain his wife. They also enacted that he receives her earnings in exchange. Yet, <b>a wife is</b> legally <b>entitled to say to her husband: I will not be sustained</b> by you, <b>and</b> in turn <b>I will not work</b> i.e., you will not keep my earnings. Since his obligation to sustain her is only for her benefit, she may forgo her sustenance and retain her earnings for herself.
The Gemara discusses a limitation on the buyer’s ability to refuse the benefit of the rabbinic ordinance: <b>It is obvious</b> that if the <b>buyer sold,</b> of the land he purchased from the debtor, the <b>intermediate- and inferior-quality</b> land to another buyer <b>and retained in his possession</b> only the <b>superior-quality</b> land, which he had purchased last, <b>then all</b> the creditors <b>may come and collect from</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land.
<b>For</b> if the intermediate-quality and inferior quality land were in his possession, <b>he would be able to say to</b> the creditors: <b>Collect from</b> the <b>intermediate-quality</b> land and from the <b>inferior-quality</b> land, as <b>it is not satisfactory to me</b> to avail myself of the <b>ordinance of the Sages</b>. Now the he has sold the land of intermediate and inferior quality, however, he cannot unilaterally waive the ordinance without the consent of the second buyer. The second buyer benefits from the ordinance, since it compels the creditors to collect from the first buyer, and he will therefore certainly not agree to waive it.
<b>But if</b> the first buyer <b>sold</b> only the <b>superior-quality</b> land that he had purchased last, <b>and</b> he <b>retained</b> in his possession the <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?
<b>Abaye thought to say: All</b> the creditors <b>should come</b> and <b>collect from</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land. Since that land was the last plot of land in the debtor’s possession, the creditors’ right of collection was restricted to that land, irrespective of the fact that it was then subsequently sold twice.
<b>Rava said to him: What has the first</b> person <b>sold to the second</b> in any sale? <b>Any rights that will come into his possession. And since, if</b> the creditors <b>were to come to</b> the <b>first buyer</b> while he was still in possession of all three plots of land, <b>he could have had them collect from</b> the <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land; <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though when he</b> initially <b>purchased</b> the <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land the <b>superior-quality</b> land <b>was</b> still <b>unsold</b> property in the debtor’s possession. As although there is the rabbinic ordinance that <b>one does not exact payment from liened property when there is unsold</b> property still in the debtor’s possession, the buyer <b>could have said to them: I do not</b> find <b>this ordinance satisfactory to me.</b>
Rava continues: Therefore, since the first buyer had the right to say this, the <b>second buyer can also say to them: Collect</b> from the <b>intermediate-quality and inferior-quality</b> land in the first buyer’s possession. <b>As, when the second buyer purchased</b> the superior-quality land, <b>he purchased</b> it <b>with the understanding that he</b> also acquired <b>all the rights that the first</b> buyer <b>had with regard to</b> that land. Accordingly, he also acquires the right to insist that the creditors collect from the intermediate-quality and inferior-quality land.
In a related ruling, <b>Rava says:</b> In the case of <b>Reuven, who sold all of his fields to Shimon</b> simultaneously <b>and Shimon proceeded to sell one field</b> of those purchased <b>to Levi, and Reuven’s creditor came</b> to collect the debt, if the creditor so <b>desires, he collects from this</b> one, i.e., Shimon, and if <b>he</b> so <b>desires, he collects from that</b> one, i.e., Levi. <b>And we said this only</b> in a case <b>where</b> Levi <b>purchased intermediate-quality</b> land from Shimon. A creditor’s right is to collect the debt from intermediate-quality land. Accordingly, in this case, Reuven’s creditor can collect his loan from the intermediate-quality land even after it has been transferred into Levi’s possession. Nevertheless, if he so desires, he may insist on collecting his loan from any inferior-quality land left in Shimon’s possession. This is because a creditor also has the right to demand payment from a borrower’s inferior-quality land instead of his intermediate-quality land, and therefore that land is also liened to the loan.
<b>But</b> if Levi <b>purchased superior-quality and inferior-quality</b> land from Shimon, <b>no,</b> the creditor can collect only from Shimon’s intermediate-quality land, <b>as</b> Levi could <b>say to him: For this</b> reason <b>I was particular to purchase superior-quality and inferior-quality</b> land, which is <b>land that is not fit for you</b> to collect from as a creditor.
<b>And if</b> Levi <b>purchased</b> the <b>intermediate-quality</b> land from Shimon <b>as well, we said</b> that Reuven’s creditor can collect from him <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he did not leave</b> some <b>similar intermediate-quality</b> land in Shimon’s possession, <b>as</b> in that case, Levi <b>is unable to say to</b> the creditor: <b>I left a place for you,</b> i.e., a plot of land, <b>in Shimon’s possession,</b> from which to collect. <b>But</b> where Levi <b>did leave</b> some <b>similar intermediate-quality</b> land <b>in Shimon’s possession,</b> the creditor <b>does not collect from</b> Levi, <b>as</b> Levi <b>is able to say to him: I left a place for you from which to collect.</b>
In another related ruling, <b>Abaye says:</b> In the case of <b>Reuven, who sold a field</b> liened to his creditor <b>to Shimon with a guarantee,</b> meaning that Reuven agreed to reimburse Shimon should Reuven’s creditor collect the debt from that field, <b>and Reuven’s creditor came and seized</b> the field <b>from Shimon, the <i>halakha</i> is that Reuven</b> can <b>go and litigate with</b> his creditor and claim that he had already repaid the debt, and insist that the field be returned to Shimon. <b>And</b> the creditor <b>is unable to say to</b> Reuven: <b>I am not legally answerable to you,</b> as I am not taking away your land, since you sold it to Shimon. This is <b>because</b> Reuven could <b>say to him: If you extract</b> the field <b>from him,</b> Shimon <b>will return to me</b> and demand that I reimburse him for his loss. Consequently, I am involved in this matter.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say: Even</b> in a case <b>where</b> he sold the field <b>without a guarantee, as well,</b> in which case even if the creditor seizes Shimon’s land there are no legal consequences for Reuven, Reuven can litigate with the creditor, <b>as</b> he could <b>say to him: It is not satisfactory for me for Shimon to have a grievance against me</b> because he lost the field I sold him on account of the fact that I was unable to pay my debt. Consequently, I am involved in this matter.
<b>And</b> in another related ruling, <b>Abaye says:</b> In the case of <b>Reuven, who sold a field to Shimon without a guarantee,</b>

Daf 9a

<b>and claimants [<i>asikin</i>] come forth about</b> the ownership of the land, disputing Reuven’s prior ownership, <b>as long as</b> Shimon <b>has not yet taken possession</b> of the land, <b>he can retract</b> his agreement to the transaction and is not required to pay for the land. <b>Once he has taken possession</b> of the land, <b>he cannot retract</b> his agreement to the transaction.
<b>What is the reason</b> that he cannot retract his agreement to the transaction once he has taken possession? <b>As</b> Reuven <b>says to him:</b> The purchase of the land was like purchasing <b>a tied bag [<i>ḥayta</i>]</b> whose contents are unknown and might not have any value. Since <b>you were aware</b> of <b>and accepted</b> that possibility, as you purchased it without a guarantee, you cannot retract your agreement.
The Gemara asks: <b>From when is it</b> considered that he has <b>taken possession</b> of the property? He takes possession <b>from</b> the time <b>that he walks upon the boundaries</b> of the land to inspect it.
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this is referring <b>specifically</b> to a case where the field was sold <b>without a guarantee. But</b> where it was sold <b>with a guarantee</b> this is <b>not</b> so, and Shimon can retract his agreement and refuse to pay for the land even after taking possession of it. The reason is that if the claimants succeed with their claims and seize the land, Reuven will then have to return the sum Shimon paid for it. In order to minimize judicial proceedings, the court allows Shimon to claim that there is no point in paying Reuven now only to have his money returned to him later. Therefore, he can retract his agreement to the transaction.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>even</b> where the field was sold <b>with a guarantee,</b> Shimon is unable to retract his agreement to the transaction, <b>as</b> Reuven has the legal right to <b>say to him:</b> First <b>show me the claim authorization document,</b> which a court provides to a buyer when the land he purchased is seized from him by a third party who proved that he had a lien on the land, <b>and</b> only then <b>I will pay you.</b> Consequently, Shimon cannot claim that there is no point in paying Reuven now, after he agreed to the sale but before a third party seized the land, as even if the land will be seized it does not automatically follow that Reuven will have to reimburse Shimon.
§ The Gemara returns to its earlier discussion concerning the form of the payment of damages: <b>Rav Huna says:</b> Damages are paid <b>either</b> with <b>money or</b> with one’s best-quality land.
<b>Rav Naḥman raised an objection to Rav Huna</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“He shall recompense</b> money to its owner” (Exodus 21:34), which serves <b>to include</b> items <b>worth money, even bran,</b> a relatively inferior commodity, as valid forms of payment.
Rav Huna replied: <b>With what are we dealing here</b> in the <i>baraita</i>? We are dealing with a case <b>where he does not have</b> any money or land. The Gemara asks: <b>If he does not have</b> any other means with which to pay, isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that he can pay using what he has? The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>we</b> would <b>say to him: Go</b> to the <b>trouble</b> of <b>selling</b> whatever commodity you own, <b>and</b> thereby <b>bring him money</b> as payment for the damage, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that it is unnecessary to sell one’s possessions and pay with money.
<b>Rav Asi says: Money is equivalent to land.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> are they equivalent? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>with regard to</b> fulfilling the requirement of paying with one’s best-quality land, meaning that he can choose to pay with money instead, <b>this is</b> precisely the ruling <b>of Rav Huna;</b> and yet the ruling of Rav Asi is presented as an independent ruling.
<b>Rather,</b> Rav Asi is referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>two brothers who divided</b> their inheritance, <b>and one took land and</b> the other <b>one</b> took <b>money, and</b> subsequently their father’s <b>creditor came and took</b> the <b>land,</b> as it was liened to his loan. Rav Asi’s ruling teaches <b>that this</b> brother whose land was taken can <b>go and take a half</b> share <b>of the money together with</b> his brother.
The Gemara rejects this explanation: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> Is <b>this</b> one <b>a son and that</b> one <b>not a son?</b> Since they are both sons and equally inherited the estate of their father, they share responsibility for their father’s debts. If the creditor takes repayment of the debt from one brother, the other one must reimburse him.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the Gemara rejects this explanation not because it is obvious, but <b>on the contrary,</b> because it is incorrect. As, one could look at it <b>from the opposite direction,</b> saying <b>that</b> one brother <b>could say to</b> the other: It was <b>with this</b> understanding that <b>I took the money, that if it would be stolen</b> from me <b>I would not be reimbursed from your</b> land, <b>and</b> it was <b>with this</b> understanding that <b>you took the land, that if it would be seized</b> from you by a creditor <b>you would not be reimbursed from my</b> money.
<b>Rather,</b> Rav Asi is referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>two brothers who divided</b> the land they inherited from their father, <b>and</b> their father’s <b>creditor came and took</b> the <b>portion of one of them.</b> Since the brothers carry joint responsibility for their father’s debt, the one whose portion was seized has a right to be reimbursed by his brother. Rav Asi’s ruling teaches that this may be done either by redistributing the remaining portion of land or by reimbursing him with money.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rav Asi</b> already explicitly <b>say that</b> ruling <b>once before?</b> Therefore, this cannot be the explanation of this ruling. <b>As it was stated:</b> In a case of <b>brothers who divided</b> the land they inherited from their father, <b>and</b> their father’s <b>creditor came and took</b> the <b>portion of one of them, Rav says</b> that the initial <b>division</b> of the land is <b>voided</b> and any remaining land is divided equally between the brothers. <b>Shmuel says</b> that each brother, upon taking his portion, <b>relinquished [<i>viter</i>]</b> any rights to be reimbursed if his portion were lost. <b>And Rav Asi says</b> that the brother whose portion was seized has a right to receive half of the remaining inheritance: <b>He takes a quarter in land, and</b> he takes the other <b>quarter in money.</b>
The Gemara explains the rationale behind each opinion: <b>Rav says</b> that the initial <b>division</b> of the land is <b>voided.</b> This is because <b>he holds</b> that <b>brothers who divided</b> their inheritance <b>are</b> considered to still be <b>similar to heirs</b> with respect to the inheritance, and therefore they continue to share joint responsibility for their father’s debts. Consequently, any remaining land is divided equally between the brothers.
<b>And Shmuel says</b> that each brother, upon taking his portion, <b>relinquished</b> any rights to be reimbursed if his portion were lost, as <b>he holds</b> that <b>brothers who divided</b> their inheritance are considered to be like <b>buyers</b> of their respective portions, <b>and</b> each one is considered to be <b>similar to a buyer</b> who bought his portion <b>without a guarantee</b> that would have provided him with a right to be reimbursed if his portion were seized by a creditor.
<b>And Rav Asi says</b> that the brother whose portion was seized has the right to receive half the remaining inheritance. <b>He takes a quarter in land and</b> he takes the other <b>quarter in money.</b> This is because <b>he is uncertain</b> as to <b>whether they are similar to heirs,</b> in which case the remaining land should be redistributed between them, or <b>whether they are similar to buyers</b> who bought their portions with a guarantee, in which case the brother whose portion was taken should be reimbursed by his brother with a sum of money equal to the value of the land that was seized from him. <b>Therefore, he takes a quarter in land and</b> he takes the other <b>quarter in money.</b>
As Rav Asi had already stated the <i>halakha</i> of brothers who divided their inheritance, the Gemara suggests another explanation of his statement. <b>Rather,</b> with regard to <b>what</b> did Rav Asi state that money <b>is equivalent to land?</b> He stated it <b>with regard to</b> the requirement of paying with one’s best-quality land, and is teaching that one may choose to pay with money instead of land.
The Gemara repeats its original rejection of this suggestion: <b>If so,</b> then <b>this is</b> precisely the ruling <b>of Rav Huna,</b> and yet Rav Asi is presented as an independent ruling. The Gemara resolves the problem: Emend the statement and <b>say: And similarly, Rav Asi said.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says: For</b> the purchase of an object with which to fulfill <b>a mitzva,</b> one should spend <b>up to one-third.</b>
The Gemara asks: To <b>what</b> does this <b>one-third</b> refer?

Daf 9b

<b>If we say</b> it means that one should spend up to <b>one-third of his estate</b> to perform a mitzva, <b>but if that is so,</b> and <b>if it happened to him</b> that he became obligated in <b>three mitzvot</b> at the same time, <b>should he give his entire estate</b> away in order to fulfill those mitzvot? One is certainly not required to do so.
<b>Rather,</b> what <b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> is that <b>for</b> the <b>embellishment</b> of the performance <b>of a mitzva,</b> e.g., to purchase a more beautiful item used in the performance of a mitzva, one should spend <b>up to one-third</b> more than the cost <b>of</b> the standard item used to perform <b>the mitzva.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> How is this one-third calculated? Is it <b>one-third from within,</b> i.e., he calculates the cost of a standard item, adds one-third of that value, and spends the total on purchasing a more beautiful item; <b>or</b> is it <b>one-third from without,</b> i.e., one-third of the sum he ultimately spends should be the additional sum added in order to purchase a more beautiful item? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say in the name of Rabbi Zeira:</b> Of the money one spends on purchasing a more beautiful item to perform a mitzva, <b>up to one-third</b> more than the cost of a standard item comes <b>from his own</b> finances, but <b>from this</b> point <b>forward,</b> any additional sum spent on purchasing a more beautiful item comes <b>from</b> the largesse of <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> i.e., God will reimburse him for spending that additional sum.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>anything</b> for <b>which I became responsible for safeguarding it</b> to prevent it from causing damage, if it in fact causes damage, it is considered as if <b>I</b> actively <b>facilitated that damage,</b> and accordingly I must pay for it. In any case in which <b>I facilitated part of the damage it</b> caused, <b>I am liable for payments</b> of restitution <b>for damage it</b> caused, <b>as</b> if I were the <b>one who facilitated the entire damage it</b> caused.
One is liable only with regard to damage caused to <b>property</b> for <b>which,</b> were he to use it for a non-sacred purpose, he <b>would not be</b> liable <b>for</b> the <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property; with regard to damage caused to <b>property that belongs to members of the covenant,</b> i.e., Jews; and with regard to <b>assigned property,</b> the meaning of which the Gemara will explain.
<b>And</b> one is liable for damage caused <b>in any place except for a domain designated</b> exclusively <b>for</b> the use of <b>the one responsible for the damage.</b>
<b>And</b> one is liable for damage caused in <b>a domain</b> designated for the joint use <b>of the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for the damage.</b>
<b>When</b> an animal or item one is responsible to safeguard <b>causes damage, the one liable for the damage</b> caused by insufficiently safeguarding it <b>is obligated to pay payments</b> of restitution <b>for damage with</b> his best-quality <b>land.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that elucidates the mishna’s ruling: With regard to <b>anything</b> for <b>which I became responsible for safeguarding it</b> to prevent it from causing damage, if it in fact causes damage, it is considered as if <b>I</b> actively <b>facilitated that damage</b> and accordingly must pay for it. <b>How so?</b> In the case of <b>an ox or a pit that one transferred to</b> the care of <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor,</b> whose presumed limited intellectual capacity means they are deemed incapable of sufficiently safeguarding them from causing damage, <b>and</b> the ox or pit <b>caused damage,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that since the owner of the ox or pit did not fulfill his duty to safeguard them, he is <b>liable to pay</b> for the damage, <b>which is not so in</b> a corresponding case where the damage is caused by <b>a fire.</b>
The Gemara elucidates: <b>With what are we dealing? If we say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> deals with <b>a tethered ox or a covered pit,</b> which cannot cause damage in the manner in which the owner left them, then the case <b>in the corresponding</b> situation <b>of fire,</b> where he is not liable, is where one transferred <b>an ember</b> to one of limited halakhic competence, which, had it been left alone, would not have erupted into a fire and caused damage. This cannot be correct, because if so, <b>what is different here</b> in the case of an ox and a pit, where one is liable, <b>and what is different there</b> in the case of the fire, that exempts him from liability? There seems to be no reason to differentiate between them.
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must be dealing with <b>an untethered ox or an exposed pit,</b> which can cause damage in the manner in which the owner left them. If so, then the case <b>in the corresponding</b> situation <b>of fire,</b> where he is not liable, is where one transferred <b>a flame</b> to one of limited halakhic competence, which can also cause damage in this form. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: But if so, why does the <i>baraita</i> state: <b>Which is not so</b> in the case of damage caused <b>by a fire, as one is exempt</b> from paying damages? <b>But</b> this is untenable, as <b>didn’t Reish Lakish say in the name of Ḥizkiyya: They taught</b> that one is exempt from damage caused by a fire <b>only</b> in a case where <b>he transferred an ember to</b> one of limited halakhic competence <b>who</b> then <b>fanned</b> it into a flame. <b>But</b> if he transferred <b>a flame</b> to him, the one who transferred the flame to him <b>is liable</b> for any damage caused. <b>What is the reason?</b> He is responsible <b>because the</b> capacity for it to cause <b>damage is certain.</b>
The Gemara returns to its initial suggestion: <b>Actually,</b> the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to a tethered ox or a covered pit, and</b> the case <b>in the corresponding</b> situation <b>of fire,</b> where he is not liable, is where one transferred <b>an ember</b> to one of limited halakhic competence. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that</b> which <b>you said</b> in order to reject this: <b>What is different here</b> in the case of an ox and a pit that causes him to be liable <b>and what is different there</b> in the case of the fire, that exempts him from liability? Seemingly, in all these cases the item was not able to cause damage in its current form, so he is exempt from liability.
The Gemara explains: You could answer as follows: The typical <b>manner of an ox is to free</b> itself from being tethered and the typical <b>manner of a pit is</b> for its cover <b>to become dislodged.</b> Therefore, as it is negligent to transfer an ox or pit to someone who is incapable of sufficiently safeguarding them, the one who transferred the ox or flame to them is liable. By contrast, with regard to <b>an ember, as long as he leaves it</b> alone <b>it progressively dims,</b> and the only way in which it will cause damage is if someone else actively fans it into a flame; therefore, he is not liable.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says: Even</b> if the <i>halakha</i> is that if <b>one transferred a flame to</b> one of limited halakhic competence he <b>is exempt,</b> it is possible to say that the case <b>in the corresponding</b> situation <b>here</b> in the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to an untethered ox or an exposed pit.</b> The Gemara asks: But if so, <b>what is different here</b> in the case of an ox and a pit that causes him to be liable <b>and what is different there</b> in the case of the fire that exempts him from liability? Seemingly, in all these cases the item that was transferred is capable of causing damage in its current form, so he would be expected to be liable.
The Gemara explains: <b>There,</b> in the case of fire, ultimately <b>the deaf-mute’s handling [<i>tzevata</i>]</b> of the flame <b>causes</b> the damage, as if it were not for him moving the flame no damage would have been caused. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the ox and the pit, <b>the deaf-mute’s handling</b> of them <b>does not cause</b> the damage. Rather, the damage was caused even though they remained in exactly the same dangerous state in which the one who had transferred them to the deaf-mute did so. Therefore, the damage is a result of that person’s negligence, and he is liable.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> There is <b>a stringency that applies to</b> the category of <b>Ox as opposed to</b> the category of <b>Pit,</b> and conversely, there is <b>a stringency that applies to Pit as opposed to Ox.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> elucidates: The <b>stringency that applies to Ox as opposed to Pit</b> is <b>that</b> if <b>the ox</b> kills a Jew, the owner is liable to <b>pay a ransom</b> to the victim’s heirs. <b>And for</b> killing <b>a slave</b> the owner of the ox <b>is liable</b> to pay <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> to the slave’s master. Furthermore, in such a case, once the court hears the evidence and the <b>verdict of</b> the ox <b>is complete</b> and the court rules that the ox must be killed, it is <b>prohibited to derive</b> any <b>benefit</b> from the ox. <b>And</b> from then, it is considered that <b>the</b> typical <b>manner</b> of the ox is <b>to proceed and cause damage.</b> All of <b>this is not so in</b> the case of <b>a pit</b> that caused damage. And the <b>stringency,</b> i.e., the reason to be stringent, <b>that applies to Pit as opposed to Ox</b> is <b>that</b> with regard to <b>the</b> primary category of <b>Pit, its initial formation,</b> e.g., its digging, <b>is</b> done in a manner that can <b>result in damage, and</b> the one responsible for it <b>is</b> considered <b>forewarned from its inception. This is not so with regard to Ox.</b>

Daf 10a

There is <b>a stringency that applies to</b> the category of <b>Ox as op-posed to Fire,</b> and conversely, there is <b>a stringency that applies to Fire as opposed to Ox.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> elucidates: The <b>stringency that applies to the</b> category of <b>Ox as opposed to</b> the category of <b>Fire</b> is <b>that</b> if <b>an ox</b> kills a Jew the owner is liable to <b>pay a ransom, and for</b> killing <b>a slave</b> the owner is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>. Furthermore, in such a case, once the court hears the evidence and the <b>verdict of</b> the ox <b>is complete</b> and the court rules that the ox must be killed, it is <b>prohibited to derive</b> any <b>benefit</b> from the ox. And if <b>one transfers</b> his ox <b>to</b> the care of <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor,</b> and it causes damage, he is <b>liable.</b> All of <b>this is not so with regard to a fire.</b> And the <b>stringency that applies to Fire as opposed to Ox is that</b> the one responsible for <b>the fire is</b> considered <b>forewarned from its inception, which is not so with regard to an ox.</b>
There is <b>a stringency that applies to</b> the category of <b>Fire as opposed to</b> the category of <b>Pit,</b> and conversely, there is <b>a stringency that applies to Pit as opposed to Fire.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> elucidates: The <b>stringency that applies to</b> the category of <b>Pit as opposed to</b> the category of <b>Fire</b> is <b>that its initial formation,</b> e.g., its digging, <b>is</b> done in a manner that can <b>result in damage,</b> and if <b>one transfers it to</b> the care of <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor</b> and it causes damage, one is <b>liable. This is not so with regard to a fire.</b> The <b>stringency that applies to Fire as opposed to Pit</b> is <b>that the</b> typical <b>manner of a fire</b> is <b>to proceed and cause damage. And</b> the one responsible for <b>it is</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard <b>to</b> its <b>consuming both something that is fitting for it and something that is not fitting for it,</b> i.e., both flammable and non-flammable items. <b>This is not so with regard to a pit.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> the <i>baraita</i> also <b>teach</b> the following additional stringency: <b>A stringency that applies to Ox as opposed to Pit</b> is <b>that</b> if <b>the ox</b> damages vessels, the ox’s owner <b>is liable</b> to pay <b>for the vessels, which is not so with regard to a pit,</b> which incurs liability for its owner only for damage it causes to people and to animals but not to vessels.
The Gemara explains: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i> taught? <b>It is</b> taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who deems</b> one <b>liable</b> also <b>for damage</b> caused to <b>vessels by</b> his <b>pit.</b>
The Gemara challenges this: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> try to <b>say</b> and explain accordingly <b>the latter clause,</b> which states: The <b>stringency that applies to Fire as opposed to Pit</b> is <b>that the</b> typical <b>manner of a fire</b> is <b>to proceed and cause damage. And</b> the one responsible for <b>it is</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard <b>to</b> its <b>consuming both something that is fitting for it and something that is not fitting for it. This is not so with regard to a pit.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Something that is fitting for it, what are these?</b> Pieces of <b>wood. Something that is not fitting for it, what are these? Vessels.</b> And yet the <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>This is not so with regard to a pit,</b> which indicates that liability is not incurred for damage done to vessels by one’s pit. The Gemara presents the difficulty: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, didn’t you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> one <b>liable for damage</b> caused <b>to vessels by</b> his <b>pit?</b>
<b>Rather, actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and</b> the additional stringency mentioned is true but was not mentioned because the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> certain cases <b>and omitted</b> others. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> else <b>did he omit</b> that makes it reasonable to assume <b>that he omitted this?</b> As a <i>tanna</i> would never omit just a single case, perforce there must be more. The Gemara explains: He also <b>omitted</b> the case of damage done to <b>a concealed</b> item. Liability is incurred for damage done to a concealed item only when it was caused through a category of damage other than fire. If it is damaged by a fire that one lit, he is exempt.
The Gemara suggests another explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>actually</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> explain that the term: <b>Something that is not fitting for it,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>does not</b> serve <b>to include vessels;</b> with regard to vessels there is no distinction between Fire and Pit. <b>Rather,</b> it serves <b>to include</b> a case where a fire <b>scorched</b> another person’s <b>plowed field or singed [<i>sikhsekha</i>] his stones,</b> which are ways of causing damage that cannot be caused by a pit.
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this</b> suggestion: If so, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> also <b>teach</b> the following additional stringency: <b>A stringency that applies to Ox as opposed to Pit</b> is <b>that in the</b> primary category of <b>Ox one is liable</b> if his ox damages another’s <b>ox</b> that is in the category of <b>disqualified consecrated</b> animals, i.e., an animal set aside to be an offering that was disqualified from use and then redeemed. He is liable despite the fact that even after being redeemed it retains a degree of sanctity. <b>This is not so with regard to</b> damage caused by <b>a pit</b> to a disqualified consecrated animal, as in that case he is not liable for the damage caused.
Rav Ashi explains his objection: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> then <b>since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>omitted that</b> case of damage done to vessels, <b>he also omitted this</b> case of damage done to disqualified consecrated animals. <b>But if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Yehuda, what</b> else <b>did he omit</b> that makes it reasonable to assume <b>that he omitted this?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>He omitted</b> the case of an ox that intentionally <b>trampled on a plowed field of</b> another person in order to cause damage. Since the damage was intentional it is included in the primary category of Goring and so one is liable. This manner of causing damage cannot be done by a pit. The Gemara rejects this: <b>If</b> one claims that the <i>tanna</i> omitted the case of damage done to disqualified consecrated animals only <b>due to</b> the fact that he also omitted the case of an ox that intentionally <b>trampled on a plowed field of</b> another person, that is not a sufficient justification. The latter case <b>is not an</b> additional independent <b>omission, as it is</b> included in that which is <b>taught</b> in that <i>baraita</i>: The stringency that applies to Fire as opposed to Pit is <b>that the</b> typical <b>manner of a fire</b> is <b>to proceed and cause damage.</b> The fact that there is no case in the category of Pit corresponding to an ox that intentionally trampled on a plowed field is addressed by this clause.
§ The mishna states: In any case in which <b>I facilitated part of the damage it</b> caused, I am liable for payments of restitution for damage it caused, as if I were the one who facilitated the entire damage it caused.
<b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that elucidates the mishna’s ruling: In any case in which <b>I facilitated part of the damage it</b> caused, <b>I am liable for payments</b> of restitution <b>for damage it</b> caused, <b>as</b> if I were the <b>one who facilitated the entire damage it</b> caused. <b>How so?</b> In the case of <b>one who digs a pit</b> to a depth of <b>nine</b> handbreadths, <b>and another</b> person <b>comes</b> along <b>and completes</b> the digging <b>to</b> a depth of <b>ten</b> handbreadths, the depth at which a pit, according to <i>halakha</i>, can cause death, only <b>the latter</b> individual is <b>liable</b> for injuries and death caused by the pit. Although the pit was already able to cause injury before the second individual deepened it, since by deepening it he increased its capacity to cause damage, he becomes liable for any damage it causes.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And this is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who digs a pit</b> to a depth of <b>nine</b> handbreadths, <b>and another</b> person <b>comes</b> along <b>and completes</b> the digging <b>to</b> a depth of <b>ten</b> handbreadths, only <b>the latter</b> individual is <b>liable</b> for both injuries and death caused by the pit. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: With regard to death</b> caused by the pit, the responsibility is <b>ascribed to the latter</b> individual. <b>With regard to damage</b> caused by the pit, the responsibility is <b>ascribed to the two of them.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> refers only to a digger’s liability <b>for death</b> caused by a pit, <b>and</b> then the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>unanimous,</b> i.e., it is in accordance with the opinions of both the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the preceding discussion took a slightly different form: The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>Rav Pappa</b> answered and <b>said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> refers only to a digger’s liability <b>for death</b> caused by a pit, <b>and</b> then the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>unanimous.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to</b> the explanation of the <i>baraita</i>, that the mishna is referring only to one specific case: <b>But are there no more</b> cases? <b>But isn’t there</b> the case of one who <b>transferred his ox to five individuals</b> in order for them to safeguard it, <b>and one of them was negligent</b> in his duties <b>and</b> the ox <b>caused damage?</b> Isn’t this individual <b>liable</b> for all the damage? This seems to be an additional example of the principle in the mishna that if one facilitated part of the damage caused, he is liable for pay-ments of restitution for the damage caused, as if he were the one who facilitated the entire damage, so the <i>baraita</i> should have mentioned it.
The Gemara rejects the possibility that the mishna could be referring to this case: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which the negligent watchman bears full liability? <b>If we say that without him</b> the ox <b>would not have been</b> properly <b>safeguarded</b> because the ox was particularly strong and it took all five individuals to safeguard it, it <b>is obvious</b> that the negligent individual is liable for all the damage. The reason is <b>that</b> he alone, through his negligence, <b>caused</b> all the damage, not just part of it. <b>Rather,</b> the case must be <b>where</b> even <b>without him</b> the ox <b>would still have been</b> sufficiently <b>safeguarded.</b> The Gemara asks: But if that is the case, <b>what did he do</b> by not safeguarding it? It was still safeguarded without him, so he should not be liable for even part of the damage. It is apparent, then, that the mishna is not referring to this case.
<b>Rav Sheshet objects to</b> the explanation of the <i>baraita</i>, that the mishna is referring only to one specific case: <b>But isn’t there</b> also the case of a fire that was left unattended by its owner and someone else <b>augmented</b> the fire <b>by</b> adding <b>a bundle</b> of wood to it, thereby increasing the capacity of the fire to cause damage to another’s field? Even though he only increased the fire’s capacity to damage, he is liable for any damage it causes. Seemingly, this is an additional example of the mishna’s principle that if one facilitated part of the damage caused, he is liable for payments of restitution for the damage caused, as if he were one who facilitated the entire damage, so the <i>baraita</i> should have mentioned it.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>What are the circumstances?</b>

Daf 10b

<b>If</b> the fire <b>would not have spread</b> to another person’s field <b>without him</b> adding bundles the fire, it <b>is obvious</b> that he alone is liable for the damage because he alone did everything that led to the damage. <b>Rather,</b> the case must be one where the fire <b>would have spread</b> even <b>without him.</b> The Gemara asks: But if that is the case, <b>what did he do</b> by adding bundles of wood? The fire would have spread without him, so he did not cause even part of the damage. It is apparent, then, that the mishna is not referring to this case.
<b>Rav Pappa objects to</b> the claim of the <i>baraita</i> that the mishna refers only to one specific case: <b>But isn’t there</b> also <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a case in which <b>five</b> people <b>were sitting on one bench [<i>safsal</i>] and it did not break, and</b> then <b>one</b> additional person <b>came and sat upon it and broke it</b> with his added weight, <b>the latter</b> individual is <b>liable</b> for all the damage. <b>And Rav Pappa said</b> by way of clarification that this applies in a case <b>where</b> the last individual to sit down was as heavy as <b>Pappa bar Abba.</b> Since he could have potentially broken it even on his own, he had no right to use it. In this case, even though the weight of the first five individuals was presumably a contributing factor in causing the damage, since the damage was ultimately caused by the additional weight of the last individual, he is liable for all of the damage. Seemingly, this is an additional example of the mishna’s principle, and the <i>baraita</i> should have mentioned it.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say that without him</b> the bench <b>would never have broken</b> under the weight of the first five people, then it <b>is obvious</b> that the last individual is liable for all the damage, as ultimately it was his action alone that caused the damage. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>even without him</b> the bench <b>would have broken</b> under the weight of the first five people, and the last individual sat down just as it was about to break. The Gemara asks: But if that is the case, <b>what did he do,</b> i.e., why should he be liable at all? It is apparent, then, that the mishna is not referring to this case.
The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately, how is the <i>baraita</i></b> cited by Rav Pappa to be <b>explained?</b> As the Gemara explained, the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is understandable only if it is referring to a case where the bench would not have broken without him. But if that is the case, as the Gemara noted, it is obvious and therefore unnecessary to state it.
The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where without him it would have broken in two hours, and now it broke in one hour.</b> The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the last individual alone is liable and not the first five, <b>as they can say to</b> the last individual: <b>Were it not for you, we would have sat a little bit more and</b> then <b>stood up;</b> consequently, the bench would never have broken. Therefore, it was ultimately you who caused the bench to break, and therefore only you are liable.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion, because in that situation the last individual would have a valid counterclaim: <b>But let him say to them: Were it not for you</b> continuing to sit on the bench after I sat down, the bench would not have broken, as <b>under my</b> weight alone <b>it would not have broken.</b> Accordingly, we should share the liability for damaging it.
The Gemara offers a different suggestion: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> instantaneously, <b>as he was leaning upon</b> the other five people, <b>the bench broke.</b>
The Gemara asks: If so, it <b>is obvious</b> that he alone is liable, as his action alone caused the damage, and the other five could not have done anything to prevent it as he was leaning upon them.
The Gemara explains: The ruling is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that when one causes damage with <b>one’s direct force</b> it <b>is not equivalent to</b> a situation where one causes damage with <b>one’s body.</b> If he broke the bench by actually sitting down upon it, his action would be considered a direct act of damage completed with his body and he alone would be liable even though the other peoples’ weight was a contributing factor. In this case, since he broke the bench by merely leaning upon the others sitting there, it is his force that led to the damage, not his body, and one might have thought that since the weight of the others certainly contributed to the breakage they should share liability. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> causing damage with <b>one’s direct force is equivalent to</b> causing damage with <b>one’s body.</b> And it teaches that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that anywhere that</b> one would be liable if <b>his body broke</b> something, one is <b>also</b> liable if <b>his force broke</b> something.
The Gemara continues to consider the possibility that there are additional cases covered by the mishna’s ruling aside from the one listed in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And are there not more</b> cases? <b>But isn’t there</b> also the case of <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>was beaten by ten people with ten sticks, whether</b> they beat him <b>simultaneously or one after the other, and he died, they are all exempt</b> from liability for killing him. <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> Where they beat him <b>sequentially, the last</b> individual to beat him alone <b>is liable, because he hastened his death.</b> In this case, the other individuals contributed to the man’s death, but the last one alone is liable. Why didn’t the <i>baraita</i> also mention this case?
The Gemara explains: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is not speaking of</b> one’s liability to receive <b>the death penalty,</b> only of one’s liability to pay damages.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is not speaking of</b> an issue that is the subject of <b>a dispute.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> it? <b>But didn’t we uphold that</b> the case stated in the <i>baraita</i> concerning a pit is subject to a dispute, and <b>it is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, but of the Rabbis? The Gemara explains: <b>We will interpret</b> the <i>baraita</i> to be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and not</b> to be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, but <b>we will not interpret</b> it to be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira and not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> In other words, although we will interpret the <i>baraita</i> as referring to a case that is subject to a dispute, that applies only if it is in accordance with the majority opinion in that dispute.
§ The mishna teaches: In any case in which I facilitated part of the damage it caused, <b>I am liable for payments</b> of restitution <b>for damage it</b> caused, as if I were the one who facilitated the entire damage. The Gemara notes that the mishna <b>does not teach: I am liable for the damage it</b> caused, <b>rather:</b> I am liable <b>for payments</b> of restitution <b>for damage it</b> caused. The Hebrew terms: Payments of restitution [<i>tashlumim</i>], and: To complete [<i>lehashlim</i>], share the same Hebrew root. This alludes to the <i>halakha</i> that the payment of damages is required only in order to complete the injured party’s compensation, which is already partially accounted for, as the injured party is able to recover his dead animal’s current value by selling its carcass. Accordingly, the one liable for the damage is not required to pay the animal’s prior value; rather, he must pay only the difference in its value from before it was damaged and its current state.
The Gemara notes: <b>We</b> already <b>learned this, as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The mishna uses the term: <b>Payments</b> of restitution <b>for damage,</b> as opposed to simply stating: One is liable for the damage caused, to allude to the <i>halakha</i> that the one who is liable must pay only for the decrease in the value of the animal. This assumes that the injured party is able to recover his animal’s current value by selling the carcass. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches that the owner</b> of the injured animal <b>attends to,</b> i.e., retains ownership of, <b>the animal carcass</b> so that, if he wishes to, he may sell it and keep the proceeds.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rabbi Ami said: As the verse states: “One who strikes an animal shall pay for it [<i>yeshallemenna</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 24:18). <b>Do not read</b> the final word <b><i>yeshallemenna</i>,</b> meaning he shall pay for it; <b>rather,</b> read it as though it were vocalized as <b><i>yashlimenna</i>,</b> meaning he shall complete it, to teach that he shall complete the injured party’s compensation, which is already partially accounted for by the injured party’s right to sell his animal’s carcass.
<b>Rav Kahana said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from here:</b> The verse states with regard to a case where an animal was entrusted with a paid bailee who did not fulfill his duty to safeguard it, and the animal was attacked by a wild beast: <b>“If it be torn in pieces, let him bring a witness, the torn animal he shall not pay”</b> (Exodus 22:12). Rav Kahana expounds the verse to mean that <b>he shall pay</b> only up <b>until</b> the value of the <b>torn animal;</b> but <b>he shall not pay</b> for the <b>torn animal itself.</b> In other words, he pays only the difference in value between the animal before it was injured and its current torn state. If the owner of the injured animal wishes to fully recover his loss he must sell the animal’s carcass and keep the proceeds.
<b>Ḥizkiyya said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is derived <b>from here:</b> The verse states with regard to a person’s ox that fatally gored another ox: “He shall pay an ox for the ox, <b>and the carcass shall be his”</b> (Exodus 21:36), meaning the carcass belongs <b>to the injured</b> party, the owner of the gored animal.
<b>And similarly, the school of Ḥizkiyya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And the carcass shall be his”</b> (Exodus 21:36). The verse means the carcass belongs <b>to the injured</b> party. Do <b>you say</b> it belongs <b>to the injured</b> party? <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>it</b> belongs <b>only to the one liable for the damage?</b> To this suggestion, <b>you should say: It could not have been that.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean by: <b>It could not have been that?</b>
<b>Abaye said: If it enters your mind</b> to say that the <b>animal carcass is</b> the property <b>of the one liable for the damage, let the Merciful One write:</b> “He shall pay <b>an ox for the ox,” and</b> then <b>be silent</b> and state no more. <b>Why do I</b> need the verse to continue: <b>“And the carcass shall be his”? Conclude from it</b> that the carcass belongs <b>to the injured</b> party.
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to have multiple sources for this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as if the Merciful One wrote</b> only: <b>“One who strikes an animal shall pay for it,”</b> I could claim that only in that case does one have to pay for only part of the damage <b>because it is an uncommon</b> occurrence. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a torn animal, which is a common</b> occurrence, <b>I will say</b> that his liability should <b>not</b> be limited to the difference in value between what the animal had been worth and the carcass, but he should pay for the entire value of the injured animal. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to explicitly state the <i>halakha</i> also in that case.
<b>And if</b> the Torah <b>had taught us only</b> the case of <b>a torn animal,</b> I could claim that only in that case does one have to pay for only part of the damage <b>because</b> the damage occurred <b>by itself,</b> i.e., it was not directly caused by the one liable for it. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>one who strikes an animal,</b> who does so <b>by</b> direct <b>action, I will say that</b> his liability should <b>not</b> be limited. Therefore, it is necessary to explicitly state the <i>halakha</i> also in that case.
<b>And if</b> the Torah <b>had taught us only these two</b> cases, I could claim that only in those cases does one have to pay for only part of the damage, <b>this</b> one <b>because</b> it is <b>an uncommon</b> occurrence, <b>and that</b> one <b>because</b> the damage occurred <b>by itself. But</b> in a case where one’s ox gores another’s ox, of which the Torah states: <b>“And the carcass shall be his,” which is a common</b> occurrence, and the damage is considered to have been inflicted <b>by</b> its owner’s direct <b>action,</b> since it was under his guard, <b>I will say</b> his liability should <b>not</b> be limited.
<b>And if</b> the Torah <b>had taught us</b> only the case in the verse <b>“And the carcass shall be his,”</b> I could claim that only in that case does one have to pay for only part of the damage <b>because</b> it is one’s <b>property</b> that <b>causes damage. But here,</b> in the case of one who strikes another’s animal, <b>where one causes damage with</b> one’s own <b>body, I will say</b> his liability should <b>not</b> be limited. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to explicitly state the <i>halakha</i> in each case.
<b>Rav Kahana said to Rav: But</b> according to the statement of Ḥizkiyya, as explained by Abaye, <b>the</b> only <b>reason</b> the injured party retains ownership of the carcass is <b>that the Merciful One wrote: “And the carcass shall be his,”</b> but were <b>it not for that I would say</b> that <b>the carcass is</b> the property <b>of the one liable for the damage.</b>
Rav Kahana questions the need for the Torah to teach this: <b>Now, if</b> the one liable for the damage <b>had</b> in his possession the carcasses of <b>several torn animals, he could give</b> the injured party a carcass as payment, <b>as the Master said</b> above (7a): The verse states: <b>“He shall recompense”</b> (Exodus 21:34), <b>to include</b> items <b>worth money, and even bran,</b> a relatively inferior commodity, as valid items with which to pay restitution. <b>Is it necessary</b> for the Torah to teach that he can pay restitution with <b>his,</b> i.e., the injured party’s, animal carcass? Granting ownership of the carcass to the injured party seems pointless, because even had the Torah granted it to the one liable for the damage, he could give it to the injured party as payment.
The Gemara explains: It <b>is necessary only for</b> the issue of who sustains the loss due to the <b>diminishing</b> value <b>of the carcass</b> between its death and when the case is brought before the court. By granting ownership of the carcass to the injured party from the moment of the animal’s death, the Torah limits the damages to the difference between the value of the animal when it was alive and its value immediately after it is killed, irrespective of what happens to the carcass afterward.
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that the issue of the <b>diminishing</b> value <b>of the carcass is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to a case where an animal was entrusted with a paid bailee and was attacked by a wild beast: <b>“If it be torn in pieces, let him bring a witness [<i>ed</i>]”</b> (Exodus 22:12).

Daf 11a

This means that the bailee <b>should bring witnesses that</b> the animal <b>was mauled through circumstances beyond</b> his <b>control, and</b> based on their testimony he is <b>exempt</b> from liability. <b>Abba Shaul says:</b> The word <i>ed</i> should not be interpreted as witness, but as carcass. Accordingly, the bailee <b>should</b> immediately <b>bring</b> the <b>carcass [<i>aduda</i>] to court</b> in order to appraise its current value.
<b>What, is it not</b> so that <b>they disagree about this</b> matter: <b>That</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Abba Shaul, <b>holds</b> that the loss due to <b>the diminishing</b> value <b>of the carcass is</b> sustained <b>by the injured</b> party, and so there is a need to appraise its value immediately in order to correctly assess how much the one liable for the damage must pay, <b>and</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that the loss due to <b>the diminishing</b> value <b>of the carcass is</b> sustained <b>by the one liable for the damage</b> because the Torah granted him ownership of it.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, everyone</b> agrees that the loss due to <b>the diminishing</b> value <b>of the carcass is</b> sustained <b>by the injured</b> party, since he owns it, <b>and here they disagree concerning</b> who must go to <b>the effort</b> of retrieving the <b>carcass</b> and transporting it to the court to be appraised.
<b>And</b> so <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Others say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that it is</b> incumbent <b>upon the owner of the pit to raise the ox from his pit</b> after it was killed by falling into it? <b>The verse states:</b> “The owner of the pit shall pay; <b>he shall restore money to its owner, and the carcass</b> shall be his” (Exodus 21:34). They read the term “and the carcass” as a second subject of the term “he shall restore.” It therefore indicates that the one liable for the damage must restore the carcass to the injured party by retrieving it. The fact that this opinion is introduced with the phrase: Others say, suggests that it stands in opposition to another opinion. That other opinion apparently holds that the owner of the injured animal is responsible for retrieving the carcass.
<b>Abaye said to Rava: What are the circumstances</b> in which the one liable for the damage is required to go to <b>this effort,</b> to retrieve the <b>carcass</b> from the pit?
<b>If we say that</b> while still <b>inside the pit,</b> the carcass <b>is worth a dinar, and</b> when it is <b>at the edge</b> of the pit, since it is more accessible, its market value increases and <b>is worth four</b> dinars, then <b>when</b> the one liable for the damage <b>expends the effort</b> to retrieve the carcass, he is <b>expending the effort for his own sake,</b> since by increasing the value of the carcass he reduces his own liability. Therefore, he will certainly retrieve it of his own accord, and it is not necessary for the Torah to require him to do so.
Rava <b>said to him: No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to require him to retrieve the carcass in a case <b>where,</b> while still <b>inside the pit</b> the carcass <b>is worth</b> one <b>dinar, and</b> when it is <b>at the edge</b> of the pit, despite being more accessible, it <b>is still worth</b> one <b>dinar.</b> Since it is of no benefit to him to retrieve it, the Torah had to require him to do so.
The Gemara asks: <b>But is there</b> ever <b>a case like this,</b> where despite being more accessible its market value does not change? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as people say, a beam</b> of wood <b>in the city</b> sells <b>for a dinar,</b> and <b>a beam</b> of wood <b>in the field</b> also sells <b>for a dinar,</b> despite the fact that it needs to be transported from there to the city.
§ <b>Shmuel says:</b> The practice of the court is that when an animal or other item is stolen and then is damaged or dies, the court <b>does not appraise</b> its current value and assign ownership of it to its owner, in order that the perpetrator should have to pay only the difference between its prior value and its current value, <b>neither for</b> the sake of <b>a thief nor for</b> the sake of <b>a robber.</b> Rather, the thief or robber acquires ownership of the carcass or damaged item and compensates the owner for its prior value. The court appraises the item or carcass <b>only for damages,</b> as the Gemara explained above. <b>And I say</b> that they appraise the item or animal <b>even for a borrower</b> who borrowed an item and while it was in his possession it became damaged, or who borrowed an animal and while it was in his possession it died, <b>and Abba,</b> i.e., Rav, <b>concedes to me.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before them:</b> Is <b>this what</b> Shmuel <b>is saying:</b> The court <b>appraises</b> the value of an item or a carcass <b>even for</b> the sake of <b>a borrower, and Abba concedes to me; or perhaps, this is what</b> Shmuel <b>is saying: And I say</b> that the court <b>does not appraise</b> its value <b>even for a borrower, and Abba concedes to me?</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from the following incident: There was <b>a certain man who borrowed an ax from another and he broke it. He came before Rav</b> to rule if, and how much, he was liable to pay for it. Rav <b>said to him: Go and pay him with a full-fledged ax,</b> i.e., you must compensate the owner for the full value of the ax that you broke. The Gemara suggests: <b>Conclude from it</b> that the court <b>does not appraise</b> its value for the sake of a borrower.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>On the contrary, from</b> the fact <b>that Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav</b> on that occasion: <b>Is this the <i>halakha</i>? And</b> Rav <b>remained silent,</b> this suggests that he conceded to their opinion that the borrower should not have had to pay the full value of the ax. Accordingly, <b>conclude from it</b> that the court <b>appraises</b> an item’s value for the sake of a borrower.
An amoraic dispute <b>was stated: Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The court <b>appraises</b> a stolen item’s value <b>for a thief and for a robber. Rav Pappi says: It does not appraise</b> its value for them. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that the court <b>does not appraise</b> value <b>either for a thief or for a robber; but it appraises</b> value <b>for a borrower, in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Kahana and Rav Asi.</b>
§ The Gemara cites additional <i>halakhot</i> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: When a woman gives birth or miscarries a fetus she is thereby rendered ritually impure (see Leviticus 12:1–5). Even if she delivers only the afterbirth, with no discernible fetus, she is rendered ritually impure due to the possibility that the fetus was dissolved in the afterbirth, and it is therefore considered as though she delivered it (<i>Nidda</i> 24b). The length of the period of impurity depends on the sex of the child. In the case where it is unclear what the sex is, she must observe the longer period of fourteen days (<i>Nidda</i> 29a). At the end of that period she may purify herself by immersing in a ritual bath. <b>And Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If <b>part of</b> the <b>afterbirth [<i>shilya</i>] emerged on the first day</b> of a woman’s miscarriage <b>and part of it</b> emerged <b>on the second day, one counts</b> the period of ritual impurity <b>from the first</b> day.
<b>Rava said to him,</b> to Ulla: <b>What</b> is the rationale for <b>your opinion</b> to begin counting from the first day? It would appear to be based on the following: Ritual impurity is engendered only once the woman has delivered the fetus. This is defined as the emergence of the majority of the fetus or its head. Since in this case the fetus is not discernible, one must consider the possibility that it had already emerged on the first day, and therefore one is required <b>to act stringently</b> and regard her as impure from the first day.
Rava questions the propriety of acting stringently in this case, as it is <b>a stringency that results in a leniency, because</b> if she begins counting from the first day, <b>you will</b> also <b>render her</b> fit to immerse and become <b>pure from</b> fourteen days <b>after the first</b> day. This is a leniency because it is possible that the majority of the fetus emerged only on the second day and therefore her period of impurity began only then. She will therefore remain impure until the fifteenth day.
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> With regard <b>to being concerned</b> for the possibility that she is impure from the first day, <b>she should be concerned.</b> But with regard to <b>counting</b> the period of impurity, <b>one counts only from the second</b> day.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Ulla <b>teaching us</b> through this <i>halakha</i>? Does he mean to teach us <b>that part of the afterbirth</b> does not emerge <b>without</b> part of the <b>fetus</b> inside? But <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> that in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 77a): When an animal is ritually slaughtered, the animal and everything inside it becomes permitted for consumption. This applies to an unborn fetus as well. If prior to the slaughter the majority of the fetus emerged, it is considered to have been born, and therefore the entire fetus, even the part that is still within its mother, is not rendered permitted for consumption by the slaughter. Accordingly, if <b>part of the afterbirth emerged</b> prior to the slaughter, <b>it is prohibited to eat</b> it, because an afterbirth is <b>a sign of a fetus in a woman</b> and <b>a sign of a fetus in an animal.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>If</b> I would know this only <b>from the mishna, I would say</b>

Daf 11b

<b>that there is</b> a possibility that <b>part of the afterbirth</b> will emerge <b>without</b> part of <b>the fetus</b> inside, and the reason that the Sages forbid eating the afterbirth is due to a rabbinic <b>decree</b> prohibiting a case where <b>part of</b> an afterbirth emerges from the womb and part of it remains inside, <b>due to</b> the possibility that one may confuse it with a case where <b>all of</b> the afterbirth emerges. Therefore, Ulla <b>teaches us</b> that, in fact, part of the afterbirth does not emerge without part of the fetus inside.
The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: <b>And Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to a male <b>firstborn</b> child <b>who was mauled</b> by an animal <b>within thirty days</b> of his birth and died, one is <b>not required to redeem him,</b> as the requirement to do so, by paying five <i>sela</i> to a priest, applies only once the child is thirty days old (see Numbers 18:15–16).
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rami bar Ḥama taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since it is stated:</b> “Yet <b>you shall redeem”</b> (Numbers 18:15), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if a male firstborn child was <b>mauled</b> by an animal <b>within thirty days</b> of his birth one should redeem him. Therefore, <b>the verse states “yet</b> you shall redeem”; the addition of the word “yet” serves to <b>differentiate</b> and limit the requirement to redeem the firstborn male.
The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: <b>And Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: A large animal,</b> such as a cow or a horse, <b>is acquired by</b> the buyer <b>pulling</b> the animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 25b): A large animal is acquired <b>by passing</b> the reins of the animal to the buyer? The Gemara explains: Rabbi Elazar <b>states</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>that <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And the Rabbis say: This and that,</b> i.e., both large and small animals, are acquired <b>through</b> the buyer <b>pulling</b> the animal. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: This and that</b> are acquired <b>through</b> the buyer <b>lifting</b> the animal.
The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: <b>And Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>brothers who divide</b> the estate they inherited, the court <b>appraises whatever</b> clothes are <b>upon them</b> if those clothes came from, or if they were purchased with money from, the deceased’s estate, and that sum is considered part of the portion they receive. But the court does <b>not appraise whatever is upon their sons and daughters.</b> In order to save the children from the humiliation of having to appear in court, the brothers waive their rights to the clothes the children are wearing.
<b>Rav Pappa said: Sometimes, it does not even appraise what-ever is upon</b> the brothers. <b>You find such</b> a case <b>with</b> the <b>eldest brother</b> where the other brothers waive their rights to the value of his clothes, <b>as it is beneficial for them</b> to have the eldest brother appear well dressed in order <b>that</b> when he represents their interests in dealings with others, <b>his words will be listened to</b> and respected.
The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: <b>And Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> In the case of <b>a bailee who conveyed</b> a deposit that was entrusted to him <b>to</b> another <b>bailee,</b> the first bailee is <b>exempt</b> for any occurrence for which he would have been exempt had he kept the deposit with him. The Gemara adds: <b>And it is not necessary</b> to state this in the case of <b>an unpaid bailee who conveyed</b> a deposit <b>to a paid bailee, thereby increasing</b> the level of <b>its safeguarding,</b> since the paid bailee has a greater level of accountability than an unpaid bailee. <b>Rather,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> in a case of <b>a paid bailee who conveyed</b> a deposit <b>to an unpaid bailee, thereby decreasing</b> the level of <b>its safeguarding.</b> In this case, the first bailee is <b>exempt</b> for any occurrence for which he would have been exempt had he kept the deposit with him, <b>because he conveyed</b> it <b>to a mentally competent person</b> and thereby fulfilled his responsibility to ensure the deposit is safeguarded.
<b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>a bailee who conveyed</b> a deposit <b>to</b> another <b>bailee,</b> the first bailee becomes <b>liable</b> to pay for any loss to the item, even for mishaps for which he would not have been liable had he kept the deposit with him. The Gemara adds: <b>And it is not necessary</b> to state this in a case of <b>a paid bailee who conveyed</b> a deposit <b>to an unpaid bailee, thereby decreasing</b> the level of <b>its safeguarding. Rather,</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> in the case of <b>an unpaid bailee who conveyed</b> a deposit <b>to a paid bailee,</b> thereby increasing the level of its safeguarding; he is <b>liable.</b>
The reason he is liable is <b>that</b> the owner of the deposit <b>can say to him: You are credible to me with regard to</b> taking <b>an oath,</b> but <b>this</b> other bailee, to whom you conveyed my item, <b>is not credible to me with regard to</b> taking <b>an oath.</b> If an occurrence for which a bailee does not carry liability occurs, damaging the deposit, in order to release himself from an obligation to pay the bailee must take an oath to the item’s owner that none of the types of occurrences for which he bears liability occurred. Rava rules that the owner is required to accept an oath only from the bailee with whom he entrusted his item, but not from anyone else. Accordingly, since the first bailee was not present when the event occurred, he is unable to attest to what happened, and even if the second bailee takes an oath to that effect, the owner is not expected to accept his oath. Consequently, the first bailee bears full liability for any loss.
The Gemara cites another <i>halakha</i> taught by Ulla, citing Rabbi Elazar: <b>And Ulla says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one can collect from</b> the debtor <b>the slaves</b> that he owns as payment for a debt.
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Ulla:</b> Did <b>Rabbi Elazar say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even</b> when collecting <b>from</b> a debtor’s <b>orphans?</b> A creditor can collect the debt from orphans only by taking the land the debtor bequeathed to his children. Rav Naḥman asked whether this also extends to collecting any slaves the children inherited. Ulla replied: <b>No,</b> a creditor collects a debt by taking slaves only when he collects directly <b>from</b> the debtor himself. Rav Naḥman challenges this: But when the creditor collects <b>from him,</b> he can collect the debt <b>even from the cloak that is upon his shoulders,</b> and therefore he can certainly also collect the debt by taking his slaves, so what is the novelty of this ruling?
Ulla explains: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case in <b>which</b> the debtor <b>set aside</b> his slave <b>as designated repayment [<i>appoteiki</i>].</b> Consequently, if the slave was subsequently sold to a third party and the debtor was later unable to repay the debt, the creditor can seize the slave from the third party as payment of the debt. Even though generally only land can be seized from a buyer as payment for the seller’s debt, a slave is considered to have similar status to land in this regard. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava, as Rava says:</b> If a master <b>set aside his slave</b> as <b>designated repayment</b> of a debt <b>and</b> then <b>sold him,</b> the master’s <b>creditor collects</b> the debt <b>by</b> taking the slave; but if one set aside <b>his ox</b> as <b>designated repayment and</b> then <b>sold it,</b> the <b>creditor does not collect</b> the debt <b>by</b> taking the ox.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this difference? The Gemara explains: The designation of <b>this</b> slave generates <b>publicity,</b> since a slave is significant and identifiable, therefore any prospective buyer is assumed to have been aware of the status of the slave and accepted the consequences of purchasing him. <b>But</b> the designation of <b>this</b> ox <b>does not</b> generate <b>publicity,</b> since one ox is not easily distinguishable from another, and a buyer cannot be assumed to be aware that the ox was set aside as designated repayment. Therefore it is unfair that one who purchases such an ox should have it seized from him. Therefore, the Sages enacted that a creditor cannot do so.

Daf 12a

The Gemara relates: <b>After</b> Rav Naḥman <b>exited</b> the study hall, <b>Ulla said to</b> the remaining Sages in the study hall: In truth, <b>this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> A slave can be collected as payment <b>even</b> when collecting <b>from</b> the debtor’s <b>orphans.</b> Generally, when collecting a debt from the debtor’s orphans the creditor can collect only from the land that they inherited from their father, which is liened to the debt. Rabbi Elazar rules that a creditor can also collect from the slaves they inherited, as he holds that in this regard, the legal status of slaves is like that of land. Ulla did not reveal this fact to Rav Naḥman, as he knew that Rav Naḥman disagreed and held that the legal status of slaves is like that of movable property. When he heard of Ulla’s revelation, <b>Rav Naḥman said: Ulla evaded me,</b> as had he told me Rabbi Elazar’s full opinion, I would have brought proofs against his opinion.
The Gemara relates: <b>There was an incident in Neharde’a, and the judges of Neharde’a collected,</b> on behalf of a creditor, slaves that orphans had inherited from the debtor. <b>There was an incident in Pumbedita, and Rav Ḥana bar Bizna collected</b> slaves from orphans as repayment for a debt. <b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> those judges: <b>Go and return</b> those slaves to the orphans, <b>and if</b> you do <b>not</b> do so, <b>we will collect</b> the value of the slaves <b>from</b> the proceeds of <b>your own mansions</b> in order to compensate the orphans for their loss, as you have made a elementary mistake in your ruling and therefore you are responsible to rectify it.
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: There is Ulla, there is Rabbi Elazar, there are the judges of Neharde’a, and there is Rav Ḥana bar Bizna,</b> all of whom ruled based on the assumption that the legal status of slaves is like that of land. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>does the Master,</b> i.e., you, Rav Naḥman, <b>hold?</b>
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I know a <i>baraita</i></b> that supports my opinion, <b>as Avimi teaches: A document that prevents the Sabbatical Year from abrogating an outstanding debt [<i>prosbol</i>] takes effect upon</b> a debt assumed by one who owns <b>land, but</b> a <i>prosbol</i> <b>does not take effect upon</b> a debt assumed by one who owns <b>slaves</b> of the debtor. And <b>movable property is acquired together with the land</b> one acquires through the act of acquisition performed on the land, <b>but</b> movable property <b>cannot be acquired together with the slaves</b> that one acquires. Both <i>halakhot</i> assume that in these cases the legal status of slaves is not like that of land.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this issue is the <b>subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> in the following <i>baraitot</i>.
One <i>baraita</i> teaches: If <b>one sold slaves and land to</b> a buyer and the buyer <b>took possession of the slaves</b> alone, he <b>does not</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> the <b>land.</b> If he took possession <b>of the land</b> alone, he <b>does not</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> the <b>slaves.</b> If one sold <b>land and movable property to</b> a buyer and the buyer <b>took possession of the land</b> alone, he thereby also <b>acquires the movable property.</b> If he took possession <b>of the movable property</b> alone, he <b>does not</b> thereby <b>acquire the land.</b> If one sold <b>slaves and movable property to</b> a buyer and the buyer <b>took possession of the slaves</b> alone, he <b>does not</b> thereby <b>acquire the movable property.</b> If he took possession <b>of the movable property</b> alone, he <b>does not</b> thereby <b>acquire the slaves.</b>
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: If the buyer <b>took possession of the slaves</b> alone, he thereby also <b>acquires the movable property?</b> This directly contradicts the ruling in the parallel clause of the previous <i>baraita</i>.
<b>What, is it not</b> the case <b>that it is about this</b> that <b>they disagree, that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that the legal status of <b>slaves is like</b> that of <b>land,</b> and the other <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that the legal status of <b>slaves is like</b> that of <b>movable property?</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, said: According to everyone,</b> the legal status of <b>slaves is</b> generally <b>like</b> that of <b>land, and</b> therefore, <b>that which is taught</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, that by taking possession of the slaves <b>he</b> also <b>acquires</b> the movable property, is <b>properly</b> understood. <b>And that which is taught</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, that in such a case he <b>does not acquire</b> the movable property, the reason for this ruling is that the <i>tanna</i> of that <i>baraita</i> holds that in order for movable property to be acquired together with land, <b>we require</b> that he acquire <b>land similar to “fortified cities in Judea”</b> (II Chronicles 21:3), <b>which do not move around.</b> Slaves, even if their legal status is generally like that of land, do not fulfill this requirement.
The reason behind the need for land to be like the “fortified cities in Judea” is that the <i>halakha</i> that one can acquire movable property together with land is derived from this verse, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 26a): <b>Property that does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, <b>is acquired together with property that does serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land, be it <b>through</b> the buyer giving <b>money</b> to the seller, by the seller giving the buyer <b>a bill</b> of sale, <b>or by</b> the buyer performing an act of <b>taking possession.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Ḥizkiyya said: As the verse states: “And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judea”</b> (II Chronicles 21:3). The verse indicates that the acquisition of the movable property was done together with that of the cities of Judea.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rav Ika stated a different answer: <b>Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, said: According to everyone,</b> the legal status of <b>slaves is</b> generally <b>like</b> that of <b>movable property, and</b> therefore, <b>that which is taught</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, that by taking possession of the slaves <b>he does not</b> also <b>acquire</b> the movable property, is <b>properly</b> understood. <b>And that which is taught</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, that in such a case he <b>acquires</b> the movable property, applies to a case in which at the moment the slave was acquired, the movable property was <b>still upon him,</b> e.g., the slave was holding it, and it could therefore be acquired together with the slave. This is because one’s slave is considered like one’s courtyard, and any item that is placed within it is acquired for its owner.
The Gemara asks: <b>But even if</b> the movable property was <b>still upon him, what of it?</b> Even if one claims a slave is like a courtyard, he <b>is a mobile courtyard, and a mobile courtyard does not acquire</b> items placed upon it. <b>And if you would say</b> that the case is one <b>where the slave is standing</b> at the time of the transaction, that is still insufficient, as <b>didn’t Rava say: Anything that does not acquire when moving</b> also <b>does not acquire</b> when it is <b>standing or sitting.</b> The fact that the slave can move gives him the status of a mobile courtyard, regardless if he is currently moving or not.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is</b> that <b>where</b> a slave is <b>bound up</b> and is unable to walk, his status is like that of an immobile courtyard, and his master will acquire anything that is placed upon him at that time.
The Gemara presents another contradiction to the first <i>baraita</i> cited above, which explicitly states that one cannot acquire slaves by taking possession of land: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he took possession of the land</b> alone, he thereby also <b>acquires</b> the <b>slaves?</b>
The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <b>There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> just cited, the case is one <b>where</b> the slaves <b>are standing within</b> the borders of the land that was acquired.
The Gemara notes: <b>By inference,</b> the ruling of <b>this</b> first <i>baraita</i>, which states that <b>he does not acquire</b> the slaves, is stated with regard to a case <b>where they are not standing within</b> the borders of the land that was acquired.
<b>This works out well according to that</b> second <b>formulation of</b> that which <b>Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, said,</b> that the legal status of <b>slaves is like</b> that of <b>movable property. This is</b> the reason <b>that if</b> the slaves <b>are standing within</b> the borders of the land, <b>yes,</b> they are acquired together with the land, but <b>if not, no,</b> they are not acquired. The Gemara assumes that movable property is acquired together with land only if at the time of the acquisition it is placed upon the land.
<b>But according to that</b> first <b>formulation</b> of that which Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, <b>said, that</b> the legal status of <b>slaves is like</b> that of <b>land, why do I</b> need the slaves to be <b>standing within</b> the borders of the land? As <b>doesn’t Shmuel say:</b> If someone <b>sold him ten fields,</b> located <b>in ten</b> different <b>countries, once he takes possession of one of them, he has acquired all of them?</b> If the legal status of slaves is like that of land, then the same principle should apply to them, and it should be unnecessary for them to be standing within the land’s borders.
The Gemara reconsiders: <b>But</b> even <b>according to your reasoning,</b> one can ask: <b>According to</b> the second <b>formulation of</b> that which Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, <b>said, that</b> the legal status of <b>slaves is like</b> that of <b>movable property, why do I</b> need the slaves to be <b>standing within</b> the borders of the land?

Daf 12b

Don’t <b>we maintain</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that we do not need</b> movable property <b>to be piled up</b> upon the land one acquires in order to acquire the movable property together with it?
<b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> Perforce, <b>movable property that moves around</b> by itself, such as slaves, <b>is different from movable property that does not move around</b> by itself, i.e., inanimate objects. The <i>halakha</i> that movable property does not need to be piled up upon the land applies only to the latter. Accordingly, in order to acquire slaves together with land, they must be standing within its borders.
Given this distinction, one can say that <b>here, also,</b> an entity legally classified as <b>land that moves around,</b> such as a slave, <b>is different from land that does not move around.</b> Accordingly, <b>a slave,</b> which is classified as <b>land that moves around,</b> is not included in Shmuel’s ruling, as in his ruling <b>there,</b> he refers only to acquiring multiple plots of land, which is possible only because the <b>crust [<i>sadna</i>] of the earth is one</b> block, and therefore each field is really only one part of a bigger whole. This rationale does not permit acquiring land and slaves together, as a slave is not attached to the earth and is separate from the land.
§ The mishna teaches: One is liable only with regard to damage caused to <b>property</b> for <b>which,</b> were he to use it for a non-sacred purpose, he <b>would not be</b> liable <b>for</b> the <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property.
The Gemara infers: The property in question <b>does not have</b> the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>but</b> it <b>is consecrated</b> property, yet one is still liable for causing damage to it.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> who holds like this? The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The mishna is <b>referring to offerings of lesser sanctity and is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says</b> that such offerings, before they are slaughtered, <b>are</b> considered <b>property of</b> their <b>owners,</b> as opposed to property of Heaven. It is only once such an offering is slaughtered that it becomes subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse of consecrated property.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that concerning one who steals another’s property and takes a false oath denying he has done so, incurring the obligation to bring a guilt-offering, the verse states: <b>“And commits a trespass against the Lord,</b> and deals falsely with his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). The verse serves <b>to include</b> a case in which one denies having in his possession <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, which are property of</b> their owners. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 52b): In the case of a priest <b>who betroths</b> a woman <b>with his portion</b> of an offering, <b>whether it is from offerings of the most sacred order or from offerings of lesser sanctity, she is not betrothed? Shall we say that</b> this mishna is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili?</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, as when Rabbi Yosei HaGelili said</b> that offerings of lesser sanctity are the property of their owners, that applies only <b>when</b> the animal is still <b>alive. But after</b> its <b>slaughter, even Rabbi Yosei HaGelili concedes</b> that the offering takes on a higher degree of sanctity and is now the property of Heaven. <b>As when they receive</b> their portions, they do not receive them because those portions belong to them; rather, <b>they receive</b> them <b>from the table of the Most High,</b> i.e., they have the right to partake of them, but do not own them.
The Gemara asks: <b>But does he say</b> his opinion only <b>when</b> the offering is still <b>alive? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 1:2): With regard to the male <b>firstborn</b> of a kosher animal, which is endowed upon its birth with the sanctity of an offering of lesser sanctity, a priest <b>may sell it</b> if it is <b>unblemished</b> and <b>alive,</b> but he may not sell it once it is slaughtered, as if an unblemished firstborn animal is slaughtered it is prohibited to derive benefit from it, <b>and</b> if it is <b>blemished,</b> one can sell it both when it is <b>alive or</b> after it is <b>slaughtered, and one can betroth a woman with it.</b> This mishna assumes that even when a firstborn animal is unblemished it is considered to be the property of the priest.
<b>And Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to the status of <b>a firstborn</b> animal <b>in the present; since it is not fit to be sacrificed,</b> as there is no Temple, <b>the priests have ownership of it. But when the Temple is standing,</b> in <b>which</b> case the animal <b>is fit to be sacrificed, no.</b> When the Temple is standing a priest may slaughter and eat the firstborn only if it becomes blemished. Nowadays, since it is not possible to offer it as a sacrifice, it is certain that the animal will eventually develop a blemish and the priest will then be permitted to slaughter and eat it. Consequently, the priest is considered to have ownership of the firstborn even before it develops any blemish.
<b>And Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from the <i>baraita</i> cited above: The verse states: “A person who sins <b>and commits a trespass against the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 5:21). The verse serves <b>to include</b> a case in which one denies having in his possession <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, as they are the property of</b> their owners; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s statement is clearly referring to a time when the Temple is standing, as it is based on a verse that continues to obligate one to bring a guilt-offering. Nevertheless, he states that offerings of lesser sanctity, of which a firstborn is an example, are considered to be the property of their owners even when they are unblemished.
<b>And Ravina answered</b> that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s statement is said <b>with regard to a firstborn outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>and is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, who says: If</b> firstborn animals <b>came</b> from outside of Eretz Yisrael to Eretz Yisrael and they are <b>unblemished, they may be sacrificed</b> on the altar. From Rabbi Shimon’s formulation it is apparent that <b>if they came,</b> then <b>yes,</b> they are sacrificed, but they should <b>not</b> be brought <b><i>ab initio</i>.</b> Since the firstborn animals should not be brought to Eretz Yisrael, they are considered unfit to be sacrificed, and therefore they are considered to be the property of the priest even before they develop a blemish.
It is apparent that Ravina understood Rav Naḥman’s qualification to be true even according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Therefore, the Gemara asks: <b>And if it is so that when Rabbi Yosei HaGelili said</b> that an offering of lesser sanctity <b>is the property of</b> its owner, that was referring only to a situation <b>when</b> they are still <b>alive,</b>

Daf 13a

<b>let</b> Ravina <b>answer</b> Rava’s objection by saying: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that an offering of lesser sanctity is the property of its owner and may be sold even when the Temple stands, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> and it is referring to a case where the animal is still alive. And <b>that</b> qualification of the mishna by Rav Naḥman, that the sale of an unblemished firstborn animal when the Temple is standing is invalid, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who dispute Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s opinion.
The Gemara answers: <b>He said to him</b> that this is not difficult: <b>Do you speak</b> of <b>gifts</b> to which members <b>of the priesthood</b> are entitled, of which a firstborn animal is an example? <b>Gifts of the priesthood are different</b> from other offerings of lesser sanctity, <b>as when</b> the priests <b>receive</b> their portions, <b>they receive</b> them <b>from the table of the Most High.</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili claims that the act of consecration of an animal as an offering of lesser sanctity does not nullify one’s ownership of the animal. The sanctity of a firstborn offering takes effect with its birth, so it may be that it was never owned; rather, it is reasonable that the Torah provided the priest only with the right and the obligation to partake of it after it is sacrificed.
§ The Gemara considers <b>the</b> matter <b>itself:</b> The <i>baraita</i> teaches: Concerning one who steals another’s property and takes a false oath denying he has done so, incurring the obligation to bring a guilt-offering, the verse states: <b>“And commits a trespass against the Lord,</b> and deals falsely with his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). The verse serves <b>to include</b> a case in which one denies having in his possession <b>offerings of lesser sanctity, which are</b> the <b>property of</b> their owners, and are included in the phrase “and deals falsely with his neighbor.” This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Ben Azzai says:</b> This phrase serves <b>to include peace-offerings. Abba Yosei ben Dostai says: Ben Azzai said this only with regard to a firstborn</b> offering.
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ben Azzai says:</b> This phrase serves <b>to include peace-offerings.</b> The Gemara asks: Ben Azzai’s interpretation of the phrase, limiting its interpretation to a reference only to peace-offerings, is <b>to exclude what?</b>
<b>If we say</b> it is <b>to exclude a firstborn</b> offering, because he holds that a firstborn is not the property of the priest, one could reject this, as the sanctity of a firstborn offering is a lesser sanctity than that of a peace-offering, as follows: <b>Now, just as</b> with regard to <b>peace-offerings, which</b> have a higher degree of sanctity such that <b>they require placing hands</b> on the head of the offering <b>and</b> are accompanied by <b>libations and the waving of</b> their <b>breast and</b> the right <b>hind leg</b> by the priest and owner together, <b>you</b> nevertheless <b>say</b> that <b>it is the property of the owners, is it necessary</b> to state that with regard to <b>a firstborn</b> offering, for which these <i>halakhot</i> do not apply, that the priest has ownership of it?
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Ben Azzai mentioned peace-offerings in order <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>tithe</b> offering, i.e., every tenth animal of one’s flock that is designated as tithe for those ten animals and is sacrificed as an offering of lesser sanctity. Animal tithes are excluded because ben Azzai holds that an animal tithe offering is not the property of the owner of the flock.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to a firstborn</b> offering <b>it is stated: “You shall not redeem”</b> (Numbers 18:17), indicating that the owner can never fully redeem the offering, thereby removing its sanctity. <b>And</b> the firstborn offering <b>can be sold</b> when it is <b>unblemished</b> and <b>alive, or</b> when it is <b>blemished</b> and <b>alive, or</b> blemished and <b>slaughtered. With regard to</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offerings, <b>it is stated: “It shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33), indicating that the one who designated it can never fully redeem an animal tithe offering, thereby removing its sanctity. <b>And</b> the animal tithe offering <b>cannot be sold, not</b> when it is <b>alive and not</b> when it is <b>slaughtered, not</b> when <b>unblemished and not</b> when <b>blemished.</b> The fact that the sale of an animal tithe offering is invalid demonstrates that it is not the property of the one who designated it.
<b>Ravina taught</b> the preceding discussion <b>with regard to the last clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Yosei ben Dostai says</b> that <b>ben Azzai said this only with regard to a firstborn</b> offering. The Gemara asks: Abba Yosei ben Dostai’s interpretation of the phrase, limiting its interpretation to a reference only to a firstborn offering, is <b>to exclude what?</b>
<b>If we say</b> it is <b>to exclude peace-offerings,</b> because he holds that they are not the property of the one who consecrated them as offerings, one could reject this, as the sanctity of peace-offerings is a lesser sanctity than that of a firstborn offering, as follows: <b>Now, just as</b> with regard to <b>a firstborn</b> offering, <b>which is</b> already <b>sanctified</b> upon its emergence <b>from the womb</b> yet nevertheless <b>is the property of</b> the priest, <b>is it necessary</b> to state that <b>peace-offerings</b> are the property of those who consecrated them, where the animals were already the property of its owner before they were consecrated?
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> Abba Yosei ben Dostai mentioned peace-offerings in order <b>to exclude</b> an animal <b>tithe</b> offering. Animal tithes are excluded because Abba Yosei ben Dostai holds that an animal tithe offering is not the property of the owner of the flock.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to a firstborn</b> offering <b>it is stated: “You shall not redeem”</b> (Numbers 18:17), indicating that the owner can never fully redeem the offering, thereby removing its sanctity. <b>And</b> the firstborn offering <b>can be sold</b> when it is <b>unblemished</b> and <b>alive, or</b> when it is <b>blemished</b> and <b>alive, or</b> blemished and <b>slaughtered. With regard to</b> animal <b>tithe</b> offerings, <b>it is stated: “It shall not be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 27:33), indicating that the one who designated it can never fully redeem an animal tithe offering, thereby removing its sanctity. <b>And</b> the animal tithe offering <b>cannot be sold, not</b> when it is <b>alive and not</b> when it is <b>slaughtered, not</b> when <b>unblemished and not</b> when <b>blemished.</b> The fact that the sale of an animal tithe offering is invalid demonstrates that it is not the property of the one who designated it.
The Gemara asks: How can one claim that Abba Yosei ben Dostai holds that peace-offerings are also owned by those who consecrated them? <b>Doesn’t</b> Abba Yosei ben Dostai <b>say:</b> Ben Azzai said this <b>only with regard to a firstborn</b> offering. The Gemara concedes: This <b>is difficult.</b>
§ The Gemara cites an alternative explanation of the mishna’s statement: <b>Rava said: What</b> does the mishna mean when it says: One is liable only for damage caused to <b>property</b> for <b>which,</b> were one to use it for a mundane purpose, one <b>would not be</b> liable <b>for</b> the <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property? It is referring to <b>property that is not</b> at all <b>subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>and what is that?</b> It is referring to any property <b>of an ordinary person,</b> which has no sanctity at all.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> explicitly: One is liable only for damage caused to property <b>of an ordinary individual.</b> The Gemara concedes: This <b>is difficult.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Abba says:</b> With regard to the case of an innocuous animal that was consecrated as <b>a peace</b>-<b>offering</b> and <b>that caused damage,</b> the injured party <b>collects</b> damages <b>from its meat,</b> i.e., from the portion of the offering that would have been eaten by its owners. This is in accordance with the general <i>halakha</i> that the payment for damage caused by an innocuous ox is collected exclusively from the proceeds of the sale of the body of the ox and not from any other property of its owner. <b>But he does not collect</b> the damages <b>from the sacrificial portions.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> that one collects exclusively from the meat portion and not from the <b>sacrificial portions,</b> as those are <b>to be offered up to God?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for Rabbi Abba to teach that there is no <b>collection from</b> the owner’s <b>meat</b> portions <b>corresponding</b> to the <b>sacrificial portions.</b> Payment for damage caused by an innocuous animal is half the amount of the damages, and can be no more than the value of the animal itself. Rabbi Abba is teaching that when assessing the damage to determine the amount to be paid, one deems the owner responsible only according to his share of the animal, i.e., the meat portions, in relation to the animal as a whole.
Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis engage in a dispute concerning the <i>halakha</i> in a case in which an ox pushed another animal into a pit (see 53a). If it were an innocuous ox, for which the Torah limits the owner’s liability to half the damages, the Rabbis rule that liability is incurred exclusively by the owner of the ox, i.e., he pays half the value of the damage, and the owner of the pit is entirely exempt. Rabbi Natan holds that since the damage was caused jointly by the ox and the pit, the owner of the ox need pay only half of what he would pay if his animal had been solely responsible, i.e., a quarter of the damages. Rabbi Natan further rules that the remaining sum can then be fully recovered from the owner of the pit, i.e., he pays the remaining three-quarters of the damages. The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion, of those <i>tanna’im</i>, does Rabbi Abba state his ruling?
<b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> then it <b>is obvious</b> and there is no need to state it, as <b>didn’t</b> the Rabbis <b>say: Whenever,</b> for whatever reason, the full cost of the damage <b>cannot be recovered from this</b> party, <b>it is not recovered from that</b> party, i.e., even though the injured party suffered the loss of the full value of his animal and recovered only half its value from the owner of the ox, he may not demand the remaining sum from the owner of the pit. So too, in this case, where the injured party cannot collect damages from the sacrificial portions, he cannot recover that loss from the meat portions of the one who brought the offering.
<b>And if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Natan, doesn’t he say: Whenever</b> the full cost of the damage <b>cannot be recovered from this</b> one, <b>it is recovered from that</b> one, i.e., since the owner of the ox pays only a quarter of the damages, the remaining sum can be recovered from the owner of the pit. So too, in this case, since the injured party cannot collect payment from the sacrificial portions, he should be able to recover that loss from the meat portions of the one who brought the offering, in contrast to the ruling of Rabbi Abba.
The Gemara explains: <b>If you wish, say</b> Rabbi Abba’s ruling is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Natan, and if you wish, say</b> his ruling is in accordance with <b>the Rabbis.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>If you wish, say</b> Rabbi Abba’s ruling is in accordance with <b>the Rabbis,</b> as one might have thought that <b>this matter,</b> the ruling of the Rabbis, <b>applies</b> only <b>where</b> the damage is caused by <b>two bodies,</b> such as an ox and a pit. <b>But where</b> the damage is caused by <b>one body,</b> as in the case of damage caused by a an animal consecrated as a peace-offering, the injured party <b>can say to</b> the owner of the animal: <b>From anywhere that I want to, I will recover</b> my losses, and accordingly, the injured party could collect the full cost of the damage from the meat portions of the one who brought the offering. Therefore, it is necessary for Rabbi Abba to teach that this is not the <i>halakha</i>.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> Rabbi Abba’s ruling is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Natan:</b> It is only <b>there that</b> the <b>owner of</b> the damaged <b>ox</b> can <b>say to the owner of the pit:</b> Since <b>I found my ox in your pit,</b> ultimately you bear responsibility for any damage, and therefore <b>whatever I cannot recover from the other</b> one, i.e., the owner of the ox, <b>I will recover from you.</b>

Daf 13b

<b>But here,</b> in the case of damage caused by an animal consecrated as a peace-offering, <b>is</b> the injured party actually <b>able to say:</b> Only the <b>meat</b> of the animal <b>caused damage</b> but the <b>sacrificial portions did not cause damage?</b> Since the entire animal caused the damage, he does not collect the full cost of the damage from the meat portions of the one who brought the offering.
<b>Rava says:</b> In the case of an innocuous animal consecrated as <b>a thanks-offering that caused damage,</b> the injured party <b>collects</b> damages <b>from its meat,</b> i.e., from the portion of the offerings that would have been eaten by the one who brought the offering, <b>but he does not collect from its bread,</b> i.e., from the offering of forty loaves of bread that accompanies the sacrifice of the animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> it <b>obvious</b> that he does not collect from the <b>bread?</b> The bread is not part of the animal that caused damage.
The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> for Rava to state this because of <b>the latter clause</b> of his ruling, which states: The <b>injured</b> party <b>eats</b> the <b>meat</b> portions of the offering according to the value of the damages owed to him, <b>but the one achieving atonement,</b> i.e., the one bringing the offering, <b>brings the bread.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t this also obvious?</b> Why should anyone else bring the bread? The Gemara explains: <b>Lest you say, since</b> the <b>bread</b> is a necessary <b>qualifying factor for</b> the <b>thanks-offering,</b> as without it one does not fulfill one’s obligation, <b>let</b> the owner of the offering <b>say to</b> the one eating it, why should <b>you eat</b> the <b>meat and I bring</b> the <b>bread?</b> If you wish to eat, you should bring the bread. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us that</b> the offering of the loaves of <b>bread is the obligation of the owners</b> of the offering.
§ The mishna teaches: One is liable only for damage caused to <b>property that belongs to members of the covenant.</b>
The Gemara asks: This clause serves <b>to exclude what? If</b> it serves <b>to exclude</b> the property of <b>a gentile, isn’t that</b> already explicitly <b>taught</b> in the mishna <b>below</b> (37b): In the case of <b>an ox of a Jew that gored an ox of a gentile,</b> the Jew is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> this as a principle in the mishna here <b>and then explains</b> it in greater detail in the mishna below.
The mishna continues: One is liable only for <b>assigned property.</b> The Gemara asks: This clause serves <b>to exclude what? Rav Yehuda said:</b> This clause serves <b>to exclude</b> a case in which an animal is injured but it is unclear which of two oxen, owned by different people, caused the damage. The owner of <b>this</b> ox <b>says</b> to the owner of the other: <b>Your ox caused</b> the <b>damage. And</b> the owner of <b>that</b> ox <b>says</b> to the owner of the other: <b>Your ox caused</b> the <b>damage.</b> Since it cannot be proven which ox actually caused the damage, neither owner is liable. The intention of the mishna is that one is liable only where the belligerent ox is assigned to, i.e., is known to be the property of, a specific individual.
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t that</b> explicitly <b>taught</b> in the mishna <b>below</b> (35a): If <b>two</b> oxen <b>were</b> seen <b>pursuing a single</b> ox, and then the single ox is found to be injured, and the owner of <b>this</b> ox <b>says</b> to the owner of the other: <b>Your ox caused</b> the <b>damage.</b> And the owner of <b>that</b> ox <b>says</b> to the owner of the other: <b>Your ox caused</b> the <b>damage.</b> In such a case, <b>both of them are exempt</b> since it is uncertain which one is guilty. The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> this as a principle in the mishna here <b>and then explains</b> it in greater detail in the mishna below.
<b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> in explanation of the mishna that the term assigned property serves <b>to exclude ownerless</b> property. The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which the mishna teaches that one is exempt? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to a case <b>where an ox belonging to us,</b> i.e., to a Jew, <b>gored an ownerless ox,</b> it is obvious that the owner bears no liability, as <b>who is claiming</b> damages <b>from him? Rather,</b> it must be referring to a case <b>where an ownerless ox gored an ox belonging to us,</b> and it teaches that the injured party does not have a right to damages.
The Gemara asks: What is the point of this <i>halakha</i>? If the injured party wishes to recover his losses, <b>let him go and take</b> the belligerent ox for himself, since it is currently ownerless. The Gemara explains: The mishna teaches that the injured party does not have any right to the ox, in order to teach that in a case <b>where another</b> person <b>preceded him and acquired it,</b> the injured party has no claim to it.
<b>Ravina said</b> an alternative interpretation of the mishna: The term assigned property serves <b>to exclude</b> a case in which an ox <b>gored and subsequently</b> its owner <b>consecrated</b> it, or where <b>it gored and subsequently</b> its owner <b>declared</b> it <b>ownerless.</b> Since the owners did not own the ox at the time the case was brought before the court, they are exempt from paying. Ravina explains that this is the intention of the mishna: That one is liable only when the property that caused the damage was owned by a responsible party both when it caused the damage and when it was tried. In this case, at the time of the court hearing it was not owned by a responsible party, as it was either consecrated or ownerless.
<b>It is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The <i>halakha</i> is that an ox that kills a person is stoned to death. The mishna states (44b) that this does not apply to an ox consecrated to the Temple or an ownerless ox. <b>Moreover, Rabbi Yehuda said: Even</b> if an ox <b>gored and</b> its owner <b>subsequently consecrated</b> it to the Temple, or if an ox <b>gored and</b> its owner <b>subsequently declared</b> it <b>ownerless,</b> the owner <b>is exempt</b> from liability, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And if the ox was wont to gore in time past, <b>and had been forewarned with its owner,</b> and he had not guarded it in, <b>and it killed a man</b> or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and also its owner shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:29). The repetition of the reference to the owner at the beginning and end of the verse indicates that the ox is not stoned <b>unless</b> the ox’s status as the owner’s property at the time of the <b>death</b> of the victim <b>and</b> at the time of the owner’s <b>standing trial is the same,</b> i.e., the ox is owned by a responsible party for both events.
The Gemara asks: <b>But do we not</b> also <b>require</b> that the ox’s status be the same at the time of the <b>verdict</b>? <b>Isn’t</b> the phrase: <b>“The ox shall be stoned” written with regard to</b> the time of the <b>verdict?</b>
<b>Rather, say</b> that the owner of the ox is exempt <b>unless</b> the ox’s status as the owner’s property at the time of the <b>death</b> of the victim and at the time of the owner’s <b>standing trial and at the verdict is the same,</b> i.e., the ox is owned by a responsible party for all three events.
§ The mishna teaches: One is liable for damage caused in any place <b>except for a domain designated</b> exclusively <b>for</b> the use of <b>the one responsible for the damage.</b> The Gemara explains the reason for this: This is <b>because</b> the one liable for the damage <b>can say to</b> the injured party: <b>What did your ox want in my domain?</b> One does not have to guard his ox from causing damage within his own property, since another person’s animal has no right to be there.
The mishna continues: <b>And</b> one is liable for damage caused in <b>a domain</b> designated for the joint use <b>of the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for the damage.</b>
The Gemara cites a dispute concerning this case that results in two different ways of interpreting the mishna: <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Avimi says:</b> With regard to <b>a courtyard</b> designated for <b>the</b> joint use of two <b>partners,</b> either one of them is <b>liable</b> for damage caused by the ox of one partner to the property of the other partner while <b>in it,</b> both <b>for the</b> category of <b>Eating and for the</b> category of <b>Trampling. And</b> accordingly, <b>this is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> One is liable for damage caused in any place <b>except for a domain designated</b> exclusively <b>for</b> the use of <b>the one responsible for the damage, as</b> he is <b>exempt</b> there; <b>but</b> in <b>a domain</b> designated for the joint use <b>of the injured</b> party <b>and the one responsible for the damage, when he causes damage, the one who is responsible for the damage is obligated</b> to pay damages. The statement in the mishna concerning a domain designated for joint use is the beginning of the following clause and introduces a case in which one is liable for damage.
<b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> In a courtyard designated for joint use, one is <b>exempt for</b> one’s ox causing damage to the property of his partner in <b>the</b> category of <b>Eating, and for</b> one’s ox causing damage to the property of his partner in <b>the</b> category of <b>Trampling. And</b> accordingly, <b>this is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> One is liable for damage caused in any place <b>except for a domain designated</b> exclusively <b>for</b> the use of <b>the one responsible for the damage, and</b> one is <b>also exempt</b> for damage done in <b>a domain</b> designated for the joint use <b>of the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for the damage.</b> The statement in the mishna about a domain designated for joint use is a continuation of the previous clause and adds an additional case in which one is exempt. <b>And</b> the following clause: <b>When one causes damage, the one liable for the damage is obligated</b> to pay damages, serves <b>to add</b> the fact that one is liable for damage in the framework of the category of <b>Goring,</b> which was not previously mentioned in the mishna.
This interpretation of the concluding clause of the mishna, as a reference to Goring, <b>works out well according to Shmuel,</b> in his dispute with Rav (3b) concerning the meaning of Ox and <i>Maveh</i> in the first mishna of this chapter. According to Shmuel they mean Trampling and Eating, respectively, and Goring has yet to be addressed. <b>But according to Rav, who says:</b> The term ox in the mishna includes damage caused by the ox <b>and all matters</b> involving damaging actions <b>that</b> are completed by <b>an ox,</b> including Goring, Eating, and Trampling, Goring is already addressed in the mishna. <b>What is added</b> by the clause: The <b>one liable for the damage is obligated</b> to pay damages?
The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add that which the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that elucidates the mishna’s statement. The mishna states: <b>When</b> an animal or item one is responsible to safeguard <b>causes damage, the one liable for the damage</b> caused by insufficiently safeguarding it <b>is obligated</b> to pay payments of restitution for damage. This serves <b>to include</b> the cases of <b>an unpaid bailee, a borrower, a paid bailee, and a renter,</b> in <b>which an animal,</b> e.g., an ox, <b>caused damage</b> while <b>in their possession.</b> If the ox was <b>innocuous,</b> he <b>pays half</b> of <b>the damages, and</b> if it was <b>forewarned,</b> he <b>pays</b> the <b>full damages.</b> If the ox was safely enclosed and a wall <b>broke open at night, or</b> if <b>bandits [<i>listin</i>] broke it open and</b> the ox <b>went out and caused damage,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> that the mishna states: <b>When</b> an animal or item one is responsible to safeguard <b>causes damage, the one liable for the damage</b> caused by insufficiently safeguarding it <b>is obligated</b> to pay payments of restitution for damage. This serves <b>to include</b> the cases of <b>an unpaid bailee, a borrower, a paid bailee, and a renter.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances?</b>
<b>If we say</b> that <b>the lender’s ox,</b> which was under the watch of the borrower, <b>injured the borrower’s ox,</b> and the <i>baraita</i> is teaching that the lender is liable to pay the borrower, why is this so? <b>Let</b> the lender <b>say to</b> the borrower: <b>If</b> my ox <b>had injured</b> an ox <b>in the world</b> at large, i.e., someone else’s ox, <b>you,</b> the borrower, <b>would be required to pay,</b> as you were entrusted with safeguarding it. <b>Now that</b> my ox <b>has injured your ox, should I be required to pay?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the case must be <b>that the borrower’s ox injured the lender’s ox,</b> and the <i>baraita</i> is teaching that the borrower is liable to pay. The Gemara asks: According to this interpretation, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that if the belligerent ox was innocuous, the borrower is liable to pay only half of the damages. But why? <b>Let</b> the lender <b>say to</b> the borrower: By borrowing my ox, you undertook full responsibility for it such that <b>if</b> my ox <b>had been injured</b> by an ox <b>from the world</b> at large, <b>you would be required to pay</b> me <b>for</b> the <b>entire</b> value of my <b>ox,</b> irrespective of whether the belligerent ox was considered innocuous or forewarned. <b>Now that</b> it is <b>your ox that injured</b> my ox, <b>should you</b> have to <b>pay</b> only <b>half</b> of <b>the damages?</b> This interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> is also difficult.
The Gemara explains: <b>Actually,</b> the case is <b>where the lender’s ox injured the borrower’s ox, and with what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where</b> the borrower <b>undertook</b> the responsibility of <b>safeguarding the body of</b> the lender’s ox from being injured,

Daf 14a

<b>but he did not undertake</b> the responsibility of <b>safeguarding</b> the lender’s ox to prevent it <b>from causing damage.</b> Accordingly, the lender remains responsible for his ox, and if it caused damage to the borrower’s ox the lender is liable, as in any other case in which his ox caused damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, say,</b> and try to explain accordingly, <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: If the ox was safely enclosed and a wall <b>broke open at night, or</b> if <b>bandits broke it open and</b> the ox <b>went out and caused damage,</b> the bailee is <b>exempt</b> from liability. The Gemara infers: If it broke open <b>during the day</b> and then caused damage, he is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: According to the interpretation offered in explanation of the previous clause, the <i>baraita</i> concerns a case in which one borrowed an ox but did not undertake the responsibility to prevent it from causing damage. If so, how can the latter clause imply that there are cases in which he is liable? If <b>he did not undertake</b> the responsibility of <b>safeguarding</b> the lender’s ox to prevent it <b>from causing damage,</b> he should never be liable for the damage that it caused.
The Gemara answers that the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> concerns a different case than that of the previous clause. <b>This</b> is what the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: If,</b> by contrast, the borrower <b>did undertake</b> the responsibility of <b>safeguarding</b> the lender’s ox to prevent it <b>from causing damage,</b> if it causes damage, the borrower is <b>liable.</b> But if the ox was safely enclosed and the wall enclosing it <b>broke open at night, or</b> if <b>bandits broke it open and</b> the ox <b>went out and caused damage,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara returns to its prior discussion of the mishna’s statement concerning property designated for the joint use of the injured party and the one liable for the damage. The Gemara cited Rabbi Elazar’s opinion that each partner is exempt from liability for any damage that falls within the categories of Trampling or Eating that their ox caused to the other partner’s property. The Gemara challenges his opinion: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Yosef teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In a courtyard</b> designated for the joint use <b>of partners, or</b> in <b>an inn [<i>pundak</i>],</b> one is <b>liable for Eating and for Trampling</b> caused by an ox of one partner to the property of the other. It would appear that this <i>baraita</i> is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> could have <b>said to you: But</b> how can <b>you understand</b> that this <i>baraita</i> provides a refutation of my opinion? <b>Are there not <i>baraitot</i> that disagree</b> with regard to this issue? <b>And it is taught</b> in accordance with my opinion in a <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (1:9): <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar would state four principles with regard to</b> the liability incurred based on where the <b>damage</b> occurs. With regard to <b>any</b> location <b>that is</b> the <b>property of the injured</b> party <b>and</b> is <b>not</b> the property <b>of the one liable for the damage,</b> the owner of an animal that causes damage is <b>liable for all</b> the damage caused there. If a place is the property <b>of the one liable for the damage and</b> is <b>not</b> the property <b>of the injured</b> party, the owner of an animal that causes damage is <b>exempt for all</b> the damage caused there.
If a place is the property <b>of</b> both <b>this</b> one <b>and that</b> one, <b>e.g., a courtyard</b> designated for the joint use <b>of partners or</b> a field in <b>the valley</b> that is used by the public, the owner of an animal that causes damage is <b>exempt for Eating and for Trampling</b> performed by his animal <b>in</b> that place. But <b>for goring, and for pushing, and for biting, and for crouching</b> upon items in order to damage them, <b>and for kicking,</b> which are all subcategories of the primary category of Goring, if the ox is <b>innocuous,</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the value of <b>the damage, and</b> if it is <b>forewarned, he pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
If a place where the damage occurs is the property <b>of neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one, <b>e.g., a courtyard that is not</b> owned by either <b>of the two of them,</b> the owner of an animal that causes damage is <b>liable for Eating and for Trampling</b> performed by his animal <b>in</b> that place. But <b>for goring, and for pushing, and for biting, and for crouching</b> upon items in order to damage them, <b>and for kicking,</b> which are all subcategories of the primary category of Goring, if the ox is <b>innocuous,</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the value of <b>the damage, and</b> if it is <b>forewarned, he pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
The Gemara notes that <b>in any event</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that in <b>a courtyard</b> designated for the joint use <b>of partners or</b> a field in <b>the valley</b> that is jointly owned, the owner of an animal that causes damage is <b>exempt for Eating and for Trampling</b> performed by his animal <b>in</b> that place. This <i>baraita</i> supports Rabbi Elazar’s opinion.
The Gemara comments: These <i>baraitot</i> <b>are difficult,</b> as they seem to contradict <b>one another.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> a jointly owned <b>courtyard,</b> which under the terms of their partnership is <b>designated for</b> the use of both <b>this</b> one <b>and that</b> one, i.e., as partners, <b>for</b> bringing <b>both produce and oxen</b> there. Since both partners have a right to keep their oxen there, they are not liable for any damage their oxen cause in the jointly owned space. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>of Rav Yosef</b> is taught <b>with regard to</b> a jointly owned <b>courtyard,</b> which under the terms of their partnership is <b>designated for</b> the purpose of bringing their <b>produce</b> there, <b>but it is not designated for</b> bringing <b>oxen</b> there. Accordingly, <b>with regard to</b> damage of the category of <b>Eating</b> caused by one partner’s ox to the other’s produce, <b>it is</b> equivalent to <b>a courtyard</b> owned exclusively by <b>the injured</b> party, and therefore he is liable.
The Gemara notes: In accordance with this explanation, the language of each of these <i>baraitot</i> is <b>also precise, as it teaches here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> of Rav Yosef, the case of a courtyard that is <b>similar to an inn,</b> where oxen are usually not allowed to be brought, <b>and it teaches there,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, the case of a courtyard that is <b>similar to</b> a field in the <b>valley,</b> where oxen are usually allowed to enter. <b>Conclude from it</b> that the Gemara’s distinction between the two <i>baraitot</i> is correct.
<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to this</b> interpretation of Rav Yosef’s <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since</b> the courtyard is <b>designated for</b> both of them to keep their <b>produce</b> there, they should not be liable for damage caused by their oxen there, as in order for one to be liable <b>don’t we need</b> a case that fits the depiction of the verse: <b>“And it consumed in a field of another”</b> (Exodus 22:4), <b>and</b> since they both have the right to use the courtyard it <b>does not</b> fulfill this condition.
<b>Abaye said to him: Since it is not designated for</b> them to keep <b>oxen</b> there, that is sufficient <b>for it to be termed “a field of another.”</b>
Given the distinction between the cases discussed in the <i>baraitot</i>, the Gemara reconsiders the dispute between Rav Ḥisda and Rabbi Elazar concerning the mishna’s statement about property whose use is designated for both the injured party and the one liable for the damage. <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: Let us say</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the <i>baraitot</i> do not disagree,</b> as they are referring to different cases, so too, the <b><i>amora’im</i>,</b> i.e., Rav Ḥisda and Rabbi Elazar, <b>also do not disagree,</b> as they are similarly referring to these different cases.
Ravina <b>said to him: Yes,</b> that is correct. <b>And</b> even <b>if you say</b> that <b>they disagree,</b> their dispute does not concern every case of a jointly owned courtyard, as the Gemara had assumed; rather, their dispute concerns specifically a courtyard designated for the use of their produce, but not the use of their oxen. And <b>they disagree whether</b> to accept <b>the difficulty</b> raised <b>by Rabbi Zeira,</b> that such a courtyard cannot be considered “a field of another,” <b>or</b> whether <b>to</b> accept <b>the resolution of Abaye,</b> that it can be considered “a field of another.”
§ The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> and analyzes the <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> cited above. It states: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar would state four principles with regard to</b> the liability incurred based on where the <b>damage</b> was caused. With regard to <b>any</b> location <b>that is</b> the <b>property of the injured</b> party <b>and</b> is <b>not</b> the property <b>of the one liable for the damage,</b> the owner of an animal that causes damage is <b>liable for all</b> the damage caused there.
The Gemara infers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>does not teach:</b> One is liable <b>for any [<i>al hakkol</i>]</b> damage caused there, which would suggest that one is liable for all types of damage. <b>Rather,</b> it teaches: <b>One is liable for all [<i>bakkol</i>]</b> the damage caused, which can be translated as: <b>For</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b> This indicates that even were one’s ox considered to be innocuous and caused damage of the category of Goring, which would generally incur liability for half the value of the damage, in this case the owner is liable for the full cost of the damage.
<b>Whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon, who says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of cases of <b>Goring</b> performed by an innocuous animal, which is <b>atypical,</b> done <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, is that the owner of the ox <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> even if the ox is innocuous.
If this is so, <b>say,</b> and try to explain accordingly, <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: If a place where the damage occurs is the property <b>of neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one, <b>e.g., a courtyard that is not</b> owned by either <b>of the two of them,</b> the owner of an animal that causes damage is <b>liable for Eating and for Trampling</b> performed by his animal <b>in</b> that place.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean by saying the property is <b>of neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one? <b>If we say</b> the intention of the <i>baraita</i> is that the property is <b>of neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one <b>at all,</b> but <b>rather</b> it belongs <b>to another</b> person, why should either partner be liable? <b>But don’t I need</b> a case that fits the depiction of the verse: <b>“And it consumed in a field of another”</b> (Exodus 22:4), which is understood to mean that the consumed produce belongs to the owner of the field in which the act of consumption occurred; <b>and</b> since the injured party does not have any rights to this place it <b>does not</b> fulfill this condition?
<b>Rather, it is obvious</b> that the intention of the <i>baraita</i> is that the property is <b>of neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one together; <b>rather,</b> it belongs <b>to</b> only <b>one</b> of them, i.e., the injured party, <b>and the latter clause teaches:</b> If the ox is <b>innocuous,</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the value of <b>the damage, and</b> if it is <b>forewarned, he pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
If so, in the latter clause <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of cases of <b>Goring</b> performed by an innocuous animal, which is <b>atypical,</b> occurring <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, is that the owner of the ox <b>pays half</b> the value of <b>the damage.</b>
The Gemara asks: Could it be that <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon and the last clause is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> that is <b>as Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda</b> with regard to another mishna (15b): <b><i>Shinnana</i>, leave the mishna and follow after me</b> and my interpretation that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon and the last clause is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> In this <i>baraita</i> as well, the different clauses are taught in accordance with different Sages’ opinions.
The Gemara presents a different interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ravina said in the name of Rava: The entire</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon, and what</b> does it mean by saying that the property is <b>of neither this</b> one <b>nor that</b> one? The property does <b>not</b> belong both <b>to this</b> one <b>and that</b> one; <b>rather,</b> it is designated <b>for</b> the use of only <b>one</b> of them, <b>for</b> him to keep his <b>produce</b> there. Only the injured party has the right to keep his produce there. But it is designated both <b>for this</b> one <b>and for that</b> one, <b>for</b> them to keep their <b>oxen</b> there, as both have this right.
Accordingly, <b>with regard to</b> damage of the category of <b>Eating,</b> the property <b>is</b> considered to be the <b>courtyard of the injured</b> party; therefore, the one responsible for the damage is liable to pay for the damage. By contrast, <b>with regard to</b> damage of the category of <b>Goring,</b> since they both have the right to keep their oxen there, the property <b>is</b> considered to be like <b>a public domain,</b> and therefore even Rabbi Tarfon agrees that if one’s innocuous ox causes damage there one is liable for only half the value of the damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> does the <i>baraita</i> list <b>four</b> principles? <b>There are</b> only <b>three.</b> In other words, according to the way Ravina explains the latter clause, i.e., the fourth principle, it does not teach anything that is not already known from the first three principles, as the fact that one is liable for Eating and Trampling in property designated for the use of the injured party is explicitly stated in the first principle, and the fact that one is liable for only half the cost of the damage in a case of Goring in a jointly owned courtyard is expressed in the third principle.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b>

Daf 14b

There are only <b>three</b> distinct <b>principles,</b> but they are listed as four cases because they apply <b>in four</b> different <b>places.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The determination of payment of damages is made by <b>monetary appraisal.</b> One pays with items <b>worth money.</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>before a court. And</b> it is <b>based upon</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses</b> who are <b>free men,</b> i.e., men who are not Canaanite slaves, and who are <b>members of the covenant,</b> i.e., Jews. <b>And women are included in the</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b>damages</b> in the same way as men. <b>And</b> both <b>the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for the damage</b> are involved <b>in</b> the <b>payment.</b> The Gemara will explicate each of these principles.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> is the meaning of: The determination of payment of damages is made by <b>monetary appraisal?</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda says: This appraisal</b> of the damage caused <b>should be</b> made <b>only in terms of</b> the <b>monetary</b> value of the damage.
The Gemara notes: <b>We learn,</b> in this mishna, <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that the Sages taught</b> explicitly: In a case in which <b>a cow damaged a cloak,</b> and the <b>cloak injured</b> the <b>cow,</b> e.g., the cow tread on it, thereby damaging it, and it became entangled in the cow’s legs, causing the cow to trip, <b>one does not say</b> that it may be presumed that the damage to the <b>cow is offset by</b> the damage to the <b>cloak and</b> the damage to the <b>cloak is offset by</b> the damage to the <b>cow,</b> and therefore the owners of both are exempt from any payment. <b>Rather,</b> the court <b>appraises</b> separately the damage caused to each side <b>in terms of</b> its <b>monetary</b> value and only then calculates to what extent the liabilities offset each other.
§ The mishna continues: With items <b>worth money;</b> to what does this refer?
This is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Payment is made with items <b>worth money.</b> This <b>teaches that</b> the <b>court attends to</b> the collection of damages <b>only</b> in order to collect from <b>property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land. <b>But if the injured</b> party <b>proceeded,</b> of his own accord, <b>to seize movable property</b> from the one liable for the damage, the <b>court collects</b> damages <b>for him from those</b> items he seized. According to the <i>baraita</i>, the phrase: Items worth money, is referring to land.
The Gemara analyzes this: <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: Payment is made with items <b>worth money.</b> This <b>teaches that</b> the <b>court attends to</b> the collection of damages <b>only</b> in order to collect from <b>property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land. The phrase: Items worth money, therefore, is used as a term for land. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this <b>inferred?</b>
<b>Rabba bar Ulla says</b> that the phrase: Items worth money, is referring to <b>something that is worth any</b> amount of <b>money,</b> and <b>what is that?</b> It is <b>something that is not subject to</b> price <b>fraud,</b> which is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to land. Unlike the sale of movable property, the sale of land is valid irrespective of the sum for which the land is sold. The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But slaves and documents are also not subject to</b> price <b>fraud,</b> and yet these are not included in the phrase: Items worth money, as the court does not collect payments of damages from them.
<b>Rather, Rabba bar Ulla said:</b> The phrase is referring to <b>something that is acquired with money,</b> which is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to land but not with regard to movable property (see <i>Kiddushin</i> 26a). The Gemara rejects this explanation: But <b>slaves and documents are also acquired with money.</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said:</b> The phrase is referring to something that is <b>worth money, but is not</b> actually <b>money, and all these</b> things, i.e., movable property, slaves, and documents, <b>are</b> considered like actual <b>money</b> because they have the defining characteristics of money in that they are valuable and portable.
<b>Rav Yehuda bar Ḥinnana raises a contradiction to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua:</b> In the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier <b>it is taught:</b> The mishna’s statement that payment is made with items <b>worth money teaches that</b> the <b>court attends to</b> the collection of damages <b>only</b> in order to collect from <b>property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land. <b>But it is taught</b> also in another <i>baraita</i>: The verse states the superfluous phrase: <b>“He shall recompense”</b> (Exodus 21:34), <b>to include</b> items <b>worth money, and even bran,</b> a relatively inferior commodity, is accepted as a valid form of payment. The first <i>baraita</i> teaches that only land is a valid form of payment, whereas the second <i>baraita</i> teaches that one may pay even with movable property.
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that teaches that the court collects damages only from land? We are dealing <b>with</b> a case where damages are collected from <b>orphans</b> whose father was liable to pay damages. The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the liability inherited by the orphans applies only to the land they inherited from their father as it is liened to their father’s debts.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to collection <b>from orphans, say,</b> and try to explain accordingly, <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: But <b>if the injured</b> party <b>proceeded,</b> of his own accord, <b>to seize movable property</b> from the one liable for the damage, the <b>court collects</b> damages <b>for him from those</b> items he seized. The Gemara asks: <b>If,</b> as suggested, the <i>baraita</i> is referring to collection <b>from orphans, why does the court collect</b> damages <b>for him from those</b> items he seized, as the father’s movable property is not liened to his debts?
The Gemara answers: The case is <b>like that which Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> with regard to a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 84a), which teaches that creditors who seize movable property as payment for a debt may keep those items: That is referring to a case in <b>which he seized</b> the property <b>while</b> the debtor was still <b>alive. Here also,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case in <b>which he seized</b> the property <b>while</b> the one liable for the damage was still <b>alive.</b>
§ The mishna continues: <b>Before a court.</b> What does this phrase mean?
This phrase should be understood as a qualification of the previous phrase in the mishna that teaches, as the Gemara explained, that a court collects damages only from land. The mishna then teaches that the court collects only from land that is still in the possession of the one liable for the damage when he appears in court. This <b>excludes</b> a case where the one liable for the damage <b>sells his</b> landed <b>property and afterward goes to court.</b> Since at the time of the hearing he no longer owns land, the court does not collect damages from it.
The Gemara challenges this: Should we <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that if one <b>borrows</b> money <b>and</b> then <b>sells his</b> landed <b>property, and afterward</b> he <b>goes to the court, the court does not collect</b> the loan <b>from those</b> landed properties that he sold? This is certainly incorrect, as the creditor has a lien on the debtor’s property from the time that he borrows the money.
<b>Rather,</b> the phrase: Before a court, should be understood as an independent clause that <b>excludes a court of non-ordained judges [<i>hedyotot</i>]</b> from judging all types of damages, as the payment for certain types of damage is considered to be a fine, and only expert judges who have been ordained are able to impose fines.
§ The mishna continues: Payment is made <b>based upon</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses.</b>
The Gemara explains: This clause is stated to <b>exclude</b> from liability one who <b>admits</b> he is liable to pay <b>a fine,</b> even if <b>witnesses come afterward</b> and testify that he is liable to pay it. The mishna teaches <b>that he is</b> nevertheless <b>exempt,</b> due to his admission.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says: One who admits</b> he is liable to pay <b>a fine</b> is <b>exempt,</b> even if <b>witnesses come afterward</b> and testify to his liability. <b>But according to the one who says:</b> With regard to <b>one who admits</b> he is liable to pay <b>a fine and</b> then <b>witnesses come afterward</b> and testify that he is guilty, he is <b>liable</b> to pay the fine, <b>what is there to say</b> in explanation of this clause of the mishna?
The Gemara answers: This clause does not serve to exclude some other case; rather, <b>it is needed</b> to preface <b>the latter clause</b> that teaches that the only people who are accepted as witnesses in cases of damages are both

Daf 15a

<b>free men and members of the covenant.</b> The mishna states: <b>Free men, to exclude</b> Canaanite <b>slaves</b> from being valid witnesses, and it states: <b>Members of the covenant, to exclude gentiles.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach both exceptions, <b>as had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only about <b>a slave,</b> I might have presumed that he is disqualified from serving as a witness <b>because he has no lineage,</b> i.e., the child of a Canaanite slave is not legally considered to be his child in any sense; <b>but a</b> free <b>gentile, who has lineage, I might say no,</b> he is qualified. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only about <b>a gentile,</b> I might have presumed that he is disqualified from serving as a witness <b>because he has no connection to</b> the <b>mitzvot</b> of the Torah; <b>but</b> with regard to a Canaanite <b>slave, who does have a connection to</b> the <b>mitzvot,</b> as he is obligated to keep the mitzvot that a woman is obligated to keep, <b>I might say no,</b> he is qualified. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to teach both exceptions.
§ The mishna continues: <b>And women are included in the</b> <i>halakhot</i> of <b>damages</b> in the same way as men. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived?
The Gemara presents three sources for this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says, and similarly, the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> The <b>verse states</b> with regard to the liability of one who takes a false oath that he had not stolen: <b>“When a man or woman shall commit any of the sins</b> of a person” (Numbers 5:6). <b>The verse equates a woman with a man with regard to all punishments in the Torah.</b>
<b>The school of Rabbi Elazar taught:</b> The verse states with regard to the civil laws given following the revelation at Sinai: <b>“And these are the civil laws that you shall set before them”</b> (Exodus 21:1). The reference to “them” in the verse is referring to all those who stood at the revelation, both men and women. <b>The verse</b> thereby <b>equates a woman with a man with regard to all civil laws in the Torah.</b>
<b>The school of Ḥizkiyya and Rabbi Yosei HaGelili taught:</b> The <b>verse states</b> with regard to liability in a case where one’s ox kills a person: <b>“And it killed a man or a woman”</b> (Exodus 21:29). <b>The verse</b> thereby <b>equates a woman with a man with regard to all killings in the Torah,</b> i.e., the liability incurred is the same whether the person killed was a man or a woman.
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> all three sources <b>are necessary, as had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only <b>the first</b> source, one might have said that it <b>is there</b> that men and women are equated, <b>as the Merciful One had pity upon</b> a woman and made her liable <b>in order that she should achieve atonement</b> through paying restitution. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>civil law,</b> one might say that for <b>a man, who is involved in business dealings, yes,</b> the civil laws apply to him, but to <b>a woman,</b> who generally is not involved in business dealings, the laws do <b>not apply.</b>
<b>And had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only that men and women are equated in <b>civil law,</b> one might have said that this is <b>in order that she should</b> be able to <b>sustain</b> herself by engaging in business dealings. If civil laws did not apply to a woman, one would be wary about conducting business with her. <b>But</b> with regard to obligating a woman to achieve <b>atonement,</b> one might have said that <b>a man, who is obligated in mitzvot, yes,</b> he is similarly obligated to achieve atonement; but <b>a woman, who is not obligated in</b> all the <b>mitzvot</b> to the same extent as a man, no, the obligation does <b>not</b> apply to her.
<b>And had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only <b>these</b> first <b>two</b> sources, one might have limited the fact that a woman and man are equated to these two cases, <b>here due to</b> the fact that she also needs <b>atonement, and there due to</b> the fact that she needs to be able to <b>sustain</b> herself. <b>But with regard to</b> one’s liability for his ox <b>killing</b> a person, one might have said that only for killing <b>a man, who is obligated in</b> all <b>mitzvot,</b> yes, the owner of the ox is liable <b>to pay a ransom;</b> but for killing <b>a woman,</b> who is not obligated in all mitzvot, one might say he is <b>not</b> liable.
<b>And had</b> the Torah <b>taught us</b> only the equivalence of a man and woman with regard to <b>a ransom,</b> one might have thought that this is <b>because</b> it is a very serious matter as <b>there is a loss of life, but</b> in <b>these</b> first <b>two</b> sources, <b>where there is not a loss of life, I would say no,</b> a woman is not included. Accordingly, it is <b>necessary</b> to have all three sources.
§ The mishna continues: <b>And</b> both <b>the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for the damage</b> are involved <b>in</b> the <b>payment.</b>
An amoraic dispute <b>was stated</b> with regard to the payment of <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> made when one’s innocuous ox gores another’s animal. <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> It is <b>monetary restitution</b> for the injured party’s loss. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says:</b> It is <b>a fine.</b>
The Gemara elucidates: <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The payment is <b>monetary restitution,</b> as <b>he holds</b> that even <b>ordinary oxen,</b> which have not been forewarned with regard to Goring, are <b>not presumed to be safeguarded,</b> as their nature does not prevent them from acting in a belligerent manner. Therefore, the owner is responsible to safeguard them, to prevent them from doing so. Accordingly, if an ox causes damage by goring, <b>by right it</b> should have been <b>that</b> the owner <b>needs to pay</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the damage. Nevertheless, <b>the Merciful One had pity upon him, as his ox had not yet been forewarned</b> and he was not fully aware of the possibility that it might gore, and accordingly, the Torah reduced the extent of his liability.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says:</b> It is <b>a fine,</b> as <b>he holds</b> that <b>ordinary oxen</b> are <b>presumed to be safeguarded,</b> as their nature prevents them from acting in a belligerent manner. Therefore, the owner is not responsible for safeguarding them to prevent them from doing so. Accordingly, if an ox causes damage by goring, <b>by right it</b> should have been <b>that</b> the owner <b>does not pay at all.</b> Nevertheless, <b>the Merciful One penalized him in order that he will safeguard his ox,</b> even before it is forewarned, and decreed that the fine should be given to the injured party even though he is not really entitled to be compensated for his loss.
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: Both <b>the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for the damage</b> are involved <b>in</b> the <b>payment. Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <b>the</b> payment of <b>half the</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> is <b>monetary restitution,</b> this assumes that the injured party is theoretically entitled to receive the full value of his damaged animal but in practice receives only half. <b>This is</b> what the mishna means by saying <b>that the injured</b> party is also <b>involved in</b> the <b>payment,</b> because it is as though he is compelled to forgo half of the cost of the damage that by right he should be paid. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>the</b> payment of <b>half the</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> is <b>a fine,</b> which assumes that the injured party is not really entitled to be compensated for his loss, <b>now that</b> even the money that <b>he takes is not his</b> by right, is it accurate to describe him <b>as being</b> involved <b>in the payment?</b>
The Gemara explains: The mishna’s statement <b>is necessary only with regard to</b> the fact that the injured party is the one who absorbs the loss due to the <b>diminishing</b> value <b>of the carcass</b> between the animal’s death and the time that the case is brought before the court. Since he must absorb this financial loss, it may be said that he is involved in the payment.
The Gemara asks: How can one claim that the mishna is referring to the <b>diminishing</b> value <b>of the carcass? Isn’t it</b> already <b>taught</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, which by using the term: <b>Payments</b> of restitution <b>for damage, teaches that the owner</b> of the injured animal <b>attends to,</b> i.e., retains ownership of, <b>the animal carcass?</b> And therefore it follows that he bears any depreciation in its value, as the Gemara (10b) explained above.
The Gemara explains why the mishna needs to teach this principle twice: <b>One</b> mention is made <b>with regard to an innocuous</b> ox <b>and</b> the other <b>one</b> is made <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox.
<b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state both cases, <b>because if it would teach us</b> the principle only with regard to <b>an innocuous</b> ox, I might say that only there does the Torah limit the liability of the owner of the ox, <b>because it has not yet been forewarned. But</b> with regard to <b>a forewarned</b> ox, <b>I would say</b> the Torah does <b>not</b> limit the owner’s liability at all and the owner must also bear the loss due to the diminishing value of the carcass. <b>And</b> similarly, <b>if it would teach us</b> the principle only with regard to <b>a forewarned</b> ox, I might say that only there does the Torah limit the owner’s liability <b>because he is paying the full</b> cost <b>of</b> the damage, so the Torah does not overly burden him. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>an innocuous</b> ox, where he is liable for only half of the damage, <b>I would say</b> the Torah does <b>not</b> limit his liability any further, so he must bear the loss of the diminishing value of the carcass. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> to state the principle in both cases.
The Gemara attempts to prove whether the payment of half the cost of the damage is considered to be monetary restitution or a fine: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (16b): <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the liability incurred for damage caused by <b>an innocuous</b> ox <b>and</b> that caused by <b>a forewarned</b> ox? The difference is <b>that</b> the owner of <b>an innocuous</b> ox <b>pays half the</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> exclusively <b>from</b> proceeds of the sale of <b>its body, and</b> the owner of <b>a forewarned</b> ox <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property.
The Gemara explains the challenge posed by the mishna: <b>And if it is so,</b> that payment for damage caused by an innocuous ox is considered a fine, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>also teach this</b> additional distinction: The owner of <b>an innocuous</b> ox <b>does not pay based on his own</b> admission, in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> that one does not pay a fine based on one’s own admission, whereas the owner of <b>a forewarned</b> ox <b>pays based on his own</b> admission.
The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> could have taught this distinction; however, <b>he taught</b> only certain distinctions <b>and omitted</b> others, including this one. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> else <b>did he omit that he omitted this?</b> A <i>tanna</i> would never omit just a single case, perforce there must be another <i>halakha</i> he omitted.
The Gemara answers: <b>He omitted</b> the <i>halakha</i> that if an innoc-uous ox kills someone, its owner does not pay even <b>half of the ransom</b> payment, whereas if the ox is forewarned, he pays the full ransom.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>If</b> one claims that the mishna omits the <i>halakha</i> of one who admits his liability <b>due to</b> the fact that it also omits the <i>halakha</i> that the owner of an innocuous ox does not pay even <b>half of the ransom,</b> that is a flawed claim, as <b>this is not an omission,</b> because one could say: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? It <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says</b> that when <b>an innocuous</b> ox kills a person, one <b>pays half the ransom,</b> and therefore the distinction between an innocuous and forewarned ox is included in the mishna’s ruling that the owner of an innocuous ox pays half the cost of the damage. Accordingly, no proof can be adduced from the mishna.
The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 41a):

Daf 15b

If one admits: <b>My ox killed so-and-so, or</b> my ox killed <b>so-and-so’s ox,</b> then <b>this</b> person <b>pays based on his own</b> admission.
The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <b>What, is</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna <b>not</b> stated <b>with regard to an innocuous ox?</b> If so, this mishna proves that one is required to pay for half the cost of the damage even based on one’s own admission, which demonstrates that the payment is monetary restitution and not a fine.
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>No,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this explanation, if it had been an <b>innocuous</b> ox that gored, <b>what</b> would be the <i>halakha</i>? Would one say that <b>indeed, he does not pay based on his own</b> admission? But <b>if so, rather than teaching</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna in <i>Ketubot</i>: If one admits: <b>My ox killed so-and-so’s</b> Canaanite <b>slave, he does not pay based on his own</b> admission, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>differentiate and teach</b> the distinction <b>with regard to</b> the case raised in the first clause <b>itself.</b> The reason for the distinction between the cases when one’s ox kills a Jew or a Canaanite slave is that in the first one pays monetary restitution, while in the second one pays a fine. If the mishna wishes to demonstrate the difference between a fine and monetary restitution with regard to admission, then instead of introducing a new case, the mishna would have modified the case of the previous clause.
The mishna would have continued: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> in the first clause <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox, <b>but with regard to</b> an admission that one’s <b>innocuous</b> ox gored, <b>he does not pay based on his own</b> admission. The fact that the mishna does not do so suggests that in fact one is required to pay for half the cost of the damage based on one’s own admission that his innocuous ox gored. Evidently, the payment is considered to be monetary restitution.
The Gemara rejects this: The reason the mishna did not raise the distinction between an innocuous and a forewarned ox is not because that distinction is not a valid one, but because the <b>entire</b> mishna <b>speaks</b> only <b>of</b> cases of <b>a forewarned</b> ox. Accordingly, no proof can be adduced from the mishna.
The Gemara suggests further: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the concluding clause of the mishna just cited: <b>This is the principle: Anyone who pays more than</b> the cost of <b>that which he damaged does not pay based on his own</b> admission. The Gemara infers: <b>What, is it not</b> that were he liable to pay <b>less than</b> the cost of <b>that which he damaged, he would pay</b> based on his own admission? Since when an innocuous ox gores, its owner is liable to pay more than the cost of the damage, the payment is clearly not monetary restitution, and this is why it is not payable based on one’s own admission.
The Gemara rejects the inference: <b>No,</b> one should infer only that were he liable to pay <b>as much as</b> the cost of <b>that which he damaged, he pays</b> based on his own admission. If the sum to be paid is more or less than the cost of that which he damaged, he would not pay based on his own admission.
The Gemara asks. <b>But</b> according to that opinion, where one is liable to pay <b>less</b> than the cost of the damage, <b>what</b> would be the <i>halakha</i>? Would one say that, <b>indeed, he does not pay</b> based on his own admission? <b>If so, instead of teaching: This is the principle: Anyone who pays more than</b> the cost of <b>that which he damaged does not pay based on his own</b> admission, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> instead: <b>This is the principle: Anyone who does not pay as much as</b> the cost of <b>that which he damaged</b> does not pay based on his own admission. <b>As</b> that statement <b>indicates</b> cases where one is liable to pay <b>more</b> than the cost of that which he damaged <b>and it</b> also <b>indicates</b> cases where one is liable to pay <b>less</b> than the cost of that which he damaged. Evidently, the mishna holds that where one’s liability is for less than the cost of the damage, it is payable based on one’s own admission. This therefore provides <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion that the payment for half the cost of the damage is a fine.
The Gemara adds: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that the payment for <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage is a fine.</b>
The Gemara notes the obvious inconsistency: How can it be that the Gemara offers <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion that the payment for half the cost of the damage is a fine <b>and</b> then state that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with that opinion?
The Gemara explains: <b>Yes,</b> the <i>halakha</i> may be in accordance with that opinion because of the following resolution of the refutation. <b>What is the reason</b> that the Gemara held that <b>there is a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion that the payment for half the cost of the damage is a fine? <b>Because</b> the mishna <b>does not teach:</b> Anyone who does not pay <b>as much as</b> the cost of <b>that which he damaged</b> does not pay based on his own admission. This is not, in fact, a conclusive refutation, as even if one holds that the payment of half the cost of the damage for an innocuous ox is considered monetary restitution, one can still explain why the mishna doesn’t discuss cases where one is liable for less than the cost of the damage.
This is because the <i>tanna</i> <b>cannot make an absolute</b> statement about such cases, that one never pays based on one’s own admission. <b>Since there is</b> an obligation for one to pay for <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> resulting from <b>pebbles</b> inadvertently propelled by the foot of a walking animal, <b>which, through tradition it is learned that</b> this payment <b>is monetary restitution,</b> and it is <b>due to that</b> reason that the mishna <b>does not teach</b> cases where one’s liability is valued at less than the cost of the damage.
The Gemara considers the ramifications of this <i>halakha</i>: <b>And now that you have said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is that the payment of <b>half the</b> cost of the <b>damage is a fine,</b> with regard to <b>this</b> innocuous <b>dog that ate lambs or</b> this innocuous <b>cat that ate a chicken,</b> which <b>is atypical</b> behavior for dogs and cats, <b>we do not collect</b> the payment for these acts in the courts <b>in Babylonia.</b> Since it is not common for these animals to eat those animals, these acts are classified as Goring, irrespective of the fact that the animal gained pleasure from the damage, for which it would normally be classified in the category of Eating. Therefore, in cases where these animals had not performed this act of damaging before, and were therefore considered innocuous, the owner is liable for only half the cost of the damage, which is a fine. Since the collection of fines may be imposed only by judges who have been ordained, and ordination is given only in Eretz Yisrael, these payments are not collected in Babylonia.
The Gemara adds: <b>And this matter</b> applies only <b>where</b> they attacked <b>large</b> animals, as it is atypical behavior for them; <b>but where</b> they attacked <b>small</b> animals, since that <b>is their</b> typical <b>manner</b> of behavior, it is classified as Eating, for which the owner pays the full cost of the damage, which is certainly considered monetary restitution. Accordingly, the payment is collected by the courts in Babylonia.
<b>And</b> even in a case where the payment is considered a fine, <b>if</b> the injured party <b>seized</b> the property of the owner of the belligerent animal in order to cover his loss, <b>we do not reclaim</b> it <b>from him</b> since he is entitled to it.
<b>And</b> also, <b>if</b> the injured party <b>said</b> to the court: <b>Fix a time for me to go to Eretz Yisrael</b> to present the case before ordained judges, <b>we fix</b> a time <b>for him</b> and require the owner of the belligerent animal to go to the court in Eretz Yisrael at that time. <b>And</b> if <b>he does not go, we excommunicate him</b> for disobeying the orders of the court.
<b>And either way, we excommunicate</b> the owner of the belligerent animal <b>until he removes the danger,</b> e.g., by killing the animal or otherwise neutralizing the danger.
The justification for this is <b>from</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Natan, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not raise a vicious dog in his house, and one may not set up an unstable ladder in his house? The verse states: “You shall not bring blood into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:8), i.e., one may not allow a hazardous situation or item to remain in one’s house. As long as the hazard remains, the owner is in violation of this verse and therefore the court may excommunicate him for failing to remove the danger.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>five</b> damage-causing acts that an animal can perform twice and remain <b>innocuous</b> even when its owner was warned each time to prevent it from doing so. After the third time, the animal is rendered forewarned. In such cases, the owner is liable to pay only half of the damages. <b>And</b> there are <b>five</b> damage-causing acts for which an animal is considered <b>forewarned,</b> at times even if it had never caused damage in that manner. In such cases the owner is liable to pay the full cost of the damage.
<b>An animal is not</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard to Goring, i.e., <b>not for goring</b> with its horns, <b>nor for pushing</b> with its body, <b>nor for biting, nor for crouching</b> upon items in order to damage them, <b>nor for kicking.</b> In these cases the animal is considered to be innocuous and its owner is liable for only half of the damages.
Concerning acts of damage performed with <b>the tooth,</b> the animal is considered <b>forewarned with regard to eating that which is fitting for it</b> to eat. Concerning acts of damage performed with <b>the foot,</b> the animal is considered <b>forewarned with regard to breaking</b> items <b>while walking. And</b> there is <b>a forewarned ox,</b> which gored three times and each time his owner was warned to safeguard his ox from doing so. <b>And</b> there is <b>an ox that causes damage</b> to the property of the injured party while <b>on the property of the injured</b> party. <b>And</b> there is <b>the person,</b> i.e., any damage done by a person. In all of these cases the one who caused the damage is considered to be forewarned, resulting in the obligation to pay the full cost of the damage.
The mishna presents the <i>halakha</i> for wild animals: <b>The wolf; the lion; the bear; the leopard; the <i>bardelas</i>,</b> the meaning of which the Gemara will discuss; <b>and the snake. These are</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> even if they had never previously caused damage. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: When these</b> animals <b>are domesticated they are not</b> considered <b>forewarned. But the snake is always</b> considered <b>forewarned.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in its latter clause: Concerning acts of damage performed with <b>the tooth,</b> the animal is considered <b>forewarned with regard to eating</b> that which is fitting for it to eat, we learn, <b>by inference, that we are dealing</b> throughout the mishna <b>with</b> cases of damage done <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, as one is exempt from liability for acts of damage classified as Eating if they occur in the public domain. <b>And</b> yet the first clause <b>teaches: An animal is not</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard to Goring. Stating that it is not forewarned indicates that the liability of its owner is limited only <b>with regard to paying the full</b> cost <b>of</b> the damage, <b>but</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> it that holds that when damage classified as Goring is done within the property of the injured party the owner of the belligerent animal is liable for only half of the damages? <b>It is the Rabbis, who say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of cases of <b>Goring</b> performed by an innocuous animal, which is <b>atypical</b> behavior, done <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, is that the owner of the ox <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
But then <b>say,</b> and try to explain accordingly, the next part of <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And</b> there is <b>a forewarned ox</b> that gored three times, and each time his owner was warned to safeguard his ox from doing so. <b>And</b> there is <b>an ox that causes damage</b> to the property of the injured party while <b>on the property of the injured</b> party. <b>And</b> there is <b>the person.</b> In these cases, the responsible party pays full damages. With this clause <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon, who says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of cases of <b>Goring</b> performed by an innocuous animal, which is <b>atypical,</b> done <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, is that the owner of the ox <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> even if the ox is innocuous.
The Gemara asks: Could it be that <b>the first</b> part of the latter <b>clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the <b>Rabbis and</b> the next part of <b>the latter clause is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: Large-toothed one, leave the mishna and follow after me</b> and my interpretation that <b>the first</b> part of the latter <b>clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the <b>Rabbis and</b> the next part of <b>the latter clause is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon.</b>
The Gemara presents a different interpretation of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rav:</b>

Daf 16a

The <b>entire</b> mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon; the first</b> part of the latter <b>clause</b> is stated <b>with regard to</b> a jointly owned <b>courtyard,</b> which under the terms of their partnership is <b>designated for</b> the use of <b>one of them,</b> i.e., the injured party, <b>to</b> keep his <b>produce</b> there, <b>and for this</b> one <b>and for that</b> one <b>to</b> keep their <b>oxen</b> there. Accordingly, <b>with regard to</b> damage of the category of <b>Eating</b> caused by one partner’s ox to the injured party’s produce in that courtyard, <b>it is</b> equivalent to the case of <b>a courtyard</b> owned exclusively by <b>the injured</b> party, and the ox’s owner is liable for all the damage. <b>But with regard to</b> damage of the category of <b>Goring,</b> since they are both allowed to keep oxen there, the courtyard <b>is</b> equivalent to <b>a public domain,</b> and if one’s innocuous ox causes damage there, one is liable for only half the cost of the damage.
<b>Rav Kahana said: I stated this teaching</b> of Rabbi Elazar <b>before Rav Zevid of Neharde’a, and he said to me: Are you</b> really <b>able to interpret</b> that <b>the entire</b> mishna <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon? But doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach:</b> Concerning acts of damage performed with <b>the tooth,</b> the animal is considered <b>forewarned with regard to eating that which is fitting for it</b> to eat. This indicates that only if what it eats <b>is fitting for it,</b> then <b>yes,</b> one is liable for the full cost of the damage, but if it eats something <b>that is not fitting for it,</b> the owner would <b>not</b> be liable for the full cost of the damage, but only for half the cost of the damage.
Rav Kahana explains his difficulty: <b>And if</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon,</b> the owner should be liable to pay the full cost of the damage even if his animal ate something not fitting for it, as <b>doesn’t</b> Rabbi Tarfon <b>say:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of cases of <b>Goring</b> performed by an innocuous animal, which is <b>atypical,</b> done <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, is that the owner of the ox <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> even if the ox is innocuous.
<b>Rather,</b> Rav Kahana said: <b>Actually</b> it must be that the entire mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis and</b> the mishna <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> The opening clause should be understood as saying: There are <b>five</b> damage-causing acts that animals can perform twice and remain <b>innocuous, but if they were warned</b> for performing those acts three times, with regard to <b>the five</b> acts <b>they are</b> considered <b>forewarned,</b> i.e., the mishna is not referring to two different sets of damages, five acts for which the animal is considered innocuous and five for which it is considered forewarned. Rather, both statements in the initial clause of the mishna are referring to the same five acts of Goring, and they teach that although the animal is initially considered innocuous with regard to these five acts, it can become forewarned.
The next part of the mishna then provides another <i>halakha</i>: <b>But</b> for damage of the categories of <b>Eating and Trampling,</b> an animal is considered <b>forewarned from the outset.</b> The next two items in the mishna: A forewarned ox and an ox that causes damage on the property of the injured party, should be understood as a question and an answer: <b>And where</b> does <b>their forewarned status</b> with regard to these acts apply? It applies <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party. According to Rav Kahana’s explanation, the statement: In the courtyard of the injured party, refers only to cases of Eating or Trampling, not to acts classified as Goring, and therefore it is true even according to the opinion of the Rabbis.
<b>Ravina objects to this</b> explanation: <b>Doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>below</b> (24b) <b>teach:</b> With regard to the case of <b>an ox that causes damage</b> to the property of the injured party <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, stated in the mishna here (15b), <b>how so,</b> i.e., what are the circumstances in which one is liable to pay the full cost of the damage? The mishna below (24b) proceeds to list acts of damage classified as Goring. Ravina states his objection: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the mishna here (15b) <b>discusses that</b> case, i.e., that it is referring to Goring, it is <b>due to that</b> ruling that the mishna below <b>teaches: How so,</b> and proceeds to discuss one’s liability for Goring, as it is elucidating the case mentioned in the mishna here. <b>But if you say,</b> as Rav Zevid suggests, that the mishna here (15b) <b>does not discuss</b> Goring, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the mishna below when it asks: <b>How so,</b> and then proceeds to discuss one’s liability for Goring?
<b>Rather, Ravina said:</b> The mishna <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> There are <b>five</b> damage-causing acts that animals can perform twice and remain <b>innocuous, but if they were warned</b> for performing those acts three times with regard to <b>the five</b> acts, <b>they are</b> considered <b>forewarned.</b>
The next part of the mishna then provides another <i>halakha</i>: <b>But</b> for damage of the categories of <b>Eating and Trampling,</b> an animal is considered <b>forewarned from the outset, and this is</b> a case in which all agree that the animal is classified as <b>a forewarned ox. And</b> there is the case of <b>an ox that causes damage</b> to the property of the injured party, <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, which <b>is</b> subject to <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Tarfon and the Rabbis. And there are other</b> cases <b>similar to these</b> in which animals are considered <b>forewarned</b> from the outset, namely: <b>The wolf, the lion, the bear, the leopard, the <i>bardelas</i>, and the snake.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>This</b> interpretation of the mishna <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There are <b>five</b> damage-causing acts that animals can perform twice and remain <b>innocuous, but if they were warned</b> for performing those acts three times with regard to <b>the five</b> acts, <b>they are</b> considered <b>forewarned.</b> The next part of the mishna then provides another <i>halakha</i>: <b>But</b> for damage of the categories of <b>Eating and Trampling,</b> an animal is considered <b>forewarned from the outset, and this is</b> a case in which all agree that the animal is classified as <b>a forewarned ox. And</b> there is the case of <b>an ox that causes damage</b> to the property of the injured party, <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, which <b>is</b> subject to <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Tarfon and the Rabbis. And there are other</b> cases <b>similar to these</b> in which animals are considered <b>forewarned</b> from the outset, namely: <b>The wolf, the lion, the bear, the leopard, the <i>bardelas</i>, and the snake.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who raise</b> this issue <b>as a contradiction</b> and through doing so arrived at the same conclusions, as follows: <b>We learned</b> in the opening clause of the mishna: There are <b>five</b> damage-causing acts that animals can perform twice and remain <b>innocuous, and</b> there are <b>five</b> damage-causing acts for which an animal is considered <b>forewarned.</b> With regard to this, one can ask: <b>But is there nothing else? But aren’t there</b> the cases mentioned in the continuation of the mishna: <b>The wolf, the lion, the bear, the leopard, the <i>bardelas</i>, and the snake?</b> These are considered to be forewarned even if they had never caused damage before.
<b>And</b> they <b>resolve</b> the contradiction through that which <b>Ravina said:</b> The mishna <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> There are <b>five</b> damage-causing acts that animals can perform twice and remain <b>innocuous, but if they were warned</b> for performing those acts three times with regard to <b>the five</b> acts, <b>they are</b> considered <b>forewarned.</b> The next part of the mishna then provides another <i>halakha</i>: <b>But</b> for damage of the categories of <b>Eating and Trampling,</b> an animal is considered <b>forewarned from the outset, and this is</b> a case in which all agree that the animal is classified as <b>a forewarned ox. And</b> there is the case of <b>an ox that causes damage</b> to the property of the injured party, <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, which <b>is</b> subject to <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Tarfon and the Rabbis. And there are other</b> cases <b>similar to these</b> in which animals are considered <b>forewarned</b> from the outset, namely: <b>The wolf, the lion, the bear, the leopard, the <i>bardelas</i>, and the snake.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: An animal is not considered forewarned with regard to Goring, i.e., not for goring with its horns, nor for pushing with its body, nor for biting, <b>nor for crouching</b> upon items in order to damage them. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to <b>large vessels,</b> as it is atypical for an animal to crouch upon them, and therefore the act is classified as a subcategory of Goring. <b>But</b> if the animal cr0uched upon <b>small vessels,</b> since that <b>is its</b> typical <b>manner</b> of behavior, it is classified as a subcategory of Trampling, for which the animal is considered forewarned from the outset.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> the opinion of Rabbi Elazar: <b>An animal is</b> considered <b>forewarned,</b> from the outset, <b>to walk in its</b> typical <b>manner and to break or crush a person, or an animal, or vessels.</b> The <i>baraita</i> indicates that an animal’s typical manner is to crush vessels, presumably by crouching down upon them. This would seem to contradict the mishna that states that such behavior is atypical. It would appear the only resolution to this contradiction is if one accepts the distinction made by Rabbi Elazar that the mishna concerns large vessels and the <i>baraita</i> concerns small vessels.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>baraita</i> concerns a case where the animal pushed against the utensils <b>from the side</b> and crushed them against a wall, but it does not concern a case where it crouched upon them.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this discussion, as follows: <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Do not say</b> that the mishna’s ruling refers only to <b>large vessels, as it is atypical</b> for an animal to crouch upon them, <b>but</b> if the animal crouched upon <b>small vessels,</b> that <b>is its</b> typical <b>manner</b> and for that type of damage the animal is considered forewarned. <b>Rather,</b> the mishna refers <b>even</b> to <b>small vessels, as it is atypical</b> for an animal to crouch upon them.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: An animal is considered forewarned, from the outset, to walk in its typical manner and to break <b>or crush a person, or an animal, or vessels.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: Perhaps</b> the <i>baraita</i> concerns only a case where the animal pushed against the utensils <b>from the side</b> and crushed them against a wall.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who raise</b> this issue <b>as a contradiction: We learned</b> in the mishna: An animal is not considered forewarned with regard to Goring, i.e., not for goring with its horns, nor for pushing with its body, nor for biting, <b>nor for crouching</b> upon items in order to damage them. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: An animal is considered forewarned, from the outset, to walk in its typical manner and to break <b>or crush a person, or an animal, or vessels?</b> In order to resolve this contradiction, <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> It is <b>not difficult; here,</b> in the mishna, the reference is to <b>large vessels,</b> while <b>there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, the reference is to <b>small vessels.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>The wolf, the lion,</b> the bear, the leopard, the <i>bardelas</i>, and the snake; these are considered to be forewarned even if they had never caused damage before. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>a <i>bardelas</i>? Rav Yehuda said:</b> It is <b>a <i>nafreza</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>a <i>nafreza</i>? Rav Yosef said:</b> It is <b>an <i>appa</i>.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In addition to the list of animals that are considered forewarned, <b>Rabbi Meir says: Also the hyena [<i>tzavo’a</i>]. Rabbi Elazar says: Also the snake. And Rav Yosef said</b> in explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: The <b>hyena</b> mentioned by Rabbi Meir, <b>this is</b> the animal called <b>an <i>appa</i>.</b> If Rav Yosef understands a hyena to be an <i>appa</i>, how could he also claim, above, that it is a <i>bardelas</i>?
The Gemara explains: It is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Meir is <b>referring to a male hyena,</b> and <b>there,</b> in the mishna, the reference is to <b>a female hyena.</b>
And it is apparent that a male hyena is distinct from a female one, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A male hyena after seven years metamorphoses into an insectivorous bat [<i>atalef</i> ]; an insectivorous bat after seven years metamorphoses into a herbivorous bat [<i>arpad</i>]; a herbivorous bat after seven years metamorphoses into a thistle [<i>kimosh</i>]; a thistle after seven years metamorphoses into a briar [<i>ḥo’aḥ</i>];</b> and <b>a briar after seven years metamorphoses into a demon.</b> Similarly, <b>a person’s spine, seven years after</b> his death, <b>metamorphoses into a snake.</b> The Gemara qualifies the last statement: <b>And this matter applies</b> only to a case <b>where</b> that person <b>did not bow during</b> the blessing of <b>thanksgiving,</b> the eighteenth blessing of the <i>Amida</i> prayer.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master says</b> above: In addition to the list of animals that are considered forewarned, <b>Rabbi Meir says: Also the hyena.</b>

Daf 16b

<b>Rabbi Elazar says: Also the snake.</b> By using the term also, Rabbi Elazar suggests he considers a snake to be forewarned to the same extent as the other animals in the mishna’s list, which, according to his opinion, are not considered to be forewarned if they are domesticated. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Elazar says: When these</b> animals <b>are domesticated they are not</b> considered to be <b>forewarned, but the snake is always</b> considered <b>forewarned?</b>
The Gemara answers: Emend and <b>teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> as saying that Rabbi Elazar says: <b>A snake,</b> instead of saying: Also a snake. Accordingly, the <i>baraita</i> is teaching that he holds that only a snake is considered to be forewarned under all circumstances because he holds that even if it is domesticated it is still prone to caused damage.
§ The Gemara considers cases of damage caused by a lion: <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a lion</b> that kills an animal <b>in the public domain,</b> if <b>it clawed</b> its prey <b>and ate</b> it, the lion’s owner is <b>exempt</b> from liability. But if it first <b>tore apart</b> its prey with its teeth in order to kill it, <b>and</b> only then <b>ate</b> it, the owner is <b>liable</b> for the damage.
The Gemara elucidates: If <b>it clawed</b> its prey <b>and ate</b> it, the owner is <b>exempt, since it is its</b> typical <b>manner to claw</b> its prey and eat it, and <b>it is</b> therefore <b>equivalent to</b> the case of an animal <b>that eats fruit and vegetables</b> belonging to someone else. Therefore, <b>it is</b> classified as <b>Eating</b> done <b>in a public domain, and</b> the owner of the lion is <b>exempt.</b> But if the lion first <b>tore apart</b> its prey to kill it, since this <b>is not its</b> typical <b>manner,</b> the act is classified as Goring, for which an owner is liable even in a public thoroughfare.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that tearing apart</b> its prey <b>is not the</b> typical <b>manner of</b> a lion? <b>But isn’t it written: “The lion tears apart for its young,</b> and it strangles for its lionesses, and it fills its caves with prey, and its den with that which was torn apart” (Nahum 2:13). The description in the verse clearly indicates that it is the typical manner of a lion to tear apart its prey. The Gemara answers that each phrase of this verse is referring not to a situation where the lion catches prey for its own immediate use, but to one where it provides food <b>for its young,</b> as it says: “The lion tears apart for its young”; to provide food <b>for its lionesses: “And it strangles for its lionesses”;</b> to provide food <b>for</b> the young cubs in <b>its lair: “And it filled its lair with prey”;</b> and to provide food <b>for</b> the young cubs in <b>its den: “And its den with that which was torn apart.”</b> Therefore, we cannot learn from this verse that it is the typical manner of a lion to tear apart prey for its own immediate use.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning acts classified as Eating: <b>And similarly,</b> in the case of <b>a wild animal,</b> including a lion, <b>that entered the courtyard of the injured</b> party <b>and tore apart</b> the courtyard owner’s <b>animal and ate</b> its <b>meat,</b> the owner of the wild animal <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where it tore apart</b> the animal in order <b>to leave it</b> for later consumption. Since this is typical behavior for a lion, the lion is considered forewarned with regard to it. The Gemara asks: <b>Doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach:</b> And <b>ate</b> its meat? The Gemara answers: This is a case <b>where</b> the lion initially killed the animal to leave it for later consumption but then <b>reconsidered and ate</b> it.
The Gemara questions this understanding: <b>How can we know</b> what the animal’s initial intentions were? <b>And furthermore,</b> if one accepts this claim, then the ruling <b>of Shmuel</b> is <b>also</b> called into question, as <b>perhaps</b> the case he ruled on <b>is</b> a case like <b>this,</b> where the lion initially intended to leave the prey he killed for later consumption, and therefore the owner should be exempt. The Gemara therefore rejects this understanding.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> two cases <b>disjunctively</b> and should be understood as teaching two <i>halakhot</i>: With regard to a lion <b>that tore apart</b> an animal in order <b>to leave</b> it for later consumption, <b>or</b> a lion that <b>clawed</b> its prey <b>and ate</b> it, since each acted in the typical manner of a lion, the owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
<b>Ravina said:</b> It is the typical manner of a wild lion to kill its prey and then eat it, and therefore such damage is classified as Eating. Accordingly, if the damage was done in the public domain, the lion’s owner is exempt from any liability. <b>When Shmuel says</b> that an owner is liable if his lion does so, that was <b>with regard to a domesticated lion and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, who says it is not the</b> typical <b>manner</b> of a domesticated wild animal to attack. Accordingly, the act is classified as being of the category of Goring, for which one is liable even in a public thoroughfare.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even</b> when the lion <b>clawed</b> its prey and ate it, the owner <b>should be liable</b> for any damage it causes in a public domain, since according to Rabbi Elazar such behavior is atypical for a domesticated lion. Why then does Shmuel rule that in such a case the owner is exempt?
The Gemara concedes that its presentation of Ravina’s opinion is untenable: <b>Rather, Ravina’s</b> explanation <b>was not stated in reference to Shmuel’s</b> ruling, but <b>rather in reference to the <i>baraita</i>,</b> cited above, that discusses a case where a lion causes damage in the courtyard of the injured party. Accordingly, Ravina’s statement should be understood as follows: <b>When the <i>baraita</i> teaches</b> that one is liable if one’s lion tore apart an animal and ate it, that was <b>with regard to a domesticated lion and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar, who says it is not the</b> typical <b>manner</b> of a domesticated wild animal to attack.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> since the act is atypical behavior for a lion, it should be classified as Goring, and the owner should be <b>required to pay</b> for only <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the lion <b>was forewarned.</b>
The Gemara questions further: <b>If that is so, what</b> is the reason <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches this among</b> the <b>subcategories of Eating? It should have taught it among</b> the <b>subcategories of Goring.</b> The Gemara concedes: This is <b>a difficulty</b> with this explanation.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the liability incurred for damage caused by an ox that is considered <b>innocuous and</b> the liability incurred for damage caused by an ox that is <b>forewarned?</b>
The <b>only</b> differences are <b>that</b> for damage caused by <b>an innocuous</b> ox, the owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> exclusively <b>from</b> proceeds of the sale <b>of the body</b> of the ox, <b>and</b> for <b>a forewarned</b> ox <b>he pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage from</b> his <b>higher</b> property.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> does the mishna mean by saying he pays from his <b>higher [<i>aliyya</i>]</b> property? <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> It means that he pays <b>with the superior-quality [<i>bame’ulla</i>]</b> items <b>of his property.</b>
<b>And similarly,</b> the fact that the word <i>aliyya</i> is referring to superior-quality property is indicated by the verse that <b>states: “And Hezekiah lay with his ancestors, and they buried him in the best [<i>bema’ale</i>] of the sepulchers of the descendants of David”</b> (II Chronicles 32:33), <b>and Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The term <b><i>bema’ale</i></b> means <b>beside the best of the family. And who are they? David and Solomon.</b>
The Gemara offers an interpretation of another verse about the burial of a king of Judea, King Asa: <b>“And they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had hewn out for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the resting place, which was filled with perfumes and spices [<i>zenim</i>]</b> prepared by the perfumers’ art” (II Chronicles 16:14). <b>What</b> is meant by <b>“perfumes and spices”? Rabbi Elazar says:</b> It means <b>many</b> different <b>types [<i>zinei</i>]</b> of perfumes. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says:</b> The word <i>zenim</i> sounds similar to the word <i>zenut</i>, licentiousness, and should therefore be understood about types of <b>perfumes that anyone who smells them is led to licentiousness.</b>
The Gemara cites another dispute between Rabbi Elazar and Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: Jeremiah requested of God to punish those who hounded him: <b>“For they have dug a pit to trap me and they have set snares for my feet”</b> (Jeremiah 18:22). In what way did they dig a pit to trap him? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: They cast suspicion upon him of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>a woman who had engaged in sexual intercourse with a man forbidden to her by the Torah [<i>zona</i>]. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says: They cast suspicion upon him of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>a married woman.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says that they cast suspicion upon him of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>a <i>zona</i>, this is</b> because the word “pit” is used as a metaphor for a <i>zona</i>, <b>as it is written: “For a <i>zona</i> is a deep pit”</b> (Proverbs 23:27). <b>But according to the one who says that they cast suspicion upon him</b> of engaging in intercourse with <b>a married woman,</b> for <b>what</b> reason did Jeremiah use the word <b>“pit”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Due to</b> the fact that she is <b>a married woman, should she be excluded from the category of a <i>zona</i>?</b> If she commits adultery she is also termed a <i>zona</i>, and the term “pit” can justifiably be applied to her.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who says that they cast suspicion upon him of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>a married woman, this is</b> consistent with <b>that which is written: “You, Lord, know all their plans to kill me”</b> (Jeremiah 18:23). By claiming he engaged in intercourse with a married woman, they implicated him in a prohibition punishable by the death penalty. <b>But according to the one who says that they suspected him of</b> engaging in intercourse with <b>a <i>zona</i>, what</b> did he mean by saying <b>“to kill</b> me” when there is no court-imposed capital punishment for doing so? The Gemara answers: Jeremiah was referring to the fact <b>that they cast him into a pit of mire.</b>
<b>Rava interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Let them be made to stumble before You; deal with them in the time of Your anger”</b> (Jeremiah 18:23)? It means that <b>Jeremiah said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, even at a time when they</b> try to <b>perform</b> acts of <b>charity, make them stumble</b> by ensuring that they do so <b>with people who are unworthy</b> of charity <b>in order that they should not receive</b> the <b>reward for</b> helping <b>them.</b>
The Gemara, above, cited a verse concerning King Hezekiah’s burial. The Gemara cites the continuation of that verse: <b>“And they afforded him honor in his death”</b> (II Chronicles 32:33). This <b>teaches that they established a yeshiva at his grave</b> to study Torah there.
<b>Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis disagree</b> with regard to this yeshiva: <b>One said:</b> They studied there for <b>three</b> days.

Daf 17a

<b>And</b> the other <b>one said:</b> They studied there for <b>seven</b> days. <b>And some say</b> they studied there for <b>thirty</b> days.
<b>The Sages taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that offers another interpretation of the verse cited: <b>“And afforded him [<i>lo</i>] honor in his death”</b> (II Chronicles 32:33). <b>This</b> is referring to the honor given to <b>Hezekiah, king of Judea, that</b> at his burial <b>36,000</b> men with <b>bared shoulders went out before him.</b> They removed their robes from their shoulders as a sign of mourning. The number 36,000 is alluded to by the numerical value of the word <i>lo</i>, which is thirty-six. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: But didn’t they</b> also <b>do this before Ahab?</b> Apparently, if they did this for the wicked king Ahab, it is an honor shown to all kings, and it is was not a unique show of honor for the righteous Hezekiah.
<b>Rather,</b> the honor that was done for Hezekiah was <b>that they laid a Torah scroll upon his bier and they said: This one,</b> i.e., Hezekiah, <b>fulfilled that which is written in this,</b> i.e., the Torah scroll.
The Gemara asks: <b>But nowadays as well, we do this</b> for any great Torah scholar that dies, so what is unique about what was done to honor Hezekiah? The Gemara answers: Nowadays, <b>we take</b> a Torah scroll <b>out</b> but <b>we do not lay</b> it on the bier of the deceased. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that nowadays <b>we also lay</b> a Torah scroll on the bier of the deceased; but <b>we do not say:</b> This one <b>fulfilled</b> that which is written in this.
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: I was</b> once <b>walking together with Rabbi Yoḥanan to ask</b> him about this <b>statement. Whenever he would enter a lavatory,</b> upon his exit <b>I would ask him</b> to explain <b>a matter,</b> and <b>he would not answer us until he had washed his hands and donned his phylacteries and made</b> the <b>blessing, and</b> only <b>then would he answer us.</b> With regard to the honor given to King Hezekiah, he said: Nowadays, <b>we even say:</b> This one <b>fulfilled</b> that which is written in this, but <b>we do not say: He taught</b> that which is written in this, which was a unique honor performed at the burial of the righteous King Hezekiah.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t the Master say: Torah study is great because</b> the <b>study</b> of Torah <b>leads to</b> one’s <b>performance</b> of the mitzvot? This indicates that the performance of mitzvot is considered of greater value than Torah study. If so, once Hezekiah had been praised with the fact that he fulfilled the mitzvot of the Torah, why mention that he studied it? The Gemara explains: This is <b>not difficult: This</b> statement of the Master is <b>about studying</b> the Torah for one’s own knowledge, and <b>that</b> unique praise given to King Hezekiah was <b>about teaching</b> the Torah to others.
§ A verse that was cited at the beginning of the this chapter (2b) as part of a halakhic exposition is now explained homiletically: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Happy are you that sow beside all waters, that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20)? It teaches that <b>whoever engages in</b> the study of <b>Torah and in</b> the performance of <b>acts of kindness merits</b> reward equal to <b>the portion of two tribes,</b> Joseph and Issachar.
The Gemara explains how this is derived from the verse: <b>As it is stated: “Happy are you that sow.” And</b> the reference to <b>sowing</b> refers <b>only</b> to acts of <b>charity, as it is stated: “Sow for yourselves for charity, reap according to kindness”</b> (Hosea 10:12). <b>And</b> the reference to <b>water</b> refers <b>only</b> to the study of <b>Torah, as it is stated</b> with regard to Torah study: <b>“Ho, all who are thirsty, go to water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1).
<b>And</b> the fact that <b>he merits</b> reward equal to <b>the portion of two tribes</b> is derived as follows: The reference to the ox in the verse is an allusion to Joseph, who is described as an ox (Deuteronomy 33:17), and one’s reward is that <b>he merits to</b> receive <b>a canopy</b> of honor, <b>as</b> did <b>Joseph, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful vine,</b> a fruitful vine by a fountain; <b>its branches run over the wall.”</b> The branches over the wall in this verse allude to the canopy. <b>And</b> the reference to the donkey is an allusion to the fact that <b>he merits</b> to receive <b>the portion of Issachar,</b> who is described as a donkey, <b>as it is stated: “Issachar is a large-boned donkey”</b> (Genesis 49:14).
<b>There are</b> some <b>who say</b> that the comparison should be understood in a different manner. <b>His enemies will fall before him</b> just <b>like</b> in the blessing given by Moses to the tribe of <b>Joseph, as it is written</b> in the blessing bestowed by Moses to the tribe of Joseph: “His horns are the horns of the wild-ox; <b>with them he shall gore the nations, even to the ends of the earth”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:17). <b>And he merits the understanding of Issachar, as it is written: “And of the children of Issachar, men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do”</b> (I Chronicles 12:33).

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna in the previous chapter (15b) teaches that the owner of an animal is always forewarned with regard to the category of Trampling. The mishna elaborates: For <b>what</b> damage caused with <b>the hoof</b> is the animal deemed <b>forewarned?</b> It is deemed forewarned with regard <b>to</b> trampling objects and <b>breaking</b> them <b>in the course of its walking. An animal is</b> deemed <b>forewarned with regard to walking in its</b> typical <b>manner and,</b> by doing so, <b>breaking</b> objects as it proceeds.
By contrast, if the animal <b>was kicking</b> while it was walking, <b>or</b> it transpired <b>that pebbles were</b> inadvertently <b>propelled from under its feet and</b> those pebbles <b>broke vessels,</b> cases of that kind do not fit precisely into the primary category of Trampling. In both of these cases the owner of the animal <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b> If an animal <b>trod upon a vessel and broke it and</b> then a shard of that vessel <b>fell upon</b> a second <b>vessel and broke it,</b> the owner <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage for the first</b> vessel, as its action is classified under the primary category of Trampling, <b>and he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage for the latter</b> vessel, as the damage caused by the shard is tantamount to damage caused by pebbles inadvertently propelled by the foot of an animal.
<b>Chickens are</b> deemed <b>forewarned</b> with regard <b>to walking in their</b> typical <b>manner and breaking</b> objects, and therefore, the owner of a chicken pays the full restitution for the damage done to any objects broken by his chicken. If there <b>was a string [<i>delil</i>] tied to</b> a chicken’s <b>leg</b> as an indication of ownership and it wrapped around a vessel and broke it, <b>or</b> if the chicken <b>was hopping</b> in an atypical manner <b>and breaking vessels,</b> its owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>

Daf 17b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <b>Ravina said to Rava:</b> In the context of the category of Trampling, damage caused by an animal trampling an object with its <b>foot is the same as</b> damage caused by <b>an animal</b> breaking an object with its body. Why does the mishna repeat the same <i>halakha</i> twice? Rava <b>said to him:</b> First, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the <b>primary categories</b> of damage, namely the category of Trampling with an animal’s foot, which is mentioned explicitly in the Torah, <b>and</b> then <b>he teaches</b> the <b>subcategories</b> of those primary categories, i.e., the animal is deemed forewarned with regard to causing damage with other parts of its body in the course of its walking.
Ravina challenges this explanation: <b>If that is so, the latter clause</b> of the mishna (19b), <b>which teaches,</b> concerning the primary category of Eating: For what damage caused by <b>Eating</b> is the animal deemed <b>forewarned?</b> It is deemed forewarned with regard to eating food items fit for its consumption, i.e., <b>the animal is</b> deemed <b>forewarned</b> with regard to eating fruits and vegetables. Ravina asks: <b>What primary categories and what subcategories are there</b> in that context? No subcategories of Eating are enumerated there, and nevertheless, the phrase: The animal is deemed forewarned, is repeated. Rava <b>responded to</b> Ravina <b>with a humorous</b> response <b>and said to him: I resolved</b> the difficulty in <b>one</b> mishna, now <b>you resolve</b> the difficulty in <b>one</b> mishna.
<b>And what is the reason</b> for the apparent redundancy in the mishna with regard to Eating? <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> First the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>Eating by an undomesticated animal and</b> then <b>he teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>Eating by a domesticated animal.</b> And it was necessary to state both, as <b>it enters your mind to say</b> that since <b>it is written: “And he set his animal loose”</b> (Exodus 22:4), with regard to <b>domesticated animals, yes,</b> the primary category of Eating applies, but with regard to <b>undomesticated animals, no,</b> the primary category of Eating does not apply. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us that undomesticated animals</b> are included <b>in the category of domesticated animals</b> in this regard and the owner of an undomesticated animal is liable for damage caused by his animal eating another person’s produce.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a domesticated animal <b>first</b> and only afterward taught the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an undomesticated animal, as the latter is included in the category of the former. The Gemara answers: On the contrary, <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>which is derived from an interpretation, is dear to him,</b> and therefore the <i>tanna</i> preferred to begin with the derived <i>halakha</i> and only then proceed to the explicit <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then with regard to the <b>first clause,</b> in this mishna <b>too, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach that which is not</b> explicitly <b>written first,</b> as that which is derived from an interpretation is dear to him. The Gemara distinguishes between the cases: <b>How can</b> they <b>be compared? There,</b> with regard to Eating, <b>this</b> damage caused by a domesticated animal <b>and that</b> damage caused by an undomesticated animal <b>are primary categories</b> of damage; therefore, the <i>tanna</i> taught first <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>which is derived from an interpretation, is dear to him.</b> But <b>here,</b> with regard to Trampling, would <b>he leave aside the primary category</b> of Trampling, done with the animal’s foot, <b>and teach a subcategory</b> first?
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead that the reason that in this mishna the <i>tanna</i> begins with that which is written explicitly in the Torah and only then proceeds to teach that which is derived through an interpretation is as follows: <b>Since</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>concluded</b> the discussion in the final mishna in the previous chapter (15b) <b>with</b> the primary category of <b>Trampling</b> by teaching the clause: The foot of an animal is deemed forewarned with regard to trampling objects and breaking them in the course of its walking, therefore, <b>he began</b> the first mishna in the second chapter <b>with</b> the primary category of <b>Trampling.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught: An animal is</b> deemed <b>forewarned</b> with regard <b>to walking in its</b> typical <b>manner and,</b> while doing so, <b>breaking</b> objects in the course of its walking. <b>How so?</b> If <b>an animal entered into the courtyard of the injured</b> party <b>and it damaged</b> an object <b>with its body</b> in <b>the course of its walking; or</b> if it caused damage <b>with its hair</b> in <b>the course of its walking; or with the saddle that is on it; or with the</b> packed <b>saddlebag [<i>shalif</i> ] that is on it; or with the halter in its mouth; or with the bell [<i>zog</i>] around its neck; or</b> if it was <b>a donkey</b> that caused damage <b>with its burden;</b> in all these cases the owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage. Sumakhos says:</b> In the case of <b>pebbles</b> propelled by an animal in the course of its walking, <b>or</b> in the case of <b>a pig that was burrowing in the garbage heap and caused damage,</b> the owner of the animal <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
The Gemara asks: If a pig <b>caused damage,</b> it <b>is obvious</b> that its owner must pay the full cost of the damage. What novel element is Sumakhos introducing? The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, say:</b> If <b>it propelled</b> pebbles <b>and</b> thereby <b>caused damage,</b> the owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Pebbles, who mentioned anything about it?</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> For damage caused <b>by pebbles</b> that were propelled by animals walking <b>in their typical manner,</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage, and</b> for damage caused by <b>a pig that was burrowing in the garbage heap and propelled</b> pebbles <b>and</b> that <b>damaged</b> an object, its owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage. Sumakhos says:</b> Both in the case of <b>pebbles</b> that were propelled <b>and</b> in the case of <b>a pig that was burrowing in the garbage heap and propelled</b> pebbles <b>and damaged</b> an object, the owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b> Sumakhos does not accept the <i>halakha</i> that the owner pays only half the cost of the damage caused by pebbles inadvertently propelled by the foot of an animal in the course of its walking, i.e., in its typical manner. He holds that since the damage results from the animal’s typical behavior, the owner pays the full cost of the damage.
<b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:1): If <b>chickens were flying from place to place and broke vessels with their wings,</b> their owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> as this is a subcategory of Trampling. By contrast, if the damage was caused <b>by the wind</b> generated <b>by their wings,</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> in the case of pebbles. <b>Sumakhos says:</b> The owner pays <b>the full</b> cost of the <b>damage. It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: If <b>chickens were hopping upon dough or upon produce and they sullied</b> it with their feet, <b>or</b> if <b>they pecked</b> at it and caused damage, their owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage. If</b> in the course of their hopping <b>they stirred up dust or</b> propelled <b>pebbles,</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage. Sumakhos says:</b> He pays <b>the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a chicken was flying from place to place and wind emerged from beneath its wings and</b> the wind <b>caused vessels to break,</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b> The Gemara notes: This <b>unattributed</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Sumakhos and hold that the owner pays half the cost of the damage in these cases, just as he does in the case of pebbles propelled by the feet of an animal.
<b>Rava</b> analyzed the <i>baraita</i> and <b>said: Granted,</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos</b> is understood, as <b>he holds</b> that the status of damage resulting from <b>a force</b> generated by the animal’s action <b>is like</b> that of damage directly caused by the animal <b>itself,</b> and therefore the owner pays the full cost of the damage in both cases. <b>But</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> is difficult, as <b>if</b> they hold that the status of damage resulting from <b>a force</b> generated by the animal’s action <b>is like</b> that of damage directly caused by the animal <b>itself,</b> the owner should <b>be required to pay the full</b> cost of the <b>damage. And if</b> they hold that the status of damage resulting from <b>a force</b> generated by the animal’s action <b>is not like</b> that of damage directly caused by the animal <b>itself,</b> and is not attributed to the animal, then the owner should not be required <b>to pay even half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
<b>Then Rava said: Actually,</b> the Rabbis hold that the status of damage resulting from a force generated by the animal’s action <b>is like</b> that of damage directly caused by the animal <b>itself,</b> and in principle the owner should be required to pay the full cost of the damage. <b>And</b> the liability to pay for <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> caused by <b>pebbles</b> is because the Rabbis <b>learned this <i>halakha</i> through tradition,</b> and it does not correspond to the standard <i>halakhot</i> of damages.
§ <b>Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> type of action <b>which,</b> when <b>a <i>zav</i></b> interacts with a vessel in that manner, he renders it <b>ritually impure,</b> if the same type of action was done by an animal, resulting <b>in damage,</b> the owner of the animal is liable to <b>pay the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b> Conversely, with regard to <b>any</b> type of action <b>which,</b> when <b>a <i>zav</i></b> interacts with a vessel in that manner, he leaves it <b>ritually pure,</b> e.g., where the contact is indirect, if the same type of action was done by an animal, resulting <b>in damage,</b> the owner of the animal is liable to <b>pay</b> only <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rava, did he come to teach us</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>pebbles?</b> The substance of Rava’s statement is that for damage caused by the indirect action of an animal, its owner pays half the cost of the damage. That is identical to the <i>halakha</i> of pebbles articulated in the <i>baraitot</i> cited earlier. The Gemara answers: <b>No, Rava teaches us</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>a calf pulling a cart [<i>karon</i>].</b> Just as with regard to a <i>zav</i>, the status of a vessel that a <i>zav</i> moves is like that of a vessel with which he came into contact, so too, the status of damage caused by the cart pulled by the animal is like that of damage caused by the animal’s body, and it is not considered indirect damage like in the case of pebbles.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava: An animal is</b> deemed <b>forewarned with regard to breaking</b> objects <b>in the course of its walking. How so?</b> If <b>an animal entered into the courtyard of the injured</b> party, <b>and it damaged</b> an object <b>with its body</b> in <b>the course of its walking; or with its hair</b> in <b>the course of its walking; or with the saddle that is on it; or with the</b> packed <b>saddlebag that is on it; or with the halter that is in its mouth; or with the bell that is around its neck; or</b> if <b>a donkey</b> caused damage <b>with its burden; or</b> if <b>a calf</b> caused damage while <b>pulling a cart;</b> in all these cases the owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> In a case where <b>chickens were pecking at the rope</b> tied to <b>a bucket and the rope was severed and the bucket</b> fell and <b>broke,</b> their owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
<b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If an animal <b>trod upon a vessel but did not break it and</b> the vessel then <b>rolled to another place and broke</b> there, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rava elaborates: In determining one’s liability for causing damage, <b>do we follow the initial</b> action that ultimately led to the damage <b>and this</b> case is regarded as damage caused by the animal <b>itself?</b> Accordingly, the owner would pay the full cost of the damage as he would in any case classified under the primary category of Trampling. <b>Or perhaps</b> do <b>we follow the breaking of the vessel and</b> therefore <b>this</b> case is regarded as similar to the case of <b>pebbles</b> propelled by the foot of an animal in the course of its walking, since the vessel was not broken by a direct action of the animal, but rather, as an indirect result of the animal’s action?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Resolve</b> Rava’s dilemma <b>from</b> the statement <b>of Rabba, as Rabba says:</b> If one <b>threw a vessel from a roof and another came and broke it with a stick</b> as it was falling, the one who hit it with the stick is <b>exempt</b> from all liability <b>as we say to him</b> that <b>he broke a broken vessel.</b> From the moment the vessel was tossed from the roof it was inevitable that it would break. Consequently, breaking it with a stick as it was falling had no real effect. Apparently, the initial action is the decisive factor in determining liability for damages. The same should be the <i>halakha</i> in a case where a vessel was trod upon by an animal but it did not break, and the vessel then rolled to another place and broke there. The liability should be determined based on the initial action that caused the damage. The Gemara rejects this proof: The <i>halakha</i> in this case <b>is clear to Rabba,</b> who ruled as he did, but it remains <b>a dilemma to Rava.</b> One cannot prove the opinion of one <i>amora</i> from the opinion of another.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the resolution of this dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>hopping,</b> a chicken <b>is not</b> deemed <b>forewarned. And some say that it is forewarned.</b>
The Gemara questions the formulation of the <i>baraita</i>: Does it <b>enter your mind</b> to raise the possibility that a chicken is not forewarned with regard to <b>hopping?</b> Hopping is the typical manner of movement for chickens. <b>Rather, is it not</b> that the reference in the <i>baraita</i> is to a case where the chicken was <b>hopping and</b> the hopping <b>propelled</b> the vessel to roll to another place, and the vessel was broken there? <b>And they disagree with regard to this:</b> One <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>we follow the initial</b> action that ultimately led to the damage, and since hopping is typical manner of movement for a chicken, its owner is responsible for any damage that resulted from its hopping. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage holds: We follow the breaking of the vessel,</b> and since there was an additional factor that broke the vessel, the owner of the chicken is not liable.
The Gemara rejects the parallel between the dispute and the dilemma: <b>No,</b> the dispute in the <i>baraita</i> can be explained differently.

Daf 18a

The dispute concerns a case <b>where</b> the chicken <b>propelled pebbles</b> from underfoot as it was hopping, <b>and</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute of Sumakhos and the Rabbis,</b> cited earlier, that the <i>tanna’im</i> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>disagree.</b> One <i>tanna</i> holds that the owner pays the full cost of the damage for pebbles propelled by an animal in the course of its walking, and the other <i>tanna</i> holds that its owner pays half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an additional attempt to resolve the dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>chickens were pecking at the rope</b> tied to <b>a bucket and the rope was severed and the bucket</b> fell and <b>broke,</b> the owner of the chickens <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage. Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>we follow the initial</b> action that ultimately led to the damage in determining liability for damage. The Gemara rejects this conclusion, and one cannot adduce proof from the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Interpret</b> instead that the reference in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>to</b> the damage caused to <b>the rope,</b> while the owner pays only half the cost of the damage for breaking the bucket.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> eating <b>a rope atypical</b> behavior for a chicken, and therefore it should be classified within the primary category of Goring, not the primary category of Eating? Why then must the owner of the chicken pay the full cost of the damage? The Gemara answers: The reference in the <i>baraita</i> is to a case where the rope <b>was filthy [<i>ma’us</i>] with kneaded dough,</b> and in those circumstances it is typical for a chicken to peck at it. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: And the <b>bucket broke,</b> indicating that the dispute is with regard to damage done to the bucket, not to the rope? The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Sumakhos, who says:</b> In the case of <b>pebbles</b> propelled by an animal, the owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Sumakhos, say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>If a shard was propelled from</b> the bucket broken by a chicken <b>and it fell upon another vessel and broke it,</b> the owner of the chicken <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage for the first</b> vessel, <b>and half</b> the cost of <b>the damage for the second</b> one. <b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Sumakhos, is he of</b> the opinion that one pays <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> caused by pebbles?
<b>And if you would say</b> that there is <b>a difference, according to Sumakhos, between damage</b> resulting from <b>a force</b> generated by the animal’s action, e.g., pebbles, <b>and</b> damage caused <b>by a force</b> generated by <b>a force</b> generated by <b>its</b> action, e.g., damage caused by the shard of the bucket, and in the latter case Sumakhos concedes that the owner pays half the cost of the damage, that would result in a difficulty. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what of <b>this dilemma raised by Rav Ashi: According to</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos,</b> what is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to damage caused <b>by a force</b> generated by <b>a force</b> generated by the animal’s action? Is the status of that secondary force <b>like</b> that of damage caused by <b>a force</b> generated by <b>its</b> action, in which case the owner is liable, <b>or</b> is its status <b>not like</b> that of damage caused by <b>a force</b> generated by <b>its</b> action?
Why did Rav Ashi state his dilemma; why did he not <b>resolve</b> the dilemma and conclude that according to Sumakhos its status is <b>not like</b> that of damage caused by <b>a force</b> generated by <b>its</b> action? Since Rav Ashi does not resolve the dilemma based on this <i>baraita</i>, apparently, Sumakhos does not distinguish between the two types of force.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> so that this <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>that we follow the initial</b> action that ultimately led to the damage when determining one’s liability for the damage. Therefore, an owner is liable for any damage resulting from his animal’s typical behavior, and he pays the full cost of the damage done to the bucket even if the damage took place in another location.
<b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye said:</b> There is no proof from the <i>baraita</i>, as it could be explained that the reference in the <i>baraita</i> is to a case <b>where</b> the bucket is <b>continually</b> propelled <b>from</b> the impetus of the chicken, who caused the bucket to break. That is why the ruling in the <i>baraita</i> is that the owner of the chicken pays the full cost of the damage. The dilemma with regard to the case where an animal treads upon a vessel that rolls away and breaks elsewhere remains unresolved.
§ <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to one’s liability to pay <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> caused by <b>pebbles</b> inadvertently propelled by the foot of a walking animal, does the owner of the animal <b>pay</b> restitution exclusively <b>from</b> the <b>body</b> of the animal, just as one pays half the cost of the damage caused by an innocuous ox with regard to damage categorized under the primary category of Goring? <b>Or</b> does he <b>pay</b> restitution <b>from</b> his <b>superior</b>-<b>quality</b> land, as he does for other forms of damage? The Gemara elaborates: Does he <b>pay</b> restitution exclusively <b>from</b> the <b>body</b> of the animal, <b>as we do not find</b> any case where one <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage from</b> his <b>superior</b>-<b>quality</b> land? <b>Or perhaps he pays</b> restitution <b>from</b> his <b>superior</b>-<b>quality</b> land, <b>as we do not find</b> any case where an animal causes damage <b>in its</b> typical <b>manner where</b> the owner <b>pays</b> restitution exclusively <b>from</b> the <b>body</b> of his animal?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>hopping,</b> a chicken <b>is not</b> deemed <b>forewarned. And some say</b> that <b>it is forewarned.</b> The Gemara questions the formulation of the <i>baraita</i>: Does it <b>enter your mind</b> to raise the possibility that a chicken is not forewarned with regard to <b>hopping?</b> Hopping is the typical manner of movement for chickens. <b>Rather, is it not</b> that the reference in the <i>baraita</i> is to a case where the chicken was <b>hopping and propelled</b> pebbles that caused the damage?
<b>And</b> it is <b>with regard to this</b> matter <b>that they disagree: The one who says</b> that the chicken <b>is not</b> deemed <b>forewarned holds that</b> its owner <b>pays</b> restitution <b>from</b> the <b>body</b> of the animal, as is the <i>halakha</i> when an innocuous animal gores, while <b>the one who says</b> that the chicken <b>is forewarned holds that he pays</b> restitution <b>from</b> his <b>superior</b>-<b>quality</b> land, as is the <i>halakha</i> when a forewarned animal causes damage. According to this analysis, Rava’s dilemma is the subject of a tannaitic dispute.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> perhaps the dispute in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute of Sumakhos and the Rabbis</b> with regard to the legal status of damage caused by a force generated by the animal’s action. It is with regard to the similarity of damage caused by an action performed by an animal’s body to the case where the chicken was hopping and propelled pebbles that caused the damage that the <i>tanna’im</i> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>disagree.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of this dilemma from a mishna (21b): If <b>the dog took a loaf [<i>ḥarara</i>]</b> that was baking on hot coals <b>and went to a stack of grain</b> to eat the loaf, <b>and</b> the dog <b>ate the loaf and ignited the stack</b> of grain with one of the coals attached to the loaf, the owner of the dog <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage for</b> the damage to <b>the loaf,</b> as it is classified in the primary category of Eating, <b>and he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage for</b> the damage to <b>the stack</b> of grain. Rabbi Elazar says: He pays the full cost of the damage for the damage to the stack of grain as well.
<b>What is the reason</b> that the first <i>tanna</i> holds that the owner pays half the cost of the damage caused to the stack of grain? <b>Is it not due to</b> the fact <b>that it is</b> analogous to propelling <b>pebbles,</b> as the coal fell from the loaf held in its mouth and ignited the grain? <b>And</b> it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in that regard</b> that when the first <i>tanna</i> said that <b>he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> he pays restitution exclusively <b>from</b> proceeds of the sale of the <b>body</b> of his animal. Apparently, half the cost of the damage caused by pebbles is paid from the body of the animal that caused the damage.
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>And can you understand</b> the <i>baraita</i> in that way? According to that understanding, with regard to Rabbi Elazar, who disagrees with the first <i>tanna</i> and holds that the owner of the dog pays the full cost of the damage caused to the grain, <b>do we find</b> anywhere that <b>according to Rabbi Elazar</b> one <b>pays</b> restitution exclusively <b>from</b> proceeds of the sale of the <b>body</b> of his animal?
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> can be explained in a case <b>where</b> the dog <b>acted atypically with this coal</b> with which he lit the stack of grain. Since the dog’s behavior was atypical, the damage is classified under the primary category of Goring, not under the category of Eating. <b>And Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon, who says</b> in a mishna (24b): The <i>halakha</i> of <b>Goring in the courtyard of the injured</b> party <b>is atypical,</b> as there, the owner of the ox <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage,</b> in contrast to half the cost of the damage that he pays when it transpires in the public domain. Nevertheless, since it was an innocuous animal that caused the damage, restitution is paid from its body.
The Gemara rejects that explanation: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so. What is the reason</b> that <b>you interpreted</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the difficulty presented by the <i>halakha</i> that he pays <b>the full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> exclusively from proceeds of the sale of the body of the animal, which would not be so according to Rabbi Elazar.
The Gemara suggests: There is an alternative explanation. <b>Rabbi Elazar holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos, who says</b> that one <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> caused by <b>pebbles, and</b> he also <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> with regard to a forewarned ox: <b>The aspect of innocuousness,</b> which dictates that the owner pays half the cost of the damage from the body of the ox, <b>remains intact.</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda, the owner of a forewarned ox pays half the cost of the damage from the body of his ox and half the cost of the damage from his superior<b>-</b>quality land. <b>And</b> when the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that the owner pays restitution <b>from the body</b> of his animal, the reference is <b>to the aspect of innocuousness,</b> i.e., half the cost of the damage. He pays the other half from his superior<b>-</b>quality land as he would in the case of any forewarned animal.
<b>Rav Samma, son of Rav Ashi, said to Ravina: Say that you heard</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> stated that the aspect of innocuousness remains intact <b>with regard to</b> damage categorized under the primary category of Goring, where the ox was initially <b>innocuous and</b> then <b>became forewarned. In</b> the case of propelled pebbles, which is a subcategory of Trampling, where the ox is <b>forewarned from the outset,</b>

Daf 18b

<b>did you hear him</b> distinguish between the different parts of the payment? There is no aspect of innocuousness in the case of pebbles.
<b>Rather, when Rabbi Elazar says</b> that the owner of the dog pays the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> in a case that is similar to one of propelled pebbles, he was referring to a case <b>where</b> the owner of the animal <b>was forewarned</b> with regard to this matter. <b>And they disagree about this</b> point: One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>holds</b> that <b>there is forewarning with regard to</b> propelling <b>pebbles;</b> therefore, if there was testimony given in court that a particular animal regularly propels pebbles in the course of its walking, the animal is deemed forewarned and its owner pays the full cost of the damage. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>there is no forewarning with regard to pebbles.</b> Apparently, payment for damage caused by pebbles is paid from the body of the animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if this is the case, then <b>the dilemma raised by Rava</b> concerning whether there <b>is forewarning for</b> propelling <b>pebbles or there is no forewarning for</b> propelling <b>pebbles,</b> can be resolved from this dispute. <b>If</b> the dilemma is raised <b>according to the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>there is no forewarning for</b> propelling <b>pebbles. If</b> the dilemma is raised <b>according to Rabbi Elazar, there is forewarning for</b> propelling <b>pebbles.</b>
The Gemara answers that <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: When I raise the dilemma,</b> I do so specifically <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis who disagree with Sumakhos</b> and hold that one pays half the cost of the damage in the case of pebbles; <b>but here</b> in this <i>baraita</i>, <b>both the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>and Rabbi Elazar hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos, who says that</b> in the case of <b>pebbles, one pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
And <b>what is the reason</b> that <b>the Rabbis say</b> that one pays <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> in the case of pebbles? It is <b>that</b> in the case of pebbles the animal <b>acted atypically and was not forewarned. And</b> in this <i>baraita</i>, concerning the dog that lit the stack of grain, the dispute between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Elazar is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Tarfon and the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the <i>halakha</i> in the case of damage caused by an innocuous ox on the property of the injured party.
The Gemara rejects the parallel between the opinion of Rabbi Elazar and the opinion of Rabbi Tarfon. <b>Say that you heard</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Tarfon</b> the owner pays the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage;</b> but <b>did you hear</b> that <b>according to</b> Rabbi Tarfon restitution is paid only <b>from the body</b> of the animal that caused the damage?
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> Rabbi Tarfon holds that restitution is paid only from the body of the animal that caused the damage. <b>From where does</b> Rabbi Tarfon <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that when damage is caused by an innocuous ox on the property of the injured party its owner is liable to pay the full cost of the damage and not merely half? He derives it via an <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>from</b> damage categorized as <b>Goring</b> that is caused <b>in the public domain,</b> as explained in the mishna (24b).
His ruling is based on the principle: <b>It is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source,</b> i.e., a <i>halakha</i> derived from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference cannot be more stringent than the source of that derivation. Since restitution for damage categorized as Goring that is caused in the public domain is paid only from the body of the damaging animal, the same is true with regard to restitution for damage categorized as Goring that is caused on the property of the injured party.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> it clear from that mishna that <b>Rabbi Tarfon does not accept</b> the principle: <b>It is sufficient</b> for the conclusion that emerges from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference to be like its source, as, if he accepted that principle, not only would he hold that payment is only from the body of the animal, he would also require payment of half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara answers: He does not reject the principle. <b>When he does not accept</b> the principle: <b>It is sufficient</b> for the conclusion that emerges from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference to be like its source, it is in a case <b>where</b> the result of rejecting the principle is <b>that</b> the <b><i>a fortiori</i> inference is refuted.</b> But in a case <b>where</b> the result of rejecting the principle is <b>that</b> the <b><i>a fortiori</i> inference is not refuted,</b> but will be applied in a more limited fashion, <b>he accepts</b> the principle: <b>It is sufficient</b> for the conclusion that emerges from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference to be like its source. Therefore, in this case the payment of the full cost of the damage, which is derived by means of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference, is paid only from the body of the animal based on the principle: It is sufficient for the conclusion that emerges from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference to be like its source.
§ The Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself,</b> cited earlier. <b>Rava raises</b> a <b>dilemma: Is there forewarning for</b> propelling <b>pebbles,</b> so that the owner would pay the full cost of the damage if he had been fore-warned three times, <b>or is there no forewarning for</b> propelling <b>pebbles,</b> and he will always pay half the cost of the damage? The Gemara elaborates: <b>Do we liken</b> the case of propelled pebbles <b>to</b> damage categorized as <b>Goring?</b> Accordingly, when an innocuous ox causes damage by propelling pebbles its owner pays half the cost of the damage, and when a forewarned ox does so the owner pays the full cost of the damage. <b>Or perhaps, is it a subcategory</b> of the primary category <b>of Trampling,</b> which is deemed forewarned from the outset? Accordingly, the owner would always pay half the cost of the damage, as there is no change in status after the third warning.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the resolution of this dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>hopping,</b> a chicken <b>is not</b> deemed <b>forewarned. And some say that it is forewarned.</b> The Gemara questions the formulation of the <i>baraita</i>: Does it <b>enter your mind</b> to raise the possibility that a chicken is not forewarned with regard to <b>hopping?</b> Hopping is the typical manner of movement for chickens. <b>Rather, is it not</b> that the reference in the <i>baraita</i> is to a case where the chicken was <b>hopping and propelled</b> pebbles that caused damage?
<b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the chicken has <b>done</b> so <b>three times? And</b> it is <b>with regard to this</b> that <b>they disagree:</b> One <b>Sage holds: There is forewarning for</b> pebbles, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage holds: There is no forewarning for</b> pebbles. According to this analysis, Rava’s dilemma is the subject of a tannaitic dispute. The Gemara rejects this resolution: <b>No,</b> perhaps the reference in the <i>baraita</i> is to a case where the chicken hopped only <b>one time. And</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Sumakhos and the Rabbis,</b> concerning the compensation for damage caused by pebbles.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the resolution to the dilemma from an amoraic dispute: If <b>an animal dropped excrement onto dough</b> and damaged it, <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> The owner of the animal <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage, and Rabbi Elazar says:</b> He pays <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage. What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the animal has <b>done</b> so <b>three times? And</b> it is <b>with regard to this</b> that <b>they disagree,</b> as one <b>Sage holds: There is forewarning for</b> pebbles, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage holds: There is no forewarning for</b> pebbles.
The Gemara rejects this resolution: <b>No,</b> perhaps the reference in the <i>baraita</i> is to a case where the animal dropped excrement only <b>one time. And</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Sumakhos and the Rabbis,</b> concerning compensation for damage caused by pebbles. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> this <b>atypical</b> behavior of the animal, and since all behavior that deviates from the norm is classified within the category of Goring, the owner should be liable to pay only half the cost of the damage? The Gemara answers: The case is one <b>where</b> the animal <b>was forced</b> into a narrow place and had no alternative to relieving itself onto the dough; therefore, it does not constitute atypical behavior.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the amoraic dispute parallels the tannaitic dispute, <b>let Rav Yehuda say:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos, and let Rabbi Elazar say:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> instead of stating their dispute in the context of the particular case of the animal and the dough. The Gemara answers: It was <b>necessary</b> for them to state their dispute in this case, as there is a novel element concerning <b>excrement. It</b> would <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> the excrement <b>is drawn after</b> the body of the animal, its legal status is <b>like</b> that of damage caused by <b>its body,</b> not like pebbles propelled by the animal. Therefore, their stating the dispute with regard to excrement <b>teaches us</b> that its status is like that of propelling pebbles. Therefore, the dispute between Rav Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar can be explained as parallel to the dispute between Sumakhos and the Rabbis with regard to pebbles.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> resolution to the dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel taught:</b> In the case of <b>a rooster that extended its head into the airspace of a glass vessel and crowed in</b> the vessel <b>and broke it</b> with the sound waves, its owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage. And Rav Yosef said</b> that the Sages from <b>the school of Rav say:</b> If <b>a horse neighed or a donkey brayed and</b> the sound waves <b>broke vessels,</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b> These are cases similar to the case of pebbles, and there is a dispute between the Sages with regard to these cases.
<b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the rooster or animal has <b>done</b> so <b>three times?</b>

Daf 19a

<b>And</b> it is <b>with regard to this</b> that <b>they disagree:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i> in the <i>baraita</i> cited by Rami bar Yeḥezkel, <b>holds: There is forewarning</b> for pebbles, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Yosef, <b>holds: There is no forewarning</b> for pebbles.
The Gemara rejects this resolution: <b>No,</b> perhaps the reference in the <i>baraita</i> is to a case where the rooster or animal damaged the vessel <b>one time. And</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>Sumakhos and the Rabbis,</b> concerning compensation for damage caused by pebbles. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t</b> it <b>atypical</b> behavior for an animal to insert its head into a glass vessel, and isn’t all atypical behavior classified within the category of Goring, meaning that the owner should be liable to pay only half the cost of the damage? The Gemara answers: The case is one where <b>there were seeds in</b> the vessel, and therefore the rooster extending its head into the vessel is considered typical behavior.
<b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma: Is there</b> any halakhic significance to <b>deviation</b> from typical behavior <b>with regard to</b> propelling <b>pebbles,</b> and therefore if an animal propelled pebbles in an atypical manner its owner is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>one-quarter of the damage,</b> i.e., half the restitution for damage caused by pebbles? <b>Or, is there no</b> halakhic significance to <b>deviation</b> from typical behavior <b>with regard to</b> propelling <b>pebbles,</b> resulting in its owner being liable <b>to</b> pay only <b>one-quarter of the damage,</b> and therefore, even in an atypical case, the owner pays the standard restitution of half the cost of the damage?
The Gemara answers: <b>Resolve</b> Rav Ashi’s dilemma <b>from Rava’s</b> dilemma, <b>as Rava raises a dilemma: Is there forewarning for pebbles, or is there no forewarning for pebbles?</b> Based on that dilemma, one may conclude <b>by inference that there is no</b> halakhic significance to <b>deviation</b> from typical behavior with regard to pebbles propelled by an animal, resulting in its owner being liable to pay only one-quarter of the damage, as, were that the case, forewarning would lead to an animal owner’s liability to pay half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Perhaps Rava stated</b> his dilemma employing the style of: <b>If you say. If you say</b> that <b>there is no</b> halakhic significance to <b>deviation</b> from typical behavior with regard to propelling pebbles, resulting in its owner being liable to pay only one-quarter of the damage, and the owner pays half the cost of the damage in every case, <b>is there forewarning for</b> pebbles, meaning that after three incidents the owner pays the full cost of the damage, <b>or is there no forewarning for</b> pebbles? According to that understanding, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to Rav Ashi’s dilemma cannot be inferred from Rava’s dilemma. Rav Ashi’s dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Ashi raises</b> another <b>dilemma</b> with regard to pebbles: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos,</b> that one pays the full cost of the damage in the case of propelled pebbles, what is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to damage caused <b>by a force</b> generated by <b>a force</b> generated by the animal’s action? Is the status of that secondary force <b>like</b> that of damage caused by <b>a force</b> generated by <b>its</b> action, in which case the owner is liable, <b>or</b> is its status <b>not like</b> that of damage caused by <b>a force</b> generated by <b>its</b> action?
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Did</b> Sumakhos <b>learn</b> the <i>halakha</i> that one pays half the cost of the damage caused by pebbles as <b>a tradition</b> transmitted to Moses at Sinai, <b>and he interprets</b> that tradition as applying in a case where the damage was caused <b>by a force</b> generated by <b>a force</b> generated by the action of an animal? By contrast, in a typical case of damage caused by pebbles, which is an example of a force generated by the action of an animal, the owner pays the full cost of the damage, as it is a subcategory of Trampling. <b>Or perhaps he did not learn</b> any <i>halakha</i> as <b>a tradition</b> in this regard <b>at all,</b> and therefore even in a case where the damage was caused by a force generated by a force generated by the action of an animal, the owner pays the full cost of the damage, as it is a subcategory of Trampling. The Gemara concludes: This dilemma, too, <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches: If the animal <b>was kicking</b> while it was walking, <b>or</b> it occurred <b>that pebbles were</b> inadvertently <b>propelled from under its feet and</b> those pebbles <b>broke vessels,</b> the owner of the animal <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>what</b> case <b>is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>speaking?</b>
The Gemara elaborates: Is the <i>tanna</i> saying that if the animal <b>was kicking and caused damage</b> directly <b>with its kick,</b> which is a subcategory of Goring, <b>or</b> if the animal was walking and propelled <b>pebbles in its typical manner,</b> the owner of the animal <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage, and,</b> accordingly, the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that one pays half the cost of damage caused by pebbles? <b>Or perhaps</b> the <i>tanna</i> is saying: If the animal <b>was kicking and caused damage</b> directly <b>with its kick, or</b> if the animal propelled <b>pebbles due to its kick</b> and the pebbles caused damage, the owner of the animal <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b> Accordingly, one may infer: <b>But</b> if the animal propelled <b>pebbles</b> as it was walking <b>in its typical manner,</b> the owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage, and</b> if so, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Sumakhos.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma <b>from the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If an animal <b>trod upon a vessel and broke it and</b> then a shard of that vessel <b>fell upon</b> a second <b>vessel and broke it,</b> the owner <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage for the first</b> vessel, <b>and he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage for the latter</b> vessel. <b>And if</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Sumakhos, does he hold</b> that one pays <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> caused by pebbles?
<b>And if you would say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Sumakhos, and can be understood as follows: <b>The first</b> vessel, concerning which the owner of the animal pays the full cost of the damage, is <b>the first</b> vessel damaged following the <b>propelling</b> of shards from the vessel upon which the animal trod, i.e., the second vessel that was broken. <b>And the second</b> vessel, concerning which the owner of the animal pays half the cost of the damage, is <b>the second</b> vessel following the <b>propelling</b> of shards from the vessel upon which the animal trod, i.e., the third vessel that was broken by shards from the second vessel. <b>And</b> the reason for the difference in liability is that <b>there is a difference, according to Sumakhos, between</b> damage caused <b>by a force</b> generated by the action of an animal, for which the owner pays the full cost of the damage, and damage caused by <b>a force</b> generated by <b>a force</b> generated by <b>its</b> action, for which he pays for only half the cost of the damage.
<b>But</b> if one were to say this explanation, what can be said of <b>that dilemma which Rav Ashi raised: According to</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos,</b> that one pays the full cost of the damage in the case of propelled pebbles, what is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to damage caused <b>by a force</b> generated by <b>a force</b> generated by the animal’s action? Is the status of that secondary force <b>like</b> that of damage caused by <b>a force</b> generated by <b>its</b> action, in which case the owner is liable, <b>or</b> is its status <b>not like</b> that of damage caused by <b>a force</b> generated by <b>its</b> action? Why does he have a dilemma? Let him <b>resolve</b> from here <b>that</b> its status is <b>not like</b> that of damage caused by <b>a force</b> generated by <b>its</b> action.
The Gemara answers: Perhaps <b>Rav Ashi interprets</b> the mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that one pays half the cost of the damage in the case of propelled pebbles, <b>and</b> he <b>raises this dilemma:</b> If the animal <b>was kicking and caused damage</b> directly <b>with its kick,</b> which is a subcategory of Goring, <b>or</b> if the animal was walking and propelled <b>pebbles in its typical manner,</b> the owner of the animal pays <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b> Accordingly, one may infer: <b>But</b> if the pebbles were propelled <b>due to a kick,</b> the owner pays <b>one-quarter of the damage. And there is</b> halakhic significance to <b>deviation</b> from typical behavior with regard to a case of pebbles, resulting in its owner being liable to pay only one-quarter of the damage.
<b>Or perhaps</b> the <i>tanna</i> is saying: If the animal <b>was kicking and caused damage</b> directly <b>with its kick or</b> if the animal propelled <b>pebbles due to its kick</b> and the pebbles caused damage, the owner of the animal <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage. And there is no</b> halakhic significance to <b>deviation</b> from typical behavior with regard to a case of pebbles. The Gemara concludes: Rav Ashi’s dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel raised a dilemma before Rabbi Ami, and some say</b> that it was <b>before Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba:</b> If the animal <b>was walking in a place where it is impossible for it</b> to walk <b>without propelling</b> pebbles as it proceeds, <b>and it kicked and propelled</b> pebbles <b>and caused damage, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara elaborates: Does one say that <b>since it is impossible for it</b> to walk without propelling pebbles, propelling pebbles <b>is its typical manner</b> in that situation and the <i>halakha</i> in this case would be the same as any case of pebbles? <b>Or perhaps,</b> since <b>now, in any event, the pebbles were propelled due to a kick,</b> it is different. The Gemara concludes: Rabbi Abba bar Memel’s dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma before Rabbi Zeira:</b> If the animal <b>was walking in the public domain and</b> it <b>kicked and propelled</b> pebbles <b>and caused damage, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara elaborates: <b>Do we liken</b> the damage in this instance <b>to Goring,</b> since the action was performed with intent, <b>and</b> therefore the owner of the animal <b>is liable</b> even though the incident transpired in the public domain? <b>Or perhaps,</b> since this is a case of pebbles, <b>it</b> is classified as <b>a subcategory of Trampling and</b> the owner is <b>exempt</b> from liability in the public domain. Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: It stands to reason</b> that <b>it is a subcategory of Trampling.</b>
Rabbi Yirmeya continued and asked Rabbi Zeira another question: If an animal <b>propelled</b> pebbles <b>in the public domain and caused damage on private property, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him,</b> employing terminology from the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat: If <b>there is no</b> act of <b>lifting here, is there</b> an act of <b>placing here?</b> Since the animal propelled the pebbles in the public domain, the owner is exempt from liability for any damage that it causes. The fact that the damage occurred on private property is not relevant.
Rabbi Yirmeya <b>raised an objection to</b> Rabbi Zeira’s first statement, that one is exempt from liability for one’s animal propelling pebbles in the public domain because it is classified as a subcategory of Trampling, from a <i>baraita</i>: If an animal <b>was walking along the way and it propelled</b> pebbles, <b>whether</b> it was <b>on private property</b> and <b>whether</b> it was <b>in the public domain,</b> the owner is <b>liable</b> to pay damages. <b>What, is it not</b> a case where the pebbles were <b>propelled in the public domain and caused damage in the public domain?</b> Rabbi Zeira replied: <b>No,</b> the reference is to a case where the animal <b>propelled</b> the pebbles <b>in the public domain and caused damage on private property.</b> Rabbi Yirmeya asked him: <b>But didn’t you say:</b> If <b>there is no</b> act of <b>lifting here, is there</b> an act of <b>placing here?</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: I retract</b> my previous statement, as there is proof from the <i>baraita</i> that there is liability in that case.
Rabbi Yirmeya <b>raised an objection to</b> Rabbi Zeira’s first statement from the mishna: If an animal <b>trod upon a vessel and broke it and</b> then a shard of that vessel <b>fell upon</b> a second <b>vessel and broke it,</b> the owner <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage for the first</b> vessel, as its action is classified under the primary category of Trampling, <b>and he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage for the latter</b> vessel. <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to this</b> <i>halakha</i>: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case where the incident transpired <b>on the</b> private <b>property of the injured</b> party; <b>but</b> if it transpired <b>in the public domain,</b> the owner of the animal is <b>exempt</b> from liability <b>for the first</b> vessel, as it is classified as a subcategory of Trampling, <b>and</b> he is <b>liable for</b> the damage to <b>the second</b> vessel. <b>What, is it not</b> that the animal <b>propelled</b> the pebbles <b>in the public domain and it caused damage in the public domain,</b> indicating that one does not pay for damage caused by pebbles in the public domain?
Rabbi Zeira replied: <b>No,</b> perhaps the reference in the mishna is to a case where the animal <b>propelled</b> the pebbles <b>in the public domain and it caused damage on private property.</b> Rabbi Yirmeya said: <b>But didn’t you say:</b> If <b>there is no</b> act of <b>lifting here, is there</b> an act of <b>placing here?</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: I retract</b> my previous statement.
Rabbi Yirmeya raises an additional objection to Rabbi Zeira’s statement: <b>Is that so?</b> Is the owner of the animal exempt from liability for pebbles propelled by his animal in the public domain?

Daf 19b

<b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say:</b> Payment of <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage is not differentiated</b> between private and public domains, as there is no exemption from payment <b>neither</b> for damage <b>on private property nor</b> for damage <b>in the public domain? What, is</b> this principle <b>not</b> stated even in a case where the animal <b>propelled</b> pebbles <b>in the public domain and caused damage in the public domain?</b> Rabbi Zeira said to him: <b>No,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan stated this principle in a case where the animal <b>propelled</b> pebbles <b>in the public domain and caused damage on private property.</b>
Rabbi Yirmeya said to him: <b>But didn’t you say:</b> If <b>there is no</b> act of <b>lifting here, is there</b> an act of <b>placing here?</b> Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: I retract</b> my previous statement. Or, <b>if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>When Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that payment of half the cost of the damage is not differentiated between private and public domains, and there is no exemption from payment neither for damage on private property nor for damage in the public domain, he said it only <b>with regard to</b> damage in the category of <b>Goring,</b> but not with regard to the case of propelled pebbles, for which one is exempt in the public domain.
§ The Gemara relates that <b>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia and Rabbi Oshaya sat in the antechamber [<i>akil’a</i>] of Rabbi Yehuda</b> Nesia. <b>A matter emerged from among them</b> and one of them raised a dilemma: If an animal <b>swung its tail</b> and thereby caused damage, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>The other</b> Sage <b>said to him: Must</b> the owner <b>grasp its tail and walk</b> to prevent the animal from causing damage? Since this is typical behavior for the animal, the owner should be exempt from liability. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, with regard to</b> damage in the category of <b>Goring, too, let us say: Must</b> the owner <b>grasp its horn and walk</b> to prevent the animal from causing damage? Nevertheless, the <i>halakha</i> is that the owner is liable for damage in the category of Goring.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared?</b> Damage in the category of <b>Goring is not</b> caused in the course of the <b>typical</b> behavior <b>of</b> the animal. Consequently, the owner is required to prevent his animal from causing damage in that manner. <b>This</b> damage caused by the swinging of an animal’s tail is caused in the course of <b>its typical</b> behavior, and one cannot hold the owner responsible for an animal's normal behavior.
The Gemara asks: <b>And since that is its typical behavior, what is the dilemma</b> that <b>he raised?</b> Obviously one has no liability for the damage caused by the typical behavior of his animal in the public domain. The Gemara answers: <b>He raised a dilemma</b> with regard to a case of <b>excessive</b> tail <b>swinging;</b> is excessive tail swinging considered typical behavior?
<b>Rav Eina raises a dilemma:</b> If an animal <b>swung its penis</b> and caused damage, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara elaborates: <b>Do we say just as it is with regard to Goring: Is it not</b> so in a case of <b>Goring</b> that the animal’s <b>inclination overcame it</b> and caused it to gore? <b>Here too, it is no different:</b> The animal’s inclination overcame it and that is why it caused damage. <b>Or perhaps</b> the cases are different, as in the case of damage in the category of <b>Goring</b> the <b>objective</b> of <b>its</b> action <b>is to cause damage,</b> whereas in <b>this</b> case the <b>objective</b> of <b>its</b> action <b>is not to cause damage.</b> The Gemara concludes: This dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Chickens are</b> deemed <b>forewarned</b> with regard <b>to walking in their</b> typical <b>manner and breaking</b> objects. If there was a string tied to a chicken’s leg and it broke a vessel, or if the chicken was hopping in an atypical manner and breaking vessels, its owner pays half the cost of the damage. <b>Rav Huna says: They taught</b> that one pays half the cost of the damage <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the string <b>was tied</b> to the leg of the chicken <b>on its own,</b> i.e., a string became entangled on the leg of a chicken without the involvement of the owner and an item was broken by the string; <b>but if a person tied</b> the string to the chicken, he is <b>liable</b> to pay the full cost of the damage, as the string is in the category of Pit.
The Gemara asks: If the string <b>was tied on its own, who is liable</b> to pay half the cost of the damage? <b>If we say</b> it is the <b>owner of the string</b> who pays, as the damage was caused by the string, <b>what are the circumstances? If</b> it is a case where the owner of the string <b>concealed</b> the string in a secure place and the chicken became entangled in it, the owner of the string <b>is a victim of circumstances beyond his control</b> and would be exempt from payment. <b>And if he did not conceal it</b> and instead left it exposed where it could become entangled in the feet of a passing chicken, <b>he is negligent</b> and liable as though he actually tied the string to the chicken.
<b>Rather,</b> the case in the mishna is one where the owner of the string concealed it and is exempt from liability, and Rav Huna means that the <b>owner of the chicken</b> is <b>liable.</b> Here too, the question arises: <b>What is different</b> in this case where one is <b>not</b> obligated to pay <b>the full</b> cost of <b>the damage, as it is written</b> (Exodus 21:33): <b>“If a man shall open a pit,</b> or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or a donkey fall therein,” he pays the damage, <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> written: If <b>an ox</b> shall open <b>a pit.</b> This indicates that if an ox opens a pit, the owner of the ox is exempt from liability. With regard to the payment of <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage as well,</b> the owner should be exempt from liability, as it is written: “If <b>a man</b> shall open <b>a pit,” and</b> it is <b>not</b> written: If <b>an ox</b> shall open <b>a pit.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the case in <b>the mishna</b> is one where the chicken <b>moved</b> the string and thereby caused damage. Since the chicken did not cause damage with its body, the owner pays half the cost of the damage, as he does in a case of pebbles. <b>And when Rav Huna’s</b> distinction between whether the string was tied on its own or by a person <b>was stated, it was stated in a general</b> sense, and not with regard to the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna. With regard to <b>an ownerless string</b> tied to the leg of a chicken, <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If the string <b>was tied</b> to the leg of the chicken <b>on its own,</b> the owner of the chicken is <b>exempt; but if a person tied</b> the string to the chicken, he is <b>liable</b> to pay the full cost of the damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>Due to what</b> primary category of damage is he <b>liable? Rav Huna bar Manoaḥ says:</b> He is liable <b>due to</b> the fact that although the string is not stationary, as in the standard obstacle in the primary category of Pit, this is an example of <b>his pit that is rolled at the feet of a person and at the hooves of an animal,</b> and that too is a subcategory of Pit.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> Within the context of the primary category of Eating, for <b>what</b> damage caused with <b>the tooth</b> is an animal deemed <b>forewarned?</b> It is deemed forewarned with regard <b>to eating</b> food items <b>fit for its</b> consumption. <b>The domesticated animal is</b> deemed <b>forewarned</b> with regard <b>to eating fruits and vegetables.</b> If the animal <b>ate garments or vessels,</b> the owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b> As these are not items fit for its consumption, the animal is not deemed forewarned in this case. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> applied, that one pays the full value of the food eaten by the animal? It is a case where the animal ate the food <b>on the property of the injured</b> party; <b>but</b> if the animal ate food <b>in the public domain,</b> the owner of the animal is <b>exempt</b> from liability.
<b>And</b> even if the animal ate food in the public domain, <b>if</b> the animal <b>derives benefit</b> from eating another’s produce in the public domain, the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that it derives,</b> just not for the full cost of the food.
<b>Under what</b> circumstances does the owner of the animal <b>pay</b> for <b>the benefit that it derives?</b> If the animal <b>ate</b> produce <b>in</b> the public <b>square</b> in the area before the storefronts, the owner of the animal <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that it derives.</b> If the animal ate <b>from</b> food placed at <b>the side of</b> the public <b>square,</b> which is not a public thoroughfare, the owner of the animal <b>pays</b> for <b>what it damaged,</b> as the legal status of that area is like that of the property of the injured party. If the animal ate produce <b>from the entrance of the store,</b> its owner <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that it derives,</b> as the status of a store entrance is like that of the public domain. If the animal ate produce <b>from inside the store,</b> its owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what it damaged.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: Eating is</b> deemed <b>forewarned</b> in that an animal tends <b>to eat that which is fit for it</b> to eat. <b>How</b> is this applied? In the case of <b>a domesticated animal that entered the courtyard of the injured</b> party <b>and it ate food fit for it</b> to eat, <b>or if it drank drinks fit for it</b> to drink, the owner of the animal must <b>pay the full</b> cost of the <b>damage. And similarly,</b> in the case of <b>an undomesticated animal that entered the courtyard of the injured</b> party <b>and tore apart a domesticated animal and ate</b> its <b>meat</b> there, the owner must <b>pay the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
And in the case of <b>a cow that ate barley,</b> although this is not normally a food that a cow would eat, or in the case of <b>a donkey that ate vetches,</b> i.e., legumes which are usually fed to cows but not to donkeys, <b>or</b> in the case of <b>a dog that licked oil or a pig ate meat,</b> the owner of the animal must <b>pay the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b> Although these animals do not ordinarily consume these items, doing so is not a significant deviation from the animal’s typical behavior. <b>Rav Pappa said: Now that you said</b> that eating <b>anything that</b> is <b>not typical for</b> an animal to eat <b>but it eats it under duress</b> is <b>considered</b> an ordinary act of <b>eating,</b> it can be deduced that in the case of <b>a cat that eats dates or a donkey that is eating fish,</b> the owner must <b>pay the full</b> cost of the <b>damage,</b> despite the fact that these animals do not ordinarily eat these items.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain donkey that ate bread and</b> while eating it also <b>broke the basket</b> in which the bread was stored. <b>Rav Yehuda obligated</b> the owner <b>to pay the full</b> cost of the <b>damage for</b> the loss of <b>the bread and half</b> the cost of <b>the damage to the basket.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But why? Since it is typical for</b> a donkey <b>to eat bread, it is also typical</b> for it <b>to break the basket</b> in which the bread is stored; therefore, the owner should pay the full cost of the damage for the basket as well. The Gemara answers: This case is one where the donkey <b>ate</b> the bread <b>and then</b> afterward <b>broke</b> the basket, a sequence which demonstrates that its intent was to cause damage. The breaking of the basket is therefore a subcategory of Goring, and the owner is liable to pay only half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>But is it typical for</b> a donkey to eat <b>bread?</b> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> against this based on a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>it ate bread or meat or a cooked dish,</b> its owner <b>must pay for half</b> the cost of <b>the damage. What, is it not referring to a domesticated animal</b> and thereby implying that it is not typical for a domesticated animal to eat bread? The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it is discussing <b>an undomesticated animal,</b> which does not typically eat bread, but a domesticated animal does eat bread.
The Gemara questions this explanation: If the <i>baraita</i> is discussing <b>an undomesticated animal,</b> then it is <b>typical for it</b> to eat <b>meat.</b> The Gemara clarifies: The <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>meat that is roasted,</b> and it is not typical for an undomesticated animal to eat roasted meat. <b>Or, if you wish, say</b> instead that the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> is not stated with regard to an undomesticated predator, but <b>with regard to a deer,</b> which does not ordinarily eat meat and bread. <b>Or, if you wish, say</b> that <b>actually</b> it is discussing <b>a domesticated animal,</b> but it is discussing a case where the animal ate <b>at the table,</b> and this is not typical behavior for an animal.

Daf 20a

The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain goat that saw a turnip on top of a clay barrel [<i>dedanna</i>]. It climbed</b> and <b>went up</b> and <b>ate the turnip, and</b> in doing so it <b>broke the barrel. Rava obligated</b> the owner of the goat to pay <b>the full</b> cost of the <b>damage,</b> both <b>for the turnip and for the barrel.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that he held the owner fully liable for the clay barrel as well as for the turnip? After all, breaking barrels is not the typical behavior of a goat. The Gemara answers: <b>Since it is typical</b> for the goat <b>to eat</b> the <b>turnip, it is also typical</b> for it <b>to climb and go up</b> in order to get it. Consequently, breaking the vessel is categorized as Eating.
§ <b>Ilfa says:</b> If <b>a domesticated animal</b> was <b>in the public domain, and it stretched out its neck and ate from</b> a sack of produce that was loaded on <b>the back of another</b> animal, its owner is <b>liable</b> to pay the full cost of the damage. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara explains: <b>The back of the other</b> animal is <b>considered like the courtyard of the injured</b> party, and for this reason the owner of the animal is liable for damage classified as Eating there.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports his</b> opinion (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:7): If a person was standing in the public domain, and <b>his basket</b> containing food <b>was slung behind his back, and</b> an animal <b>stretched out its neck and ate from it,</b> its owner is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara rejects this: This <i>baraita</i> does not support Ilfa’s opinion, because one could explain that the case in that <i>baraita</i> is <b>as Rava says</b> in a different situation: The ruling is stated <b>with regard to a jumping</b> animal; <b>here also</b> it can be suggested that the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to a jumping</b> animal, and since the animal engaged in atypical behavior it is classified as a case of Goring as opposed to a case of Eating. For damage classified as Goring, the owner of the animal is liable for his animal’s actions in the public domain, although he pays only half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>And where,</b> i.e., in what context, <b>was Rava’s</b> interpretation initially <b>stated?</b> The Gemara answers: It was stated <b>with regard to that which Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> If <b>a domesticated animal</b> was <b>walking along and eating in the public domain</b> its owner is <b>exempt,</b> but if it was <b>standing and eating</b> he is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara questions this ruling: <b>What is different</b> if it <b>was walking?</b> Is it <b>because</b> eating while walking <b>is</b> the <b>typical</b> behavior of an animal? But <b>standing</b> and eating <b>is also typical</b> behavior. <b>Rava says:</b> Rabbi Oshaya’s ruling is stated <b>with regard to a jumping</b> animal, which is not typical behavior for the animal.
§ <b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma:</b> If an animal was <b>rolling, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case about which Rabbi Zeira inquires? The Gemara answers: <b>For example,</b> if there was <b>a sheaf</b> of grain <b>on private property, and it was rolled along</b> by the animal <b>and</b> the sheaf <b>went from the private property into the public domain,</b> and the animal ate it there, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Should this be treated as a case of Eating on private property, rendering the owner of the animal liable, or should it be treated as a case of Eating in the public domain, thereby exempting him from liability?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from a <i>baraita</i>, <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught:</b> If <b>a load</b> of food was located <b>partly inside</b> the property of its owner <b>and partly outside</b> of his property, i.e., in the public domain, and an animal <b>ate inside</b> the private property, its owner is <b>liable,</b> as this is a case of damage classified as Eating on the property of the injured party. But if the animal <b>ate outside,</b> its owner is <b>exempt,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakhot</i> of Eating in the public domain. <b>What, is it not</b> that the case is one where the food was <b>rolling along,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> follows the location where it was actually eaten? The Gemara explains: <b>No, say</b> instead: <b>It ate,</b> and <b>for that which was</b> initially <b>inside</b> the private property, its owner is <b>liable</b> even if the food rolled out of the private property, <b>and for that which was</b> initially <b>outside,</b> its owner is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead that there is a different resolution: <b>When Rabbi Ḥiyya stated</b> his ruling it was with regard to a long <b>stalk of fodder [<i>de’aspasta</i>]</b> that was partly inside and partly outside at the time it was consumed, and as the animal ate it the entire stalk was pulled to where the animal was standing.
§ The mishna teaches: If the animal <b>ate garments</b> or vessels, the owner must pay for half the cost of the damage. In what case is this statement said? It is said when the animal ate them while located on the property of the injured party, but if he ate them in the public domain the owner of the animal is exempt from liability.
The Gemara asks: <b>To which</b> case is this referring? In which case is one exempt from liability if the damage occurred in the public domain? <b>Rav said:</b> It is referring to <b>all of</b> the cases. One is exempt from liability in the public domain even if his animal ate garments or vessels, despite the fact that this is an unusual thing for the animal to do and therefore eating garments or vessels should be classified as a case of Goring, which would normally result in liability when it occurs in the public domain. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Rav answers his own question by stating a principle: With regard to <b>anyone who deviates</b> from normative behavior in his actions, <b>if another came along</b> afterward <b>and deviates</b> from the norm <b>with regard to</b> the action the first has done and thereby causes damage to him, the one who causes the damage is <b>exempt</b> from liability. In this case, the injured party left his garments or vessels in the public domain and thereby deviated from normative behavior, and therefore the owner of the animal that acted atypically and ate them is exempt from liability.
<b>And Shmuel said: They taught</b> in the mishna that one is exempt from liability for damage caused in the public domain <b>only</b> in a case where his animal ate <b>fruit or vegetables,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakhot</i> of Eating in the public domain, <b>but</b> if the animal ate <b>garments or vessels</b> in the public domain, the owner is <b>liable</b> to pay for half the cost of the damage. Since this is atypical animal behavior, it is classified as a case of Goring, for which the owner of the animal is liable even if it occurs in the public domain.
<b>And similarly, Reish Lakish said,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav: The exemption discussed in the mishna was said in reference <b>to all of</b> the cases. <b>And Reish Lakish follows his</b> own line of <b>reasoning, as Reish Lakish says:</b> If there were <b>two cows in the public domain, one prone and one walking,</b> and the <b>walking</b> cow <b>kicked the prone</b> cow, its owner is <b>exempt</b> from liability; but if the <b>prone</b> cow kicked <b>the walking</b> cow, its owner is <b>liable.</b> This indicates that Reish Lakish accepts the principle: Anyone who deviates from normative behavior, if another came along afterward and deviates from the norm with regard to the action the first has done and thereby causes damage to him, the one who causes the damage is exempt. Since it is atypical behavior for a cow to lie down in the public domain, even if the walking cow also behaved atypically and kicked the prone cow, its owner is exempt from liability.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel: <b>They taught</b> in the mishna that one is exempt from liability in the public domain <b>only</b> if his animal ate <b>fruit or vegetables, but</b> if the animal ate <b>garments or vessels,</b> the owner is <b>liable</b> to pay for half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan does not accept Reish Lakish’s opinion even in</b> the case of the <b>two cows?</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, actually</b> it is possible that Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>accepts</b> the opinion of Reish Lakish, but he distinguishes between the cases. In the case of <b>garments,</b> it is <b>common</b> for <b>people to put their cloaks down</b> in the public domain <b>in order to rest [<i>umitpeḥi</i>],</b> and this is not considered atypical behavior. <b>But it is not common</b> for an <b>animal</b> to lie down in the public domain, and since this animal behaved in an atypical manner, no liability is borne by the owner of the walking cow for engaging in atypical behavior and kicking the prone cow.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And if</b> the animal <b>derives benefit</b> from eating another’s produce in the public domain, although the owner is exempt from paying for the damage it caused, nevertheless the owner of the animal <b>pays</b> for the benefit that it derives. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is this payment, i.e., how is it calculated? <b>Rabba says:</b> It is <b>the value of,</b> i.e., the amount one would pay, for an equal quantity of <b>stalks</b> of hay or straw. This is because the owner can claim that had his animal not eaten the produce, he would have fed it inexpensive straw, so the animal’s benefit is limited to the cost of the straw that it would have eaten. <b>Rava says:</b> If the animal ate barley, his owner must pay <b>the value of the barley,</b> i.e., as that is typical animal food, but <b>based on</b> the <b>cheapest</b> price available in the market.
The Gemara notes: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabba</b> and it <b>is taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava.</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabba: Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai said:</b> The animal’s owner <b>pays only the value of stalks</b> of straw.
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 1:7): <b>If</b> the animal <b>derived benefit</b> from eating another’s produce, the owner of the animal <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that it derived. How so?</b> If the animal <b>ate</b> one <b><i>kav</i> or two <i>kav</i></b> of grain, <b>we do not say</b> that <b>he should pay their value. Rather,</b> the court <b>estimates how much a person would pay in order to feed his animal</b> typical food <b>fit for it</b> to eat, <b>even if</b> this particular animal <b>does not usually</b> eat that food, as its owner gives it cheaper food. Therefore, if the animal ate barley, which is typical animal fare, even though it does not usually do so, its owner must pay compensation for the barley that was eaten, at its cheapest market price. <b>Therefore,</b> if the animal <b>ate wheat or</b> another <b>item that is detrimental to</b> it, so that it did not derive any benefit, if this occurred in the public domain the owner is <b>exempt</b> from all liability.
§ In connection to the principle stated in the mishna, that if the animal derives benefit the owner of the animal pays for the benefit that it derived, the Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥisda said to Rami bar Ḥama: You were not with us at night within</b> our <b>boundary when we raised dilemmas</b> concerning <b>exceptional matters.</b> Rami bar Ḥama <b>said</b> to him: <b>What</b> are the <b>exceptional matters</b> you discussed? Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him:</b> With regard to <b>one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge</b> or permission, <b>must he pay him rent</b> for living there <b>or does he not need to</b> pay him rent?
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this question? <b>If we say</b> that the case concerns <b>a courtyard that does not stand to be rented out,</b> i.e., if the squatter would not have lived there the owner would have kept it vacant, <b>and the man</b> squatting there is someone who would <b>not have rented</b> other living quarters because he has other lodgings available to him for free, then it is a case where <b>this</b> one, the squatter, <b>does not derive benefit, and that</b> one, the owner, <b>does not suffer a loss;</b> in that case certainly no payment is necessary. Rather, say that the discussion concerns a case of <b>a courtyard that stands to be rented out, and the man</b> squatting there would <b>have rented</b> other living quarters. If so, then this is a case where <b>this</b> one <b>derives benefit and that</b> one <b>suffers a loss,</b> and in that case he certainly must make payment. The dilemma was not with regard to either of these circumstances.
The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to raise the dilemma in the case of <b>a courtyard that does not stand to be rented out, but the man</b> squatting there <b>would have rented</b> other living quarters had he not squatted in this property. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case? Is the squatter legally <b>able to say to</b> the owner of the courtyard: <b>What loss have I caused you,</b> as you would not have rented it out anyway? <b>Or perhaps</b> the owner of the courtyard is legally <b>able to say</b> to the squatter:

Daf 20b

<b>You have derived benefit</b> from my property, as by living there you saved the money you otherwise would have had to pay in order to rent out a different courtyard, and therefore you must pay me for the benefit you derived.
Rami bar Ḥama <b>said to him:</b> This dilemma is not new; rather, <b>it is</b> discussed in <b>the mishna,</b> and the mishna already provided a solution. Rav Ḥisda asked him: To <b>which mishna</b> are you referring? Rami bar Ḥama <b>said to him: After you serve me,</b> I will tell you. Rav Ḥisda <b>took</b> hold of Rami bar Ḥama’s <b>scarf [<i>suderei</i>] and folded it</b>, as an act of service. Rami bar Ḥama then <b>said to him:</b> This is the mishna: <b>If</b> the animal <b>derives benefit,</b> the owner of the animal <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> the animal <b>derived.</b> This demonstrates that one who derives benefit must pay for the benefit he derives, even if the injured party is not entitled to payment for his loss.
<b>Rava said: How</b> little does <b>a man who has the assistance of his Lord have to worry or be concerned</b> about the possibility that his opinion may not be accepted, <b>as even though</b> the dilemma that was raised is in fact <b>not similar to</b> the case in <b>the mishna</b> quoted by Rami bar Ḥama, Rav Ḥisda nevertheless <b>accepted it from him. This</b> case in the mishna, about the animal eating produce in the public domain, is where <b>this one derives benefit and that one suffers a loss, and that</b> case of the squatter living in the courtyard, is where <b>this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rami bar Ḥama</b> think? Why does he equate the two cases? The Gemara explains: He holds that if <b>produce</b> is left <b>in the public domain without specification</b> with regard to its ownership, it is assumed that the owner <b>has rendered it ownerless.</b> The owner does not expect to derive benefit from the produce, and therefore when the animal ate it he suffered no loss. Consequently, it is a case where this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss, and it is comparable to the case of the squatter in the courtyard.
The Gemara attempts to cite conclusive evidence from another case: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 4b): If <b>one’s</b> fields <b>surround</b> the fields of <b>another on three sides, and he fenced in the first, the second, and the third</b> field, thereby providing protection also to the other man’s field, the court <b>does not obligate</b> the owner of the inner field to share in the costs of the fence, as he can claim that he does not derive benefit from it, since his field remains exposed on the fourth side. The Gemara infers: <b>But</b> this indicates that if his fields surrounded the inner field on all four sides, and the owner of the outer fields fenced the field on the <b>fourth</b> side as well, the court <b>does obligate</b> the owner of the inner field to share in the expenses.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that where <b>this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss,</b> the one who derives benefit is <b>obligated</b> to pay for that benefit. In this case, the owner of the inner field benefits from the fence while the owner of the outer field does not suffer a loss, because in any event he would have needed to build those fences, and the owner of the inner field is obligated to share in the expense. The Gemara rejects this: It <b>is different there</b> because the owner of the outer field <b>can say to</b> the owner of the inner field: <b>Your</b> field <b>caused me to have to</b> build the fence with <b>a larger circumference</b> than I would have otherwise needed to had your field not been there, and therefore your field caused me an additional expense. This case is therefore similar to those where this one derives benefit and that one suffers a loss.
The Gemara attempts another resolution: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the continuation of that mishna. <b>Rabbi Yosei said: If</b> the owner of <b>the surrounded,</b> i.e., inner, field <b>arose and enclosed the fourth</b> side on his own, the court <b>imposes upon him</b> the obligation to pay his share of <b>all</b> of it, as through his actions he demonstrated that he was interested in having the fence installed. The Gemara infers from this: The <b>reason</b> the court imposes upon him the obligation to pay his share of all of it is because the owner of <b>the surrounded</b> field arose and <b>enclosed</b> the fourth side himself. By inference, had the owner of <b>the surrounding</b> field built the fourth fence, the owner of the inner field would be <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that where <b>this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss,</b> the one who derives benefit is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara rejects this: It <b>is different there</b> because the owner of the inner field <b>can say to</b> the owner of the surrounding fields: <b>For me, the protection</b> of a fence <b>worth a dinar would have been sufficient;</b> I did not wish to pay for such an expensive fence.
The Gemara attempts another resolution: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 117a): If <b>a house and its upper story,</b> which belonged <b>to two</b> separate people, <b>collapsed,</b> necessitating that the entire structure be rebuilt, and <b>the owner of the upper story told the owner of the</b> lower story of the <b>house to build</b> the lower story again so that he could rebuild the upper story, but the owner of the lower story <b>does not want to</b> do so, <b>the owner of the upper story may build</b> the lower story of the <b>house and live in it until</b> the owner of the lower story <b>will pay him for his expenses,</b> and only then will he be required to vacate the lower story of the house and build the upper story.
The Gemara infers: It <b>is</b> all of <b>his expenses that the owner of the</b> lower story of the <b>house is obligated to</b> pay <b>him, and</b> he <b>does not</b> subtract from the amount compensation <b>for rent</b> for the time that the owner of the upper story lived in the lower story of the house. <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that where <b>this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss,</b> the one who derives benefit is <b>exempt,</b> as the owner of the upper story derived benefit from living in the lower story, while the owner of the lower story did not suffer a loss, since he said he did not need it. The Gemara rejects this proof: It <b>is different there because the</b> lower story of the <b>house is subjugated to the upper story,</b> because it also serves as the foundation of the upper story, and therefore the owner of the lower story of the house is obligated to provide lodging to the owner of the upper story in the interim.
The Gemara attempts another resolution. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the continuation of the mishna, in which Rabbi Yehuda disagrees with the first <i>tanna</i> and holds that the owner of the upper story may not reside in the lower story of the house without payment. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> A proof that the owner of the upper story must pay rent is from the <i>halakha</i> that <b>even this</b> one <b>who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge must pay him rent. Conclude from</b> the mishna that when <b>this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss,</b> the one who derives benefit is <b>obligated</b> to pay. The Gemara rejects this: It <b>is different there,</b> as there it is possible to claim that the owner of the lower story suffers a loss <b>due to the blackening of the walls,</b> as when a person lives in a home, the value of the house depreciates due to the use.
This dilemma was not successfully resolved so <b>they sent it</b> to the <b>academy of Rabbi Ami</b> to ask his opinion. Rabbi Ami <b>said: And what did</b> this squatter <b>do to</b> the owner? <b>What loss did he cause him? How did he damage him?</b> Rav Ami holds that if this one derives benefit and that one does not suffer a loss, no payment is necessary. When asked about this dilemma, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said: Let us consider the matter.</b> After waiting and not receiving a response <b>they sent</b> the question <b>to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba again. He said: They keep sending me this</b> dilemma; <b>had I found a response</b> to their question, <b>would I not have sent them</b> a reply? They should have realized that Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba did not have an answer for them.
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> discussed this matter: <b>Rav Kahana</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He need not pay him rent,</b> and <b>Rabbi Abbahu</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He must pay him rent.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said: This</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu,</b> citing Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>was not stated explicitly; rather,</b> it <b>was stated from an inference</b> that Rabbi Abbahu drew from something that Rabbi Yoḥanan said in a different context. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Me’ila</i> 5:4): If the treasurer of consecrated property <b>took</b> for himself <b>a stone or</b> a cross <b>beam</b> that had been <b>consecrated, he has not</b> violated the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. This is because his act of taking the stone or the beam has not effectively removed it from within the jurisdiction of Temple property, as any item under his control is in the possession of the Temple treasury.
If the treasurer <b>gave it to another</b> as a gift, <b>he</b> has then <b>misused</b> consecrated property, as he removed it from the possession of the Temple and conveyed it into the possession of another. But <b>the other</b> man, who received the item, has <b>not misused</b> a consecrated item until he actually uses the item. If the treasurer himself <b>built it into his house, he has not</b> violated the prohibition of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>until he has lived beneath it</b> for an amount of time <b>worth one <i>peruta</i>.</b>
<b>And Shmuel said: And this</b> is the <i>halakha</i> provided <b>that he placed it over the skylight,</b> as were he to have built it into the actual structure of the house, he would have violated the prohibition of misuse with the very act of construction, as by doing so he effects a change in the stone itself. By contrast, when he places the stone in a place from which it is easy to remove it and give it back, then as long as he has not lived beneath it, he has not, as yet, misused consecrated property.
<b>And Rabbi Abbahu sat before Rabbi Yoḥanan and</b> was <b>saying in the name of Shmuel: That is to say, one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge must pay him rent,</b> similar to the treasurer who resides beneath the consecrated beam without detracting from the value of the beam in any way but has nevertheless violated the prohibition of misuse since he has derived personal benefit from it. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>remained silent</b> and offered <b>him</b> no reply.
Rabbi Abbahu <b>thought</b> that <b>since he was silent,</b> this must mean <b>he concedes to his</b> conclusion, and therefore, from then on he would cite this opinion in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>But</b> that is <b>not so.</b> The reason Rabbi Yoḥanan was silent was because <b>he did not pay attention</b> to Rabbi Abbahu and did not bother to contradict his opinion on the issue. In truth Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion is as was reported in his name by Rav Kahana, that a squatter living on someone else’s premises without his permission and without causing him any loss does not need to pay the owner any rent.
The Gemara explains the distinction between that case and the case of the consecrated stone or beam. The reason the treasurer of consecrated property is considered to have misused consecrated property by deriving benefit from it is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabba, as Rabba says: Consecrated</b> property from which one derived benefit <b>without</b> the Temple treasury’s <b>knowledge</b>

Daf 21a

is <b>similar</b> to an action involving non-sacred property belonging to <b>an ordinary person,</b> which was performed <b>with</b> the owner’s <b>knowledge</b> and against his wishes. This is because consecrated property belongs to the Almighty, and it is therefore meaningless to speak of a situation where the owner is unaware of what is being done. Consequently, anyone who derives benefit from consecrated property is in violation of the prohibition of misuse, but it cannot be inferred from this that one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge must pay him rent.
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Zavda sent</b> a message <b>to Mari bar Mar</b> saying: <b>Raise</b> the following <b>dilemma before Rav Huna:</b> Does <b>one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge need to pay him rent or not? In the meantime,</b> before he was able to respond to the question, <b>Rav Huna died.</b>
<b>Rabba, son of Rav Huna, said to him</b> in response to the question that was asked of his father: <b>So did my father, my Master, say in the name of Rav: He does not need to pay him rent. And</b> he also stated another <i>halakha</i>: <b>One who rents a house from Reuven must pay rent to Shimon.</b> The Gemara is puzzled: <b>Shimon? What does he</b> have to <b>do</b> with this? The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what he is <b>saying,</b> i.e., what he means: If it <b>is discovered that the house</b> he rented did not actually belong to Reuven but rather it was <b>Shimon’s,</b> he <b>must pay rent to</b> Shimon.
The Gemara questions this statement: Did Rav Huna state <b>two</b> contradictory <i>halakhot</i>? On the one hand he says that one who resides in a courtyard without the owner’s knowledge does not need to pay rent, but on the other hand he says that if it is discovered that the true owner of a rented house was someone else, and therefore the tenant was living in another’s courtyard without the owner’s knowledge, he is obligated to pay him rent. The Gemara resolves the difficulty: <b>This</b> second <i>halakha</i>, which stated that he is obligated to pay rent, is referring to a courtyard that <b>stands to be rented out,</b> while <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i>, which stated that he is not obligated to pay rent, is referring to a courtyard that <b>does not stand to be rented out.</b>
<b>It was also stated: Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says: One who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge does not need to pay him rent, and one who rents a house from the residents of the city must pay rent to the owners.</b> The Gemara is puzzled: <b>Owners? What do they</b> have to <b>do</b> with this? The case concerns one who rents a property from the residents of the city, i.e., the house is public property. The Gemara explains: <b>This is</b> what he <b>said:</b> If it is <b>discovered that</b> the house <b>did have owners</b> and was not public property, the renters <b>must pay rent to</b> those owners.
The Gemara wonders about this: Did he state <b>two</b> contradictory <i>halakhot</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> second <i>halakha</i>, which stated that he is obligated to pay rent, is referring to a courtyard that <b>stands to be rented out,</b> while <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i>, which stated that he does not need to pay rent, is referring to a courtyard that <b>does not stand to be rented out.</b>
<b>Rav Seḥora says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: One who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge does not need to pay him rent because it is stated:</b> “Desolation remains in the city, <b>and the gate is stricken unto ruin”</b> (Isaiah 24:12), i.e., a house that is not lived in will collapse at some point due to neglect. Consequently, one who lives inside an otherwise uninhabited house is providing a service to the homeowner, as he maintains the house and prevents it from falling apart. <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said: I saw this</b> ruin <b>and it gores like an ox,</b> i.e., it is devastating. <b>Rav Yosef stated</b> a similar idea: <b>A home that is lived in is settled</b> and safeguarded, while a home that is not lived in has no one to look after it and maintain it.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> what Rav said and what Rav Yosef said? The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to a house that the homeowner <b>uses</b> to store <b>wood and straw.</b> The house is not empty and desolate but there is nobody living in it. According to Rav Yosef’s reasoning, a squatter there would not have to pay rent to the homeowner.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who built a mansion [<i>apadna</i>] on a garbage heap [<i>akilkalta</i>] belonging to orphans,</b> and <b>Rav Naḥman confiscated his mansion from him</b> as he did not pay the owners of the property. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman holds</b> that <b>one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge must pay him rent?</b> The Gemara rejects this: No, there is no proof taken from this case, because it was a unique situation. <b>In that</b> case <b>Carmanians,</b> nomadic tribes, <b>were initially living on</b> the property, <b>and they would pay the orphans a small amount</b> for the use of the land, and when this man built his mansion he removed the Carmanians from there. Rav Naḥman had <b>said to</b> the man who built the mansion: <b>Go and appease the orphans</b> with regard to their lost income, <b>but he did not pay attention</b> to the ruling. Therefore, <b>Rav Naḥman confiscated his mansion from him.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: Under <b>what</b> circumstances does the owner of the animal <b>pay</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> his animal <b>derived?</b> If the animal ate produce in the public square in the area before the storefronts, the owner of the animal pays for the food from which it benefits. If the animal ate from food placed at the side of the public square, which is not a public thoroughfare, the owner of the animal pays for what it damaged, as the legal status of that area is like that of the property of the injured party. <b>Rav said:</b> When the mishna says that the owner of the animal pays for what it damaged, it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>turns</b> its head to reach the food but the animal itself is standing completely inside the public domain and it eats while standing there. <b>And Shmuel said: Even if</b> it is standing in the public domain and it <b>turns</b> its head to eat from food placed at the side of the public square, its owner is <b>also exempt,</b> as the animal itself is in the public domain.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, how can you find</b> a case in which the owner is <b>liable</b> to pay for all of the damage caused when his animal ate from food placed at the side of the public square, as indicated by the mishna? The Gemara answers: <b>For example,</b> when an animal <b>leaves the</b> public <b>square and goes and stands at the side of the</b> public <b>square,</b> and eats the food stored there. In that case its owner certainly pays for what it damaged, as this area is comparable to the property of the injured party.
<b>And there are those who teach this <i>halakha</i></b> as <b>an independent</b> dispute and not as an explanation of the mishna: If an animal is standing in the public domain and <b>turns</b> its head to eat from food placed at the side of the public square, <b>Rav says:</b> Its owner is <b>liable, and Shmuel says:</b> Its owner is <b>exempt.</b> The Sages asked: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel,</b> with regard to that which was said in the <b>mishna, that its owner pays for what it damaged, how can you find a case in which its owner will be liable?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>For example,</b> when an animal <b>leaves the</b> public <b>square and goes and stands at the side of the</b> public <b>square,</b> and eats the food stored there.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak raises an objection</b> to this explanation of Rav’s opinion: The mishna says that if the animal ate produce <b>from the entrance of the store,</b> its owner <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> the animal <b>derived,</b> as the status of a store entrance is like that of the public domain. <b>How can you find these</b> circumstances? It is <b>obvious</b> that the discussion in this case concerns an animal that <b>turns</b> its head from the public domain to the entrance of the store, <b>and</b> the Master <b>says</b> that the owner of the animal <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> the animal <b>derived.</b> Evidently, for <b>the benefit that</b> the animal <b>derived, yes,</b> this is what the owner pays, but he does <b>not</b> pay for that <b>which it damaged.</b>
Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>raised the objection, and he resolved it</b> by explaining that the case in the mishna is one where a store <b>is located on a corner</b> and it is situated in a way that some of the produce there would be in an animal’s path as it turns the corner, and therefore the animal would not need to turn its head away from the public domain in order to eat the produce.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who state</b> a different explanation of the dispute between Rav and Shmuel. In a case <b>where it turns</b> its head to eat from the sides of the public square, <b>everyone agrees that</b> its owner is <b>liable</b> to pay the full cost of the damage. <b>When they disagree</b> it is with regard to a case <b>where one allocates space from his property,</b> as he does not have a use for it, and he adds this space <b>to the public domain</b> by leaving it accessible for the public to use, and the damage took place in that area. The dispute is about whether the area is categorized as private property or the public domain.
<b>And this is what was stated,</b> meaning this was their dispute: <b>Rav says</b> that in the mishna, <b>they taught</b> that one is liable <b>only</b> in a case where his animal <b>turns</b> its head to the sides of the public square, as this area is categorized as private property, <b>but if one allocated some space from his property</b> and added it <b>to the public domain</b> and the damage happened there, the owner is <b>exempt,</b> as that area is treated as part of the public domain. <b>And Shmuel says: Even if he allocates space from his property</b> and adds it <b>to the public domain,</b> the owner of the animal is <b>liable</b> as the damage took place in an area with the legal status of private property.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say they disagree with regard to</b> the question of damage classified as <b>Pit</b> that one dug <b>inside one’s</b> own <b>domain</b> and then declared the area ownerless? <b>Rav, who says</b> that the owner of the animal is <b>exempt</b> for eating the produce placed in an area that the owner added to the public domain, <b>holds</b> that if one digs <b>a pit</b> or creates an obstacle that can cause damage <b>within his</b> own <b>property</b> and he then declares his property to be ownerless, he is <b>liable</b> for any damage that is caused by the pit, as now that it is in the public domain, he bears the responsibility for it. Similarly, the produce is viewed as if it is in the public domain, and the animal’s owner is exempt.
<b>And Shmuel, who says</b> that the owner of an animal is <b>liable</b> for eating the produce placed in an area that the owner added to the public domain, <b>holds</b> that if one digs <b>a pit within his</b> own <b>property</b> and he then declares his property to be ownerless, he is <b>exempt,</b> as he dug the pit when the property was his. Similarly, the produce is viewed as if it is in the property of the injured party, and the animal’s owner is liable.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: Actually, I will say to you</b>

Daf 21b

that <b>usually,</b> if one digs <b>a pit within his</b> own <b>property</b> and he then declares his property to be ownerless, he is <b>exempt,</b> as he dug the pit when the property was his. <b>But here</b> it <b>is different, because</b> here the owner of the animal can <b>say</b> to the owner of the produce: <b>It is not all in your power to bring your produce close to the public domain and to</b> also <b>hold my ox liable for</b> eating <b>it.</b>
<b>And Shmuel</b> can <b>say: Usually,</b> if one digs <b>a pit</b> or creates an obstacle that can cause damage <b>within his</b> own <b>property</b> and he then declares his property to be ownerless, he is <b>liable</b> for any damage that is caused by the pit. <b>As</b> with regard to the <b>pit, granted, it is possible to say</b> that <b>he was not aware,</b> meaning the injured party was not thinking about the possibility that there may be a pit there that could cause him harm, and therefore the one who dug the pit is liable. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>produce</b> that is spread out over the ground, <b>can it be said that</b> the animal <b>was not aware</b> of it? It cannot be, because the animal <b>sees</b> the produce.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that actually, the amoraic dispute about an animal that <b>turns</b> its head and eats produce at the side of the road <b>is</b> the subject of a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If an animal <b>ate</b> produce <b>from the</b> public <b>square,</b> the owner of the animal <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> the animal <b>derived;</b> but if it ate <b>from the sides of the</b> public <b>square,</b> he <b>pays</b> for that <b>which it damaged.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda.</b> But <b>Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Elazar say: It is not typical</b> for an animal <b>to eat</b> in the public domain <b>but only to walk</b> there. Consequently, the owner is liable.
Initially, the Gemara understands Rabbi Yosei’s opinion as also referring to a situation in which the animal eats from the sides of the public square, and since this is so, it seems that the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei is</b> the same as that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Meir, and the mishna presents their opinions as differing. <b>Rather,</b> it is clear that <b>there is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to a case in which the animal <b>turns</b> its head to eat. <b>The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that with regard to an animal that <b>turns</b> its head, the owner of the animal <b>also pays</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> the animal <b>derived, while Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that he <b>pays</b> for that <b>which it damaged.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> it is possible to say <b>that everyone</b> agrees about the <i>halakha</i> in the case of an animal that <b>turns</b> its head, <b>either in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav or in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel. And here they disagree</b> about the exemption inferred from the verse: <b>“It consumed in the field of another”</b> (Exodus 22:4), which renders the owner of an animal liable for damage classified as Eating. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that only if it ate from private property is its owner liable, as the verse stating the owner’s liability means: <b>“And it consumed in the field of another,” but not</b> when it eats <b>in the public domain. And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yosei, <b>holds</b> it means that even if it ate from the public domain its owner is liable, as the verse stating the owner’s liability means: <b>“And it consumed in the field of another,” but not</b> when it eats <b>in the domain of the one responsible for the damage;</b> only if the animal ate produce of another that was on the property of the animal’s owner, is its owner is exempt.
The Gemara challenges this: But not when it eats <b>in the domain of the one responsible for the damage?</b> What is the novelty in this statement? <b>Let</b> the owner of the animal <b>say</b> to the owner of the produce: <b>What is your produce doing on my property?</b> The owner would certainly not be liable if the produce is damaged in that case. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that the difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to the dispute <b>between Ilfa and Rabbi Oshaya</b> concerning an animal that ate produce from the back of another animal or the like. Rabbi Meir holds that one is never liable for damage classified as Eating in the public domain, even if his animal ate from the back of another, and Rabbi Yosei holds that if it ate off the back of another animal, this is equivalent to Eating from the property of the injured party.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a dog or a goat that jumped from a rooftop and broke vessels</b> while doing so, their owners <b>must pay the full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> to the vessels <b>because</b> these animals <b>are</b> deemed <b>forewarned</b> concerning to jumping. With regard to <b>a dog that took a cake</b> that had been baked directly on hot coals, <b>and went to a stack</b> of grain to eat it, <b>and it ate the cake</b> and at the same time <b>ignited the stack</b> of grain with a coal that it had taken along with the cake, the owner of the dog must <b>pay the full</b> cost of the <b>damage for the cake, and</b> he must <b>pay for half</b> the cost of <b>the damage to the stack</b> of grain.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the mishna: <b>The reason</b> the owners must pay the full cost of the damage is <b>because</b> the animals <b>jumped</b> off the rooftop. This indicates that if <b>they fell</b> off the roof, they would be <b>exempt</b> from all liability despite his obligation to keep them from climbing onto the roof and jumping down from there. <b>Apparently,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that in an incident that <b>begins with negligence,</b> meaning carelessness or even an intention to cause damage, <b>and ends in an accident,</b> the one who caused the damage is <b>exempt,</b> as in this case the owner was careless in allowing the animals to go to the rooftop, but since they did not jump off the roof but rather fell accidentally, he is exempt.
The Gemara notes: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If a dog or a goat jumped from a rooftop and broke vessels</b> while doing so, their owners must <b>pay the full</b> cost of the <b>damage. If they fell</b> from there, they are <b>exempt</b> from all liability. The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that if an incident <b>begins with negligence and ends in an accident,</b> the one who caused the damage is <b>exempt, but according to the one who says</b> that in such a case he is <b>liable, what can be said?</b> It seems that this <i>baraita</i> constitutes conclusive proof against that opinion.
The Gemara answers: The case in the <i>baraita</i> is a case <b>where the vessels were brought close to the wall</b> by their owners, <b>so</b> that <b>when</b> the animals <b>jump</b> off the rooftop <b>in</b> an ordinary <b>leap they do not fall on top of them,</b> and the vessels broke because the animal fell and didn’t jump. <b>And</b> since in an ordinary circumstance no damage should occur, <b>this</b> case does <b>not even begin with negligence.</b> Since the damage was caused by falling, the entire case is ruled an accident.
<b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava: Sometimes</b> one can be <b>obligated</b> to pay <b>even</b> in a case where the animals <b>fell</b> from the wall of their owner’s house. <b>You find</b> such a case <b>where the wall was unstable,</b> and the owner was negligent in allowing the animals to go up to the roof due to the danger of the wall collapsing. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Is it <b>because it should have occurred to him that bricks may fall</b> from the wall and break the vessels? But <b>ultimately, no bricks fell and</b> instead <b>the</b> animals <b>fell,</b> so <b>this is</b> actually a case that <b>begins with negligence and ends in an accident.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> a case of <b>a narrow wall,</b> in which case it is clear that if when they climb up there they will fall, and that is why he is liable for the damage they cause by falling.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If a dog or a goat jumped from below to</b> something that was <b>above</b> them and thereby caused damage, their owners are <b>exempt,</b> as this is atypical behavior. But if they jumped <b>from above to below,</b> their owners are <b>liable</b> to pay the full cost of any damage they cause, as this is typical behavior. <b>If a person or a chicken jumped</b> and broke something, <b>regardless of whether they jumped from above to below or from below to above, they are liable.</b>

Daf 22a

The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If a dog or a goat jumped,</b> regardless of <b>whether</b> they jumped <b>from above to below or from below to above,</b> their owners are <b>exempt</b> from all liability? <b>Rav Pappa interpreted</b> it in the following way: Their manners of movement <b>were changed</b> from the typical manner of movement for their species. The <b>dog</b> moved <b>by leaping [<i>bizkira</i>],</b> while the <b>goat</b> moved <b>by climbing [<i>bisrikha</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, why</b> are the owners <b>exempt</b> from liability? After all, they still caused damage. The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> does not intend to say that they are completely exempt, but that they are <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>the full</b> cost of the <b>damage; they are,</b> however, <b>liable</b> to pay <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> in any case of damage caused by atypical behavior, as such acts are classified as Goring.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>a dog that took</b> a cake that had been baked directly on hot coals, and went to a stack of grain to eat it, and it ate the cake and at the same time ignited the stack of grain with a coal that it had taken along with the cake, the owner of the dog must pay the full cost of the damage for the cake, and he must pay for half the cost of the damage to the stack of grain.
With regard to damage caused by a fire lit by one person spreading to a location other than where it was lit, the Gemara cites a dispute among the <i>amora’im</i>: <b>It was stated: Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> His liability for damage caused by <b>his fire is due to</b> its similarity to <b>his arrows,</b> meaning that damage caused by a fire in a location other than where it was lit is comparable to damage caused by an arrow shot at a distant target. <b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> His liability for the damage caused by <b>his fire is due to</b> its similarity to <b>his property;</b> he is responsible for this damage just as he is responsible for damage caused elsewhere by any of his possessions, e.g., one of his animals.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Reish Lakish did not state</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b> The Gemara answers: He could have <b>said to you</b> that fire is not comparable to an arrow, as <b>an arrow proceeds</b> as a result <b>of his</b> direct <b>force,</b> while <b>this</b> fire <b>does not proceed</b> as a result <b>of his</b> direct <b>force,</b> but requires a wind to carry it from the location where it was lit to the location of the damage. The Gemara asks about the other opinion: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan did not state</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish?</b> The Gemara answers: He could have <b>said to you</b> that one’s fire is not comparable to his possessions, as <b>property is</b> a tangible <b>substance</b> but <b>this</b> fire <b>is not</b> a tangible <b>substance.</b>
The Gemara attempts to settle the dispute: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>a dog that took a cake</b> that had been baked directly on hot coals, and went to a stack of grain to eat it, and it ate the cake and at the same time ignited the stack of grain with a coal that it had taken along with the cake, the owner of the dog must pay the full cost of the damage for the cake, and he must pay for half the cost of the damage to the stack of grain. <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that one’s liability for damage caused by <b>his fire is due to</b> its similarity to <b>his arrows,</b> this fire is similar to <b>the arrows of the dog,</b> and therefore he must pay for half the cost of the damage caused by the dog’s force, as in a case of pebbles.
<b>But according to the one who says</b> that one’s liability for damage caused by <b>his fire is due to</b> its similarity to <b>his property, this fire</b> is <b>not the property of the owner of the dog;</b> rather, it is the property of the owner of the cake, so why is the owner of the dog liable?
The Gemara answers: <b>Reish Lakish</b> could have <b>said to you: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case where the dog took the coal and did not place the cake on the stack, rather <b>it threw it</b> onto the stack. The ruling of the mishna is: <b>For the cake</b> which the dog ate, the owner <b>must pay the full</b> cost of the <b>damage,</b> and <b>for the</b> specific <b>spot</b> on the stack of grain that was damaged by the throwing of the <b>coal</b> there, the owner must <b>pay for half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> as in a case of pebbles. <b>And for the stack</b> of grain <b>as a whole,</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> because his liability for damage caused by the spread of the fire is due to its similarity to his property, and in this case it was not his property.
<b>But Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> can explain the mishna in a more straightforward manner. It is discussing a case <b>where</b> the dog <b>placed</b> the cake with the coal directly on the stack of grain in order to eat the cake. Accordingly, the owner of the dog must <b>pay the full</b> cost of the <b>damage for the cake and for the</b> specific <b>spot</b> where the <b>coal</b> was put down, as these cases of damage were caused directly by the dog. <b>And for</b> the rest of <b>the stack</b> of grain, he must <b>pay for half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> because in Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion one is liable for the damage caused by fire due to its similarity to arrows shot by his force. The damage to the rest of the stack of grain is an indirect result of the dog’s force, and therefore his liability is according the <i>halakhot</i> of pebbles.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (62b): In the case of <b>a camel</b> that was <b>laden with flax and was passing through the public domain,</b> and <b>its flax extended into a store</b> at the edge of the public domain, <b>and</b> the flax <b>caught fire from a lamp</b> in the store <b>belonging to the storekeeper, and</b> as a result of the burning flax the camel <b>set fire to the building</b> together with all its contents, <b>the owner of the camel</b> is <b>liable</b> for the damage. But if <b>the storekeeper placed his lamp outside</b> in the public domain, thereby causing the flax on the camel to catch fire, and consequently the building was set on fire, <b>the storekeeper</b> is <b>liable. Rabbi Yehuda says: In</b> a case where the lamp placed outside was <b>a Hanukkah lamp,</b> the storekeeper is <b>exempt</b> from liability, as there is a mitzva to place a Hanukkah lamp outside.
<b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that one’s liability for the damage caused by <b>his fire is due to</b> its similarity to <b>his arrows,</b> the fire in the store <b>is</b> similar to <b>the arrows of the camel,</b> and that is why the camel’s owner is liable. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that liability for the damage <b>is due to</b> its similarity to <b>his property, this fire</b> is <b>not the property of the owner of the camel.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Reish Lakish</b> could have <b>said to you: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the camel moved the burning flax around and <b>ignited the entire building,</b> lighting one spot after another. The fire did not need to spread since the camel directly set the building on fire in each of those spots, and therefore this case is comparable to that of a dog who moved the coal around from place to place.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If <b>the storekeeper placed his lamp outside, the storekeeper</b> is <b>liable. And if</b> the case is one <b>where</b> the camel <b>ignited</b> the entire building, spot by spot, <b>why</b> is the storekeeper <b>liable?</b> His fire did not spread through the building; it was the camel that moved it around from one place to another. The Gemara answers: The case is one <b>where</b> the camel did not move around, but rather <b>stood</b> still, but since there was an extremely large load of flax on its back, once it caught fire it ignited the entire building simultaneously.
The Gemara asks: If the camel <b>stood</b> without moving from place to place, but did shift the load on its back and thereby <b>ignited</b> the entire building, <b>all the more so</b> it should be <b>that the storekeeper</b> should be <b>exempt</b> from any liability <b>and the owner of</b> the <b>camel</b> should be <b>liable,</b> as it was his responsibility to move the camel away from there. <b>Rav Huna bar Manoah said in the name of Rav Ika: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the camel <b>stood</b> still in order <b>to urinate</b> and while doing so set the building ablaze; in that case the incident is deemed an accident as the owner could not have moved the camel from the spot.

Daf 22b

Consequently, in <b>the first clause,</b> the <b>owner of the camel</b> is <b>liable,</b> as <b>he should not have overloaded</b> the camel with flax to such a degree that it extended out so far from the sides that it could catch fire and ignite the store. But in <b>the latter clause,</b> the <b>storekeeper</b> is <b>liable, as he should not have placed</b> the <b>lamp outside.</b>
The Gemara attempts again to resolve the dispute: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a mishna (61b): With regard to <b>one who ignites a stack</b> of grain, <b>and there was a goat tied to</b> the stack, <b>and</b> there was also a Canaanite <b>slave adjacent to it</b> who was not tied to it, <b>and</b> both the goat and the slave <b>were burned</b> together <b>with</b> the stack of grain and killed, the one who ignited the fire is <b>liable</b> to pay compensation for both the stack and the goat, but he is exempt from paying for the slave because the slave should have run from the fire. Conversely, if the <b>slave was tied to</b> the stack <b>and</b> there was <b>a goat adjacent to it</b> that was not tied to it, <b>and</b> the slave and the goat <b>were burned</b> together <b>with</b> the stack of grain, the one who ignited the fire is completely <b>exempt</b> from payment for damage because he is liable to receive capital punishment for murder, and he is punished only for the greater transgression.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that one’s liability for the damage caused by <b>his fire is due to</b> its similarity to <b>his arrows, due to that</b> reasoning he is <b>exempt</b> for the damage to the stack of grain in the second case, because it is as if he killed the slave with his arrows and consequently became subject to receive court-imposed capital punishment, and one who is subject to the death penalty is not liable to pay monetary compensation for the same act, as he receives the greater punishment of the two. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that liability for damage caused by <b>his fire is due to</b> its similarity to <b>his property, why</b> is he <b>exempt? If his ox,</b> which is his possession, <b>were to kill a slave, would he also not be liable</b> to pay for the damage?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> could have <b>said to you: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he lit the body of the slave on fire,</b> consequently becoming subject to the death penalty as would anyone who kills a slave, <b>and</b> therefore <b>he receives the greater</b> punishment, the death penalty, but he does not also have to pay for the damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, what</b> is the purpose <b>of stating</b> this; what novel idea is it supposed to teach? One who lit a slave on fire is most certainly a murderer, and a murderer is exempt from paying for damage caused while committing the murder. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> for the case <b>where the goat</b> belonged <b>to one</b> person <b>and the slave</b> belonged <b>to a</b> different person; in that case one might have thought that since payment is due to someone other than the owner of the murdered slave, he would be required to pay the owner of the goat, despite being subject to the death penalty for killing the slave. Therefore, this mishna teaches that since he committed one act, for which he is liable to receive the death penalty, he is exempt from paying compensation to anyone as a result of that act.
The Gemara attempts another resolution: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a mishna (59b): <b>One who sends a fire,</b> i.e., places a burning object, <b>in the hand of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor</b> is <b>exempt</b> for any damage later caused by the fire <b>according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven,</b> meaning that he would not be held liable in court, but nevertheless he remains responsible to pay for what he has done.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that one’s liability for the damage caused by <b>his fire is due to</b> its similarity to <b>his arrows,</b> this case <b>is</b> similar to the damage caused by <b>the arrows of a deaf-mute</b> or an imbecile or a minor, and this is why the one who gave them the fire is exempt from liability. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that one’s liability for the damage caused by <b>his fire is due to</b> its similarity to <b>his property, if he were to convey his ox to a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, would he also not be liable?</b> That is impossible, as there is an explicit statement in a <i>baraita</i> (10a) saying that he would be liable.
The Gemara answers: But it <b>was stated</b> already <b>about this that Reish Lakish says in the name of Ḥizkiyya: They taught</b> that one is exempt from the damage caused by a fire that he had entrusted in the care of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor <b>only</b> in a case where <b>he conveyed a coal to him and</b> the deaf-mute <b>fanned</b> the coal into a flame, which then caused damage. <b>But</b> if he conveyed an open <b>flame to him</b> and it caused damage, the one who gave him the flame is <b>liable. What is the reason</b> for this? This is because the <b>damage is self-evident,</b> i.e., it is clear that damage will ensue, and it is as if he placed a goring ox under his care. Therefore, if one’s liability for damage classified as Fire is due to its similarity to damage caused by one’s property, he would be liable in this case.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who holds that one’s liability for damage caused by fire is due to its similarity to one’s arrows, <b>says</b> that he is <b>exempt even</b> if he conveyed an open <b>flame</b> to him, because <b>he holds</b> that <b>it is the deaf-mute’s handling</b> of the flame <b>that causes</b> the blaze, and it is therefore not similar to a case of arrows shot; the one who conveys a fire to the deaf-mute <b>does not become liable</b> for the damage <b>until he hands</b> the deaf-mute <b>chopped wood, kindling chips, and a lamp,</b> as in that case, the damage that will ensue is self-evident and it is as if he started the blaze himself.
<b>Rava said: A verse and a <i>baraita</i></b> both <b>support Rabbi Yoḥanan’s</b> opinion. The <b>verse</b> supporting his opinion is <b>as it is written: “If fire breaks out”</b> (Exodus 22:5), indicating that the fire <b>breaks out on its own;</b> yet the verse continues, <b>“the one who ignited the fire shall pay,”</b> indicating that the fire was ignited by a person. <b>Conclude from</b> the verse that one’s liability for the damage caused by <b>his fire is due to</b> its similarity to damage caused by <b>his arrows,</b> as the resolution of the apparent inconsistency in the verse is that it relates to the individual as if he had himself started the blaze, and that is why he is obligated to pay for the damage.
The <b><i>baraita</i></b> supporting his opinion is <b>as it is taught: The verse</b> concerning liability for a fire <b>opened</b>

Daf 23a

<b>with</b> a reference to <b>damage</b> caused by <b>one’s possessions,</b> as it is written: “If fire breaks out,” indicating that his responsibility for the fire is the same as his responsibility for any of his possessions that cause damage, <b>and it concludes with</b> a reference to <b>damage</b> caused by <b>one’s body,</b> as the verse refers to the person by calling him “the one who ignited the fire,” <b>telling you</b> that his liability for the damage caused by <b>his fire is due to</b> its similarity to <b>his arrows.</b>
<b>Rava said</b> that <b>Abaye</b> raised <b>a difficulty: According to the one who says</b> that one’s liability for the damage caused by <b>his fire is due to</b> its similarity to <b>his arrows, how can you find</b> that <b>the Merciful One exempted</b> one from liability for <b>concealed</b> items damaged by a <b>fire?</b> If one caused damage by shooting an arrow, he would be equally liable for damaging both exposed and concealed items. Consequently, if one’s liability for the damage caused by his fire is due to its similarity to his arrows, he should similarly be liable for concealed items damaged by a fire.
<b>And</b> it was <b>satisfactory for him,</b> i.e., Abaye resolved the difficulty. He explained that the exemption from liability for concealed items damaged by a fire applies in a case <b>where a fire broke out in that</b> same <b>courtyard, and</b> afterward the <b>fence</b> separating this courtyard from the neighbor’s courtyard <b>collapsed,</b> but <b>not due to the fire, and</b> therefore the fire <b>spread and ignited</b> items <b>and caused damage in another courtyard.</b> In such a circumstance he would be exempt <b>because there,</b> in this case, it is as if <b>his arrows were depleted,</b> i.e., he bears responsibility for the fire that he had started, which initially was confined to his courtyard alone. The fire that spread to the neighboring courtyard is not similar to his arrows, and therefore he is exempt.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>If that is so,</b> he should be exempt not only with regard to concealed items but also <b>with regard to exposed</b> items that were damaged by the fire, as <b>his arrows are also depleted</b> when the fire spreads and causes damage. If his exemption is due to fact that the damage was caused because the wall that had separated the two courtyards had collapsed, there should be no distinction between exposed and concealed items.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>the one who holds</b> that one’s liability for the damage caused by his fire is <b>due to</b> its similarity to <b>his arrows also holds</b> that his liability is <b>due to</b> the fire’s similarity to <b>his property.</b> Consequently, it remains possible for a circumstance to exist in which one will be exempt from liability for damaging concealed items and yet be held liable for exposed items. <b>For example, if he had</b> the ability to repair the breach <b>and fence</b> in the courtyard again <b>but he did not fence</b> it in, he will be liable, <b>as there, it</b> is similar to a case where <b>his ox</b> was in danger of escaping from his property and <b>he did not strike</b> it <b>in its face</b> to hold it back, and therefore he is liable for any ensuing damage. In this case, however, the fire is not similar to his arrows since it was not responsible for the collapse of the fence, and therefore he is exempt from damage caused to concealed items, according to the <i>halakhot</i> of Fire.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this conclusion, <b>since the one who holds</b> that one’s liability for the damage caused by his fire is <b>due to</b> its similarity to <b>his arrows also holds</b> that his liability is <b>due to</b> its similarity to <b>his property, what</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish?
The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to <b>holding him liable</b> for the additional <b>four types of indemnity</b> in a case where the fire injured a person. In such an instance Rabbi Yoḥanan would require, in addition to the costs of the damage itself, payments for pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation, as in any case of personal injury, given that Rabbi Yoḥanan considers Fire to be no different than an arrow he had shot at the injured party.
§ The mishna teaches that he must <b>pay</b> the full cost of the damage <b>for the cake</b> the dog ate but must pay for only half the cost of the damage to the burned stack of grain. The Gemara elucidates: <b>Who</b> is the one <b>obligated</b> to pay for the cake? The <b>owner of</b> the <b>dog.</b> The Gemara challenges this: <b>But</b> why not <b>let</b> the <b>owner of</b> the <b>coal also be liable,</b> as he shares some of the responsibility, being that he did not safeguard his coal and it ultimately caused damage? The Gemara answers: The case under discussion is one <b>where</b> the owner of the coal <b>safeguarded his coal</b> properly.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the case is one <b>where he safeguarded his coal</b> properly, <b>what does the dog want,</b> i.e., what is it doing <b>there?</b> If the dog was able to get in there, it cannot be that the owner of the coal safeguarded it properly. The Gemara answers: The case is one <b>where</b> the dog <b>burrowed</b> under the fence, entered the property, and took the cake and the coal. <b>Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, said: That is to say</b> that <b>ordinary doors are</b> deemed <b>vulnerable to being burrowed</b> under <b>by a dog</b> because if it would be atypical for a dog to burrow under the door, the owner of the dog would be exempt from payment. Therefore, it must be that it is typical behavior for a dog to burrow beneath a door, and therefore it was incumbent upon the owner of the door to prevent it from causing damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>Where did it eat</b> the cake? <b>If we say that it ate it</b> after placing it <b>on a stack</b> of grain <b>belonging to another,</b> i.e., someone other than the owner of the cake, then he should not be liable for the damage to the cake under the <i>halakhot</i> of Eating, <b>as</b> in order to hold someone liable <b>we require</b> fulfillment of scenario described in the verse: <b>“And it consumed in the field of another”</b> (Exodus 22:4), meaning that an act of damage classified as Eating must be caused on the property of the injured party, <b>and that is not</b> the case in this instance. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> only in the case <b>where</b> the dog <b>ate</b> the cake after placing it <b>on a stack</b> of grain owned <b>by the owner of the cake,</b> and that is why the dog’s owner is liable, as it ate it while on the property of the injured party.
§ The Gemara suggests: From here it is possible to <b>resolve</b> a dilemma and prove <b>that</b> the <b>mouth of a cow</b>

Daf 23b

<b>is like the courtyard of the injured</b> party, i.e., it is not a separate domain from the place in which the animal is eating. <b>As if</b> the mouth of the animal were to be considered <b>like the courtyard of the one responsible for the damage, let</b> the owner of the dog <b>say to</b> the injured party: <b>What is your bread doing in my dog’s mouth?</b> The dog’s mouth is my domain, and I am not liable for damage classified as Eating done to your property in my domain.
The Gemara notes: The need for this type of inference arises from the fact <b>that a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Is the mouth of a cow like the courtyard of the injured</b> party, <b>or is it like the courtyard of the one responsible for the damage,</b> i.e., the owner of the cow?
The Gemara asks: <b>But if you say</b> that the mouth of the cow is <b>like the courtyard of the one responsible for the damage, how can you find</b> a case of damage classified as <b>Eating</b> for which <b>the Merciful One holds</b> the owner of the animal <b>liable?</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that one must pay for damage classified as Eating only if it occurred on the property of the injured party. If the mouth of an animal is deemed the domain of the animal’s owner, damage caused by an animal eating would always take place in the domain of the animal’s owner and he would therefore be exempt from liability in every case.
<b>Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, said:</b> It is possible to describe a case of Eating that would render the animal’s owner liable according to the one who holds that the mouth of a cow is like the domain of its owner, <b>for example,</b> if the cow <b>rubbed</b> up <b>against a wall for its pleasure</b> and broke it, or if the cow <b>soiled produce for its</b> own <b>pleasure.</b> Any action in which an animal engages for its own pleasure is classified as Eating, and if the animal causes damage thereby within the domain belonging to the injured party, its owner will be held liable since nothing has entered the mouth of the animal.
<b>Mar Zutra objects to</b> these examples of Eating: <b>But</b> in order to create liability under the <i>halakhot</i> of Eating, <b>I require</b> fulfillment of the verse: <b>“As consumes the tooth until it be all gone”</b> (I Kings 14:10), meaning that the damaged item must be completely destroyed or consumed, <b>and</b> here that is <b>not</b> the case, as the stones of the broken wall and the soiled produce have not been destroyed. To answer Mar Zutra’s question, <b>Ravina said:</b> It is possible for a cow to cause complete destruction by rubbing against a wall, e.g., a cow <b>that</b> completely <b>erases</b> any decorative <b>images</b> that were adorning the wall. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is possible for cow to cause complete destruction by soiling produce, e.g., a cow <b>that trods on</b> the produce and crushes it, thereby totally eradicating it. Consequently, the initial question about the status of the cow’s mouth remains.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>he incited a dog against</b> another person, or if <b>he incited a snake against</b> another person, he is <b>exempt</b> (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 66b). The Gemara clarifies: <b>Who</b> is <b>exempt? The one who incited</b> the dog is <b>exempt, but</b> the <b>owner of</b> the <b>dog</b> is <b>liable. And if you say</b> that the mouth of the animal is <b>like the courtyard of the one liable for the damage, let</b> the owner of the dog <b>say to</b> the injured party: <b>What does your hand want,</b> i.e., what is it doing, <b>in my dog’s mouth,</b> which is my domain?
The Gemara answers: The mishna could be understood a different way. <b>Say</b> that <b>even the one who incited</b> the dog is <b>exempt,</b> as the dog is not his property, but the dog owner is also exempt because his dog’s mouth has a legal status similar to that of the dog owner’s courtyard. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the case under discussion is one where the dog <b>extended his canine teeth and scratched the</b> victim, but the victim’s hand was not inside his mouth, and therefore this incident cannot be treated as if it took place in the domain of the owner of the dog.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution based on the continuation of the above mishna: If <b>one caused the snake to bite</b> a person by bringing the fangs of the snake to the victim’s body, and the snake killed him, <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the one who instigated the attack <b>liable</b> to receive the death penalty <b>and the Rabbis exempt</b> him.
<b>And Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says</b> in explanation of the dispute: When you analyze the matter <b>you will find that according to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, the venom of a snake is</b> deemed to be constantly <b>present between its fangs,</b> and therefore when the snake is made to strike the victim it is not actively engaged in any action. <b>Consequently,</b> the person handling the snake is liable, similar to one who <b>strikes</b> a victim <b>with a sword,</b> while the <b>snake</b> itself is <b>exempt</b> as it has not done anything. And <b>according to according to the statement of the Rabbis, the venom of a snake</b> is not present between its fangs but rather the snake must <b>secrete</b> it <b>of its own volition. Consequently,</b> the <b>snake</b> receives the penalty of <b>stoning</b> like any animal that kills a person, while the one who instigated the attack <b>and striking</b> with it is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>the mouth of the cow</b> is <b>like the courtyard of the one responsible for the damage, let</b> the owner of the snake metaphorically <b>say to</b> the injured party: <b>What is your hand doing in my snake’s mouth?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>We do not say</b> this principle <b>with regard to matters relating to</b> the <b>death</b> penalty; therefore, one who kills another is always liable, regardless of whether it occurred within the domain of the killer or within the domain of the victim.
<b>And from where do you say</b> this? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:13): With regard to <b>one who enters the courtyard of a property owner without</b> his <b>permission, and the property owner’s ox gores</b> the intruder <b>and</b> he <b>dies, the ox</b> receives the penalty of <b>stoning while</b> the <b>owner</b> is <b>exempt from</b> having to pay <b>ransom.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the reason</b> that the <b>owner</b> is <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>ransom?</b> He is exempt <b>because he can</b> metaphorically <b>say to</b> the victim: <b>What do you want in my domain,</b> i.e., why were you there without permission? Since he entered the premises without authorization, he bears responsibility for his own fate. But if that is so, the same applies to <b>his ox as well,</b> and <b>let</b> the owner of the ox <b>say to</b> the victim: <b>What do you want in my domain?</b> Rather, it must be that <b>we do not say</b> that this principle applies <b>with regard to matters relating to</b> the <b>death</b> penalty. Consequently, these cases do not prove that the mouth of the cow is like the courtyard of the victim within the scope of the <i>halakhot</i> of damages.
§ The Gemara relates: There were <b>these goats,</b> belonging to <b>the Tarbu family, that would</b> frequently <b>damage Rav Yosef’s</b> property. Rav Yosef <b>said to Abaye: Go</b> and <b>tell their owners that they must keep</b> their goats enclosed within their own property. Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Yosef in response: <b>Why should I go? If I go</b> and deliver this message, <b>they will say to me: Let</b> the <b>Master put a fence up around his property</b> so that the goats will not be able to get in there.
The Gemara questions this claim: <b>And if</b> an individual <b>did put up a fence</b> to safeguard his property from the Eating of other animals because he was required to do so, and had he not done so the owners of those animals would not be liable to pay for the damage caused by their animals, <b>how can you find</b> damage classified as <b>Eating for</b> which <b>the Merciful One</b> holds the owner of the animal <b>liable?</b> As, if it is the responsibility of the injured party to fence in his property, animals will not be able to get inside. The Gemara answers: A case in which the Torah holds the owner of the animal liable can be explained as one <b>where</b> the animal <b>burrowed under</b> the fence. <b>Alternatively,</b> it could be explained as a case <b>where</b> the separating <b>fence collapsed in</b> middle of <b>the night</b> and the owner of the fence did not have the opportunity to repair it before the animals caused damage.
The Gemara comments: <b>Rav Yosef, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabba, would announce: Those that ascend</b> to Eretz Yisrael from Babylonia, bringing with them the rulings of the Babylonian Sages, <b>as well as those that descend</b> to Babylonia from Eretz Yisrael, bringing the rulings of the sages of Eretz Yisrael with them, all agree to the following <i>halakha</i>: With regard to <b>these goats</b> that loiter <b>in the market</b> until they are slaughtered and in the meantime <b>cause damage</b> to others, <b>we warn their owner two or three times. If</b> the owner of the goats <b>heeds</b> the warning and safeguards his animals from damaging others, then <b>he heeds</b> it and no further action is necessary. <b>But if not, we say to him:</b> Go, <b>sit next to the butcher shop and take your money,</b> meaning we instruct him to slaughter his goats immediately. Since he in any event intends to slaughter them, the court can force him to do so immediately. Otherwise, he cannot be forced to slaughter them as preventive measure.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Which</b> type of ox <b>is</b> deemed <b>innocuous and which</b> is deemed <b>forewarned?</b> An ox is deemed <b>forewarned</b> in <b>any</b> case <b>where</b> witnesses <b>testified about it</b> that it gored on <b>three</b> different <b>days. And</b> it reverts back to its previous <b>innocuous</b> status <b>from when it reverses its</b> behavior and refrains from goring for <b>three</b> consecutive <b>days;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says:</b> It is deemed <b>forewarned</b> in any case <b>where</b> witnesses <b>testified</b> that <b>it</b> gored <b>three times,</b> regardless of the number of days on which this behavior occurred. <b>And</b> it reverts back to its previous <b>innocuous</b> status in <b>any</b> case <b>where children pet it</b> and play with it <b>and it does not gore</b> them.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> that an ox is deemed forewarned only if it gored on three separate days? <b>Abaye said:</b> It states in the verse: “Or if it is known that the ox was a goring ox from yesterday and the day before yesterday, and its owner has not secured it” (Exodus 21:36). This leads to the following inference: <b>“Yesterday”</b> indicates <b>one</b> day, <b>“from yesterday”</b> indicates <b>two</b> days, <b>“the day before yesterday”</b> indicates <b>three</b> days, <b>“and its owner has not secured it”;</b> here <b>we arrive at a fourth</b> incident of <b>goring,</b> for which the owner pays the full amount of damages.
<b>Rava said: “Yesterday”</b> and <b>“from yesterday”</b> are not to be expounded separately. Rather, the inference from this phrase is that “from yesterday” indicates <b>one</b> day, <b>“the day before yesterday”</b> indicates <b>two</b> days, <b>“and its owner has not secured it”</b> indicates <b>now,</b> the third incident of goring, as it is <b>liable</b> as a forewarned animal for the third goring.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> for the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who does not determine the forewarned status of an ox by the number of days on which the animal gored but simply by the number of times? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir said:</b>

Daf 24a

When the ox <b>performs its gorings at intervals,</b> its owner is <b>liable;</b> if it <b>performs its gorings successively,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> that its owner is liable? <b>They said to</b> Rabbi Meir: The <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a woman who experiences a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period [<i>zava</i>] will prove</b> that your <i>a fortiori</i> inference is invalid: If <b>her sightings occur at intervals,</b> i.e., if she sees a flow of uterine blood on three consecutive days, she becomes <b>ritually impure;</b> while if <b>her sightings were consecutive,</b> for example if all three occurred on the same day, she remains <b>pure.</b>
Rabbi Meir <b>said to them:</b> The case of the <i>zava</i> does not disprove my opinion, because the verse <b>states</b> in reference to the parallel <i>halakha</i> of a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>]: <b>“And this shall be his ritual impurity when he has a discharge”</b> (Leviticus 15:3). The word “this” emphasizes that in this matter the <i>halakha</i> requires following the instructions of the verse precisely as they were recorded, and in this case <b>the verse associates</b> the impurity of <b>the <i>zav</i> with</b> the number of <b>sightings</b> of discharges the man observed, <b>and</b> it associates <b>the</b> impurity of the <b><i>zava</i> with</b> the number of <b>days</b> during which she experienced sightings of blood, as it says: “Many days” (Leviticus 15:25). By contrast, with regard to the goring ox, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference remains in place.
The Gemara asks about this interpretation: <b>From where</b> is it determined <b>that this</b> additional phrase: <b>“And this,”</b> serves <b>to exclude a <i>zava</i> from</b> having her status determined by individual <b>sightings</b> of blood, associating it instead with the number of days on which she experienced bleeding? <b>Say</b> instead that it serves <b>to exclude</b> the <b><i>zav</i> from</b> having his status determined by sightings on separate <b>days,</b> indicating that he will be rendered a <i>zav</i> only if he experienced three discharges on a single day and not on separate days. The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> elsewhere: <b>“And one who has a discharge, whether it be a man or a woman”</b> (Leviticus 15:33). The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the ritual impurity of <b>a male to</b> that of <b>a female</b> to teach that <b>just as</b> the <b>female’s</b> ritual impurity is caused by sightings on multiple <b>days, so too</b> the ritual impurity of <b>a male</b> can be caused by sightings on multiple <b>days.</b>
The Gemara asks: The derivation from the verse could just as easily lead to the opposite conclusion. <b>But let</b> him <b>compare</b> the <b>female to</b> the <b>male; just as a male</b> becomes ritually impure <b>based on</b> the number of <b>sightings,</b> even if they all occur on the same day, <b>so too</b> should <b>a female</b> become ritually impure <b>based on</b> the number of <b>sightings,</b> even on the same day. The Gemara answers: <b>But the Merciful One excluded</b> this possibility by making use of the term <b>“and this.”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see</b> to make you exclude associating the ritual impurity of women with the number of sightings, rather than excluding associating the ritual impu-rity of men with the number of days? The Gemara answers: <b>It stands to reason</b> that this is so, as the context of the verse <b>deals with sightings,</b> and therefore an additional phrase serves to <b>exclude sightings,</b> but can you say that in a context where it <b>deals with sightings it excludes days?</b> The exclusionary term “and this” appears in the section discussing the <i>halakhot</i> of the <i>zav</i>, in the context of which it mentions sightings and not days, and therefore when it excludes something from these <i>halakhot</i> and limits them to specific cases, it will exclude it from being associated with sightings.
The Gemara returns to the subject of classifying an ox as innocuous or forewarned: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Which</b> type of ox <b>is</b> deemed <b>forewarned? Any</b> animal <b>about which</b> witnesses <b>testified</b> that it gored on <b>three days</b> is forewarned. <b>And</b> it reverts to its former <b>innocuous</b> status <b>if children pet it and</b> nevertheless <b>it does not gore;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei. Rabbi Shimon says: A forewarned</b> ox is <b>any</b> ox <b>about which</b> witnesses <b>testified</b> that it gored <b>three times, and</b> the Sages <b>spoke</b> about <b>three days only with regard to reversals,</b> meaning that in order for an ox to revert to innocuous status, the ox must refrain from goring on three separate days. Each of these additional views on this subject combine aspects of both of the opinions mentioned in the mishna, those of Rabbi Yehuda and those of Rabbi Meir.
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda concerning</b> the criteria for deeming an animal <b>forewarned, as Rabbi Yosei concedes to his</b> opinion on this issue, <b>and</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir concerning</b> the criteria for reverting the status of an animal to <b>innocuous, as Rabbi Yosei concedes to his</b> opinion on that issue.
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: And let the Master say</b> the reverse, that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir concerning</b> the criteria for deeming an animal <b>forewarned, as Rabbi Shimon concedes to his</b> opinion on this issue <b>and</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda concerning</b> the criteria for reverting the status of an ox to <b>innocuous, as Rabbi Shimon concedes to his</b> opinion on that issue. Rav Naḥman <b>replied to</b> Rava: <b>I hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as Rabbi Yosei’s analysis [<i>nimmuko</i>] is with him,</b> i.e., it is sound.
<b>A dilemma was raised</b> before the Sages: The <b>three days that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in the context of Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion with regard to the testimony needed to assign the status of forewarned to an ox, are they needed in order <b>to render the ox forewarned, or</b> are they needed in order <b>to forewarn the man</b> who owns the ox, to inform him that he needs to take precautions to keep it from causing further harm?
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> between the two possibilities? The Gemara answers: The practical difference is in a case <b>where three groups of witnesses came</b> to the court <b>on one day,</b> each testifying about a separate instance of goring caused by the ox on three separate days. <b>If you say</b> that their testimony serves to <b>render the ox forewarned</b> by determining that it gored on three separate days, then in this case the animal <b>has been classified</b> as <b>forewarned</b> on the basis of their testimony. <b>But if you say</b> that their testimony serves to <b>forewarn the man,</b> the ox <b>has not been classified</b> as <b>forewarned</b> on the basis of this testimony since the owner heard all of the testimony on a single day. This enables <b>him to say:</b> It is only <b>now</b> that they <b>testified against me;</b> and therefore his ox will not be deemed forewarned until he has been issued warnings over the course of three separate days. <b>What,</b> then, is the solution to the dilemma raised above?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:3): <b>An ox does not become forewarned until</b> witnesses <b>testify against it in the presence of</b> its <b>owner and in the presence of a court.</b> If <b>they testified against it in the presence of a court but not in the presence of</b> its <b>owner,</b> or <b>in the presence of</b> its <b>owner but not in the presence of a court, it does not become forewarned until they testify against it in the presence of a court and in the presence of</b> its <b>owner.</b>
Furthermore, if <b>two</b> witnesses <b>testified against</b> the ox <b>concerning</b> its <b>first</b> incident of goring, <b>and two</b> other witnesses testified against it <b>concerning</b> the <b>second</b> incident, <b>and two</b> other witnesses testified against it <b>concerning</b> the <b>third</b> incident, <b>there are three</b> separate <b>testimonies here, but</b> they <b>are</b> considered as <b>one with regard to rendering</b> their statements as <b>conspiring testimony.</b>
Therefore, if <b>the first set</b> of witnesses <b>is determined to be conspiring</b> witnesses, <b>there are two testimonies</b> remaining <b>here</b> that claim that the ox gored, and the owner must pay for half the cost of the damage in each case. <b>But</b> the owner of the ox is <b>exempt</b> from having to pay the full cost of the damage, <b>and</b> the conspiring witnesses are <b>exempt</b> from paying the owner what he would have had to pay were their testimony accepted and his ox deemed forewarned, as they testified only concerning the first incident of goring, and the ox would not have been deemed forewarned on the basis of this testimony alone. And similarly, if <b>the second set</b> of witnesses was also <b>determined to be conspiring</b> witnesses, <b>there is one testimony</b> remaining <b>here</b> that claims that the ox gored, the third. At this point too, the owner of the ox is <b>exempt</b> from having to pay the full cost of the damage <b>and</b> the conspiring witnesses are <b>exempt</b> from having to pay the owner the full cost of the damage.
If <b>the third group</b> of witnesses was also <b>determined to be conspiring witnesses, all</b> the witnesses become <b>liable.</b> The third group is liable to pay the owner of the animal the payment for half the cost of the damage they tried to make him pay for the third incident of goring, and all three groups must share in the payment of the other half of the damage for the final incident that they tried to charge him for by classifying his ox as forewarned. <b>And concerning this it is stated: “And you shall do unto him as he had conspired to do</b> unto his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19).
The Gemara clarifies: <b>If you say</b> that the purpose of the testimony is <b>to render the ox forewarned,</b> the <i>halakha</i> presented in this <i>baraita</i> <b>works out well,</b> as according to this opinion it can be said that all of the witnesses came on the same day at the behest of the alleged victim of the third incident, and therefore they were all certainly aware of each other’s testimony. Consequently, the first set of witnesses shares in the responsibility for the testimony of the last group, as they are all co-witnesses in the effort to have the ox rendered forewarned.

Daf 24b

<b>But if you say</b> that the witnesses came <b>to forewarn the man,</b> to caution him to safeguard his animal from causing harm, then they must have come on three separate days. And if so, <b>let these first</b> witnesses <b>say: Did we know that after three days these</b> other witnesses <b>were going to come to testify about</b> the animal? Therefore, it must be that the case in the <i>baraita</i> is one where the three groups of witnesses all came on the same day, and if that is so, the purpose of the testimony must be to render the ox forewarned.
<b>Rav Ashi said: I recited</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Kahana and he replied to me</b> in response to this proof: <b>And does it work out well</b> to say that they are coming <b>to render the ox forewarned?</b> Even in a case where all of the witnesses arrive in court on the same day, <b>let these last</b> witnesses <b>say: From where were we to know that all</b> those <b>standing in court came to testify about the ox? We came to make this person liable</b> to pay for <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> his animal allegedly caused, but we are not responsible for the attempt to make him pay the full cost of the damage for the third incident.
The Gemara answers: It must be that the case concerns a situation <b>where</b> the different groups of witnesses <b>were</b> observed <b>signaling</b> to each other, and therefore it is clear that they were aware of each other’s testimony and that they came to the court for this purpose. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The case is one <b>where they</b> all <b>came in succession,</b> one following the other, and therefore it is clear that the latter witnesses are aware of the former.
<b>Ravina said:</b> In this case the witnesses said that they were <b>acquainted with the owner of the</b> goring <b>ox but</b> they were <b>not familiar with the ox</b> itself. This indicates that they were coming to court to render the ox forewarned, as the witnesses are not able to identify the goring ox and they would not be able to hold its owner liable to pay for half the cost of the damage, as this payment is paid only from the proceeds of the sale of the animal. Therefore, the only purpose of their testimony would be to hold the owner liable to pay the full cost of the damage for the third incident, as this payment is made from the owner’s superior-quality land.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if they were not familiar with the ox, <b>how could they render it forewarned?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They said</b> to the animal’s owner: <b>You have a goring ox among your cattle, and</b> therefore <b>you need to safeguard all of the cattle.</b>
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In the case of <b>one who incites another’s dog against another,</b> i.e., a third person, and he is injured, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>The one who incited</b> the animal against him is <b>certainly exempt,</b> since he did not cause the damage directly and neither did his property; but <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>owner of the dog?</b> The Gemara explains the different sides of the question: <b>Do we say</b> that the owner of the dog <b>can say to</b> the injured party: <b>What did I do to</b> the dog? <b>Or perhaps we say to him: Since you were aware that if others incite your dog it is prone to</b> being <b>affected</b> by the <b>incitement</b> and attacking, <b>you ought not to have kept it</b> in your possession. Since you did, you are liable for the damage and the injuries it causes.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> an ox reverts to its former <b>innocuous</b> status <b>if children pet it and</b> nevertheless <b>it does not gore.</b> It can be inferred from this that <b>if it gores</b> when the children pet it, the owner would be <b>liable</b> to pay for the damage. An ox that gores because children pet it can be likened to one that gores because it was incited to do so, and nevertheless the mishna holds the owner liable. <b>Abaye said: Is it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that if <b>it gored</b> the owner is <b>liable? Perhaps</b> that is not what the <i>baraita</i> means. It merely means that <b>if it gored it</b> does <b>not</b> revert to <b>innocuous</b> status; but the owner is <b>not liable for</b> any of the damage caused by <b>that goring</b> because the children incited the animal to do so, and therefore nothing can be conclusively demonstrated from the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara attempts to prove this point from another source: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 76b): If one <b>incited a dog against another</b> person, or <b>incited a snake against another</b> person, he is <b>exempt. What, is it not that the one who incited</b> the dog against him is <b>exempt, but</b> the <b>owner of the dog</b> is <b>liable?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, say</b> that <b>even the one who incited</b> the animal against him is <b>exempt,</b> as well as the owner.
<b>Rava said:</b> Even <b>if you say</b> that one who <b>incites the dog of another against</b> yet <b>another</b> person is <b>liable,</b> nevertheless if <b>he incited the dog against himself,</b> i.e., the dog bit the one who was inciting it to attack, he is <b>exempt. What is the reason</b> for this? Due to the principle that with regard to <b>anyone who deviates</b> from normative behavior in his actions, <b>if another came along</b> afterward <b>and deviates</b> from the norm <b>with regard to</b> the action the first has done and thereby causes damage to him, the one who causes the damage is <b>exempt</b> from liability. Since this individual deviated from the normative behavior and incited the dog against himself, the owner of the dog is not responsible for any damage the dog causes to him as a result, although generally speaking any time a dog bites it is in and of itself a deviation from its typical behavior and something for which its owner would normally be held liable.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: It was stated in the name of Reish Lakish in accordance with your</b> opinion, that if anyone deviates from normative behavior in his actions, if another came along afterward and deviates from the norm with regard to the action the first has done and thereby causes damage to him, the one who causes the damage is exempt from liability. <b>As Reish Lakish says:</b> If there were <b>two cows in the public domain, one prone</b> in the street <b>and</b> the other <b>one walking,</b> if the <b>walking</b> cow <b>kicked</b> the <b>prone</b> cow, its owner is <b>exempt</b> from liability. But if the <b>prone</b> cow kicked the <b>walking</b> cow, its owner is <b>liable.</b> The rationale for this is that since it is typical behavior for cows to walk in the public domain and the prone cow deviated from this behavior, even if the walking cow also acted atypically and kicked the prone cow, the owner is exempt from liability.
Rava <b>said</b> back <b>to</b> Rav Pappa: That is not in accordance with my opinion, as <b>I would have held</b> the owner of the walking cow <b>liable in that</b> case, <b>because</b> in my opinion <b>we say to him</b> on behalf of the prone cow: It is true <b>that you have the right to tread on me</b> in the public domain but <b>you do not have the right to kick me,</b> and therefore Rava’s and Reish Lakish’s opinions are not exactly the same.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>And what is</b> the case of the <b>ox that causes damage</b> while <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, mentioned in an earlier mishna (15b) that listed animals that are forewarned? If the animal <b>gored, pushed, bit, squatted</b> upon, or <b>kicked</b> another animal <b>in the public domain,</b> the owner is liable to <b>pay half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> if the ox was innocuous, but if it acted while <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, <b>Rabbi Tarfon says:</b> He must pay the <b>full</b> cost of <b>the damage, and the Rabbis say:</b> He must pay <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> as in any other case classified as Goring.
<b>Rabbi Tarfon said to the</b> Rabbis: <b>If in a place where</b> the Torah <b>was lenient with regard to</b> damage classified as <b>Eating and with regard to Trampling,</b> specifically <b>in the public domain, as</b> the owner <b>is exempt</b> from liability, nevertheless the Torah was <b>strict with regard to these</b> forms of damage if they occurred <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, requiring him <b>to pay</b> the <b>full</b> cost of <b>the damage,</b> then in <b>a place where</b> the Torah <b>was strict with regard to</b> cases of damage classified as <b>Goring,</b> specifically <b>in the public domain,</b> requiring the owner liable <b>to pay for half</b> the cost of <b>the damage, is it not right that we</b> should <b>be strict with regard to this</b> form of damage if it occurs <b>on the property of the injured</b> party to likewise require the owner of the animal <b>to pay</b> the <b>full</b> cost of <b>the damage?</b>
The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> Although there is an <i>a fortiori</i> inference being applied here, still <b>it is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source,</b> meaning that the <i>halakha</i> cannot be stricter with the inference than it is with the case that serves as the source of the inference. Therefore, <b>just as</b> one is liable to pay <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> classified as Goring <b>in the public domain, so too,</b> for damage classified as Goring <b>on the property of the injured</b> party he is liable to pay only <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
Rabbi Tarfon <b>said to them:</b> If that is your opinion, then <b>I as well</b>

Daf 25a

<b>will not derive an inference</b> with regard to <b>Goring from</b> a different case of <b>Goring. I will</b> instead <b>derive an inference</b> with regard to <b>Goring from Trampling: And if in a place where</b> the Torah <b>was lenient with regard to</b> damage classified as <b>Eating and Trampling,</b> specifically <b>in the public domain,</b> as the owner is exempt from liability, nevertheless the Torah was <b>strict with regard to</b> damage classified as <b>Goring,</b> requiring him to pay half the cost of the damage, then in <b>a place where</b> the Torah <b>was strict with regard to</b> damage classified as <b>Eating and Trampling,</b> specifically <b>on the property of the injured</b> party as the animal’s owner is obligated to pay the full cost of the damage, <b>is it not right that we</b> should <b>be</b> equally <b>strict with regard to</b> damage classified as <b>Goring</b> and require payment of the full cost of the damage in this case as well?
The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> Here as well, <b>it is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source,</b> and therefore, <b>just as</b> one is liable to pay <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> classified as Goring <b>in the public domain, so too,</b> for damage classified as Goring <b>on the property of the injured</b> party he will be liable to pay only <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> as ultimately your inference still depends on the fact that for Goring in the public domain one pays half the cost of the damage.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>And</b> is it true that <b>Rabbi Tarfon does not accept</b> the principle of: <b>It is sufficient</b> for the conclusion that emerges from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference to be like its source? <b>But</b> that cannot be, as the principle that begins with: <b>It is sufficient, is</b> an aspect <b>of Torah law, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Sages said that one of the ways in which the Torah may be interpreted is <b>by an <i>a fortiori</i> inference. How</b> is this <b>so?</b> It is written (Numbers 12:14): <b>“And the Lord said to Moses: If her father had but spit in her face, should she not hide in shame seven days?</b> Let her be shut up seven days outside the camp, and after that she shall be brought in again,” and therefore, using <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference it can be derived <b>that</b> if <b>the Divine Presence</b> reprimanded her, she should hide in shame for <b>fourteen days.</b> Why was Miriam banished for only seven days? <b>Rather,</b> it is because <b>it is sufficient</b> for the conclusion <b>that emerged from the</b> <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like the source</b> of the inference. Consequently, this principle is mandated by the Torah itself.
The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> Rabbi Tarfon <b>does not accept</b> the principle: <b>It is sufficient,</b> it is <b>where</b> this principle completely <b>refutes</b> the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, leaving no <i>halakha</i> derived from it. But <b>where it does not</b> completely <b>refute</b> the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, Rabbi Tarfon <b>accepts</b> the principle: <b>It is sufficient.</b> Consequently, <b>there,</b> with regard to Miriam, the <b>seven</b> days during which she deserved to be banished from the camp due to the rebuke <b>of the Divine Presence were not written,</b> so <b>the <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>came</b> and <b>brought</b> those days plus additional days, adding up to a total of <b>fourteen,</b> and then the principle: <b>It is sufficient, came</b> and <b>removed seven</b> days <b>and left seven</b> days intact. Consequently, the <i>a fortiori</i> inference was effective with regard to the seven days during which she was banished from the camp.
<b>But here,</b> payment for <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage is written</b> explicitly in the Torah with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of Goring in the public domain, <b>and the <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>comes and brings an additional</b> payment for <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage, forming</b> a payment of <b>the full</b> cost of the <b>damage. If you interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> employing the principle: <b>It is sufficient,</b> to reduce the payment to half the cost of the damage, this completely <b>refutes</b> the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, as no <i>halakha</i> would be derived from the inference; the initial payment for half the cost of the damage was written explicitly in the Torah. Consequently, in this case, Rabbi Tarfon does not employ the principle: It is sufficient.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> understand this matter? How do they respond to Rabbi Tarfon’s reasoning? The Gemara answers: In their opinion, the <b>seven</b> days during which Miriam had to be banished due to the reprimand she received <b>from the Divine Presence</b> are in fact <b>written</b> in the Torah: <b>“Let her be shut up seven days.”</b> This indicates that the <i>a fortiori</i> inference is not required to teach the <i>halakha</i> of the seven days she was banished, as it would have added only the extra seven days. This means that according to the Rabbis, there is a source in the Torah that the principle: It is sufficient, is employed even when it refutes the <i>a fortiori</i> inference completely.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what would <b>Rabbi Tarfon</b> say about that reasoning? The Gemara answers: He would say that <b>this</b> verse: <b>“Let her be shut up</b> seven days,” is necessary to teach us the basic fact <b>that we interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according to the principle: <b>It is sufficient</b> for the conclusion that emerges from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference to be like its source.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what would <b>the Rabbis</b> say in response? The Gemara answers: They would point out that <b>a different verse is written</b> about Miriam: <b>“And Miriam was shut up</b> outside the camp seven days” (Numbers 12:15). The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Tarfon</b> respond to that? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse teaches <b>that we interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> according to the principle: <b>It is sufficient, even generally,</b> and not only in this specific case. <b>And</b> this point is necessary so that <b>you do not say: Here</b> the principle: It is sufficient, is employed <b>due to respect for Moses, but generally</b> that is <b>not</b> done. This verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> Is the fundamental principle: It is sufficient for the conclusion that emerges from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference to be like its source, actually accepted by all authorities? <b>But</b> there is <b>this <i>tanna</i>, who does not interpret</b> the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with the principle: <b>It is sufficient, even though</b> it is a case where the principle <b>does not refute</b> the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference completely. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that the <b>semen of a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>zav</i>]</b> imparts ritual impurity by someone carrying it as well as by coming into contact with it, just as the actual gonorrhea-like discharge does? <b>It is a logical derivation</b> from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>Just as</b> spittle, which is <b>ritually pure</b> when coming <b>from</b> a person who is <b>ritually pure,</b> is <b>impure</b> when coming <b>from</b> someone like a <i>zav</i> who is <b>impure, is it not logical that</b> semen, which is <b>impure</b> when coming <b>from</b> someone who is <b>pure, should be impure</b> when coming <b>from</b> someone who is <b>impure?</b>
<b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>brings</b> this derivation and applies it <b>whether</b> discussing ritual impurity imparted <b>by contact</b> or <b>whether</b> discussing impurity imparted <b>by carrying. And why</b> is this the case? <b>Let us say: The <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>is effective in</b> teaching that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity <b>by contact</b> alone, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the semen of a pure man, and the principle: <b>It is sufficient, is effective</b> by limiting the scope of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>to exclude</b> the semen of a <i>zav</i> from imparting ritual impurity <b>by carrying.</b> Since the <i>tanna</i> does not formulate his derivation in this manner, it appears that he rejects the principle: It is sufficient, in all situations.
<b>And if you would say</b> that the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>was not necessary</b> to teach that the seminal emission of the <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity <b>by contact, as it is</b> certainly <b>no less</b> impure <b>than</b> if it had come from <b>a man</b> who was <b>pure,</b> so the inference was necessary only to teach that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity by carrying, this is not correct. In fact, it <b>was necessary</b> to teach this point, as it may <b>enter your mind to say</b> that since <b>it is written</b> in the verse: “If there be among you any man that is not clean because of something that <b>happens to him by night”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:11), this means that a seminal emission is ritually impure if it came from <b>someone who</b> had something <b>happen to him,</b> and this <b>causes him</b> to experience the emission, but the verse is <b>excluding this</b> <i>zav</i>, who did <b>not</b> have something <b>happen to him</b> to <b>cause him</b> to experience the emission, but <b>rather another matter,</b> i.e., his gonorrhea-like condition, <b>caused him</b> to experience the emission. Consequently, it <b>teaches us</b> that this is incorrect.
Abaye responded: In the verse “something that happens to him by night,” <b>is it</b> also <b>written: But not another matter?</b> This limiting clause is not written in the verse, and therefore the <i>halakha</i> that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity by contact can be understood from the explicit verse in the Torah, and there is no need to derive it from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference. Therefore, the only function of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference is to teach the halakha that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts impurity by carrying. Applying the principle: It is sufficient, would refute the <i>a fortiori</i> inference completely, so there is no proof that the <i>tanna</i> would apply the principle in all circumstances.
Once the Gemara raised the issue, it clarifies: <b>And who is the <i>tanna</i></b> about whom <b>you heard that he said: Semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity by carrying?</b> It was <b>not Rabbi Eliezer and not Rabbi Yehoshua. As we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity by contact but</b> it <b>does not impart ritual impurity by carrying;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. And Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> It <b>also imparts ritual impurity by carrying, as it is impossible</b> for semen to emerge <b>without small drops of gonorrhea-like discharge [<i>ziva</i>]</b> accompanying it.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says there</b> that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity by carrying <b>only because it is impossible</b> for semen to emerge <b>without small drops of <i>ziva</i></b> accompanying it. This indicates that <b>if not for this</b> reason, the semen would <b>not</b> impart ritual impurity by carrying, according to the opinions of both Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Eliezer. The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>this <i>tanna</i> is</b> the one who holds the opinion that the semen of a <i>zav</i> imparts ritual impurity by carrying, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna listing the sources of ritual impurity (<i>Kelim</i> 1:3): <b>Of a greater degree than</b> the ritual impurities listed previously in the mishna, i.e., the impurity of a creeping animal, semen, and one who contracted ritual impurity from a corpse,

Daf 25b

are the <b><i>ziva</i> of a <i>zav</i>, and his spittle, and his semen, and his urine, and the blood of a menstruating woman,</b> all of which <b>impart impurity both by touching and by carrying.</b>
The Gemara questions this assertion: <b>But perhaps</b> here too the reason for the severity of ritual impurity of the semen is <b>indeed because it is impossible</b> for it to emerge <b>without small drops of <i>ziva</i></b> accompanying it, but it is not due to the impurity of the semen itself. The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>If</b> that would be <b>so, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teach it</b> in the list of bodily fluids <b>along with,</b> meaning list it immediately following, <b>his <i>ziva</i>. What is different</b> about semen <b>that he teaches it along with: His spittle? Rather,</b> it is <b>because its</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>comes from,</b> i.e., it is derived from, that of <b>his spittle,</b> and therefore the semen itself imparts impurity by carrying, even if there would not be small drops of <i>ziva</i> accompanying it.
The Gemara returns to the primary discussion concerning the principle: It is sufficient for the conclusion that emerges from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference to be like its source. <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: But</b> there is <b>this <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>does not apply</b> the principle: <b>It is sufficient,</b> at all, <b>even though</b> such application would <b>not refute</b> the entire <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that a thick <b>mat</b> can contract ritual impurity <b>from a corpse? It is a logical derivation</b> based on an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>And just as small</b> clay <b>vessels,</b> into which even a finger cannot be inserted because of their narrow opening and <b>which</b> remain <b>ritually pure</b> despite contact <b>with a <i>zav</i>,</b> nevertheless <b>become impure</b> if present under one roof <b>with a corpse,</b> then <b>is it not right that a mat, which can become impure</b> due to contact <b>with a <i>zav</i>, will</b> similarly <b>become impure</b> if present under one roof <b>with a corpse?</b>
<b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>cites this</b> <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>both</b> to derive the <i>halakha</i> that the mat becomes ritually impure <b>with impurity</b> that lasts until <b>nightfall,</b> as it would if it were to come into contact with a <i>zav</i>, <b>and</b> to derive that the mat becomes ritually impure <b>with impurity</b> that lasts for <b>seven</b> days, as would any vessel that contracted ritual impurity from a corpse. <b>And why</b> does he do so? <b>Say</b> instead that the <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>is effective</b> in deriving the <i>halakha</i> that the mat can contract ritual impurity from a corpse, but only <b>with regard to</b> rendering it <b>impure until nightfall,</b> and also say that the principle: <b>It is sufficient, is effective</b> by limiting the scope of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>to exclude</b> the possibility that the mat would be rendered <b>impure for seven</b> days.
Ravina <b>said to</b> Rav Aḥa: This question <b>was already raised</b> by <b>Rav Naḥman bar Zekharya to Abaye, and Abaye said to him</b> in response: This <b><i>tanna</i></b> does not derive the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the mat through an <i>a fortiori</i> inference from the case of a <i>zav</i>. Rather, he <b>derives it from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a mat</b> that came into contact <b>with</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, and this is</b> what <b>he is saying:</b> The first derivation is as follows: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>a mat</b> is susceptible to impurity imparted <b>by</b> the carcass of <b>a creeping animal? And it is a logical derivation</b> based on an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>And just as small vessels, which</b> remain <b>pure</b> despite contact <b>with a <i>zav</i>,</b> nevertheless become <b>impure from</b> contact with the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, is it not right that a mat, which</b> becomes <b>impure from the impurity of a <i>zav</i>, will</b> likewise become <b>impure from</b> contact with the carcass of <b>a creeping animal?</b>
The second derivation is as follows: <b>But from where</b> is it derived that <b>a mat</b> contracts impurity <b>from a corpse?</b> It is derived through a verbal analogy. <b>With regard to</b> impurity imparted by the carcass of <b>a creeping animal, it is stated:</b> “Or <b>a garment or leather”</b> (Leviticus 11:32), <b>and with regard to</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse it is stated: “A garment, or</b> anything made of <b>leather”</b> (Numbers 31:20). <b>Just as</b> with regard to the terms <b>“garment” and “leather” stated with regard to a creeping animal, a mat</b> becomes <b>impure from it, so too</b> with regard to the terms <b>“garment” and “leather” stated with regard to a corpse, a mat</b> becomes <b>impure from it.</b>
The Gemara notes: It must be that the words “garment” and “leather” are <b>free,</b> i.e., those terms must be extraneous in their contexts, and the Torah included them for the express purpose of establishing the verbal analogy, as a verbal analogy that is based on otherwise extraneous terms cannot be logically refuted. <b>Because if</b> these terms are <b>not free,</b> the verbal analogy <b>can be refuted: What</b> is unique <b>about a creeping animal?</b> It is unique in <b>that</b> it <b>renders</b> items <b>impure</b> even <b>by means of</b> contact with <b>a lentil-bulk</b> of a creeping animal. <b>Shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the case <b>with regard to a corpse,</b> whose <i>halakhot</i> are less strict <b>in that</b> it <b>does not render</b> items <b>impure by means of</b> contact with <b>a lentil-bulk</b> of a corpse but <b>rather by means of</b> contact with <b>an olive-bulk?</b> Unless the terms are free, the analogy can be refuted.
The Gemara affirms: <b>Indeed,</b> the terms <b>are free.</b> The Gemara proves that the terms “garment” and “leather” are extraneous in their context. <b>Now, since</b> ritual impurity imparted by contact with <b>a creeping animal is juxtaposed to</b> ritual impurity imparted by contact with <b>semen, as it is written:</b> “And one who comes into contact with anyone impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, <b>or a man from whom</b> semen <b>is emitted”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>and juxtaposed to that</b> verse is the verse: <b>“Or a man who touches any creeping animal</b> which makes him impure, or a person who may make him impure with any impurity that he has” (Leviticus 22:5); <b>and it is written with regard to</b> the impurity of <b>semen: “And every garment and all leather that has semen on it</b> shall be washed with water and will be impure until evening” (Leviticus 15:17), since the verses appear next to each other, the <i>halakhot</i> of each can be derived from the other.
Consequently, <b>why do I</b> need the words <b>“garment” and “leather” that the Merciful One wrote with regard to a creeping animal?</b> The relevant <i>halakha</i> could be derived from the <i>halakhot</i> of seminal impurity. Consequently, <b>learn from it</b> that “garment” and “leather” were mentioned <b>to render them free,</b> i.e., extraneous, but the Torah included them for the express purpose of establishing the verbal analogy.
The Gemara comments: <b>And still,</b> the terms “garment” and “leather” <b>are free</b> only <b>from one side</b> of the verbal analogy, because although the terms “garment” and “leather,” stated with regard to ritual impurity imparted by a creeping animal, are extraneous in their context, as the relevant <i>halakha</i> could have been derived in another manner, those terms stated with regard to impurity imparted by a corpse are not extraneous in their context. <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that with regard to a verbal analogy that is <b>free from</b> only <b>one side, one can derive from it and</b> one <b>cannot refute</b> it logically; <b>it is well. But according to the one who says</b> that <b>one can derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> a verbal analogy of this kind <b>and</b> one <b>can</b> also <b>refute</b> it logically, <b>what can be said?</b> It has already been established that the carcass of a creeping animal is stricter in some senses than a corpse.
The Gemara answers: The terms “garment” and “leather,” as stated <b>with regard to</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse, are also free. Since</b> the impurity of <b>a corpse is juxtaposed with</b> that of <b>semen, as it is written: “And one who comes into contact with anyone impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, or a man from whom</b> semen <b>is emitted”</b> (Leviticus 22:4), <b>and it is written with regard to semen: “And every garment and all leather that has semen on it”</b> (Leviticus 15:17), <b>why do I</b> need the terms <b>“garment” and “leather” that the Merciful One wrote with regard to</b> impurity imparted by <b>a corpse? Learn from it</b> that they are mentioned in order <b>to render them free, and</b> therefore <b>it is free from both sides.</b>
The Gemara questions this from a different angle: <b>This works out well according to the one who says: Infer</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from it and interpret it according to its</b> new <b>place.</b> This would mean that the <i>halakha</i> that a mat becomes impure from a corpse is derived from the <i>halakha</i> that a mat becomes impure from semen, but the details of that impurity, i.e., the length of the time it is impure, are interpreted according to the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity imparted by a corpse, for seven days. <b>But according to the one who says: Infer</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from it and</b> infer the details of the <i>halakha</i> <b>from it</b> as well, which would mean that the details of the impurity would also be interpreted according to the <i>halakhot</i> of impurity imparted by semen, <b>what can be said?</b> According to the latter opinion, it should be concluded that just as the impurity imparted to a mat by the carcass of a creeping animal lasts only until nightfall, so too, a mat rendered impure by a corpse remains impure only until nightfall.
In response to this, <b>Rava said:</b> This opinion does not lead to that conclusion, as there is a Torah edict indicating otherwise. <b>The verse states</b> (Numbers 31:24): <b>“And you shall wash your garments on the seventh day.”</b> This teaches that <b>any ritually impure</b> items <b>that you render impure</b> due to contact <b>with a corpse must</b> remain impure for a period of <b>no less than seven</b> days. Therefore, since it has been inferred that the mat is susceptible to the impurity imparted by a corpse, it automatically falls into the same category of other items similarly rendered impure by a corpse and must remain impure for a period of at least seven days.
§ Up to this point, the Gemara discussed how to properly apply the principle: It is sufficient for the conclusion that emerges from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference to be like its source. It now returns to discussing the main subject of the mishna, which is the various views concerning Goring, the primary category of damage. The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> one be held <b>liable</b> for <b>Eating and Trampling</b> if these take place <b>in the public domain.</b> This can be inferred <b>via</b> an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, as follows: <b>And if</b> with regard to damage classified as <b>Goring, for which,</b> if it took place <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, according to the Rabbis one is liable to <b>pay only half</b> the cost of <b>the damage, yet</b> the owner of the animal is nevertheless <b>liable</b> for damage caused <b>in the public domain,</b> then with regard to damage classified as <b>Eating and Trampling,</b> whose <i>halakhot</i> are more strict, <b>as</b> one <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage</b> caused <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, <b>is it not right that</b> one should be <b>liable</b> for damage caused <b>in the public domain?</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to Eating or Trampling (Exodus 22:4): <b>“And it consumed in the field of another,”</b> meaning that one’s liability for this form of damage is limited to damage caused on the property of the injured party, but <b>not</b> for damage caused <b>in the public domain.</b>

Daf 26a

The Gemara asks: <b>Are we saying</b> that based on the <i>a fortiori</i> inference one should have to pay the <b>full</b> cost of the damage caused in the public domain for Eating and Trampling? That would be false, as the verse indicating one’s liability to pay the full cost of the damage limits the application to damage caused in “the field of another.” <b>We are saying</b> only that he should be liable for <b>half</b> the cost of the damage there, just as with regard to Goring.
The Gemara rejects this as well: This is also incorrect, as <b>the verse states</b> with regard to the payment of half the damages: <b>“And divide its monetary value”</b> (Exodus 21:35). The use of the expression “its monetary value,” and not “the monetary value,” emphasizes that it is specifically <b>the price of this</b> ox that caused damage classified as Goring whose money will be divided, i.e., the owner of the ox will be obligated to pay half the cost of the damage, <b>but not the price of another,</b> i.e., not in other cases of damage caused by one’s ox.
The Gemara suggests a derivation from a different inference: <b>And let</b> one be held <b>liable</b> to pay <b>only half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> caused by <b>Eating and Trampling</b> even if the incident took place <b>on the property of the injured</b> party. This can be inferred <b>via</b> an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference drawn <b>from Goring,</b> as follows: <b>And if</b> for damage classified as <b>Goring,</b> which is governed by a stricter <i>halakha</i>, as one is held <b>liable</b> for damage classified as Goring even if it occurs <b>in the public domain,</b> yet one nevertheless <b>pays only half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> caused <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, then with regard to damage classified as <b>Eating and Trampling,</b> which are governed by more lenient <i>halakhot</i>, as one is completely <b>exempt</b> from liability for damage caused <b>in the public domain, is it not right that</b> he should have to <b>pay</b> only <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> caused <b>on the property of the injured</b> party?
The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to Eating and Trampling: “The best of his field and the best of his vineyard <b>he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4). The intent of the verse is to emphasize that the owner of the ox pays <b>a proper,</b> meaning complete, amount of <b>payment,</b> and not half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara suggests a derivation from a different inference: <b>And let</b> one <b>not</b> be held <b>liable</b> at all with regard to damage classified as <b>Goring in the public domain.</b> This can be inferred <b>via</b> an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, as follows: <b>And if</b> for damage classified as <b>Eating and Trampling, for which</b> one is liable to pay <b>the full</b> cost of <b>the damage</b> for incidents that took place <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, one is completely <b>exempt</b> for damage caused <b>in the public domain,</b> then with regard to damage classified as <b>Goring,</b> which is governed by a more lenient <i>halakha</i>, as one is held <b>liable</b> for only <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> caused <b>on the property of the injured</b> party, <b>is it not right that</b> one should be <b>exempt in the public domain?</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The verse states</b> in reference to an innocuous ox: “And the carcass <b>they shall</b> also <b>divide”</b> (Exodus 21:35), to indicate that <b>there is no difference</b> with regard to the payment of <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage, whether</b> the damage occurs <b>in a public domain or</b> whether it occurs <b>on private property.</b>
The Gemara suggests a derivation from a different inference: <b>And let a person</b> who inadvertently kills another be <b>liable to pay ransom.</b> This can be inferred <b>via</b> an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, as follows: <b>And if</b> the owner of an <b>ox,</b> who <b>is not liable</b> to pay the <b>four types of indemnity,</b> i.e., pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation, if his ox injures a person, is nevertheless <b>liable to pay ransom</b> if it killed someone, then with regard to <b>a person, who is liable</b> to pay the <b>four types of indemnity</b> if he injures another, <b>is it not right that he should be liable to pay ransom</b> if he were to kill him?
The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to an ox killing a person: “He shall give for the redemption of his life <b>whatever is imposed upon him”</b> (Exodus 21:30). <b>“Upon him”:</b> This means upon the owner of an ox who kills a person, <b>but not upon a person</b> who kills another.
The Gemara suggests the reverse derivation: <b>And let</b> the owner of <b>an ox</b> that injured a person be <b>liable</b> to pay the <b>four types of indemnity.</b> This can be inferred <b>via</b> an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference, as follows: <b>And if a person, who is not obligated to pay ransom</b> if he kills someone, <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>liable</b> to pay <b>four types of indemnity</b> if he injures another, then with regard to the owner of <b>an ox,</b> who <b>is liable to pay ransom, is it not right that he should</b> also <b>be liable</b> to pay the <b>four types of indemnity?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states</b> with regard to this matter: “And if <b>a man</b> maims <b>another”</b> (Leviticus 24:19), from which it can be derived that this <i>halakha</i> applies when a man harms another person <b>but not</b> when <b>an ox</b> harms <b>another</b> person.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>Trampling,</b> in the case of an animal <b>that tramples a child in the courtyard of the injured</b> party and kills the child, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the liability of the owner of the animal <b>to pay ransom?</b> The Gemara explains the different sides of the question: <b>Do we say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is <b>just as it is with regard to Goring?</b> Accordingly, just as with regard to <b>Goring, once</b> an animal has gored <b>two or three times</b> this becomes defined as <b>its usual manner</b> and therefore it is deemed forewarned <b>and</b> the owner must <b>pay ransom</b> in the event that it kills a person by an act classified as Goring, <b>here too it is not different,</b> as with regard to the category of Trampling the owner is deemed forewarned from the start and he must therefore pay ransom.
<b>Or perhaps,</b> should we say that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>Goring</b> is more stringent, as Goring requires the animal’s <b>intent to cause damage,</b> and that is why the owner must pay ransom in the event of a death; but in a case of Trampling, where there is <b>no intent to cause damage,</b> the owner would be exempt from paying ransom?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to this dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>brought his ox into the courtyard of a homeowner without</b> his <b>permission, and it gored the homeowner and he died, the ox</b> is killed <b>by stoning and the owner</b> of the ox is obligated to <b>pay</b> the <b>full</b> amount of the <b>ransom,</b> regardless of <b>whether</b> the animal was <b>innocuous or forewarned.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Tarfon.</b>
The Gemara proceeds to clarify: <b>From where</b> does <b>Rabbi Tarfon</b> derive that <b>with regard to an innocuous</b> ox the owner must also pay the <b>full</b> amount of the <b>ransom?</b> Is it <b>not because he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says</b> that the owner of <b>an innocuous</b> ox that killed a person <b>pays half</b> the <b>ransom</b> if the incident took place <b>in the public domain? And he derived</b> this ruling <b>via</b> an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Trampling:</b> And if in a case of Trampling, for which one is exempted entirely from liability when it occurs in the public domain, one must nevertheless pay the full ransom if the incident took place on the property of the injured party, with regard to Goring, for which one must pay half the ransom when it occurs in the public domain, is it not right that one should be obligated to pay full ransom for an incident that took place on the property of the injured party? <b>Evidently,</b> it is clear that <b>there is a ransom</b> payment <b>in</b> the case of <b>Trampling.</b>
<b>Rav Shimi of Neharde’a said:</b> It is possible to explain that <b>the <i>tanna</i> derived</b> his <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>from damage</b> caused <b>by Trampling:</b> And if in a case of Trampling, for which one is completely exempt from liability when it happens in the public domain, one pays the full cost of the damage done on the property of the injured party, with regard to Goring, for which one must pay half the ransom payment if the ox kills a person in the public domain, is it not right that one would certainly be obligated to pay the full ransom if the person was killed on his own property? According to this reasoning there is no indication that one pays a ransom payment in the case of a child that was killed by Trampling.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if this is the basis for Rabbi Tarfon’s opinion, <b>let</b> the Gemara <b>refute</b> it in this way: <b>What</b> can be learned about ransom <b>from damage</b> caused <b>by Trampling? These</b> same <i>halakhot</i> <b>apply to Fire;</b> nevertheless, there is no obligation to pay ransom when a person is killed by Fire, as was stated explicitly in a <i>baraita</i> above (10a). Consequently, the attempt to derive an <i>a fortiori</i> inference about ransom from Trampling is obviously flawed. The Gemara answers: The <i>a fortiori</i> inference can be <b>based on</b> the damage to <b>concealed</b> articles caused by Trampling on the property of the injured party. One would be exempt for damage such as this if it were caused by Fire.
The Gemara responds to this challenge with a different one: <b>What</b> is notable about damage <b>to concealed</b> articles caused by Trampling? It is notable <b>in that these</b> same <i>halakhot</i> <b>apply to</b> the category of <b>Pit,</b> but nevertheless there is no ransom paid if a person is killed by a pit. Consequently, an attempt to derive an <i>a fortiori</i> inference about ransom from this <i>halakha</i> is obviously flawed. The Gemara answers: The <i>a fortiori</i> inference can be <b>based on</b> damage caused to <b>vessels</b> by Trampling on the property of the injured party. One would be exempt for damage of this nature if it were caused by a pit.
The Gemara rejects this as well: <b>What</b> is notable about damage caused <b>to vessels</b> by Trampling? It is notable <b>in that these</b> same <i>halakhot</i> <b>apply to</b> the category of <b>Fire.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>a fortiori</i> inference can be <b>based on</b> damage caused to <b>concealed vessels</b> by Trampling. In this case, one would be liable for Trampling but exempt from liability for both Fire and Pit, so this can be the basis for the ransom payment, via the <i>a fortiori</i> inference stated by Rav Shimi of Neharde’a. The Gemara rejects this as well: <b>What</b> is notable about damage caused <b>to concealed vessels</b> by Trampling? It is notable <b>in that these</b> same <i>halakhot</i> <b>apply to</b> the category of <b>Man,</b> as a person is liable for damage to these items but does not pay ransom if he inadvertently kills another person.
<b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from it</b> that since the <i>halakhot</i> of the ransom payment with regard to Goring cannot be deduced from the <i>halakhot</i> of damages with regard to Trampling, the <i>tanna</i> <b>derived</b> his <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>based on</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ransom</b> in a case <b>of Trampling,</b> and therefore it may be concluded that <b>apparently there is ransom</b> in a case <b>of Trampling?</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is so. Consequently, in the case of a child trampled to death by Trampling while on his parents’ property, the owner of the animal must pay ransom.
<b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: So too, it is reasonable</b> to say <b>that there is</b> an obligation to pay <b>ransom</b> in a case <b>of Trampling, as, if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>there is no</b> obligation to pay <b>ransom</b> in a case <b>of Trampling, and the <i>tanna</i> derived</b> his <i>a fortiori</i> inference <b>from damage</b> caused <b>by Trampling, let</b> the Gemara <b>refute it</b> in this way: <b>What</b> is notable about <b>damage</b> caused <b>by Trampling?</b> It is notable <b>in that these</b> same <i>halakhot</i> <b>apply to Trampling,</b> while there is no obligation to pay ransom in a case of Trampling. In other words, it would be possible to derive the obligation to pay a full ransom where a person was killed by the Goring of an innocuous ox while on the property of the victim only if there is also an obligation to pay ransom where the person was killed by Trampling.
<b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from it</b> that an <i>a fortiori</i> inference must be <b>based on</b> the obligation to pay <b>ransom</b> in a case <b>of Trampling,</b> and therefore it may be concluded that <b>evidently, there is</b> an obligation to pay <b>ransom</b> in a case <b>of Trampling?</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is so.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The legal status of <b>a person</b> is <b>always</b> that of one <b>forewarned.</b> Therefore, <b>whether</b> the damage was <b>unintentional or intentional, whether</b> he was <b>awake</b> while he caused the damage <b>or asleep,</b> whether <b>he blinded another’s eye or broke vessels, he must pay the full</b> cost of <b>the damage.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers: It <b>teaches</b> in the mishna: <b>He blinded another’s eye,</b> and presumably this is <b>similar to</b> the other example: <b>Broke vessels.</b> From this it can be inferred that <b>just as there,</b> in the case of the broken vessels, <b>yes,</b> one must pay for the <b>damage</b> he caused but he does <b>not</b> pay <b>the four types of indemnity, so too,</b> in a case where <b>he blinds another, yes,</b> he must pay for the <b>damage</b> he caused, but he does <b>not</b> pay <b>the four types of indemnity,</b> since he caused the injury while asleep or unintentionally.

Daf 26b

With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that one must pay the full cost of the damage in a case where there was no intent to cause damage, the Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Ḥizkiyya says, and similarly, the school of Ḥizkiyya taught: The verse states: “Wound for wound [<i>petza taḥat patza</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:25). This phrase is superfluous, as the Torah states elsewhere (see Leviticus 24:19) that one is liable to pay compensation when injuring another. This verse serves <b>to render him liable</b> to pay <b>for the unintentional</b> damage just <b>as</b> he pays <b>for the intentional</b> damage; <b>and</b> he pays <b>for</b> damage caused by <b>accident</b> just <b>as</b> he pays <b>for</b> damage caused <b>willingly.</b>
The Gemara asks: But <b>this</b> verse <b>is necessary</b> in order <b>to</b> indicate that one must <b>pay</b> compensation for <b>pain,</b> even <b>in a case</b> where he pays compensation for <b>damage</b> caused by the injury. Consequently, it seems that that verse cannot also be the source of the principle derived by the school of Ḥizkiyya. The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the superfluous phrase is intended to teach only that, then <b>let the verse write: <i>Petza befatza</i>,</b> which carries the same meaning. <b>What,</b> then, is meant by the superfluous word <i>taḥat</i> in the phrase “<i>petza <b>taḥat patza</b></i><b>”?</b> It indicates that we must <b>derive two</b> conclusions <b>from it:</b> That one is liable to pay for pain even in a case where he pays compensation for damage, and that he is liable for unintentional damage as he is for intentional damage, and for damage caused by accident as for damage caused willingly.
§ <b>Rabba says:</b> If <b>there was a stone lying in</b> one’s <b>lap and</b> he <b>was unaware of it, and he arose and it fell</b> and caused damage, <b>with regard to damages</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay the full cost of the damage caused by the stone. <b>With regard to the four types of indemnity,</b> he is <b>exempt. With regard to Shabbat,</b> if the falling stone caused him to violate one of the prohibited categories of labor; for example, if the stone fell from a private domain to the public domain, he is exempt. The reason is that <b>the Torah prohibited</b> only <b>planned,</b> constructive <b>labor</b> on Shabbat, and he did not plan to perform this labor. <b>With regard to exile,</b> the punishment prescribed for one who unintentionally but negligently kills another, were this stone to kill someone he is <b>exempt,</b> as the incident is deemed accidental.
<b>With regard to</b> a Canaanite <b>slave</b> whose tooth was destroyed or eye was blinded by the stone, potentially enabling the slave to earn his freedom (see Exodus 21:26–27), this is the subject of <b>a dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:25): <b>If the master was a doctor and</b> the slave <b>said to him: Paint</b> the lid of <b>my eye</b> in order to heal it, <b>and</b> the master <b>blinded it</b> during the procedure, or if the slave requested from his master: <b>Scrape my tooth</b> in order to heal it, <b>and</b> the master <b>knocked out</b> the tooth while scraping it, the slave <b>has mocked the master, as he is emancipated</b> due to the act of the master himself.
By contrast, <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The slave is not emancipated in these cases because the verse states: <b>“And destroy it”</b> (Exodus 21:26), from which it is derived that the slave is emancipated <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the master <b>intends to destroy</b> the eye or the tooth, but not if he intended to heal the slave. So too, in the case where a stone fell and accidentally blinded a slave’s eye or knocked out his tooth, according to the Rabbis the slave would be emancipated and according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel he would not.
All of the above cases relate to situations where the individual did not know the stone was in his lap. If <b>he was</b> initially <b>aware of it but forgot about it and he arose and it fell, with regard to damages</b> he is certainly <b>liable,</b> being that he is liable even if he was unaware of the stone. <b>With regard to the four types of indemnity,</b> here too he is <b>exempt,</b> as he did not intend to cause injury. <b>With regard to exile</b> he is <b>liable, as the verse states:</b> “One who <b>unwittingly</b> strikes a person mortally” (Numbers 35:11), indicating <b>by inference that</b> the assailant <b>had</b> some previous <b>awareness, and</b> in this case <b>he was</b> in fact previously <b>aware</b> of the stone in his lap. The term “unwittingly” is employed to describe someone who possessed knowledge of the potential transgression then forgot about it. <b>With regard to Shabbat</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> as this was not a planned, constructive labor. <b>With regard to a slave, the</b> same <b>dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis</b> applies.
In a case where <b>he intended to throw</b> the stone, and he intended to throw it for a distance of only <b>two</b> cubits <b>but</b> instead he <b>threw</b> it a distance of <b>four</b> cubits, as it went farther than he wanted it to go, <b>with regard to damages</b> he is <b>liable. With regard to the four types of indemnity</b> he is <b>exempt. With regard to Shabbat</b> he is exempt, as <b>we require planned,</b> constructive <b>labor</b> as a condition for liability. <b>With regard to exile</b> he is liable, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“If a man lie not in wait”</b> (Exodus 21:13), which serves <b>to exclude</b> from the death penalty a situation where one <b>intended to throw</b> the stone for <b>two</b> cubits <b>but</b> he actually <b>threw</b> it for <b>four</b> cubits, as he did not intend to kill, so he is exiled. <b>With regard to a slave, the</b> same <b>dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis</b> applies.
And if <b>he intended to throw</b> the stone <b>four</b> cubits <b>but</b> instead he <b>threw</b> it <b>eight</b> cubits, <b>with regard to damages</b> he is <b>liable. With regard to the four types of indemnity</b> he is <b>exempt. With regard to Shabbat, if he said</b> to himself when he threw the stone that he would be satisfied <b>wherever it may land,</b> then <b>yes,</b> he is liable, as he intended to throw it a distance of four cubits, which is the minimum necessary to violate the prohibited labor of carrying in the public domain. <b>If</b> he did <b>not</b> throw the stone aimlessly but rather had selected a target that was four cubits away, then he is <b>not</b> liable as he did not perform the precise planned, constructive labor that he had intended. <b>With regard to exile,</b> the Torah states: <b>“If a man lie not in wait”</b> (Exodus 21:13), which serves <b>to exclude</b> from the death penalty a situation where one <b>intended to throw</b> it <b>four</b> cubits <b>but</b> he actually <b>threw</b> it <b>eight</b> cubits, as he did not intend to kill, so he is exiled. <b>With regard to a slave, the</b> same <b>dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis</b> applies.
§ Since the Gemara cited Rabba’s comments about various actions for which the perpetrator is liable with regard to certain matters but exempt with regard to others, the Gemara cites similar rulings: <b>And Rabba says:</b> If one <b>threw a vessel,</b> such as an earthenware jug, <b>from a roof and another came</b> along <b>and broke it with a stick</b> during its descent, the latter is <b>exempt</b> from liability. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is because <b>he broke a broken vessel,</b> meaning that once the vessel was thrown from the roof it was clear that it would be broken upon landing, and therefore it is considered as if it were already broken and the one who broke it while it was still in the air is not liable.
<b>And Rabba says:</b> If one <b>threw a vessel from a roof and there were cushions or blankets below</b> so that if the vessel would land on them it would not break, and then <b>another came and removed</b> the cushions or blankets, <b>or</b> if the individual who threw the vessel went quickly <b>before</b> it landed and <b>removed</b> the cushions or blankets himself, and as a result the vessel shattered, the one who threw the vessel is <b>exempt</b> from liability even though the vessel broke as a consequence of his actions. <b>What is the reason? At the time that he threw</b> the vessel, <b>his arrows were stopped,</b> i.e., what he did at the time he threw the vessel, which is an act comparable to the shooting of an arrow, did not have the capacity to break the vessel. Therefore, he is not viewed as having broken the vessel, and is exempt.
<b>And Rabba says:</b> If one <b>threw a child from a roof and another came</b> along <b>and impaled him on his sword</b> and the child died, the question of who is liable to receive the death penalty for killing the child is dependent upon <b>the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira and the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>ten people beat</b> a victim <b>with ten sticks, whether</b> they did so <b>simultaneously or sequentially, they are all</b>

Daf 27a

<b>exempt,</b> as it is impossible to sentence any one of them to death since no one person killed the victim and there is no death penalty for partially killing a person. <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira says:</b> If they beat him <b>sequentially the last one</b> to beat him is <b>liable</b> for the death of the victim, <b>because he brought</b> the victim’s <b>death closer.</b> So too, in this case, although the first one threw the child, the one to impale him on his sword was the one to hasten his death, and therefore according to Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira he would be liable to receive the death penalty.
The Gemara discusses a similar scenario: If one threw a child from a roof and a forewarned <b>ox came</b> along <b>and impaled</b> the child <b>on its horns</b> and the child died, the question of whether or not the owner of the ox is liable to pay ransom is dependent upon <b>the dispute between Rabbi Yishmael, son of</b> Rabbi <b>Yoḥanan ben Beroka, and the Rabbis. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: <b>“He shall give for the redemption of his life”</b> (Exodus 21:30), indicates that he must pay <b>the value of the injured</b> party, i.e., the one who was killed. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> He must pay <b>the value of the one responsible for the damage.</b> Since the child that was thrown off the roof had no monetary value at the time he was gored by the ox, as it was as if he were already dead, the Rabbis would exempt the owner of the ox from paying ransom. According to Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, the owner of the ox must pay his own value to the family of the victim.
§ <b>Rabba says</b> another similar <i>halakha</i>: If a man <b>fell from a roof and</b> while falling <b>was inserted into a woman</b> due to the force of the fall, but he did not have the intention to engage in sexual intercourse, he is <b>liable to</b> pay <b>the four types of indemnity. And if</b> this woman was <b>his <i>yevama</i></b> waiting for him to perform levirate marriage, <b>he has not acquired</b> her as his wife through this act of intercourse. This is true even though a levirate marriage is ordinarily effected through sexual intercourse, even if unintentional, i.e., if he thought she was someone else. Nevertheless, since in this case he did not intend to engage in intercourse at all, the levirate marriage is not effected.
The Gemara explains: What are the four types of indemnity that he is liable to pay? <b>He is liable</b> to pay <b>for the damage, for the pain, for the medical costs,</b> and <b>for the loss of livelihood. But</b> he is <b>not</b> liable to pay compensation for <b>humiliation, as we learned</b> in a mishna (86a): <b>One is not liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for humiliation unless he intends</b> to humiliate the injured party, and that was certainly not the case in this situation.
<b>And Rabba says</b> another, similar <i>halakha</i>: If one <b>fell from a roof due to an atypical wind,</b> such that it could not have been anticipated in advance that he would fall, <b>and</b> while falling <b>he caused damage and humiliated</b> the injured party, he is <b>liable for the damage</b> but <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>the four types of indemnity,</b> as he did not intend to fall. If he fell <b>due to a typical wind and caused damage and humiliated</b> the injured party while falling, he is <b>liable to</b> pay <b>the four types of indemnity,</b> as his fall was caused by negligence. <b>But</b> he is nevertheless <b>exempt from</b> paying compensation for <b>humiliation,</b> as he did not intend to fall. <b>But if he tumbled</b> while falling so he could fall on this person in order to protect himself from the impact with the ground, he is <b>liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for humiliation as well,</b> because although he did not intend to cause shame he did intend to land on the person.
The <i>halakha</i> that one is exempt from paying compensation for humiliation unless he intended to strike his victim is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From the fact that it is stated: “And she extended her hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:11), <b>do I not know that she took</b> hold of something? Consequently, <b>what</b> is the meaning when further on in <b>the verse</b> it <b>states: “And she took</b> him by his genitals”? It is <b>to teach you that one who intends to cause damage, even if he does not intend to humiliate</b> the injured party, is nevertheless liable to pay compensation for humiliation.
<b>And Rabba says:</b> If one <b>placed</b> a hot <b>coal over another’s heart and</b> the latter was burnt and <b>died,</b> the one who placed the coal is <b>exempt</b> because the victim should have removed the coal from himself, and the one who placed it there did not need to assume that the victim might not remove it. If he placed the coal <b>on</b> the other’s <b>garment and</b> the garment <b>was burnt,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay for the damage, as it is possible that the one whose garment was burnt thought to sue the one who placed the coal on his clothes for the cost of the garment, and that is why he did not bother to remove it.
<b>Rava said: We have learned both</b> of these rulings through intimation in <i>mishnayot</i> elsewhere. With regard to the case of the coal placed <b>over his heart,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 76b): If one <b>held another in a fire or in water, and</b> the victim <b>is unable to extricate himself from there and he dies</b> as a result, the one who attacked him is <b>liable</b> to receive the death penalty as a murderer. If he <b>pushed him into fire or into the water, and</b> the victim <b>is able to extricate himself from there but he dies</b> anyway, the one who attacked him is <b>exempt</b> from the death penalty. The case of one who places a coal on another’s chest is similar to the one where he pushes the victim into the fire or the water in a situation where the victim has the ability to escape.
With regard to the case of one who placed a coal on <b>the garment</b> of another, it is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (92a): If one said to another: <b>Tear my garment,</b> or: <b>Break my jug,</b> and the other person does so, the latter is <b>liable</b> for the damage. But if one said to another: Tear my garment <b>on the condition that</b> you will be <b>exempt</b> from all liability, he is <b>exempt.</b> It is therefore clear that even when one is granted permission by the owner of an item to damage it, that does not grant him an exemption from liability for the damage caused unless that exemption was stated explicitly. Consequently, in a case where the owner did not grant permission, the one who caused the damage is certainly liable.
<b>Rabba raises a dilemma</b> in summation of this discussion: If <b>he placed a coal over the heart of</b> another’s Canaanite <b>slave</b> and the slave died as a result, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the body of the slave <b>comparable to the body</b> of any other person and therefore the assailant would be exempt from liability, <b>or</b> is it <b>comparable to</b> other <b>property</b> owned by the master and therefore the assailant would be liable? Furthermore, <b>if you say</b> that the body of the slave is <b>comparable to the body</b> of any ordinary person, as the slave had the ability to remove the coal from himself and therefore the assailant would be exempt, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in a case where he placed the coal on the other’s <b>ox?</b>
After raising the dilemma Rabba <b>then resolves it:</b> The body of <b>the slave is comparable to the body</b> of any other person, as the slave possesses an intellect and should have the sense to remove the coal from himself, whereas <b>the ox is comparable to</b> other <b>property.</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who places a <i>kad</i>,</b> a type of vessel, <b>in the public domain and another</b> person <b>comes and stumbles on it and breaks it,</b> the other person is <b>exempt</b> from paying for what he broke. <b>And if</b> the one who stumbled <b>incurred damage by</b> it, <b>the owner of the <i>ḥavit</i>,</b> a type of vessel, <b>is liable</b> to pay restitution <b>for his damage.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna <b>began</b> its presentation of the case <b>in</b> reference to <b>a <i>kad</i>,</b> stating: In the case of one who places a <i>kad</i>, <b>and ended</b> it <b>in</b> reference to <b>a <i>ḥavit</i>,</b> stating: The owner of the <i>ḥavit</i> is liable.
<b>And we learned</b> this interchanging of the words <i>kad</i> and <i>ḥavit</i> in a mishna (31b) <b>as well:</b> If two people were walking down the street, <b>this one coming with his <i>ḥavit</i> and that one coming with his</b> cross <b>beam,</b> and <b>this one’s <i>kad</i> was broken by that one’s</b> cross <b>beam,</b> the one holding the beam is <b>exempt.</b> Here too the mishna changed its wording, as it <b>began</b> its statement <b>in</b> reference to <b>a <i>ḥavit</i> and ended</b> it <b>in</b> reference to <b>a <i>kad</i>.</b>
<b>And we learned</b> this in another mishna (115a) <b>as well:</b> If <b>this</b> person <b>came with his <i>ḥavit</i> of wine and that</b> person <b>came with his <i>kad</i> of honey,</b> and <b>the <i>ḥavit</i> of honey,</b> which is more valuable, <b>cracked, and this</b> person <b>poured out his wine and saved the honey</b> by collecting it <b>into</b> his vessel, <b>he</b> receives <b>reimbursement only</b> for his trouble, and he cannot claim the value of the wine that he poured out since the owner of the honey did not tell him to do so. Here too the mishna changed its wording, as it <b>began</b> its statement <b>in</b> reference to <b>a <i>kad</i></b> of honey <b>and ended</b> it <b>in</b> reference to <b>a <i>ḥavit</i></b> of honey.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> These examples show that <b>a <i>kad</i> is</b> the same as <b>a <i>ḥavit</i>,</b> and the two words are used interchangeably. <b>With regard to what</b> does this make <b>a difference?</b> This makes a difference <b>for buying and selling.</b> If a customer asks for a <i>ḥavit</i>, intending a large vessel, and the seller gives him a <i>kad</i>, which is a smaller vessel, the buyer cannot claim that he did not receive the item he asked for.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> where this is relevant? <b>If we say</b> that it is <b>with regard to a locale where</b> people <b>do not refer to a <i>kad</i> as a <i>ḥavit</i>, nor do they refer to a <i>ḥavit</i> as a <i>kad</i>,</b> and a <i>ḥavit</i> is understood to be referring to a larger vessel, clearly one who asks for a <i>ḥavit</i> does not wish to buy a <i>kad</i>, as people <b>do not call it</b> that.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach that they are equivalent terms with regard to a locale <b>where most</b> people <b>call a <i>kad</i> a <i>kad</i> and a <i>ḥavit</i> a <i>ḥavit</i>,</b> i.e., most people use the term <i>kad</i> for the smaller vessel and the term <i>ḥavit</i> for the larger one, <b>and there are also</b> those <b>who call a <i>ḥavit</i> a <i>kad</i> and a <i>kad</i> a <i>ḥavit</i>,</b> not distinguishing between the two terms. <b>Lest you say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> <b>follows the majority</b> and the seller and the buyer must accept this distinction,

Daf 27b

the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> the court <b>does not follow the majority with regard to monetary matters,</b> and in cases of uncertainty the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.
§ The mishna teaches concerning the vessel placed in the public domain: If <b>another</b> person <b>came and stumbled on it and broke it,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is he <b>exempt?</b> Although this happened in the public domain, <b>he should examine</b> the road <b>and</b> then continue <b>walking.</b>
The Sages of the <b>school of Rav said in the name of Rav:</b> The ruling of the mishna is taught <b>with regard to</b> one who placed not just one barrel in the road, but rather <b>filled the entire public domain with barrels,</b> blocking the path. Since the public domain belongs to everyone, a pedestrian is entitled to traverse the road even if it necessitates breaking the vessels. <b>Shmuel says:</b> The ruling of the mishna is <b>taught with regard to</b> a case where he broke it in <b>the dark.</b> Therefore, he could not have avoided breaking the barrel by examining the road in front of him. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The ruling of the mishna is <b>taught with regard to</b> a case where the barrel was placed at <b>the corner</b> of the road, and so the pedestrian could not have seen it, as he rounded the corner, before stumbling on it.
<b>Rav Pappa said: The mishna is precise only according to either</b> the explanation of <b>Shmuel or</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> but not that of Rav. <b>As, if</b> the mishna is explained <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation of <b>Rav, what</b> is the reason it refers <b>specifically</b> to a case where one <b>stumbled</b> on the barrel? <b>Even if he broke</b> the barrel intentionally he should not be liable to pay, as the owner of the barrel had no right to block the public road.
<b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava</b> in defense of Rav’s explanation: <b>The same is true even if he broke</b> the barrel intentionally. <b>And</b> as for <b>this</b> fact, <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> a case where <b>he stumbled,</b> it is <b>because he wants to teach</b> in <b>the last clause: And if he incurred damage due to</b> the vessel, <b>the owner of the <i>ḥavit</i> is liable</b> to pay <b>for his damage. As</b> this ruling applies <b>specifically when he stumbled, but</b> if <b>he broke</b> the barrel intentionally and incurred damage in the process, the owner of the barrel is <b>not</b> required to compensate him. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Although the pedestrian had the right to break the barrel, <b>it is he who damaged himself,</b> by not being careful while breaking it. Therefore, in <b>the first clause</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> a case where <b>he stumbled.</b> Accordingly, the mishna’s wording is precise according to Rav’s explanation as well.
<b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi</b> that <b>this is what they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rabbi Ulla,</b> in explanation of the mishna: Even if the barrel is clearly visible, one who stumbles on it is exempt from liability <b>because the</b> typical <b>manner of people is not to examine the roads,</b> as they assume that the road is unobstructed. Therefore, one who breaks an item placed in the road as a result of not watching is not liable to pay restitution.
The Gemara relates: <b>There was an incident in Neharde’a</b> where a pedestrian stumbled on a jug in an open area and broke it, <b>and Shmuel deemed him liable</b> to pay for the damage. A similar incident took place <b>in Pumbedita, and Rava deemed</b> the person <b>liable</b> to pay.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, Shmuel</b> ruled <b>in accordance with his halakhic</b> opinion that the exemption stated in the mishna refers specifically to a case where one stumbles in the dark, as otherwise he is liable for breaking the barrel, since he should have examined the road. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>Rava, shall we say that he holds in accordance with Shmuel’s</b> opinion that one who breaks an item in the public domain is exempt from paying for it only if it was dark?
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> That inference is not necessary, as this incident <b>was</b> at <b>the corner where</b> there was an olive <b>press [<i>de’atzera</i>],</b> where it is known that people put their jugs down while waiting for oil. Consequently, <b>since they were acting with permission,</b> a pedestrian <b>should examine</b> the road <b>and</b> then continue <b>walking.</b>
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda sent</b> the following question <b>to Rav Naḥman:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that when one strikes another, humiliating him, the judges determine liability according to the following formula: <b>For kneeing [<i>rekhuva</i>]</b> him, he must pay <b>three</b> <i>sela</i>; <b>for kicking, five; and for punching [<i>velisnokeret</i>]</b> him, <b>thirteen.</b> The Gemara asks: If so <b>for</b> hitting him with <b>the handle of a hoe [<i>demara</i>] and for</b> hitting him with <b>the top [<i>ulkofina</i>] of a hoe, what</b> amount is one liable to pay him?
Rav Naḥman <b>sent him</b> the following response: <b>Ḥisda, Ḥisda, are you collecting a fine</b> for humiliation <b>in Babylonia,</b> where judges are not authorized to collect fines? <b>Tell me how the incident itself</b> transpired.
Rav Ḥisda <b>sent him</b> in response: There is <b>a certain cistern belonging to two</b> people whose arrangement was to alternate its use so <b>that every day one of them would draw</b> from it in turn. It happened that <b>one of them came and was drawing</b> water <b>on a day that was not his</b> turn. His co-owner <b>said to him: This is my day</b> to draw, not yours. His colleague <b>did not pay attention to him.</b> The person whose turn it was therefore <b>took the handle of a hoe</b> and <b>struck</b> the person who was stealing his water, who then sued for damages.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> In that case, he was right to do so, and he <b>should</b> have <b>hit him</b> even <b>a hundred times with the hoe. Even according to the one who says</b> that <b>a person may not take justice into his own</b> hands but should go to court, in a case <b>where</b> there would be <b>a loss</b> involved if no immediate action is taken, <b>a person may take justice into his own</b> hands.
This is <b>as it was stated,</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says: A person may not take justice into his own</b> hands, whereas <b>Rav Naḥman says: A person may take justice into his own</b> hands.
<b>Where there is</b> an imminent <b>loss</b> that will be suffered if the injured party does not take action, <b>everyone agrees that a person may take justice into his own</b> hands. <b>They disagree</b> only <b>when there is no</b> imminent <b>loss</b> that will be suffered. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>a person may not take justice into his own</b> hands, <b>because since there is no loss, he should go before the judge</b> to have him enforce the law. <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>a person may take justice into his own</b> hands. <b>Since he is acting lawfully,</b> as he is clearly in the right, <b>he need not trouble</b> himself to go before the judge to have him enforce the law.
<b>Rav Kahana raises an objection</b> to Rav Yehuda’s opinion based on a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Ben Bag Bag says: Do not enter another</b> person’s <b>courtyard</b> secretly <b>to take what is</b> rightfully <b>yours without permission, lest you appear to him as a thief</b> trying to steal his property. <b>Rather, break his teeth,</b> i.e., take it by force, <b>and say to him: I am taking what is mine.</b> Evidently one may take justice into his own hands.
Rav Yehuda <b>said to him:</b>

Daf 28a

You can keep this question <b>to yourself,</b> as it poses no difficulty at all. <b>Ben Bag Bag</b> states <b>an individual</b> opinion in this regard, <b>and the Rabbis disagree with him.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yannai says</b> an alternative response to Rav Kahana’s objection: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean by the phrase: <b>Break his teeth?</b> It means sue him <b>in judgment.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the subsequent statement in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And say to him,</b> is inaccurate. It <b>should have</b> stated: <b>And they,</b> the court, <b>say to him.</b> Likewise, the wording: <b>I am taking what is mine,</b> is inaccurate. Since it is the court who makes this statement, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> stated: <b>He is taking what is his.</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, this poses <b>a difficulty</b> for Rav Yehuda’s version of the response.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an alternative proof for Rav Naḥman’s opinion. It is stated in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an ox that climbed on the back of another</b> ox <b>to kill it, and the owner of the</b> ox on the <b>bottom came and removed his</b> ox, <b>and the</b> ox <b>on top</b> consequently <b>fell and died,</b> the owner of the ox on the bottom is <b>exempt</b> from paying for the dead ox. <b>What, is</b> this ruling <b>not</b> stated <b>with regard to</b> a case where the attacker is <b>a forewarned</b> ox, <b>where there is no loss</b> to the owner of the bottom ox, since even if the owner of the ox on the bottom does not remove his ox, he will eventually receive full restitution from the owner of the belligerent ox? Yet he is exempt from paying restitution for causing the death of the belligerent ox. Evidently, he had the right to take justice into his own hands.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No,</b> the ruling is <b>with regard to</b> a case where the attacker is <b>an innocuous</b> ox, <b>where there is a loss</b> for the owner of the ox on the bottom if he does not save it, since the owner of an innocuous ox pays for only half the damages resulting from his ox’s attack.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>: If, instead of removing his own ox, the owner of the ox on the bottom <b>pushed the one on top and it died,</b> he is <b>liable. And if</b> it is referring <b>to an innocuous</b> ox, <b>why</b> is he <b>liable?</b> He is defending his property so as not to incur a loss.
The Gemara answers: He is liable <b>because he should have removed</b> his ox from underneath the belligerent ox, <b>and he did not remove it.</b> Instead, he pushed the belligerent ox and caused it to die. Although one may take justice into his own hands, if he damages another person’s property when he could have protected his own property in a harmless manner he is liable.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for Rav Naḥman’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who fills another’s courtyard with jugs of wine and jugs of oil, the owner of the courtyard may break</b> his way through them <b>and exit</b> his courtyard or he <b>may break</b> his way through them <b>and enter</b> his courtyard. Since the one who put the jugs there had no right to do so, the owner of the courtyard may take justice into his own hands. This is apparently the ruling even where there is no loss involved to the owner of the courtyard.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> in response that the <i>baraita</i> can be explained as follows: The owner of the courtyard <b>may break</b> the jugs <b>and exit to court,</b> and he <b>may break</b> the jugs <b>and enter</b> his house <b>to bring</b> proof of <b>his rights,</b> i.e., documents proving that the courtyard belongs to him. Since by refraining from doing so he would sustain a loss, he may break the jugs when exiting and entering. He may not take justice into his own hands beyond this extent. Therefore, no proof for Rav Naḥman’s opinion can be inferred from this <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an alternative proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived with regard <b>to a Hebrew slave</b> who had his ear <b>pierced</b> with an awl to extend his tenure as a slave, but <b>whose days</b> of servitude <b>have</b> now <b>ended</b> with the arrival of the Jubilee Year; <b>and his master is urging [<i>mesarhev</i>] him to leave</b> but he insists on remaining; <b>and</b> the master <b>injured</b> the slave <b>and inflicted an injury on him</b> in the process of forcing him out, <b>that</b> the master <b>is exempt</b> from paying for this injury?
To counter this, <b>the verse states: “You shall take no ransom…that he should return”</b> (Numbers 35:32). Although this verse is referring to the prohibition against an unintentional killer paying a ransom instead of going to a city of refuge, this verse is also interpreted to mean that <b>you shall take no ransom for</b> a Hebrew slave who is obligated to <b>return</b> to his family. In other words, if the slave refuses to return to his family and is injured in the process of his eviction, he does not receive compensation. This seems to indicate that the master may take justice into his own hands even for a matter that involves no loss to him.
The Gemara responds to this proof: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with a slave</b> who is <b>a thief,</b> and consequently, if he remains a slave, his master will sustain a loss. Therefore, it is permitted for the master to take justice into his own hands and evict the slave by force.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>Until now he did not steal, and now he will</b> begin to <b>steal?</b> Why would the master be worried about this just when the slave’s tenure ends? The Gemara answers: <b>Until now,</b> while he was still a slave, <b>the awe of his master was upon him,</b> so he did not steal from him. <b>Now</b> that he may go free <b>he does not have the awe of his master upon him,</b> and the master is therefore worried that he might steal from him.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> an alternative explanation: The <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a slave whose master provided a Canaanite maidservant to him</b> as a wife and he wishes to remain with her. <b>Until now,</b> it was <b>permitted</b> for him to engage in sexual intercourse with her, <b>but now</b> that he is free, it is <b>prohibited</b> for him to do so. In this case, his master may evict him forcefully, assuming the role of an emissary of the court, to prevent him from violating the prohibition. Therefore, this is not considered taking justice into his own hands.
The Gemara suggests a proof for Rav Yehuda’s opinion from the mishna. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> In the case of <b>one who places a jug in the public domain and another</b> person <b>comes and stumbles on it and breaks it,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> It may be inferred that <b>the reason</b> he is exempt <b>is that he stumbled on it. But</b> if <b>he broke it</b> intentionally, he is <b>liable.</b> This indicates that one may not take justice into his own hands.
<b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava:</b> That is not a proof, as <b>the same is true even if he broke</b> the barrel intentionally. <b>And</b> as for <b>this</b> fact <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> a case where <b>he stumbled,</b> it is <b>because he wants to teach</b> in <b>the last clause:</b> And <b>if he incurred damage due to</b> the vessel, <b>the owner of the <i>ḥavit</i> is liable</b> to pay <b>for his damages. As</b> this ruling applies <b>specifically when he stumbled, but</b> if <b>he broke</b> the barrel intentionally and incurred damage in the process, the owner of the barrel is <b>not</b> required to compensate him. Although the pedestrian had the right to break the barrel, <b>it is he who damaged himself,</b> by not being careful while breaking it. Therefore, in <b>the first clause</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> a case where <b>he stumbled.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>, which relates to the case of a woman who, during a fight between her husband and another man, grabs the other man’s genitals: The verse that states: <b>“Then you shall cut off her hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:12), should not be taken literally; rather, it is referring to <b>monetary restitution. What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where she cannot save</b> her husband from his attacker <b>by a means other</b> than grabbing the attacker’s genitals, and nevertheless she is punished? This indicates that one may not take justice into his own hands. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the verse is referring to a case <b>where she can save</b> him <b>by other means.</b> Otherwise she is exempt from paying restitution.
The Gemara asks: <b>But if she cannot save</b> him <b>by other means,</b> is it possible that <b>she</b> is <b>exempt? If so, instead of teaching</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i> that the expression mentioned in the previous verse: <b>“And extended her hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:11), <b>excludes an emissary of the court,</b> who is authorized to act in this manner and is therefore exempt from paying restitution, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>distinguish and teach within</b> the case under discussion in the verse <b>itself,</b> as follows: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that the wife is liable <b>said?</b> It is <b>in</b> a case <b>where she can save</b> her husband <b>by another means. But</b> if <b>she cannot save</b> him <b>by other means, she</b> is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>That is also what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>in</b> a case <b>where she can save</b> him <b>by other means. But</b> if <b>she cannot save</b> him <b>by other means, her hand is rendered like an emissary of the court, and she is exempt.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for Rav Yehuda’s opinion from a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 99b): In a case <b>where a public thoroughfare would pass through</b> one’s <b>field,</b> and <b>he appropriated it and</b> instead <b>gave</b> the public an alternative route <b>on the side</b> of his property, the <i>halakha</i> is that the route <b>that he has given</b> is the route <b>that he gave</b> them, and they may use it. <b>But his</b> property, which he appropriated, <b>has not reached him,</b> i.e., he cannot appropriate it for his personal use since it was already in public use.
<b>And if you say that a person may take justice into his own</b> hands, why does the owner of the field not have the right to close the thoroughfare? Since it is his property and he gave the public an alternative route, <b>let him take a stick [<i>pazra</i>]</b> in his hand <b>and sit</b> by the side of the road, preventing the public from passing through.
<b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava: It is</b> a rabbinic <b>decree, lest he give them a circuitous route.</b> Since the public has the right to pass through his field, as the Gemara will soon explain, the owner cannot appropriate their thoroughfare without giving the public a similar alternative route. Therefore, the Sages decreed that he cannot appropriate it without their consent, lest he provide an inadequate route.
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where he</b> actually <b>gave them a circuitous route.</b> If one in fact gives the public a straight path, he need not surrender his rights, and he may take justice into his own hands by blocking the original thoroughfare.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Any</b> route <b>on the side</b> that the property owner might give them <b>is</b> necessarily considered <b>a circuitous route,</b> as <b>it is close for this</b> person, <b>and it is far for that</b> person. While some will benefit from the change, it will be detrimental for others.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why has his</b> property <b>not reached him?</b> If he cannot make the change, why can he not reclaim the path that he intended to turn over to the public? <b>Let him say to them: Take your</b> original route <b>and give me</b> back <b>my</b> property, so that he will not lose both pieces of land.
The Gemara answers that he cannot reclaim it <b>due to Rav Yehuda’s</b> statement, <b>as Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>a path that the masses established</b> as a public thoroughfare, <b>it is prohibited to destroy it</b> for them. Therefore, since the public already began using the alternative route, the owner cannot appropriate it from them.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an alternative proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the owner</b> of a field <b>who left produce in the corner of the field, which is given to the poor [<i>pe’a</i>], on one side</b> of the field, <b>and poor people came and took from another side, this</b> produce <b>and that</b> produce are both considered <b><i>pe’a</i>. And if you say that a person may take justice into his own</b> hands, <b>why</b> are <b>this and that</b> both considered <b><i>pe’a</i>? Let him take a stick and sit</b> in his field on the side from which the poor people are taking produce without his permission, and let him warn them to take only from the side that he allocated.
<b>Rava said:</b> In terms of monetary law he can prevent them from taking <i>pe’a</i> from the side that he did not allocate. <b>What</b> is meant by the ruling of: <b>This</b> produce <b>and that</b> produce are both considered <b><i>pe’a</i>?</b> It means that they are considered <i>pe’a</i> <b>with regard to exempting</b> both portions of produce <b>from tithes.</b> Just as the portion that the poor people took is exempt from tithes, so is the portion that he allocated initially.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who renounces ownership of his vineyard and arose early in the morning</b> before anyone else took possession of it <b>and harvested it,</b> the one who renounces ownership <b>is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>individual fallen</b> grapes left for the poor [<b><i>peret</i></b>], <b>and in</b> the mitzva of <b>incompletely formed clusters</b> of grapes left for the poor [<b><i>olelot</i></b>], <b>and in</b> the mitzva of <b>forgotten</b> clusters of grapes left for the poor, <b>and in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>pe’a</i>,</b> the four gifts to the poor that the Torah requires one to give from a vineyard (see Leviticus 19:9–10). <b>But he is exempt from the</b> mitzva to <b>tithe</b> his produce, because this requirement does not apply to an ownerless field. Likewise, in the above case the portion of the field that was allocated for <i>pe’a</i> is exempt from tithes even after the owner reclaims it, as <i>pe’a</i> is considered ownerless property in this regard.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one’s <b>jug broke in the public domain and</b> another person <b>slipped in the water</b> from the jug and was injured from the fall, <b>or</b> if he <b>was injured by the shards</b> of the broken jug, the owner of the jug is <b>liable. Rabbi Yehuda says: In</b> a case where the owner of the jug acted <b>with intent,</b> he is <b>liable,</b> and <b>in</b> a case where he acted <b>without intent,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: They taught</b> that the owner of the jug is liable <b>only when the clothes of</b> the one who slipped <b>were soiled by the</b> dirty <b>water.</b>

Daf 28b

<b>But</b> if the person <b>himself</b> was injured, the owner of the jug is <b>exempt,</b> as it is <b>the ground</b> that <b>caused his injury,</b> not the jug or the water.
Rav Yehuda continued: <b>When I stated this</b> ruling of Rav <b>before Shmuel, he said to me: After all, we derive</b> the cases of damage caused by leaving <b>one’s stone, one’s knife, or one’s load</b> in the public domain <b>from</b> the case of <b>one’s pit, and I</b> therefore <b>read,</b> i.e., apply, <b>with regard to all of them</b> the inference of the Sages from the verse: “And an ox or a donkey fall therein” (Exodus 21:33), that the one who dug the pit is liable only if what incurred damage is <b>an ox, but not a person,</b> or <b>a donkey, but not vessels.</b>
<b>And this statement applies with regard to</b> a situation where the person is <b>killed,</b> i.e., if one fell into a pit and was killed, the person who dug it is exempt from paying restitution, since the verse refers exclusively to an animal that was killed. <b>But with regard to damage,</b> the digger of the pit is <b>liable</b> to pay restitution for injury to <b>a person, but exempt</b> from paying restitution for damage to <b>vessels,</b> for which no distinction between death and injury can be applied. Therefore, the ruling in the case of the jug that broke in the public domain should be the opposite. The owner of the jug is liable to pay restitution for injury caused to another, as Shmuel holds that he is liable even if the injury is caused by the impact with the ground, but that he is exempt from paying restitution for the damage done to the clothes of the one who slipped.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how would <b>Rav</b> answer this difficulty? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> presumption that liability for damage caused by one’s stone, knife, or load is derived from the category of Pit, thereby exempting him from payment for damage to vessels, <b>applies</b> only in a case <b>where he renounced ownership of them. But</b> in a case <b>where he did not renounce ownership of them, it is</b> considered to be like any other case where <b>his property</b> causes damage. Therefore, he is liable to pay for damage caused to the vessels.
<b>Rav Oshaya raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> discussing Pit: It is derived from the verse: “And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, <b>and an ox or a donkey fall therein”</b> (Exodus 21:33), that the digger is liable to pay restitution only if what incurred damage is <b>an ox but not a person,</b> or <b>a donkey but not vessels. From here</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> that if <b>an ox with its equipment fell into</b> a pit, and the ox was wounded <b>and</b> the equipment <b>broke;</b> or if <b>a donkey with its equipment</b> fell in, and the donkey was wounded <b>and</b> the equipment <b>tore,</b> then the one who dug the pit is <b>liable</b> to pay restitution <b>for</b> any injury sustained by <b>the animal but exempt</b> from paying restitution <b>for the</b> damaged <b>equipment. To what</b> case <b>is this similar?</b> It is similar <b>to</b> the case of <b>his stone, or his knife, or his load that he left in the public domain, and they caused damage.</b>
The Gemara questions the wording of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>On the contrary, it should have</b> stated: <b>What is similar to this,</b> since the cases of one’s stone, knife, or load are not mentioned in the Torah, but are derived from the case of Pit. <b>Rather,</b> the wording should be emended as follows: <b>What is similar to this?</b> It is the case of <b>his stone, or his knife, or his load that he left in the public domain, and they caused damage.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Therefore,</b> if one <b>dropped his flask on a stone</b> that was left in the public domain, breaking the flask, the owner of the stone is <b>liable.</b>
<b>The first clause</b> of this <i>baraita</i> is <b>difficult according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> since it compares the cases of a stone, a knife, and a load to the case of Pit, and it does not distinguish between a situation in which he renounced ownership of them or one where he did not. <b>And the last clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, which deems the owner of a stone in the public domain liable to pay restitution for the damage to the broken flask, is <b>difficult according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel.</b> According to him, the owner should be liable only for causing injury and not for damaging vessels.
The Gemara responds to this objection: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>itself should pose a difficulty for you,</b> since <b>the first clause</b> states that one is <b>exempt</b> from liability for damage to vessels, <b>and the last clause</b> states that he is <b>liable.</b>
<b>Rather, Rav resolves</b> the contradiction according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, and Shmuel resolves</b> it according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning.</b>
<b>Rav resolves</b> it according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning</b> as follows: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> Concerning what case does the <i>baraita</i> rule that a stone, a knife, and a load are analogous to Pit, exempting their owner from liability for breakage to vessels caused by them? It is <b>where he renounced ownership of them. But</b> if <b>he did not renounce ownership of them he is liable. Therefore,</b> if one <b>dropped his flask on a stone</b> belonging to another person in the public domain, the owner of the stone is <b>liable</b> to pay for the damage to the flask.
<b>And Shmuel resolves</b> the contradiction according <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning: Now that you said</b> that the cases of <b>one’s stone, one’s knife, and one’s load are similar to one’s pit,</b> then <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda, who deems</b> one <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for damage</b> caused <b>to vessels by</b> falling into <b>a pit</b> that he dug, one is <b>therefore liable</b> in a case where someone <b>dropped his flask on</b> a <b>stone</b> belonging to him, and the flask broke.
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar says: They taught</b> that the owner of the stone is liable <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the pedestrian <b>stumbled on the stone and</b> the flask <b>scraped against the stone</b> and broke. <b>But</b> if <b>he stumbled on the ground,</b> not the stone, <b>and</b> the flask consequently fell and <b>scraped against the stone,</b> causing the flask to break, the owner of the stone is <b>exempt</b> from liability for the damage.
<b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this statement? It is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan,</b> who maintains that if damage is caused by two people and one of them is exempt from paying compensation, the other must pay the entire amount. Similarly here, since there is no liability for damage caused by stumbling on the ground, compensation should be collected from the owner of the stone.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> an alternative version of this discourse: <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Do not say</b> that it is only in a case <b>where</b> the pedestrian <b>stumbled on the stone and</b> the flask <b>scraped against the stone,</b> causing the flask to break, <b>that</b> he <b>is deemed liable, but</b> that if <b>he stumbled on the ground and</b> the flask <b>scraped against the stone,</b> causing the flask to break, he is <b>exempt. Rather, even</b> if the pedestrian <b>stumbled on the ground and</b> the flask <b>scraped against the stone,</b> causing the flask to break, he is <b>liable. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this statement? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that if someone’s jug broke in the public domain and one slipped in the water from the jug and was injured from the fall, or if he was injured by the shards of the broken jug, the owner of the jug is liable. Rabbi Yehuda says: In a case where the owner of the jug acted <b>with intent,</b> he is liable, and in a case where he acted without intent, he is exempt. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which it is considered that he acted with <b>intent?</b>
<b>Rabba says:</b> Even <b>where he</b> just <b>intends to lower</b> the jug <b>off his shoulder</b> and accidentally breaks it, he is liable to pay for the damage he causes, according to Rabbi Yehuda. <b>Abaye said to him: By inference, does Rabbi Meir,</b> who is the anonymous first <i>tanna</i> of the mishna, <b>deem</b> him <b>liable even</b> if the jug <b>cracked</b> by itself? Rabba <b>said to him: Indeed, Rabbi Meir would deem</b> him <b>liable even</b> if he were holding <b>the handle of</b> the jug <b>in his hand,</b> the optimal manner for holding it, and the handle snapped, causing the jug to fall and break, an accident clearly beyond his control.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is this so? Isn’t he the <b>victim of circumstances beyond his control? And the Merciful One exempts</b> a victim of <b>circumstances beyond his control</b> from punishment, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to a betrothed young woman who is raped: <b>“But to the young woman you shall do nothing”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:26).
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>this matter applies</b> only <b>with regard to</b> exemption from the <b>death</b> penalty, <b>but with regard to damages</b> one is <b>liable</b> even for circumstances beyond his control, <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one’s <b>jug broke and he did not remove its</b> shards, or if <b>his camel</b> fell <b>and he did not stand it up, Rabbi Meir deems him liable</b> to pay <b>for</b> any <b>damage</b> they cause, <b>and the Rabbis say</b> that

Daf 29a

he is <b>exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And the Rabbis concede to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir in</b> the cases of <b>one’s stone, one’s knife, or one’s load, that</b> if <b>he placed them on top of his roof and they fell</b> as a result of being blown off <b>by a typical wind,</b> i.e., one of ordinary force, <b>and they caused damage, that</b> he is <b>liable. And Rabbi Meir concedes to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis in</b> the case of one who <b>puts pitchers [<i>kankanin</i>] on the roof in order to dry them, and they fell</b> as a result of being blown off <b>by an atypical wind,</b> i.e., one of unusual force, <b>and they caused damage, that</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> Evidently, even Rabbi Meir concedes that if one’s property causes damage due to circumstances completely beyond his control, he is exempt.
Accordingly, Abaye rejects Rabba’s explanation of Rabbi Yehuda’s statement, that he deems the owner of the jug liable even if he merely attempted to take it off his shoulder and it broke, and offers another explanation. <b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree with regard to two</b> different situations. <b>They disagree</b> with regard to a situation where the damage was caused <b>at the time of</b> the person’s <b>fall, and they disagree</b> with regard to a situation where the damage was caused <b>after</b> the person’s <b>fall.</b>
<b>They disagree</b> in a situation where the damage was caused <b>at the time of</b> the person’s <b>fall, with regard to</b> whether or not <b>one who stumbles,</b> thereby causing his jug to break, is considered <b>negligent.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>one who stumbles</b> is considered <b>negligent,</b> as his carelessness caused him to stumble. Therefore, he is liable to pay for damage caused by the shards of the jug, which broke as result of his stumbling. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>one who stumbles is not</b> considered <b>negligent.</b>
<b>They disagree</b> in a situation where the damage was caused <b>after</b> the person’s <b>fall, with regard to one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property.</b> Presumably, the owner of the jug has no interest in keeping the shards, and it is considered as though he renounced his ownership of them. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that <b>one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property is liable</b> to pay restitution for damage caused by it, despite the fact that it no longer belongs to him. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>he is exempt</b> from paying restitution, as it does not belong to him anymore.
<b>And from where</b> is this interpretation derived? It is derived <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches two</b> possible cases of damage, stating: Another person <b>slipped in the water or was injured by the shards. This</b> case, slipping in the water, <b>is</b> seemingly identical to <b>that</b> case, injured by the shards. <b>Rather, is it not</b> necessary to explain that <b>this is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> Another person <b>slipped in the water at the time of</b> the person’s <b>fall, or was injured by the shards after</b> the person’s <b>fall?</b>
The Gemara infers: <b>And since</b> the dispute in <b>the mishna is with regard to two</b> situations, the dispute in <b>the <i>baraita</i></b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis must <b>also</b> relate <b>to two</b> situations, as there too, two cases are mentioned, a case where one’s jug broke and a case where one’s camel fell. Apparently, the dispute is with regard to damage caused both at the time of the fall and after the fall. Rabbi Meir holds that one who stumbles and breaks his jug, causing damage to others, is considered negligent and that one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property is liable, and the Rabbis disagree with regard to both issues.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> with regard to the case where <b>one’s jug</b> broke, <b>you find</b> these circumstances <b>either at the time of the fall or after the fall. But</b> with regard to the case where <b>his camel</b> fell, <b>granted, you find</b> this circumstance <b>after the fall, when he renounces his ownership of the carcass,</b> not considering it worth keeping, <b>but how can you find</b> these circumstances <b>at the time of the fall?</b> How can the camel’s falling be considered to be due to the owner’s negligence, possibly rendering him liable to pay for injuries caused by it?
<b>Rav Aḥa said: For example,</b> in a case <b>where</b> the camel <b>crossed through water, through the inundation [<i>serata</i>] of a river</b> that overflowed its banks, and it stumbled there, the owner was negligent, as he should not have gone this way.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If there was another route,</b> and he nevertheless chose this one, <b>he is</b> clearly <b>negligent</b> according to all opinions. <b>And if there was no other route, he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control,</b> and he is exempt from liability according to all opinions.
<b>Rather, you find</b> this circumstance in a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>stumbled and the camel</b> then <b>stumbled on him.</b> In this case, the Sages engage in a dispute whether or not one who stumbles is considered negligent.
The Gemara asks: According to Abaye’s explanation that the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda is with regard to a situation where the owner of the jug <b>renounces ownership of his hazardous property</b> after it falls, <b>what</b> is the meaning of Rabbi Yehuda’s statement that if the owner of the jug acted <b>with intent</b> he is liable? What intention <b>is there</b> after the jug fell and broke?
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> It is a situation <b>where he intends to acquire the shards</b> of the broken jug, and he does not renounce his ownership of them. It is specifically in that case that Rabbi Yehuda holds him liable to pay for damage caused by the shards. <b>And similarly, Rav Ashi said:</b> It is a situation <b>where he intends to acquire the shards.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar says: The dispute</b> in the <i>baraita</i> is with regard to a situation where the damage occurred <b>at the time of</b> the person’s <b>fall.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But after the fall,</b> according to this statement, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does <b>everyone agree</b> that the owner of the jug is <b>exempt</b> from liability? <b>But isn’t there Rabbi Meir, who deems</b> him <b>liable,</b> since he did not remove the shards? <b>Rather, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does <b>everyone agree</b> that <b>he is liable? But aren’t there the Rabbis, who deem</b> him <b>exempt?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, what</b> is the explanation of the phrase: <b>At the time of</b> the person’s <b>fall?</b> It means <b>even at the time of</b> the person’s <b>fall, and</b> it <b>teaches us</b> that the dispute is referring to a situation where the damage occurred after the fall and also to a situation where it occurred at the time of the fall, <b>in accordance with Abaye’s</b> explanation of the mishna.

Daf 29b

<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> is with regard to a situation where the damage occurred <b>after the fall.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But at the time of</b> the person’s <b>fall,</b> according to this statement, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does <b>everyone agree</b> that the owner of the jug is <b>exempt</b> from liability? <b>But from the fact that Rabbi Yoḥanan says later</b> (31a), with regard to another mishna in this chapter: <b>Do not say that the mishna is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>one who stumbles is</b> considered <b>negligent, by inference</b> it is clear <b>that</b> he holds that <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> one who stumbles <b>liable</b> to pay damages. Evidently, it is not unanimously agreed upon that he is exempt.
<b>Rather, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case? <b>Does</b> he say that <b>everyone agrees that he is liable? But from the fact</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says later: Do not say that the mishna is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>one who stumbles is</b> considered <b>negligent, by inference</b> it is clear <b>that</b> he holds that <b>the Rabbis deem</b> him <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, this</b> is what Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>teaches us: That</b> the circumstance in <b>which the Rabbis deem one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property exempt is</b> only the situation stated <b>here,</b> i.e., where he stumbled, <b>as he is the victim of circumstances beyond his control. But in the general</b> case of <b>one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property, they deem</b> him <b>liable</b> to pay for damage caused by it.
§ It <b>was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property</b> that he left in the public domain, there is a dispute between the <i>amora’im</i> <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar. One said</b> that he is <b>liable, and one said</b> that he is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>the one who deems</b> him <b>liable</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and the one who deems</b> him <b>exempt</b> holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b>
The Gemara responds: No; <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, everyone agrees</b> that one who renounces owner-ship over his hazardous property is liable. Rather, <b>when they disagree</b> it <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> They disagree as to what the opinion of the Rabbis is. <b>The one who deems</b> him <b>exempt</b> holds that his opinion <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And the one who deems</b> him <b>liable</b> could have <b>said to you: I</b> maintain <b>that</b> what <b>I say is</b> correct <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis; the Rabbis deem one who renounces ownership over his hazardous property exempt only</b> in the situation <b>here, because he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control. But</b> in <b>a general</b> case of <b>one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property, they deem</b> him <b>liable.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>It may be concluded that Rabbi Elazar is the one who says</b> that <b>he is liable, as Rabbi Elazar says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> There are <b>two entities</b> that <b>are not in a person’s</b> legal <b>possession and</b> nevertheless <b>the verse rendered them as though they were in his possession</b> with regard to certain halakhic responsibilities. <b>And these are: A pit</b> that he dug <b>in the public domain and leavened bread</b> remaining in his possession on the eve of Passover <b>from six hours,</b> i.e., noon, <b>onward.</b> Although deriving any benefit from the bread is prohibited, and it is therefore no longer in its owner’s legal possession, nevertheless he is commanded to destroy it. The Gemara concludes: <b>It may be concluded</b> that Rabbi Elazar is the one who says that he is liable.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Elazar</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that one who renounces ownership of his hazardous objects is liable? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Elazar say the opposite? As we learned</b> in a mishna (30a): In the case of <b>one who turns over dung in the public domain and another</b> person <b>incurred damage due to it,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for his damage. And Rabbi Elazar says: They taught</b> this ruling <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the one who turned over the dung <b>intended to acquire it, but</b> in a case where <b>he did not intend to acquire it</b> he is <b>exempt. Apparently,</b> according to Rabbi Elazar, <b>one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property is exempt,</b> since he is liable only if he intends to take possession of the dung, even if he moved it significantly.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> Rabbi Elazar was referring to a case <b>where he returned</b> the dung <b>to its</b> prior <b>place.</b> Therefore, he is exempt unless he intended to acquire it. <b>Ravina said:</b> This can be explained by means of <b>a parable: To what is</b> the statement of <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava comparable? To one who finds an uncovered pit</b> in the public domain <b>and covers it, and</b> then <b>uncovers it again.</b> Since he left the pit as he found it, he is exempt from paying damages, and the liability lies with the one who dug the pit.
<b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, said to Ravina: Is</b> this <b>comparable? There,</b> in the case of the pit, the result of <b>the initial act</b> of digging the pit <b>was not removed,</b> since even when he covered the pit, the pit itself still existed. But <b>here,</b> the result of <b>the initial act was removed,</b> since once the dung was moved from its prior place, there was no longer any hazardous object there. Therefore, by returning it to its place, the hazard is created anew.
Rather, <b>it is comparable only to one who finds an uncovered pit and fills it</b> with dirt <b>and</b> then <b>digs it up again, as</b> in this case the result of <b>the initial act is removed, and</b> the new pit therefore <b>exists in his possession</b> and he is liable. Likewise, one who moves dung in the public domain and then restores it to its prior place is deemed liable whether or not he intends to acquire it.
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said</b> that Rabbi Elazar was referring to a case <b>when he turned it over at</b> a height of <b>less than three</b> handbreadths, which is not considered removal of the dung from its place.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this explanation, <b>what forced Rabbi Elazar to interpret</b> the mishna as referring specifically to the unique case <b>where he turned over</b> the dung <b>at</b> a height of <b>less than three</b> handbreadths, <b>and</b> consequently <b>the reason</b> he is liable <b>is that he intended to acquire it, but</b> if <b>he does not intend to acquire it</b> he is <b>not</b> liable? <b>Let him interpret</b> the mishna as referring to a case where he turned over the dung at a height <b>above three</b> handbreadths, in which case <b>even if he did not intend to acquire it, he is liable.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> What forced him was that <b>the mishna was difficult for him. Why</b> does it state <b>specifically</b> that <b>he turned over</b> the dung? <b>Let it teach</b> that <b>he lifted</b> the dung. <b>Rather, learn from</b> the fact that the mishna does not use the term: Lifted, which generally is referring to the act of lifting an object three handbreadths for the purpose of acquisition, that <b>whenever</b> the term <b>turned over</b> is used, it is referring to an act in which the object is lifted to a height of <b>under three</b> handbreadths from the ground.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Elazar</b> was evidently the one who <b>said</b> that one who renounces ownership of his hazardous object in the public domain is still <b>liable</b> to pay for any damage it causes, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is clearly the one who <b>said</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that if one renounces ownership of his object he is exempt from liability for any damage it causes? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (30a): With regard to <b>one who conceals a thorn or</b> a piece of <b>glass, or who puts up a fence of thorns, or</b> who puts up <b>a fence that</b> subsequently <b>fell into the public domain, and another</b> person <b>incurred damage due to</b> any of <b>these,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for</b> this person’s <b>damage.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to one who puts up a fence of thorns, <b>they taught</b> that he is liable <b>only in</b> a case where he <b>projects</b> the thorns out into the public domain, <b>but in</b> a case where he <b>restricts</b> them to his own property, he is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara infers: In a case where he <b>restricts</b> them, <b>what is the reason</b> that he is <b>exempt? Is it not because it is</b> considered <b>a pit on his</b> own <b>property? By inference, the liability</b> in the category <b>of Pit,</b> according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>is in the public domain,</b> where a pit generally does not belong to the one who dug it. <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that <b>one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property is liable.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>No, actually I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that in principle, <b>one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property is exempt.</b> Nevertheless, one who puts up a fence of thorns is liable, because he does not renounce ownership of the thorns that protrude into the public domain. <b>And</b> in a case where <b>he restricts</b> the thorns to his own property, <b>what is the reason</b> he is <b>exempt?</b> The reason is not that he is not liable to pay for the damage of a pit in his own property, but rather <b>because it was stated about</b> this case that <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said:</b> He is exempt <b>because it is not the</b> typical <b>manner of people to rub against walls,</b> but to keep a small distance from them. Therefore, if a pedestrian is injured by the thorns, it is considered an unusual accident, for which the owner of the fence is not liable.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say that</b> one who renounces ownership of his hazardous objects is exempt? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that in general, <b>the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with an unattributed mishna, and we learned</b> in an unattributed mishna (50b): In the case of <b>one who digs a pit in the public domain and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> This mishna is referring to one who digs a pit in the public domain, where it is not owned by the one who dug it, yet the mishna deems him liable.
The Gemara concludes: <b>Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is <b>actually</b> the one who <b>said</b> that one who renounces ownership of his hazardous objects is <b>liable.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that he is <b>liable,</b> is it evident that <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> that he is <b>exempt? But doesn’t Rabbi Elazar say</b>

Daf 30a

<b>in the name of Rabbi Yishmael</b> that one is liable to pay for damage caused by a pit that he dug in the public domain, even if it is not his personal property?
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> ruling, that he is exempt, <b>is his own</b> opinion, whereas <b>that</b> ruling, that he is liable, <b>is</b> the opinion <b>of his teacher</b> Rabbi Yishmael, and he disagrees with it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who pours water in the public domain, and another</b> person <b>in-curred damage due to it,</b> the one who poured water <b>is liable</b> to pay <b>for his damage.</b> In the case of <b>one who conceals a thorn or a piece of glass</b> in his wall adjacent to the public domain, <b>or one who puts up a fence of thorns, or</b> one who puts up <b>a fence that</b> subsequently <b>fell into the public domain, and others incurred damage due to</b> any of <b>these, he is liable</b> to pay <b>for their damage.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the case of one who pours water in the public domain, <b>Rav says: They taught</b> that he is liable <b>only when the clothes</b> of one who slipped <b>were soiled by the</b> dirty <b>water, but</b> if the one who slipped <b>himself</b> was injured, the one who poured the water <b>is exempt,</b> as it is the impact with <b>the ground</b> that <b>injured him,</b> not the water.
<b>Rav Huna said to Rav:</b> Why should he be exempt from paying restitution for the injury? Even if the water that he poured is considered <b>only like his filth</b> that he tossed in the public domain, he should be liable. Since the muddy ground caused the injury, and the mud belongs to him, as it results from the addition of his water to the dirt, he should be liable.
Rav responded: <b>Do you maintain</b> that this is a case <b>where the water was not absorbed</b> into the ground? It is a case <b>where the water was absorbed,</b> leaving only moist dirt. Since there is no mud there that can be deemed as belonging to the one who spilled the water, he is exempt from liability.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the mishna’s ruling refers only to the soiling of the pedestrian’s clothes, <b>why do I</b> need <b>two</b> <i>mishnayot</i> to state this <i>halakha</i>? According to Rav, this <i>halakha</i> was already addressed in the previous mishna, with regard to a jug that broke, causing a pedestrian to fall and his clothes to become soiled.
The Gemara answers: <b>One</b> <i>halakha</i> was stated with regard to a case where this occurred <b>in the summer,</b> the dry season, <b>and one</b> with regard to a case where it occurred <b>in the rainy season.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all those</b> people <b>who</b> engage in activities that the Sages <b>stated</b> are permitted, i.e., those who <b>open [<i>potkin</i>] their gutters</b> and drain the sewage from their houses into the public domain, <b>and</b> those who <b>flush out</b> the water from <b>their caves,</b> where foul-smelling water was stored, into the public domain, <b>during the summer they do not have permission</b> to do so, while <b>during the rainy season they have permission</b> to do so, since the street is rained upon in any event and thereby washed. <b>And although</b> all these people perform their actions <b>with permission, if they cause damage they are liable to pay</b> for it. Because of the difference between the summer and the rainy season with regard to whether it is permitted for one to pour water into the public domain, both <i>mishnayot</i> are necessary, one for each season. This is in order to teach that even in the rainy season, when it is permitted to pour water into the public domain, one is nevertheless liable to pay for damage resulting from the water.
§ It is stated in the mishna that <b>one who conceals a thorn</b> or a piece of glass, or one who puts up a fence of thorns, is liable to pay for damage resulting from them. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> that he is liable <b>only</b> in a case where he <b>projects</b> these obstacles into the public domain, <b>but</b> if he <b>restricts</b> them to his own property, he is <b>not</b> liable. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>he is exempt? Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, says:</b> It is <b>because it is not the</b> typical <b>manner of people to rub against walls,</b> but to keep a certain distance from them. Therefore, if a pedestrian is wounded by the thorns, it is considered an unusual accident, for which the owner of the fence is not liable.
<b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:6): With regard to <b>one who conceals his thorns or his pieces of glass in another’s wall, and the owner of the wall came and demolished his wall and it fell into the public domain,</b> and the thorns or glass <b>caused damage, the one who concealed them is liable.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> this <b>only in</b> the case of <b>an unstable wall,</b> since the one who concealed his items should have anticipated that the owner of the wall would soon demolish it, <b>but in</b> the case of <b>a stable wall, the one who concealed</b> his items <b>is exempt, and the owner of the wall is liable.</b>
<b>Ravina says: That is to say</b> that in the case of <b>one who covers his pit with another’s bucket, and the owner of the bucket came and took his bucket,</b> and the pit causes damage, <b>the owner of the pit is liable.</b>
The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> This is exactly the same <i>halakha</i> as Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement with regard to one who conceals thorns in an unstable wall, i.e., that the hazardous item was likely to be revealed from the moment that it was concealed, and therefore its owner is liable to pay for any damage that it causes. What is the novel element in Ravina’s statement?
The Gemara answers: It is necessary. <b>Lest you say:</b> It is only <b>there,</b> in the case of the thorns, that the owner of the wall is exempt, <b>since he did not know</b> who concealed the hazardous item in order <b>to inform him</b> that he should remove them, <b>but here, since</b> the owner of the bucket <b>knew</b> who dug the pit, <b>he should have informed him</b> that he was taking his bucket and is consequently liable to pay for damage caused by the pit, Ravina therefore, <b>teaches us</b> that he is not required to inform the owner of the pit, and he bears no responsibility for any damage caused.
<b>The Sages taught: The early pious people would conceal their thorns and their pieces of glass in their fields, and would dig to the depth of</b> at least <b>three handbreadths</b> in order to bury them, <b>so that they would not obstruct the plow.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Sheshet would toss</b> his thorns <b>into fire,</b> so they would not cause damage to others. <b>Rava would toss them into the Tigris [<i>Diglat</i>]</b> River.
<b>Rav Yehuda says: One who wants to be pious should observe the matters of</b> tractate <b><i>Nezikin</i>,</b> so as to avoid causing damage to others. <b>Rava said</b> he should observe <b>the matters of</b> tractate <b><i>Avot</i>. And some say</b> he should observe <b>the matters of</b> tractate <b><i>Berakhot</i>.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who takes out his straw [<i>teven</i>] and his hay [<i>kash</i>] to the public domain to</b> use afterward as <b>fertilizer and another</b> person <b>incurred damage due to them,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for his damage, and whoever</b> takes possession of the hay and straw <b>first acquires</b> them for himself. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who places obstacles in the public domain and they cause damage,</b> he is <b>liable to pay</b> damages, <b>and whoever</b> takes possession <b>of them first acquires</b> them.
In the case of <b>one who turns over dung in the public domain and another</b> person <b>incurred damage due to it,</b> the former <b>is liable</b> to pay <b>for his damage.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Let us say</b> that the ruling in <b>the mishna</b> that one is liable to pay for damage caused by straw or hay that he put in the public domain <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: During the period when fertilizer is taken out, a person may take his fertilizer out to the public domain and let it accumulate</b> there <b>for a full thirty days, so that it gets trampled by people’s feet and by animals’ feet, as</b> it was <b>on this condition</b> that <b>Joshua bequeathed Eretz</b> Yisrael to the Jewish people (see 80b). In other words, people do not have the right to prevent someone from taking out his straw to the public domain, since they received their portion of Eretz Yisrael following Joshua’s conquest on this condition. Apparently, since one has the right to take out his straw, he is not held liable to pay for damage caused by it.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> since <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> possibly <b>concedes that if</b> the fertilizer <b>caused damage,</b> he is liable to <b>pay for the damage it caused,</b> although he acted within his rights.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If a pile of straw on the back of an animal that was passing through the public domain catches fire <b>from a Hanukkah lamp</b> that was placed outside a store, the owner of the lamp is <b>exempt, since he</b> put it there <b>with permission</b> (see 62b)? <b>What, is it not because</b> he put it there with the <b>permission of the court</b> and is therefore exempt from paying for damage caused by it?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>because</b> he put it there with the <b>permission</b> granted to those performing <b>a mitzva.</b> Permission of the court is not sufficient to exempt him from paying damages, unless, in addition, permission was granted for the purpose of performing a mitzva. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that if it caught fire <b>from a Hanukkah lamp</b> he is <b>exempt because</b> he had <b>permission</b> to put it there in order to perform <b>a mitzva.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an alternative proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>all these</b> cases in <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>it is permitted</b> for people <b>to place obstacles in the public domain, if they caused damage,</b> these people <b>are liable to pay, and Rabbi Yehuda exempts</b> them. Evidently, according to Rabbi Yehuda, if one has the permission of the court to put an item in the public domain, he is exempt from paying damages.
<b>Rav Naḥman said: The mishna</b> is referring to a case where one put his fertilizer outside <b>not during the period when fertilizer is taken out.</b> Therefore, he did not have permission to do so. <b>And it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that one is liable only if he acts without permission.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> an alternative explanation of the mishna according to Rabbi Yehuda:

Daf 30b

What <b>we learned</b> in the mishna was specifically with regard to a case where one put out <b>his straw and his hay,</b> which are more likely to cause injury than fertilizer and other objects, <b>because they are</b> particularly <b>slippery.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yehuda agrees that in this case he is liable to pay for damage they cause.
§ It is stated in the mishna that if one puts his straw and hay out in the public domain, <b>whoever</b> takes possession <b>of them first acquires</b> them. The Sages disagreed with regard to the extent of this acquisition. <b>Rav says:</b> He acquires them <b>both with regard to</b> the items <b>themselves and with regard to</b> the value of <b>their enhancement,</b> which took place while they were in the public domain. <b>And Ze’eiri says:</b> He acquires them <b>with regard to</b> the value of <b>their enhancement but not with regard to</b> the items <b>themselves,</b> and he must pay the owner of the straw according to their value at the time he placed them in the public domain.
<b>With regard to what do they disagree? Rav holds</b> that the Sages <b>penalized</b> the owner by revoking his ownership of the items <b>themselves due to</b> the value of <b>their enhancement</b> that he stands to earn by putting them in the public domain, <b>whereas Ze’eiri holds</b> that <b>they did not penalize</b> him by revoking his ownership of the items <b>themselves due to</b> the value of <b>their enhancement.</b> Rather, he loses only the increase in their value due to their enhancement.
The Gemara attempts to prove that Ze’eiri’s opinion is correct from a case where there is no enhancement at all. <b>We learned</b> in the continuation of the mishna that in the case of <b>one who turns over dung in the public domain and another</b> person <b>incurred damage due to it,</b> the former is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for his damage. But it does not teach</b> in this clause that <b>whoever</b> takes possession of it <b>first acquires</b> it. Apparently the Sages did not revoke his ownership of the dung, as it has no enhanced value. This does not seem to accord with Rav’s opinion.
The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> that whoever takes possession of it acquires it <b>is taught in the first clause,</b> with regard to one who puts out straw, <b>and the same is true in the last clause,</b> with regard to one who turns over dung. It is unnecessary to repeat it. Therefore, no support for the opinion of Ze’eiri can be derived from here.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in that regard,</b> i.e., a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the same cases as the mishna, that the hay and straw <b>are forbidden due to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery,</b> which apparently means that one may not take possession of the dung, contrary to Rav’s opinion?
The Gemara answers: <b>When it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>they are forbidden due to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery, it applies to the entire mishna,</b> not just to this particular clause, and it is referring <b>to</b> taking the items from <b>the one who came first and acquired</b> them. In other words, once someone takes possession of them, it is forbidden for anyone else to take them from him, as that is considered robbery.
The Gemara asks: <b>But it is not taught in this manner</b> elsewhere, <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who takes out his straw and his hay to the public domain to</b> use afterward as <b>fertilizer and another</b> person <b>incurred damage due to them, he is liable</b> to pay <b>for his damage. And</b> furthermore, <b>whoever</b> takes possession <b>of them first acquires</b> them, <b>and is permitted</b> to do so <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery. And</b> in the case of <b>one who turns over dung in the public domain and another incurred damage due to it,</b> he <b>is liable, but it is forbidden</b> to take possession of it <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Is it from the case of <b>dung</b> that <b>you raise a contradiction</b> to Rav’s opinion that one may take possession of straw and hay in the public domain? With regard to <b>an item that has</b> added value due to <b>enhancement</b> over time as a result of lying in the public domain, Rav holds that the Sages <b>penalized</b> one who leaves it in the public domain, revoking his ownership of the item <b>itself because of its</b> added value due to <b>enhancement,</b> but with regard to <b>an item that does not have</b> added value due to <b>enhancement</b> by lying in the public domain, such as dung, perhaps Rav concedes that <b>they did not penalize</b> him in this manner.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>According to the statement of</b> Rav, <b>who says that they penalized</b> him by revoking his ownership of <b>the items themselves because of its</b> added value due to <b>enhancement, do we impose</b> this <b>penalty immediately</b> when he takes the straw out, allowing one to take possession of it even before it has time for its value to become enhanced, <b>or do we impose the penalty</b> only <b>when its enhancement</b> in value <b>emerges?</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that the penalty is imposed immediately <b>from</b> the fact <b>that we spoke of</b> a difficulty to Rav’s opinion from the case of <b>dung,</b> whose value does not become enhanced, indicating that according to Rav the penalty is imposed before there is any enhancement.
The Gemara responds: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> this proof? <b>When we spoke</b> of <b>dung,</b> this was <b>before Rav Naḥman</b> bar Yitzḥak <b>resolved</b> the difficulty, explaining that perhaps Rav concedes that there is no penalty in this case. But <b>after Rav Naḥman resolved</b> it, <b>is it at all possible to raise an objection</b> to Rav’s opinion from the case of <b>dung?</b> Therefore, no proof can be brought from there.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this dispute is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is stated in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a document in which</b> a loan with <b>interest is written, we penalize</b> the lender, <b>and he</b> therefore <b>collects neither the principal nor the interest;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: He collects the principal but not the interest. Shall we say</b> that <b>Rav stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> whose penalty applies to the value of the loan itself due to its enhancement, i.e., the interest, which is prohibited, <b>and</b> that <b>Ze’eiri stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who impose the penalty only on the interest?
The Gemara answers that <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: I stated</b> my opinion <b>even</b> according <b>to the</b> opinion of the <b>Rabbis. The Rabbis were saying there</b> that the principal is not forfeited by the lender <b>only because the principal</b> was loaned <b>in a permissible</b> manner, as the prohibition applies only to the interest. <b>But here,</b> in the case of one who put his straw in the public domain, <b>the principal,</b> i.e., the hazardous object <b>itself, causes damage.</b> Therefore, the penalty should relate to the object itself.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>Ze’eiri</b> could have <b>said to you: I stated</b> my opinion <b>even</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> The reason <b>Rabbi Meir was saying there,</b> in the case of a loan with interest, that the principal is also forfeited is <b>only that</b> the prohibition was already violated <b>from the time of the writing</b> of the document, <b>by making an appraisal [<i>shuma</i>]</b> of how much money is to be repaid, which included interest. <b>But here,</b> in the case of straw that one placed in the public domain, <b>who can say that it will cause damage?</b> Since the damage was not inevitable at the time that the straw was placed there, there is no justification for revoking the ownership of the straw itself.
The Gemara suggests alternatively: <b>Let us say</b> that the dispute between Rav and Ze’eiri is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is stated in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who takes his straw and his hay out to the public domain to</b> use afterward as <b>fertilizer, and another incurred damage due to them,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for his damage. And whoever</b> takes possession <b>of them first acquires</b> them, <b>but they are forbidden due to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> In the case of <b>anyone who places obstacles in the public domain and they cause damage,</b> he is <b>liable to pay. And whoever</b> takes possession of <b>them first acquires</b> them <b>and they are permitted</b> to him <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>This matter itself is difficult.</b> First <b>you said</b> that <b>whoever</b> takes possession <b>of them first acquires</b> them, <b>and then it says that they are forbidden due to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery,</b> indicating that one may not take possession of them. <b>Rather, is this not what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> This statement: <b>And whoever</b> takes possession <b>of them first acquires</b> them, is stated <b>with regard to</b> the value of <b>their enhancement.</b> And this statement: <b>But they are forbidden due to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery,</b> is stated <b>with regard to</b> the items <b>themselves? And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel came to say</b> that <b>even</b> with regard to the items <b>themselves, whoever</b> takes possession <b>of them first acquires</b> them. Therefore, this tannaitic dispute apparently relates to whether the penalty applies to the items themselves or just to the value of their enhancement.
The Gemara comments: <b>According to Ze’eiri, it is certainly</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> since Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel explicitly deems it permitted for one to take possession of the items. According <b>to Rav, shall we say</b> that <b>it is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b>
The Gemara responds that <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you:</b> According <b>to all</b> opinions, the Sages <b>imposed a penalty</b> revoking his ownership of the items <b>themselves due to</b> the value of <b>their enhancement. And here</b> in the <i>baraita</i> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether or not it is ruled that this is the <b><i>halakha</i> but</b> a public <b>ruling is not issued to that effect, as it was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagreed as to whether the <i>halakha</i> revoking his ownership of the items themselves should be taught to the public. <b>Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b> This is the <b><i>halakha</i>, but</b> a public <b>ruling is not issued to that effect.</b> In other words, although it is permitted for one to take possession of the straw, halakhic authorities should not publicly rule that people may do so, lest people become accustomed to taking items that belong to others. This is the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> This is the <b><i>halakha</i> and</b> a public <b>ruling is issued to that effect.</b> This, Rav could have said, is the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rav Huna declare dried barley [<i>ḥushelei</i>]</b> that people laid out in the public domain <b>ownerless?</b> Similarly, didn’t <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava declare ownerless</b>

Daf 31a

<b>residue from dates?</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> acted <b>in accordance with his halakhic</b> opinion that this is the <i>halakha</i>, and a public ruling is issued to that effect. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>Rav Huna, shall we say</b> that <b>he retracted</b> his prior opinion?
The Gemara answers: <b>Those</b> owners of the barley <b>were forewarned</b> to remove the barley from the public domain, and they did not comply. Therefore, they were penalized by Rav Huna declaring publicly that their barley was ownerless.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>two potters</b> carrying pots <b>who were walking one after the other</b> in the public domain, <b>and the first stumbled</b> on a bump <b>and fell, and the second stumbled over the first</b> and fell too, <b>the first</b> is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for the damage incurred by the second.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Do not say that the mishna is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>one who stumbles is</b> considered <b>negligent and</b> therefore <b>liable. Rather, even</b> according <b>to the Rabbis, who say</b> that one who stumbles <b>is</b> generally <b>a victim of circumstances beyond his control and is</b> consequently <b>exempt, here,</b> in the case in the mishna, he is <b>liable, since</b> after falling <b>he had</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, <b>and he did not stand</b> up.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that <b>he did not have</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, <b>he had</b> the opportunity <b>to warn</b> the person behind him, <b>and he did not warn</b> him.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said</b> in response that <b>since he did not have</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, <b>he did not have</b> the opportunity <b>to warn</b> the other person either, <b>as he was busy</b> trying to stand up. Therefore, the mishna, which holds him liable, must be referring to a case where he could have stood up.
The Gemara attempts to prove that the opinion of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak is correct. <b>We learned</b> in the next mishna (31b): If <b>the owner of</b> a cross <b>beam was</b> walking in the public domain carrying his beam <b>first, and the owner of a barrel was</b> walking with his barrel <b>last,</b> i.e., behind him, and <b>the barrel was broken by the</b> cross <b>beam,</b> the one who carried the cross beam is <b>exempt. But if the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam stopped,</b> he is <b>liable,</b> since the accident was caused by his stopping.
The Gemara asks: <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a situation <b>where</b> the one carrying the cross beam <b>stopped</b> in order <b>to adjust</b> the load <b>on his shoulder, which is the normative behavior of</b> one carrying a beam, and is not considered negligence? <b>And</b> nevertheless the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that he is <b>liable,</b> as, although <b>he had</b> the opportunity <b>to warn</b> the person behind him that he was about to stop, he did not warn him. This supports the opinion of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak.
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is referring to a situation <b>where he stopped to rest,</b> which could not have been anticipated by the person walking behind him. Consequently, he is liable.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this interpretation, if <b>he stop-ped to adjust</b> the load <b>on his shoulder, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is he <b>exempt?</b> If so, <b>rather than teaching</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of that mishna: <b>But if he said to the owner of the barrel: Stop,</b> he is <b>exempt, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>distinguish and teach within</b> the former case <b>itself,</b> as follows: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that he is liable, <b>said?</b> In a case <b>when he stopped to rest. But</b> in a case where <b>he stopped to adjust</b> the load <b>on his shoulder,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara answers: The mishna is presented in <b>this</b> manner because it <b>teaches us this</b> novelty, <b>that even if he stopped to rest,</b> in a case <b>when he says to the owner of the barrel: Stop,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an alternative proof from what is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>potters and glaziers who were walking one after the other,</b> and <b>the first stumbled and fell, and the second stumbled over the first,</b> sustaining damage, <b>and the third</b> stumbled <b>over the second,</b> also falling and sustaining damage, in this case, <b>the first</b> person is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for the damage of the second, and the second</b> is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for the damage of the third. But if they</b> all <b>fell because of the first, the first</b> is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for the damage of them all. And if they warned each other,</b> i.e., each one warned the next, <b>they are</b> all <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>What, is it not</b> a case <b>where they did not have</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, and they are nevertheless liable to pay for not warning the people behind them, in accordance with the opinion of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is a case <b>where they had</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up and they did not do so.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this interpretation, if <b>they did not have</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, <b>what</b> would be the <i>halakha</i>? Would they be <b>exempt? If so, rather than teaching</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>If they warned one another, they are exempt, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>distinguish and teach within</b> the former case <b>itself,</b> as follows: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that they are liable, <b>said?</b> It is a case <b>where they had</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, <b>but</b> if <b>they did not have</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, <b>they are exempt.</b>
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is presented in <b>this</b> manner because it <b>teaches us this</b> novelty, <b>that even if they had</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up, in a case <b>when they warned each other they are exempt.</b>
§ With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>Rava said: The first</b> one who stumbled is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for the damage of the second, both for damage caused</b> to the second person <b>by his body and for damage caused</b> to him <b>by his property.</b> By contrast, <b>the second</b> is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for the damage of the third</b> only <b>with regard to damage caused by his body</b> as result of the fall, <b>and not with regard to damage caused by his property.</b>
The Gemara questions Rava’s statement: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, this is difficult to understand. <b>If</b> Rava maintains that <b>one who stumbles is</b> considered <b>negligent, the second</b> person <b>should also be liable</b> to pay for all forms of damage caused by his negligence. And <b>if</b> Rava maintains that <b>one who stumbles is not</b> considered <b>negligent, even the first should be exempt</b> from liability for the damage incurred by the second.

Daf 31b

The Gemara explains: <b>The first is certainly</b> considered <b>negligent,</b> and is therefore liable to pay for damage caused by both his body and his property. <b>The second is deemed liable</b> to pay <b>for</b> damage caused by <b>his body, as he had</b> the opportunity <b>to stand</b> up <b>and he did not stand</b> up. <b>For</b> damage caused by <b>his property</b> that was lying there and that caused the third person to stumble and fall, he is <b>exempt, as he can say to him: I did not dig this pit,</b> i.e., I did not cause this obstacle. Since it was the first person who stumbled and brought about the situation where the items of the second were lying on the ground, the second is not deemed liable.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rava’s statement from a <i>baraita</i> that comments on this case: <b>All of them are liable</b> to pay <b>for damage caused by their bodies and exempt</b> from paying restitution <b>for damage caused by their property. What, does this not</b> refer <b>even</b> to <b>the first,</b> indicating that even he is exempt from damage caused by his property?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring to all of them <b>except for the first.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> the term <b>all of them,</b> indicating that the first is also included? <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said:</b> The term <b>all of them</b> refers only to <b>those who incurred damage,</b> and excludes the first one, who only caused damage to others.
The Gemara questions this answer: <b>What</b> is <b>this</b> interpretation? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the term includes <b>even the first, this</b> explanation <b>is</b> consistent with <b>that which is taught: All of them. But if you say</b> that it is referring to all of them <b>except for the first, what is</b> the reason that the misleading term: <b>All of them</b> is used? <b>Let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> more accurately that <b>those who incurred damage</b> are liable in turn for the damage caused by their bodies, but are exempt from paying restitution for damage caused by their property.
<b>Rather,</b> this entire explanation of Rava’s statement should be rejected, and it should be explained as follows: <b>Rava said</b> that <b>the first</b> is <b>liable both for injury</b> caused <b>to the body of the second and for damage</b> caused <b>to the property of the second, and the second</b> is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for damage incurred by the third with regard to injury to his body but not with regard to damage to his property. What is the reason</b> for the exemption in the last case? It is <b>because</b> after his fall, the body of the second person <b>is</b> effectively <b>a pit, and we do not find that</b> in the category of <b>Pit</b> one is <b>liable</b> to pay restitution <b>for</b> damage caused to <b>vessels.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well</b> according <b>to Shmuel, who says</b> that <b>any obstacle</b> that was placed in the public domain <b>constitutes a pit,</b> i.e., the <i>halakhot</i> of a pit apply to it. <b>But</b> according <b>to Rav, who says</b> that <b>if</b> the one who placed it there <b>renounces ownership</b> of the hazardous object it <b>is</b> considered a pit, <b>but if</b> he does <b>not</b> renounce ownership of it then it is <b>not</b> considered a pit, <b>what is there to say?</b> The second one who fell obviously did not renounce ownership of his body, so why is he exempt from damage he caused to vessels as though he were a pit?
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> Rava’s statement should be explained <b>as</b> he was understood to have <b>said initially,</b> i.e., that he distinguishes between damage caused by another’s body and damage caused by his property. <b>And as for your difficulty</b> from the statement in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>all of them are liable</b> to pay for the damage caused by their bodies but exempt from paying restitution for the damage caused by their property, apparently including even the first one, contrary to Rava’s opinion, <b>Rav Adda bar Minyumi interpreted it before Ravina</b> as referring to a case <b>where vessels were damaged by vessels.</b> In other words, it is not the body, but the vessels of the second that were damaged by the property of the first, and since the broken vessels of the first have the status of a pit, the owner is exempt from liability for damage caused to the vessels of others.
<b>The Master said</b> above: <b>If they</b> all <b>fell because of the first, the first</b> is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for the damage of them all.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How did they</b> all <b>fall because of the first? Rav Pappa said:</b> It is a case <b>where he blocked the road like a skeleton [<i>keshilda</i>],</b> filling the entire width of the road and causing the rest to stumble over different parts of his body. <b>Rav Zevid said:</b> He fell diagonally <b>like a blind man’s cane,</b> and they all stumbled over him.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>this</b> person <b>came</b> in the public domain <b>with his barrel, and that</b> person <b>came</b> from the opposite direction <b>with his</b> cross <b>beam,</b> and <b>this one’s jug was broken by that one’s</b> cross <b>beam,</b> the one carrying the cross beam is <b>exempt, because this one had permission to walk</b> in the public domain, <b>and that one</b> also <b>had permission to walk</b> there.
If they were walking in the same direction, so that <b>the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam was</b> walking <b>first,</b> in front, <b>and the owner of a barrel last,</b> behind him, and <b>the barrel was broken by the</b> cross <b>beam, the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam</b> is <b>exempt,</b> since the owner of the barrel saw him in front of him and should have been more careful.

Daf 32a

<b>But if the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam stopped,</b> causing the barrel to collide with the beam and break, the former is <b>liable,</b> since the latter had no way of anticipating that he would stop. <b>And if he said to the owner of the barrel: Stop,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability for breaking the barrel.
Conversely, if <b>the owner of the barrel was</b> walking <b>first and the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam last,</b> and <b>the barrel was broken by the</b> cross <b>beam,</b> the owner of the cross beam is <b>liable. But if owner of the barrel stopped,</b> the owner of the cross beam is <b>exempt</b> from liability for breaking the barrel. <b>And if he said to the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam: Stop,</b> the owner of the cross beam is <b>liable. And similarly,</b> these <i>halakhot</i> apply in a case where <b>this one came with his lamp and that one came with his flax,</b> and the lamp set fire to the flax.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabba bar Natan asked Rav Huna:</b> With regard to <b>one who causes injury to his wife during sexual intercourse, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he liable to pay damages? Is it reasoned that <b>since he is acting in a permitted manner</b> he is <b>exempt, or perhaps he should pay attention</b> and be more careful?
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rabba bar Natan: <b>You learned this</b> <i>halakha</i> in the mishna concerning one person walking with a cross beam and another with a barrel, which rules that the owner of the cross beam is exempt <b>because this one had permission to walk and that one</b> also <b>had permission to walk.</b> Similarly, since the husband has permission to engage in intercourse with his wife, if he injures her in the process he is exempt.
<b>Rava</b> disagreed with Rav Huna’s opinion and <b>said:</b> The husband is liable due to an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference from the <i>halakha</i> with regard to manslaughter, as it is stated in the Torah: “As when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood…and the head slips off the helve, and finds his neighbor, and he dies; he shall flee to one of these cities and live” (Deuteronomy 19:5). <b>And just as</b> in the <b>forest, where this</b> person <b>entered his domain and that</b> person <b>entered his domain,</b> as it is the domain of the public, and nevertheless the one who kills unintentionally is <b>considered like one who entered another’s domain and</b> is therefore <b>liable</b> to be exiled to a city of refuge, then with regard to <b>this</b> husband, <b>who</b> actually <b>enters another’s domain, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that he should be liable for the injury he causes her?
The Gemara raises an objection to Rava’s opinion: <b>But</b> what of <b>this</b> mishna, <b>which teaches</b> that the owner of the cross beam is exempt, as <b>this one had permission to walk and that one had permission to walk,</b> and Rav Huna inferred from here that the husband is likewise exempt.
The Gemara answers: The two cases are different. <b>There,</b> in the case in the mishna, <b>both</b> sides <b>were similarly</b> walking, and the one who caused the damage is therefore exempt due to his right to walk there. By contrast, <b>here,</b> the husband is the only active participant in the intercourse. Therefore, since <b>he is</b> the one <b>performing an action,</b> he is liable even though he is acting with permission.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is she not</b> considered an active participant? <b>But isn’t it written</b> with regard to forbidden sexual intercourse: <b>“Even the souls that do them shall be cut off from among their people”</b> (Leviticus 18:29), indicating that both the man and woman are considered to be performing an action?
The Gemara answers: The verse is referring to the fact that <b>they both have pleasure</b> from the act. The woman’s pleasure is tantamount to active transgression, and she is therefore punished if she participates willfully. But with regard to a wife’s injury, <b>he is</b> the one who is considered to be <b>performing an action,</b> and he is therefore liable.
§ The mishna teaches: In a case where <b>the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam was</b> walking <b>first</b> and the owner of the barrel was walking behind him, if the barrel was broken by the cross beam, the owner of the cross beam is exempt. <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> If <b>two cows</b> were <b>in the public domain, one</b> of them <b>prone and one walking,</b> and the cow that was <b>walking kicked the</b> cow that was <b>prone,</b> its owner is <b>exempt.</b> If the <b>prone</b> cow <b>kicked</b> the cow that was <b>walking,</b> its owner is <b>liable</b> to pay.
<b>Let us say that</b> the mishna <b>supports</b> this statement, as it states: If <b>the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam was first and the owner of the barrel was last,</b> and <b>the barrel was broken by the</b> cross <b>beam, he is exempt. But if the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam stopped,</b> the owner of the cross beam is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara explains the proof: <b>But here,</b> it is clear <b>that</b> it is <b>like</b> a case where the <b>prone</b> cow kicked the cow that was <b>walking,</b> since the one carrying the barrel was walking and the one carrying the cross beam stopped in the public domain, causing damage to the former. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in this case that the owner of the cross beam <b>is liable.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> that reasoning? <b>You wanted to support</b> the statement of Reish Lakish from the mishna. <b>Not only does it not support</b> Reish Lakish; <b>it even raises a difficulty</b> to his opinion. <b>The reason</b> Reish Lakish stated that the owner of the prone cow is liable is <b>that it kicked</b> the walking cow; <b>but</b> if the walking cow <b>was damaged</b> because <b>by itself</b> it collided with the prone cow, he would be <b>exempt. But the mishna</b> discusses a case <b>where</b> the one carrying the barrel ran into the cross beam <b>by himself,</b> without the one carrying the cross beam actively hitting it, <b>and it teaches</b> that the owner of the cross beam is nevertheless <b>liable.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>The mishna</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the cross beam <b>blocked the</b> entire width of the <b>road like a carcass.</b> Since the one carrying the barrel could not avoid it, the one carrying the cross beam is liable although he did not actively break the barrel. By contrast, <b>here,</b> Reish Lakish’s statement is referring to a case <b>where</b> the cow <b>was lying down on one side</b> of the public domain, and the other cow <b>should have walked on the other,</b> unobstructed <b>side.</b> Therefore, if the damage is caused only as a result of their collision, the owner of the prone cow is exempt.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>the latter clause of the mishna</b> that <b>supports Reish Lakish’s</b> statement, <b>as it teaches:</b> Conversely, <b>if the owner of the barrel was</b> walking <b>first and the owner of the</b> cross <b>beam last,</b> and <b>the barrel was broken by the</b> cross <b>beam,</b> the owner of the cross beam is <b>liable. But if the owner of the barrel stopped,</b> the owner of the cross beam is <b>exempt</b> from liability for breaking the barrel. <b>But here,</b> it is clear <b>that</b> it is <b>like</b> a case where <b>the walking</b> cow kicked <b>the prone</b> cow. <b>And</b> the mishna <b>teaches that</b> the owner of the cross beam is <b>exempt,</b> lending support to Reish Lakish’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>The mishna</b> exempts the one carrying the cross beam <b>because he was walking in his normal manner</b> when he hit the barrel. <b>Here,</b> perhaps the owner of the prone cow <b>can say to</b> the owner of the walking cow: <b>Although you have permission to walk over me,</b> i.e., for your cow to walk over my cow, <b>you have no permission to kick me,</b> i.e., for your cow to kick my cow.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>two</b> people <b>who were walking in the public domain,</b> or <b>one</b> who was <b>running and</b> another <b>one</b> who was <b>walking, or who were both running, and they damaged one another, both of them are exempt.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Isi ben Yehuda. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Isi ben Yehuda says</b> that one who <b>runs</b> in the public domain and causes damage <b>is liable</b> to pay for any damage he causes <b>because</b> his behavior <b>is unusual</b> in the public domain. <b>And Isi concedes</b> with regard to one who runs and causes damage at <b>twilight on the eve of Shabbat that he is exempt, because he is running with permission.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Isi ben Yehuda.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that if one runs and causes damage he is liable? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say,</b> as a principle, that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with an unattributed mishna? And we learned</b> in this mishna that if <b>one was running and</b> the other <b>one was walking, or</b> if <b>they were both running, they are exempt.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>The mishna,</b> which exempts one who was running, is referring <b>to twilight on the eve of Shabbat,</b> when people are permitted to run in the public domain.
The Gemara explains: <b>From where</b> is it inferred that the mishna is referring to twilight on the eve of Shabbat? It is inferred <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches: Or who were both running, they are exempt. Why do I need this</b> case <b>as well? Now</b> that the mishna teaches that if <b>one was running and</b> the other <b>one was walking,</b> the one running is <b>exempt, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that he is exempt when <b>both of them were running? Rather, this is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> If <b>one was running and</b> the other <b>one was walking,</b> he is <b>exempt. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to twilight on the eve of Shabbat,</b> when running in the public domain is permitted. <b>But on a weekday,</b> if <b>one was running and</b> the other <b>one was walking,</b> the one who was running is <b>liable.</b> If <b>both were running, even on a weekday, they are exempt.</b> This emendation explains the need to mention the case where both were running.
<b>The Master said</b> above: <b>And Isi concedes</b> with regard to one who runs and causes damage at <b>twilight on the eve of Shabbat that he is exempt, because he is running with permission.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the reason that running at twilight <b>on the eve of Shabbat</b> is considered to be <b>with permission?</b>
The Gemara answers: It is <b>like</b> that <b>which Rabbi Ḥanina</b> would say, <b>as Rabbi Ḥanina would say</b> at twilight on the eve of Shabbat:

Daf 32b

<b>Come and let us go out to greet the bride, the queen. And some say</b> that this is what he would say: Come and let us go out <b>to greet Shabbat, the bride, the queen. Rabbi Yannai would wrap himself</b> in his <i>tallit</i> <b>and stand</b> at the eve of Shabbat at twilight, <b>saying: Come, bride; come, bride.</b> Similarly, it is appropriate for one to run out in honor of Shabbat.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who was chopping</b> wood <b>in the public domain and</b> a chip flew off and <b>caused damage in</b> the <b>private property</b> of another person, or one who was chopping wood <b>in</b> his <b>private property and caused damage in the public domain,</b> or one who was chopping wood <b>in</b> his <b>private property</b> and <b>caused damage in</b> the <b>private property</b> of <b>another,</b> in all these cases he is <b>liable.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach that he is liable in all these cases because in each one there is a novel element. <b>As if it had taught</b> only the case of <b>one who was chopping</b> wood <b>in</b> his <b>private property and caused damage in the public domain,</b> it might have been reasoned that he is liable, despite the fact that he was working in his private property, <b>because</b> it is <b>common</b> for the <b>multitudes</b> to be there. <b>But</b> if a chip flew <b>from the public domain to</b> another person’s <b>private property, where</b> it is <b>not common</b> for the <b>multitudes</b> to be, one might <b>say</b> that he is <b>not</b> liable. Therefore, it is necessary to teach this case as well.
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if it had taught</b> that he is liable where the chip flew <b>from the public domain to</b> another’s <b>private property,</b> it might have been reasoned that he is liable <b>because at the outset he was acting without permission by chopping wood in the public domain. But</b> if it flew <b>from</b> his <b>private property to the public domain, since he was acting with permission</b> by chopping wood in his private property, one might <b>say</b> that he is <b>not</b> liable. Therefore, it is necessary to teach both cases.
<b>And if</b> the mishna <b>had taught</b> only that he is liable in <b>these two</b> cases, it might have been reasoned that in <b>this</b> case, where the damage was caused in the public domain, he is liable <b>because</b> it is <b>common</b> for the <b>multitudes</b> to be there, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, where he was chopping in the public domain, he is liable <b>because</b> he was acting <b>without permission. But</b> in the last case, where the chip flew <b>from</b> his <b>private property</b> to <b>another’s private property,</b> where neither of the above reasons applies, <b>as</b> it is <b>not common</b> for the <b>multitudes</b> to be in the place where the damage was caused <b>and he</b> was acting <b>with permission at the outset,</b> one might <b>say</b> he is <b>not</b> liable. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to teach all these cases.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:25): With regard to <b>one who entered the workshop of a carpenter without</b> the latter’s <b>permission, and a chip of wood flew off and hit him in the face and he died,</b> the carpenter is <b>exempt. But if he entered</b> the shop <b>with permission,</b> the carpenter is <b>liable.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it rules that the carpenter is <b>liable? Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says:</b> If the other person was injured, he is <b>liable to</b> pay <b>four types of indemnity</b> that one who injures another must pay. These are: Cost of the damage, pain, medical costs, and loss of livelihood. <b>But</b> if the one who entered was killed, he is <b>exempt from exile.</b>
The Gemara explains that he is exempt <b>because</b> this case <b>is not similar to</b> the case of <b>a forest,</b> which is the archetypal case stated in the Torah requiring one who kills unintentionally to be exiled, as it is written: “As when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to chop wood, and his hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree, and the head slips off the helve, and finds his neighbor, and he dies” (Deuteronomy 19:5). This is because in the case of the <b>forest,</b> both <b>this one entered his domain and that one entered his domain,</b> as anyone may use the public domain, whereas in <b>this</b> case, the victim <b>entered another’s property.</b> Therefore, the carpenter is not exiled.
<b>Rava said:</b> On the contrary; it can be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that he is exiled. <b>And if</b> in the case of the <b>forest,</b> where <b>this one entered of his own accord and that one entered of his own accord,</b> neither asking for the other’s permission, nevertheless the victim <b>is considered like one who entered with the other’s consent and</b> therefore the one who kills unintentionally <b>is exiled, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that in <b>this</b> case, <b>where</b> the victim <b>entered another’s</b> workshop <b>with his consent,</b> the carpenter should be exiled?
<b>Rather, Rava said: What</b> is the reason <b>he is exempt from exile? As exile is not sufficient for him, and this is the reason of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina,</b> who exempts him from exile: <b>Because it is</b> an <b>unintentional</b> killing that is <b>approaching intentional</b> manslaughter. The purpose of exile is to atone for one who kills another completely unintentionally; if he was exceedingly negligent, exile is not sufficient to atone for him.
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> to his own explanation from a mishna: If one is sentenced to be flogged in court and the doctors assessed that he would be able to endure only a certain number of lashes, but the one administering the lashes <b>added one lash to his</b> punishment <b>and he died,</b> the agent of the court <b>is exiled on account of him</b> (<i>Makkot</i> 22b). <b>But here,</b> it is clear <b>that it is</b> a case of <b>an unintentional</b> killing that is <b>approaching intentional</b> manslaughter, <b>as it should have entered his mind that people can die by one</b> additional <b>lash. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that the agent of the court <b>is exiled. Rav Shimi of Neharde’a said</b> in response: It is a case <b>where he erred in the counting,</b> which is not considered approaching intentional manslaughter.
<b>Rava slapped</b> Rav Shimi <b>on his sandal,</b> a gesture of disparagement, and <b>said to him: Is that to say</b> that the one administering the lashes is the one who <b>counts</b> them? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the eldest of the judges recites</b> the verses that are read to a person while he receives lashes, <b>and the second</b> judge <b>counts, and the third says</b> to the one administering the lashes: <b>Strike him?</b> Accordingly, it is not the one administering the lashes who erred in counting.
<b>Rather, Rav Shimi of Neharde’a said:</b> It is a case <b>where the judge himself erred</b> in counting, and the one administering the lashes did not notice this error and meted out an extra lash, causing the person to die. It is therefore considered a completely unintentional killing. Consequently, he is exiled.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from another mishna: With regard to <b>one who throws a stone into the public domain and kills</b> someone, <b>he is exiled. But here,</b> it is clear <b>that it is</b> a case of <b>an unintentional</b> killing that is <b>approaching intentional</b> manslaughter, <b>as it should have entered his mind that people are commonly</b> found <b>in the public domain. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>he is exiled.</b>
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It is not a case where one threw a stone into the public domain for no purpose, but rather <b>where he demolishes his wall,</b> which borders on the public domain, and stones fall into the public domain. Therefore, it is not considered to be approaching intentional manslaughter.
The Gemara questions this assertion: Nevertheless, <b>he should have paid attention</b> to see if there was anyone there, and therefore it should be considered an unintentional killing that approaches intentional manslaughter. The Gemara answers: It is a case <b>where he demolishes</b> the wall <b>at night.</b>
The Gemara asks: Even <b>at night, he should also have paid attention</b> to see if there was anyone there. The Gemara suggests an alternative interpretation: It is a case <b>where he demolishes his wall during the day into a garbage dump,</b> where people are not commonly found.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this garbage dump? If</b> it is a garbage dump <b>where the multitudes are commonly</b> found, <b>it is</b> considered <b>intentional</b> manslaughter. <b>And if the multitudes are not commonly</b> found there, he should be considered not only one who kills unintentionally, but <b>a victim of circumstances beyond his control,</b> since he could not have anticipated that someone would be there. Therefore, he should be exempt from exile.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>is necessary only in</b> the case of <b>a garbage dump where</b> people are <b>given to relieve themselves at night and are not given to relieve themselves during the day,</b> as it is near the public domain. <b>But there are those who chance by and sit</b> there for this purpose even during the day. On the one hand, <b>he is not</b> one who kills <b>intentionally, as</b> people <b>are not given to relieve themselves</b> there <b>during the day.</b> On the other hand, <b>he is not a victim of circumstances beyond his control either, as there are those who chance by and sit there.</b> Therefore, he is considered one who kills unintentionally and is liable to be exiled.
<b>Rav Pappa taught in the name of Rava</b> that <b>this</b> aforementioned statement of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina is in reference not to the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> but is <b>in reference to the first clause:</b> With regard to <b>one who enters the workshop of a carpenter without permission, and a chip</b> of wood <b>flies off and strikes him in the face and he dies,</b> the carpenter is <b>exempt.</b> In reference to this clause <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says:</b> If the one who entered was merely injured, the carpenter is <b>liable to</b> pay <b>four types of indemnity. But</b> if the one who entered was killed, he is <b>exempt from exile.</b>
The Gemara comments: With regard to <b>the one who teaches this</b> statement <b>in reference to the last clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, where one enters with permission, <b>all the more so</b> would he teach it <b>in reference to the first clause,</b> where one enters without permission. <b>But the one who teaches this</b> statement <b>in reference to the first clause</b> teaches it only in reference to that clause. <b>But in the</b> case of the <b>last clause, since</b> he entered <b>with permission</b> the carpenter is <b>liable</b> to go into <b>exile.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But is he liable</b> to go into <b>exile</b> when the victim had permission to enter? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>one who enters the workshop of a welder, and sparks [<i>nitzotzot</i>] fly off and strike him in his face and he dies,</b> the welder is <b>exempt, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if</b> the victim <b>entered with permission?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here,</b> in this <i>baraita</i>? We are dealing <b>with the welder’s apprentice</b> who enters his workshop. The Gemara asks: <b>Does the welder’s apprentice stand to be killed,</b> i.e., is it permitted to kill him? The Gemara answers: It is a case <b>where his mentor is urging him to leave, and he does not leave.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And because his mentor is urging him to leave, does he stand to be killed?</b> The welder should be careful until his apprentice leaves. The Gemara answers: The welder <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> had already <b>left</b> when the accident happened. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why establish that the <i>baraita</i> refers specifically to an apprentice? The welder would be exempt if it were any <b>other</b> person <b>also.</b>

Daf 33a

The Gemara answers: <b>Another</b> person <b>does not have awe of his mentor.</b> Therefore, even if the welder urges another person to leave, he must ascertain that that person actually did so, and otherwise he is liable to be exiled. By contrast, <b>this</b> apprentice <b>has awe of his mentor,</b> and so the welder may assume that if he instructed him to leave, he certainly did. Therefore, if in reality the apprentice did not leave and is killed by the sparks, the welder is not liable to be exiled, as he is not held accountable.
<b>Rav Zevid taught in the name of Rava</b> that <b>this</b> aforementioned statement of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina is in reference not to the above <i>baraita</i> but is <b>in reference to this</b> <i>baraita</i>: It is stated in the verse concerning one who kills unintentionally: “And the head slips off the helve, <b>and finds</b> his neighbor, and he dies” (Deuteronomy 19:5); this serves to <b>exclude</b> one <b>who introduces himself</b> into an area of danger, in which case the one who kills unintentionally is exempt from exile. <b>From here Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> With regard to <b>one whom a stone departed from his hand, and another</b> person <b>stuck out his head and received</b> a blow from <b>it</b> and died, the one who threw the stone is <b>exempt</b> from exile. It is in reference to this statement that <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: He is exempt from exile</b> for killing him. <b>But</b> if the victim was merely injured, he is <b>liable to</b> pay <b>four types of indemnity.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>The one who teaches this</b> statement <b>in reference to this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>all the more so</b> he would teach it <b>in reference to the first</b> <i>baraita</i>, where one entered the workshop of the carpenter. <b>But the one who teaches it with regard to the first</b> <i>baraita</i> teaches it only in reference to that <i>baraita</i>. <b>But in this</b> <i>baraita</i> he is <b>entirely exempt</b> from liability for injury, as one could claim that he is completely blameless.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to salaried <b>laborers who came</b> into their employer’s courtyard <b>to claim their wages from the homeowner, and the homeowner’s ox gored them, or the homeowner’s dog bit them, and</b> a laborer <b>died,</b> the homeowner is <b>exempt. Others say</b> that he is liable, as salaried <b>laborers are allowed</b> to enter their employer’s property <b>to claim their wages from the homeowner.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> the employer <b>can be found in the city, what is the reason of the others,</b> who hold him liable? The laborers could have met him in the city to claim their wages and did not need to enter his courtyard. <b>If he can be found</b> only <b>at home, what is the reason of the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who exempts him? Clearly they are entitled to claim their wages.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> these are not the circumstances under discussion. This <i>halakha</i> is <b>necessary</b> only <b>with regard to a man who can</b> sometimes <b>be found</b> in town <b>and</b> sometimes <b>cannot be found</b> in town, <b>and</b> the laborers <b>called</b> to him <b>at the gate</b> of his courtyard, <b>and he said to them: Yes.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> referred to as the others, <b>holds</b> that the term <b>yes</b> in this context <b>indicates: Come in.</b> Therefore, he is liable for their death. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that the term <b>yes</b> in this context <b>indicates: Stand in your place</b> and I will come out to you. Since he did not give them permission to enter, he is exempt.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that <b>yes</b> in this context <b>indicates: Stand in your place. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a salaried <b>laborer who entered</b> his employer’s courtyard <b>to claim his wages from the homeowner, and the homeowner’s ox gored him, or his dog bit him,</b> the homeowner <b>is exempt, although</b> the laborer <b>entered with permission.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is he <b>exempt</b> if the laborer entered with permission? <b>Rather, is it not</b> because it is a case <b>where</b> the laborer <b>called</b> him <b>at the gate, and</b> he <b>said to him: Yes? Conclude from it</b> that <b>yes</b> in this context <b>indicates: Stand in your place.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>two innocuous oxen that injured each other,</b> the respective damages are evaluated, and if one amount is more than the other, the owner <b>pays half the damages with regard to the difference.</b> In other words, the owner of the ox that caused the greater damage pays the other owner half the difference. If <b>both oxen were forewarned,</b> the owner of the ox that caused the greater damage <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage with regard to the difference.</b>
In a case where <b>one</b> of the oxen was <b>innocuous and</b> the other <b>one</b> was <b>forewarned,</b> if the <b>forewarned</b> ox caused greater damage <b>to</b> the <b>innocuous</b> ox than the reverse, the owner of the forewarned ox <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage with regard to the difference.</b> If the <b>innocuous</b> ox caused greater damage <b>to</b> the <b>forewarned</b> ox, its owner <b>pays half the damage with regard to the difference.</b>
<b>And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>two people who injured each other,</b> the one who did greater damage <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage with regard to the difference,</b> since one is always considered forewarned with regard to damage he causes.
If <b>a person</b> caused damage <b>to a forewarned</b> ox <b>and</b> the <b>forewarned</b> ox caused damage <b>to</b> the <b>person,</b> whichever side caused the greater damage <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage with regard to the difference.</b> In a case where <b>a person</b> caused damage <b>to an innocuous</b> ox <b>and</b> the <b>innocuous</b> ox caused damage <b>to</b> the <b>person,</b> if <b>the person</b> caused greater financial damage <b>to</b> the <b>innocuous</b> ox <b>he pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage with regard to the difference.</b> If the <b>innocuous</b> ox caused greater damage <b>to the person,</b> its owner <b>pays</b> only <b>half the damage with regard to the difference. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The owner of the <b>innocuous</b> ox <b>that injured a person also pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage with regard to the difference.</b> Rabbi Akiva does not distinguish between an innocuous and a forewarned ox in a case where an ox injures a person.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the dispute between Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis about a case where an ox injures a person, <b>the Sages taught:</b> It is derived from the verse: “Whether it has gored a son, or has gored a daughter, <b>according to this judgment shall it be done to him”</b> (Exodus 21:31), that <b>as is the judgment</b> concerning <b>an ox</b> that causes damage <b>to an ox, so is the judgment</b> with regard to <b>an ox</b> that causes damage <b>to a person. Just as</b> with regard to <b>an ox</b> that causes damage <b>to an ox,</b> if it is <b>innocuous</b> its owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage and</b> if it is <b>forewarned</b> he pays the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage, so too,</b> with regard to <b>an ox</b> that causes damage <b>to a person,</b> if it is an <b>innocuous</b> ox its owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage and</b> if it is a <b>forewarned</b> ox the owner pays the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
<b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> It is derived from the phrase <b>“according to this judgment”</b> that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an ox that gores a person is judged <b>like</b> the case that appears in <b>the lower</b> verse, i.e., the case of a forewarned ox, which appears in Exodus 21:29, <b>and not like</b> the case that appears in <b>the upper</b> verse, i.e., the case of an innocuous ox, which appears in Exodus 21:28.
One <b>might</b> have thought that since the case of an ox that gored a person is compared to the case of a forewarned ox, the owner also <b>pays from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Shall it be done to him [<i>lo</i>],”</b> indicating <b>he pays</b> restitution exclusively <b>from</b> the proceeds of the sale of the <b>body</b> of his belligerent ox <b>and does not pay from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, as the word <i>lo</i> can also be understood as referring to the ox. In this manner the case of an innocuous ox that gores a person is compared to the <i>halakha</i> of an innocuous ox that gores another ox, whereas with regard to the amount of restitution, it is compared to the case of a forewarned ox.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who do not differentiate between an ox that gores a person and one that gores an animal, inasmuch as the distinction between an innocuous and a forewarned ox applies in both cases, <b>why do I</b> need the seemingly superfluous word <b>“this”?</b> The Gemara answers: The word is stated <b>to exempt him from the four types of indemnity</b> that one who injures another person is liable to pay, thereby emphasizing the comparison to the case of an ox that gores an ox.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where does Rabbi Akiva</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>exempting him from</b> paying these <b>four types of indemnity?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“And if a man maims his neighbor,</b> as he has done, so shall be done to him” (Leviticus 24:19). Rabbi Akiva derives from here that only when <b>a man</b> injures <b>his neighbor</b> is he liable to pay these four types of indemnity, <b>but not</b> when <b>an ox</b> injures <b>his neighbor.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why do <b>the Rabbis</b> not derive this <i>halakha</i> from that verse? The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it would have been derived <b>from that</b> verse, <b>I would have said</b> that he is exempt <b>only</b> from paying for <b>pain, but</b> for <b>medical costs and loss of liveli-hood,</b> I would <b>say</b> that he is liable <b>to give him</b> compensation. Therefore, the phrase “according to this judgment” <b>teaches us</b> that he is not liable to pay compensation for anything other than the damage itself.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to an innocuous <b>ox worth one hundred dinars that gored an ox worth two hundred</b> dinars, <b>and the carcass</b> of the dead ox <b>is not worth anything,</b> its owner <b>takes the</b> entire <b>ox</b> that gored it, since it is worth half the value of the damage.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in the <b>mishna,</b> which rules that the injured party takes the ox immediately? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: After it gores another ox, <b>the</b> belligerent <b>ox shall be appraised in court</b> before it is taken by the injured party, this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: The ox was</b> already <b>assigned</b> to the owner of the dead ox as payment, and if the amount of damages is not contested by the owner of the goring ox, no further legal steps are required.
The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> they <b>disagree? Rabbi Yishmael holds</b> that the owner of the dead ox <b>is</b> considered <b>a creditor</b> of the owner of the belligerent ox, <b>and it is money that he is claiming from him,</b> but he has no ownership of the body of the belligerent ox. <b>And Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>they are partners,</b> i.e., from the time the innocuous ox killed the other ox, the owner of the dead ox has a share of ownership in the belligerent ox.
<b>And they disagree with regard to</b> the meaning of <b>this verse: “Then they shall sell the live ox, and divide its monetary value”</b> (Exodus 21:35). <b>Rabbi Yishmael holds</b> that <b>the Merciful One is commanding the court</b> to evaluate the damages in this manner, <b>and Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>the Merciful One is commanding the injured</b> party <b>and the one liable for damage</b> to split ownership of the live ox, without the involvement of the court.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the two opinions as to whether or not they are considered partners? The Gemara answers: There <b>is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case where <b>the injured</b> party <b>consecrated</b> the ox to the Temple. According to the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael, until the court transfers the ox to the injured party, it still belongs to its owner, and therefore the injured party cannot consecrate it. According to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, the injured party owns the ox from the time the damage was inflicted, and he can therefore consecrate it.
<b>Rava asked Rav Naḥman:</b> If <b>the one liable for damage sold</b> the ox, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>according to Rabbi Yishmael?</b> Is it that <b>since Rabbi Yishmael says</b> that the injured party <b>is</b> considered <b>a creditor, and it is</b> merely <b>money that he is claiming from him, it is sold? Or perhaps</b>

Daf 33b

does he say that <b>since</b> the ox <b>is liened</b> to the debt <b>to the injured</b> party, who will collect it should the ox’s owner not have sufficient funds, <b>it is not in his</b> power to sell it? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: It is not sold.</b>
Rava asked him: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if <b>he sold it, it is sold?</b> Rav Naḥman replied: Nevertheless, the injured party <b>then collects it</b> from the purchaser. The Gemara asks: <b>Since</b> the injured party <b>then collects it</b> from the purchaser, <b>with regard to what</b> matter <b>is it sold?</b> His right to collect it negates the effectiveness of the sale. The Gemara answers: It is sold <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>plowing [<i>ridya</i>].</b> The purchaser may use the ox for plowing until the injured party collects it from him, and the purchaser is not required to reimburse the injured party for the use of his ox.
The Gemara asks: Should one <b>conclude from</b> this ruling that with regard to one who <b>borrows</b> money <b>and</b> then <b>sells</b> his <b>movable property, the court can collect</b> the debt <b>from</b> this property <b>on behalf of</b> the creditor, as according to Rabbi Yishmael the belligerent ox is only a lien for the debt owed to the injured party? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of the belligerent ox, <b>it is different, as</b> the owner of the ox <b>is</b> considered <b>like one who rendered it designated payment</b> of the debt, since the Torah specifies that the injured party collects damages from the ox. In general, however, movable property that is sold by a debtor cannot be collected by the creditor.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rava say</b> that if one <b>rendered his slave</b> as <b>designated repayment</b> for a debt <b>and</b> subsequently <b>sold him,</b> the <b>creditor collects</b> payment <b>from</b> the purchaser, whereas if one rendered <b>his ox</b> as <b>designated repayment and</b> then <b>sold it, the creditor cannot collect</b> it <b>from</b> the purchaser? This contradicts the previous statement that the belligerent ox is considered designated repayment, and therefore even if it is sold the injured party can collect it from the purchaser.
The Gemara answers: The distinction made in Rava’s statement answers this question. <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>a slave</b> who was rendered as designated repayment can be collected from the purchaser? It is <b>because</b> rendering a slave as designated repayment is not common and generates <b>publicity.</b> The purchaser was therefore aware of this when he bought the slave. Similarly, with regard to <b>this</b> ox <b>as well, since it gored</b> an animal, it generates <b>publicity, as</b> it is publicly <b>called a goring ox,</b> and so the purchaser was aware of the lien attached to it. Therefore, the injured party can collect it from the purchaser.
<b>Rav Taḥalifa from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> with regard to the belligerent ox <b>before Rabbi Abbahu:</b> If <b>he sold it, it is not sold,</b> but if <b>he consecrated it, it is consecrated.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Who sold it?</b> Is it the injured party or the liable party? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>the one liable for the damage, whose</b> opinion is it that if <b>he sold it,</b> it is <b>not sold? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>the ox was</b> already <b>assigned</b> to the injured party. <b>But</b> in the following statement of the <i>baraita</i>, that if <b>he consecrated it,</b> it is <b>consecrated, we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says</b> that <b>the ox shall be appraised in court.</b>
If, <b>rather,</b> it is referring to <b>the injured</b> party selling it, <b>whose</b> opinion is it that if <b>he sold it, it is not sold?</b> It is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who holds that the injured party has no share of ownership in the ox until it is transferred to him by the court. But in the statement that if <b>he consecrated it,</b> it is <b>consecrated, we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> The <i>baraita</i> does not seem to accord with either opinion.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> it is referring to <b>the one liable for the damage, and everyone agrees</b> with its ruling. The ruling that if <b>he sold it, it is not sold</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, as</b> the ox <b>is liened to the injured</b> party, precluding the owner from selling it.
The statement that if <b>he consecrated it,</b> it is <b>consecrated,</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> according <b>to Rabbi Akiva,</b> since it is not actually consecrated but is considered so only <b>due to</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu. As Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that if one consecrates liened property, although the consecration does not take effect, nevertheless he is required to redeem it, due to a rabbinic <b>decree lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>consecrated</b> property can be <b>removed</b> from the ownership of the Temple treasury <b>without redemption.</b> Therefore, the ineffectiveness of the ox’s consecration notwithstanding, he is still required to redeem it, by means of minimal payment, so as not to cause the denigration of Temple property.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an innocuous ox that caused damage,</b> if, <b>before</b> its owner <b>stood trial, he sold it,</b> it is <b>sold.</b> If <b>he consecrated it,</b> it is <b>consecrated.</b> If <b>he slaughtered it or gave it as a gift, what he did is done,</b> i.e., takes effect. By contrast, <b>once he stood trial</b> and is now obligated to pay the injured party, if <b>he sold it, it is not sold;</b> if <b>he consecrated it, it is not consecrated;</b> if <b>he slaughtered it or gave it is a gift, he has done nothing.</b>
If <b>creditors</b> of the ox’s owner <b>collected</b> the ox <b>first, whether he owed</b> the creditors <b>before</b> his ox <b>caused</b> the <b>damage or whether it caused</b> the <b>damage before he owed</b> them, <b>they have done nothing.</b> Their collection is void, <b>because</b> compensation to the injured party is <b>paid only from the body of</b> the ox, as it was innocuous, and it is therefore designated exclusively for this compensation.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to <b>a forewarned</b> ox <b>that caused damage, whether</b> its owner <b>stood trial or whether he did not stand trial,</b> if <b>he sold it,</b> it is <b>sold;</b> if <b>he consecrated it,</b> it is <b>consecrated;</b> if <b>he slaughtered it or gave it as a gift, what he did is done.</b> Likewise, if <b>creditors collected</b> the ox <b>first, whether he owed</b> them <b>before it caused</b> the <b>damage,</b> or <b>whether it caused</b> the <b>damage before he owed</b> them, <b>what</b> they <b>did is done.</b> This is <b>because</b> the restitution is <b>paid only from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, not from the body of the ox. Therefore, what he or his creditors do with the ox takes effect.
The Gemara explains the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> above, with regard to an innocuous ox, that if <b>he sold it,</b> it is <b>sold.</b> As explained above, the sale is valid only with regard to the purchaser using the ox <b>for plowing</b> in the interim, until the injured party collects it.
The statement that if <b>he consecrated it,</b> it is <b>consecrated</b> does not mean that it is actually consecrated, but rather that it must be redeemed through payment of a minimal sum, <b>due to Rabbi Abbahu’s</b> statement mentioned above.
With regard to the statement that if <b>he slaughtered it or gave it as a present, what he did is done,</b> the Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> if <b>he gave it as a present, what he did is done</b> with regard to the recipient’s permission to use it <b>for plowing. But</b> if <b>he slaughtered it,</b> how does that affect the injured party’s rights? <b>Let him come and receive payment from</b> the slaughtered ox’s <b>meat.</b>
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is stated in the Torah: “Then they shall sell the <b>live</b> ox” (Exodus 21:35). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the injured party receives a share of ownership if the belligerent ox is <b>alive. From where</b> do I derive that this applies even if the ox’s owner <b>slaughtered it? The verse states: “Then they shall sell</b> the live <b>ox,”</b> indicating that <b>in any case,</b> whatever the circumstances, the injured party is paid from proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox.
<b>Rav Sheizevi said:</b> This statement <b>is necessary only</b> with regard <b>to the diminished</b> value of the ox due to its <b>slaughter.</b> Although the value of the ox may no longer cover the damage, its owner is not liable to compensate the injured party beyond the ox’s current value.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: That is to say</b> that <b>one who causes damage to another’s liened property is exempt</b> from paying compensation, since the property does not actually belong to the one who holds the lien.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t this inference from the <i>baraita</i> <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, states this <i>halakha</i> <b>lest you say</b> that <b>it is</b> specifically <b>there,</b> in the case where one slaughters a liened ox, that he is exempt, <b>as he can say to him: I have not detracted anything from</b> what is <b>yours, as he can say to him: I took only spirit from</b> what is <b>yours.</b> He detracted only the life of the ox, not its physical body, and one who causes damage to another’s liened property might be exempt from liability for this intangible damage. <b>But generally</b> one who causes damage to another’s lien <b>should be liable.</b> Therefore, Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, <b>teaches us</b> that one is exempt from liability for all types of damage he causes to another’s liened property.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>Rabba stated this</b> principle, <b>as well,</b> and there would be no need for Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, to state it. <b>As Rabba says: One who burns another’s documents,</b> in which other people’s debts to him are recorded, <b>is exempt,</b> although the owner of the documents can no longer collect payment from liened property.
The Gemara answers: Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, states this principle <b>lest you say</b> that <b>it is</b> specifically <b>there</b> that he is exempt, <b>as</b> the perpetrator of the damage <b>can say to</b> the owner of the documents: <b>I burned your mere paper,</b> for which I am prepared to pay. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where one dug pits, ditches, or caves on</b> liened land, causing substantial damage, <b>he should be liable</b> to compensate the one holding the lien. Therefore, Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, <b>teaches us</b> that even in a case of substantial damage he is exempt, <b>as</b> the case <b>here,</b> where the ox was slaughtered, <b>is like one who dug pits, ditches, or caves,</b> as slaughter is considered substantial damage, <b>and</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>said</b> that in this case <b>what he did is done.</b>
The Gemara continues to explain the <i>baraita</i>, which states: If <b>creditors collected</b> the innocuous ox <b>first, whether</b> its owner <b>owed</b> them <b>before</b> his ox <b>caused damage or whether it caused damage before he owed</b> them, they <b>have done nothing, because</b> restitution is <b>paid only from the body of</b> the ox.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> in the case where <b>it caused damage before he owed</b> them, <b>the injured parties came first,</b> and the ox is liened to the debt. <b>But</b> in the case where <b>he owed</b> them <b>before it caused damage, the creditor</b> collected it <b>first,</b> so why does he not have the preemptive right to the ox?

Daf 34a

<b>Moreover, even</b> if the ox <b>caused damage before he owed</b> them, nevertheless <b>the creditor</b> came <b>first</b> and seized what he rightfully deserved. Should one <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that if <b>a later creditor collected</b> a debt <b>before</b> an earlier creditor, <b>his collection is not valid</b> and payment should instead be given to the earlier creditor?
The Gemara answers: <b>No; actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that <b>the collection of</b> the later creditor <b>is valid, and there,</b> in the case where a creditor seized the belligerent ox, <b>it is different, as</b> the injured party <b>can say to</b> the creditor who seized the ox: <b>If</b> the ox <b>was in your possession, would I not have collected it from you?</b> The reason I would take it is <b>that I am paid from this ox that caused me damage.</b> Therefore, the creditor cannot collect the ox, even if the debt preceded the damage.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to an innocuous <b>ox worth two hundred</b> dinars <b>that gored</b> another <b>ox</b> worth <b>two hundred</b> dinars <b>and injured it,</b> reducing its value <b>by fifty dinars [<i>zuz</i>], and</b> the injured ox subsequently <b>appreciated</b> in value, <b>and</b> its value <b>stood at four hundred dinars, while if</b> the belligerent ox <b>had not injured it, its</b> value <b>would have</b> now <b>stood at eight hundred dinars,</b> in this case the owner of the belligerent ox <b>gives him</b> only twenty-five dinars, which is half the value of the damage <b>according to</b> its value at <b>the time the injury</b> occurred.
If the injured ox <b>depreciated</b> in value and its worth is now less than at the time it was injured, the damage is evaluated <b>according to</b> the ox’s worth at <b>the time of standing trial.</b> In other words, the owner of the belligerent ox must pay the difference between its value before it was injured and its current value.
If the ox <b>that caused the injury,</b> from which the owner of the injured ox collects damages, <b>appreciated</b> in value, its owner <b>gives</b> the injured party a share of the ox <b>according to</b> its value <b>at the time of the injury.</b> If <b>it depreciated</b> in value, the owner gives him a share <b>according to</b> its value at <b>the time of standing trial.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>The Master said</b> in the first clause of the second half of the <i>baraita</i> that if the ox <b>that caused the damage appreciated</b> in value, its owner <b>gives</b> the injured party a share <b>according to</b> the ox’s value at <b>the time of the injury.</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is</b> this ruling? <b>It is</b> apparently in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says</b> that the injured party <b>is</b> considered <b>a creditor, and it is money that he is claiming from him,</b> as he has no share of ownership in the belligerent ox.
The Gemara states a difficulty with this explanation: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the second half of the <i>baraita</i>: If the belligerent ox <b>depreciated</b> in value, the owner gives the injured party a share <b>according to</b> its value at <b>the time of standing trial.</b> Here <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that the owners of the two oxen <b>are partners,</b> i.e., the injured party has a share of ownership in the belligerent ox. How can it be that <b>the first clause</b> is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Yishmael’s</b> opinion, and <b>the latter clause</b> follows the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>No, it is all</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> that they are partners, <b>and here,</b> in the case where the belligerent ox appreciated in value, <b>we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the reason it appreciated is that its owner <b>fattened it.</b> Though the injured party has a share of ownership in the ox, he has no share in the appreciation in value, and his share is therefore calculated according to its value at the time of the injury.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>fattened it, say the first clause</b> of the first half of the <i>baraita</i>, stated with regard to the injured ox: If <b>it appreciated</b> in value, and its value <b>stood at four hundred dinars,</b> the owner of the belligerent ox <b>gives him</b> compensation <b>according to</b> its value <b>at the time of the injury. If</b> this is referring to a case <b>where</b> its owner <b>fattened it, need it be said</b> that the owner of the belligerent ox is not exempt from compensation?
<b>Rav Pappa said: You find</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated in <b>the first clause</b> of the first half of the <i>baraita</i> to be true <b>whether he fattened it or whether it appreciated</b> in value <b>by itself. And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>found it necessary</b> to mention this <i>halakha</i> <b>to teach us that</b> even in a case <b>where</b> the ox <b>appreciated</b> in value <b>by itself,</b> the owner of the belligerent ox <b>gives him</b> compensation <b>according to</b> its value <b>at the time of the injury</b> and not at the time of the trial. By contrast, <b>you find</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated in <b>the latter clause</b> of the second half of the <i>baraita</i>, with regard to a case where the belligerent ox appreciated in value, <b>only where</b> its owner <b>fattened it.</b>
It is stated in the latter clause of the first half of the <i>baraita</i> that if the injured ox <b>depreciated</b> in value, it is evaluated <b>according to</b> its worth at <b>the time of standing trial.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Due to what did it depreciate</b> in value? <b>If we say that</b> the ox <b>depreciated</b> in value <b>due to labor</b> for which it was used, <b>let</b> the liable party <b>say to him: You reduced</b> its <b>value and I should</b> therefore <b>give</b> you extra compensation?
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is a case <b>where it depreciated</b> in value <b>due to the</b> continuous effect of the <b>wound, as</b> the injured party <b>can say to him: The horn of your ox is buried in it,</b> i.e., it is still losing value due to the wound.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to an innocuous <b>ox worth two hundred</b> dinars <b>that gored</b> another <b>ox worth two hundred, and the carcass is worth nothing, Rabbi Meir said:</b> It is <b>about this</b> type of case that <b>it is stated: “Then they shall sell the live ox, and divide its monetary value”</b> (Exodus 21:35).
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said to him: And that is</b> the <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> yet your interpretation of the verse is incorrect. <b>You have upheld</b> the clause: <b>“Then they shall sell the live ox and divide its monetary value,”</b> which fits your interpretation of the case. But <b>you have not upheld</b> the latter clause of the verse: <b>“And the dead they shall also divide,”</b> since in the case you mentioned the carcass is worthless. Rather, to <b>which</b> case is the verse referring? <b>It is</b> the case of <b>an ox worth two hundred</b> dinars <b>that gored</b> another <b>ox worth two hundred</b> dinars, <b>and the carcass is worth fifty dinars.</b> In this case, <b>this</b> party <b>takes half</b> the value of <b>the living</b> ox, one hundred dinars, <b>and half the</b> value of the <b>dead</b> ox, twenty-five dinars; <b>and that</b> party also <b>takes half</b> the value of <b>the living</b> ox <b>and half</b> the value of <b>the dead</b> ox.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>an ox worth two hundred</b> dinars <b>that gored an ox worth two hundred</b> dinars, <b>and the carcass is worth fifty dinars, this</b> party <b>takes half</b> the value of <b>the living</b> ox <b>and half</b> the value of <b>the dead</b> ox, <b>and that</b> party also <b>takes half</b> the value of <b>the living</b> ox <b>and half</b> the value of <b>the dead</b> ox, <b>and this is the</b> case of the belligerent <b>ox stated in the Torah.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Meir says: This is not</b> the case of the <b>ox stated in the Torah. Rather,</b> it is the case of <b>an ox worth two hundred</b> dinars <b>that gored an ox worth two hundred</b> dinars, <b>and the carcass is worth nothing.</b> It is <b>about this</b> case that <b>it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“Then they shall sell the live ox, and divide its monetary value.” Rather, how do I realize</b> the meaning of <b>“And the dead they shall also divide”?</b> This clause means that the <b>diminished</b> value of the dead ox <b>that was diminished by</b> its <b>death</b> is compensated for by <b>dividing</b> the value of <b>the live</b> ox between the two parties, while its owner does not receive a share in the carcass of the dead ox.
The Gemara asks: <b>Now, both Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda</b> hold that in the case described by Rabbi Yehuda, where the carcass is worth fifty, <b>this</b> party <b>takes one hundred and twenty-five, and that</b> party <b>takes one hundred and twenty-five.</b> Rabbi Meir holds that the injured party keeps the carcass, worth fifty, and receives another seventy-five dinars, half the value of the damage, from the proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox. Its owner is thereby left with one hundred and twenty-five dinars out of the two hundred that it is worth. Rabbi Yehuda maintains that the value of both oxen is split between the two parties, leaving each with one hundred and twenty-five. If so, <b>what is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the two <i>tanna’im</i>? Why does it matter in which manner the compensation is calculated?
<b>Rava said: There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to <b>the diminishing</b> value <b>of the carcass.</b> If the carcass depreciates in value between the ox’s death and the time it is sold, <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>the diminishing</b> value <b>of the carcass</b> is sustained <b>by the injured</b> party. The one liable for the damage is not responsible for any depreciation in value that occurs after the loss caused by the attack has been evaluated. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>half of the diminishing</b> value <b>of the carcass</b> is sustained <b>by the one liable for damage,</b> since he receives half of the dead ox.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>If so, we have found, according to Rabbi Yehuda,</b>

Daf 34b

a case where the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an innocuous</b> ox that causes damage <b>is more stringent than</b> with regard to <b>a forewarned</b> ox, since according to all opinions, in a case where a forewarned ox kills another ox, the carcass belongs exclusively to the injured party, and he sustains any subsequent decrease in its value.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed,</b> Rabbi Yehuda holds that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an innocuous ox is more stringent than with regard to a forewarned ox, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If a bailee did not safeguard an ox properly, and it escaped and caused damage, if it was <b>an innocuous</b> ox he <b>is liable, and</b> if it was <b>a forewarned</b> ox he <b>is exempt</b> (45b), that mishna cannot serve as proof for the issue under discussion. <b>Say that you heard Rabbi Yehuda</b> express this opinion, that the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an innocuous ox is more stringent, <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>safeguarding, as verses are written</b> in the Torah from which this <i>halakha</i> is derived. But <b>with regard to compensation, did you</b> ever <b>hear him</b> express this opinion?
On the contrary; <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that in the case of <b>an ox worth one hundred dinars that gored an ox worth five <i>sela</i>,</b> i.e., twenty dinars, <b>and the carcass is worth one <i>sela</i>,</b> i.e., four dinars, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>this</b> party <b>takes half the living</b> ox <b>and half the dead</b> ox, <b>and that</b> party <b>takes half the living</b> ox <b>and half the dead</b> ox. Accordingly, the injured party receives fifty-two dinars in value, which is much more than his ox was worth before it was killed.
Instead, continues Rabbi Yehuda, you should <b>say: For what</b> purpose <b>is</b> the case of <b>a forewarned</b> ox <b>singled out</b> by the <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>to render it</b> more <b>stringent</b> than the case of an innocuous ox, or <b>to render it</b> more <b>lenient?</b> Clearly, <b>you must say</b> that it is <b>to render it</b> more <b>stringent.</b> And therefore, <b>if</b> in the case of <b>a forewarned</b> ox, its owner <b>pays only</b> the value of <b>what he damaged</b> and no more, in the case of <b>an innocuous</b> ox, <b>which is</b> more <b>lenient, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that the owner is not liable to pay more than the value of the damage? Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda does not allow for liability in the case of an innocuous ox to be more stringent than in the case of a forewarned ox.
<b>Rather,</b> Rava’s explanation, that Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda disagree with regard to a case where the carcass depreciated in value, should be rejected. Instead, their dispute should be explained according to what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said,</b> i.e., that the practical difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to <b>the appreciation of the carcass</b> in value after the ox’s death; <b>as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Meir, <b>holds</b> that the entire increased value of the carcass <b>belongs to the injured</b> party, since the owner of the belligerent ox has no share in the carcass, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>half</b> of the increased value belongs to the injured party and half goes to the one liable for the damage.
<b>And this</b> explains <b>what was difficult for Rabbi Yehuda</b> in another <i>baraita</i>. <b>Now that you say</b> that <b>the Merciful One has mercy on the one liable for damage, as he takes</b> a share <b>of the increased value</b> of the carcass, <b>can</b> it be that in the case of <b>an ox worth five <i>sela</i>,</b> i.e., twenty dinars, <b>that gored an ox worth one hundred dinars, and the carcass is worth fifty dinars, this</b> party <b>takes half the live</b> ox <b>and half the dead</b> ox, <b>and that</b> party <b>takes half the live</b> ox <b>and half the dead</b> ox? Accordingly, the owner of the belligerent ox receives thirty-five dinars in value, which is more than his ox was worth.
Rather, <b>you</b> should <b>say: Where do we find</b> a case where <b>the one liable for damage gains</b> from the damage, comparable to this case, <b>where this</b> owner of the belligerent ox <b>gains,</b> receiving more than the value of his ox? Clearly there is no such case, as one who is liable for damage does not gain from it. <b>And</b> in addition, <b>it says: “He shall pay”</b> (Exodus 21:36), indicating that <b>the owner</b> of the belligerent ox <b>pays, and the owner does not take</b> more than the amount his animal was worth at the time of the damage.
The Gemara asks: For <b>what</b> reason was it necessary to add the claim: <b>And it says:</b> “He shall pay”? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> that the one liable for damage does not gain, <b>applies</b> specifically <b>where there is a loss sustained by the injured</b> party, as in this case, where the decrease in the ox’s value is fifty dinars, and if the carcass is shared by the liable party, the injured party receives only thirty-five dinars, thereby sustaining a loss. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where there is no loss sustained by the injured</b> party, <b>for example,</b> the case of <b>an ox worth five <i>sela</i>,</b> i.e., twenty dinars, <b>that gored</b> another <b>ox worth five <i>sela</i>, and the carcass</b> appreciated in value and is now <b>worth thirty dinars,</b> more than the ox was worth when it was alive, in this case <b>the one liable for damage also takes</b> a share <b>of the increased value,</b> since the injured party ends up not having sustained any financial loss, as he receives a share of ten dinars in the belligerent ox and another fifteen in the carcass, gaining five dinars over the value of his ox.
It is to counter this claim that Rabbi Yehuda adds: <b>And it says: “He shall pay,”</b> indicating that <b>the owner</b> of the belligerent ox <b>pays, and the owner does not take</b> more than the amount his animal was worth at the time of the damage.
§ With regard to Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion that the two owners split the value of both the belligerent ox and the dead ox between them, <b>Rav Aḥa bar Taḥalifa said to Rava: If so, we find</b> that <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> when <b>an innocuous</b> ox gores an ox that is worth less than it, its owner <b>pays more than half the damage. But the Torah stated: “Then they shall sell the live ox, and divide its monetary value”</b> (Exodus 21:35).
Rava answered him: <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> also <b>holds</b> that only the <b>diminished</b> value of the dead ox <b>that was diminished by</b> its <b>death</b> is compensated for by <b>dividing the live</b> ox between the two parties. The liable party never pays more than half the damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> does Rabbi Yehuda derive this <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“And the carcass they shall also divide”</b> (Exodus 21:35), from which Rabbi Meir derived it? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yehuda</b> already <b>derive from</b> this verse <b>that this</b> party <b>takes</b> the value of <b>half the live</b> ox <b>and half the dead</b> ox, <b>and that</b> party <b>takes</b> the value of <b>half the live</b> ox and <b>half the dead</b> ox?
The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> if that is the only <i>halakha</i> indicated by this clause, <b>let the verse</b> simply <b>write: And the carcass</b> they shall divide. <b>What is</b> the reason that the word <b>“also”</b> is added? It is added so that one may <b>conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from</b> the clause: That the carcass is also divided between the two parties, and that the liable party is never required to pay more than half the damage.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There</b> are cases where one is <b>liable for an act of</b> damage caused by <b>his ox, but exempt</b> from liability <b>for</b> the same <b>action</b> if he performed it <b>himself.</b> Conversely, there are also cases where one is <b>exempt</b> from liability <b>for the action of his ox, but liable for his own action.</b>
<b>How so?</b> If <b>his ox caused</b> a person <b>humilation,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation, <b>but</b> if <b>he</b> himself <b>humiliated</b> another, he is <b>liable.</b> Similarly, if <b>his ox blinded the eye of his slave or knocked out his</b> slave’s <b>tooth,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from having to emancipate the slave for this mutilation. <b>But if he</b> himself <b>blinded his slave’s eye or knocked out his tooth,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to emancipate him, as stated in the Torah (Exodus 21:26–27).
By contrast, if <b>his ox injured</b> the owner’s <b>father or his mother,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay damages, <b>but</b> if <b>he</b> himself <b>injured his father or his mother,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation. Similarly, if <b>his ox set fire to a haystack on Shabbat,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay damages. <b>But if he</b> himself <b>set fire to a haystack on Shabbat,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying damages. He is exempt from payment in these cases <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty for injuring his father or mother or for desecrating Shabbat.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Abbahu taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan: Anyone who performs</b> labor <b>destructively</b> on Shabbat <b>is exempt, except for one who injures</b> another <b>or kindles</b> a fire. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Go out</b> and <b>teach</b> it <b>outside;</b> this <i>baraita</i> is not fit for discussion in the study hall. The opinion that deems one liable for <b>injuring</b> another <b>or kindling</b> a fire on Shabbat <b>is not a mishna</b> and should be ignored. <b>And if you say that it is a mishna, one who injures</b> another would be liable only in a case <b>where he requires</b> the blood to give <b>to his dog, and one who kindles</b> a fire would be liable only in a case <b>where he requires its ashes.</b> In these cases, the act is not purely destructive but has some constructive purpose.
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>his ox set fire to a haystack on Shabbat,</b> he is <b>liable. But</b> if <b>he</b> himself <b>set fire to a haystack on Shabbat,</b> he is <b>exempt. And</b> the mishna <b>is</b> presumably <b>teaching</b> a case where <b>he</b> set the fire in a scenario that is <b>similar to</b> the case <b>where his ox</b> did so. <b>Just as</b> in the case <b>where his ox</b> set the fire <b>it</b> clearly <b>does not need</b> the ashes, as an ox does not act with such intentions,

Daf 35a

<b>so too,</b> in the case where <b>he</b> set the fire, it is presumably a case <b>where he does not need</b> the ashes. <b>And</b> nevertheless, the mishna <b>teaches</b> that he is <b>exempt because he is sentenced to death.</b> Apparently, one who lights a fire on Shabbat is liable even if he does not need the ashes, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No,</b> the comparison is the other way around; the case where <b>his ox</b> set the fire <b>is similar to</b> the case where <b>he</b> set the fire. <b>Just as</b> the case where <b>he</b> is liable for lighting a fire on Shabbat is one <b>where he needs</b> the ashes, <b>so too,</b> the case of <b>his ox</b> setting fire to the haystack is one <b>where it needs</b> the ashes.
The Gemara asks: In the case where <b>his ox</b> set the fire, <b>how can you find these</b> circumstances, where it did so because it needed the ashes? <b>Rav Avya said to him: Here we are dealing with an intelligent ox that was bitten on its back and wants to burn down</b> the haystack <b>and</b> then <b>roll around [<i>iggandar</i>] in the ashes</b> in order to heal the bite.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we know</b> that this is the reason that it set the fire? The Gemara answers: <b>Because after</b> the ox <b>burned</b> the haystack, <b>it was rolling around in the ashes.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And is there</b> really <b>a case like this?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as a certain ox that was at the house of Rav Pappa had a toothache. It went inside, and broke the lid</b> of a utensil, <b>and drank the liquor</b> inside <b>and was cured.</b> Evidently there are oxen with this level of intelligence.
<b>The Sages said before Rav Pappa: How can you say</b> that the case involving <b>his ox is similar to</b> the case involving <b>him? But doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach:</b> If <b>his ox caused</b> a person <b>humiliation</b>, he is <b>exempt, but</b> if <b>he humiliated</b> someone, he is <b>liable?</b> If the case of <b>his ox is</b> understood to be <b>similar to</b> the case involving <b>him, how can you find</b> a case where the ox <b>intended to humiliate</b> the person? One is liable for humiliating someone only when he intends to do so, and an ox never has intention to humiliate.
The Gemara answers: It is a case <b>where</b> the ox <b>intended to cause injury.</b> If it was the action of a person, he would be liable for the humiliation he caused as well, <b>as the Master said:</b> In a case where <b>a person intended to cause injury,</b> he is liable for humiliation <b>even if he did not intend to humiliate</b> his victim.
<b>Rava said</b> a different solution with regard to the difficulty that the mishna poses to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>The mishna</b> is referring <b>to</b> a case where one lit a fire on Shabbat <b>unintentionally.</b> Although he is not liable to receive the death penalty, nevertheless, since he performed a prohibited action that would carry the death penalty were it to be performed deliberately, he is still exempt from monetary restitution.
The Gemara explains: This is <b>in accordance with what the school of Ḥizkiyya taught, as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught:</b> The verse states: “And he who kills an animal shall pay for it, and he who kills a man shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:21), indicating that <b>one who kills a man and one who kills an animal</b> are comparable.
This teaches that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>one who kills an animal,</b> the Torah <b>did not differentiate</b> between <b>whether</b> he does so <b>unintentionally or whether</b> he does so <b>intentionally, whether advertently or inadvertently, whether by way of descent or by way of ascent,</b> and this was not <b>to exempt him from</b> paying <b>monetary restitution</b> in all these cases but <b>rather to render him liable</b> to pay <b>monetary restitution,</b> as one who kills an animal is liable in any event, <b>similarly, with regard to one who kills a man, do not differentiate</b> between <b>whether</b> he does so <b>intentionally or unintentionally, whether advertently or inadvertently, whether by way of descent or by way of ascent,</b> and this was not <b>to render him liable</b> to pay <b>monetary restitution</b> for the damage he causes in the process of killing him, but <b>rather to exempt him from</b> paying <b>monetary restitution</b> in any event. It is derived from here that one who commits a transgression carrying the death penalty is exempt from paying damages for his action, even if he is not in practice given the death penalty.
<b>The Sages said to Rava: Can you</b> really <b>interpret</b> the mishna as referring <b>to</b> a case where the transgression was <b>unintentional? But doesn’t it teach</b> that the transgressor is exempt <b>because he is sentenced to death,</b> which is only the case if the transgression was intentional?
Rava answered that <b>this is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> He is exempt, <b>since</b> when this action is performed <b>intentionally,</b> the transgressor is liable to be <b>sentenced to death. And what are the circumstances</b> in which one is liable to receive the death penalty for deliberately lighting a fire on Shabbat? It is a case <b>where he needs the ashes.</b> Therefore, even <b>now, when</b> the transgression was <b>unintentional, he is exempt</b> from paying damages.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an ox that was pursuing another ox, and</b> the ox being pursued <b>became injured,</b> but there are no witnesses as to how it was injured, and <b>this</b> one, the owner of the injured ox, <b>says</b> to the owner of the pursuing ox: <b>Your ox injured</b> my ox, and you are liable to pay me damages, <b>and that</b> one, the owner of the pursuing ox, <b>says</b> in response: <b>No; rather, it was hurt by a rock,</b> and I am not liable, then in this case, <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b> As long as the owner of the injured ox cannot prove that the injury was inflicted by the pursuing ox, the owner of the pursuing ox is not liable.
In a case where <b>two</b> oxen, belonging to two different owners, <b>were pursuing one</b> ox belonging to a third person, and that ox was injured by one of the pursuing oxen, and <b>this</b> one, the owner of one of the pursuing oxen, <b>says</b> to the owner of the other: It was <b>your ox</b> that <b>caused the injury, and that</b> one, the owner of the other pursuing ox, <b>says:</b> No, it was <b>your ox</b> that <b>caused the injury,</b>

Daf 35b

<b>the two of them are exempt,</b> since each of them rejects the claim of the injured party that his ox caused the injury. <b>If both</b> oxen <b>belonged to one person, both are liable,</b> as will be explained in the Gemara.
If the pursuing oxen both belonged to one person, and were both innocuous, so that restitution is paid exclusively from proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox, and <b>one was large and</b> the other <b>one small,</b> in this case, if <b>the injured</b> party <b>says</b> that <b>the large</b> ox <b>caused the damage,</b> and he is therefore entitled to receive restitution for half the damage from the value of the large ox, <b>but the one liable for damage says: No; rather, the small</b> ox <b>caused the damage,</b> and half of its value is not sufficient to cover half the damage; or, similarly, in a case where <b>one</b> ox <b>is innocuous and one is forewarned,</b> and <b>the injured</b> party <b>says:</b> The <b>forewarned</b> ox <b>caused the damage,</b> and the injured party is therefore eligible to receive full damages, <b>but the one liable for damage says: No; rather,</b> the <b>innocuous</b> ox <b>caused the damage,</b> in which case he is liable to pay only half the damage; in both of the above cases, the principle is that <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b>
If the <b>injured</b> animals <b>were two</b> oxen, <b>one large and</b> the other <b>one small, and the ones that caused the damage</b> were also <b>two</b> oxen, <b>one large and one small,</b> and <b>the injured</b> party <b>says: The large one injured the large one and the small one injured the small one, and the one liable for damage says: No; rather, the small one</b> injured <b>the large one,</b> in which case, if half the value of the belligerent ox does not cover half the damage, he is not required to pay more, <b>and the large one</b> injured <b>the small one;</b> or, similarly, if <b>one</b> of the belligerent oxen was <b>innocuous and one forewarned,</b> and <b>the injured</b> party <b>says:</b> The <b>forewarned</b> ox <b>injured the large</b> one, <b>and</b> the <b>innocuous</b> ox injured <b>the small one, and the one liable for damage says: No; rather,</b> the <b>innocuous</b> ox injured <b>the large one and</b> the <b>forewarned</b> ox injured <b>the small one;</b> here too, <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna rules that in a case where there is uncertainty with regard to whether it was the pursuing ox that caused the injury to the other ox, the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: That is to say</b> that <b>the colleagues of Sumakhos, who says</b> that <b>property of uncertain ownership is divided, disagree with his</b> opinion.
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel said to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Does Sumakhos state</b> this principle <b>even</b> in the case of <b>a certain</b> claim <b>and a certain</b> claim, i.e., where both parties maintain the certainty of their claims, as appears to be the case in the mishna? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to him: Yes, Sumakhos says</b> this <b>even</b> in a case of <b>a certain</b> claim <b>and a certain</b> claim.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it inferred <b>that the mishna</b> is referring to a case of <b>a certain</b> claim <b>and a certain</b> claim? <b>As it teaches</b> that <b>this</b> one, the owner of the injured ox, <b>says: Your ox injured</b> my ox, <b>and that</b> one, the owner of the pursuing ox, <b>says: No, rather</b> etc., indicating that both make their claims with certainty.
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this</b> interpretation of the case: <b>From</b> the suggestion <b>that</b> the case in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is one where there is <b>a certain</b> claim <b>and a certain</b> claim, it may be inferred that <b>the latter clause,</b> the subsequent clause in the mishna, <b>also</b> is referring to a case where there is <b>a certain</b> claim <b>and a certain</b> claim.
If so, <b>say the latter clause:</b> If <b>one was large and</b> the other <b>one small,</b> and <b>the injured</b> party <b>says</b> that <b>the large</b> ox <b>caused the damage, and the one liable for damage says: No; rather, the small</b> ox <b>caused the damage;</b> or if <b>one</b> ox <b>is innocuous and one is forewarned,</b> and <b>the injured</b> party <b>says:</b> The <b>forewarned</b> ox <b>caused the damage, but the one liable for damage says: No; rather,</b> the <b>innocuous</b> ox <b>caused the damage, the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b>
This indicates that <b>if he does not bring proof, he takes</b> compensation <b>according to what the one liable for damage says.</b> If it is a case where both parties maintain certainty of their claims, <b>let us say</b> that this mishna <b>is a conclusive refutation of</b> the statement of <b>Rabba bar Natan, who says</b> that if one <b>claims</b> that another owes him <b>wheat,</b> which he claims he deposited with him, <b>and</b> the other <b>concedes</b> that he owes <b>him barley,</b> which is less expensive than wheat, he is <b>exempt</b> from any payment, since he did not admit to what was claimed, and what he did admit was not claimed. Similarly, here, the injured party claims that it was the large ox that injured his ox, and the defendant admits that his small ox caused the injury, but not the large ox. His admission does not correspond to the claim. Yet, he is apparently liable to pay according to his admission, contrary to the ruling of Rabba bar Natan.
<b>Rather,</b> this clause must be referring to a case where there is <b>a certain</b> claim <b>and an uncertain</b> claim, i.e., one party maintains certainty of his claim, while the other merely states his claim as a possibility.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the one <b>who states a certain</b> claim, and <b>who is</b> the one <b>who states an uncertain</b> claim? <b>If we say that</b> it is <b>the injured</b> party who <b>states</b> with <b>a certain</b> claim that the large ox caused the injury, <b>and</b> it is <b>the one liable for damage</b> who <b>states an uncertain claim</b> that it was the small one, <b>let us still say that</b> the mishna <b>is a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba bar Natan,</b> since the defendant does not admit to the claim of the injured party, and nevertheless he is liable to pay compensation from the small one.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be a case <b>where the injured</b> party <b>states an uncertain</b> claim that it was the large ox that caused the injury, <b>and the one liable for damage states a certain</b> claim that it was the small one. Since the claimant does not contradict the defendant’s admission, the latter is liable to pay the amount that he admitted he owes.
The Gemara notes: <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the mishna is referring to a case where <b>the injured</b> party states <b>an uncertain</b> claim <b>and the one liable for damage</b> states <b>a certain</b> claim, it may be inferred that <b>the first clause</b> is <b>also</b> referring to a case where <b>the injured</b> party states <b>an uncertain</b> claim that it was the defendant’s ox that injured his ox, <b>and the one liable for damage</b> states <b>a certain</b> claim that it was injured by a stone. It is not referring to a case of two certain claims as inferred above.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Sumakhos state</b> his ruling that the disputed property is divided between the two parties <b>even with regard to this</b> case, where the claimant states an uncertain claim, so <b>that it was necessary</b> for the mishna <b>to teach us that</b> according to the other Rabbis it is <b>not</b> divided? Certainly Sumakhos would concede that in this case the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.
The Gemara answers: <b>No;</b> although <b>the latter clause</b> is referring to a case where <b>the injured</b> party states <b>an uncertain</b> claim <b>and the one liable for damage</b> states <b>a certain</b> claim, <b>the first clause</b> is referring to a case where <b>the injured</b> party states <b>a certain</b> claim <b>and the one liable for damage</b> states <b>an uncertain</b> claim. It is with regard to this case that the Rabbis disagree with the opinion of Sumakhos that the property is divided.
The Gemara questions this interpretation: <b>But</b> according to this interpretation, <b>the first clause is not similar to the last clause.</b> Why not explain the first clause as referring to a case of two certain claims?
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: A case of <b>a certain</b> claim <b>and an uncertain</b> claim, and a case of <b>an uncertain</b> claim <b>and a certain</b> claim, <b>are one matter.</b> Therefore, the two clauses are congruent. By contrast, a case of <b>a certain</b> claim <b>and a certain</b> claim, and a case of <b>an uncertain</b> claim <b>and a certain</b> claim, <b>are two matters.</b> Therefore, the first clause of the mishna cannot be referring to a case of two certain claims.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself</b> that was mentioned above. <b>Rabba bar Natan says:</b> If one <b>claims</b> that another owes him <b>wheat, and</b> the other <b>concedes</b> that he owes <b>him barley,</b> the latter is <b>exempt</b> from payment. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> novel element <b>is</b> this <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learned</b> it in a mishna: If one <b>claims</b> that another owes him <b>wheat, and</b> the other <b>concedes</b> that he owes <b>him barley,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> (<i>Shevuot</i> 38b).
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it had been taught only <b>from there, I would say</b> the mishna means that he is <b>exempt from</b> payment of <b>the value of the wheat but liable to</b> pay <b>the value of the barley,</b> which he conceded that he owes. Therefore, Rabba bar Natan <b>teaches us that</b> the mishna means that he is <b>completely exempt,</b> even from paying for the barley.
The Gemara raises an objection to this statement: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna here that if the <b>injured</b> animals <b>were two</b> oxen, <b>one large and</b> the other <b>one small,</b> and the ones that caused the damage were also two oxen, one large and one small, and the injured party claims that the large one injured the large one, and the small one injured the small one, and the liable party claims that the small one injured the large one, and the large one injured the small one, the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. This indicates that <b>if</b> the injured party <b>does not bring proof</b> for his claim, <b>he takes</b> compensation <b>according to what the one liable for damage says.</b> According to Rabba bar Natan’s statement, <b>why</b> does he receive compensation at all? The case <b>is</b> parallel to the case of <b>wheat and barley,</b> and the defendant should be entirely exempt.
The Gemara answers: The mishna does not indicate that the injured party receives compensation, rather, that <b>it is fitting for him to take</b> compensation. <b>But</b> in practice <b>he does not</b> receive any compensation.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the injured party <b>receives payment for</b> his <b>small ox from the</b> liable party’s <b>large</b> ox, <b>and for</b> his <b>large</b> ox <b>from the</b> liable party’s <b>small</b> ox? Evidently he does receive payment.
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the injured party <b>seized</b> the defendant’s ox, in which case the court allows it to remain in his possession, since his taking it was appropriate, although the court cannot compel the defendant to pay him <i>ab initio</i>.
The Gemara raises an objection to Rabba bar Natan’s statement from the last clause of the mishna as well: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that if <b>one</b> of the belligerent oxen <b>was innocuous and</b> the other <b>one</b> was <b>forewarned,</b> and <b>the injured</b> party <b>says:</b> The <b>forewarned</b> ox <b>injured the large one and</b> the <b>innocuous</b> ox injured <b>the small one, and the one liable for damage says: No; rather,</b> the <b>innocuous</b> ox injured <b>the large one and</b> the <b>forewarned</b> ox injured <b>the small one,</b> in this case, <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b> This indicates that <b>if he does not bring proof</b> for his claim, <b>he takes</b> compensation <b>according to what the one liable for damage says. Why</b> does he receive compensation at all? The case <b>is</b> parallel to the case of <b>wheat and barley.</b>

Daf 36a

The Gemara answers: The mishna does not indicate that the injured party receives compensation. Rather, it indicates that <b>it is fitting for him to take</b> compensation, <b>but</b> in practice <b>he does not</b> receive any compensation. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>he receives payment for</b> his <b>small ox from the</b> liable party’s <b>forewarned</b> ox, <b>and for</b> his <b>large</b> ox <b>from the</b> liable party’s <b>innocuous</b> ox? Evidently he does receive payment. The Gemara answers: This <i>baraita</i> is also referring to a case <b>where</b> the injured party <b>seized</b> the defendant’s ox, in which case the court allows it to remain in his possession. The court cannot compel the defendant to pay him <i>ab initio</i>.
§ The mishna teaches: In a case where an ox was injured by one of two oxen that were pursuing it, if <b>both</b> oxen <b>belonged to one person, both are liable. Rava of Parzika said to Rav Ashi:</b> Should one <b>learn from</b> the fact that both are liable that in a case of <b>innocuous oxen that caused damage,</b> if the injured party <b>wishes,</b> he can <b>collect</b> damages <b>from</b> the proceeds from the sale of <b>this</b> ox, and if <b>he wishes,</b> he can <b>collect from</b> the sale of <b>that</b> ox?
Rav Ashi rejected this inference: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with forewarned</b> oxen, in which case the injured party does not collect damages exclusively from the belligerent ox but rather from any of its owner’s property. Therefore, he can collect from either ox as compensation.
Rava of Parzika replied: <b>If</b> the mishna is referring <b>to forewarned</b> oxen, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If <b>one</b> of the belligerent oxen <b>was large and</b> the other <b>one</b> was <b>small,</b> and <b>the injured</b> party <b>says</b> that <b>the large</b> ox <b>caused the damage, but the one liable for damage says: No; rather, the small</b> ox <b>caused the damage, the burden of proof rests upon the claimant. If</b> this is referring <b>to forewarned</b> oxen, <b>what difference does it make to him</b> which one caused the injury? <b>Ultimately,</b> the liable party <b>is required to pay</b> the <b>value of a full ox</b> in any case.
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: The latter clause</b> of the mishna is referring <b>to innocuous</b> oxen, <b>and the first clause</b> is referring <b>to forewarned</b> oxen.
<b>Rav Aḥa the Elder said to Rav Ashi: If</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>forewarned</b> oxen, where compensation is not collected specifically from the belligerent ox, why does the mishna state: <b>They are liable,</b> in the plural form? <b>It should have</b> stated: The <b>man is liable. And furthermore, what</b> is the word <b>both</b> in the statement: Both are liable, referring to?
<b>Rather,</b> the first clause of the mishna is <b>actually</b> referring <b>to innocuous</b> oxen, <b>and it is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that the injured party and the liable party <b>are partners,</b> as they share ownership of the belligerent ox. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>the reason</b> that the owner of the belligerent oxen is liable is that <b>the two of them are</b> available, <b>so he cannot dismiss</b> the injured party by claiming that this ox is not the one that caused the injury. <b>But</b> if <b>the two of them are not</b> available, e.g., if one died or was lost, <b>he can say to</b> the injured party: <b>Go bring proof that</b> it was <b>this ox</b> that <b>caused you damage, and I will pay you</b> compensation.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to an innocuous <b>ox that gored four or five</b> other <b>oxen one after the other,</b> its owner <b>shall pay</b> the owner of <b>the last</b> one <b>of them</b> half of the damages from the proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox; <b>and if there is surplus</b> value left <b>in</b> his ox after he pays that owner, <b>he shall return</b> it <b>to</b> the owner of <b>the previous</b> ox that was gored; <b>and if there is</b> still <b>surplus</b> value left <b>in</b> his ox after he pays that owner, <b>he shall return</b> it <b>to the</b> one <b>prior to the previous</b> one. The principle is that the owner of <b>the latest</b> of the oxen gored in succession <b>gains.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the division of the compensation is as follows: With regard to an innocuous <b>ox worth two hundred</b> dinars <b>that gored an ox worth two hundred</b> dinars, thereby killing it, <b>and the carcass is worthless,</b> the injured party <b>takes one hundred dinars,</b> i.e., half the cost of the damage, from the proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox, <b>and</b> the owner of the belligerent ox <b>takes</b> the remaining <b>one hundred dinars.</b>
If the ox, after goring the first ox but before compensation had been paid, <b>again gored another ox worth two hundred</b> dinars, and the carcass is worthless, the owner of <b>the last</b> ox that was gored <b>takes one hundred dinars, and</b> with regard to payment for <b>the previous</b> goring, the owner of <b>this</b> ox that was gored <b>takes fifty dinars,</b> which is half the remaining value of the belligerent ox after one hundred dinars were paid to the last injured party, <b>and</b> the owner of <b>that</b> belligerent ox <b>takes</b> the remaining <b>fifty dinars.</b>
If the ox, after goring the first two oxen but before compensation had been paid, again <b>gored another ox worth two hundred</b> dinars, and the carcass is worthless, <b>the last</b> injured party <b>takes one hundred dinars, the previous one</b> takes <b>fifty dinars, and the first two,</b> i.e., the first injured party and the owner of the belligerent ox, divide the remainder, each receiving <b>one gold dinar,</b> which is worth twenty-five silver dinars.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in the <b>mishna?</b> Apparently the mishna is <b>neither in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, nor in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> (see 33a).
The Gemara explains: <b>If</b> the mishna had been <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says</b> that the owners of the gored oxen <b>are</b> considered <b>creditors</b> of the owner of the belligerent ox, then instead of stating <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> that the owner of <b>the latest</b> of the oxen gored in succession <b>gains,</b> the mishna <b>should have</b> stated that the owner of <b>the earliest</b> of the oxen gored in succession <b>gains,</b> since the creditor to whom the ox is initially liened collects first. And <b>if</b> the mishna had been <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>the</b> belligerent <b>ox belongs to</b> its owner and to the injured party, who are considered <b>partners</b> in the ownership of the ox, then instead of stating <b>this</b> ruling that <b>if there is surplus</b> value remaining in the ox after he pays that owner

Daf 36b

<b>he shall return</b> it <b>to the</b> owner of the <b>previous</b> ox, the mishna <b>should have</b> ruled that the surplus shall be returned <b>to all of them,</b> i.e., all the prior injured parties, since they all share joint ownership of the belligerent ox.
<b>Rava said: Actually,</b> the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, who says</b> that all the injured parties <b>are creditors. And as for the difficulty you</b> pose, that instead of stating that the owner of <b>the latest</b> of the oxen gored in succession <b>gains,</b> the mishna <b>should have</b> stated that the owner of <b>the earliest</b> of the oxen gored in succession <b>gains,</b> that can be answered. <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where the</b> first <b>injured</b> party <b>seized</b> the ox <b>to collect</b> payment <b>from it, and</b> consequently <b>became like a paid bailee</b> with regard <b>to damage</b> it causes. Therefore, he is responsible for any subsequent attacks by the ox. Similarly, if the next injured party seizes the ox from the first as compensation, he becomes responsible for any subsequent attacks.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> instead of the mishna stating that <b>if there is surplus</b> value left <b>in</b> his ox after he pays that owner, <b>he shall return</b> it <b>to</b> the owner of <b>the previous</b> ox that was gored, <b>it should have</b> stated that <b>he shall return it to</b> its <b>owner,</b> since half the value of the belligerent ox belongs to its owner, who is not responsible for any later damage it causes.
<b>Ravina said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is teaching: If there is surplus</b> value <b>with regard to its damages,</b> i.e., the latter injured party sustained less of a loss than the previous one, that injured party <b>shall return</b> this surplus value <b>to the previous</b> injured party.
<b>Similarly, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he related that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The mishna <b>touched on this</b> topic <b>with regard to a bailee’s negligence.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with which</b> opinion <b>did you interpret</b> the ruling in the mishna? Was it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael? If so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that the division of the compensation is as follows: With regard to an innocuous <b>ox worth two hundred</b> dinars <b>that gored an ox worth two hundred</b> dinars, thereby killing it, <b>and the carcass is worthless,</b> the injured party <b>takes one hundred dinars</b> from the proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox, <b>and</b> the owner of the belligerent ox <b>takes</b> the remaining <b>one hundred dinars.</b>
If the ox, after goring the first ox but before compensation had been paid, <b>again gored another ox worth two hundred</b> dinars, and the carcass is worthless, the owner of <b>the last</b> ox that was gored <b>takes one hundred dinars; and</b> with regard to payment for <b>the previous</b> goring, the owner of <b>this</b> ox that was gored <b>takes fifty dinars,</b> which is half the remaining value of the belligerent ox after one hundred dinars were paid to the last injured party, <b>and</b> the owner of <b>that</b> belligerent ox <b>takes</b> the remaining <b>fifty dinars.</b> If the ox, after goring the first two oxen but before compensation had been paid, again <b>gored another ox worth two hundred</b> dinars, and the carcass is worthless, <b>the last</b> injured party <b>takes one hundred dinars, the previous one</b> takes <b>fifty dinars, and the first two</b> divide the remainder, each receiving <b>one gold dinar,</b> which is worth twenty-five silver dinars.
The Gemara continues: In the ruling of Rabbi Shimon, <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>the ox belongs to</b> its owner and to the injured party, who are considered <b>partners</b> in the ownership of the ox. Is it possible that <b>the first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael and the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva?</b>
The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>yes,</b> this is the case, <b>as Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: <i>Shinnana</i>, leave</b> the presumption that <b>the</b> entire <b>mishna</b> follows one opinion <b>and follow my</b> interpretation: <b>The first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael and the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>
<b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The practical difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon in the mishna is with regard to a case where <b>the injured</b> party <b>consecrated</b> the ox. If he is a partner in the ownership of the ox, his consecration takes effect; if he is considered merely a creditor, the consecration is ineffective. Evidently, Rabbi Yoḥanan also holds that the dispute in the mishna corresponds to the dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva.
§ With regard to the gold dinar mentioned in the mishna, <b>we learned</b> in another mishna <b>there</b> (90a): <b>One who slaps [<i>hatokea</i>] another</b> is liable to <b>give him a <i>sela</i></b> as a compensatory fine. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili:</b> He is liable to give him <b>one hundred dinars.</b>
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who slapped another. Rav Toviya bar Mattana sent</b> an enquiry <b>before Rav Yosef,</b> asking him whether the <i>sela</i> <b>we learned</b> about in the mishna is referring to <b>a Tyrian <i>sela</i>,</b> which is worth four dinars, <b>or</b> whether the <i>sela</i> <b>we learned</b> about in the mishna is referring to <b>a provincial <i>sela</i>,</b> worth only half of a dinar, or one-eighth of a Tyrian <i>sela</i>.
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: You learned this</b> in a mishna: <b>And the first two</b> divide the remainder, each receiving <b>one gold dinar,</b> worth twenty-five silver dinars. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>the <i>tanna</i> teaches</b> monetary sums using <b>a provincial <i>sela</i></b> in order to calculate compensation, <b>let him</b> further <b>divide</b> the value that the first two litigants receive <b>and teach</b> a case where the belligerent ox gored an additional ox, so that their shares decrease <b>until</b> they reach <b>twelve dinars and one <i>sela</i></b> apiece, which are twelve and a half dinars. The fact that he does not do so indicates that the mishna does not use a provincial <i>sela</i>, whose value is less than one dinar, and therefore a gold dinar cannot be divided in a manner that leaves each party with whole coins.
Rav Toviya bar Mattana <b>said to him:</b> This is not proof; <b>should the <i>tanna</i> have continued teaching</b> additional cases, exhausting all possibilities, <b>like a peddler</b> selling his wares, who advertises every item of his merchandise? The cases cited in the mishna suffice to illustrate the point.
<b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? The Sages <b>resolved it based on</b> that <b>which Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: All</b> references to <b>coinage mentioned in the Torah</b> refer to <b>Tyrian coinage, whereas</b> all mentions <b>of</b> coinage in the <b>statements of</b> the Sages refer to <b>provincial coinage.</b> Therefore, a person who slaps another is fined a provincial <i>sela</i>, worth half of a dinar.
Following the verdict, <b>that man</b> who was slapped <b>said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Since</b> the fine <b>is</b> only <b>half a dinar, I do not want it,</b> as it is beneath me to collect such an amount. Instead, <b>let him give it to the poor. Then</b> he retracted his decision, and <b>said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Let him give it to me, and I will go and sustain [<i>ve’avri</i>] myself with it.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef said to him:</b> Since you already committed to give it to charity, <b>the poor have already acquired it</b> and it now belongs to them. <b>And although there are no poor</b> people <b>here</b> to acquire it, <b>we,</b> the court, <b>are the hand,</b> i.e., the legal extension, <b>of the poor.</b> We represent them, <b>as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Orphans</b>

Daf 37a

<b>do not require a document that prevents the Sabbatical Year from abrogating an outstanding debt [<i>prosbol</i>]</b> by transferring the right of collection to the court. The reason that orphans do not require this document is because the court is legally considered to be their steward, and their debts are therefore transferred to the court automatically, even without a <i>prosbol</i>.
<b>Similarly, Rami bar Ḥama taught: Orphans do not require a <i>prosbol</i>,</b> as <b>Rabban Gamliel and his court were</b> tantamount to <b>the fathers of orphans,</b> as they were vigilant to collect all of the debts owed to orphans. Subsequently, the courts in every generation have this status.
The Gemara relates: <b>Ḥanan the wicked slapped a certain man. He</b> then <b>came before Rav Huna</b> for judgment. Rav Huna <b>said to him: Go give him a half-dinar,</b> which is the fine imposed for such an act. Ḥanan the wicked <b>had a clipped dinar,</b> and <b>wanted to give him a half-dinar from it,</b> but <b>there was no one</b> who wanted <b>to take it</b> from him to give him smaller coins for it. Ḥanan the wicked then <b>gave him another slap,</b> rendering himself liable to pay an additional fine of half a dinar, <b>and gave him</b> the clipped dinar as payment.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an ox that is forewarned with regard to its</b> own <b>species,</b> as it already gored other oxen three times, <b>but is not forewarned with regard to other species;</b> or an ox that is <b>forewarned with regard to people, but is not forewarned with regard to animals;</b> or one that is <b>forewarned with regard to small</b> specimens of a species, <b>but is not forewarned with regard to large</b> specimens of that species; in all these cases, if the ox gores the type of animal or person <b>with regard to which it is forewarned,</b> its owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage, and</b> if it gores an animal or person <b>with regard to which it is not forewarned, he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
The Sages <b>said before Rabbi Yehuda:</b> What would be the <i>halakha</i> if <b>this</b> ox <b>is forewarned with regard to <i>Shabbatot</i> but is not forewarned with regard to weekdays? He said to them: For</b> damage it causes on <b><i>Shabbatot</i></b> its owner <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage, and for</b> damage it causes on <b>weekdays, he pays half</b> the cost of the <b>damage.</b>
<b>When is it</b> rendered <b>innocuous</b> again after being forewarned with regard to Shabbat? It reverts to its innocuous status <b>when</b> its behavior <b>reverts</b> to normal, i.e., when it refrains from goring for <b>three days of Shabbat,</b> i.e., Shabbat in three successive weeks.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rav Zevid said:</b> The version of the mishna that <b>we learned</b> states: With regard to an ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <b>but is not forewarned</b> with regard to other species, referring to an ox that is proven to be innocuous with regard to other species, if it gores another species, its owner pays only half the cost of the damage. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The version of the mishna that <b>we learned</b> states: An ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <b>is not forewarned</b> with regard to other species. Accordingly, the mishna is teaching that the fact that it is forewarned with regard to goring one species does not render it forewarned with regard to goring other species, until it is proven otherwise.
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Zevid said</b> that the version of the mishna that <b>we learned</b> states: With regard to an ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <b>but is not forewarned</b> with regard to other species, indicating that it is referring specifically to an ox that is proven to be innocuous with regard to other species. This implies that in <b>an ordinary</b> case, where there is no such proof, the ox <b>is</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard to all species. <b>Rav Pappa,</b> by contrast, <b>said</b> that the version of the mishna that <b>we learned</b> states: An ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <b>is not forewarned</b> with regard to other species, meaning <b>that</b> in <b>an ordinary</b> case, the ox <b>is not</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard to other species.
<b>Rav Zevid inferred</b> his opinion <b>from the latter clause</b> of the mishna, whereas <b>Rav Pappa inferred</b> his opinion <b>from the former clause.</b>
<b>Rav Zevid inferred</b> his opinion <b>from the latter clause, as it teaches:</b> An ox that is <b>forewarned with regard to small</b> specimens of a species, <b>but is not forewarned with regard to large</b> specimens of that species. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the mishna <b>teaches</b> in the first clause: With regard to an ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <b>but is not forewarned</b> with regard to other species, indicating that in <b>an ordinary</b> case the ox <b>is</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard to all animals, <b>this</b> clause of the mishna <b>teaches us that even from</b> being forewarned with regard to <b>small</b> specimens of a species, in <b>an ordinary</b> case the ox <b>is</b> thereby considered <b>forewarned with regard to large</b> specimens of that species, which is a more far-reaching statement, as an ox is less likely to gore large animals.
<b>But if you say</b> that the mishna <b>teaches:</b> An ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <b>is not forewarned</b> with regard to other species, meaning that in <b>an ordinary</b> case, where there is no proof to the contrary, the ox <b>is not</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard to other species, there is a difficulty with the latter clause of the mishna.
The Gemara explains: <b>Now</b> that <b>it can be said</b> that <b>from</b> being forewarned with regard to <b>small</b> oxen, in <b>an ordinary</b> case, the ox <b>is not</b> thereby considered <b>forewarned with regard to small</b> animals <b>in general, need it be said that from</b> being forewarned with regard to <b>small</b> specimens of a species <b>it is not</b> thereby considered <b>forewarned with regard to large</b> specimens of that species? It must be that the mishna reads: But is not forewarned, indicating that only when the ox is proven to be innocuous with regard to other species and then it gores another species is its owner liable to pay only half the cost of the damage. Otherwise, he must pay the full cost of the damage.
<b>And Rav Pappa</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response that even if the mishna reads: An ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <b>is not forewarned</b> with regard to other species, the latter clause is <b>necessary,</b> as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it breached</b> the norm by attacking one <b>of that species, it</b> is considered to have <b>breached</b> the norm entirely <b>with regard to</b> that species, and there <b>is no difference</b> with regard to <b>large</b> members <b>of</b> the species <b>and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> with regard to <b>small</b> members <b>of it,</b> as the ox is now likely to gore any of them. Therefore, this clause of the mishna <b>teaches us that it is not</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard to the large animals of that species.
As stated previously, <b>Rav Pappa inferred</b> his opinion <b>from the former clause</b> of the mishna. <b>As</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> An ox that is <b>forewarned with regard to people is not forewarned with regard to animals. Granted, if you say</b> that <b>we learned</b> that the mishna states: An ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <b>is not forewarned</b> with regard to other species, which would indicate that in <b>an ordinary</b> case, where there is no proof to the contrary, <b>it is not</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard to other species, then the mishna, in the next clause, <b>teaches us this, that even from</b> being forewarned with regard to <b>people,</b> in <b>an ordinary</b> case, the ox <b>is not</b> considered <b>forewarned with regard to animals.</b> The ox is considered innocuous with regard to animals, although it is more common for an ox to gore an animal than a person.
<b>But if you say that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> in the first clause: With regard to an ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <b>but is not forewarned</b> with regard to other species, indicating that in <b>an ordinary</b> case <b>it is</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard to other species, then there is a difficulty with the following clause of the mishna. <b>Now</b> that <b>it can be said</b> that even <b>from</b> being forewarned with regard to one species of <b>animal,</b> in <b>an ordinary</b> case, <b>it is</b> thereby considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard <b>to</b> other species of <b>animals, need it be said that from</b> its being forewarned with regard to <b>people it is</b> also considered <b>forewarned with regard to animals?</b>
<b>And Rav Zevid</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response: <b>The former clause</b> in the mishna <b>relates to</b> the ox <b>reverting</b> to its innocuous status, i.e., a case <b>where</b> the ox <b>was forewarned with regard to man and forewarned with regard to animals, and reverted</b> to its innocuous status <b>with regard to animals, as it stood in</b> close <b>proximity to an animal three times and did not gore. Lest you say</b> that <b>since it did not</b> demonstratively <b>revert to</b> its innocuous behavior toward <b>people,</b> as it did not refrain from goring people, its <b>reversal with regard to animals is not</b> considered <b>a reversal,</b> the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> its <b>reversal with regard to animals is nevertheless</b> considered <b>a reversal,</b> and it no longer has the status of a forewarned ox with regard to goring animals.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Zevid’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Sumakhos says:</b> An ox that is <b>forewarned with regard to people is</b> considered <b>forewarned with regard to animals, due to an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If it is forewarned with regard to people,</b> is it <b>not</b> clear <b>all the more so</b> that it is forewarned <b>with regard to animals?</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>By inference, the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna, <b>is saying</b> that the ox <b>is not</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard to animals, in accordance with the opinion of Rav Pappa.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Zevid</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>Sumakhos’s</b> statement can be interpreted as <b>relating to</b> the ox <b>reverting</b> to its innocuous status, <b>and this is</b> what he <b>is saying to the first <i>tanna</i>:</b> Contrary to <b>what you are saying,</b> that the ox’s <b>reversal with regard to animals is considered a reversal</b> although it has not yet reversed its behavior toward people, I maintain that its <b>reversal with regard to animals is not</b> considered <b>a reversal, due to an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of an animal forewarned with regard to <b>people: If</b> the ox <b>has not reverted to</b> its innocuous behavior toward <b>people,</b> is it <b>not</b> clear <b>all the more so</b> that it has not truly reverted <b>to</b> its innocuous behavior toward <b>animals?</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for Rav Zevid’s opinion from the mishna: The Sages <b>said before Rabbi Yehuda:</b> What would be the <i>halakha</i> if <b>this</b> ox <b>is forewarned with regard to <i>Shabbatot</i> but is not forewarned with regard to weekdays? He said to them: For</b> damage it causes on <b><i>Shabbatot</i></b> its owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage,</b> and <b>for</b> damage it causes on <b>weekdays, he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that the mishna <b>teaches: But was not forewarned</b> with regard to weekdays, <b>they were asking him</b> about the <i>halakha</i> in that case, <b>and likewise, he was answering them</b> with a ruling. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>it teaches:</b> This ox that is forewarned with regard to <i>Shabbatot</i> <b>is not forewarned</b> with regard to weekdays, the mishna would be understood as saying that an ox that is forewarned with regard to Shabbat is not considered forewarned with regard to weekdays. Is it possible that the Sages <b>were teaching him</b> this <i>halakha</i>? <b>And furthermore, what was he responding to them?</b> They had already stated themselves that the ox is not considered forewarned with regard to weekdays.
<b>Rav Yannai said:</b> Rav Zevid’s opinion <b>can be inferred from the former clause</b> of the mishna <b>as well, as it teaches:</b> If the ox gores an animal or person <b>with regard to which it is forewarned,</b> its owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage, and</b> if it gores an animal or person <b>with regard to which it is not forewarned, he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that the mishna <b>teaches</b> in the first clause: With regard to an ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <b>but is not forewarned</b> with regard to other species, this clause <b>is explaining</b> the <i>halakha</i> in that case, i.e., if the ox is forewarned only with regard to its species, its owner is liable to pay the full cost of the damage only if it gores another ox.
<b>But if you say</b> that the mishna <b>teaches:</b> An ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species <b>is not forewarned</b> with regard to other species, and the <i>halakha</i> was already <b>determined</b> at the beginning of the mishna, namely, that the ox is not considered forewarned with regard to other species, then <b>what</b> need is there for the mishna to <b>further</b> state: If the ox gores an animal or person <b>with regard to which it is forewarned,</b> its owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage, and</b> if it gores an animal or person <b>with regard to which it is not forewarned, he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage? Has</b> the mishna <b>not taught us until now that for an innocuous</b> ox its owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage and for a forewarned</b> ox <b>he pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage?</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And even if you say</b> that <b>Rav Pappa’s</b> opinion, which says that an ox that is forewarned with regard to its own species is not considered forewarned with regard to other species, <b>is accepted,</b> nevertheless, if an ox <b>gored an ox, a donkey, and a camel, it is</b> thereby <b>rendered forewarned</b> with regard <b>to all</b> of them. The ox is rendered forewarned with regard to all three species, regardless of the fact that it did not gore each individual species three times.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> If an ox <b>saw an ox</b> and <b>gored</b> it, and subsequently saw another <b>ox</b> but <b>did not gore</b> it, again saw <b>an ox</b> and <b>gored</b> it and then saw <b>an ox</b> but <b>did not gore</b> it, and a third time saw <b>an ox</b> and <b>gored</b> it and saw <b>an ox</b> and <b>did not gore</b> it, in this case <b>it is rendered forewarned with regard to alternate oxen.</b> The ox is considered forewarned with regard to goring every other ox that it sees and is considered innocuous with regard to the oxen in between. If it then gores two oxen in a row, the owner of the ox is liable for only half the cost of the damage for the second ox.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If an ox <b>saw an ox</b> and <b>gored</b> it, and then saw <b>a donkey</b> but <b>did not gore</b> it, and saw <b>a horse</b> and <b>gored</b> it, then saw <b>a camel</b> and <b>did not gore</b> it, and saw <b>a mule</b> and <b>gored</b> it, and then saw <b>a wild donkey [<i>arod</i>]</b> and <b>did not gore</b> it, in this case it <b>is rendered forewarned</b> with regard <b>to alternate</b> animals of <b>all</b> species.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If an ox <b>gored</b>

Daf 37b

<b>an ox,</b> another <b>ox, and</b> a third <b>ox,</b> and then <b>a donkey and a camel,</b> with regard to <b>what is</b> it considered forewarned?
The Gemara presents the possibilities: With regard to <b>this last ox</b> that was gored together with the donkey and the camel, <b>do we place it</b> together <b>with</b> the previously gored <b>oxen, and</b> accordingly the belligerent ox <b>was still rendered forewarned</b> only <b>with regard to oxen,</b> whereas <b>with regard to other</b> species it <b>was not rendered forewarned? Or perhaps we place this last ox</b> together <b>with the donkey and the camel, and it was rendered forewarned with regard to all of the species</b> it gored.
The Gemara adds a similar dilemma: If an ox gored <b>a donkey and a camel,</b> and then <b>an ox, an ox, and</b> another <b>ox, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara presents the possibilities: With regard to <b>this first ox</b> that it gored, <b>do we place it</b> together <b>with the camel and donkey, and</b> the belligerent ox <b>was</b> accordingly <b>rendered forewarned with regard to all species? Or perhaps we place it</b> together <b>with the</b> two <b>oxen</b> that it gored afterward, <b>and</b> accordingly, <b>it was still rendered forewarned</b> only <b>with regard to oxen,</b> whereas <b>it was not rendered forewarned with regard to other species.</b>
Similarly, if it gored on <b>Shabbat,</b> on <b>Shabbat, and</b> on <b>Shabbat,</b> i.e., on three consecutive <i>Shabbatot</i>, and then on <b>Sunday and</b> on <b>Monday, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? With regard to <b>this last Shabbat, do we place it</b> together <b>with</b> the previous <b>Shabbat, and</b> the ox <b>was still rendered forewarned</b> only <b>with regard to Shabbat,</b> whereas <b>with regard to weekdays it was not rendered forewarned? Or perhaps we place it</b> together <b>with</b> the goring on <b>Sunday and Monday, and it was</b> thereby <b>rendered forewarned with regard to all days</b> of the week.
If an ox gored on <b>Thursday, and Friday, and Shabbat,</b> and then the next <b>Shabbat and</b> the next <b>Shabbat</b> after that, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? With regard to <b>this first Shabbat, do we place it</b> together <b>with Thursday and Friday, and</b> thereby hold that the ox <b>was rendered forewarned with regard to all days</b> of the week? <b>Or perhaps we place this first Shabbat</b> together <b>with</b> the other <b><i>Shabbatot</i>, and</b> the ox <b>is rendered forewarned only with regard to <i>Shabbatot</i>?</b>
These dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ If <b>an ox gored</b> on <b>the fifteenth day of this month, and</b> subsequently gored on <b>the sixteenth day of</b> the <b>month</b> after <b>that, and</b> then on <b>the seventeenth</b> day <b>of</b> the <b>month</b> after <b>that,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is subject to <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> with regard to a parallel discussion concerning a woman whose menstrual cycle begins on a different day each month.
<b>As it was stated:</b> If a woman <b>saw</b> menstrual blood on <b>the fifteenth day of this month, and</b> on <b>the sixteenth day of</b> the <b>month</b> after <b>that, and</b> on <b>the seventeenth</b> day <b>of</b> the <b>month</b> after <b>that, Rav says: She has</b> thereby <b>established her menstrual cycle [<i>veset</i>],</b> i.e., a month and one day. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> Her menstrual cycle is not established <b>until she skips</b> a day <b>three times.</b> According to Shmuel, the cycle is established in this case not by the date per se, but rather by the pattern of one additional day every month. Only when this occurs for three consecutive months, i.e., when she menstruates in the fourth month, is this pattern established.
§ <b>Rava said:</b> If an ox <b>heard the sound of a shofar and gored,</b> and again heard <b>the sound of a shofar and gored,</b> and a third time heard <b>the sound of a shofar and gored, it is rendered forewarned with regard to</b> the sound of <b><i>shofarot</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t this obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>this first shofar merely startled [<i>siyyuta</i>]</b> the ox, prompting it to gore, and that consequently it should not count for the purpose of rendering the ox forewarned, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that since the ox repeatedly gored upon hearing the sound of a shofar, this sound is considered a consistent impetus for its goring.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an ox of a Jew that gored a consecrated ox, and</b> conversely, <b>a consecrated</b> ox <b>that gored a non-sacred ox,</b> i.e., an ox owned by a Jew, the owner of the ox is <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And if one man’s ox hurts <b>the ox of another”</b> (Exodus 21:35). It is derived from the phrase “the ox of another” that one is liable only if it is a non-sacred ox, <b>but not</b> if it is <b>a consecrated ox,</b> which belongs to the Temple treasury, regardless of whether the latter was the ox that gored or the ox that was gored.
With regard to <b>an ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a gentile,</b> the owner of the belligerent ox is <b>exempt</b> from liability. <b>But</b> with regard to an ox <b>of a gentile that gored the ox of a Jew,</b> regardless of <b>whether</b> the goring ox was <b>innocuous or forewarned,</b> the owner of the ox <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a non-sacred ox that gored a consecrated ox, or a consecrated</b> ox <b>that gored a non-sacred ox,</b> the owner of the ox is <b>exempt</b> from liability, <b>as it is stated: “The ox of another,”</b> indicating: <b>But not a consecrated ox. Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says:</b> With regard to <b>a consecrated ox that gored a non-sacred ox,</b> the Temple treasury is <b>exempt</b> from liability; <b>but</b> with regard to <b>a non-sacred</b> ox <b>that gored a consecrated ox, whether</b> it was <b>innocuous or forewarned,</b> the owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
The Sages <b>said: What does Rabbi Shimon</b> ben Menasya <b>hold?</b> Why does he distinguish between a consecrated ox that gored a non-sacred ox and a non-sacred ox that gored a consecrated ox? <b>If</b> the phrase <b>“of another”</b> is meant in <b>a precise</b> manner, then <b>even</b> with regard to <b>a non-sacred</b> ox <b>that gored a consecrated ox</b> the owner of the belligerant ox <b>should be exempt</b> from liability, as the victim is not the ox of another, but belongs to the Temple treasury. <b>And if</b> the phrase <b>“of another”</b> is <b>not</b> meant in <b>a precise</b> manner, but rather, includes all oxen, then <b>a consecrated</b> ox <b>that gored a non-sacred</b> ox <b>should render</b> the Temple treasury <b>liable as well.</b>
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>actually</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya <b>holds</b> that <b>“of another”</b> is meant in <b>a precise</b> manner, and accordingly, if a consecrated ox gores a non-sacred ox the Temple treasury is exempt from liability; <b>but nevertheless, when a non-sacred</b> ox <b>gores a consecrated</b> ox, <b>this is the reason</b> its owner <b>is liable: Because</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya <b>infers it <i>a fortiori</i> from</b> the case of <b>a non-sacred</b> ox, as follows: <b>If</b> in the case of <b>a non-sacred</b> ox <b>that gores</b> another <b>non-sacred</b> ox the owner of the belligerent ox <b>is liable,</b> is it <b>not</b> clear <b>all the more so that when it gores a consecrated</b> ox the owner of the ox <b>is liable?</b>
If this is Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya’s reasoning, then his ruling that the owner of the ox pays the Temple treasury the full cost of the damage, whether his ox was innocuous or forewarned, is problematic, as <b>it is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source.</b> In other words, a <i>halakha</i> derived by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference cannot be more stringent than the <i>halakha</i> of the source from which it is derived. Therefore, <b>just as there,</b> in a case where an individual’s <b>innocuous</b> non-sacred ox gores another non-sacred ox, the owner pays only <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage, here too,</b> if an innocuous non-sacred ox gores a consecrated ox, its owner should be liable to pay only <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
<b>Rather, Reish Lakish said</b> that Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya’s reasoning is as follows: In principle, <b>all</b> cases of damage <b>were included</b> among those <b>in</b> which the owner pays the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b> The <i>halakha</i> that in a case of an innocuous ox the owner pays only half the cost of the damage is an exception to the rule, and <b>when the verse specified</b> the term <b>“of another” with regard to an innocuous</b> ox, it intended <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> specifically when one’s <b>innocuous</b> ox gores the ox of <b>another</b> that the owner <b>pays</b> only <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b> And <b>by inference,</b> if it gores <b>a consecrated</b> ox, <b>whether</b> the belligerent ox <b>is innocuous or forewarned</b> its owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>

Daf 38a

<b>Because if so,</b> if one whose ox gores a consecrated ox is exempt from liability, <b>let the verse write this</b> phrase: <b>“Of another,” with regard to</b> the case of <b>a forewarned</b> ox. One could then infer that the owner is exempt from liability in the case of an innocuous ox as well, as the liability with regard to an innocuous ox is less severe than with regard to a forewarned ox. The stating of this exemption specifically in the context of an innocuous ox indicates that the exemption is only concerning the leniency stated in the verse, that if the gored ox belongs to another person, the owner of the belligerent ox is liable to pay only half the cost of the damage.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>an ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a gentile,</b> the owner of the belligerent ox is <b>exempt</b> from liability; whereas if a gentile’s ox gores a Jew’s ox, the owner is liable to pay the full cost of the damage. The Sages <b>said:</b> This statement is difficult <b>whichever way you</b> look at it. <b>If</b> the phrase <b>“of another”</b> is meant in <b>a precise</b> manner, and therefore the liability applies only if his ox gores the ox of another Jew, <b>when a gentile’s</b> ox <b>gores that of a Jew he should also be exempt</b> from liability. <b>And if</b> the phrase <b>“of another”</b> is <b>not</b> meant in <b>a precise</b> manner, then <b>even when a Jew’s</b> ox <b>gores that of a gentile</b> the owner of the belligerent ox <b>should be liable.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that the reason for this ruling is that <b>the verse states: “He stood and shook the earth; He beheld, and made the nations tremble [<i>vayyatter</i>]”</b> (Habakkuk 3:6). This is homiletically interpreted to mean that God <b>saw the seven mitzvot that the descendants of Noah accepted upon themselves</b> to fulfill, and <b>since they did not fulfill</b> them, <b>He arose and permitted [<i>vehittir</i>] their money to the Jewish people,</b> so that in certain cases Jews are not liable for damage caused to gentiles.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that the source for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>from here:</b> It is stated in reference to the giving of the Torah: “The Lord came from Sinai and rose from Seir unto them; <b>He appeared from Mount Paran”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:2), which is homiletically interpreted to mean: <b>From</b> the time God came from Mount <b>Paran,</b> when giving the Torah, <b>the money of</b> the gentile nations <b>appeared,</b> i.e., it was revealed and granted <b>to the Jewish people.</b>
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a gentile,</b> the owner of the belligerent ox is <b>exempt</b> from liability. By contrast, with regard to <b>an ox of a gentile that gored the ox of a Jew, whether</b> it was <b>innocuous or forewarned,</b> the owner of the belligerent ox <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage, as it is stated: “He stood and shook the earth; He beheld, and made the nations tremble.” And</b> another verse <b>states: “He appeared from Mount Paran.”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the reason the <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And</b> another verse <b>states,</b> indicating that the first verse is not a sufficient source?
The Gemara explains that this is how the <i>baraita</i> is to be understood: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>this</b> verse: <b>“He stood and shook the earth” is necessary to</b> express <b>that which Rav Mattana and Rav Yosef</b> derived from the verse, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> another source: <b>“He appeared from Mount Paran,”</b> meaning: <b>From Paran their money appeared to the Jewish people. What is Rav Mattana’s</b> exposition? It is <b>as Rav Mattana says: “He stood and shook the earth.” What did He see? He saw the seven mitzvot that the descendants of Noah were commanded but did not fulfill,</b> and <b>He arose and exiled them from their land</b> on account of their transgressions.
<b>And from where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> term <b><i>vayyatter</i> is a term of exile? It is written here: “And made the nations tremble [<i>vayyatter</i>]”</b> (Habakkuk 3:6), <b>and it is written there: “<i>Lenatter</i> upon the earth”</b> (Leviticus 11:21), <b>which is translated</b> into Aramaic as: <b>“To leap upon the earth.”</b> Apparently, the root <i>nun</i>, <i>tav</i>, <i>reish</i>, common to both words, indicates uprooting from one place to another.
<b>What is Rav Yosef’s</b> exposition? It is <b>as Rav Yosef says: “He stood and shook the earth; He beheld.” What did He see? He saw the seven mitzvot that the descendants of Noah accepted upon themselves and did not fulfill,</b> so <b>He arose and permitted</b> their prohibitions <b>to them.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Did they</b> thereby <b>profit,</b> in that their prohibitions became permitted to them? <b>If so, we have found a transgressor</b> who <b>is rewarded. Mar, son of Rabbana, says:</b> This is not to say that for them to transgress their mitzvot is no longer a sin; rather, it is <b>to say that even if they fulfill them, they do not receive reward for</b> fulfilling <b>them.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> do they <b>not</b> receive reward for fulfilling those mitzvot? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that even a gentile who engages in Torah is</b> considered <b>like a High Priest? The verse states</b> with regard to the mitzvot: <b>“Which if a person does, he shall live by them”</b> (Leviticus 18:5). It <b>is not stated:</b> Which if <b>priests and Levites and Israelites</b> do, they shall live by them, <b>but rather: A person,</b> indicating that all people are included. <b>You have therefore learned that even a gentile who engages in Torah</b> study <b>is</b> considered <b>like a High Priest.</b>
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: Rav Yosef meant that <b>they do not receive the reward as</b> does <b>one who is commanded</b> to perform a mitzva <b>and performs</b> it, <b>but as</b> does <b>one who is not commanded</b> to perform a mitzva <b>and performs</b> it anyway. <b>As Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> One who is <b>commanded and performs</b> a mitzva <b>is greater than</b> one who <b>is not commanded and performs</b> it.
<b>The Sages taught</b> the following story in the context of the aforementioned <i>halakha</i>: <b>And the Roman kingdom once sent two military officials [<i>sardeyotot</i>] to the Sages of Israel,</b> and ordered them in the name of the king: <b>Teach us your Torah.</b> The officials <b>read</b> the Torah, <b>and repeated</b> it, <b>and</b> repeated it again, reading it for the <b>third</b> time. <b>At the time of their departure, they said to</b> the Sages: <b>We have examined your entire Torah and it is true, except for this</b> one <b>matter that you state,</b> i.e., that with regard to <b>an ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a gentile,</b> the owner is <b>exempt</b> from liability, whereas with regard to the ox <b>of a gentile that gored the ox of a Jew, whether</b> it was <b>innocuous or forewarned,</b> the owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
The officials’ reasoning was that this <i>halakha</i> is difficult <b>whichever way you</b> look at it. <b>If</b> the phrase <b>“of another”</b> is meant in <b>a precise</b> manner, that the owners of both oxen must both be Jewish, then <b>even when</b> the ox <b>of a gentile gores the ox of a Jew</b> the owner of the ox <b>should be exempt</b> from liability. <b>And if</b> the phrase <b>“of another”</b> is <b>not</b> meant in <b>a precise</b> manner, and the oxen of all are included, then <b>even when</b> the ox <b>of a Jew gores the ox of a gentile</b> the owner <b>should be liable.</b> They added: <b>But we will not inform this matter to the kingdom;</b> having acknowledged that the entire Torah is true, we will not reveal this ruling, as it will displease the kingdom.
§ Incidentally, it is related that <b>the daughter</b> of <b>Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda died. The Sages said to Ulla: Arise; let us go console him.</b> Ulla <b>said to them: What</b> business <b>do I have with the consolation of Babylonians, which is</b> actually <b>heresy? As, they say</b> while consoling mourners: <b>What can be done?</b> This seems to suggest that <b>if it were possible to do</b> something, acting against the Almighty’s decree, <b>they would do</b> so, which is tantamount to heresy. Therefore, Ulla declined to accompany the Babylonian Sages.
Ulla therefore <b>went to</b> console Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda <b>by himself,</b> and <b>said to him:</b> The verse states: <b>“And the Lord said to me, do not be at enmity with Moab, neither contend with them in battle”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:9). <b>What entered Moses’s mind,</b> that God had to warn him not to undertake a particular action? Did it enter his mind <b>to wage war</b> with the Moabites <b>without permission? Rather, Moses reasoned an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>by himself, saying: And if</b> with regard to <b>the Midianites, who came only to help the Moabites</b> harm the Jewish people (see Numbers, chapter 22), <b>the Torah said: “Harass the Midianites and smite them”</b> (Numbers 25:17),

Daf 38b

with regard to the <b>Moabites themselves,</b> is it <b>not</b> clear <b>all the more so</b> that they should be attacked?
To counter this, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: That which has entered your mind has not entered Mine,</b> because <b>I have two virtuous fledglings [<i>feridot</i>],</b> i.e., girls, <b>to extract from them: Ruth the Moabite,</b> who will be the foremother of the dynasty of David, <b>and Naamah the Ammonite,</b> Solomon’s wife, from whom the continuation of that dynasty will emerge. For the sake of these women, the Moabites and Ammonites must not be destroyed.
Ulla continued: <b>And are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>? If for the sake of two virtuous fledglings the Holy One, Blessed be He, had pity on two large nations and did not destroy them,</b> then <b>if the daughter of my teacher,</b> Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda, <b>was righteous, and she had</b> the <b>potential for something good to emerge from her,</b> it is <b>all the more so</b> clear <b>that she would have lived.</b>
§ Having mentioned the Moabites and Ammonites, the Gemara cites that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, does not deprive any creature of</b> its <b>reward.</b> He rewards every person for his good deeds, and provides <b>reward even for</b> using <b>pleasant speech</b> by using euphemisms.
<b>As</b> with regard to the descendants of the <b>elder</b> of the two daughters of Lot, <b>who said</b> that the name of her son, whom she conceived with her father, would be <b>Moab,</b> meaning: From father, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: “Do not be at enmity with Moab, neither contend with them in battle,”</b> indicating that <b>specifically</b> a full-fledged <b>battle was not</b> authorized <b>but</b> that the Jewish people could <b>impose forced labor [<i>angarya</i>] on them.</b>
By contrast, with regard to the descendants of the <b>younger</b> daughter, <b>who said</b> her son’s name would be <b>ben Ami,</b> meaning: Son of my nation, merely alluding to the fact she conceived him through an incestuous union, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He said to Moses: “And when you come near against the children of Ammon, do not harass them, nor contend with them”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:19). In other words, do not contend with them <b>at all; do not even impose forced labor on them.</b> This additional prohibition was a reward for her employing a euphemism when naming her son.
<b>And</b> with regard to the daughters of Lot, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: A person should always hasten to perform a mitzva, as due to</b> the <b>one night by which the elder</b> daughter of Lot <b>preceded the younger</b> daughter, with the intention of performing a mitzva by bringing children into the world, <b>she preceded her by four generations</b> in having her descendants enter <b>into the Jewish people.</b> They are: <b>Obed,</b> son of Ruth the Moabite, <b>Yishai, David, and Solomon. Whereas,</b> the descendants of <b>the younger</b> daughter did not join the Jewish people <b>until Rehoboam,</b> Solomon’s son, was born, <b>as it is written: “And his mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite”</b> (I Kings 14:31).
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>the ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a Samaritan,</b> the owner is <b>exempt</b> from liability. <b>But</b> with regard to the ox <b>of a Samaritan that gored the ox of a Jew,</b> if the Samaritan’s ox was <b>innocuous he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage, and</b> if it was <b>forewarned, he pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b> Accordingly, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to Samaritans is not identical to that of a gentile, who is liable to pay the full cost of the damage even for the act of an innocuous ox.
<b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> With regard to <b>the ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a Samaritan,</b> the owner of the ox is <b>exempt</b> from liability. <b>And</b> with regard to the ox <b>of a Samaritan that gored the ox of a Jew, whether</b> it was <b>innocuous or forewarned,</b> the owner <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage,</b> like a gentile.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>Samaritans are converts</b> who had converted due to fear <b>of lions,</b> i.e., the original conversion of the Samaritans was under duress and consequently meaningless, and therefore he assigns to them the same status as gentiles with regard to liability for damages?
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this suggestion from a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 56b): <b>All bloodstained</b> clothes, presumably from menstrual blood, <b>that come from</b> the city of <b>Rekem are ritually pure,</b> since most of the residents there are gentiles, and the bloodstains of gentile women are not ritually impure. Nevertheless, <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> them <b>impure because,</b> in his opinion, the inhabitants of Rekem <b>are converts who are mistaken,</b> i.e., they converted, and they do not observe the mitzvot because they have forgotten Judaism. He holds that since they are halakhically Jewish, their blood is ritually impure.
Bloodstained clothes that come <b>from among gentiles</b> are considered <b>pure.</b> With regard to bloodstained clothes that come <b>from among Jews or from among Samaritans, Rabbi Meir deems</b> them <b>impure,</b> as he suspects them of not taking care to keep impure clothes out of the public domain. <b>And the Rabbis deem</b> them <b>pure, as Jews</b> and Samaritans <b>are not suspected of</b> not being careful about <b>their bloodstains.</b>
<b>Apparently, Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>Samaritans are true converts;</b> otherwise the <i>halakha</i> concerning them would be the same as for gentiles, whose bloodstains are not impure at all. This being the case, why does Rabbi Meir regard them as gentiles with regard to liability to pay damages?
<b>Rabbi Abbahu says:</b> They are true converts, and are therefore considered Jews by Torah law inasmuch as in the event that a Jew’s ox causes damage to them, the owner of the ox is liable to pay damages, and if an innocuous ox belonging to them gores a Jew’s ox, the owner pays only half the cost of the damage. Nevertheless, <b>Rabbi Meir imposed a monetary fine on them,</b> giving them the status of gentiles, <b>so that</b> Jews <b>would not assimilate with them.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises an objection</b> to this answer from a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 29a): <b>And these</b> are the cases of <b>young women for whom there is a fine</b> paid to their fathers by one who rapes them. Not only is one who rapes a Jewish young woman of unflawed lineage liable to pay this fine, but so is <b>one who engages in intercourse with a <i>mamzeret</i>, or with a female Gibeonite, or with a female Samaritan.</b> Rabbi Zeira states his objection: <b>And if it enters your mind that Rabbi Meir imposed a monetary fine on them</b> to render them like gentiles, <b>so too, let us fine</b> a female Samaritan who is raped, by rendering her ineligible to receive the fine for rape, <b>so that</b> people will not consider them regular Jews and <b>will not assimilate with them.</b>
<b>Abaye said:</b> According to Rabbi Meir, the reason the Sages did not revoke this fine is <b>in order</b>

Daf 39a

<b>that</b> the <b>sinner,</b> i.e., the rapist, <b>should not be rewarded.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>But</b> if that is the reason, <b>let him give</b> the fine <b>to the poor</b> instead of to the Samaritan who he raped, to prevent assimilation. <b>Rav Mari said:</b> This is not done, <b>because it is money that has no claimants.</b> Since one would not be liable to give it to a specific poor person, the rapist could evade payment by responding to any claimant that he wants to give it to a different poor person. The Sages upheld the Torah law as it stands, and the fine is given to the Samaritan so that the sinner will not benefit.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>If an ox of</b> a halakhically <b>competent person gored an ox of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor,</b> all of whom are not considered halakhically competent, the owner is <b>liable</b> for damages. <b>But if</b> an ox <b>of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor gored an ox of</b> a halakhically <b>competent person,</b> the owner of the ox is <b>exempt</b> from liability.
<b>If an ox belonging to a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor gored</b> another ox and caused damage, <b>the court appoints a steward for them and warns them</b> with regard to the ox that gored <b>in the presence of the steward.</b> The ox is thereby rendered a forewarned ox, since the steward is considered its owner with regard to the requirement of the verse: “And warning has been given to its owner” (Exodus 21:29).
If, after the ox was rendered forewarned in this manner, <b>the deaf-mute regained his hearing, the imbecile became</b> halakhically <b>competent, or the minor reached</b> the age of <b>majority,</b> the ox has thereby <b>reverted to its</b> status of <b>innocuousness.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir,</b> who maintains that the ox had the status of a forewarned ox only while it was under the custody of the steward. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: It retains its</b> previous <b>status</b> of being forewarned.
If <b>a stadium [<i>ha’itztadin</i>] ox,</b> i.e., one that is trained to fight in a stadium, gores and kills a person, it <b>is not liable</b> to be put to <b>death, as it is stated:</b> “And <b>if an ox gores</b> a man or a woman” (Exodus 21:28). This is referring only to an ox that gores on its own initiative, <b>but not to</b> the case of an ox where others <b>induced it to gore.</b> Therefore, the owner of a stadium ox, which is trained to gore, is exempt from liability if it does.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: <b>This matter itself is difficult.</b> First the mishna <b>said: If</b> an ox <b>of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor gored an ox of</b> a halakhically <b>competent person,</b> the owner of the ox is <b>exempt</b> from liability. <b>Apparently,</b> the court <b>does not appoint a steward for</b> the owner of <b>an innocuous</b> ox <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>collecting</b> damages <b>from</b> the proceeds of the sale of <b>its body.</b> But <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>If an ox belonging to a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor gored</b> another ox and caused damage, <b>the court appoints a steward for them and warns them</b> with regard to the ox that gored <b>in the presence of the steward. Apparently,</b> the court <b>appoints a steward for</b> the owner of <b>an innocuous</b> ox <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>collecting</b> damages <b>from its body.</b>
<b>Rava said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the mishna <b>is teaching:</b> A steward is not appointed to enable collection of compensation from the bodies of innocuous oxen, <b>but if they have acquired the reputation of being habitually goring</b> oxen, as this was not an isolated incident, the court <b>appoints a steward</b> for the owners, <b>and warns them in the presence of the steward, and</b> thereby <b>renders</b> the oxen <b>forewarned.</b> This is so <b>that when</b> one of the oxen <b>gores again,</b> the owner will be liable <b>to pay</b> compensation <b>from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, and not only from the proceeds of the sale of the goring ox.
The Gemara asks: <b>From whose superior-quality</b> property is compensation collected for damage caused by a forewarned ox belonging to minor orphans? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From the superior-quality</b> property <b>of the orphans. Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: From the superior-quality</b> property <b>of the steward.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this? But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav Asi says:</b> The court <b>does not attend to the property of orphans</b> to have them pay a debt <b>unless interest is eroding</b> their estate. In other words, in a case where the orphans’ father borrowed money from a gentile with interest, the court ensures that the debt is paid from the orphans’ property, since if they wait to pay the debt, it will grow dramatically. Apparently, in other cases the court does not collect from their property.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The court collects from them <b>either to</b> pay a debt recorded in <b>a document that has</b> the payment of <b>interest</b> stipulated in it, in order to ensure that the interest does not diminish the value their estate, <b>or for</b> the payment of <b>a woman’s marriage contract, due to</b> their interest in not paying for her <b>sustenance.</b> A widow can claim her marriage contract from her deceased husband’s property, and as long as she does not receive it, her husband’s heirs are responsible for providing her sustenance. In a case where the heirs are minor orphans, the court collects payment of the marriage contract from the orphans’ property, so that they will not have to pay for her sustenance in the interim. Evidently, Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that with the exception of these two cases, the court does not collect debts from the property of orphans.
The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the opinions. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is the one who <b>says</b> that payment for damage caused by forewarned oxen is collected <b>from the superior-quality</b> property <b>of the steward,</b> and <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina</b> is the one who <b>says</b> that it is collected <b>from the superior-quality</b> property <b>of the orphans.</b>
<b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>Due to the difficulty</b> created by the contradiction between the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> here <b>and</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> there, <b>you render Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina mistaken,</b> by attributing an opinion to him that is not the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Wasn’t Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina a judge who delved into the complexities of the <i>halakha</i>?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> one can resolve the contradiction in another manner: <b>Actually, do not reverse</b> the opinions. <b>And</b> the resolution to the contradiction is that although Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that debts are not collected from the property of minor orphans, the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>one who causes damage</b> to another by not safeguarding his animal <b>is different. Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that compensation is collected <b>from the superior-quality</b> property <b>of the orphans, because if you say</b> that it should be collected <b>from the superior-quality</b> property <b>of the steward,</b>

Daf 39b

people <b>will refrain from becoming</b> stewards, fearing that they would incur a financial loss by having to pay for damage caused by the orphans’ animals. By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says</b> that it is collected <b>from the superior-quality</b> property <b>of the steward, and</b> there is no concern that people will refrain from becoming stewards, because if they pay for the orphans <b>they are subsequently repaid by the orphans when they grow up.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> the matter of whether or not the court <b>appoints stewards for</b> the halakhically incompetent owners <b>of an innocuous</b> ox <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>collecting</b> damages <b>from</b> the sale of <b>its body</b> if it gores <b>is</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an ox whose owner became a deaf-mute, or whose owner became an imbecile, or whose owner went overseas,</b> if the ox gores, <b>Yehuda ben Nakosa</b> said that <b>Sumakhos said: It retains its</b> status of <b>innocuousness until</b> the court <b>renders it forewarned in the presence of the owner. And the Rabbis say:</b> The court <b>appoints stewards for them, and</b> the ox <b>is rendered forewarned in the presence of the stewards.</b>
If <b>the deaf-mute regained his hearing,</b> or <b>the imbecile became</b> halakhically <b>competent, or the minor reached majority, or its owner came</b> back <b>from overseas, Yehuda ben Nakosa</b> said that <b>Sumakhos said:</b> The ox <b>has reverted to its</b> previous status of <b>innocuousness, until it is rendered forewarned in the presence of the owner. Rabbi Yosei said:</b> The ox <b>retains its status</b> of being forewarned.
The Sages <b>said: What did Sumakhos</b> mean <b>by saying</b> that <b>it retains its</b> status of <b>innocuousness? If we say that</b> he meant that <b>it is not rendered forewarned at all,</b> and is still considered innocuous, <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> Sumakhos himself <b>teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> that the ox <b>has reverted to its</b> previous status of <b>innocuousness,</b> it is clear <b>by inference that</b> previously <b>it was rendered forewarned.</b>
<b>Rather, what</b> did Sumakhos mean by saying that <b>it retains its</b> status of <b>innocuousness [<i>betammuto</i>]?</b> He meant that <b>it retains its completeness [<i>bitmimuto</i>], as we do not reduce its</b> owner’s share of it by collecting compensation from the sale of its body. Rather, the injured party must wait until the owner becomes competent or returns. <b>Apparently,</b> the court <b>does not appoint a steward for</b> the owner <b>of an innocuous</b> ox to enable the injured party <b>to collect</b> damages <b>from its body. And the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Sumakhos, <b>say</b> that the court <b>appoints a steward for</b> the owner <b>and renders</b> the ox <b>forewarned in the presence of the steward. Apparently,</b> they hold that the court <b>does appoint a steward for</b> the owner <b>of an innocuous</b> ox to enable the injured party <b>to collect</b> damages <b>from its body.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>with regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to whether a change of <b>custody changes</b> the status of the ox. <b>Sumakhos holds</b> that a change of <b>custody changes</b> the status of the ox, <b>whereas Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that a change of <b>custody does not change</b> it; rather, it is determined by the actions of the ox itself, regardless of its custody.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an ox that gored</b> that belonged to <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, Rabbi Ya’akov pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What did Rabbi Ya’akov do</b> that he should pay for the damage? <b>Rather,</b> emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>say: Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that <b>he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>With what are we dealing? If</b> it is <b>with regard to an innocuous</b> ox, <b>isn’t</b> this <b>obvious? Everyone</b> else <b>also</b> holds that one <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> caused by their ox that gored, so what is the novel element of Rabbi Ya’akov’s statement? <b>And if</b> it is <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox it is unclear why the owner pays half the cost of the damage, as <b>if</b> it is a case <b>where he provided</b> adequate <b>safeguarding for it he is not required to pay at all, and if</b> it is a case <b>where he did not provide</b> adequate <b>safeguarding for it he is required to pay the entire</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
<b>Rava said: Actually,</b> Rabbi Ya’akov stated his ruling <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox, <b>and here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where he provided reduced safeguarding and did not provide superior safeguarding for it.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Ya’akov holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that when an ox is rendered forewarned the liability for <b>its element of innocuousness remains in place.</b> In other words, with regard to half of the damages, it is treated like an innocuous ox, and it is treated as a forewarned ox only with regard to the other half of the damages. Therefore, half the cost of the damage is still collected from the proceeds of the sale of its body. <b>And</b> furthermore, with regard to another issue Rabbi Ya’akov <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that although superior safeguarding is necessary for an innocuous ox, <b>reduced safeguarding is sufficient for a forewarned</b> ox. Consequently, one who safeguards his forewarned ox in this manner is exempt from paying the additional half that he would be liable to pay due to the ox’s forewarned status. He is liable with respect to the half that he pays due to its remaining element of innocuousness.
<b>And</b> Rabbi Ya’akov also <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that the court <b>appoints a steward for</b> the owner <b>of an innocuous</b> ox to enable the injured party <b>to collect</b> damages <b>from its body.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Ya’akov rules that in the case in the <i>baraita</i>, where a forewarned ox owned by a halakhically incompetent person is safeguarded in a reduced fashion, half the cost of the damage must be paid from the proceeds of the sale of its body.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>But do</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Ya’akov <b>not disagree</b> with regard to this matter? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that with regard to <b>an ox of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, that gored, Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the owner <b>liable, and Rabbi Ya’akov says that he pays</b> only <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage? Rabba bar Ulla says:</b> There is no disagreement here; <b>Rabbi Ya’akov</b> merely <b>explained what Rabbi Yehuda deems him liable</b> to pay.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Abaye, who says</b> that Rabbi Ya’akov and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree, with regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b>
The Gemara answers: Abaye could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>here we are dealing with a forewarned</b> ox whose owner <b>did not safeguard it at all</b> and that is consequently liable for the full cost of the damage.
And <b>Rabbi Ya’akov holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to one</b> issue <b>and disagrees with him with regard to one</b> issue. <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to one</b> issue, <b>as Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that when an ox is rendered forewarned <b>its element of innocuousness remains in its place,</b> and Rabbi Ya’akov agrees. <b>And he disagrees with him with regard to one</b> issue, <b>as Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the court <b>appoints a steward for</b> the owner <b>of an innocuous</b> ox to enable the injured party <b>to collect</b> damages <b>from its body, whereas Rabbi Ya’akov holds</b> that the court <b>does not appoint</b> a steward. Therefore, the owner is exempt from paying the half for which he would be liable due to the ox’s element of innocuousness, <b>and pays only the half</b> damages he is liable to pay <b>due to</b> its <b>forewarned</b> status.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Abaye said to Ravina: Granted, according to Abaye, who says</b> that <b>they disagree,</b> the explanation <b>works out well. But according to Rava, who says</b> that <b>they do not disagree, instead of interpreting</b> the <i>baraita</i> as referring <b>to a forewarned</b> ox, <b>he should have interpreted it</b> as referring <b>to an innocuous</b> ox.

Daf 40a

There are two scenarios in which the <i>baraita</i> could be interpreted as referring to an innocuous ox. <b>If</b> one wants to interpret it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> it can be discussing a case <b>where he provided reduced safeguarding for it and did not provide superior safeguarding for it. If</b> one wants to interpret it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov,</b> it can be discussing a case <b>where he did not provide safeguarding for it at all.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> With regard to <b>both an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox <b>whose</b> owner <b>provided reduced safeguarding for them, he is exempt.</b> The owner is liable only if he did not safeguard them at all. <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>Rabbi Ya’akov teaches us this, that</b> the court <b>appoints stewards for</b> the owners <b>of an innocuous</b> ox to enable the injured party <b>to collect</b> damages <b>from</b> the proceeds of the sale of <b>its body.</b>
Ravina <b>said to him</b> that <b>this is what</b> Rava <b>was saying</b> by interpreting Rabbi Ya’akov’s statement with regard to a forewarned ox: Rabbi Ya’akov stated <b>one</b> matter <b>containing two</b> elements of <b>reasoning [<i>ta’ama</i>]</b> in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion, namely, that a forewarned ox retains its element of innocuousness, and that reduced safeguarding is sufficient for a forewarned ox.
<b>Ravina</b> himself <b>said</b> a different explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: The practical difference <b>between</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Ya’akov <b>is</b> with regard to whether a change of <b>custody changes</b> the status of the ox. <b>For example,</b> in a case where the ox <b>was forewarned</b> while in the custody of the steward <b>and</b> subsequently <b>the deaf-mute regained his hearing, or the imbecile became</b> halakhically <b>competent, or the minor reached majority,</b> and the ox returned to its owner’s custody. <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>it is</b> still <b>in its</b> previous <b>status,</b> the change of custody notwithstanding, and that therefore the owner is liable for the full cost of the damage. By contrast, <b>Rabbi Ya’akov holds</b> that the change of <b>custody changes</b> the status of the ox, which reverts to innocuousness, and so the owner pays only half the cost of the damage.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Stewards</b> are liable to <b>pay from</b> their <b>superior-quality</b> property for damage caused by forewarned oxen under their custody, <b>but they do not pay a ransom</b> if the oxen killed a person.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that the purpose of <b>ransom</b> is <b>atonement</b> for the owner of the ox, <b>and</b> that therefore a minor orphan’s steward is exempt from liability to pay it, as <b>orphans are not subject to</b> the obligation of <b>atonement</b> since they are not morally responsible?
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: It is Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: “If a ransom is imposed upon him, <b>then he shall give for the redemption of his life”</b> (Exodus 21:30), is referring to the monetary <b>value of the injured</b> party. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says:</b> The ransom corresponds to the monetary <b>value of the one liable for the damage.</b>
<b>What, do they not disagree with regard to this</b> very issue? In other words, <b>the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>ransom is monetary restitution</b> for the damage caused, and therefore the heirs of the victim must be paid the monetary value of the victim. <b>And Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, holds</b> that <b>ransom</b> is <b>atonement</b> for causing the death of a person. Accordingly, the amount of the ransom is the monetary value of the one liable, since, from the perspective of his moral responsibility for the incident, he deserves to pay with his life. Although the court does not impose capital punishment, his atonement is through payment of his own value.
<b>Rav Pappa said: No,</b> it is possible <b>that</b> according to <b>everyone ransom is atonement, and here they disagree with regard to this</b> issue: <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that <b>we evaluate</b> the amount that is appropriate for atonement <b>according to</b> the monetary value <b>of the injured</b> party, <b>and Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, holds</b> that <b>we evaluate</b> it <b>according to</b> the value <b>of the one liable for the damage.</b> All agree that the purpose of the ransom is atonement.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis? Imposing is stated</b> in the <b>later</b> verse: “If ransom is imposed upon him” (Exodus 21:30), <b>and imposing is stated</b> in the <b>earlier</b> verse, concerning a person who injures a pregnant woman, causing her to miscarry: “He shall be punished as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him” (Exodus 21:22). This verbal analogy indicates comparison of the two <i>halakhot</i>: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to compensation for causing miscarriage, the evaluation is <b>according to</b> the monetary value <b>of the injured</b> party<b>,</b> i.e., the fetus, <b>so too here,</b> the ransom is <b>according to</b> the value <b>of the injured</b> party.
<b>And Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, holds</b> that the fact that <b>it is written: “And he shall give for the redemption of his life,”</b> indicates that the ransom is redemption of the life of the ox’s owner, and its amount should accordingly be the owner’s monetary value.
<b>And the Rabbis</b> would respond to this reasoning that <b>indeed,</b> the phrase: <b>“For the redemption of his life,” is written,</b> indicating that the purpose of the ransom is redemption of his life. <b>Nevertheless, when we evaluate</b> the amount he is liable to pay, <b>we evaluate</b> it <b>according to</b> the value <b>of the injured</b> party.
§ <b>Rava was praising Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov before Rav Naḥman,</b> saying <b>that he is a great man.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: When he</b> happens to <b>come to you, bring him to</b> visit <b>me.</b>
<b>When</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov eventually <b>came to him,</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Ask me something.</b> Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov <b>asked him:</b> If <b>an ox belonging to two partners</b> kills a person, <b>how do they pay</b> the <b>ransom?</b>
If <b>this</b> partner <b>pays</b> the <b>ransom</b> in full <b>and that</b> partner also pays the <b>ransom</b> in full, it would seem incorrect, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> that <b>one ransom</b> shall be paid, <b>but not two ransoms.</b> If <b>this</b> partner pays <b>half</b> the <b>ransom and that</b> partner pays <b>half</b> the <b>ransom,</b> it would also seem incorrect, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> that <b>a full ransom</b> shall be paid, <b>but not half a ransom.</b>
<b>While</b> Rav Naḥman <b>was sitting and pondering this</b> question, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov asked him another question. <b>He said to him: We learned</b> in a mishna: The court <b>repossesses</b> property <b>from those liable</b> to pay their <b>valuations</b> who are delaying their payments. But the court <b>does not repossess</b> property <b>from those liable</b> to bring <b>sin-offerings and guilt-offerings;</b> they are relied upon to bring their offerings of their own initiative, as it is assumed they want to atone for their transgressions (<i>Arakhin</i> 21a). In light of this mishna, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>those liable</b> to pay <b>ransom?</b>
Should it be reasoned that <b>since it is atonement, it is similar to</b> the cases of <b>a sin-offering and a guilt-offering,</b> which a person <b>treats seriously,</b> as it is in his interest to achieve atonement, <b>and</b> therefore the court <b>does not need to repossess</b> property <b>from him? Or perhaps</b> it should be reasoned that <b>since he is required to give</b> the ransom <b>to another</b> person, he considers <b>it a financial</b> liability <b>and</b> does <b>not</b> consider <b>it</b> an obligation <b>toward the Most High, and</b> consequently he <b>does not treat it seriously</b> enough; <b>and</b> therefore the court <b>needs to repossess</b> property <b>from him,</b> as he might not pay it.
<b>Alternatively,</b> it could be reasoned that <b>since he</b> himself <b>did not sin but</b> rather <b>it is his property,</b> i.e., his ox, <b>that caused the damage, he does not treat the matter seriously</b> enough, <b>and</b> therefore the court <b>needs to repossess</b> property <b>from him</b> to ensure payment.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Leave me alone. I am</b> still <b>stuck on the first</b> question and have no solution, so you must not raise further difficult questions.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> Even though one who borrows an ox from another is generally responsible for damage that it causes, <b>if he borrowed it on the presumption</b> that it was <b>innocuous</b> and it gored and caused damage, <b>and it was</b> then <b>found</b> to be <b>forewarned, the owner pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage and the borrower pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
If the ox <b>was rendered forewarned in the house of the borrower,</b> i.e., it gored three times while in his possession, and he was warned in court, <b>and he</b> then <b>returned it to the owner</b> and it subsequently gored, <b>the owner pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> as with regard to him it is still considered innocuous, having become forewarned while not in his custody, <b>and the borrower is exempt from</b> paying <b>any</b> compensation, since the ox is no longer in his custody.
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>borrowed</b> the ox <b>on the presumption</b> that it was <b>innocuous and it was found</b> to be <b>forewarned, the owner pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage and the borrower pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> should the borrower pay at all? <b>Let him say to</b> the owner: <b>I borrowed an ox; I did not borrow a lion.</b> I did not accept responsibility for safeguarding a forewarned ox, which behaves violently like a lion.
<b>Rav said: Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the borrower <b>was aware</b> at the time he borrowed it <b>that it was a goring</b> ox and liable to cause damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is the case, <b>let him say to</b> the owner: Even though I knew that it was a goring ox, nevertheless, <b>I borrowed an innocuous</b> ox. <b>I did not</b> intend to <b>borrow a forewarned</b> ox and thereby accept responsibility for safeguarding an ox for which one must pay the full cost of its damage.
The Gemara answers that the borrower is liable <b>because</b> the owner <b>can say to him: Ultimately,</b> even <b>if it was innocuous, you would be required to pay half the damages.</b> Therefore, <b>now too, go pay half the damages.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is the case, <b>let</b> the borrower <b>say to</b> the owner: <b>If it was innocuous,</b> the damages <b>would be paid from</b> the proceeds of the sale of <b>the body of</b> the ox, not from my property.
The Gemara answers: The borrower cannot say this, <b>because</b> the owner <b>can say to him: Ultimately, would you not have been required to pay me</b> back the full value of my <b>ox?</b> As a borrower you are obligated to return the ox to me in the same condition that you borrowed it. Even if compensation was collected from the proceeds of its sale you would still have been required to return its full value to me. Therefore, in any event you would effectively be paying for the damage, so you are not losing anything from the fact that the ox is forewarned.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is the case, <b>let</b> the borrower <b>say to him:</b>

Daf 40b

<b>If</b> the ox <b>was innocuous, I would have admitted</b> my liability <b>and would</b> thereby <b>have been exempt.</b> A fine is imposed only as result of the testimony of two witnesses; if the offender admits his liability, no fine is imposed. Therefore, since the liability to pay half the cost of the damage for the act of an innocuous ox is a fine, the borrower could have rendered himself exempt from liability through admission.
<b>And even according to the one who says</b> that payment of <b>half the damage is</b> considered <b>monetary restitution,</b> not a fine, and therefore his admission would not have rendered himself exempt from liability, <b>let</b> the borrower <b>say to him: If</b> the ox <b>was innocuous, I would have smuggled it out to the marsh [<i>agma</i>]</b> so that the injured party would not find it in my possession. He would then be unable to collect damages from me, since he can collect payment only from the proceeds of the sale of the ox. By contrast, compensation for damage caused by a forewarned ox can be collected from all of the owner’s property, and the borrower had no way of render-ing himself exempt from liability. Therefore, it is unclear why the borrower is liable to pay half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where the court seized</b> the ox <b>first,</b> before the borrower had the chance to admit his liability or to smuggle the ox to the marsh. Therefore, the borrower cannot claim that he would have been able to render himself exempt from liability.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why does the owner pay half</b> the cost of <b>the damage? Let him say to</b> the borrower: <b>You let my ox be seized by</b> the court, <b>with whom I cannot engage in litigation</b> in an attempt to reach a compromise; the court collects full payment, and you are responsible for this situation. Therefore, you should pay the entire amount. The Gemara answers that the owner is liable to pay <b>because</b> the borrower <b>can say to him: If I would have returned it to you, would</b> the court <b>not have taken it from you?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is the case, <b>let</b> the owner <b>say to him</b> in response: <b>If you would have returned it to me I would have smuggled it to the marsh,</b> and the court would not have been able to seize it. The Gemara answers: The owner cannot say this, <b>because</b> the borrower <b>can say to him: Ultimately, would</b> the injured party <b>not</b> then <b>have received payment from</b> your <b>superior-quality</b> property, as is the <i>halakha</i> in the case of a forewarned ox, where the compensation paid is not only from the proceeds of the sale of the belligerent ox?
The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> explanation <b>works out well</b> in a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>has</b> other <b>property</b> from which compensation can be collected, besides the ox. But <b>where he does not have</b> other <b>property, what is there to say?</b> In that case, the borrower has in fact caused him loss.
The Gemara answers: The reason the borrower is exempt is <b>because</b> he <b>can say to</b> the owner: <b>Just as I am indebted to you,</b> to return your ox to you, <b>so too, I am indebted to that</b> injured party to whom you owe compensation. This is <b>due to</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Natan.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where</b> is it derived that if one <b>is owed one hundred dinars by another, and the other</b> person, i.e., the debtor, is owed one hundred dinars <b>by another</b> person, the court <b>appropriates</b> payment <b>from that</b> latter debtor <b>and gives</b> the money directly <b>to this</b> first creditor, without going through the middleman, who is both the first debtor and the second creditor? <b>The verse states,</b> with regard to returning stolen property: <b>“And he gives it to the one with regard to whom he is guilty”</b> (Numbers 5:7), indicating that there is a situation where the liable party pays a third party to whom his creditor owes money in turn.
It is stated at the end of the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier (40a): If the ox <b>was rendered forewarned in the house of the borrower, and</b> the borrower then <b>returned it to the owner</b> and it subsequently gored, <b>the owner pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage and the borrower is exempt from</b> paying <b>any</b> compensation.
The Gemara asks: <b>The last clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i> indicates that a change of <b>custody changes</b> the status of the ox; if it was rendered forewarned while in the borrower’s possession and was then returned to its owner, the owner pays only half the cost of the damage for any subsequent damage it might cause, as it is no longer considered forewarned. By contrast, <b>the first clause</b> of the same <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that the ox retains its status as forewarned even after being borrowed, indicates that a change of <b>custody does not change</b> the status of the ox.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This <i>baraita</i> is <b>disjointed [<i>tavra</i>].</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>who taught this</b> clause <b>did not teach that</b> clause.
<b>Rabba said: From</b> the fact that <b>the first clause</b> follows the opinion that a change of <b>custody does not change</b> the status of the ox, it is inferred that <b>the last clause also</b> follows the opinion that a change of <b>custody does not change</b> its status. <b>And this is the reason</b> that in <b>the last clause</b> the ox reverts to its status of innocuousness: It is <b>because</b> the owner <b>can say to</b> the borrower: <b>It is not in your power to render my ox forewarned,</b> as I did not give it to you with that intention and it was your negligence that caused the change in its status. Therefore, the owner is not liable to pay additional compensation that results from the status the ox acquired under the custody of the borrower.
<b>Rav Pappa said: From</b> the fact that <b>the last clause</b> follows the opinion that a change of <b>custody changes</b> the status of the ox, it is inferred that <b>the first clause also</b> follows the opinion that a change of <b>custody changes</b> its status. <b>And this is the reason</b> that in <b>the first clause</b> the ox is considered forewarned even when in the custody of the borrower: It is <b>because wherever it goes, the name of its owner is upon it.</b> Since it was rendered forewarned under its owner’s custody, with whom it remains identified, it is not considered to have undergone a change of custody.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>a stadium ox is not liable</b> to be put to <b>death,</b> since it was trained to gore. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If an ox kills a person it may not be brought as an offering, even if it is not put to death. If a stadium ox kills a person, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> sacrificing it on <b>the altar?</b>
<b>Rav says</b> that it is <b>fit</b> to be brought as an offering, <b>and Shmuel says</b> that it is <b>disqualified. Rav says</b> that the ox is <b>fit</b> because it acted <b>due to circumstances beyond its control,</b> as goring is what it was trained to do; <b>and Shmuel says</b> that it is <b>disqualified as,</b> in any event, <b>a transgression was committed through it.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that interprets the verse: “You shall bring your offering from the cattle, even from the herd or from the flock” (Leviticus 1:2). The phrase <b>“from the cattle”</b> is mentioned <b>to exclude</b> an animal that <b>engaged in bestiality and</b> an animal that <b>was the object of bestiality</b> from eligibility to be brought as an offering. The phrase <b>“from the herd”</b> is mentioned <b>to exclude</b> an animal that had been <b>worshipped</b> as a god. <b>“From the flock”</b> is mentioned <b>to exclude</b> an animal that had been <b>set aside</b> for idol worship. The additional conjunction “or,” in the phrase <b>“or from the flock”</b> is mentioned <b>to exclude</b> an animal that <b>gores</b> a person, killing him.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon said: If it is stated</b> that an animal that <b>engaged in bestiality</b> is disqualified from being brought as an offering, <b>why is it stated</b> that an animal that <b>gores</b> is disqualified? <b>And if it is stated</b> that an animal that <b>gores</b> is disqualified, <b>why is it stated</b> that an animal that <b>engaged in bestiality</b> is disqualified?
He explains: It is <b>because there is</b> a stringency <b>pertaining to</b> an animal that <b>engaged in bestiality that does not pertain to</b> one that <b>gores, and,</b> conversely, <b>there is</b> a stringency <b>pertaining to</b> an animal that <b>gores that does not pertain to</b> an animal that <b>engaged in bestiality.</b>
He clarifies: With regard to an animal that <b>engaged in bestiality,</b> the Torah <b>renders</b> a case where <b>it</b> is a victim of <b>circumstances beyond its control like</b> a case where it acted <b>willfully,</b> as it is disqualified in either case. By contrast, with regard to an animal that <b>gores,</b> the Torah <b>does not render</b> a case where <b>it</b> is a victim of <b>circumstances beyond its control like</b> a case where it acted <b>willfully.</b> Conversely, with regard to an animal that <b>gores,</b> its owner <b>pays</b> the <b>ransom;</b> whereas the owner of an animal that <b>engaged in bestiality does not pay a ransom. Therefore,</b> the Torah <b>had to state</b> that an animal that <b>engaged in bestiality</b> is disqualified <b>and had to state</b> that an animal that <b>gores</b> is disqualified.
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that with regard to an animal that <b>engaged in bestiality,</b> the Torah <b>renders</b> a case where <b>it</b> is a victim of <b>circumstances beyond its control like</b> a case where it acted <b>willfully.</b> By contrast, with regard to an animal that <b>gores,</b> the Torah <b>does not render</b> a case where <b>it</b> is a victim of <b>circumstances beyond its control like</b> a case where it acted <b>willfully. With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this stated? Is it <b>not with regard to</b> the animal’s eligibility to be brought as <b>an offering?</b> Accordingly, a stadium ox, which is considered a victim of circumstances beyond its control, is fit to be brought as an offering, contrary to Shmuel’s opinion.
The Gemara answers: <b>No, it is with regard to</b> the animal being put to <b>death,</b> i.e., the ox is not killed if it is a victim of circumstances beyond its control.
<b>So too, it is reasonable, as if you say</b> that the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>with regard to</b> the animal’s eligibility to be brought as <b>an offering,</b> how can the <i>baraita</i> state the following: By contrast, with regard to an animal that <b>gores,</b> the Torah <b>does not render</b> a case where <b>it</b> is a victim of <b>circumstances beyond its control like</b> a case where it acted <b>willfully. Neither</b> are <b>circumstances beyond its control written</b> in that context, <b>nor is its willingness written;</b> the issue is not mentioned in the Torah at all. <b>Rather,</b> is the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> stated <b>with regard to</b> the animal being put to <b>death,</b> where this distinction is indicated in the Torah? The mishna interprets the phrase: “And if an ox gores” (Exodus 21:28), as indicating that the ox is not put to death in a case where it is induced to gore; therefore, this distinction is mentioned in the Torah with regard to the animal being put to death. Accordingly, the <i>baraita</i> does not address the topic of dispute between Rav and Shmuel.
§ <b>The Master said</b> in the same <i>baraita</i>: With regard to an animal that <b>gores,</b> its owner <b>pays the ransom,</b> whereas the owner of an animal that <b>engaged in bestiality does not pay a ransom. What are the circumstances</b> under which the owner of an animal that engaged in bestiality is not liable to pay the ransom? <b>If we say that it</b> is when the animal <b>engaged in bestiality with</b> a woman <b>and killed her</b> in the process, <b>what</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> whether <b>it killed her with its horn,</b> and <b>what</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> whether <b>it killed her through bestiality?</b>
<b>And rather,</b> if the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>engaged in bestiality with her but did not kill her,</b> in that case, <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that he does not pay a ransom is</b> simply <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>it did not kill her,</b> so paying ransom is irrelevant; it is not a feature associated with the <i>halakhot</i> of an animal that engaged in bestiality.
<b>Abaye said: Actually,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>engaged in bestiality with her but did not kill her,</b> and it is still noteworthy that its owner is not liable to pay ransom, <b>as</b> the woman <b>was brought to court, and they executed her</b> for her transgression. <b>Lest you say</b>

Daf 41a

that the ox should be considered <b>like one that killed her,</b> as it was the reason for her execution, and therefore its owner should be liable to pay a ransom, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.
<b>Rava said: Actually,</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>engaged in bestiality with her and killed her</b> in the process. <b>And as for the difficulty you</b> pose: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> whether <b>it killed her with</b> its <b>horns,</b> and <b>what</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> whether <b>it killed her through bestiality,</b> the answer is that in that case of an animal killing with its <b>horn, its intention is to cause injury,</b> whereas in <b>this</b> case of killing through bestiality <b>its intention is to</b> achieve <b>its own pleasure.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> other case <b>would</b> Abaye and Rava <b>disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> a case where an ox <b>trampled a child with its foot,</b> killing it, <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party. <b>According to Abaye,</b> the owner <b>pays</b> the <b>ransom,</b> as he holds that ransom is paid even if the animal’s objective was not to cause injury or death. <b>According to Rava, he does not pay</b> the <b>ransom.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav: A stadium ox</b> that killed a person <b>is not liable</b> to be put to <b>death and</b> is <b>fit to</b> be sacrificed as an offering on <b>the altar, because it is as though it was compelled</b> to behave in this manner.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an ox that gored a person and</b> the person <b>died,</b> if the ox was <b>forewarned</b> its owner <b>pays ransom, but</b> if it was <b>innocuous he is exempt from</b> paying <b>the ransom. And</b> both <b>this</b> forewarned ox <b>and that</b> innocuous ox <b>are liable</b> to be put to <b>death</b> for killing a person. <b>And the same</b> <i>halakha</i> applies <b>in</b> a case where the animal killed <b>a boy and the same</b> applies <b>in</b> a case where it killed <b>a girl.</b> If the ox <b>gored</b> and killed a Canaanite <b>slave or</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant,</b> its owner <b>gives</b> the victim’s master <b>thirty <i>sela</i>, whether he was</b> a slave <b>worth one hundred <i>maneh</i>,</b> i.e., one hundred silver dinars, <b>or worth only one dinar.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>But since we kill</b> the ox for killing a person <b>when it is</b> still considered <b>innocuous, how can you find</b> a case of <b>a forewarned</b> ox killing a person?
<b>Rabba said: Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where in three</b> instances of attacking <b>people,</b> the court <b>assessed</b> that had the people not escaped, the ox would certainly have killed them. Therefore, despite the fact that the ox did not kill anyone, it now has the status of a forewarned ox.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> Such <b>an assessment is not</b> worth <b>anything.</b> Since the ox did not actually kill them, it is not rendered forewarned even if it intended to kill. <b>Rather, here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where it endangered</b> the lives of <b>three people</b> by goring them, and they all died only after the third goring. Therefore, the ox had not been put to death.
<b>Rav Zevid said:</b> The mishna is discussing a case <b>where it killed three animals,</b> which is sufficient to render the ox forewarned but for which it is not put to death.
The Gemara asks: <b>But is</b> an animal that is <b>forewarned with regard to animals</b> considered <b>forewarned with regard to people</b> as well? Certainly it is not. <b>Rather, Rav Shimi said:</b> The mishna is discussing a case <b>where it killed three gentiles,</b> for which the animal is not put to death.
The Gemara asks: <b>But is</b> an animal that is <b>forewarned with regard to gentiles</b> considered <b>forewarned with regard to Jews</b> as well? <b>Rather, Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said:</b> The mishna is discussing a case <b>where it killed three people who had wounds that would have caused them to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>].</b> Since they were on the verge of dying anyway, the ox is not put to death for killing them. Nevertheless, it is rendered forewarned with regard to its future goring and killing of people.
The Gemara asks: <b>But is</b> an animal that is <b>forewarned with regard to a <i>tereifa</i></b> considered <b>forewarned with regard to an intact</b> person, i.e., one who is not a <i>tereifa</i>? <b>Rather, Rav Pappa said:</b> The mishna is discussing a case <b>where it killed</b> a person <b>and fled to the marsh,</b> then <b>killed</b> again <b>and fled to the marsh,</b> and then killed again and fled to the marsh, so the court was not able kill it before it had killed three times, rendering it forewarned.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said:</b> The mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the witnesses <b>who had rendered</b> the witnesses who testified to the three incidents of goring as <b>conspiring witnesses,</b> result-ing in the animal not being put to death, <b>were</b> themselves subsequently <b>proven</b> to be <b>conspiring witnesses</b> by other witnesses. Consequently, the testimonies of the witnesses who testified about the incidents of goring were reinstated, rendering the ox forewarned.
The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> explanation <b>works out well if</b> it is assumed that the purpose of testifying to the ox’s goring is because <b>we wish to establish the ox as forewarned;</b> once the testimony concerning the incidents of goring is reinstated, it is established that the ox gored three times. <b>But if we wish to warn the man</b> who owns the ox by testifying that the animal gored, <b>he could say to</b> the judge, after it is established that his ox was forewarned: <b>I did not know</b> that my ox was forewarned, since the witnesses had previously been rendered conspiring witnesses. The Gemara answers: This is a case <b>where</b> the witnesses <b>say: Each time his ox killed</b> a person <b>he was standing by it,</b> so that he cannot claim ignorance.
<b>Ravina said:</b> The mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the witnesses <b>recognized the owner of the ox but did not recognize the ox</b> itself. Therefore, with regard to the first incidents of goring, they testified that it was his ox that gored, but they did not testify with regard to the ox itself. That is why the ox was not put to death. Only afterward did they realize that this was the ox that had gored three times previously.
The Gemara asks: If so, why is the ox rendered forewarned? <b>What could</b> the owner <b>have done</b> to prevent it from goring again, as he did not know which of his oxen had gored? The Gemara answers that it is rendered forewarned <b>because</b> the court effectively <b>said to him: You have</b> a habitually <b>goring ox in your herd,</b> so <b>you must safeguard your entire herd.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> both <b>this</b> forewarned ox <b>and that</b> innocuous ox <b>are liable</b> to be put to <b>death. The Sages taught:</b> We learn <b>by inference from</b> that <b>which is stated</b> with regard to an ox that killed a person: “And if an ox gores a man or a woman, that they die, <b>the ox shall be stoned,</b> and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be clear” (Exodus 21:28). <b>Don’t I know</b> from this verse <b>that</b> the stoning makes it an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass, and it is prohibited to eat</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass? What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “Its flesh shall not be eaten”? The verse is telling you that</b> even <b>if one slaughtered</b> the ox <b>after its verdict had been reached</b> but before it was stoned, it is still <b>prohibited to eat</b> it.
<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one is prohibited <b>to eat</b> it; <b>from where</b> is it derived that one is prohibited <b>from</b> deriving <b>benefit</b> from the ox as well? <b>The verse states: “But the owner of the ox shall be clear.”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the inference?</b> How is this <i>halakha</i> derived from the statement that the owner shall be clear? <b>Shimon ben Zoma says:</b> This is <b>like a person who says to his friend: So-and-so was left clear of his property, and has no benefit from it at all.</b> Similarly, “but the owner of the ox shall be clear” means that he may not derive benefit from the ox.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it known <b>that</b> this phrase: <b>“Its flesh shall not be eaten,”</b> serves to teach a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where he slaughtered</b> the ox <b>after its verdict was reached,</b> but before it was stoned, and is teaching that one is <b>prohibited to eat</b> it? Why not <b>say that it is permitted to eat</b> the ox <b>if he slaughtered</b> it <b>after its verdict had been reached. And this</b> phrase: <b>“Its flesh shall not be eaten,”</b> serves to teach a <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where they</b> had already <b>stoned it,</b> but not to teach a prohibition against eating it, as that is already known due to the fact that it was stoned. Rather, it serves to prohibit deriving benefit from the ox, <b>and</b> that would be <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Abbahu.</b>
<b>As Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>wherever it is stated: “It shall not be eaten”;</b> or <b>“you,”</b> singular, <b>“shall not eat”; or “you,”</b> plural, <b>“shall not eat”; both a prohibition</b> against <b>eating and a prohibition</b> against deriving <b>benefit</b> are indicated. This is so <b>unless the verse specifies for you</b> that one may derive benefit, <b>in the manner that it specified for you with regard to an animal carcass,</b> from which the verse explicitly permits one to derive benefit.
The Gemara continues: This is so <b>unless the verse specifies for you</b> that one may derive benefit, <b>in the manner that it specified for you with regard to an animal carcass,</b> from which the verse explicitly permits one to derive benefit, as it states: “You may sell it to a foreigner” (Deuteronomy 14:21). Accordingly, it is permitted to transfer an unslaughtered animal carcass <b>to a <i>ger</i></b> <i>toshav</i>, i.e., a gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot, <b>through giving</b> it to him as a gift, <b>and to</b> any other <b>gentile through selling</b> it to him. Apparently, without this explicit permission, it would be prohibited to derive any benefit from a carcass, due to the prohibition: “You shall not eat.” Here, too, with regard to the ox that is stoned, the phrase: “Its flesh shall not be eaten,” may serve to teach that one may not derive benefit from the stoned ox.
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: <b>That statement</b> applies <b>where</b> both <b>the prohibition of eating and the prohibition of deriving benefit are derived from a verse</b> using an expression such as: <b>“It shall not be eaten.” But here, where the prohibition of eating is derived from</b> the statement: “The ox <b>shall be stoned,” if it enters your mind</b> that <b>this</b> expression: <b>“Its flesh shall not be eaten,” is</b> stated only in reference to the <b>prohibition of deriving benefit, let the Merciful One write</b> explicitly: <b>Benefit shall not be derived</b> from it. <b>Alternatively,</b> let the verse simply state: <b>“It shall not be eaten”; why do I</b> require the specific term: <b>“Its flesh”?</b> Clearly, the intention of the verse is to teach <b>that even if he has rendered it like</b> kosher <b>flesh by</b> properly <b>slaughtering it</b> after the verdict, one is still <b>prohibited</b> to eat it.
<b>Mar Zutra objects to this: Say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies

Daf 41b

only in a case <b>where he checked</b> a sharp piece of <b>flint, and,</b> seeing that it did not have any defects, <b>slaughtered</b> the ox <b>with it.</b> In that case, one could say <b>that</b> by slaughtering it with a stone, <b>he performed the equivalent to stoning.</b> Therefore, it is prohibited to eat it. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where he slaughtered it with a knife</b> made of metal, one is <b>not</b> prohibited from eating it.
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>it is written in the Torah</b> that slaughter must performed specifically with <b>a knife,</b> which would justify a distinction between slaughtering with a stone and a knife? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 15b): With regard to <b>one who slaughters with a hand-sickle, with</b> a piece of <b>flint, or with a reed,</b> if these implements were suitable to be used for slaughter, <b>his slaughter is valid?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to Rabbi Abbahu, <b>now that he derives the prohibition of eating and the prohibition of deriving benefit from</b> the verse <b>“Its flesh shall not be eaten,” why do I</b> require the statement: <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear”?</b> The Gemara answers: This is stated <b>to</b> prohibit <b>deriving benefit from its hide</b> after it has been killed; <b>as it could enter your mind to say that it is</b> specifically <b>its flesh from which it is prohibited to derive benefit,</b> as the verse states: “Its flesh shall not be eaten,” but <b>deriving benefit from its hide will be permitted.</b> Therefore, the Torah <b>teaches us</b> that <b>the owner of the ox shall be clear,</b> to indicate it is prohibited to derive benefit from any part of the ox.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to those <i>tanna’im</i> who expound this</b> verse: <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear,” for another interpretation, as we wish to state below, from where do they derive</b> this prohibition against <b>deriving benefit from</b> the ox’s <b>hide?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from</b> the wording: <b>“Its flesh</b> may not be eaten [<i>velo ye’akhel <b>et besaro</b></i><b>].”</b> The verse could have been formulated: <i>Velo ye’akhel besaro</i>, which already means: And its flesh shall not be eaten. The addition of the word “<i>et</i>” teaches that the prohibition applies also to <b>that which is secondary to the flesh.</b> And <b>what is that?</b> That is <b>its hide.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>And this <i>tanna</i>,</b> who derives it from the statement: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,” <b>does not interpret</b> the word <b>“<i>et</i>”</b> as a means to derive new <i>halakhot</i>. He considers the word “<i>et</i>” to be an ordinary part of the sentence structure and not a source for exegetical exposition.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Shimon HaAmasoni, and some say</b> that it was <b>Neḥemya HaAmasoni, would interpret all</b> occurrences of the word <b>“<i>et</i>” in the Torah,</b> deriving additional <i>halakhot</i> with regard to the particular subject matter. <b>Once he reached</b> the verse: <b>“You shall fear the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:13), which is written with the added word “<i>et</i>,” <b>he withdrew</b> from this method of exposition, as whose fear could be an extension of the fear of God? <b>His students said to him: Our teacher, what will be with all</b> the occurrences of the word <b>“<i>et</i>” that you interpreted</b> until now? <b>He said to them: Just as I received reward for the exposition, so I received reward for</b> my <b>withdrawal</b> from using this method of exposition.
The word “<i>et</i>” in this verse was not explained <b>until Rabbi Akiva came and expounded: “You shall fear the Lord your God”:</b> The word “<i>et</i>” serves <b>to include Torah scholars,</b> i.e., that one is commanded to fear them just as one fears God. In any event, Shimon HaAmasoni no longer derived additional <i>halakhot</i> from the word <i>et</i>.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: <b>“But the owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> It means that <b>he shall be clear from paying half a ransom.</b> Although the owner of an innocuous ox that causes damage is liable to pay half the cost of the damage, if an ox kills a person its owner is not liable to pay any ransom.
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to him:</b> Why is it necessary for the verse to teach this? <b>But isn’t</b> compensation for damage caused by an innocuous ox <b>itself</b> anyway <b>paid only from</b> the value of <b>its body?</b> Here too, its owner can say to the claimant: <b>Bring it to court and it will pay you,</b> i.e., you will be paid from its value. Since the ox is stoned, there is nothing from which he can receive payment. Therefore, according to your interpretation, the verse does not introduce any <i>halakha</i> that could not have been inferred by logic, and is therefore superfluous.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: Is this how I</b> appear <b>in your eyes, that my derivation</b> from the verse is <b>in</b> reference to <b>this</b> case, that of an ox <b>that is liable</b> to be put to <b>death?</b> Obviously no verse would be required to teach this <i>halakha</i> in such a case. <b>My derivation is only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the assumption that the ox <b>killed a person</b> is <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness, or</b> is <b>based on</b> the admission of <b>the owner.</b> Such proof is not sufficient for the ox to be put to death by stoning, but one might have thought that it is sufficient to require its owner to pay ransom.
The Gemara asks: If it is <b>based on</b> the admission of <b>the owner,</b> he clearly would not be liable to pay ransom, since <b>he</b> would be <b>admitting to</b> an act that results in <b>a fine,</b> in which case a person is exempt from paying the fine; so why would it be necessary for the verse to state this exemption?
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Eliezer <b>holds</b> that <b>ransom</b> is for the purpose of <b>atonement,</b> and is not considered a fine. Accordingly, one might have assumed that even in a case where there is not conclusive testimony, the owner must pay ransom to atone for the killing. Therefore, the verse states that in the case of an innocuous ox, the owner is not liable to pay half a ransom.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: Akiva, is this how I</b> appear <b>in your eyes, that my derivation</b> from the verse is <b>in</b> reference to <b>this</b> case, that of an ox <b>that is liable</b> to be put to <b>death? My derivation is only</b> with regard to a case <b>where</b> the ox <b>intended to kill an animal but killed a person</b> instead; or where it intended <b>to</b> kill <b>a gentile but killed a Jew;</b> or where it intended <b>to</b> kill <b>a non-viable baby but killed a viable person.</b> An ox is not put to death if it intended to gore in a manner which would not render it liable to be put to death, even if it did gore in such a manner. In such a case, the owner of the ox must pay ransom. Therefore, the verse states that if it is an innocuous ox, the owner is exempt from paying half a ransom.
These two <i>baraitot</i> cite different responses that Rabbi Eliezer gave Rabbi Akiva. <b>Which</b> one of these explanations <b>did he say to him first? Rav Kahana said in the name of Rava: He first said to him</b> the explanation referring to the ox’s <b>intention</b> to kill someone for which it would not be liable to be put to death, and subsequently gave him the second explanation with regard to the testimony of a single witness, or the owner’s admission. <b>Rav Tavyumei said in the name of Rava: He first said to him</b> the explanation that it is a case where the assumption that the ox <b>killed</b> was based on one witness or its owner’s admission.
The Gemara explains the reasoning behind the two opinions: <b>Rav Kahana said in the name of Rava</b> that <b>first he said to him</b> the explanation involving the ox’s <b>intention,</b> since this opinion is preferable to the other one, against which a difficulty was raised earlier. This is <b>analogous to a fisherman pulling fish from the sea.</b>

Daf 42a

When <b>he finds big ones he takes</b> them, and when he finds <b>small ones he takes</b> them as well. Here too, although Rabbi Eliezer’s first explanation was sufficient, he added an additional response, despite the fact that it was not as good as the first.
By contrast, <b>Rav Tavyumei said in the name of Rava</b> that <b>he first said to him</b> the explanation involving inconclusive testimony asserting that the ox <b>killed,</b> since this is <b>analogous to a fisherman pulling fish from the sea,</b> who <b>finds small ones</b> and <b>takes</b> them, and when he then <b>finds big ones, he discards the small ones and takes</b> only <b>the big ones.</b> Here too, once Rabbi Eliezer thought of a better response to Rabbi Akiva’s question, he suggested it instead of the first.
§ <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b> It means he shall be <b>clear from</b> paying <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring.</b> In other words, if an innocuous ox causes a woman to miscarry, the owner is not liable to pay half the compensation for the miscarried offspring.
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to him:</b> It is unnecessary for the verse to teach this. <b>Doesn’t it say</b> with regard to paying compensation for miscarried offspring: <b>“If men struggle and hurt a</b> pregnant <b>woman</b> and her offspring emerge, and there is no tragedy, he shall be punished as the husband of the woman shall impose upon him and he shall give as the judges determine” (Exodus 21:22); from which it is inferred that <b>men</b> who cause a woman to miscarry are liable to pay compensation for the offspring, <b>but</b> the owner of <b>oxen</b> who cause a woman to miscarry is <b>not</b> liable?
The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Akiva is saying well;</b> he states a reasonable objection. What would Rabbi Yosei HaGelili have responded to him?
<b>Rav Ulla, son of Rav Idi, said: It was necessary</b> for the verse to teach this exemption, as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that this inference should be limited, as follows: <b>Men</b> are liable to pay compensation for miscarried offspring, <b>but</b> the owner of <b>oxen that are comparable to men</b> is <b>not</b> liable. Only some oxen are excluded from this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Just as men are</b> categorically considered <b>forewarned, so too</b> the <b>oxen,</b> which are contrasted with men in this case, <b>are</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> as well. <b>But</b> in the case of miscarriage caused by <b>an innocuous</b> ox, its owner <b>would be liable</b> to pay compensation for miscarried offspring. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote</b> with regard to an innocuous ox: <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> to teach us <b>that</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability.
<b>Rava said,</b> in objection to this answer: <b>The native is on the ground and the stranger is in the heavens!</b> The aforementioned suggestion contradicts the principle that the <i>halakha</i> of a forewarned ox is more stringent than that of an innocuous ox.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different way for Rabbi Yosei HaGelili to counter Rabbi Akiva’s objection: <b>It was necessary</b> for the verse to teach this exemption, as otherwise it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that only <b>men</b> are liable to pay for miscarried offspring, <b>but</b> the owner of <b>oxen that are comparable to men</b> is <b>not</b> liable. <b>Just as men are</b> categorically considered <b>forewarned, so too</b> the <b>oxen,</b> which are contrasted with men in this case, <b>are</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> as well. <b>And for</b> miscarriage caused by <b>innocuous oxen,</b> their owners <b>are</b> also <b>exempt</b> due to an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. <b>The Merciful One then wrote</b> that <b>the owner of the</b> innocuous <b>ox shall be clear,</b> indicating that only for <b>an innocuous</b> ox is one <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation for miscarried offspring, <b>but</b> for <b>a forewarned</b> ox the owner is <b>liable.</b>
<b>Abaye said to him: If that is so,</b> then <b>with regard to</b> compensation for <b>humiliation,</b> which is derived from the verse: “When men struggle together, a man and his brother, and the wife of one drew near to deliver her husband from the hand of the one who smites him, and extended her hand, and grabbed his genitals” (Deuteronomy 25:11), <b>let us say this as well:</b> Only <b>men</b> are liable to pay for humiliation, <b>but</b> the owner of <b>oxen that are comparable to men</b> is <b>not</b> liable. <b>Just as men are</b> categorically considered <b>forewarned, so too</b> the <b>oxen,</b> which are contrasted with men in this case, <b>are</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> as well. <b>And for</b> humiliation caused by <b>innocuous oxen,</b> their owners <b>are</b> also <b>exempt</b> due to an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference. <b>The Merciful One then wrote</b> that <b>the owner of the</b> innocuous <b>ox shall be clear,</b> indicating that only for <b>an innocuous</b> ox is one <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation for humiliation, <b>but</b> for <b>a forewarned</b> ox the owner is <b>liable.</b>
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed</b> that is the <i>halakha</i> according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, <b>if so, let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> that with regard to the verse: <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear,” Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: He is exempt</b> both <b>from</b> paying <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring and from</b> paying compensation for <b>humiliation.</b>
Rava then retracted this explanation of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s opinion. <b>Rather, Abaye and Rava both say</b> that Rabbi Akiva’s inference is correct, according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, but with regard to the continuation of the verse: “But if any harm follows, you shall give life for life” (Exodus 21:22). With regard to <b>men,</b> if <b>there is no harm</b> caused <b>to the woman,</b> i.e., she is not killed, <b>they shall be punished</b> financially and are liable to pay compensation for miscarried offspring. But if <b>there is harm</b> caused <b>to the woman</b> and she dies, <b>they shall not be punished</b> financially, as they are liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. This distinction applies only with regard to men <b>but not</b> with regard to <b>oxen, as even if there is harm</b> caused to the woman, the owners <b>shall be punished</b> financially. In order to preclude this inference, <b>the Merciful One then wrote: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> to teach <b>that</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation for miscarried offspring.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava objects to this: Is that to say</b> that <b>the issue</b> of financial liability <b>is dependent on</b> whether or not there was <b>harm</b> caused to the woman? Clearly, <b>the issue is dependent on the intent</b> to strike the woman.
<b>Rather, Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> a different inference: With regard to <b>men,</b> in a case <b>where they intended to</b> strike <b>each other, even if there is harm</b> caused <b>to the woman,</b> i.e., she dies, <b>they shall be punished</b> financially, and are liable to pay compensation for miscarried offspring. But <b>when they intended to</b> strike <b>the woman herself they shall not be punished</b> financially, as they are liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. <b>But</b> this distinction does <b>not</b> apply with regard to <b>oxen, as even if they intended to</b> strike <b>the woman herself,</b> their owners <b>shall be punished.</b> In order to preclude this inference, <b>the Merciful One wrote: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> to teach <b>that</b> the owners are <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation for miscarried offspring.
<b>And similarly, when Rav Ḥaggai came from the South, he came and brought a <i>baraita</i> in his hand</b> that interprets the verse <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Rav Adda bar Ahava.</b>
§ <b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear”</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> This statement teaches that if an innocuous ox kills a Canaanite slave, its owner shall be <b>clear from</b> paying <b>compensation for the slave,</b> unlike the case of a forewarned ox that killed a Canaanite slave, where the ox’s owner is liable.

Daf 42b

The Gemara asks: <b>But let Rabbi Akiva say to himself</b> the same objection that he raised against Rabbi Eliezer’s interpretation of the verse, that the owner of an innocuous ox is exempt from paying half a ransom (see 41b): Why is it necessary for the verse to teach this? <b>But isn’t</b> compensation for damage caused by an innocuous ox <b>itself paid only from</b> the value of <b>its body?</b> Therefore, its owner can say to the slave’s owner: <b>Bring it to court and you will be paid from it.</b> Since the ox was stoned, there is nothing from which he can collect payment.
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak said:</b> Rabbi Akiva’s interpretation is applicable in a case <b>where its owner slaughtered it first,</b> before it was sentenced to stoning. <b>Lest you say</b> that the slave’s owner <b>should be paid from</b> the value of the flesh, the verse <b>teaches us</b> that <b>since</b> the ox <b>was subject to be killed, although</b> its owner <b>slaughtered it,</b> the slave’s owner <b>should not be paid from it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> why did Rabbi Akiva raise this objection against Rabbi Eliezer’s interpretation? <b>According to Rabbi Eliezer as well,</b> it could be explained as referring to a case <b>where</b> its owner <b>slaughtered it first.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Indeed,</b> Rabbi Eliezer’s interpretation could also be explained in this manner. <b>And</b> the reason Rabbi Akiva raised this objection was because <b>he reasons: Perhaps</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>has another explanation that is better than this one, and will state it.</b> Rabbi Eliezer did in fact respond with another explanation.
The Gemara asks: <b>But let Rabbi Eliezer also answer him that</b> the owner <b>slaughtered it first.</b> Why did he offer a different explanation? The Gemara answers that Rabbi Eliezer could have <b>said to you: Specifically there,</b> in the case Rabbi Eliezer referred to in his explanation, namely, <b>where</b> the ox <b>intended to kill</b> another <b>animal but killed a person</b> instead, <b>since the ox was not subject to be killed at all,</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>he should be liable</b> to pay half a ransom from the ox’s body. Therefore, <b>the verse is necessary to exclude</b> the owner from liability to pay half a ransom. <b>But here, since</b> the ox <b>was initially subject to be killed, a verse is not necessary</b> to teach that the owner is exempt from paying half a ransom <b>even if he slaughtered it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according <b>to Rabbi Akiva also, certainly it is so,</b> that a verse is not necessary to teach that if the owner slaughters the ox before its verdict he is exempt from liability.
<b>Rather, Rav Asi said:</b> The above explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s interpretation should be rejected, as <b>I heard this</b> following <b>statement from a great man, and who is he?</b> He is <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina.</b> This is what he said: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since Rabbi Akiva says</b> in the mishna (33a) that in a case where a person and an innocuous ox damaged each other concurrently, the owner of <b>an innocuous</b> ox <b>that injured a person also pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage with regard to the difference</b> between the two valuations of the damage, as there is no distinction between an innocuous ox and a forewarned ox with regard to injuries caused to a person, <b>compensation for the slave is also paid from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, not from the body of the ox; just as in a case where a forewarned ox kills a slave. Therefore, its owner cannot say: Bring it to court and you will be paid from it. To counter this possibility, <b>the Merciful One wrote: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> indicating that he is exempt from this liability.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rav Asi: But didn’t Rabbi Akiva</b> already <b>break</b> the force of <b>his fist,</b> i.e., qualify this opinion of his? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that the owner of an innocuous ox that injured a person <b>pays</b> compensation <b>from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, the same as the owner of a forewarned ox. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “According to this judgment shall be done to him [<i>lo</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:31), indicating that <b>he pays</b> restitution exclusively <b>from</b> the <b>body</b> of the ox <b>but he does not pay from</b> his <b>superior-quality</b> property, as the word <i>lo</i> also means: To it. This negates Rav Asi’s explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s interpretation.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different explanation of Rabbi Akiva’s statement: The verse is <b>necessary</b> because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since I,</b> referring to the Torah, <b>am more stringent with regard to</b> a forewarned ox that kills a person in the case of a Canaanite <b>slave than</b> in the case of <b>a freeman; as</b> in the case of <b>a freeman</b> who was <b>worth</b> one <b><i>sela</i></b> the owner of the ox <b>gives</b> one <b><i>sela</i></b> in ransom, and if he was worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> <b>he gives thirty; but</b> in the case of a Canaanite <b>slave</b> the Torah imposes a fixed amount, so even if he was <b>worth</b> only one <b><i>sela</i></b> the owner <b>gives thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, therefore, since the Torah is more stringent in the case of a slave, <b>payment for the slave should also be paid from</b> the owner’s <b>superior-quality</b> property. To counter this, <b>the Merciful One writes: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> indicating that payment is not required in a case where an innocuous ox kills a slave.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Rava</b> to Rabbi Akiva’s statement. The <i>baraita</i> states that with regard to the verse <b>“The owner of the ox shall be clear,” Rabbi Akiva says:</b> He shall be <b>clear from payment for</b> a Canaanite <b>slave.</b>
Rabbi Akiva discusses this interpretation: <b>And</b> could this <i>halakha</i> <b>not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference,</b> without the verse? <b>Since</b> the Torah <b>deemed</b> him <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for</b> the killing of <b>a slave and deemed</b> him <b>liable for</b> the killing of <b>a freeman</b> as well, <b>just as when</b> the Torah <b>deemed</b> him <b>liable for a freeman you distinguished between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox, as no ransom is paid in the case of an innocuous ox, <b>so too, when</b> the Torah <b>deemed</b> him <b>liable for a slave, let us distinguish between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox.
<b>Furthermore,</b> this <i>halakha</i> could be proven through an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If,</b> in the case of <b>a freeman, where he,</b> the owner, <b>gives his full value, you distinguished between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox, with regard to <b>a slave, where he gives only thirty</b> <i>sela</i> and not more, even if the slave was worth more, <b>is it not logical that we should distinguish between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox, and exempt him from liability for an innocuous ox?
Rabbi Akiva rejects this opinion: <b>No,</b> one could disagree and say the opposite: <b>I,</b> referring to the Torah, <b>am more stringent with regard to</b> the case of <b>a slave than</b> with regard to that of <b>a freeman; as</b> for <b>a freeman worth</b> one <b><i>sela</i>,</b> the ox’s owner <b>gives</b> only one <b><i>sela</i>,</b> and if he is worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i> <b>he gives thirty. But</b> in the case of <b>a slave,</b> even if he was <b>worth</b> only one <b><i>sela</i>, he gives thirty</b> <i>sela</i>. Therefore, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>he should be liable</b> to pay for a slave killed by his innocuous ox. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “The owner of the ox shall be clear,”</b> indicating that he shall be <b>clear from</b> paying <b>compensation for a slave.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states with regard to a forewarned ox: “But if the ox was a goring ox in time past and warning has been given to its owner, and he has not secured it; <b>and it killed a man or a woman;</b> the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:29). <b>Rabbi Akiva said: And what does this come to teach us? If</b> it is <b>to deem</b> the owner <b>liable for</b> the killing of <b>a woman</b> just <b>as</b> for the killing of <b>a man, this is already stated</b> with regard to an innocuous ox, where it is stated: <b>“When an ox gores a man or a woman,</b> and they die, the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:28).
<b>Rather,</b> the verse is stated <b>to compare a woman to a man</b> with regard to another issue: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>a man,</b> payment for <b>his injuries</b> is paid <b>to his heirs, so too,</b> with regard to <b>a woman,</b> payment for <b>her injuries</b> is paid <b>to her heirs,</b> and not to her husband.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Akiva hold</b> that <b>a husband does not inherit</b> from his wife? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And he shall inherit it [<i>otah</i>]”</b> (Numbers 27:11). <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>that the husband inherits</b> from <b>his wife,</b> as <i>otah</i> also means: Her. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>
<b>Reish Lakish said:</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>says</b> that her heirs and not her husband receive the payment <b>only with regard to ransom, since it is paid only posthumously and is</b> therefore <b>considered</b> property <b>due</b> to her; <b>and the husband does not take</b> in inheritance the property <b>due</b> to the deceased <b>as</b> he does the property she <b>possessed.</b> For instance, an inheritance that would have gone to the woman had she been alive is not awarded to the husband, but rather, to her other heirs.
<b>What is the reason</b> for the assumption that even if it is clear that the victim is about to die, the husband is not owed ransom? <b>The verse states: “And it killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. If a ransom is laid on him,</b> then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatsoever is laid on him” (Exodus 21:29–30), indicating that the owner’s liability to pay ransom is dependent on the ox’s liability to be stoned, which, in turn, applies only after the death of the victim.
The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to damages, did Rabbi Akiva not say</b> that damages due to a wife are paid to her heirs and not to her husband, just as with regard to ransom?
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If an assailant <b>struck the woman and her offspring emerged</b> due to miscarriage, <b>he gives</b> compensation for <b>damage and pain to the woman and compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring to the husband.</b> If <b>the husband is not</b> alive, <b>he gives</b> the compensation for the offspring <b>to his heirs.</b> If <b>the woman is not</b> alive, <b>he gives</b> the payment owed to her <b>to her heirs.</b> If <b>she was</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant and</b> then <b>she was emancipated,</b>

Daf 43a

and subsequently married a Canaanite slave who had also been emancipated, and became pregnant from him, <b>or</b> if she was <b>a convert</b> who became pregnant from a male convert, and both the husband and wife died without heirs, the assailant <b>gains</b> by not having to pay, since there are no heirs. In any event, it is explicitly stated in the <i>baraita</i> that the beneficiary of the compensation due to her, including that which she would have received during her lifetime, is not her husband but rather her heirs.
<b>Rabba said:</b> This <i>baraita</i> relates <b>to a divorcée;</b> since they got divorced, the husband does not inherit from her. <b>Likewise, Rav Naḥman said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> relates <b>to a divorcée.</b>
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: If she is <b>a divorcée,</b> she <b>should also share in</b> the <b>compensation for</b> the miscarried <b>offspring.</b> Why should her ex-husband receive the full payment?
<b>Rav Pappa said: The Torah awarded the</b> payment of <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring to the husband, even if he</b> is not actually her legal husband but rather <b>engaged in licentious sexual intercourse with her.</b> Although he has no rights to her property, the damages for the miscarried offspring belong to him alone, as he is the father of the offspring. <b>What is the reason? The verse states: “As the husband [<i>ba’al</i>] of the woman shall impose upon him”</b> (Exodus 21:22), indicating that damages are not collected by the woman, but by the man who engaged in intercourse [<i>ba’al</i>] with her, impregnating her. Therefore, if they got divorced, the ex-husband receives the payment.
The Gemara asks: Why do Rabba and Rav Naḥman explain this <i>baraita</i> as referring to a divorcée? They could have answered, in accordance with their own opinions elsewhere (<i>Bava Batra</i> 124b), that it is referring to payments that are not considered to have been in the woman’s possession during her lifetime, but rather are considered property due to the woman, which her husband does not inherit. <b>Let us establish</b> this <i>baraita</i>, according <b>to Rabba,</b> as referring to a case <b>where they collected money</b> for the damage and pain, <b>and</b> according <b>to Rav Naḥman, where they collected land.</b>
<b>As</b> with regard to the right of a firstborn to receive a double portion of the inheritance of his father, he receives a double portion only of the property possessed by his father, not of the property due to him. In a case where money was owed to the father, <b>Rabba says:</b> If the heirs <b>collected</b> the debt from <b>land,</b> the firstborn <b>has</b> the right to a double portion, since it is considered property that was already in the father’s possession. If <b>they collected money, he does not have</b> a double portion, as it is considered property due to the father. <b>And Rav Naḥman says:</b> If <b>they collected money, he has</b> a double portion, and if <b>they collected land, he does not have</b> a double portion.
The Gemara answers: <b>That statement</b> applies <b>according to the residents of the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who limit the rights of a firstborn to his father’s property to the extent that they hold he does not receive a double portion of any appreciation in the property occurring after his father’s death.
By contrast, <b>when they state</b> that this <i>baraita</i> <b>here</b> relates to a divorcée, it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi that the firstborn receives a double portion even in the appreciation of the property occurring after the father’s death. According to this opinion, clearly everything due to the father is considered to be in his possession, whether he receives his compensation in money or in land. The same applies to a husband, who inherits the rights to inherit compensation for damage and pain inflicted on his wife. That is why Rabba and Rav Naḥman had to interpret this <i>baraita</i> as relating to a divorcée.
§ <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> With regard to <b>an ox that killed</b> a Canaanite <b>slave unintentionally,</b> the owner is <b>exempt from</b> paying the fine of <b>thirty shekels, as it is stated: “He shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned”</b> (Exodus 21:32). It is derived from the verse that the liability to pay thirty shekels is dependent on the stoning of the ox; <b>whenever the ox is</b> liable <b>to</b> be killed by <b>stoning, the owner pays thirty shekels</b> as compensation for the damage. If <b>the ox is not</b> liable <b>to</b> be killed by <b>stoning,</b> e.g., if it killed unintentionally, <b>the owner does not pay thirty shekels.</b>
Similarly, <b>Rabba says:</b> With regard to <b>an ox that killed a freeman unintentionally,</b> its owner <b>is exempt from</b> paying <b>ransom; as it is stated: “The ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. If a ransom is laid on him”</b> (Exodus 21:29–30). This indicates that <b>whenever the ox is</b> liable <b>to</b> be killed by <b>stoning the owner pays ransom;</b> and if <b>the ox is not</b> liable <b>to</b> be killed by <b>stoning the owner does not pay ransom.</b>
<b>Abaye raised an objection to</b> Rabba’s statement from a mishna: If a person admits: <b>My ox killed so-and-so, or:</b> My ox killed <b>the ox of so-and-so, this</b> owner <b>pays based on his own</b> admission (<i>Ketubot</i> 41a). This cannot be referring to the payment of a fine, as a person who admits his responsibility for an act incurring a fine is exempt from paying the fine. Clearly, it must be referring to a payment for which one can render himself liable through admission. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to the payment of <b>ransom?</b> If so, this proves that payment of ransom is not dependent on whether the ox is liable to be killed by stoning, as the ox cannot be killed based on its owner’s admission alone.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring to payment of the monetary <b>value</b> of the victim. Although he is not liable to pay ransom, as the ox is not killed, nevertheless, since by his own admission his ox caused damage, he is liable to pay damages.
Abaye challenged this answer: <b>If</b> it is referring to the <b>value</b> of the victim, <b>say the latter clause</b> of that mishna: If a person admits: <b>My ox killed the</b> Canaanite <b>slave of so-and-so, he does not pay based on his own</b> admission. <b>And if,</b> as you claim, the mishna is referring to the <b>value</b> of the victim, not to the thirty-shekel fine, <b>why</b> should he <b>not</b> pay?
Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>I could have answered you</b> by saying that <b>the former clause,</b> which discusses an ox killing a freeman, is referring to the <b>value</b> of the victim, <b>and the latter clause,</b> which relates to an ox that gored a slave, is referring to payment of the thirty-shekel <b>fine. But I will not answer you with a forced answer.</b> Instead, I will answer as follows: Both <b>this</b> clause <b>and that</b> clause refer to the <b>value</b> of the victim;

Daf 43b

<b>but</b> there is a distinction between the two cases. With regard to an ox killing <b>a freeman,</b> there is a scenario <b>where</b> the owner <b>pays ransom based on his own</b> admission. <b>And what are the circumstances? If witnesses came and testified that</b> the ox <b>killed</b> a freeman and is therefore liable to be killed by stoning, <b>but they did not know whether it was innocuous</b> or <b>if it was forewarned, and its owner said that it was forewarned.</b> In this case, the owner <b>pays ransom based on his own</b> admission, since the ox is liable to be killed, and the ransom is for atonement and does not constitute a fine. Therefore, even <b>where there are no witnesses,</b> and the ox is therefore not liable to be killed by stoning for killing a person, nevertheless, the owner at least <b>pays</b> the monetary <b>value</b> of the victim based on his admission.
By contrast, <b>with regard to</b> an ox killing <b>a slave,</b> there is a scenario <b>where</b> one <b>does not pay the fine</b> of thirty shekels <b>based on his own</b> admission. <b>And what are the circumstances</b> where one would be liable to pay this fine due to his own admission? <b>If witnesses came and testified that</b> the ox <b>killed</b> a slave, <b>but they did not know whether it was innocuous</b> or <b>if it was forewarned, and its owner said that it was forewarned.</b> In this case, even though the ox is liable to be killed, the owner <b>does not pay the fine based on his own</b> admission, due to the principle that one does not pay a fine based on his own admission. Therefore, in a case <b>where there are no witnesses, he does not</b> even <b>pay</b> the <b>value</b> of the victim based on his own admission.
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> that states a principle: In <b>any</b> scenario <b>where</b> a person is <b>liable for</b> his ox killing <b>a freeman,</b> he is <b>liable for</b> his ox killing a Canaanite <b>slave, whether with regard to</b> liability to pay <b>ransom or with regard to</b> the ox being put to <b>death.</b>
The wording of the <i>baraita</i> is unclear: <b>Is there a ransom</b> to be paid <b>in</b> the case of <b>a slave?</b> Ransom is paid only for the killing of a freeman. <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to payment of the <b>value</b> of the victim? This poses a difficulty for Rabba’s opinion that one is not liable to pay the value of the victim for admitting to his ox’s killing of a slave.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>he,</b> Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak, <b>raised the objection and he resolved it,</b> and <b>there are</b> those <b>who say</b> it was <b>Rabba</b> who <b>said to him</b> in response, that <b>this is what</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching:</b> In <b>any</b> scenario <b>where</b> a person is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>ransom for</b> his ox killing <b>a freeman,</b> e.g., where it gored <b>intentionally based on</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>a fine for</b> his ox killing <b>a slave. And</b> in <b>any</b> scenario <b>where</b> one is <b>liable</b> to pay the <b>value</b> of the victim <b>for</b> his ox killing <b>a freeman,</b> e.g., where it gored <b>unintentionally based on</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses, for a slave</b> too, one is <b>liable</b> to pay the <b>value,</b> namely, where it gored <b>unintentionally based on</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses.</b> Accordingly, one does not pay the value of a slave based on his own admission, although he does pay the value of a freeman if he admits that his ox killed him.
<b>Rava said to</b> Rabba: <b>If that is so,</b> that one is liable to pay the value of the victim in cases where he is exempt from paying ransom, then if a person burns another to death <b>unintentionally</b> with <b>his fire,</b> and the proof is <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses, he should,</b> likewise, at least <b>pay</b> the <b>value</b> of the victim.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where does Rava</b> know <b>that he does not pay</b> the value of the victim if he started the fire unintentionally?
<b>If we say</b> that it is <b>from what we learned</b> in a mishna (61b): If one ignites a heap of grain and <b>there was a goat bound</b> to an item adjacent <b>to it, and</b> there was also <b>a slave adjacent to it</b> but not bound, <b>and</b> they were <b>burned</b> together <b>with</b> the heap of grain, he is <b>liable</b> to pay for the heap of grain and for the goat. If the <b>slave</b> was <b>bound to it</b> in such a way that he was unable to flee from the fire, <b>and</b> the <b>goat</b> was <b>adjacent to it, and</b> they were <b>burned with it,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability. Apparently, there is no liability even if he unintentionally burned the slave to death.
The Gemara comments: If this is Rava’s source, there is no proof from here. <b>Didn’t Reish Lakish say</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where he ignited the body of the slave</b> directly, in which case he is exempt from paying damages <b>because he receives the greater</b> punishment <b>of them?</b> Since he is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment for killing the slave, he is not liable to pay damages. Therefore, this does not serve as proof that one is not liable to pay the value of a fire victim.
<b>And</b> if Rava’s proof is <b>rather from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (10a): The <b>stringency that applies to Fire as opposed to Pit</b> is <b>that</b> the one responsible for <b>Fire is</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> with regard <b>to</b> its <b>consuming both something that is fitting for it and something that is not fitting for it,</b> i.e., both flammable and non-flammable items. <b>This is not so with regard to Pit,</b> as damages are not paid for everything that can be damaged by a pit. <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>does not teach: That</b> with regard to <b>Fire,</b> one is liable to <b>pay</b> the <b>value</b> of the victim even if the fire was ignited <b>unintentionally. This is not so with regard to Pit.</b> This would seem to support Rava’s opinion that one is not liable to pay the value of an unintentional victim of fire.
The Gemara comments: If this is Rava’s source, there is no proof from here. <b>Perhaps</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>taught</b> one distinction <b>and omitted</b> another; it simply did not enumerate all the differences.
<b>Rather,</b> Rava’s statement should not be understood as an objection to Rabba’s opinion, as <b>Rava himself had a dilemma</b> with regard to the matter: If a person burns another to death <b>unintentionally</b> with <b>his fire, does he pay</b> the <b>value</b> of the victim <b>or not?</b>
The Gemara elaborates on the question: <b>Do we say</b> that it <b>is specifically with regard to</b> death caused by one’s <b>ox, where</b> if it was done <b>intentionally he pays ransom</b> and <b>where</b> it was done <b>unintentionally he pays</b> the victim’s monetary <b>value</b> instead; <b>but</b> with regard to death caused by <b>his fire, where</b> even if it was done <b>intentionally he does not pay ransom,</b> if it was done <b>unintentionally he does not pay</b> the <b>value either? Or perhaps, since with regard to</b> the case where <b>his ox</b> gored <b>unintentionally, although there is no</b> liability to pay <b>ransom,</b> nevertheless, <b>he</b> at least <b>pays</b> the <b>value</b> of the victim. One should say that <b>with regard to his fire too, even though</b> in a case where it was done <b>intentionally he does not pay ransom,</b> when it was done <b>unintentionally, he should pay</b> the <b>value in any event.</b>
The Gemara concludes: <b>And we do not know</b> the solution to this dilemma, which <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ With regard to Rabba’s statement that for an ox that killed a person unintentionally one is exempt from paying ransom, the Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he reported that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It would have been sufficient for the verse to state: <b>“A ransom</b> is laid on him.” <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “If a ransom</b> is laid on him” (Exodus 21:30)? It is <b>to include</b> liability to pay <b>ransom</b> in a case where the ox killed <b>unintentionally,</b> just <b>as</b> one is liable to pay <b>ransom</b> when it killed <b>intentionally,</b> in contrast to Rabba’s opinion.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Dimi: <b>If</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s interpretation <b>is so,</b> it should be implemented with regard to the fine for a Canaanite <b>slave as well,</b> and it would have been sufficient for the verse to state: The ox gores a slave or a maidservant, he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver. <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “If</b> the ox gores <b>a slave”</b> (Exodus 21:32)? It is <b>to include</b> liability in a case where the ox killed a Canaanite <b>slave unintentionally,</b> just <b>as</b> when it killed <b>a slave intentionally. And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed</b> this is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>but doesn’t Reish Lakish say</b> that for <b>an ox that killed a slave unintentionally</b> its owner is <b>exempt from</b> paying the <b>thirty shekels?</b>
Rav Dimi <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Are you setting</b> the statement of one <b>man against</b> the statement of another <b>man?</b> It could be that although Reish Lakish maintains that he is exempt, Rabbi Yoḥanan holds that he is liable.
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he confirmed that this is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> as he <b>says</b> that it would have been sufficient for the verse to state: “The ox gores a <b>slave.” What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “If</b> the ox gores <b>a slave”?</b> It is <b>to include</b> liability in a case where the ox killed <b>a slave unintentionally,</b> just <b>as</b> when it killed <b>a slave intentionally.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>And</b> according <b>to Reish Lakish, let us say similarly</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that he does not interpret</b> the difference between the terms <b>“a slave”</b> and <b>“if a slave”</b> to derive an additional <i>halakha</i>, it may be inferred that <b>he does not interpret</b> the difference between the terms <b>“a ransom”</b> and <b>“if a ransom” either,</b> and holds that ransom is not paid if the incident was unintentional.
The Sages <b>said: No,</b> that is not a valid comparison. Although Reish Lakish <b>does not interpret</b> the difference between the terms <b>“a slave”</b> and <b>“if a slave,” he does interpret</b> the difference between the terms <b>“a ransom”</b> and <b>“if a ransom.”</b>
<b>And what is different</b> between the two verses? The terms <b>“a slave”</b> and <b>“if a slave” are not written where</b> the liability for <b>payment</b> is stated, but rather in the presentation of the case: “If the ox gores a slave.” Therefore, the use of the word “if” is warranted. By contrast, the terms <b>“a ransom”</b> and <b>“if a ransom” are written where</b> the liability for <b>payment</b> is stated, where it would have been sufficient for the verse to state: “A ransom is laid on him.” Therefore, the superfluous word “if” lends itself to interpretation to include liability to pay ransom even in a case where the killing was unintentional.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the same</b> <i>halakha</i> applies <b>in</b> a case where the ox killed <b>a boy or in</b> a case where it killed <b>a girl. The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter”</b> (Exodus 21:31), <b>to deem</b> the owner <b>liable for</b> the death of <b>minors</b> just <b>as for adults.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>And</b> could <b>this not</b> be derived through <b>logical inference? Since</b> the Torah <b>renders a person liable</b> to receive court-imposed capital punishment <b>for</b> killing another <b>person, and,</b> similarly, <b>renders an ox liable</b> to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a person,</b> it should be derived that <b>just as when</b> the Torah <b>renders a person liable for</b> killing <b>a person</b> the Torah makes <b>no distinction between</b> killing <b>minors and</b> killing <b>adults, so too, when it renders an ox liable</b> to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a person, do not differentiate with regard to it between minors and adults.</b>
<b>And furthermore, it</b> could be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If</b> in the case of <b>a person</b> killing <b>a person</b> the Torah <b>does not render minors</b> entirely <b>like adults with regard to this</b> act, inasmuch as minors are exempt from liability for killing, but nevertheless <b>it renders</b> a person <b>liable for</b> killing <b>minors</b> as well <b>as adults,</b>

Daf 44a

then in the case of <b>an ox</b> killing <b>a person, where</b> the Torah <b>renders small</b> oxen <b>like large</b> ones <b>with regard to this</b> act, as a young calf that kills a person is killed just as an adult ox that kills a person, <b>is it not logical that</b> the Torah <b>renders</b> it <b>liable for</b> killing <b>minors,</b> i.e., a boy or a girl, just <b>as</b> for killing <b>adults?</b> Why is it necessary for the verse to teach this <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>No,</b> this cannot be derived by logic alone. <b>If you say</b> that <b>a person</b> who kills <b>a person</b> is liable even when the victim is a minor, this may be due to the extra severity in the case of a human assailant, <b>as he is liable to</b> pay <b>four types of indemnity</b> for causing injury; pain, humiliation, medical costs, and loss of livelihood, in addition to payment for the actual damage. <b>Shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an ox, whose</b> owner <b>is not liable to</b> pay these <b>four types of indemnity?</b> Clearly, this <i>halakha</i> cannot be derived merely through logical comparison between the two cases. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter,” to render</b> it <b>liable for minors</b> as well <b>as adults.</b>
<b>And I have</b> derived this <i>halakha</i> <b>only with regard to forewarned</b> oxen; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>in</b> the case of <b>an innocuous</b> ox, it is killed if it kills a boy or a girl?
The <i>baraita</i> asks: Could this not be derived through <b>logical inference? Since</b> the Torah <b>renders</b> an ox <b>liable</b> to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a man or a woman, and</b> likewise <b>renders</b> it <b>liable</b> to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a boy or a girl;</b> then <b>just as when it renders</b> it <b>liable</b> to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a man or a woman you do not differentiate between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox, as both are stoned, <b>so too, when it renders</b> an ox <b>liable</b> to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a boy or a girl do not differentiate between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox.
<b>And furthermore,</b> it can be inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: If</b> with regard to <b>a man or a woman, whose power is diminished with regard to damages</b> because adults who cause damage are liable to pay, but nevertheless <b>you do not differentiate between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox that kills them; then with regard to <b>a boy or girl, whose power is enhanced with regard to damages</b> because they are not liable to pay for damage they cause, <b>is it not logical that you should not differentiate between an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox that kills them?
The <i>baraita</i> answers that <b>you could say</b> in response: <b>But does one derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a lenient</b> matter <b>from a stringent</b> matter <b>in order to</b> be more <b>stringent with regard to it? If</b> the Torah <b>is stringent with regard to</b> the case of <b>a forewarned</b> ox, <b>which is a stringent</b> matter, rendering it liable to be killed for killing a minor, does that mean that <b>you should be stringent with regard to an innocuous</b> ox, <b>which is</b> a relatively <b>lenient</b> matter?
<b>And furthermore,</b> there is another reason to reject the earlier opinion: <b>If you say</b> that an innocuous ox is liable to be killed <b>for</b> killing <b>a man or a woman, as they are obligated to</b> observe the <b>mitzvot,</b> which gives them importance, does that mean that <b>you should say</b> the same <b>with regard to a boy or a girl, who are exempt from the mitzvot?</b>
Since this <i>halakha</i> could not have been derived through logic alone, <b>the verse states: “Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter,”</b> stating the phrase “has gored” twice, to teach that it is referring both to the <b>goring of an innocuous</b> ox and to the <b>goring of a forewarned</b> ox, and both to <b>goring</b> that causes <b>death</b> and to <b>goring</b> that causes <b>injury.</b> In all these cases the owner of the ox is liable even if the ox gores a minor.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>an ox was rubbing against a wall, and</b> as a result the wall <b>fell on a person</b> and killed him; or if the ox <b>intended to kill</b> another <b>animal but killed a person;</b> or if it intended <b>to</b> kill <b>a gentile but killed a Jew;</b> or intended <b>to</b> kill <b>a non-viable baby but killed a viable person;</b> in all these cases the ox is <b>exempt</b> from being killed.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Shmuel says:</b> The ox is <b>exempt from</b> being put to <b>death,</b> since it did not intend to kill, <b>but</b> its owner is <b>liable to</b> pay <b>ransom. And Rav says:</b> They are <b>exempt from this</b> liability <b>and from that</b> liability.
The Gemara asks about Shmuel’s opinion: <b>And why</b> is he liable to pay ransom? <b>Isn’t</b> the ox <b>innocuous</b> with regard to this action? The Gemara answers: <b>As Rav says</b> in a different context, it is referring <b>to</b> an ox that was <b>forewarned with regard to falling on people in pits. Here too,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> an ox that was <b>forewarned with regard to rubbing against walls,</b> causing them to fall <b>on people.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if it was forewarned with regard to this behavior, it clearly intended to kill the person and <b>is</b> therefore <b>subject to</b> being put to <b>death,</b> contrary to the ruling in the mishna. The Gemara explains: <b>Granted there,</b> in the case where the ox was forewarned with regard to falling on people in pits, it could be <b>that it saw a vegetable</b> on the edge of the pit <b>and</b> subsequently <b>fell</b> in, without any intention to kill. <b>But here,</b> where it rubbed against a wall, causing it to fall on a person, and was forewarned with regard to this behavior, <b>what is there to say</b> in its defense?
The Gemara answers: <b>Here also</b> the case is <b>where it rubbed against the wall for its pleasure</b> and not in order to kill. The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we know</b> that it did not intend to kill? The Gemara answers: <b>Because</b> even <b>after</b> the wall <b>fell it was still rubbing against it,</b> which proves that this was its intention.

Daf 44b

The Gemara asks: <b>But still, is it</b> not a case of <b>pebbles?</b> Is this case not analogous to damage caused by pebbles inadvertently propelled from under the feet of an animal while it is walking, which is not considered damage caused directly by the ox, but rather, damage caused indirectly? Ransom is not imposed for such indirect killing. <b>Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, said:</b> It is a case <b>where</b> the wall <b>gradually gave way</b> under the pressure applied by the ox, and so while the ox was still pushing the wall it collapsed and killed the person.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel, and</b> this <i>baraita</i> is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav: There are</b> cases where the ox is <b>liable to</b> be put to <b>death and</b> the owner is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>ransom, and there are</b> cases where the owner is <b>liable to</b> pay <b>ransom but</b> the ox is <b>exempt from</b> being put to <b>death, and there are</b> cases where the ox is <b>liable to</b> be put to <b>death but</b> the owner is <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>ransom, and there are</b> cases where they are <b>exempt from this</b> punishment <b>and from that</b> one.
<b>How so?</b> In a case where <b>a forewarned</b> ox kills a person <b>intentionally,</b> the ox is <b>liable to</b> be put to <b>death and</b> the owner is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>ransom;</b> if <b>a forewarned</b> ox kills <b>unintentionally,</b> the owner is <b>liable to</b> pay <b>ransom but</b> the ox is <b>exempt from</b> being put to <b>death;</b> if <b>an innocuous</b> ox kills <b>intentionally,</b> the ox is <b>liable to</b> be put to <b>death but</b> the owner is <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>ransom;</b> and if <b>an innocuous</b> ox kills <b>unintentionally,</b> they are <b>exempt from this</b> punishment <b>and from that</b> one. The <i>baraita</i> states explicitly that although a forewarned ox that kills a person unintentionally is exempt from being put to death, its owner is liable to pay ransom, in accordance with Shmuel’s opinion, and in contrast with Rav’s opinion.
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And</b> for <b>injuries</b> caused by an ox <b>unintentionally,</b> from which the victim is not killed, <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the owner <b>liable</b> to pay for the injury <b>and Rabbi Shimon exempts</b> him.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to injury caused by the ox <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>its</b> owner’s <b>ransom</b> payment. <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>its</b> owner’s <b>ransom</b> payment he is <b>liable</b> even if the ox gores <b>unintentionally, so too,</b> with regard to <b>injuries</b> he is <b>also liable</b> even if it gores <b>unintentionally.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Shimon derives</b> his opinion <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the putting to <b>death of an ox</b> by the court: <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>its</b> being put to <b>death,</b> if it kills a person <b>unintentionally</b> it is <b>exempt, so too,</b> if it causes <b>injuries unintentionally</b> its owner is <b>exempt</b> from payment.
The Gemara questions the above explanation: <b>And let Rabbi Yehuda also derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning an ox unintentionally causing injury <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>its</b> being put to <b>death.</b> The Gemara answers: In his opinion, <b>we can derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>payment</b> for injury <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of ransom, which is another <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>payment. But we cannot derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>payment from</b> a <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>death.</b>
Conversely, the Gemara asks: <b>And let Rabbi Shimon also derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> here <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>its</b> owner’s <b>ransom</b> payment. The Gemara answers: <b>We can derive</b> a <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>liability of an ox from</b> a <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <b>liability of an ox, to the exclusion of</b> the payment of <b>ransom, which is the liability of the owner.</b> Compensation for injury is considered the ox’s liability, as it is the ox that caused the injury, whereas the ransom paid is for the owner’s atonement. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> concerning injury cannot be derived from the <i>halakha</i> of ransom, as they are dissimilar.
§ The mishna teaches that if an ox <b>intended to kill</b> another <b>animal but killed a person,</b> or if it intended to kill a person for whom it would not be liable to be put to death but killed a person for whom it would be liable, it is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara infers: If the ox <b>intended to kill this</b> person, for whom it would be liable, <b>but killed that</b> person instead, it is still <b>liable.</b> Accordingly, <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: Even</b> if the ox <b>intended to kill this</b> person <b>but killed that</b> person, it is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon?</b> The Gemara answers that it is <b>because the verse states: “The ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:29); the juxtaposition of the ox and its owner indicates that <b>as the death of the owner,</b> i.e., a person, for killing another person, <b>so</b> is <b>the death of the ox</b> for killing a person. In other words, the two <i>halakhot</i> are applied in the same circumstances. Specifically, <b>just as the owner,</b> i.e., a person, is not liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment <b>unless he intends</b> to kill the person whom he ultimately kills, <b>so too, an ox</b> is not put to death <b>either, unless it intends</b> to kill the one whom it ultimately kills.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the owner himself, from where do we</b> derive that he is not liable unless he killed the one whom he intended to kill? It is <b>as the verse states: “And he lay in wait for him, and rose against him,</b> and struck him mortally and he died” (Deuteronomy 19:11). From the term “for him,” Rabbi Shimon derives that the killer is not liable <b>unless he intends</b> to kill <b>him,</b> i.e., the one whom he ultimately killed.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what do the Rabbis,</b> who deem the killer liable in that case and who therefore disagree with Rabbi Shimon’s opinion, <b>do with this</b> phrase: <b>“And he lay in wait for him”?</b> How do they interpret it? The Gemara answers that the Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai say</b> that this phrase <b>excludes</b> from liability <b>one who throws a stone into</b> an area where there are several people, some of whom are people for whom he would not be liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, e.g., gentiles, and a stone killed a person for whom he would receive court-imposed capital punishment.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say that there are nine gentiles</b> in the crowd <b>and one Jew among them,</b> even without the verse <b>derive</b> the exemption from the fact <b>that a majority of them are gentiles. Alternatively,</b> even if <b>half</b> the people are gentiles <b>and half</b> are Jews, derive the exemption from the principle that when there is <b>uncertainty</b> concerning <b>capital law,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to</b> be <b>lenient.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the verse <b>is necessary</b> in a case <b>where there are nine Jews and one gentile. Although a majority of them are Jews,</b> the thrower is exempt from liability <b>because there is one gentile among them</b> who <b>is considered fixed</b> in his place, <b>and</b> the legal status of <b>any</b> item <b>fixed</b> in its place <b>is like</b> that of an uncertainty that is <b>equally balanced; and</b> when there is <b>uncertainty</b> concerning <b>capital law</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to</b> be <b>lenient.</b> This is what the Rabbis derive from the phrase: “And he lay in wait for him.”
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an ox belonging to a woman, and</b> similarly <b>an ox belonging to</b> orphans, and <b>an ox</b> belonging to orphans that is in the custody <b>of</b> their <b>steward,</b> and <b>a desert ox,</b> which is ownerless, and <b>an ox</b> that was <b>consecrated</b> to the Temple treasury, and <b>an ox belonging to a convert who died and has no heirs,</b> rendering the ox ownerless; all of <b>these</b> oxen <b>are liable</b> to be put to <b>death</b> for killing a person. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A desert ox, a consecrated ox,</b> and <b>an ox belonging to a convert who died are exempt from</b> being put to <b>death, since they have no owners.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the passage discussing an ox that kills a person (Exodus 21:28–32), the Torah states: <b>“An ox,” “an ox,”</b> repeating this word <b>seven</b> times, <b>to include</b> an additional six cases, in addition to the classic case of an ox goring and killing a person. They are: <b>An ox belonging to a woman, an ox belonging to orphans, an ox</b> belonging to orphans that is in the custody <b>of a steward, a desert ox, a consecrated ox,</b> and <b>an ox belonging to a convert who died and has no heirs. Rabbi Yehuda says: A desert ox, a consecrated ox,</b> and <b>an ox belonging to a convert who died and has no heirs are</b> all <b>exempt from</b> being put to <b>death, since they have no owners.</b>
<b>Rav Huna says: Rabbi Yehuda would deem</b> the ox <b>exempt even</b> if it <b>gored</b> and killed <b>and</b> its owner <b>ultimately consecrated</b> it, or if <b>it gored and he ultimately renounced</b> his <b>ownership</b> over it, since at the time of the trial in court the ox does not have an owner.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> did Rav Huna derive this assertion? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>teaches two</b> cases, <b>a desert ox and an ox belonging to a convert who died and has no heirs. What is</b> the legal status of <b>an ox belonging to a convert who died? Since he has no heirs it is considered to be an ownerless ox.</b> Accordingly, the case of <b>a desert ox is</b> the same as the case of <b>an ox belonging to a convert who died and has no heirs,</b> and it does not seem necessary for the <i>baraita</i> to state both cases. <b>Rather, does it not teach us this: That even if</b> the ox <b>gored and he ultimately consecrated</b> it, or, if <b>it gored and he ultimately renounced ownership</b> over it, it is exempt, just as in a case where a convert’s ox gores and subsequently the owner dies? The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that this is the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
<b>This</b> assertion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Moreover, Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>even if it gored and he ultimately consecrated</b> it, or if <b>it gored and he ultimately renounced ownership</b> over it, the ox is <b>exempt, as it is stated: “And warning has been given [<i>vehuad</i>] to its owner</b>…<b>and it killed</b>…the ox shall be stoned” (Exodus 21:29). It is derived from here that the owner of the ox is exempt <b>unless</b> the ox’s status as the owner’s property at the time of the <b>death</b> of the victim <b>and</b> at the time of the owner’s <b>standing trial is the same,</b> i.e., that the ox has an owner.
The Gemara asks: <b>But don’t we require</b> that the ox’s status be the same at the time of the <b>verdict</b> as well? <b>And isn’t</b> the phrase <b>“the ox shall be stoned”</b> also referring to the <b>verdict? Rather,</b> emend the statement and <b>say</b> that the owner of the ox is exempt <b>unless</b> the ox’s status as the owner’s property at the time of the <b>death</b> of the victim <b>and</b> at the time of the owner’s <b>standing trial and</b> at the time of <b>the verdict are identical as one.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>an ox that is leaving</b> court <b>to be stoned</b> for killing a person <b>and its owner</b> then <b>consecrated it, it is not</b> considered <b>consecrated,</b> i.e., the consecration does not take effect, since deriving benefit from the ox is prohibited and the ox is therefore worthless. If one <b>slaughtered it, its flesh is forbidden</b> to be eaten and it is prohibited to derive benefit from it. <b>But if its owner consecrated it before its verdict</b> the ox <b>is</b> considered <b>consecrated, and if he slaughtered it its flesh is permitted.</b>
If the owner of an ox <b>conveyed it to an unpaid bailee, or to a borrower,</b> or <b>to a paid bailee, or to a renter,</b> and it caused damage while in their custody, <b>they enter</b> into the responsibilities and liabilities <b>in place of the owner.</b> Therefore, if it was <b>forewarned</b> the bailee <b>pays the full</b> cost of the <b>damage, and</b> if it was <b>innocuous he pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>an ox that killed</b> a person, if its owner <b>sold it before its verdict,</b>

Daf 45a

<b>it is</b> considered legally <b>sold</b> and belongs to the purchaser for all purposes. Similarly, if <b>he consecrated it, it is</b> halakhically <b>consecrated,</b> and all the <i>halakhot</i> of consecrated property apply to it. If <b>he slaughtered it,</b> one <b>is permitted</b> to eat <b>its meat.</b> If <b>a bailee</b> charged with safeguarding it <b>returned it to its owner’s house</b> before the verdict <b>it is</b> considered to be <b>returned,</b> and the owner has no further claim against the bailee.
By contrast, <b>once its verdict has been issued,</b> if the owner <b>sells it, it is not</b> considered <b>sold,</b> since the ox is no longer his. Similarly, if <b>he consecrates it, it is not</b> considered <b>consecrated.</b> If <b>he slaughters it, its meat is forbidden.</b> If <b>a bailee returns it to its owner’s house it is not</b> considered to have been <b>returned,</b> since the ox is considered to have been killed. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says: Even once its verdict has been issued,</b> if <b>the bailee returns it to its owner it is</b> considered to have been <b>returned.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that they disagree about this: The Rabbis hold</b> that <b>with regard to items from which it is prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit one does not say: That which is yours is before you,</b> and no compensation is required. Once the deposited item was rendered forbidden, the bailee cannot return it as is to its owner, claiming that since it has not been physically damaged he has fulfilled his obligation to return it and therefore the owner has no further claims against him. <b>And Rabbi Ya’akov holds</b> that <b>one does say, with regard to items from which it is prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit: That which is yours is before you.</b>
<b>Rabba said:</b> Clearly, according <b>to everyone, one says with regard to items from which it is prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit: That which is yours is before you; as, if</b> this was the subject of disagreement, <b>let them dispute</b> this matter <b>with regard to leavened bread on Passover,</b> which is a more common case of an item from which it is prohibited to derive benefit.
<b>Rather, here they disagree with regard to</b> the matter of <b>issuing the verdict for an ox in its absence. The Rabbis hold that the verdict for an ox can be issued only in its presence.</b> Therefore, the bailee is not exempt by returning it after the verdict, <b>as</b> the owner <b>could say to him: If you had returned</b> the ox <b>to me</b> before the verdict <b>I would have smuggled it to the marsh,</b> and the court would not have been able to sentence it to stoning. <b>Now you</b> have <b>let my ox be seized by</b> the court, <b>with whom I cannot engage in litigation.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Ya’akov holds</b> that <b>the verdict for an ox can be issued in its absence.</b> Therefore, the bailee is exempt, <b>as he can say to</b> the owner in response to his claim: <b>Ultimately, they would have issued the verdict</b> anyway, so I did not cause your ox to be stoned by not returning it to you before the verdict.
According to this explanation, <b>what is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis</b> that the ox’s verdict can be issued only in its presence? The verse states: <b>“The ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 21:29), indicating that <b>as the death of the owner,</b> i.e., a person, for killing another person, <b>so</b> is <b>the death of the ox</b> for killing a person. <b>Just as the owner</b> is sentenced to death only <b>in his presence, so too, an ox</b> is sentenced to death only <b>in its presence.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Ya’akov</b> holds that the owner and the ox cannot be compared. <b>Granted, the owner</b> must be present when the verdict is issued, as people <b>are able to present claims</b> in their defense; <b>but</b> as for <b>an ox, is it capable of presenting claims?</b> Consequently, it makes no difference whether or not the verdict is issued in its presence.
§ The mishna teaches: If the ox’s owner <b>conveyed it to an unpaid bailee, or to a borrower, or</b> to a paid bailee, or to a renter, they enter into the responsibilities and liabilities in place of the owner. <b>The Sages taught:</b> There are <b>four</b> people who <b>enter into</b> the responsibilities and liabilities <b>in place of the owner, and they are: An unpaid bailee, and a borrower, a paid bailee, and a renter.</b> If the oxen <b>killed</b> people while in the possession of one of these people, if the oxen were <b>innocuous</b> at the time they killed, <b>they are killed and</b> the bailees are <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>ransom.</b> If they were <b>forewarned, they are killed and</b> the bailees <b>pay ransom. And</b> regardless if they were innocuous or forewarned, the bailees <b>are liable to return the value of the ox to its owner, with the exception of an unpaid bailee.</b>
The Sages <b>said: What are the circumstances</b> in which the bailees are liable, with the exception of an unpaid bailee? <b>If he safeguarded</b> the ox appropriately but the ox killed a person anyway, <b>all of the</b> other bailees <b>should also be exempt</b> from reimbursing the owner for the ox and not just an unpaid bailee, as they did everything that was required of them. <b>And if he did not safeguard it</b> properly, <b>even the unpaid bailee should be liable,</b> as he was also required to safeguard it.
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the bailee <b>provided reduced safeguarding and did not provide superior safeguarding.</b> In this case <b>the unpaid bailee has fulfilled his safeguarding</b> duties; since he does not receive anything in exchange this level of safeguarding is sufficient. <b>Those</b> other bailees, who have a greater responsibility, <b>have not fulfilled their</b> required level of <b>safeguarding.</b>
The Sages <b>said,</b> in clarification of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? <b>If it is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b>

Daf 45b

<b>who says</b> that <b>a renter is</b> considered <b>like an unpaid bailee</b> with regard to his responsibility for the rented item, <b>let it teach</b> that bailees are liable to compensate the owner, <b>with the exception of an unpaid bailee and a renter.</b>
<b>And if</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>a renter is</b> considered <b>like a paid bailee, let it teach: With the exception of an unpaid bailee,</b> as it in fact states; <b>but</b> it should also state that <b>in</b> a case where the oxen are <b>forewarned, all of them are exempt with regard to ransom,</b> as Rabbi Yehuda says in the next mishna that a forewarned ox requires only a reduced level of safeguarding. Therefore, this <i>baraita</i> does not appear to be in accordance with the opinion of either <i>tanna</i>.
<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says</b> that an ox <b>has no</b> sufficient <b>safeguarding</b> at all <b>other than</b> slaughtering it with <b>a knife;</b> i.e., there is no degree of safeguarding that exempts the ox’s owner, or in the context of the <i>baraita</i>, the bailee, from liability if the ox causes damage or kills. <b>And with regard to a renter,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>a renter is</b> considered <b>like a paid bailee.</b>
<b>Abaye said: Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir; and</b> it is <b>as Rabba bar Avuh reversed</b> the two opinions <b>and taught: How does a renter pay?</b> In other words, what is his degree of responsibility? <b>Rabbi Meir says: Like a paid bailee. Rabbi Yehuda says: Like an unpaid bailee.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If the owner <b>conveyed his ox to an unpaid bailee,</b> if the ox <b>caused damage,</b> the bailee is <b>liable</b> to pay damages; but if the ox <b>was injured,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
The Sages <b>said: What are the circumstances? If</b> Rabbi Elazar was referring to a bailee <b>who accepted</b> responsibility <b>upon himself</b> for <b>guarding it from</b> causing <b>damage, even</b> if the ox <b>was injured he should be liable. And if</b> he was referring to a bailee <b>who did not accept</b> responsibility for <b>guarding it from</b> causing <b>damage, even if it causes damage he should be exempt</b> from payment.
<b>Rava said: Actually,</b> Rabbi Elazar was referring to a case <b>where he accepted</b> responsibility <b>upon himself</b> for <b>guarding it from causing damage; but here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the bailee <b>recognized that</b> the ox <b>was a goring</b> ox, <b>and</b> in that case <b>the normal way of things is that</b> the bailee <b>accepted upon himself</b> responsibility for safeguarding it so <b>that it would not go and injure others,</b> since he knew that it was dangerous. But <b>it</b> presumably <b>did not enter his mind that other</b> oxen <b>would come and injure it.</b> Therefore, he did not accept responsibility for safeguarding against such an occurrence.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>the</b> ox’s <b>owner tied it with reins</b> to a fence <b>or locked</b> the gate <b>before it in an appropriate manner, but</b> nevertheless the ox <b>emerged and caused damage, whether</b> the ox is <b>innocuous or forewarned</b> the owner is <b>liable,</b> since this is not considered sufficient precaution to prevent damage; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that if the ox is <b>innocuous</b> the owner is <b>liable</b> even if he safeguarded it appropriately, since the Torah does not limit the required safeguarding for an innocuous ox. <b>But</b> if the ox is <b>forewarned,</b> the owner is <b>exempt</b> from paying compensation for damage, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse describing damage by a forewarned ox: <b>“And the owner has not secured it”</b> (Exodus 21:36), <b>and this</b> ox that was tied with reins or behind a locked gate <b>was secured.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> An ox <b>has no</b> sufficient <b>safeguarding</b> at all <b>other than</b> slaughtering it with <b>a knife;</b> there is no degree of safeguarding that exempts the ox’s owner from liability.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir? He holds</b> that <b>ordinary oxen are not presumed to be under safeguarding,</b> as their owners do not ordinarily safeguard them; <b>and the Merciful One stated</b> in the Torah that one <b>will be liable</b> even for damage caused by <b>an innocuous</b> ox inasmuch <b>as it requires</b> at least <b>a reduced</b> level of <b>safeguarding,</b> such as with reins. <b>The Merciful One then stated with regard to a forewarned</b> ox: <b>“And</b> the owner <b>has not secured it,”</b> to indicate that it is not sufficient to provide it with only a reduced level of safeguarding, <b>as it requires superior safeguarding. And</b> Rabbi Meir <b>derives</b> this requirement with regard to an innocuous ox from a verbal analogy between the term <b>goring</b> stated <b>with regard to an innocuous</b> ox and the term <b>goring</b> stated <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox. In both cases superior safeguarding is required; otherwise the owner is liable.
By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>ordinary oxen are presumed to be under</b> some reduced level of <b>safeguarding.</b> Since <b>the Merciful One stated</b> nevertheless that even for damage caused by <b>an innocuous</b> ox the owner <b>will pay,</b> it may be inferred <b>that it requires superior safeguarding. The Merciful One then states with regard to a forewarned</b> ox: <b>“And</b> the owner <b>has not secured it,”</b> emphasizing again <b>that one must provide it with superior safeguarding. This constitutes</b> one <b>amplification following</b> another <b>amplification, and</b> the principle is that <b>an amplification following an amplification is</b> stated <b>only</b> in order <b>to restrict</b> its extent. Accordingly, <b>the verse excludes</b> the requirement of <b>superior safeguarding</b> with regard to a forewarned ox, and therefore reduced safeguarding is sufficient to exempt the owner from liability.
<b>And if you would say</b> that through the verbal analogy between the term <b>goring</b> stated <b>with regard to an innocuous</b> ox and the term <b>goring</b> stated <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox the Torah compares their <i>halakhot</i>, nevertheless, <b>the Merciful One restricted</b> this <i>halakha</i> by emphasizing: <b>“And</b> the owner <b>has not secured it,”</b> referring specifically <b>to it,</b> a forewarned ox, <b>and not to the other,</b> i.e., innocuous, ox.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t this</b> phrase <b>necessary for the negative [<i>lav</i>]</b> statement that if the owner does not provide superior safeguarding he is liable? The Gemara answers: <b>If that is so, let the Merciful One write: And</b> the owner <b>has not secured. What</b> is the purpose of the added emphasis: <b>“And</b> the owner <b>has not secured it”?</b> It is to indicate that the restriction of this <i>halakha</i> relates specifically <b>to it,</b> a forewarned ox, <b>and not to the other,</b> i.e., innocuous, ox.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that there is a fourth opinion. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In the cases of <b>both an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox in <b>which</b> its owner <b>provided reduced safeguarding,</b> he is <b>exempt from liability.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for his opinion? <b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>reduced safeguarding is sufficient for a forewarned</b> ox, <b>and he derives</b> from the verbal analogy between the term <b>goring</b> stated <b>with regard to an innocuous</b> ox <b>and</b> the term <b>goring</b> stated <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox that just as reduced safeguarding is sufficient for a forewarned ox, it is sufficient for an innocuous ox as well.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said: Rabbi Yehuda deemed only the forewarned element of</b> the ox <b>exempt.</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s ruling that reduced safeguarding is sufficient to exempt the owner of a forewarned ox relates only to the additional half of the damage that is paid for a forewarned ox beyond the half of the damage that one is liable to pay for an innocuous ox. <b>But</b> the liability for its <b>element of innocuousness remains in place.</b> Therefore, if the owner did not provide superior safeguarding for the forewarned ox he is still liable to pay half the cost of the damage as he would if it were innocuous.
<b>Rav says:</b> If an ox is <b>forewarned with regard to</b> goring with its <b>right horn,</b> it <b>is not</b> thereby <b>forewarned with regard to</b> goring with its <b>left horn.</b>
The Sages <b>said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion is Rav’s statement made? <b>If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir, doesn’t</b> Rabbi Meir <b>say</b> that <b>both an innocuous</b> ox <b>and a forewarned</b> ox <b>require superior safeguarding? If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda, why</b> did he state that the ox still has an innocuous element <b>specifically</b> with regard to <b>the left horn? Even with regard to the right horn</b> itself it has both elements; <b>it has an element of innocuousness and it</b> also <b>has a forewarned element.</b>
The Sages <b>said: Actually,</b> Rav’s statement is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and he does not hold</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> that the ox’s innocuous element remains. <b>And this is what he is saying: You find an element</b> both <b>of innocuousness and of a forewarned</b> status in the same ox specifically <b>in a case like this,</b> where an ox is forewarned with regard to one horn but not with regard to the other.

Daf 46a

<b>But</b> if an ox is <b>entirely</b> rendered <b>forewarned, you do not find an element of innocuousness with regard to it at all.</b> If it is forewarned with regard to goring with either horn, its status of innocuousness is completely revoked.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> An ox <b>has no</b> sufficient <b>safeguarding</b> at all <b>other than</b> slaughtering it with <b>a knife. Rabba said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> It is <b>as the verse states</b> with regard to a forewarned ox: <b>“And</b> the owner <b>has not secured it”</b> (Exodus 21:36), meaning that once it is rendered forewarned the owner <b>no longer has</b> any sufficient manner of <b>safeguarding this</b> animal, and the owner is responsible for all damage it causes.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>If that is so,</b> does <b>that which is written</b> with regard to a pit: “And if a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit <b>and not cover it”</b> (Exodus 21:33), <b>also</b> mean that once a pit has been dug the owner <b>no longer has</b> any adequate way of <b>covering this</b> pit, which would exempt its owner from paying damages?
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed</b> that is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>but didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (52a) that if <b>he covered</b> the pit <b>appropri-ately, and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died,</b> he is <b>exempt?</b> Evidently, a pit can be covered adequately.
<b>Rather, Abaye</b> rejected Rabba’s explanation of Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion, and <b>said</b> that <b>this is</b> the <b>reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not raise a vicious dog in his house, and</b> that <b>one may not set up an unstable ladder in his house? As it is stated: “You shall not bring blood into your house”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:8), which means that one may not allow a hazardous situation to remain in his house. Similarly, a person should not keep a forewarned ox in his possession, as it is dangerous. This is why Rabbi Eliezer rules that no level of safeguarding is sufficient for it; the ox should be slaughtered so that it will not cause damage.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of an innocuous <b>ox that gored</b> and killed <b>a cow, and</b> the cow’s <b>fetus was found</b> dead <b>at its side, and it is not known whether</b> the cow <b>gave birth before</b> the ox <b>gored it</b> and the fetus’s death is unrelated to the goring or <b>whether it gave birth after</b> the ox <b>gored it</b> and the fetus died on account of the goring, the owner of the ox <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage for the cow and one-quarter</b> of the cost <b>of the damage for the offspring.</b> Since it is uncertain whether the ox was responsible for the death of the fetus, in which case he would pay half the damages, its owner pays only half the amount for the fetus that he would ordinarily be required to pay, i.e., one-quarter.
<b>And likewise,</b> there is uncertainty in the case of an innocuous <b>cow that gored an ox, and</b> the cow’s newborn <b>offspring was found at its side</b> dead or alive, <b>and it is not known whether</b> the cow <b>gave birth before it gored</b> the ox or <b>whether</b> the cow <b>gave birth after it gored.</b> When damage is caused by an innocuous animal, the liability of the owner is limited to the value of the animal that gored. Therefore, <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage is paid from</b> the value of <b>the cow,</b> as in the standard case of an innocuous animal. <b>And</b> if that does not suffice to pay for half the cost of the damage, <b>one-quarter of</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> is paid <b>from the offspring.</b> Since it is uncertain whether the offspring was part of the cow at the time the cow gored, the owner pays only half of what he would pay if it were certain that it was part of the cow.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: This</b> ruling in the mishna is <b>the statement of Sumakhos, who says: Property of uncertain ownership</b> is <b>divided</b> by the two parties. <b>But the Rabbis say</b> that <b>this is the significant principle of</b> monetary <b>law: The burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> and the disputed sum is not divided. According to the Rabbis, in the cases of uncertainty in the mishna, no payment is made for the fetus or from the offspring, respectively.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need for the Rabbis <b>to say</b> the words: <b>This is the significant principle of</b> monetary <b>law?</b> Why not just state the principle? The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to say them <b>because even</b> in a case where the <b>injured</b> party <b>states:</b> I am <b>certain</b> that such and such occurred, <b>and the one liable for the damage says: Perhaps</b> it was otherwise, without definitively refuting the claim against him, <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b> Although the injured party claims with certainty that he is correct and the defendant’s claim is only speculative, the definite claim still does not render the defendant liable to pay, absent proof.
<b>Alternatively,</b> the phrase: This is the significant principle of monetary law, was necessary <b>for</b> instances <b>such as this, as it was stated:</b> In the case of <b>one who sells an ox to another and</b> the ox <b>is found</b> to be one that <b>habitually gores, Rav says</b> that <b>this is</b> considered to be <b>a mistaken transaction,</b> since the purchaser can claim that he bought the ox specifically for labor, and an ox that gores is not suitable for such tasks. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> The seller can <b>say to him: I sold it to you for slaughter,</b> and the fact that it gores is immaterial.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> are Rav and Shmuel speculating about the purpose of the sale? <b>But let us</b> simply <b>see if</b> the purchaser is <b>a person who buys</b> oxen <b>for plowing or a person who buys</b> oxen <b>for slaughter.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for them to engage in a dispute in the case <b>of a person who buys</b> oxen <b>for</b> both <b>this and for that</b> reason, and in this instance it was unclear for which purpose it was intended.
The Gemara asks: <b>But let us see</b> what the purchase price was: <b>If</b> he paid <b>the price of</b> an ox fit for <b>plowing,</b> which is a large amount of money, then it can be assumed it was intended <b>for plowing.</b> But <b>if</b> he paid the <b>price of</b> an ox for <b>slaughtering,</b> which is a much smaller amount, it can be assumed that it was sold <b>for slaughtering.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for them to engage in a dispute in a case <b>where</b> the cost of <b>meat rose and</b> an ox purchased for slaughtering <b>stands at the</b> same <b>price</b> as an ox purchased <b>for plowing.</b> In that case, Rav and Shmuel dispute whether the purchaser can claim that the transaction was made in error, or whether the seller can claim that he sold it to be slaughtered and the purchaser must provide proof for his claim.
The Sages <b>said:</b>

Daf 46b

<b>But if</b> the loss to the purchaser <b>cannot be reimbursed from</b> the purchasing money by returning it, e.g., if the seller spent it already, <b>let</b> the purchaser <b>take the ox</b> itself <b>in lieu of the money, as people say:</b> Allow yourself to be <b>repaid by your debtors</b> even in <b>bran,</b> since anything may be used as payment for a debt. In the event that the seller has no money with which to reimburse the purchaser, even if it is a mistaken transaction the result may be that the purchaser keeps the ox in lieu of having his money returned. Accordingly, there would be no practical difference between the opinions of Rav and Shmuel.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for them to engage in a dispute in a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>does have</b> sufficient funds <b>from</b> which <b>to repay</b> the purchaser, and the purchaser demands that his money be returned as opposed to keeping the ox as payment.
The Gemara now explains the logic of Rav and Shmuel: <b>Rav says</b> that <b>this is</b> a case of <b>a mistaken transaction,</b> due to the principle: <b>Follow the majority, and the majority of people buy oxen for plowing. And Shmuel says</b> that the seller <b>can say to him: I sold it to you for slaughtering, and we do not follow the majority</b> in this case. <b>When do we follow the majority</b> according to Shmuel? Only <b>in</b> determining the <b>prohibited</b> or permitted status of an item. <b>But in monetary matters</b> such as this, <b>we do not follow the majority. Rather,</b> the operative principle is that <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b>
<b>That</b> which Rav Yehuda stated above, that the mishna follows the opinion of Sumakhos, <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>an ox that gores a cow, and its fetus is found</b> dead <b>at its side, and he does not know whether it gave birth before</b> the ox <b>gored it or it gave birth after</b> the ox <b>gored it,</b> the owner of the ox <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage for the cow and one-quarter</b> of the cost of <b>the damage for the offspring;</b> this is <b>the statement of Sumakhos. The Rabbis say: The burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the burden of proof rests upon the claimant? As it is stated</b> in the Torah when Moses appointed Aaron and Hur to judge the people: <b>“Whoever has a cause, let him come near [<i>yiggash</i>] to them”</b> (Exodus 24:14). This is interpreted to mean that whoever has a claim against another <b>should submit [<i>yaggish</i>] proof to them.</b> According to this interpretation, this verse demonstrates clearly that the claimant is responsible for supplying the proof.
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this: Why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to derive this? It <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning that one who suffers from pain goes to the doctor.</b> Just as here the individual with the problem has the responsibility to resolve it, so too, someone with a claim against another must bring a proof to corroborate his claim.
<b>Rather, the verse</b> is needed <b>for that which Rav Naḥman</b> says that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says, as Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> a court <b>first attends only to</b> the arguments of <b>the claimant</b> and only afterward attends to the counterclaims of the defendant and discusses them? <b>As it is stated: “Whoever has a cause, let him come near [<i>yiggash</i>] to them,”</b> which is interpreted to mean that whoever has a claim against another <b>should submit [<i>yaggish</i>] his claim to them</b> first before the defendant.
The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say</b> that despite this principle, <b>sometimes</b> a court <b>attends to the defendant first</b> and listens to his defense before discussing the arguments of the claimant. <b>What are the circumstances</b> where this occurs? This occurs in a case <b>where his assets are depreciating</b> because of the claim against him. In that situation, the court allows him to present his arguments first so that he can sell his assets at their true price.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And likewise,</b> in the case of <b>a cow that gored an ox,</b> and the cow’s newborn offspring was subsequently found at its side, half the cost of the damage is paid from the cow and one-quarter of the cost of the damage is paid from the offspring. The Gemara asks: The mishna’s wording indicates that the owner of the cow pays <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage and</b> an additional <b>one-quarter of</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> thereby amounting to three-quarters of the cost of the damage. This is difficult to understand, as <b>he is required to pay</b> only <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> since the ox is innocuous. If the mishna states that he pays <b>three-quarters of</b> the cost of <b>the damage, what is its purpose?</b>
<b>Abaye said:</b> The phrase: <b>Half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> actually means <b>one-fourth</b> of the cost <b>of the damage.</b> Since there are two animals that may have accomplices in the incident, the owner of the cow pays only half of the normal amount from the value of the cow, i.e., one-quarter of the cost of the damage. The other half of the payment, which is <b>one-quarter of</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> should be paid from the value of the newborn, who is the accomplice of the cow. Yet, due to the uncertainty of whether it was born before the goring or afterward, only half of that amount is paid from it, which is <b>one-eighth of the</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b> Therefore, the owner of the ox receives a total of three-eighths of the cost of the damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>But if the cow and the offspring are</b> owned <b>by one</b> person, the injured party <b>can indeed say to the owner of the cow: Whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, <b>give me half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> either from the value of the cow or the newborn, which both belong to you. Why is it necessary to give half of the payment specifically from the cow and half from the newborn? <b>Rather,</b> this ruling of the mishna <b>is not necessary</b> except for the case <b>where the cow</b> belongs <b>to one</b> person <b>and the offspring to another,</b> and so each can claim that he is only partially responsible for the damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even in this case, <b>if</b> the injured party <b>came forward</b> and <b>claimed</b> payment from <b>the owner of the cow first, he can indeed say to the owner of the cow: Your cow</b> certainly <b>caused damage</b> to <b>my</b> property, so <b>bring me a proof that you have a partner.</b> The owner of the cow would then have to prove that the newborn calf was still a fetus at the time and therefore a partner in the incident, in order to exempt himself from paying the entire payment of half the cost of the damage.
<b>Rather,</b> the case of the mishna is one <b>where he claimed</b> payment from <b>the owner of the offspring first, as</b> in this case the owner of the cow <b>can say to him:</b> Since you claimed payment from the owner of the newborn, <b>you</b> thereby <b>disclosed your opinion</b> on the matter, <b>that I have a partner</b> who is responsible for part of the damage. Therefore, I am not prepared to pay the full amount required, i.e., half the cost of the damage, but only half of that amount, i.e., one-quarter.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say: Even though</b> the injured party came forward and <b>claimed</b> payment from <b>the owner of the cow first,</b> the latter <b>can dismiss his</b> claim, <b>as he can say to him: I know that I have a partner</b> in this matter, i.e., the owner of the newborn calf.
<b>Rava said,</b> in challenging Abaye’s explanation: <b>Is that to say</b> that the mishna <b>teaches: One-quarter of</b> the cost of <b>the damage and one-eighth of the</b> cost of the <b>damage?</b> The mishna <b>teaches half</b> the cost of <b>the damage and one-quarter of</b> the cost of <b>the damage. Rather, Rava said: Actually,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to</b> a case where the <b>cow and</b> its <b>offspring belong to one</b> person, <b>and this is what we are saying:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that with regard to damage caused by an innocuous animal, restitution is paid only from the money realized by selling the belligerent animal. Therefore, if <b>the cow is here, half</b> the cost of <b>the damage is paid from</b> the value of <b>the cow</b> itself;

Daf 47a

if <b>the cow is not</b> here, e.g., it went astray, only <b>one-quarter of</b> the cost of <b>the damage is reimbursed from the offspring.</b>
The Gemara infers: According to Rava, <b>the reason</b> for paying only one-quarter of the cost of the damage is <b>that we do not know if the offspring was with it,</b> as a fetus, <b>when</b> the cow <b>gored or whether it was not. But</b> if it <b>is obvious to us that the offspring was with it</b> as a fetus <b>when it gored, the full</b> amount of <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage may be reimbursed from the offspring</b> if the cow is not there.
The Gemara comments: In this respect, <b>Rava</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rava says:</b> In the case of <b>a cow that caused damage</b> while pregnant, the injured party <b>collects</b> compensation <b>from its offspring,</b> i.e., the offspring that had been a fetus at the time of the goring. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is because <b>it is</b> considered an integral part of <b>its body</b> and therefore may be used to collect payment. By contrast, in the case of <b>a hen that caused damage,</b> the injured party <b>does not collect</b> compensation <b>from its egg.</b> Payment can be collected only from the body of the hen. <b>What is the reason?</b> The egg <b>is simply a secretion</b> and not an integral part of the hen’s body.
§ <b>And Rava</b> also <b>says:</b> When assessing the damage inflicted by a goring ox on a cow whose newborn calf is found dead by its side, the court <b>does not appraise</b> the damage <b>to the cow by itself and</b> the damage <b>to the offspring by itself. Rather,</b> the court <b>appraises the offspring together with the cow</b> and evaluates the overall damage inflicted on the pregnant cow, which will be slightly less than it would be with two separate evaluations. The reason for this is <b>that if you do not say this, you</b> will be <b>found</b> to have ultimately <b>weakened the one liable for damage</b> by inflicting a loss on him, as the market value of a newborn calf is greater than the difference in market value between a pregnant cow and one that is not pregnant.
<b>And similarly, you find</b> this principle in a case <b>where</b> someone <b>severed the hand of another’s slave.</b> The difference in value between a slave with a hand and a slave without a hand is assessed, rather than determining how much money the owner would request in exchange for allowing the hand of his slave to be cut off. <b>And similarly, you</b> also <b>find</b> this principle in a case <b>of one who causes damage</b> to part of <b>another’s field.</b> The court appraises not the garden bed that was eaten or trampled, but the depreciation in value of the bed as part of the surrounding area. This results in a smaller payment, as the damage appears less significant in the context of a larger area.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi:</b> The main reason invoked by Rava is that otherwise you will be found to have ultimately weakened the one liable for damage. <b>But if this is the <i>halakha</i></b> of assessing the damage, then <b>let the one liable for damage be weakened</b> by losing money.
Rav Ashi answered: This is <b>because</b> the one liable for damage <b>can say to him: I caused damage</b> to <b>you</b> through injuring <b>a pregnant cow,</b> and so <b>I am assessing</b> the value of <b>a pregnant cow for you.</b> Therefore, it is not correct to evaluate separately the damage to the cow and the damage to the offspring.
The Gemara raises a question: It <b>is obvious</b> that in a case where <b>the cow</b> belonged <b>to one</b> person <b>and the offspring</b> belonged <b>to another</b> that the compensation for the cow’s loss of <b>fat</b> is paid <b>to the owner of the cow.</b> The additional value that the cow had due to the fact that it was fatter due to the pregnancy is paid to the owner of the cow. The question is: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> concerning the cow’s <b>bulk?</b> There is an increase in value of a pregnant cow that it is attributed to its improved appearance, which results from its carrying a fetus. Who is considered the injured party with regard to that sum? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This too belongs <b>to the owner of the cow,</b> whereas <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: They divide</b> the restitution. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>they divide</b> the restitution.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a potter who brought his pots into a homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and the homeowner’s animal broke</b> the pots, the homeowner is <b>exempt. If</b> the owner’s animal <b>was injured by</b> the pots, <b>the owner of the pots is liable. But if</b> the potter <b>brought</b> them <b>inside with permission, the owner of the courtyard is liable</b> if his animal caused damage to the pots.
Similarly, if someone <b>brought his produce into the homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and the homeowner’s animal ate them,</b> the homeowner is <b>exempt. If</b> his animal was <b>injured by them,</b> e.g., if it slipped on them, <b>the owner of the produce is liable. But if he brought</b> his produce <b>inside with permission, the owner of the courtyard is liable</b> for the damage caused by his animal to them.
Similarly, if one <b>brought his ox into the homeowner’s courtyard without</b>

Daf 47b

<b>permission, and the homeowner’s ox gored it or the homeowner’s dog bit it,</b> the homeowner is <b>exempt.</b> If it <b>gored the homeowner’s ox,</b> the owner of the goring ox is <b>liable.</b> Furthermore, if the ox that he brought into the courtyard without permission <b>fell into</b> the owner’s <b>pit and contaminated its water,</b> the owner of the ox is <b>liable</b> to pay compensation for despoiling the water. If the homeowner’s <b>father or son were inside</b> the pit at the time the ox fell and the person died as a result, the owner of the ox <b>pays the ransom. But if he brought</b> the ox into the courtyard <b>with permission, the owner of the courtyard is liable</b> for the damage caused.
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The homeowner <b>is not liable in any</b> of the cases in the mishna, even if he gave his permission for the items to be brought into his premises, <b>unless he</b> explicitly <b>accepts</b> responsibility <b>upon himself to safeguard</b> them.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> From the first case of the mishna, it can be inferred that <b>the reason</b> the potter is liable <b>is</b> that he brought his pots into another’s courtyard <b>without permission. But</b> if he brought them in <b>with permission, the potter would not be liable for damage</b> caused <b>to the courtyard owner’s animal; and we do not say</b> that <b>the potter accepted</b> responsibility for the <b>safeguarding of the courtyard owner’s animal</b> from his own pots.
<b>Whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is</b> that of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who says</b> at the conclusion of the mishna that <b>any case</b> where permission is granted to allow an item into one’s premises <b>without specification,</b> i.e., without an explicit agreement as to who is responsible for safeguarding the item, it is assumed that with regard to each party, he <b>has not accepted upon himself</b> the responsibility of <b>safeguarding</b> the item. Therefore, the potter who received permission to bring his pots into the owner’s courtyard similarly did not accept responsibility to safeguard against damage to the property of the owner of the courtyard.
But <b>say the latter clause: If</b> the potter <b>brought them into</b> the courtyard <b>with permission, the owner of the courtyard is liable.</b> In this case, <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who</b> disagree with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and <b>say</b> that, even <b>in</b> a case where permission is granted to allow an item into one’s premises <b>with-out specification,</b> where the owner merely said he could bring them into the courtyard, the homeowner <b>accepts upon himself</b> responsibility for <b>safeguarding</b> the items to ensure that they are not damaged, <b>as well.</b>
<b>And furthermore,</b> the end of the mishna states: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that the owner of the courtyard <b>is not liable in any</b> of the cases in the mishna, even if he gave his permission for the items to be brought into his premises, <b>unless the homeowner</b> explicitly <b>accepts</b> responsibility <b>upon himself to safeguard</b> them. Therefore, it emerges that <b>the first clause and the last clause</b> of the mishna are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>but the middle clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> Is this a reasonable way to read the mishna?
The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> This mishna is <b>disjointed</b> and doesn’t follow a single opinion. Rather, the one <b>who taught this</b> clause of the mishna <b>did not teach that</b> clause of the mishna. <b>Rava said:</b> The beginning of the mishna <b>is entirely</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> In the case <b>where</b> the potter received <b>permission</b> to place his pots there, <b>the owner of the courtyard accepted</b> responsibility <b>upon himself</b> for the <b>safeguarding of the pots, and even</b> to the extent that if the pots <b>broke due to the wind,</b> he would be liable. The owner of the pots, by contrast, did not accept any responsibility to ensure that his items would not cause damage.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>he brought his produce into the homeowner’s courtyard</b> without permission, and the owner’s animal was injured by the produce, he is liable. <b>Rav says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>slipped on it</b> and fell, <b>but</b> if <b>it ate</b> from the produce and was injured, he is <b>exempt. What is the reason?</b> The animal <b>should not have eaten</b> it, and it was not the owner of the fruit who acted improperly but the animal itself.
<b>Rav Sheshet said: I say that Rav stated this <i>halakha</i> while dozing and lying down,</b> and it is not entirely precise, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who places poison before another’s animal</b> is <b>exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven.</b> From the above statement, it may be inferred that <b>it is</b> specifically where he put <b>poison</b> before the animal that he is exempt, <b>since it is not suitable for eating. But</b> if he put <b>produce</b> before it, <b>which is suitable for eating,</b> and the animal dies from eating it, <b>he is also liable according to human laws.</b> The Gemara analyzes this ruling: <b>But why</b> is he liable? Here also Rav’s logic can be invoked, that the animal <b>should not have eaten</b> it. Therefore, this <i>baraita</i> poses a difficulty for Rav.
In order to explain Rav’s statement, the Sages <b>said: The same is true,</b> that <b>even</b> if the animal was injured by eating the produce, he would <b>also</b> be <b>exempt according to human laws, and this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us this, that even</b> in the case of <b>poison, which is not suitable for eating,</b> the one who placed the poison before the animal is <b>liable according to the laws of Heaven.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the case where the <i>baraita</i> exempts from liability according to human laws the one who placed <b>poison</b> before the animal is referring <b>to</b> an item suitable for eating <b>as well,</b> such as <b><i>afrazta</i>,</b> a type of herb that appears edible for animals but is actually poisonous. Therefore, this herb <b>is</b> halakhically equivalent to any other <b>produce</b> for which he is exempt from liability according to human laws, since, as Rav explained, the animal should not have eaten it.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a woman who entered</b> the house of <b>a homeowner without permission</b> in order <b>to grind wheat, and the homeowner’s animal ate</b> the wheat, he is <b>exempt.</b> Moreover, <b>if</b> the homeowner’s animal <b>was injured</b> by the wheat, the woman is <b>liable.</b> Now according to Rav’s explanation, <b>why</b> is she liable? <b>Let us say</b> here as well that the animal <b>should not have eaten</b> it.
In order to explain Rav’s statement, the Sages <b>said:</b> What is the difficulty here? <b>Is</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>preferable to the mishna that we interpreted</b> as a scenario <b>where</b> the animal <b>slipped on</b> the produce? Similarly, the <i>baraita</i> is also referring to a case where the animal was injured by slipping on the wheat, not by eating it.
The Gemara asks: <b>And he who asked it, why did he ask it?</b> This answer seems obvious. The Gemara answers: The questioner could have <b>said to you: Granted, the mishna</b> that teaches: <b>If</b> it is <b>injured by them [<i>bahen</i>], is</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>slipped on them [<i>bahen</i>]. But here</b> in the <i>baraita</i> it <b>teaches</b> the phrase: <b>If it is injured, and</b> it <b>does not teach</b> the additional term: <b><i>Bahen</i>.</b> Since this case is immediately preceded by the case of: And the owner’s animal ate them, it is reasonable to surmise <b>that</b> when the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> the case of the animal being injured, the injury <b>is</b> due to <b>eating.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And the other</b> one, i.e., the one who provided the answer, could have <b>said to you</b> in response: There <b>is no difference</b> whether it states: It was injured, or: It was injured by them, as in both cases the injury can be explained as resulting from slipping and not from eating.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>brought his ox into a homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and</b> the ox <b>ate wheat</b> belonging to the homeowner <b>and</b> consequently was stricken with <b>diarrhea and died,</b> then the homeowner is <b>exempt.</b> But <b>if</b> the ox’s owner <b>brought</b> it <b>into</b> the courtyard <b>with permission, the owner of the courtyard</b> is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Why,</b> in the latter case, is the owner liable for the damage to the ox? Shouldn’t the assertion: The ox <b>shouldn’t have eaten</b> it, be invoked, and any injury that follows is the responsibility of the ox’s owner?
<b>Rava said</b> in response: <b>Are you raising a contradiction</b> from a case <b>with permission</b> and applying it <b>against</b> a case <b>without permission?</b> There is no difficulty here, since <b>in</b> the case where the ox’s owner brought the ox into the courtyard <b>with permission,</b> the homeowner thereby <b>accepted</b> responsibility <b>upon himself</b> for <b>safeguarding</b> against any damage to the other’s <b>ox. And even</b> if the ox <b>strangled itself,</b> he would still be liable.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In a case <b>where</b> the owner of the courtyard <b>accepted upon himself</b> responsibility for <b>safeguarding</b> the items entering his premises, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Did he accept upon himself only</b> the responsibility <b>of</b> safeguarding <b>himself</b> and his animals from causing damage? <b>Or, perhaps he even accepted</b> responsibility <b>upon himself</b> for <b>safeguarding</b> against all forms of damage that originate <b>from the outside.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution based on <b>that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda bar Simon taught in</b> the tractate of <b><i>Nezikin</i></b> from <b>the school of Karna:</b> If one <b>brought his produce into a homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and an ox came from elsewhere and ate it,</b> he is <b>exempt. But if</b> one <b>brought</b> the produce <b>into</b> the courtyard <b>with permission,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Who</b> is the phrase: He is <b>exempt,</b> referring to, <b>and who</b> is the phrase: He is <b>liable,</b> referring to? <b>Does it not</b> mean that <b>the owner of the courtyard</b> is <b>exempt and the owner of the courtyard</b> is <b>liable?</b> This would indicate that by granting permission for the produce to be brought in, he accepts responsibility to safeguard against other damage as well, such as that caused by another ox entering from the outside.
In response, <b>they said</b> that this interpretation should be rejected: <b>No,</b> it means that <b>the owner of the ox</b> that causes damage is <b>exempt, and the owner of the ox</b> is <b>liable.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But if</b> it is referring to <b>the owner of the ox,</b>

Daf 48a

<b>what</b> reason is there to rule one way where the produce is brought in <b>with permission, and what</b> reason <b>is there</b> to rule another way where the produce is brought in <b>without permission?</b> With regard to damage done by the ox of a stranger, it should not make any difference.
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: If he brought in the produce <b>with permission, it is</b> a case of damage under the category of <b>Eating</b> (see 2a), <b>in the domain of the injured</b> party, since, with respect to the produce, the courtyard is treated as belonging to its owner, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that if an animal causes damage categorized as <b>Eating in the domain of the injured</b> party, the ox’s owner is <b>liable.</b> But if he brought it into the courtyard <b>without permission, it is</b> a case of damage under the category of <b>Eating in the public domain, and</b> if an animal causes damage categorized as <b>Eating in the public domain,</b> the ox’s owner is <b>exempt.</b> Given this explanation, the answer to the question of what type of safeguarding the courtyard owner accepted cannot be derived from the <i>baraita</i>.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from another <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>brought his ox into a homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and an ox from elsewhere comes and gores it,</b> he is <b>exempt. But if he brought</b> it <b>into</b> the courtyard <b>with permission,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>Who</b> is <b>exempt and who</b> is <b>liable? Is it not the owner of the courtyard</b> who is <b>exempt and the owner of the courtyard</b> who is <b>liable?</b> If so, this proves that the owner of the courtyard accepted responsibility for all damage occurring on his premises.
The Gemara responds: <b>No, the owner of the ox</b> that gored is <b>exempt, and the owner of the ox</b> that gored is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what</b> significance is there to specifying the case of <b>with permission, and what</b> significance <b>is there</b> to specifying the case of <b>without permission</b> with regard to this ox? For damage categorized as Goring (see 2b), the owner of the animal is liable wherever the goring occurred, even in the public domain.
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon, who says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of damage categorized as <b>Goring in the courtyard of the injured</b> party <b>is different,</b> and the owner of the goring animal <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b> According to this opinion, the <i>baraita</i> should be interpreted as follows: If the injured party brought his ox into the courtyard <b>with permission, it is</b> a case of damage categorized as <b>Goring in the property of the injured</b> party, <b>and</b> the owner of the Goring animal <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b> But if he brought it in <b>without permission, it is</b> a case of damage categorized as <b>Goring in the public domain, and he pays only half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
§ The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain woman who entered a certain house to bake.</b> Subsequently, <b>a goat</b> belonging <b>to the owner of the house came</b> and <b>ate the</b> woman’s <b>dough,</b> and as a result <b>it became overheated and died. Rava deemed</b> the woman <b>liable to pay compensation for the goat.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that Rava <b>disagrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav, as Rav says</b> that in a case where someone brings in his produce to another’s courtyard without permission, and the latter’s animal is injured by eating it, the owner of the produce is nevertheless exempt, since the animal <b>should not have eaten</b> it.
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case where someone brought in his produce <b>without permission,</b> he <b>did not accept</b> responsibility <b>upon himself</b> for <b>safeguarding</b> against the produce causing damage, whereas <b>here,</b> where the woman brought in the dough <b>with permission,</b> the woman did <b>accept</b> responsibility <b>upon herself</b> for <b>safeguarding</b> against the dough causing damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> it <b>different from</b> the case of the <i>baraita</i> mentioned previously: In the case of <b>a woman who entered</b> the house of <b>a homeowner without permission</b> in order <b>to grind wheat, and the homeowner’s animal ate</b> the wheat, he is <b>exempt? And</b> moreover, <b>if</b> the homeowner’s animal <b>was injured</b> by the wheat, the woman is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> she is liable is specifically that she entered <b>without permission, but</b> if she entered <b>with permission,</b> she would be <b>exempt.</b>
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: If she entered the house <b>to grind wheat, since she does not require any privacy, the owners of the courtyard do not need</b> to <b>absent themselves</b> from there, <b>and</b> the responsibility for <b>safeguarding</b> against damage therefore <b>rests upon them. But</b> if she enters <b>to bake, since she requires privacy</b> for this, as the process of kneading involves exposing her elbows, <b>the owners of the courtyard absent themselves</b> from there to allow her to bake. <b>Therefore,</b> the responsibility for <b>safeguarding</b> against damage to anything in the courtyard <b>rests upon her.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>brought his ox inside the homeowner’s courtyard</b> without permission and the homeowner’s ox gored it or the homeowner’s dog bit it, the homeowner is exempt. <b>Rava says:</b> If one <b>brought his ox into a homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and</b> the ox <b>dug pits, ditches, or caves in it, the owner of the ox</b> is <b>liable for the damage</b> caused by his animal <b>to the courtyard, but the owner of the courtyard is liable for</b> any <b>damage</b> caused by <b>the pit</b> if someone falls inside.
<b>Even though the Master says</b> that when the verse states: <b>“And if a man shall open a pit”</b> (Exodus 21:33), it limits the liability for the pit to a person who digs a pit, <b>but not an ox</b> that digs <b>a pit,</b> in which case the owner of the courtyard should be exempt, nevertheless, <b>here,</b> in Rava’s statement, <b>since this</b> owner of the courtyard <b>should have filled</b> the pit with earth <b>and</b> he <b>did not fill it,</b> he is considered <b>like someone who</b> actually <b>dug</b> the pit.
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rava says:</b> In the case of one who <b>brought his ox into a homeowner’s courtyard without permission, and</b> the ox <b>injured the homeowner, or the homeowner</b> stumbled and <b>was injured by it,</b> the owner of the ox is <b>liable.</b> If the ox <b>crouched [<i>ravatz</i>],</b> and by doing so caused damage, the ox’s owner is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is he <b>exempt because</b> the animal caused damage when it <b>crouched? Rav Pappa said: What</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>ravatz</i>?</b> It means <b>that it dropped feces [<i>hirbitz</i>]</b> on the ground, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>the clothes of the homeowner were soiled.</b> Consequently, <b>the feces constitute a pit, and we do not find</b> a case of damage categorized as <b>Pit</b> that <b>one is liable</b> for causing damage to <b>utensils.</b> Therefore, the owner of the animal is exempt.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who says: Any obstruction is</b> categorized as <b>Pit,</b> and the same <i>halakha</i> exempting the one responsible for the pit from damage to utensils applies to them as well. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who says</b> that one’s property is not categorized as Pit <b>until he renounces ownership of it, what is there to say?</b>
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: The animal’s owner usually <b>renounces ownership</b> of <b>ordinary feces,</b> and so they are categorized as Pit even according to the opinion of Rav.
<b>And Rava says:</b> In the case of a person or an animal that <b>entered the courtyard of a homeowner without permission and injured the homeowner, or the homeowner was injured by</b> stumbling on the intruder, the person or owner of the animal is <b>liable.</b> Moreover, if <b>the homeowner damages</b> the person or animal, he is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said: We said</b> this <b>only when</b> the homeowner <b>did not know of his</b> presence. <b>But</b> if <b>he knew of his</b> presence, even if he entered without permission, then if the <b>homeowner injured him,</b> the homeowner is <b>liable. What is the reason?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the injured party can <b>say to</b> the owner of the courtyard: <b>Although you have the right to eject</b> me from your courtyard, <b>you do not have the right to injure me.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> Rava and Rav Pappa, who hold that one who enters without permission is liable if damage is caused, <b>follow their</b> lines of <b>reasoning, as Rava says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Pappa</b> who said it:

Daf 48b

In a case of <b>two</b> people who were both somewhere <b>with permission, or two</b> people who were both somewhere <b>without permission,</b> if <b>they injure each other</b> directly, they are both <b>liable.</b> If <b>they were injured by one another</b> through stumbling over one another, they are <b>exempt.</b> From this statement, it may be inferred that <b>the reason</b> both are liable if either damages the other is specifically <b>that</b> the <b>two of them</b> were both there <b>with permission or the two of them</b> were both there <b>without permission. But</b> if <b>one,</b> i.e., the homeowner, was there <b>with permission, and the other</b> entered <b>without permission,</b> then the one who was there <b>with permission</b> is <b>exempt</b> if he injured the other, but the one who entered <b>without permission</b> is <b>liable</b> if he injured the homeowner, in accordance with the opinion of Rava and Rav Pappa.
§ The mishna teaches: If the ox that he brought into the courtyard without permission <b>fell into</b> the owner’s <b>pit and contaminated its water,</b> the owner of the ox is <b>liable. Rava says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the ox <b>contaminated</b> the water <b>at the time of the fall. But</b> if it contaminated the water <b>after the fall,</b> e.g., the animal died there and the decomposing carcass despoiled the water, he is <b>exempt. What is the reason?</b> The <b>ox,</b> in this case, <b>is</b> considered as a <b>pit, and the water</b> has the status of <b>utensils</b> that fall into a pit, <b>and we have not found</b> a case of damage categorized as <b>Pit that renders one liable</b> for causing damage to <b>utensils.</b> Therefore, he is exempt.
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel, who says: Any obstruction is</b> categorized as <b>Pit,</b> and the same <i>halakha</i> exempting the one responsible for the pit from damage to utensils applies to them as well. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who says</b> that one’s property is not categorized as Pit <b>until he renounces ownership of it, what is there to say?</b> Presumably, the owner did not renounce ownership of the ox or even of the carcass.
<b>Rather, if</b> this statement <b>was stated, it was stated like this: Rava says</b> that <b>they taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in the case <b>where</b> the ox <b>contaminated</b> the water <b>with its body,</b> i.e., its carcass. <b>But</b> if it <b>contaminated</b> the water <b>with its stench,</b> the owner is <b>exempt. What is the reason?</b> It is because the damage <b>is</b> caused <b>merely</b> by <b>an indirect</b> action. Although the ox’s owner was initially responsible for his animal falling into the pit, the stench did not result directly from this action. It subsequently occurred on its own, <b>and</b> one is <b>not liable</b> for damage that is caused <b>merely</b> by <b>an indirect</b> action.
§ The mishna teaches: If the homeowner’s <b>father or son were inside</b> the pit at the time the ox fell and the person died as a result, the owner of the ox <b>pays the ransom.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> does he pay a ransom? <b>Isn’t</b> the ox <b>innocuous,</b> in which case its owner is not liable to pay a ransom? <b>Rav says:</b> Here <b>we are dealing with</b> an ox that is <b>forewarned for falling on people in pits.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the ox <b>is liable</b> to be put to <b>death,</b> because if it is forewarned for this behavior, it is considered to have acted intentionally. <b>Rav Yosef said</b> in response: This is a case <b>where it saw</b> some <b>grass</b> that it intended to eat on the edge of the pit, <b>and fell</b> in the pit instead. Since there was no intention to cause damage by falling, the ox is not liable to be put to death, but since it was forewarned for this behavior, its owner still pays ransom.
<b>Shmuel said:</b> This ox mentioned in the mishna is innocuous, and in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says:</b> The owner of an <b>innocuous</b> ox that caused damage pays <b>half a ransom.</b> Therefore, when the mishna states that he pays a ransom, it means that he pays half a ransom.
<b>Ulla said:</b> The mishna <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who</b> maintains that payment of a ransom is applicable even in the case of an innocuous ox, but he <b>states</b> his ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon, who says:</b> For damage categorized as <b>Goring</b> that is carried out by an innocuous ox <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, the ox’s owner <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage. So too,</b> he <b>pays a full ransom</b> despite the fact that the ox is innocuous.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to Ulla, this</b> explanation <b>is</b> consistent with <b>that which</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> If <b>his father or his son were inside</b> the pit at the time the ox fell and the person died as a result, the owner of the ox pays the ransom. The mishna thereby provides a case of damage categorized as Goring in the courtyard of the injured party. <b>But according to Shmuel’s</b> explanation, <b>why</b> mention <b>his father or his son specifically? Even</b> if the injured party were <b>another</b> person, not a close relative of the owner of the property, the owner of the animal would be required to pay half a ransom, and even if it was in the public domain.
The Gemara answers: Indeed, that is the case, and the mishna <b>is</b> simply <b>teaching</b> this ruling by means of <b>the typical scenario,</b> that presumably it was someone from the family of the one who owns the property containing the pit that was inside the pit.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But if he brought</b> the ox into the courtyard <b>with permission, the owner of the courtyard is liable</b> for the damage caused. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: The homeowner is not liable in any of the cases in the mishna, even if he gave his permission for the items to be brought onto his premises, unless he explicitly accepts responsibility upon himself to safeguard them. It <b>was stated</b> that the Sages disagreed with regard to the <i>halakha</i> in this dispute: <b>Rav said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>, and Shmuel said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>The Sages taught</b> a case similar to that of the mishna: If the owner of the courtyard said to the owner of the ox: <b>Bring your ox into</b> my courtyard <b>and safeguard it,</b> then if the ox <b>caused damage</b> to the property of the owner of the courtyard, the animal’s owner is <b>liable.</b> And if the ox <b>was injured,</b> the owner of the courtyard is <b>exempt.</b> If he said to him: <b>Bring your ox in and I will safeguard it,</b> then if the ox <b>was injured,</b> the owner of the courtyard is <b>liable;</b> if the ox <b>caused damage,</b> its owner is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> matter <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult: You said</b> in the first clause that if the courtyard’s owner said to him: <b>Bring your ox into</b> my courtyard <b>and safeguard it,</b> then if the ox <b>caused damage,</b> its owner is <b>liable.</b> And if it <b>was injured,</b> the owner of the courtyard is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason that the owner of the ox</b> is <b>liable and the owner of the courtyard</b> is <b>exempt</b> is specifically <b>that</b> the owner of the courtyard <b>said to</b> the owner of the ox: <b>Safeguard it.</b> One can infer that if he granted permission for the ox to enter <b>without specifying</b> that the owner of the animal safeguard it, <b>the owner of the courtyard</b> is <b>liable</b> if the ox was injured, <b>and the owner of the ox</b> is <b>exempt</b> if it caused damage. The reason the owner of the courtyard is liable is that the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> holds <b>that in an unspecified</b> case, where the obligation to safeguard the animal was not mentioned, the owner of the courtyard implicitly <b>accepts upon himself</b> responsibility for <b>safeguarding</b> the ox.
The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Say the latter clause:</b> If he said to him: <b>Bring your ox in and I will safeguard it,</b> then if the ox <b>was injured,</b> the owner of the courtyard is <b>liable;</b> if the ox <b>caused damage,</b> its owner is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason that the owner of the courtyard</b> is <b>liable and the owner of the ox</b> is <b>exempt</b> is specifically <b>that</b> the homeowner <b>said to</b> the owner of the ox: <b>And I will safeguard it.</b> One can infer that if the owner of the courtyard granted permission for the ox to enter <b>without specifying</b> that the owner of the animal safeguard it, <b>the owner of the ox</b> is <b>liable</b> if it damages the property of the owner of the courtyard, <b>and the owner of the courtyard</b> is <b>exempt</b> if the ox is damaged. The reason the owner of the courtyard is not liable is that the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> holds <b>that in an unspecified</b> case, where the obligation to safeguard the animal was not mentioned, the owner of the courtyard <b>does not accept upon himself</b> responsibility for <b>safeguarding</b> the ox.
The Gemara concludes its analysis: <b>We come to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>who says</b> that <b>unless the homeowner</b> explicitly <b>accepts upon himself</b> responsibility for <b>safeguarding,</b> he is not liable. Based on this understanding, the <b>first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and the latter clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> Indeed, the <i>baraita</i> is <b>disjointed,</b> and the one <b>who taught this</b> clause <b>did not teach that</b> clause. <b>Rava said: The entire</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and no inference should be drawn from the extra words: And I will safeguard it, in the latter clause. <b>Since the first clause mentions</b> that the owner of the courtyard instructed: <b>Safeguard it, the latter clause also teaches</b> that he said: <b>And I will safeguard it,</b> to maintain symmetry. The same <i>halakha</i> applies even when granting permission to enter without specification, since, according to the Rabbis, granting permission to enter includes an implicit acceptance of responsibility for safeguarding.
<b>Rav Pappa said: The entire</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds that if no specification was made, the owner of the courtyard does not accept responsibility, as inferred from the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>And</b> as for the inference drawn from the first clause, <b>he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon, who says:</b> For damage categorized as <b>Goring</b> that is carried out by an innocuous ox <b>in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, the ox’s owner <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
<b>Therefore,</b> if the owner of the courtyard <b>said to</b> the owner of the ox: <b>Safeguard it,</b> he is clearly <b>not transferring</b> the rights to any <b>portion of the courtyard to him,</b> as evident from the fact that the owner of the ox must safeguard it and may not treat the courtyard as if it were his own. Consequently, if the ox gored, <b>it is</b> a case of damage categorized as <b>Goring in the courtyard of the injured</b> party, <b>and</b> one responsible for damage categorized as <b>Goring in the courtyard of the injured</b> party <b>pays</b> the <b>full</b> cost of the <b>damage.</b>
By contrast, if the owner of the courtyard <b>did not say to</b> the owner of the ox: <b>Safeguard it,</b> then by granting him permission to bring the ox onto his courtyard, he effectively <b>transfers</b> rights to <b>an area within the courtyard.</b> Therefore, with regard to damages, it becomes <b>a courtyard of partners, and</b> the one responsible for damage categorized as <b>Goring in the courtyard of partners pays only half</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>an ox that was intending to</b> gore <b>another</b> ox <b>but struck</b> a pregnant <b>woman, and her offspring,</b> i.e., the fetuses, <b>emerged</b> due to miscarriage, the owner of the ox is <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring. But</b> in the case of <b>a person who was intending to</b> injure <b>another but struck</b> a pregnant <b>woman</b> instead, <b>and her offspring emerged</b> due to miscarriage, <b>he pays compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring.</b>
<b>How does he pay compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring,</b> i.e., how is their value assessed? The court <b>appraises</b> the value of <b>the woman</b> by calculating <b>how much she</b> would be <b>worth</b> if sold as a maidservant <b>before giving birth, and how much she</b> would be <b>worth after giving birth.</b> He then pays the difference in value to the woman’s husband. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said:</b>

Daf 49a

<b>If so,</b> the consequences would be absurd, as <b>when a woman gives birth</b> her value <b>increases. Rather,</b> the court <b>appraises how much the offspring are worth, and</b> the one liable for the damage <b>gives</b> that amount <b>to the husband. And if she does not have a husband,</b> e.g., her husband died, he <b>gives</b> the money <b>to his heirs.</b>
If the pregnant woman <b>was</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant and</b> then <b>she was emancipated, or a convert,</b> and she was married to an emancipated Canaanite slave or to a convert who died without any heirs, the one who caused the damage is <b>exempt</b> from pay-ing compensation for miscarried offspring. This is because this payment is made specifically to the husband, not to the woman.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The first clause of the mishna indicates that <b>the reason</b> the owner is exempt from paying compensation for the offspring when an ox unintentionally gores a pregnant woman is specifically <b>that it was intending to</b> gore <b>another</b> ox. By inference, if it <b>was intending to</b> gore <b>the woman,</b> the owner <b>pays compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring. Shall we say</b> that this <b>should be a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Adda bar Ahava, as Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> With regard to <b>oxen that intended to</b> gore <b>a woman</b> and then did so, the owners are <b>exempt</b> from paying <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring?</b>
The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava</b> could have <b>said to you: The same is true, that even</b> if the oxen <b>intended to</b> gore <b>the woman,</b> the owners are <b>also exempt from</b> paying <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring.</b> As for <b>that which is taught</b> in the mishna: <b>An ox that was intending to</b> gore <b>another</b> ox, it <b>is</b> taught this way <b>since it wants to teach the latter clause: A person that was intending to</b> injure <b>another</b> person, <b>as this</b> case is <b>written</b> explicitly in <b>the verse:</b> “And if men struggle and hurt a pregnant woman and her offspring emerge” (Exodus 21:22). In the case in the verse, the assailant intended to injure another person but injured the woman instead. Therefore, the mishna <b>also teaches the first clause</b> in that style: <b>An ox that was intending to</b> gore <b>another</b> ox.
<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> In the case of <b>an ox that gored</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant, and her offspring emerged</b> due to miscarriage, the owner <b>pays compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring. What is the reason?</b> The ox <b>injured a mere pregnant donkey.</b> With regard to the matter of compensation for offspring, who would be the property of the master were they to be born, a Canaanite slave is considered property of the master. <b>As</b> the <b>verse states</b> that Abraham addressed Eliezer, who was a Canaanite, by saying: <b>“You remain here with [<i>im</i>] the donkey”</b> (Genesis 22:5), on which the Sages expound that he was alluding to the idea that Eliezer is of <b>a people [<i>am</i>] that is similar to a donkey.</b> Therefore, the case of an ox goring a Canaanite maidservant is not included in the Torah’s exemption from paying compensation for miscarried offspring.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>How does he pay compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring?</b> The court appraises how much the value of the woman increased due to the offspring. The Gemara asks: Would this be a correct interpretation of the term: <b>Compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring?</b> If this is how the sum is calculated, the mishna <b>should have</b> stated: How does he pay <b>the increase</b> in value due to <b>the offspring?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That is also what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: How does he pay compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring and the increase</b> in value due to <b>the offspring?</b> In other words, apart from evaluating the compensation for the miscarried offspring, the court also <b>appraises</b> the value <b>of the woman</b> by calculating <b> how much she</b> would be <b>worth</b> if sold as a maidservant<b> before giving birth, and how much she</b> would be <b>worth after giving birth.</b>
he mishna teaches: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: If so,</b> the consequences would be absurd, as <b>when a woman gives birth</b> her value <b>increases.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <b>saying? Rabba said: This is</b> what he <b>is saying: But is</b> the monetary value of <b>a woman higher before she gives birth than after she gives birth? But isn’t</b> the opposite true, that the monetary value of <b>a woman</b> is <b>higher after giving birth than before giving birth,</b> since the concern for her dying during childbirth, which lowers her monetary value prior to giving birth, is no longer a concern? <b>Rather,</b> the court <b>appraises</b> the value of <b>the fetuses and gives</b> that amount <b>to the husband.</b>
<b>This</b> explanation of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s statement <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>But is</b> the monetary value of <b>a woman higher before she gives birth than after she gives birth? But isn’t</b> the opposite true, that the monetary value of <b>a woman</b> is <b>higher after giving birth than before giving birth? Rather,</b> the court <b>appraises</b> the value of <b>the fetuses and gives</b> that amount <b>to the husband.</b>
<b>Rava said: This is what</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <b>is teaching: But is</b> the value of <b>the woman higher</b> only <b>for the one for whom she gives birth,</b> i.e., her husband, <b>and she herself does not have any increase</b> in value <b>at all</b> due to the <b>offspring?</b> A pregnant woman’s monetary value is increased on account of her pregnancy, beyond the monetary value of the offspring. <b>Rather,</b> the court <b>appraises</b> the value of <b>the offspring and gives</b> it <b>to the husband. And</b> in addition, <b>the</b> husband and wife <b>divide the increase</b> in her value due to the <b>offspring.</b>
<b>This</b> explanation of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: But is</b> the value of <b>the woman higher</b> only <b>for the one for whom she gives birth,</b> i.e., her husband, <b>and she herself does not have any increase</b> in value <b>at all</b> due to the <b>offspring? Rather,</b> the court <b>appraises damage by itself and pain by itself, and appraises</b> the value of <b>the offspring and gives</b> it <b>to the husband, and the</b> husband and wife <b>divide the increase</b> in her value due to the <b>offspring.</b>
The Gemara asks: The opinion <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, that the woman’s value decreases because of pregnancy, poses <b>a difficulty for that of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, that it increases.
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> since each <i>baraita</i> is referring to a different case: <b>Here,</b> the first <i>baraita</i>, which stated that the woman’s value increases after giving birth, is referring <b>to</b> a woman <b>giving birth to</b> her <b>firstborn.</b> Her value decreases prior to birth out of concern that she might die in childbirth. <b>There,</b> the second <i>baraita</i>, which stated that her value increases due to pregnancy, is referring <b>to</b> a woman <b>who is not giving birth to</b> her <b>firstborn.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> of <b>the Rabbis</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>who say: The increase</b> in her value due to <b>the offspring</b> is <b>also</b> given <b>to the husband?</b> The Gemara answers: They derive it from a redundancy in a verse, <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And hurt a pregnant woman and her offspring emerge” (Exodus 21:22). <b>From the fact that it is stated: “And her offspring emerge,” don’t I know</b> by inference <b>that she was pregnant?</b> If so, <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “A pregnant</b> woman,” and not just “a woman”? <b>To inform you</b> that even the <b>increase</b> in her value due to <b>the pregnancy</b> is given <b>to the husband.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>does Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel expound on this</b> extra word <b>“pregnant”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says</b> that one who injures a woman <b>is never liable</b> to pay compensation for miscarried offspring <b>unless he strikes her opposite the womb,</b> i.e., on the abdomen. <b>Rav Pappa said: Do not say</b> that it must be <b>literally opposite the womb. Rather,</b> he is liable if she was struck <b>anywhere that the wound’s</b> impact could <b>reach the offspring,</b> i.e., any part of the torso, <b>to exclude</b> a wound to her <b>hand or foot, for which</b> he is <b>not</b> liable, since it could be argued that it was not the wound to the hand or foot that caused the miscarriage.
§ The mishna teaches: If the pregnant woman <b>was a maidservant and</b> then <b>she was emancipated, or a convert,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from the payment of damages for miscarried offspring. <b>Rabba says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where one injured her during the lifetime of the convert,</b> i.e., her husband, <b>and the convert died</b> before the payment was given. The reason for this is <b>that since</b> the assailant <b>injured her during the lifetime of the convert, the convert acquires</b> the money, although it is still in the possession of the one liable for the damage. <b>And once the convert dies</b> without heirs, the money is ownerless. Therefore, the assailant <b>acquires it from the convert.</b> Since anyone can assume ownership of ownerless property, the assailant, who already possesses the money, becomes the owner. <b>But if he injured her after the convert had died, she acquires</b> the money, <b>and he must pay the woman herself.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> in amazement: <b>Master of this ruling! Is that to say</b> that compensation for the <b>offspring is</b> like <b>bundles</b> of money, <b>and she acquires them</b> when her husband dies? Rabba seems to understand that the pregnant woman assumes ownership of the offspring by virtue of being in possession of them when the husband dies, and therefore has the right to compensation for them. That is not the case. <b>Rather,</b> if <b>the husband is present, the Merciful One grants</b> compensation for the offspring <b>to him,</b> but if <b>the husband is not</b> alive, the Torah does <b>not</b> grant compensation to anyone else.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against the opinion of Rabba from the following: If the assailant <b>struck the woman and her offspring emerged</b> due to miscarriage, <b>he gives</b> compensation for <b>damage and pain to the woman and compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring to the husband.</b> If <b>the husband is not</b> alive, <b>he gives</b> the compensation for the offspring <b>to his heirs.</b> If <b>the woman is not</b> alive, <b>he gives</b> the payment owed to her <b>to her heirs.</b> If <b>she was a maidservant and</b> then <b>she was emancipated, or a convert,</b> the assailant <b>acquires</b> the money. This indicates that if the husband is no longer alive, the woman doesn’t receive anything.
The Sages <b>said</b> in response to this: <b>But is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>preferable to the mishna, which we interpreted</b> as a referring to case <b>where he injured her during the lifetime of the convert, and the convert</b> then <b>died? Here also,</b> it must be explained <b>that he injured her during the lifetime of the convert, and the convert</b> then <b>died. And if you wish, say</b> instead that he injured her even <b>after the death of the convert.</b>

Daf 49b

<b>And</b> as for the expression in the <i>baraita</i>: He acquires, referring to the one who causes the damage, <b>teach: She acquires.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the dispute between Rabba and Rav Ḥisda <b>is parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> With regard to <b>a Jewish woman who was married to a convert, and she became pregnant from him, and</b> someone <b>injured her,</b> causing her to miscarry: If this was <b>during the lifetime of the convert,</b> the assailant <b>gives compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring to the convert,</b> i.e., her husband. If this was <b>after the death of the convert,</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that the assailant is <b>liable, and</b> it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that the assailant is <b>exempt. What, is it not</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba,</b> it <b>is certainly</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> His opinion does not accord with the second <i>baraita</i>. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda, shall we say</b> that it <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b>
This is not necessarily so, as Rav Ḥisda could say that both <i>baraitot</i> are in accordance with his opinion. As for the difference between them, that is <b>not difficult.</b> They can be explained as referring to the increase in the woman’s value due to the offspring, which is subject to dispute in the mishna, rather than referring to the payment of compensation for miscarried offspring. <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which taught that he is exempt, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who maintain that the increase in her value on account of the offspring belongs to the husband. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i>, which taught that he is liable, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> who maintains that the woman has a share in her increase in value due to pregnancy, and this is paid even if the incident occurred after the husband’s death.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, why</b> state <b>specifically</b> that it occurs <b>after the death</b> of the husband? <b>Even during</b> the husband’s <b>lifetime, she also has a half</b> share, as explained earlier in the discussion. The Gemara answers: <b>While</b> he is <b>alive, she has a half</b> share, but <b>after</b> his <b>death, all of it</b> belongs to her.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> but they refer to different payments. <b>Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that taught that he is liable, is referring <b>to the increase</b> in her value due to the <b>offspring,</b> which belongs partly to the woman, and if the husband dies, she acquires the rights to all of it. By contrast, <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that taught that he is exempt, is referring <b>to compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring,</b> which belongs exclusively to her husband. Since he is a convert, the one liable for damage is exempt after his death.
The Sages <b>said,</b> in questioning this answer: Why is there a difference between the two cases? <b>From</b> the <i>halakha</i> that after the husband’s death the woman acquires his share of the <b>increase</b> in her value due to <b>the offspring, let</b> it be <b>derived</b> that according to the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel she also acquires the rights to the <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring</b> if she was wounded after his death. Moreover, <b>from</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, let</b> us <b>derive</b> that this is also the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> since there is no dispute between them with regard to the payment of compensation for miscarried offspring.
In response, the Sages <b>said: No,</b> the first assumption is untenable, since with regard to the <b>increase</b> in her value due to <b>the offspring, in which she has a share</b> from the outset, <b>she acquires all of it</b> after her husband’s death. By contrast, with regard to the <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring, in which she does not have a share</b> from the outset, <b>she does not acquire</b> the rights <b>to it at all,</b> since she has no greater claim to this than any other individual does.
§ <b>Rav Yeiva the Elder raises a dilemma to Rav Naḥman:</b> With regard to <b>one who takes possession of the documents of a convert, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> after the death of the convert? On the one hand, it can be argued that one <b>who takes possession of the document takes possession with the intention of</b> acquiring <b>the land</b> that the document states is under lien, <b>and</b> since <b>he did not take possession of the land</b> itself, <b>he also does not acquire the document.</b> This is <b>because he had no intention</b> to acquire <b>the document,</b> but just the property specified in the document. Therefore, since the convert has died, perhaps the lien is canceled and can no longer be collected, <b>or perhaps his intention is also to</b> acquire <b>the document,</b> and the paper on which it is written belongs to him.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Answer</b> this, <b>my Master: Does he need</b> to acquire the document to use as paper <b>to cover the opening of his flask?</b> Why would he want the document if it does not grant him ownership of the land described therein? Rav Yeiva the Elder <b>said to him:</b> Indeed, his intention is even <b>to cover</b> the flask <b>and to cover</b> it with the paper, albeit a mundane purpose.
<b>Rabba says:</b> In a case where the <b>collateral of a Jew</b> was <b>in the possession of a convert</b> who lent him money, <b>and the convert died, and another Jew came and took possession of it,</b> then, since the convert has no heirs, the court <b>appropriates it from his possession</b> and returns it to its owner. <b>What is the reason? Since the convert died, his lien</b> on the property <b>is abrogated.</b> Therefore, the deposit automatically returns to its owner, and no one else has the right to take it.
By contrast, if the <b>collateral of a convert</b> is <b>in the possession of a Jew</b> who lent him money <b>and the convert died, and another Jew came and took possession of it, this</b> one, i.e., the one owed money, <b>acquires</b> a share of the collateral <b>corresponding to the money</b> owed <b>to him</b> by the convert, <b>and that</b> one, i.e., the one who took possession of it, <b>acquires the rest.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> doesn’t the creditor acquire the entire collateral? If it is in his possession, <b>let his courtyard effect acquisition for him, as doesn’t Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina say: A person’s courtyard effects acquisition for him</b> even <b>without his knowledge?</b>
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the creditor <b>is not</b> standing next to the courtyard. <b>Anywhere that he is</b> present, next to the collateral, <b>so</b> that <b>if he wants to acquire</b> it <b>he could</b> pick it up and <b>acquire</b> it himself, <b>his courtyard also effects acquisition for him.</b> But <b>anywhere that he is not</b> present, next to the collateral, <b>so that if he wants to acquire</b> it <b>he could not acquire</b> it, <b>his courtyard also does not effect acquisition</b> for him.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>that</b> where the creditor <b>is not</b> present <b>in his courtyard, he does not acquire</b> the rest of the collateral.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who digs</b> part of <b>a pit on private property and opens its</b> entrance <b>in the public domain, or</b> digs a pit <b>in the public domain and opens its</b> entrance <b>on private property,</b> or digs a pit <b>on private property and opens its</b> entrance <b>on another</b> person’s <b>private property,</b> is <b>liable</b> for damage caused by the pit in each case.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who digs a pit on private property and opens its</b> entrance <b>in the public domain, or</b> who digs a pit <b>in the public domain and opens its</b> entrance <b>on private property</b> is <b>liable, and this is</b> the case of <b>Pit that is stated in the Torah;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> With regard to one who <b>renounced ownership of his property but did not renounce ownership of his pit</b> located in the property, <b>this is</b> the case of <b>Pit that is stated in the Torah.</b>
In explanation of this dispute, <b>Rabba says: With regard to a pit</b> that a person digs or opens <b>into the public domain, everyone agrees that he is liable</b> for damage that occurs as a result. <b>What is the reason? The verse states:</b> “And <b>if</b> a man <b>shall open</b> a pit,” <b>and</b> it also states: <b>“If</b> a man <b>shall dig</b> a pit” (Exodus 21:33), which raises the question: <b>If</b> one is <b>liable for opening</b> a pit by removing the cover of a pit that has already been dug, then is it <b>not all the more so</b> obvious that he should be liable <b>for digging</b> a new pit? What, then, does the latter phrase add? <b>Rather,</b> the interpretation of the verse must be that the responsibility for the pit <b>comes to him by engaging in opening</b> the pit <b>and by engaging in digging</b> the pit. Although he does not own the area itself, he is liable for creating a public hazard. <b>They disagree only</b>

Daf 50a

in the case <b>where</b> one dug <b>the pit on his</b> own <b>property</b> and then renounced ownership of the surrounding area. Consequently, the entire area except for the pit is now open to public passage. In this case, <b>Rabbi Akiva maintains</b> that one who digs <b>a pit on his</b> own <b>property</b> is <b>also liable,</b> not only when the pit is located in the public domain, <b>as it is written: “The owner of the pit</b> shall pay” (Exodus 21:34). Clearly, <b>the Merciful One is referring to a pit that has an owner.</b> Therefore, the owner of the pit pays even if it is located on private property.
<b>And Rabbi Yishmael maintains</b> that “the owner of the pit” means that <b>the one responsible for the hazard</b> is liable even if he dug the pit in the public domain and then renounced ownership of it. But one who digs a pit on his own property is not liable.
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather,</b> according to Rabba’s explanation, <b>what</b> is meant by the clause: <b>This is</b> the case of <b>Pit that is stated in the Torah,</b> in reference to digging a pit on one’s property, <b>that Rabbi Akiva states?</b> According to him, one is liable for damage in all cases, including digging in the public domain. The Gemara answers: It means that <b>this is the pit</b> with <b>which the verse initially introduces</b> the subject <b>of compensation</b> for damage caused. In that context, the Torah states: “The owner of the pit shall pay” (Exodus 21:34), indicating that even a pit owned on one’s private property renders one liable.
<b>And Rav Yosef said</b> that one can explain the dispute between Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva differently: <b>With regard to</b> one who dug <b>a pit on</b> his <b>private property</b> and then renounced ownership of the property aside from the pit, <b>everyone agrees that he is liable. What is the reason?</b> Since <b>the Merciful One states: “The owner of the pit,”</b> it indicates that <b>we are dealing with a pit that has an owner.</b>
<b>When they disagree,</b> it is in a case <b>where the pit</b> was dug <b>in the public domain. Rabbi Yishmael maintains</b> that one is <b>also liable</b> for <b>a pit</b> dug <b>in the public domain, as it is written:</b> “And <b>if</b> a man <b>shall open</b> a pit,” and: <b>“If</b> a man <b>shall dig</b> a pit” (Exodus 21:33), which raises the question: <b>If</b> he is <b>liable for opening</b> a pit by removing the cover of a pit that has already been dug, then is it <b>not all the more so</b> obvious that he should be liable <b>for digging</b> a new pit? <b>Rather,</b> the verse means that the responsibility for the pit <b>comes to him by engaging in opening</b> the pit <b>and by engaging in digging</b> the pit. Although he does not own the area itself, he is liable for creating a public hazard.
<b>And Rabbi Akiva,</b> by contrast, holds that one is liable only in the case of a pit located on private property, where he renounced ownership of the property aside from the pit, and one cannot derive otherwise from any extraneous phrases. This is because <b>these</b> phrases <b>are necessary, for if the Merciful One wrote</b> only: <b>“If</b> a man <b>shall open</b> a pit” (Exodus 21:33), <b>I would say</b> that <b>it is</b> specifically when <b>one opens</b> the covering of a pit that has already been dug <b>that it is sufficient for him to</b> place <b>a covering</b> on it to absolve himself of responsibility for damage it causes. This is the case where the Torah states: “And not cover it” (Exodus 21:33). But if one actually <b>digs</b> a pit, it <b>would not be sufficient</b> to place <b>a covering</b> on it, and one would not be exempt from damages <b>unless he</b> completely <b>packs it.</b>
<b>And</b> conversely, <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“If</b> a man <b>shall dig,” I would say</b> that <b>it is</b> specifically in a case of <b>digging that a covering is required</b> to exempt one from liability, <b>because he performed an action</b> of creating the pit. <b>But</b> for merely <b>opening</b> it, <b>where one has not performed an action, say</b> that he <b>does not require a covering</b> to absolve him of liability. Therefore, the Torah <b>teaches us</b> that he is liable for damage caused by a pit in both cases, and one should interpret the verse that states: “The owner of the pit” (Exodus 21:34), in its plain sense, i.e., that he is the owner of the pit because it is located on his private property. Accordingly, one would not be liable for a pit dug in the public domain.
The Gemara asks: <b>But rather,</b> according to Rav Yosef’s explanation, <b>what</b> is meant by the clause: <b>This is</b> the case of <b>Pit that is stated in the Torah,</b> in reference to digging a pit in the public domain, <b>that Rabbi Yishmael states?</b> Isn’t one liable for any pit, including one dug on his own property? The Gemara answers: It means that <b>this is the pit</b> with <b>which the verse initially introduces</b> the subject <b>of damage</b> caused by Pit, as explained by Rabbi Yishmael above. Only afterward does it state: “The owner of the pit shall pay,” referring to a pit dug on one’s own property.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who digs a pit</b> whose hollow space is <b>in the public domain and</b> then <b>opens its</b> entrance <b>into private property</b> is <b>exempt, and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though he does not have permission to do so.</b> The reason he does not have permission to do so is <b>that one may not create a hollow</b> space <b>under the public domain.</b>
<b>One who digs pits, ditches, and caves on private property and</b> then <b>opens their</b> entrances <b>into the public domain</b> is <b>liable.</b> In addition, one <b>who digs pits on private property that is adjacent to the public domain</b> but not actually located in the public domain itself, <b>such as these</b> people <b>who dig foundations [<i>ushin</i>]</b> for their houses or walls, is <b>exempt. But Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, deems</b> one <b>liable</b> even for damage caused by pits made to lay foundations, <b>unless he builds a partition</b> that is <b>ten</b> handbreadths high in front of the pits, <b>or unless he distances</b> them by <b>four handbreadths from the area where pedestrians walk and from the area where animals walk.</b>
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> for the exemption is that one digs <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>foundations,</b> which is the usual and accepted practice, <b>but</b> if he did <b>not</b> dig <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>foundations,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> Although he did so on his own property, he is nevertheless liable, since people walk there.
The Gemara clarifies: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>Granted, according to Rabba, the first clause,</b> where one is seemingly exempt for opening a pit onto private property even if he subsequently renounced ownership of the area, can be established in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael, and the last clause</b> can be established in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who maintains that one is liable for a pit dug on his own property if it is open to public traffic.
<b>But according to Rav Yosef’s</b> explanation, <b>granted,</b> with regard to <b>the last clause, all agree</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the first clause,</b> which exempts one who digs a pit on his own property, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this?</b> It appears to be <b>neither</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yishmael nor</b> that of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> since Rav Yosef explained that both of them maintain that one is liable for a pit on his own property, even if he subsequently renounces ownership of the area.
The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Yosef</b> could have <b>said to you: Everyone agrees</b> with the <b>entire</b> passage. As for <b>the first clause,</b> which exempts one who digs a pit under the public domain and opens it onto his own property, it is referring to a case <b>where one did not renounce ownership of either his property or his pit.</b> This certainly is not included in the category of Pit with regard to damages, and the owner is therefore exempt.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Now that you have interpreted Rav Yosef’s</b> explanation of the <i>baraita</i> as being <b>in accordance with all</b> opinions, then <b>also according to Rabba,</b> you are <b>not</b> required to <b>establish it as</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b>
Rather, one can say that <b>since the first clause</b> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who exempts one who renounces ownership of his property but not the pit, <b>the last clause</b> can <b>also</b> be explained in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael. And</b> it was previously inferred that <b>the reason</b> for the exemption when digging on one’s private property adjacent to the public domain is that one digs <b>to</b> lay <b>foundations. But</b> if it is <b>not to</b> lay <b>foundations,</b> one is <b>liable. For instance,</b> in a case <b>where one widened</b> the pit unnecessarily, extending it <b>into the public domain,</b> he has effectively dug a pit in the public domain itself.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>who digs a pit on private property and opens it into the public domain</b> is <b>liable.</b> But if he dug it <b>on private property that was adjacent to the public domain,</b> he is <b>exempt. Granted, according to Rabba,</b> this mishna is <b>entirely</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who does not hold one liable for digging on his own property. <b>But according to Rav Yosef, granted, the first clause</b> works out well in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael,</b> who holds one liable even for digging in the public domain, <b>but whose</b> opinion is <b>the latter clause?</b> It appears to be <b>neither</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yishmael nor</b> that of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b>
The Gemara answers that Rav Yosef could have <b>said to you:</b> The latter clause of this <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> one who <b>digs to</b> lay <b>foundations, and</b> therefore <b>all agree</b> with the ruling.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> If someone <b>dug or opened</b> a well <b>and transferred</b> it <b>to the public</b> for their use, he is <b>exempt</b> from damage caused by the well. If <b>he dug or opened</b> a well <b>and did not transfer</b> it <b>to the public,</b> he is <b>liable. And this</b> was <b>the practice of Neḥunya the digger of pits, ditches, and caves, who would dig, open, and transfer</b> them <b>to the public</b> so that there would be wells of water for public use. <b>When the Sages heard about the matter, they said: This</b> individual <b>has fulfilled this <i>halakha</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: Only <b>this <i>halakha</i> and no more?</b> Isn’t it well known that Neḥunya was a great man? <b>Rather, say:</b> He fulfilled <b>even this <i>halakha</i></b> and did not forget to transfer the wells to the public.
Having mentioned the deeds of Neḥunya, the Gemara relates that <b>the Sages taught: An incident</b> occurred <b>involving the daughter of Neḥunya the ditchdigger, where she fell into a large cistern</b> and no one could extricate her from it. <b>They came and informed Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa</b> so that he would pray on her behalf. When <b>the first hour</b> had passed from the time of her fall, <b>he said to them:</b> She is at <b>peace</b> and unharmed. After the <b>second</b> hour, <b>he said to them:</b> She is at <b>peace.</b> After the <b>third</b> hour, <b>he said to them: She has ascended</b> from the well, and indeed this was the case.
<b>They said to her: Who brought you up</b> out of the well? <b>She said to them: A male sheep,</b> i.e., a ram, <b>happened</b> to come <b>to me, and a certain old man,</b> i.e., Abraham, <b>was leading it,</b> and he pulled me out. <b>They said to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa: <b>Are you a prophet?</b> How did you know she had ascended? Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa <b>said to them: “I am no prophet, neither am I a prophet’s son”</b> (Amos 7:14), <b>but this</b> is what <b>I said</b> to myself: <b>Shall the offspring</b> of Neḥunya <b>stumble by means of</b> the very <b>matter which distressed that righteous man?</b>
<b>Rabbi Aḥa says:</b> Although Neḥunya ensured that others would have water, <b>even so, his son died of thirst,</b> fulfilling that which <b>is stated: “And around Him it storms [<i>nisara</i>] mightily”</b> (Psalms 50:3). This <b>teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, is scrupulous with those around Him,</b> i.e., the righteous, <b>even</b> to the extent <b>of a hairsbreadth [<i>hasa’ara</i>],</b> so that even minor transgressions elicit a severe punishment. <b>Rabbi Neḥunya says:</b> The same idea may be learned <b>from here,</b> in the following verse: <b>“A God dreaded in the great council of the holy ones, and feared by all those that surround Him”</b> (Psalms 89:8), indicating that God is most careful and exacting with those that surround Him, i.e., the righteous.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: Anyone who states</b> that <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, is forgiving [<i>vateran</i>]</b> of transgressions, <b>his life will be relinquished [<i>yivatru</i>], as it is stated: “The Rock, His work is perfect, for all His ways are justice”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:4). In other words, God does not waive heavenly justice. <b>Rabbi Ḥana says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani</b> says: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written</b>

Daf 50b

in the verse that recounts the thirteen attributes of mercy: <b>“Long-suffering [<i>erekh appayim</i>]”</b> (Exodus 34:6), using the plural form, <b>and it is not written</b> as <b><i>erekh af</i>,</b> in the singular? In order to teach that He is <b>long-suffering for</b> both <b>the righteous and for the wicked</b> and does not punish them immediately for their transgressions.
§ <b>The Sages taught: A person should not throw stones from his property into the public domain. An incident</b> occurred <b>involving a certain individual who was throwing stones from his property into the public domain, and a certain pious man found him.</b> The latter <b>said to him: Lowlife [<i>reika</i>], for what</b> reason <b>are you throwing stones from property that is not yours into your property?</b> The man <b>mocked him,</b> as he did not understand what he meant, as the property from which he was throwing stones was his.
<b>Some days</b> later, <b>he was forced to sell his field</b> from which he had thrown the stones. <b>And he was walking in the same public domain</b> into which he had thrown them, <b>and he stumbled on those same stones. He said: That pious man said</b> it <b>well to me</b> when he said: <b>For what</b> reason <b>are you throwing stones from property that is not yours into your own property,</b> since that property no longer belongs to me, and only the public domain remains mine to use.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who digs a pit in the public domain and an ox or a donkey fell into it,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is the <b>same</b> for <b>one who digs</b> either <b>a pit; a ditch,</b> which is narrow and long; <b>or a cave,</b> which is rectangular and roofed; <b>trenches and</b> water <b>channels.</b> In all these cases he is <b>liable. If so, why is</b> the verse <b>stated</b> as referring to <b>a pit,</b> as it states: “And if a man shall open a pit” (Exodus 21:33)? To teach that <b>just as a pit that has sufficient</b> depth <b>to cause death</b> when falling into it is at least <b>ten handbreadths</b> deep, <b>so too, any</b> other excavations <b>that have sufficient</b> depth <b>to cause death</b> may be no less than <b>ten handbreadths.</b> If any of the types of excavations <b>were less than ten handbreadths</b> deep, <b>and an ox or a donkey fell into</b> one of <b>them and died,</b> the digger of the excavation is <b>exempt. But if it was injured in it,</b> not killed, he is <b>liable</b> to pay damages.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav says:</b> Damage by <b>Pit for which the Torah obligates one</b> to pay is referring specifically <b>to</b> damage caused by the pit’s lethal <b>fumes,</b> i.e., suffocation, <b>but not to</b> damage caused by <b>the impact</b> of hitting the ground, for which the digger of the pit is exempt from paying compensation. The Gemara continues to explain: <b>Apparently,</b> it can be inferred that Rav <b>maintains</b> that with regard to the <b>impact</b> of hitting the bottom of the pit, <b>it is merely the ground that injures him.</b> The digger of the pit does not own the ground, so it is not a case where his property caused damage. Therefore, he does not bear responsibility for the damage.
<b>And Shmuel says:</b> The Torah renders one liable for damage caused <b>by its</b> lethal <b>fumes, and all the more so for</b> damage resulting from <b>the impact.</b> Shmuel adds: <b>And if you say</b> that the <b>Torah spoke</b> only <b>about</b> liability for <b>its impact and not for its</b> lethal <b>fumes,</b> one could respond that <b>the Torah testifies about a pit</b> without specifying for which type of pit one is liable, <b>and</b> this includes <b>even</b> a pit <b>full of woolen sponges [<i>sefogin</i>],</b> which would completely absorb the impact.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rav and Shmuel, given that falling into any pit involves injury due to both the lethal fumes and the impact? The Gemara answers: The practical difference <b>between them</b> is in the case <b>where</b> one <b>fashioned a mound</b> with a height of ten handbreadths <b>in the public domain</b> without digging, and an animal fell from this raised platform and died. <b>According to Rav,</b> the one who fashioned the mound <b>is not liable for</b> damage by Pit in the case of <b>a mound,</b> since there are no fumes, as the animal fell to the level ground. By contrast, <b>according to Shmuel, he is also liable for</b> damage by Pit in the case of <b>a mound,</b> since there is nevertheless an impact when hitting the ground.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the source for <b>the reasoning of Rav,</b> that one is not liable in that case? The Gemara answers: <b>Since the verse states: “And</b> an ox or a donkey <b>fall</b> therein” (Exodus 21:33), indicating that there is no liability for damage by Pit <b>unless</b> the animal <b>falls</b> in the <b>normal manner of falling,</b> but not where it first climbed onto an elevated surface and then fell from there to the level ground. <b>And according to Shmuel,</b> the term: <b>“And</b> an ox or a donkey <b>fall,” indicates any manner</b> of falling, regardless of whether the animal fell into a hole or fell to the ground from an elevated surface.
The Gemara challenges Rav’s opinion: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>If so, why is</b> the verse <b>stated</b> as referring to <b>a pit,</b> as it states: “And if a man shall open a pit” (Exodus 21:33)? To teach that <b>just as a pit that has sufficient</b> depth <b>to cause death</b> when falling into it is at least <b>ten handbreadths</b> deep, <b>so too, any</b> other excavations <b>that have sufficient</b> depth <b>to cause death</b> may be no less than <b>ten handbreadths.</b> Now, <b>granted</b> that according <b>to Shmuel,</b> the term: <b>So too, any</b> other, serves <b>to include</b> the case where the animal fell from <b>a height</b> of ten handbreadths, in which case the one who fashioned the mound would also be liable. <b>But according to Rav,</b> who exempts him in that case, <b>what</b> does the term: <b>So too, any</b> other, <b>add?</b>
The Gemara answers: According to Rav, it serves <b>to include trenches and</b> water <b>channels.</b> The Gemara asks: But <b>trenches and</b> water <b>channels are explicitly taught</b> in the mishna. Why does the mishna then allude to them again? The Gemara answers: It first <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> about them <b>and then explains</b> its source in the Torah.
Having mentioned these details, the Gemara asks: <b>And why do I</b> need <b>all these</b> cases <b>that are taught</b> by the mishna? The Gemara answers: They are <b>necessary, for had</b> it <b>taught</b> only the case of <b>a pit, I would say</b> that it <b>is</b> specifically <b>a pit</b> of <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>that contains</b> lethal <b>fumes, because it is constricted and round.</b> Therefore, this measurement suffices to cause death. <b>But</b> concerning <b>a ditch, which is long, say</b> that <b>in</b> a case where it is <b>ten</b> handbreadths deep, <b>there are no</b> lethal <b>fumes</b> and there is no liability. Therefore, the mishna teaches both the case of a pit and a ditch.
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>had</b> the mishna <b>taught</b> the case of <b>a ditch</b> in addition to the pit, <b>I would say</b> that it <b>is</b> specifically <b>a ditch</b> of <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>that contains</b> the necessary lethal <b>fumes, because it is narrow. But</b> concerning <b>a cave, which is rectangular</b> and not narrow, <b>say</b> that <b>in</b> a case where it is <b>ten</b> handbreadths deep, <b>there are no</b> lethal <b>fumes</b> and there is no liability. Therefore, the mishna teaches the case of a cave as well.
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>had</b> the mishna <b>taught</b> the case of <b>a cave</b> in addition to the previous two, <b>I would say</b> that it <b>is</b> specifically <b>a cave of ten</b> handbreadths <b>that contains</b> lethal <b>fumes, because it is covered. But</b> concerning <b>trenches, which are not covered, say</b> that at a depth <b>of ten</b> handbreadths, <b>there are no</b> lethal <b>fumes</b> and there is no liability. Therefore, the mishna also teaches the case of trenches.
<b>And</b> finally, <b>had</b> the mishna <b>taught</b> the case of <b>trenches</b> in addition to the previous three, <b>I would say</b> that it <b>is</b> specifically <b>trenches</b> of <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>that contain</b> lethal <b>fumes, since they are no wider at the top than at the bottom. But with regard to channels, which are wider at the top than at the bottom, say</b> that at a depth <b>of ten</b> handbreadths <b>there are no</b> lethal <b>fumes</b> and there is no liability. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> the case of channels as well, and each subsequent case listed contains a novel aspect.
The Gemara raises a further challenge from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: If any of the types of excavations <b>were less than ten handbreadths</b> deep, <b>and an ox or a donkey fell into</b> one of <b>them and died,</b> the digger of the excavation is <b>exempt. But if it was injured,</b> not killed, he is <b>liable</b> to pay damages. <b>What is the reason</b> for the ruling of: If <b>an ox or a donkey fell into it and died,</b> he is <b>exempt? Is it not because</b> at this height <b>there is not</b> sufficient <b>impact,</b> although there are lethal fumes?
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> he is exempt <b>because there are no</b> lethal <b>fumes.</b> The Gemara challenges this: <b>If that is so,</b> that a pit less than ten handbreadths deep lacks sufficient lethal fumes, why is the one who dug it <b>liable if</b> the animal <b>is injured; but there are no</b> lethal <b>fumes?</b> The Gemara <b>answers: There are not</b> sufficient <b>fumes to</b> cause <b>death, but there are</b> sufficient <b>fumes to</b> cause <b>damage.</b>
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain ox that fell into a water channel [<i>la’arita dedala’ei</i>]</b> whose depth was one cubit, i.e., six handbreadths. Because it suffered the impact of the fall, <b>its owner</b> assumed it would die and <b>slaughtered it</b> first, in order to eat the meat. <b>Rav Naḥman,</b> who was concerned that its organs were crushed by the fall, <b>deemed it an animal with a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> which it is prohibited to consume.
Furthermore, <b>Rav Naḥman said: If the owner of this ox had taken a <i>kav</i> of flour</b> to bake into bread to eat instead of slaughtering his animal for its meat, <b>and gone and learned in the study hall</b> that although an ox that falls and hits the ground is considered <i>tereifa</i> if slaughtered immediately, <b>if</b> the animal <b>remained</b> alive <b>for twenty-four hours</b> and is then slaughtered, <b>it is fit to eat, he would not have lost</b> his <b>ox that was worth several <i>kav</i></b> of flour. The Gemara notes: <b>Apparently, Rav Naḥman maintains</b> that <b>there is an impact</b> caused even <b>by</b> a pit that is <b>less than ten</b> handbreadths, as Rav Naḥman was concerned in this case that its organs were crushed and it was fatally wounded.
<b>Rava raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> from the mishna: If any of the types of excavations <b>were less than ten handbreadths</b> deep, <b>and an ox or a donkey fell into</b> one of <b>them and died,</b> he is <b>exempt. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Is it not because there is no</b> significant <b>impact</b> capable of causing death? If so, why is this animal deemed a <i>tereifa</i>?

Daf 51a

Rav Naḥman responds: <b>No,</b> he is exempt here <b>because there are not</b> sufficient <b>fumes</b> to cause death, in accordance with the opinion of Rav. Nevertheless, the impact from hitting the ground is sufficient to cause death, and therefore an ox that fell into a water channel is suspected of being a <i>tereifa</i>. Rava again challenges him: <b>If so,</b> then how is the statement: If the animal <b>was injured by it,</b> he is <b>liable,</b> to be explained? <b>There are not</b> sufficient <b>fumes?</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: There are not</b> sufficient <b>fumes to</b> cause <b>death, but there are</b> sufficient <b>fumes to</b> cause <b>injury.</b>
Rava <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rav Naḥman from a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 45a): <b>The structure</b> from which <b>the</b> punishment of <b>stoning</b> was implemented <b>was a height of two</b> people, <b>and it is taught in that regard</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the two-person height of the structure is combined with <b>his height,</b> i.e., the height of the one being stoned, <b>there is</b> a total height equal to that of <b>three</b> people. Rava explains his objection: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>there is an impact</b> capable of causing death <b>in</b> a pit <b>less than ten</b> handbreadths deep, <b>why do I</b> need <b>all of this</b> height?
Rav Naḥman answered him: <b>And according to your reasoning, let us make</b> the structure a minimal <b>ten</b> handbreadths. Why must it have a height of two people? <b>Rather,</b> no proof can be brought from here, since the reason is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that the <b>verse states: “And you shall love your fellow as yourself”</b> (Leviticus 19:18), teaching that even with regard to a condemned prisoner, <b>select a good,</b> i.e., a compassionate, <b>death for him.</b> Therefore, the structure used for stoning is constructed sufficiently high that he dies quickly, without any unnecessary suffering.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, let us raise</b> the structure even <b>more,</b> so that his death will be even less painful. The Gemara answers: This is not done, <b>because</b> if he fell from a greater height, his organs would be crushed and he would become completely <b>disfigured,</b> which is certainly not a way one would prefer to die.
Rava again <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rav Naḥman: The Torah requires constructing a parapet on the roof of one’s house to prevent anyone from falling to his death, as the verse states (Deuteronomy 22:8): “You shall not bring blood upon your house, <b>if any man falls from it.”</b> The term <b>“from it”</b> teaches that liability exists only for falling from the roof of the house, <b>but not onto</b> the roof of a house.
<b>How</b> is this <b>so?</b> If an area in the <b>public domain was ten handbreadths higher than</b> a private house and the owner did not construct a fence between his house and the public domain, <b>and</b> someone <b>fell from inside</b> the public domain <b>onto</b> the house, the owner of the house is <b>exempt.</b> By contrast, if the public domain was <b>ten handbreadths lower than</b> the house, and the owner did not construct a fence on his roof, <b>and</b> someone <b>fell from</b> the roof of the house <b>into</b> the public domain, he is <b>liable.</b>
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>there is</b> a sufficiently strong <b>impact</b> to cause death even at a height <b>of less than ten</b> handbreadths, <b>why do I</b> need the roof to be <b>ten</b> handbreadths high for there to be a requirement to construct a parapet? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of the parapet for the roof of <b>a house is different, since any</b> structure <b>less than ten</b> handbreadths <b>is not</b> classified as <b>a house,</b> and only a house requires a parapet.
Rava objects: <b>If that is so,</b> i.e., if the requirement to build a parapet is limited to a house that is ten handbreadths high, then <b>also now, where</b> the house <b>is ten</b> handbreadths higher than the public domain when measured <b>from the outside, remove</b> the height of <b>the ceiling and the plaster,</b> which is an additional layer on top of the ceiling. When measured <b>from the inside</b> in this manner, its height <b>is not ten.</b> According to you, then, it is not classified as a house. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> It is a case <b>where he hollowed out</b> an extra space <b>inside</b> in the floor of the house so that its height would be ten handbreadths.
Rava challenges him: <b>If so,</b> in a situation <b>where</b> the house <b>is not ten</b> handbreadths <b>from the outside as well, you</b> can <b>find</b> a scenario <b>where it is ten</b> handbreadths <b>from the inside, such as where he hollowed out extra</b> space <b>in</b> the floor, thereby transforming it into a house with the required height. Why, then, would a person be exempt in this case?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the previous explanation must be entirely rejected, and <b>this is the reasoning of Rav Naḥman</b> when he ruled that one must suspect that the ox’s organs were crushed upon falling into the water channel. He <b>maintains</b> the following argument: <b>How</b> far <b>is</b> the distance <b>from the stomach of the ox to the ground?</b> It is <b>four</b> handbreadths. <b>How</b> deep <b>is the water channel?</b> It is <b>six</b> handbreadths. <b>This</b> totals <b>ten</b> handbreadths. Therefore, it <b>transpires that when</b> the ox <b>hits</b> the ground, <b>it is from</b> a height of <b>ten</b> handbreadths <b>that it hits</b> the ground, since it landed on its stomach and not on its feet.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the mishna, which teaches: Just as a pit that has sufficient</b> depth <b>to cause death</b> when falling into it is at least <b>ten handbreadths</b> deep, <b>so too, any</b> other excavations <b>that have sufficient</b> depth <b>to cause death</b> may be no less than <b>ten handbreadths</b> deep, why not say that a pit <b>with six</b> handbreadths would <b>also be sufficient?</b>
The Sages <b>said</b> in reply: <b>The mishna</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>rolled into the pit,</b> in which case the pit would be required to have a depth of ten handbreadths. By contrast, if it fell while walking, the extra height from the ground to its stomach is included in calculating the ten handbreadths.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a pit belonging to two partners</b> was uncovered and <b>the first</b> partner <b>passed by it and did not cover it, and</b> then <b>the second</b> passed by it <b>and did not cover it, the second</b> is <b>liable</b> for any damage caused by means of the pit.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages <b>say: How can you find</b> such a case of <b>a pit belonging to two partners? This works out well if we hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that one who digs <b>a pit</b> on his own property and then declares the property, but not the pit, ownerless, is <b>liable</b> for damage. According to him, <b>you find</b> such a case <b>where the courtyard belongs to both of them and the pit belongs to both of them, and they renounced ownership of their property but did not renounce ownership of their pit.</b> In that case, both are responsible for any damage caused.
<b>But if we hold</b> that one who digs <b>a pit on his</b> own <b>property</b> and then declares the property, but not the pit, ownerless, is <b>exempt</b> from liability for damage caused, <b>how can you find</b> a case of a pit <b>for which</b> a person is <b>liable?</b> It can only be a case where it is located <b>in the public domain, and how can you find</b> a case of a <b>pit belonging to two partners in the public domain?</b>
<b>If they both</b> jointly <b>appointed an agent and said to him: Go dig</b> a pit <b>for us, and he went</b> and <b>dug</b> a pit <b>for</b> both of <b>them,</b> then neither is liable. This is because <b>there is no agency for transgression,</b> and the digger is solely responsible. <b>And if this</b> partner <b>dug</b> a pit <b>five</b> handbreadths deep <b>and this</b> partner dug <b>five</b> further handbreadths deep, <b>the</b> significance of the initial <b>act of</b> digging performed by <b>the first</b> partner <b>has been removed.</b> Now all responsibility rests with the second partner, who deepened the pit to ten handbreadths, which is the minimum depth for which one is liable for an animal’s death. Therefore, this is also not treated as a jointly owned pit.
The Gemara notes: <b>This works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and you find in</b> a case of <b>damage</b> that both would be liable, as the Gemara will soon explain. Therefore, it qualifies as a case of a pit belonging to two partners. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, the first partner is not held liable at all in a case <b>where</b> the pit causes an animal’s <b>death; and according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> the first partner is not held liable both in a situation <b>where it causes death and</b> in a situation where it merely causes <b>damage.</b> If so, <b>how, can you find</b> an instance of a pit belonging to partners?
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where they both extracted a chunk</b> of earth from the bottom of the pit <b>simultaneously, and</b> thereby <b>completed</b> it <b>to</b> a depth of <b>ten</b> handbreadths. This, then, would constitute a pit belonging to both of them.
Having mentioned the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis, the Gemara inquires: <b>What</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and what</b> is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who digs a pit nine</b> handbreadths deep, <b>and another</b> person <b>came and completed</b> the digging <b>to</b> a depth of <b>ten</b> handbreadths, <b>the latter</b> individual alone is <b>liable</b> for an injury or death caused by the pit. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> One <b>follows the latter</b> for restitution <b>for death</b> caused by the pit. The latter is solely liable, since only a pit of ten handbreadths renders a person liable for an animal’s death. <b>And</b> one <b>follows both of them</b> for restitution <b>for damage</b> caused by the pit.
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the Rabbis? As the verse states: “If</b> a man <b>shall open</b> a pit, <b>or if</b> a man <b>shall dig</b> a pit” (Exodus 21:33), it raises the question: <b>If</b> he is <b>liable for opening</b> a covered pit that has already been dug, then is it <b>not all the more so</b> that he should be liable <b>for digging</b> a new pit? What, then, does that latter phrase add? <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to include</b> the case of one person who begins to <b>dig</b> a pit and <b>after</b> he does so, a second person continues to <b>dig.</b> By subsequently stating: “If a man shall dig a pit,” the Torah teaches <b>that</b> a new pit is effectively created by the second digger, whose digging <b>removed,</b> i.e., rendered irrelevant, <b>the action of the first</b> digger and who bears full responsibility for the pit.
<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi could have <b>said to you: These</b> two clauses in the verse <b>are</b> both <b>necessary,</b> and the second clause cannot serve to teach the <i>halakha</i> of the sole liability of the second digger. The reason they are necessary is <b>as we said</b> earlier (50a), where interpretations were cited according to both Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> don’t <b>the Rabbis also</b> agree that they <b>are necessary</b> for those interpretations? If so, what is the source of their opinion that responsibility for the pit rests solely with the second partner?
<b>Rather,</b> the previous explanation must be rejected, and <b>this is the reason of the Rabbis:</b> The <b>verse states: “If a man shall dig a pit,”</b> indicating that <b>one</b> person is liable, <b>but not two.</b> Therefore, if two people jointly created the pit, the second bears responsibility and not the first.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi understand the phrase “if a man shall dig a pit”? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> phrase to teach another <i>halakha</i>. The phrase <b>“if a man shall dig a pit”</b> indicates that a person who digs a pit is liable, <b>but</b> one is <b>not</b> liable if his <b>ox</b> digs a <b>pit.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where do <b>the Rabbis</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers that the combination of words: <b>Man</b> and <b>pit,</b> is <b>written twice:</b> “If a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit.” From one phrase, the <i>halakha</i> is derived that a person must do the digging, and not an animal. From the second phrase, the <i>halakha</i> is derived that one person bears responsibility for the damage, and not two people.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi derive from this repetition? The Gemara answers: In his opinion, <b>since</b> the Torah <b>wrote this</b> first clause using this wording, it similarly <b>wrote this</b> second clause in the same fashion. The repetition is for stylistic reasons, and is not meant to teach a new <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara continues to ask about the opinion of the Rabbis: <b>And</b> even if they derive from the verse that only one person is liable for damage caused through the pit, <b>from where</b> do they know <b>that</b> the Torah intends <b>to render</b> specifically <b>the latter one liable</b> for the damage? <b>Perhaps</b> it is <b>to render the first one</b> who started the digging <b>liable</b> for the damage.
The Gemara answers: It should <b>not enter your mind</b> to suggest this, <b>since the verse states: “And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:34). This indicates that it is <b>the one who causes the death,</b> i.e., the second one, who is liable, and not the first. This is because it is the second one who completed digging the necessary depth for causing death, and not the first.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> isn’t <b>this</b> clause: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him,” necessary for that which Rava</b> states? <b>As Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a disqualified consecrated ox that fell into a pit,</b> the pit’s owner is <b>exempt, as it is stated: “And the carcass shall be for him.”</b> Evidently, the verse is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case <b>where the carcass belongs</b> to him. This ox, which was consecrated and subsequently disqualified, does not fully belong to anybody, since its use is restricted. Since this verse serves to teach Rava’s ruling, it cannot serve to teach about the liability of the second digger.
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: <b>And can’t you learn from</b> the words and emphasis of the verse <b>by itself that we are dealing with the one who caused</b> the animal’s <b>death,</b> even if these words are also used to derive Rava’s ruling? Therefore, the verse can serve as a source for both rulings.
On a similar subject, <b>the Sages taught:</b> In a case of <b>one who digs a pit</b> to a depth of <b>ten</b> handbreadths, <b>and another comes and completes</b> the depth <b>to twenty</b> handbreadths by digging an additional ten handbreadths, <b>and another comes and completes it to thirty,</b> they are <b>all liable</b> for any damage caused by this pit. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> against this from a <i>baraita</i>: In a case of <b>one who digs a pit</b> to a depth of <b>ten</b> handbreadths, <b>and another came and plastered</b> it <b>and cemented [<i>vekhiyyeid</i>]</b> it, <b>the latter</b> is <b>liable</b> for damage, and not the first.

Daf 51b

<b>Shall we say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that they are all liable, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, who holds both liable for digging, <b>and this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which holds the latter liable, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold only the last one liable?
<b>Rav Zevid said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The way the first <i>baraita</i> accords with their opinion is that <b>the Rabbis say</b> that <b>the last one</b> is <b>liable only where the first</b> one <b>did not make the</b> pit of sufficient <b>measurement</b> to cause <b>death,</b> but dug less than ten handbreadths. <b>But where the first one made</b> a pit of sufficient <b>measurement</b> to cause <b>death,</b> such as in this case, where the first one dug ten handbreadths himself and it was subsequently deepened further by others, <b>even the Rabbis concede that they are all liable.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, where <b>he plastered and cemented</b> it, <b>the first made</b> a pit of sufficient <b>measurement</b> to cause <b>death, and</b> nevertheless, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>the last person</b> is <b>liable. They said</b> in response: <b>There</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the pit <b>did not have fumes</b> capable of leading <b>to death,</b> since it was very wide. <b>And</b> then <b>the other came, and</b> by narrowing it with plaster and cementing it, <b>he added to it</b> the characteristic of having <b>fumes</b> capable of leading <b>to death.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this is what <b>Rav Zevid said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>This</b> first <i>baraita</i>, <b>which teaches: They are all liable,</b> fits <b>well</b> with his opinion. <b>That</b> second <i>baraita</i>, <b>which teaches: The last one</b> alone is <b>liable,</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the pit <b>did not have</b> sufficient <b>fumes in it</b> that were capable of leading to <b>either death or damage, and</b> then <b>another</b> person <b>came and</b> by narrowing it with plaster and cementing it, <b>he added to it</b> the characteristic of having <b>fumes</b> capable of leading <b>to both death and damage.</b>
Elaborating on this subject, <b>Rava says:</b> With regard to one who <b>placed a stone at the opening of a pit</b> less than ten handbreadths deep <b>and brings</b> the pit <b>to</b> a depth of <b>ten</b> handbreadths by raising the ground next to the opening of the pit, <b>we have arrived at the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and the Rabbis</b> concerning whether only the second or both are responsible for damage caused.
The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> this <b>obvious?</b> This is precisely the case they are disputing, so what does Rava’s statement add to this? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that there is a distinction between a person deepening a pit <b>at the bottom,</b> in which case it <b>is his</b> lethal <b>fumes</b> that he caused <b>that kill</b> the animal, <b>but</b> if he added to the pit <b>at the top, where it is not his</b> lethal <b>fumes</b> that <b>kill</b> the animal, <b>say</b> that he would <b>not</b> be liable. Rava’s statement <b>teaches us</b> that the last one is liable, and this case is subject to dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and the Rabbis as to whether only the last one or both are liable.
<b>Rava raises</b> the following <b>dilemma:</b> If someone dug another handbreadth in a pit that was nine handbreadths deep, so that it reached a depth of ten handbreadths, and subsequently <b>closed up</b> that <b>handbreadth</b> inside the pit, <b>or</b> if <b>he removed his stones</b> that he had placed at the opening of the pit so that the depth of the pit was reduced to less than ten handbreadths, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say that what he did</b> to increase the depth of the pit to ten handbreadths, <b>he has</b> removed, and restored the initial situation that existed before he dug the extra handbreadth, causing responsibility for damage to revert solely to the original digger?
<b>Or perhaps,</b> by closing it up, he <b>removed the action of</b> the <b>first</b> digger, since he has removed the ability of the pit to cause death? If so, it <b>moves entirely into his possession</b> and he now assumes full responsibility for the pit of nine handbreadths. The Gemara concludes: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Shmuel bar Marta says:</b> With regard to <b>a pit</b> that is <b>eight</b> handbreadths deep and <b>two handbreadths of it</b> contain <b>water,</b> one is <b>liable</b> for it. <b>What is the reason? Each handbreadth of water is like two</b> handbreadths <b>of dry space.</b> Therefore, the pit is effectively ten handbreadths in depth and contains a sufficient quantity of lethal fumes to render its owner liable.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If <b>a pit</b> is <b>nine</b> handbreadths deep, <b>and from that</b> measurement, <b>one handbreadth</b> contains <b>water, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this case equivalent to the previous one? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since</b> there is <b>not</b> as <b>large</b> a quantity of <b>water</b> as in the case stated by Rabba bar bar Ḥana, the pit <b>does not have</b> a sufficient quantity of lethal <b>fumes</b> to render the digger liable? <b>Or perhaps</b> it can be argued that <b>since</b> the pit is <b>deeper</b> than the one in the previous case, <b>it does have</b> lethal <b>fumes,</b> despite containing less water?
Similarly, the following question can be raised: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>a pit</b> is <b>seven</b> handbreadths deep <b>and three of the handbreadths</b> contain <b>water? Do we say</b> that <b>since</b> there is a <b>much larger</b> quantity <b>of water</b> in this case, it is equivalent to a pit of ten handbreadths and therefore <b>has</b> lethal <b>fumes, or perhaps since it is not</b> as <b>deep, it does not have</b> a sufficient quantity of lethal <b>fumes</b> to render the digger liable? The Gemara concludes: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Sheizevi asked</b> the following question <b>of Rabba:</b> If one <b>widened</b> the opening of a pit that was already ten handbreadths deep, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabba <b>said to him:</b> By doing so, <b>he has</b> actually <b>reduced the</b> lethal <b>fumes</b> and has not worsened the situation. Therefore, he should not be liable. Rav Sheizevi <b>said to him: On the contrary,</b> by widening the opening of the pit, <b>he has brought the</b> potential for <b>damage closer</b> to an animal that might fall inside.
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said</b> concerning this question: <b>Let us see: If</b> the animal <b>died because of the</b> lethal <b>fumes,</b> the one who widened the pit should be exempt, since <b>he reduced the</b> lethal <b>fumes.</b> But <b>if</b> the animal <b>died because of the impact,</b> he should be liable, since <b>he has brought the</b> potential for <b>damage closer</b> to it. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Ashi said: Let us see: If</b> the animal <b>fell on that side</b> that he widened, then his action <b>has brought the</b> potential for <b>damage closer,</b> and so he should be liable. But <b>if</b> the animal <b>fell on the other side,</b> he should bear no responsibility, since <b>he reduced the</b> lethal <b>fumes.</b>
<b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>a pit whose depth is equal to its width, Rabba and Rav Yosef both say</b> a ruling <b>in the name of Rabba bar bar Ḥana, who says</b> it <b>in the name of Rabbi Mani,</b> but each present it differently. <b>One</b> of them <b>says:</b> A pit <b>always contains</b> a quantity of lethal <b>fumes</b> sufficient for liability, <b>unless its width is greater than its depth.</b> Therefore, when they are equal, the digger is liable. <b>And one says:</b> A pit <b>never contains</b> a quantity of lethal <b>fumes</b> sufficient for liability, <b>unless its depth is greater than its width.</b> Consequently, when they are equal, the digger is exempt.
§ The mishna teaches that if <b>the first</b> partner <b>passed by</b> the pit <b>and did not cover it,</b> and then the second also passed by it and did not cover it, the second is liable. The Gemara asks: <b>And from what point is the first exempt</b> from responsibility for the pit? <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both say</b> a ruling <b>in the name of Rabba bar bar Ḥana, who says</b> it <b>in the name of Rabbi Mani,</b> but each one presents it differently: <b>One says: From</b> the time <b>he leaves</b> the other partner <b>using it, and one says:</b> The first is absolved of responsibility only <b>when he conveys to him his bucket,</b> with which he will draw water from the pit.
The Gemara notes: This dispute is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one <b>who draws water from a cistern, and his friend comes and says to him: Leave me and I will draw water, once</b> the first person <b>leaves</b> the second person while the second is <b>using</b> the cistern, the first is now <b>exempt</b> if he did not cover it. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> The first person is not absolved of responsibility until the time <b>when he conveys his bucket to</b> the second person.
The Gemara clarifies the dispute: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> they <b>disagree? Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov maintains</b> that <b>there is</b> a legal concept of <b>designation.</b> According to this principle, a situation in which certain aspects were not initially clearly defined can become clarified retroactively after a certain action or event occurs. The <i>halakha</i> treats all the aspects as being clearly defined and identifiable from the outset.
In this case, the water is considered divided between the partners even before they draw it. When they do draw it, it is treated as if <b>this one were filling from his</b> part, the location of which has now been determined retroactively, <b>and this one were filling from his</b> part. Therefore, as long as the first partner has not conveyed his bucket to the second, he, as an owner of a defined part of the water, has not absolved himself of responsibility for the cistern. <b>And</b> by contrast, <b>the Rabbis maintain</b> that <b>there is no designation</b> and they both have the right to draw water from the cistern. Therefore, as soon as the second partner is left alone to draw water, he is responsible for the cistern and all the water it contains, even without conveying the bucket.
<b>Ravina said: And</b> in this regard, they <b>follow</b> their lines of <b>reasoning</b> in an analogous case, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 45b): With regard to <b>the</b> case of <b>partners that vowed</b> not to derive any <b>benefit from each other,</b> it is <b>prohibited for them to enter</b> their jointly owned <b>courtyard,</b> as this would violate their vows. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> It is permitted for them to enter the courtyard, since <b>this one enters into his</b> portion of the courtyard <b>and that one enters into his</b> portion.
The Gemara explains: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov maintains</b> that <b>there is</b> retroactive <b>designation,</b> and retroactively the section of the courtyard that each one enters becomes the portion that belongs to him. Therefore, <b>this one enters his</b> part, <b>and that one enters his</b> part. By contrast, <b>the Rabbis maintain</b> that <b>there is no</b> retroactive <b>designation,</b> and each portion of the courtyard belongs jointly to both.
§ Having mentioned this <i>halakha</i> concerning conveying a bucket to transfer responsibility for the pit, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> With regard to <b>one who sells a cistern to another, once</b> the seller <b>conveys his bucket to</b> the buyer for drawing water from the cistern, the buyer <b>acquires</b> the cistern. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances?</b> How does conveying the bucket serve to effect acquisition of the cistern? <b>If</b> he is acquiring the cistern <b>by</b> means of paying <b>money, let him acquire</b> it <b>with money</b> that he paid. <b>If</b> he is acquiring the cistern <b>by</b> means of <b>taking possession,</b> then <b>let</b> him <b>acquire</b> it <b>by taking possession,</b> which is accomplished by using it.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the case is <b>where</b> the cistern was acquired through <b>taking possession, and</b> in that case, the seller usually <b>must say to him: Go, take possession, and</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> it for yourself. <b>And</b> in this case, <b>when he conveys his bucket to him, he is like one who says to him: Go, take possession, and</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> it. Therefore, once he begins drawing water from the cistern, he has acquired it through taking possession.
The Gemara cites a related ruling: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> If one <b>sells a house to another,</b>

Daf 52a

<b>once he has conveyed the key to him, he has acquired</b> it.
Here too, the Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> involving this sale? <b>If</b> it was a transaction <b>by</b> payment of <b>money,</b> then <b>let</b> him <b>acquire</b> it <b>by</b> paying <b>money. If</b> it was <b>by taking possession</b> of it, <b>let</b> him <b>acquire</b> it <b>by taking possession.</b> What is the significance of transferring the key? The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the transaction occurred by <b>taking possession, and</b> in that case, the seller usually <b>must say to him: Go, take possession, and</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> it for yourself. <b>And</b> in this case, <b>once he conveys the key to him,</b> he is considered <b>like one who says to him: Go, take possession, and</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> it.
Similarly, <b>Reish Lakish says in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> With regard to one <b>who sells a flock</b> of sheep <b>to another, once he conveys the <i>mashkukhit</i> to</b> the buyer, <b>he has acquired</b> the flock.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If</b> the transaction occurred <b>by pulling</b> the flock into his possession, then <b>let</b> the buyer <b>acquire</b> it <b>by pulling. If</b> it was <b>by conveying</b> it, <b>let</b> the buyer <b>acquire</b> it <b>by</b> the seller <b>conveying</b> it. The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> it was a transaction <b>by pulling, and</b> in that case, the seller usually <b>must say to him: Go, pull</b> it <b>and acquire</b> it for yourself. <b>And</b> in this case, <b>once he conveys the <i>mashkukhit</i> to him,</b> he is <b>like one who says to him: Go, pull</b> it <b>and acquire</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this <b><i>mashkukhit</i>? Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they translate</b> it as <b>a bell [<i>karkashta</i>]</b> that the shepherd rings and whose sound the flock follows. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says:</b> It is referring to <b>the goat that goes at the front</b> of <b>the flock</b> that they follow. The Gemara notes: This explanation of Rabbi Ya’akov is similar to <b>that which a certain Galilean taught in the presence of Rav Ḥisda concerning</b> this goat: <b>When a shepherd is angry with his flock, he renders</b> the goat <b>leading [<i>lenaggada</i>]</b> them, i.e., the <i>mashkukhit</i>, <b>blind.</b> Similarly, when God is angry with the Jewish people, he appoints unsuitable leaders for them.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna lists several <i>halakhot</i> that pertain to damage classified as Pit: In the case of a pit that <b>the first</b> person who passed by <b>covered</b> after using <b>it, and</b> then <b>the second came</b> to use it <b>and found it uncovered</b> after the cover fell off or was damaged, <b>and</b> he <b>did not cover it, the second</b> one is <b>liable</b> for damage caused by the pit. If the owner <b>covered</b> the pit <b>appropriately and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> If he <b>did not cover</b> the pit <b>appropriately and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died,</b> he is <b>liable.</b>
If a man was digging or widening a pit, and an ox passing by <b>fell forward</b> into it in fright <b>due to the sound</b> of <b>the digging,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> If it fell <b>backward</b> into the pit <b>due to the sound</b> of <b>the digging,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
If <b>an ox and its accoutrements,</b> i.e., the vessels it was carrying, <b>fell into</b> the pit <b>and</b> the vessels <b>were broken,</b> or if <b>a donkey and its accoutrements</b> fell in <b>and</b> the accoutrements <b>were torn,</b> the owner of the pit is <b>liable for</b> damage to <b>the animal</b> caused by the pit, <b>but</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability <b>for</b> damage caused to <b>the vessels,</b> by Torah edict.
If <b>an ox</b> that was impaired by being <b>deaf,</b> or an ox that was <b>an imbecile, or</b> an ox that was very <b>young fell into</b> the pit, he is <b>liable.</b> If <b>a boy or a girl,</b> a Canaanite <b>slave or</b> a Canaanite <b>maidservant</b> fell in, he is <b>exempt,</b> since there is a Torah edict that the digger of a pit is liable only for damage caused to an animal.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the first case in the mishna, the Gemara asks: <b>And until when</b> is <b>the first</b> person <b>exempt</b> if the pit is later uncovered? <b>Rav says:</b> He is exempt from liability for the time necessary <b>for</b> him <b>to</b> become <b>aware</b> that it became uncovered. Once this time has passed, he bears responsibility. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> He is exempt for the time necessary <b>for</b> others <b>to</b> realize that the pit is uncovered and <b>inform him. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He is exempt for the time necessary <b>for</b> others <b>to inform him</b> that the cover has fallen down <b>and</b> for him to <b>hire workers and cut cedar trees</b> to make a suitable cover <b>and cover it.</b> After this period of time has passed, the first bears responsibility.
§ The mishna teaches: If he <b>covered</b> the pit <b>appropriately and an ox or a donkey fell inside and died,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Since he covered</b> the pit <b>appropriately, how</b> did it <b>fall</b> in? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar bar Ḥana says:</b> This is a case <b>where</b> the cover <b>rotted from the inside,</b> and he could not have known that the cover was damaged. Therefore, he is not responsible for damage caused as a result.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If he <b>covered it</b> with <b>a cover that</b> is <b>able to withstand</b> the weight of <b>oxen but cannot withstand</b> the weight of <b>camels,</b> which are heavier, <b>and camels came and weakened it, and</b> subsequently <b>oxen came</b> and broke the weakened cover <b>and fell into</b> the pit, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Sages <b>said</b> in response: <b>What are the circumstances? If camels are</b> commonly <b>found</b> there, <b>he is negligent,</b> since he should have constructed the cover suitably for camels as well. And <b>if camels are not</b> commonly <b>found</b> there, then <b>he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control</b> if by chance they did come and weaken the cover.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> camels <b>come occasionally,</b> in which case the question effectively becomes: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since they come occasionally, he is</b> considered <b>negligent, since he should have anticipated</b> their coming? <b>Or perhaps since now, in any event, there are no</b> camels, <b>he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a possible proof from the mishna: If he <b>covered</b> the pit <b>appropriately, and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> Now <b>what are the circumstances? If we say</b> that he covered it <b>appropriately for oxen and appropriately for camels,</b> then <b>how</b> did they <b>fall</b> in? <b>Rather, is it not</b> the case that he covered it with a covering that was <b>appropriate for oxen</b>

Daf 52b

<b>but not appropriate for camels?</b> In this case, the following must be clarified: <b>If</b> it is a location <b>where camels are</b> commonly <b>found, why</b> is he <b>exempt? He is negligent. And if camels are not</b> commonly <b>found</b> there, it <b>is obvious</b> that he is exempt, since <b>he is</b> clearly <b>a victim of circumstances beyond his control. Rather, is it not</b> the case that this is a location <b>where</b> camels <b>come occasionally, and camels came and weakened</b> the covering, after which <b>oxen came and fell into it? And</b> with regard to this case, <b>it teaches</b> that he is <b>exempt. Apparently, since now,</b> in any event, the camels <b>are not</b> there, he is considered <b>a victim of circumstances beyond his control.</b>
<b>They said</b> in reply: <b>No; actually,</b> the scenario is where he covered it <b>appropriately for oxen and appropriately for camels, and as for</b> what was <b>difficult for you</b> to explain: <b>How did they fall? Rabbi Yitzḥak bar bar Ḥana says:</b> It is <b>where</b> the cover <b>rotted from the inside,</b> and so nothing can be derived from here with regard to the question posed above with regard to the camels.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different proof from the mishna: If he <b>did not cover</b> the pit <b>appropriately, and an ox or a donkey fell in and died,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> Now, <b>what are the circumstances? If we say</b> that he did <b>not</b> cover it <b>appropriately for oxen and</b> he did <b>not</b> cover it <b>appropriately for camels,</b> and they fell in, it <b>is obvious.</b> Does it <b>need to be said that</b> he is <b>liable</b> in that case? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case where he covered it <b>appropriately for oxen but not appropriately for camels?</b> And if this is the case, the following point must be clarified: <b>What are the circumstances? If camels are</b> commonly <b>found</b> there, <b>he is</b> clearly <b>negligent, but if camels are not</b> commonly <b>found</b> there, <b>he is a victim of circumstances beyond his control.</b>
<b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> camels <b>come occasionally, and camels came and weakened it, and</b> subsequently <b>oxen came and fell into it? And</b> in this case, it <b>teaches</b> that he is <b>liable. Apparently, since they</b> do <b>come occasionally, he is</b> considered <b>negligent, since he should have anticipated</b> that they would come.
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> it is possible that he covered it <b>appropriately for oxen</b> but <b>not appropriately for camels, and camels are</b> commonly <b>found</b> there. <b>And as for</b> what was <b>difficult for you</b> to explain: In such a case <b>he is</b> considered <b>negligent</b> and should be liable, rendering the ruling in the mishna superfluous, one may answer that <b>since</b> the <i>tanna</i> needs to <b>cite the first clause</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> if he <b>covered it appropriately, he cites the latter clause as well,</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that if he <b>did not cover it appropriately, he is liable.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the discussion is as follows: With regard to <b>this also we certainly did not raise the dilemma,</b> because <b>since they occasionally come, he is</b> considered <b>negligent, as he should have anticipated</b> this possibility.
<b>When we raised the dilemma, this is the dilemma that we raised:</b> He <b>covered it</b> with <b>a cover that is able</b> to <b>withstand the presence of oxen but is unable to withstand the presence of camels, and camels are</b> commonly <b>found</b> in that location. What actually transpired was that the cover <b>rotted from</b> the <b>inside.</b> In this case, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say: Since he was negligent concerning camels, he is</b> considered <b>negligent also concerning</b> the <b>rotting? Or perhaps we do not say</b> that <b>since</b> he was negligent concerning camels he is considered negligent concerning rotting, and since in practice he is not to blame for the incident, he is not held liable?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: If <b>he covered</b> the pit <b>appropriately and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died,</b> he is <b>exempt. And</b> it <b>was stated with regard to</b> this that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar bar Ḥana says:</b> This <i>halakha</i> applies <b>where</b> the cover <b>rotted from the inside.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that it is referring to where he covered it in a manner <b>appropriate for oxen and appropriate for camels and</b> it <b>rotted from the inside,</b> isn’t it <b>obvious that</b> he is <b>exempt?</b> Being unaware of this, <b>what should he have done?</b>
<b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case where he covered it <b>appropriately for oxen</b> but <b>not appropriately for camels, and camels are</b> commonly <b>found</b> in that location? <b>And</b> the strength of the cover vis-à-vis oxen and camels is not relevant to the <i>halakha</i> here because the cover <b>rotted from the inside. And</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that he is <b>exempt. Apparently, we do not say</b> that <b>since he is</b> considered <b>negligent concerning camels, he is</b> also considered <b>negligent with regard to the rotting.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No; actually,</b> the case is where the cover was <b>appropriate for camels and appropriate for oxen, and</b> it <b>rotted from the inside. And as for</b> what was <b>difficult for you</b> to explain: <b>When</b> it <b>rotted</b> from the inside, <b>what should he have done,</b> and shouldn’t he be exempt? There is, nevertheless, a novelty in this ruling: It is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>he should have gone and knocked on</b> the covering to ensure it was not hollow on the inside. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that he is not required to check to this extent.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the continuation of the mishna: If he <b>did not cover</b> the pit <b>appropriately and an ox or a donkey fell into it and died,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that it is referring to where he did <b>not</b> cover it <b>appropriately for oxen and</b> did <b>not</b> cover it <b>appropriately for camels,</b> does it <b>need to be said that</b> he is <b>liable?</b>
<b>Rather, is it not</b> a case where he covered it <b>appropriately for oxen</b> but <b>not appropriately for camels?</b> In this case, the following point needs clarification: <b>If camels are</b> commonly <b>found</b> there, <b>he is negligent</b> and should be liable. <b>And if camels are not</b> commonly <b>found</b> there, he is <b>a victim of circumstances beyond his control. Rather, is it not</b> a case <b>where camels are</b> commonly <b>found</b> there, <b>and it rotted from the inside,</b> and the mishna <b>teaches</b> that he is <b>liable? Apparently, we</b> do <b>say</b> that <b>since he is negligent concerning the camels, he is</b> considered <b>negligent concerning the rotting,</b> and he is therefore liable.
<b>They said</b> in response: <b>No; actually</b> it is referring to where he covered the pit <b>appropriately for oxen</b> but <b>not appropriately for camels; and camels are</b> commonly <b>found</b> there, <b>and camels came and weakened</b> the cover. <b>And,</b> subsequently, <b>oxen came and fell in. And as for</b> what was <b>difficult for you</b> to explain: It <b>is obvious</b> that he is liable, since <b>he is</b> clearly <b>negligent,</b> so what novelty is being introduced? The answer is that <b>since he</b> needs to <b>cite the first clause</b> of the mishna, i.e., where he <b>covered</b> the pit <b>appropriately, he</b> therefore <b>cites the latter clause as well,</b> i.e., where he <b>did not cover it.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different proof from a baraita: With regard to<b>an ox</b> that was impaired by being <b>deaf</b>, or an ox that was <b>an imbecile, or</b> an ox that was very <b>young,</b> or <b>a blind</b> ox, <b>or</b> an ox that <b>is walking at night</b> and unable to see, if it <b>fell into</b> the pit, he is <b>liable.</b> If the ox was of <b>standard intelligence</b> for its species <b>and</b> was <b>walking in the day,</b> the owner of the pit is <b>exempt,</b> since the ox should have been aware of the pit. The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is he exempt? <b>Let us say that since he is</b> considered <b>negligent concerning</b> a <b>deaf</b> ox<b>, he is also negligent concerning</b> an ox of <b>standard intelligence. Rather, is it not</b> correct to <b>conclude</b> the following principle <b>from</b> here: <b>We do not say</b> that <b>since</b> he is negligent with regard to one matter, it is also considered negligence with regard to another matter, but he is held liable only for the damage actually attributable to his negligence? The Gemara affirms: Yes, <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that this is so.
§ The mishna teaches: If a man was digging or widening a pit, and an ox passing by <b>fell forward</b> into it in fright due to the sound of the digging, he is liable. If it fell backward into the pit due to the sound of the digging, he is exempt. <b>Rav says:</b> The term <b>forward</b> means <b>literally forward,</b> and the term <b>backward</b> means <b>literally backward,</b>

Daf 53a

<b>and</b> both <b>this and that</b> refer <b>to</b> where it fell into <b>the pit</b> itself, but nevertheless if it fell backward, he is exempt.
The Gemara notes: <b>Rav</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rav says:</b> Damage classified as <b>Pit for which the Torah obligates him</b> to pay is referring specifically <b>to</b> damage caused by the pit’s lethal <b>fumes,</b> such as if an animal suffocates inside it, <b>but not to</b> damage caused by the <b>impact</b> of hitting the ground, for which he is exempt from paying compensation. Since the ox in this case fell backward on its back, the owner of the pit is exempt from paying compensation, as the ox wasn’t killed by the lethal fumes of the pit, but by the impact of the fall.
<b>And Shmuel says:</b> If the ox fell <b>into the pit, whether</b> it fell <b>forward</b> or <b>whether</b> it fell <b>backward,</b> he is <b>liable.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>Shmuel</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as</b> Shmuel <b>says:</b> With regard to damage classified as Pit, the Torah holds one liable for damage caused <b>by its</b> lethal <b>fumes, and all the more so for</b> damage resulting from the <b>impact</b> of the fall. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to Shmuel, <b>what are the circumstances</b> concerning which the mishna stated that if the ox fell <b>backward</b> into the pit <b>due to the sound of the digging that</b> one is <b>exempt?</b> The Gemara answers: This applies, <b>for example, where</b> the ox <b>stumbled on the pit, and</b> then <b>fell behind the pit</b> and was injured <b>outside the pit.</b>
The Sages <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rav from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard <b>to</b> an animal that fell into <b>a pit, whether</b> it fell in <b>forward</b> or <b>whether</b> it fell in <b>backward,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> This constitutes <b>a conclusive refutation of Rav.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> in explanation of how Rav’s opinion could accord with the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rav concedes</b> in the case <b>of a pit on his</b> own <b>property that</b> a person is <b>liable</b> even if the animal fell backward, <b>because</b> the owner of the animal can <b>say to</b> the owner of the pit: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, you are liable. <b>If</b> my animal <b>died</b> due <b>to the</b> lethal <b>fumes,</b> these <b>are your</b> lethal <b>fumes. If</b> it <b>died</b> on account <b>of the impact,</b> this <b>is the impact</b> of <b>your</b> land, and not the impact of land in the public domain, which is the typical case of Pit.
<b>Rabba said</b> that this is how the <i>baraita</i> should be explained according to Rav: <b>Here we are dealing with where</b> the animal <b>tumbled,</b> i.e., <b>where</b> it began to <b>fall on its face, and</b> afterward <b>tumbled and</b> continued to <b>fall on its back.</b> In this case, he is liable <b>because the</b> lethal <b>fumes, which were effective</b> in injuring the animal, <b>were</b> also <b>effective</b> in killing <b>it.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef said: Here,</b> in this <i>baraita</i>, <b>we are dealing with damage</b> to <b>the pit</b> that is caused <b>by the ox.</b> And <b>what is</b> the damage? The damage is <b>that it contaminated the water</b> in the pit, in which case the <i>baraita</i> states <b>that</b> it makes <b>no difference</b> if the animal fell <b>forward and</b> it makes <b>no difference</b> if it fell <b>backward,</b> since he <b>is liable</b> either way.
<b>Rav Ḥananya taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in support of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav:</b> The verse states with regard to damage caused by a pit to an animal: <b>“And</b> an ox or a donkey <b>fall</b> therein” (Exodus 21:33), which is interpreted to mean that one is not liable <b>unless</b> the animal <b>falls</b> in the usual <b>manner of falling. From here</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> that if it <b>fell forward due to the sound of the digging,</b> he is <b>liable,</b> but if it fell <b>backward due to the sound of the digging,</b> he is <b>exempt, and</b> both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case refer to damage <b>by a pit.</b>
§ <b>The Master said</b> in the mishna: If it <b>fell forward due to the sound of the digging,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is this so? <b>Let us say</b> that it is the sound of <b>the digger</b> that <b>caused</b> the animal to fall, and not the pit itself. The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Shimi bar Ashi said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this?</b> It <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan, who says: The owner</b> of <b>the pit causes the damage</b> by his digging, <b>and anywhere that</b> it is <b>not possible to collect</b> payment <b>from this</b> one who caused the fall, i.e., the digger, payment is <b>collected from that</b> one, i.e., the owner of the pit. This is because in any event, he bears responsibility for the hazard he created.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an ox that pushed another</b> ox <b>into a pit, the owner of the</b> first <b>ox</b> is <b>liable,</b> and <b>the owner of the pit</b> is <b>exempt. Rabbi Natan says: The owner of the</b> first <b>ox pays half</b> the amount, <b>and the owner of the pit pays half</b> the amount.
The Gemara clarifies Rabbi Natan’s opinion: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> If an ox pushed another ox into a pit, <b>the owner of the pit pays three-quarters, and the owner of the</b> first <b>ox</b> pays <b>one-quarter?</b> The Gemara resolves the contradiction: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> second <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to an innocuous</b> ox that pushed the second ox. Therefore, the owner of the ox that caused damage pays only one-quarter of the cost of the damage, which is half of the half for which he is responsible. By contrast, <b>that</b> other <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a forewarned</b> ox that pushed a second ox. Consequently, the owner of the forewarned ox pays the full amount for which he is responsible, i.e., half the value of the total damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard <b>to an innocuous</b> ox, <b>what does</b> Rabbi Natan <b>hold</b> as to why this person pays one-quarter and the owner of the pit pays three-quarters? <b>If he holds</b> that <b>this</b> one, i.e., the ox, <b>performed all the damage and the other,</b> i.e., the pit, <b>performed</b> all the damage, then he should have ruled that <b>this</b> one <b>pays half and that</b> one <b>pays half,</b> since they are both fully responsible. Although the ox was innocuous, the owner is still liable to pay half the cost of the damage, as that is the liability incurred for an act of damaging by an innocuous ox.
<b>And if</b> Rabbi Natan <b>holds</b> that <b>this</b> one, i.e., the owner of the ox, <b>performed half the damage, and that</b> one, i.e., the owner of the pit, <b>performed half the damage,</b> then <b>the owner of the pit</b> should <b>pay half</b> of the amount for which he is responsible, i.e., half the cost of the damage, <b>and the owner of the</b> innocuous <b>ox</b> should pay only <b>one-quarter,</b> which is half the amount for which he is responsible. As for <b>the other</b> remaining <b>quarter,</b> the injured party has no recourse to claim it, and <b>loses</b> it. Why, then, does Rabbi Natan hold that the owner of the pit pays for three-quarters of the damage?
<b>Rava said: Rabbi Natan is a judge and</b> has <b>plumbed the full depths of the <i>halakha</i>. Actually, he holds</b> that <b>this</b> one <b>performed all of the damage and that</b> one <b>performed all of the damage. And as</b> for <b>your difficulty,</b> that <b>this</b> one <b>should pay half and that</b> one should pay <b>half,</b> that is not difficult. The owner of the ox pays only one-quarter, <b>because the owner of the ox</b> can <b>say to the owner of the pit: How</b> did <b>my partnership</b> with you in this situation <b>help me?</b> Even if my ox caused all the damage and none of the damage was caused by the pit, I would be required to pay only half the cost of the damage. Therefore, as we are partners in this situation, I should pay half of what I should have paid, which is one-quarter. You should pay the other half of what I should have paid, in addition to your share, since you would have had to pay full damages.
The Gemara adds: <b>If you wish, say</b> instead a different explanation: <b>Actually,</b> Rabbi Natan <b>maintains</b> that <b>this</b> one <b>performed half the damage and that</b> one <b>performed half the damage. As</b> for <b>your difficulty</b> with the fact that the <b>owner of the pit</b> should <b>pay half and the owner of the ox</b> should <b>pay one-quarter, and</b> the injured party <b>loses the other</b> remaining <b>quarter,</b> that is not difficult. This is <b>because the owner of the</b> killed <b>ox</b> can <b>say to the owner of the pit: I found my ox in your pit.</b> Consequently, I am assuming that <b>you killed it.</b> Therefore, concerning <b>that</b> portion of the payment <b>that I can receive from the other,</b> i.e., the owner of the damaging ox, <b>I will receive</b> it. Concerning <b>that</b> portion <b>that I am unable to receive from the other</b> individual, <b>I will receive it from you.</b>
On the same subject, <b>Rava says:</b> If one <b>left a stone at the opening of a pit</b> belonging to another person, <b>and an ox came and stumbled on it and fell into the pit, we have arrived at the dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis</b> concerning the division of responsibility between them. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious,</b> since what is the difference whether the ox fell into the pit due to another ox pushing it or due to the stone?
The Gemara answers: This ruling needed to be stated explicitly, <b>lest you say</b> that only <b>there the owner of the pit</b> can <b>say to the owner of the ox</b> who was responsible for the damage: <b>If not</b> for <b>my pit, your ox would have killed</b> the second ox anyway, in which case my pit was not the cause of the damage, <b>but here, the owner of the stone can say to the owner of the pit: If not</b> for <b>your pit, what would my stone have done? If</b> the ox <b>would have stumbled on it,</b> it <b>would have</b> simply <b>fallen and gotten up,</b> and I should be exempt. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that this claim is not a valid one, <b>because</b> the owner of the pit can <b>say</b> in response <b>to</b> the owner of the stone: <b>If not for</b> your <b>stone,</b> the ox <b>would not have fallen into the pit</b> in the first place.
§ It <b>was stated:</b>

Daf 53b

There is a dispute with regard to a case of an ordinary innocuous <b>ox and a disqualified consecrated ox that gored</b> another ox together. <b>What is</b> this case of an ox that was consecrated and disqualified? It is <b>a firstborn ox that</b> became blemished and was consequently disqualified as an offering. Nevertheless, its initial consecration remains, and therefore it may <b>not</b> be <b>redeemed.</b> Consequently, the priest in possession of it is not liable to pay damages, since it is not classified as: The ox of another, as its status is not that of a non-sacred ox belonging to a person. Given this background, what is the liability of the owner of the non-sacred ox that gored together with it? <b>Abaye says: He pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> whereas <b>Ravina says: He pays one-quarter of</b> the cost of <b>the damage.</b>
The Gemara explains the dispute: Both <b>this</b> one, Abaye, <b>and that</b> one, Ravina, refer <b>to</b> a case where the ordinary ox was <b>innocuous. This</b> opinion stated by Ravina is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> that each party is responsible for only half the damage. Since the non-sacred ox was innocuous, its owner pays half the cost of the damage for which he is responsible, i.e., one-quarter of the total. <b>And that</b> opinion stated by Abaye is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan</b> that each party in turn is responsible for all the damage. Consequently, since the non-sacred ox is innocuous, its owner pays half the total amount.
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead that there is no dispute, and that both <b>this</b> one, Abaye, <b>and that</b> one, Ravina, state their opinions <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. This</b> one, Ravina, is referring <b>to</b> where the non-sacred ox is <b>innocuous,</b> and so its owner pays half of a half, and <b>that</b> one, Abaye, is referring <b>to</b> where the non-sacred ox is <b>forewarned,</b> so its owner pays his entire share, i.e., half the total damage.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that there was another version of this dispute: <b>Abaye says</b> that he pays <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage,</b> and <b>Ravina says:</b> He pays <b>the full</b> cost of <b>the damage.</b> The Gemara explains their reasoning: Both <b>this</b> one and <b>that</b> one are referring <b>to</b> where the ox was <b>forewarned. This</b> one, Abaye, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> that each one is responsible for half the damage, and so he pays his share of half the total cost of the damage. <b>And that</b> one, Ravina, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan,</b> that each one is fully responsible for the damage, and when one perpetrator of the damage is exempt from payment, such as this case, the entire amount is collected from the other.
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead that there is no dispute, and that both <b>this</b> one <b>and that</b> one hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan. This</b> one, Ravina, is referring <b>to</b> where the ox was <b>forewarned</b> and the owner pays the full cost of the damage, <b>and that</b> one, Abaye, is referring <b>to</b> an <b>innocuous</b> ox, for which only half the cost of the damage is paid.
§ <b>Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>an ox and a person that push</b> a person or animal <b>into a pit,</b> then <b>concerning</b> the <b>damage</b> that they caused, <b>they,</b> i.e., the man who pushed the person or animal, the owner of the ox, and the owner of the pit, <b>are all liable</b> to pay the indemnity of damage. <b>Concerning the four</b> additional <b>types of indemnity,</b> which are loss of livelihood, pain, medical costs, and humiliation, <b>and</b> also with regard to the <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring,</b> the <b>person</b> who pushed is <b>liable, and</b> the owner of <b>the ox and</b> the owner of <b>the pit</b> are <b>exempt,</b> since the Torah did not impose any obligation on them to pay these payments.
<b>With regard to</b> the payment of <b>ransom</b> if it was a person who was pushed and killed, <b>and</b> also concerning the <b>thirty</b> shekels paid <b>for</b> a Canaanite <b>slave</b> who was killed, the owner of <b>the ox</b> is <b>liable,</b> and <b>the man</b> who did the pushing <b>and</b> the owner of <b>the pit</b> are <b>exempt. With regard to vessels</b> and <b>a disqualified consecrated ox</b> that fell into the pit, <b>the man</b> who did the pushing <b>and</b> the owner of the <b>ox</b> are <b>liable, and</b> the owner of the <b>pit</b> is <b>exempt.</b>
Rava explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that the owner of the pit is exempt from liability for damage caused to a disqualified consecrated ox? Since <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a pit: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:34), it teaches that the obligation to pay damages is imposed only <b>on the one to whom the carcass</b> subsequently <b>belongs,</b> thereby <b>excluding this</b> case of a disqualified consecrated ox, <b>where the carcass does not belong to him.</b> In this case, it is prohibited to sell the carcass. The owner of the pit cannot derive benefit from it, and it no longer belongs to anyone, so the conditions written in the verse are not in effect.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> this matter was <b>obvious to Rava? Is it not a dilemma</b> that was already raised <b>by Rava, as Rava asked: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a disqualified consecrated ox that fell into a pit?</b> Is <b>this</b> verse: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him,”</b> referring <b>to the one</b> to whom <b>the carcass belongs,</b> i.e., the owner of the pit, <b>excluding this</b> case <b>where the carcass does not belong to him,</b> and therefore the owner is exempt from paying for it? <b>Or perhaps</b> the verse <b>“And the carcass shall be for him” comes to teach that</b> the <b>owner</b> of the animal <b>attends to,</b> i.e., retains ownership of, <b>the carcass,</b> and the perpetrator of the damage pays him the difference?
The Gemara answers: Initially, Rava was in doubt about the matter, but <b>after</b> he <b>raised the dilemma,</b> he <b>then resolved it</b> and concluded that the verse imposes liability for the cost of damage only on a person to whom the carcass belongs, excluding the case of a disqualified consecrated ox.
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, from where does he</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>owner attends to the animal carcass?</b> The Gemara answers: He <b>derives it from</b> the verse: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:36), stated <b>with regard to Ox.</b> The Gemara asks further: <b>What did you see</b> to determine <b>that from</b> the verse <b>“And the carcass shall be for him,”</b> stated <b>with regard to Ox, you derive</b> from it the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the owner</b> of the dead ox <b>attends to the carcass,</b> and from the verse <b>“And the carcass belongs to him,”</b> stated <b>with regard to Pit, you derive from it</b> the <i>halakha</i> that only <b>the one to whom the carcass belongs</b> pays damages? Why can’t <b>I reverse</b> the derivations from each verse and say the opposite?
The Gemara answers: It <b>is reasonable</b> that the <b>exemption</b> applies to the verse stated <b>with regard to Pit, since</b> the Torah also <b>exempts</b> one from paying for damage classified as Pit caused to <b>vessels</b> that fall into it and break. The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>On the contrary,</b> one could claim that the <b>exemption</b> applies to the verse stated <b>with regard to Ox, since</b> the Torah also <b>exempted</b> the owner from <b>half</b> the cost of <b>the damage</b> in the case of an innocuous ox. The Gemara responds: <b>In any event, we do not find</b> that the owner of the ox is exempt from compensation for <b>the full</b> cost of <b>damage.</b> By contrast, with regard to Pit, there are certain items for which a person is not liable at all. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the Torah is more lenient in cases of Pit than of Ox.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>an ox and its accoutrements,</b> i.e., the vessels it was carrying, <b>fell into</b> the pit <b>and</b> the vessels <b>were broken,</b> or if a donkey and its accoutrements fell in and the accoutrements were torn, the owner of the pit is liable for damage to the animal caused by the pit, but he is exempt from liability for damage caused to the vessels, by Torah edict. The Gemara notes: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda obligates</b> a person to pay <b>for damage</b> caused <b>to vessels in</b> cases of <b>Pit.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reasoning of the Rabbis? Since the verse states: “And an ox or a donkey fall therein”</b> (Exodus 21:33), it is inferred that it is specifically <b>an ox, but not a person,</b> for whose death the owner of the pit is liable. Moreover, one is liable for <b>a donkey, but not vessels.</b> By contrast, <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> expounds the word <b>“or”</b> in the expression “an ox or a donkey” <b>to include vessels.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> explain the word “or”?

Daf 54a

The word <b>“or”</b> is <b>necessary to separate</b> the cases of the ox and donkey. This indicates that if either falls in individually, the owner of the pit is liable. <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>to separate</b> the cases in the verse? He derives it <b>from</b> the use of the singular form of the verb: <b>“And</b> an ox or donkey <b>fall [<i>venafal</i>],”</b> indicating that he is liable if even one animal falls. <b>And the Rabbis</b> maintain that the term <b>and fall</b> can also <b>indicate many</b> animals, as the use of the singular form of a verb does not prove that the subject is necessarily singular.
The Gemara now challenges both opinions: <b>Say</b> that the term <b>“and fall”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> whereas the phrase <b>“an ox or a donkey”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> According to the principles of halakhic exegesis, when the Torah presents <b>a generalization and a detail, the generalization</b> includes <b>only what</b> is contained <b>in the detail.</b> Therefore, <b>an ox and a donkey</b> are <b>indeed</b> included, but <b>anything else</b> is <b>not</b> included.
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: The following verse: <b>“The owner of the pit shall pay”</b> (Exodus 21:34), means that <b>it then generalized</b> again. The verses are structured according to the principle of halakhic exegesis of: <b>A generalization, and a detail, and a generalization.</b> According to this principle, <b>you may deduce</b> that the verses are referring <b>only</b> to items that are <b>similar to the detail.</b> In this case, <b>just as the explicit detail</b> is referring to <b>animals, so too, all</b> items included in the generalization must be <b>animals.</b>
The Gemara now challenges this answer: <b>If</b> so, <b>just as the explicit detail,</b> i.e., the ox and donkey, is referring to <b>items whose carcass renders</b> a person ritually <b>impure by contact or by carrying, so too, all items,</b> i.e., all animals, <b>whose carcass renders</b> a person ritually <b>impure through contact or by carrying,</b> should be included in the <i>halakhot</i> of damage classified as Pit. <b>But birds,</b> whose carcasses do not render a person impure through contact or by carrying, would <b>not</b> be included.
The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the Merciful One write</b> only <b>one detail,</b> from which the exclusion of birds could be derived. The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> detail <b>should</b> the Torah <b>write? If</b> it <b>writes</b> only <b>an ox, I would say</b> that an item that <b>is sacrificed on the altar,</b> such as an ox, <b>indeed</b> renders the owner of the pit liable, whereas an item <b>that is not sacrificed on the altar</b> does <b>not</b> render him liable. <b>And if the Merciful One writes</b> only <b>a donkey, I would say:</b> Those animals whose <b>firstborn</b> is <b>sanctified,</b> such as a donkey, as described in the Torah (Exodus 13:13), do <b>indeed</b> render their owners liable, but animals whose <b>firstborn</b> is <b>not sanctified</b> do <b>not</b> render them liable. Therefore, the Torah states both an ox and a donkey.
The original difficulty therefore resurfaces: Why is the verse not expounded as a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, thereby excluding birds? <b>Rather,</b> the previous method of deriving liability for a pit must be rejected, and instead it should be derived as follows: The <b>verse states: “And the carcass shall be for him”</b> (Exodus 21:34), from which it may be inferred that <b>anything subject to death</b> is included.
The Gemara asks: If this is the basis for liability for a pit, then <b>both according to the Rabbis, who exclude vessels</b> from liability based on another verse, <b>and according to Rabbi Yehuda, who has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include <b>vessels,</b> one could ask: <b>Are vessels subject to death?</b> Clearly, vessels cannot be subject to death. Why, then, is a separate source necessary to derive their halakhic status? The Sages <b>said</b> in reply: Vessels may also be considered subject to death in the sense that <b>their shattering is</b> tantamount to <b>their death.</b>
The Gemara continues to challenge this explanation: <b>But according to Rav, who says:</b> With regard to <b>Pit, for which the Torah deems</b> a person <b>liable,</b> it is only <b>for</b> damage caused by <b>its</b> lethal <b>fumes, but not for</b> damage caused by <b>the impact</b> of the fall, the following question may be raised <b>both according to the Rabbis and according to Rabbi Yehuda: Are vessels capable</b> of being broken by the lethal <b>fumes,</b> such that a verse is necessary to exclude them? The Sages <b>said</b> in reply: There is such a case concerning <b>new</b> vessels, <b>which crack from the fumes.</b>
The Gemara asks further: But isn’t <b>this</b> verse: <b>“And the carcass shall be for him,” necessary for that which Rava</b> ruled, <b>as Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a disqualified consecrated ox that fell into a pit,</b> the owner of the pit is <b>exempt, as it is stated: “And the carcass shall be for him.”</b> It is referring <b>to</b> a person to <b>whom</b> the <b>carcass belongs,</b> thereby <b>excluding this</b> person, to <b>whom</b> the <b>carcass</b> does <b>not belong.</b> Once a <i>halakha</i> has already been derived from this verse, it cannot be used as the basis for deriving a second <i>halakha</i>.
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of liability for Pit must be derived from another source. The <b>verse states</b> concerning Pit: <b>“He shall recompense money to its owners”</b> (Exodus 21:34), thereby <b>including any</b> item <b>that has an owner</b> within the scope of liability. The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even vessels and people</b> should be included <b>as well,</b> which presents a difficulty for all opinions.
The Gemara answers: This is why <b>the verse states: “An ox,” but not a person; “a donkey,” but not vessels.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Yehuda, who amplifies</b> the scope of liability to include <b>vessels, granted</b> that the term <b>“an ox”</b> is necessary, as he <b>excludes people based on it,</b> for which he is not liable. <b>But</b> with regard to the term <b>“a donkey,” what</b> does he <b>exclude based on it?</b>
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The term <b>“donkey”</b> stated <b>with regard to Pit, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and</b> the term <b>“sheep”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:1), stated <b>with regard to a lost</b> item, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>everyone</b> (see <i>Bava Metzia</i> 27a) are <b>difficult.</b> There is no explanation for why they are stated.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>a <i>ḥeresh</i> ox</b> or <b>a <i>shoteh</i></b> ox <b>or a <i>katan</i></b> ox <b>fell into</b> the pit, the owner of the pit is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> is meant by the phrase: <b>A <i>ḥeresh</i> ox</b> or <b>a <i>shoteh</i></b> ox <b>or a <i>katan</i></b> ox? <b>If we say</b> that it means: <b>An ox belonging to a deaf-mute [<i>ḥeresh</i>], an ox belonging to an imbecile [<i>shoteh</i>],</b> or <b>an ox belonging to a minor [<i>katan</i>],</b> then it can be inferred that if it was <b>an ox</b> belonging to a halakhically <b>competent</b> adult, the owner of the pit would be <b>exempt.</b> What would be the reason for this exemption?
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> Instead, it should be interpreted as: <b>An ox that is</b> impaired by being <b>deaf,</b> or <b>an ox that is an imbecile,</b> or <b>an ox that is</b> very <b>young.</b>

Daf 54b

The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> can it be inferred that if <b>an ox that is of</b> standard <b>intelligence</b> fell into a pit, the owner of the pit would be <b>exempt?</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> The mishna <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> and should be understood as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state that if <b>an ox that is of</b> standard <b>intelligence</b> fell into a pit, <b>that</b> the pit’s owner is <b>liable. But</b> with regard to <b>an ox</b> that is <b>deaf, an imbecile, or</b> very <b>young, say</b> that it was not due to the pit alone that it fell in, but <b>its deafness caused it</b> to fall in or <b>its young age caused it</b> to fall in, <b>and</b> the owner of the pit <b>should be exempt.</b> Therefore, it <b>teaches us</b> that he is liable in these cases as well.
<b>Rav Aḥa said to Ravina: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a living being that is <b>mentally competent fell into</b> a pit, the owner is <b>exempt. What, is it not</b> referring to <b>an ox</b> that is <b>mentally competent?</b> Ravina <b>said to him: No,</b> it is referring to <b>a person.</b> Rav Aḥa challenges this response: <b>If that is so,</b> you should then infer that it <b>is</b> only for the injuries of a <b>person</b> who is <b>mentally competent that</b> he is <b>exempt, but</b> if one is <b>not mentally competent,</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> he would be <b>liable?</b> But the term <b>“an ox” is written</b> in the Torah as causing liability, <b>and not a person.</b>
Rava responded to Rav Aḥa: <b>Rather, what</b> does the term <b>mentally competent</b> mean? It is referring to <b>a species</b> that is <b>mentally competent,</b> and thereby includes all humans in the exemption from liability. Rav Aḥa <b>said to him: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>an ox</b> that was <b>mentally competent fell inside it,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that Rabbi Yirmeya’s explanation should be rejected, and the mishna is referring <b>specifically</b> to <b>an ox that is deaf, an ox that is an imbecile, and an ox that is</b> very <b>young,</b> for which he is liable; <b>but</b> for <b>an ox that is</b> of standard <b>intelligence,</b> he is <b>exempt. What is the reason?</b> The reason is <b>that</b> the ox <b>should have looked carefully</b> while <b>walking.</b> If it did not, it is responsible for its own injury. The Gemara notes: <b>That</b> idea <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to an <b>ox</b> that is <b>deaf, an imbecile, or</b> very <b>young, blind, or</b> that is <b>walking at night</b> and unable to see, if it <b>fell into</b> a pit, the pit’s owner is <b>liable.</b> But if the ox is of standard <b>intelligence</b> or is <b>walking during the day,</b> the pit’s owner is <b>exempt,</b> since normal behavior for oxen is that, ordinarily, they watch where they are going and avoid pits.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The <i>halakha</i> is the same <b>whether</b> concerning <b>an ox or whether</b> concerning <b>any</b> other <b>animal with regard to</b> liability for <b>falling</b> into <b>a pit, and with regard to</b> keeping its <b>distance</b> from <b>Mount Sinai</b> at the time of the receiving of the Torah, when it was forbidden for any animal to ascend the mountain, <b>and with regard to the payment of double</b> the principal by a thief, <b>and with regard to</b> the mitzva of <b>returning a lost item, and with regard to unloading</b> its burden, and <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>muzzling</b> it while threshing, and <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds, and with regard to</b> the prohibition against its working on <b>Shabbat.</b>
<b>And similarly, undomesticated animals and birds</b> are subject to the same <i>halakhot</i> <b>as</b> domesticated animals. <b>If so,</b> why <b>are</b> all of the above <i>halakhot</i> <b>stated</b> in the Torah only in reference to <b>an ox or a donkey? Rather,</b> the reason is <b>that the verse speaks of a common</b> scenario, from which the other cases may be derived.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains the sources for all of the <i>halakhot</i> enumerated in the mishna that apply to all animals. <b>With regard to falling</b> into <b>a pit,</b> it is <b>written: “He shall recompense money to its owners”</b> (Exodus 21:34), which means that <b>any</b> animal <b>that has owners</b> is included, <b>as we mentioned</b> (see 54a). <b>With regard to</b> the requirement that animals keep their <b>distance</b> from <b>Mount Sinai</b> before the giving of the Torah, this is derived from the verse: <b>“Whether it be animal or person, it shall not live”</b> (Exodus 19:13), <b>and an undomesticated animal [<i>ḥayya</i>] is</b> also <b>included in</b> the term <b>animal [<i>behema</i>].</b> In addition, the word <b>“whether”</b> serves <b>to include birds.</b>
<b>With regard to the double payment</b> of a thief, it is <b>as we say</b> in a halakhic exegesis of the verse: <b>“For any matter of trespass”</b> (Exodus 22:8), that it is a general statement which <b>includes any matter</b> of <b>negligence. With regard to</b> the mitzva of <b>returning a lost item,</b> the verse states comprehensively: <b>“For every lost thing of your brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3). <b>With regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>unloading</b> a burden, <b>derive</b> it <b>from</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the context of <b>Shabbat,</b> as the word <b>donkey</b> is employed in the context of unloading a burden (see Exodus 23:5), and the word <b>donkey</b> is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Deuteronomy 5:14), and that verse is clearly referring to any animal.
<b>With regard to</b> the prohibition against <b>muzzling</b> an animal, mentioned in the verse: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it is threshing” (Deuteronomy 25:4), <b>derive</b> it <b>from</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the context of <b>Shabbat,</b> as the word <b>“ox”</b> is employed in the context of muzzling, and the word <b>“ox”</b> is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Deuteronomy 5:14), and that verse is clearly referring to any animal.
<b>With regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds, if</b> it is referring to the prohibition against using <b>diverse kinds for plowing,</b> due to which it is forbidden to plow with an ox and a donkey together (see Deuteronomy 22:10), <b>derive</b> it <b>from</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the context of <b>Shabbat,</b> as the word <b>“ox”</b> is employed in the context of plowing with diverse kinds, and the word <b>“ox”</b> is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Deuteronomy 5:14), and that verse is clearly referring to any animal.
<b>If</b> it is referring to the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds for crossbreeding, derive</b> it <b>from</b> a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the context of <b>Shabbat,</b> as the term <b>“your cattle”</b> is employed in the context of crossbreeding animals (see Leviticus 19:19), and the term <b>“your cattle”</b> is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Exodus 20:10), and that verse is clearly referring to any animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>concerning Shabbat</b> itself that the words “ox” and “donkey” are referring to all types of animals? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: In the first</b> version of the Ten <b>Commandments</b> it <b>is stated: “Your manservant, your maidservant, nor your cattle”</b> (Exodus 20:10), whereas <b>in the second</b> version of the Ten <b>Commandments</b> it <b>is stated: “Nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:14). Now, <b>aren’t an ox and a donkey</b> already <b>included in</b> the category of: <b>All animals,</b> which are included in the term “cattle”? <b>Why,</b> then, were they <b>specified? To teach you</b> that <b>just as</b> with regard to the terms <b>ox and donkey that are stated here, undomesticated animals and birds</b> have the same <i>halakha</i> <b>as them, so too,</b> everywhere that an ox and donkey are mentioned, <b>all</b> types of <b>undomesticated animals and birds</b> have the same <i>halakha</i> <b>as them.</b>
The Gemara asks: But why not <b>say</b> that the verses be expounded as follows: The term <b>“cattle”</b> used <b>in the first</b> version of the Ten <b>Commandments</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> and the phrase <b>“your ox and your donkey”</b> used <b>in the latter</b> version of the Ten <b>Commandments</b> is <b>a detail.</b> In the case of <b>a generalization and a detail,</b> the principles of halakhic exegesis dictate that <b>the generalization includes only what</b> is specified <b>in the detail.</b> Therefore, with regard to this subject, <b>an ox and a donkey</b> should <b>indeed</b> be included, but <b>anything else</b> should <b>not</b> be included.
The Sages <b>said</b> in reply: In the phrase <b>“nor any of your cattle”</b> stated <b>in the latter</b> version of the Ten <b>Commandments</b> following the phrase “your ox and your donkey,” <b>it then generalized</b> again. Therefore, the verse is structured as <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization.</b> According to the principles of halakhic exegesis, <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail.</b> Consequently, <b>just as</b> the items mentioned in <b>the detail</b> are clearly <b>defined as animals, so too, all</b> items included in the general term must be <b>animals.</b>
The Gemara challenges the answer: <b>But say</b> instead that <b>just as</b> the items mentioned in <b>the detail</b> are clearly <b>defined as an item,</b> i.e., an animal, <b>whose carcass renders</b> a person ritually <b>impure through contact or through carrying, so too, all items whose carcass renders</b> a person ritually <b>impure through contact or through carrying</b> should be included. <b>But birds,</b> whose carcasses do not render one impure through contact or through carrying, should <b>not</b> be included.
The Sages <b>said</b> in reply: <b>If so, let the Merciful One write</b> only <b>one detail</b> from which this could be derived. The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> detail <b>should</b> the <b>Merciful One write? If the Merciful One writes</b> only <b>an ox, I would say:</b> An animal that <b>is sacrificed on the altar,</b> such as an ox, <b>indeed</b> renders the owner of the pit liable, whereas an animal <b>that is not sacrificed on the altar</b> does <b>not</b> render him liable. <b>And if the Merciful One writes</b> only <b>a donkey, I would say:</b> An animal whose <b>firstborn</b> is <b>sanctified,</b> such as a donkey, as described in the Torah (Exodus 13:13), does <b>indeed</b> render him liable, but an animal whose <b>firstborn</b> is <b>not sanctified</b> does <b>not</b> render him liable. Therefore, <b>the Merciful One writes</b> both <b>an ox</b> and a donkey.
Consequently, there is no redundancy, and each detail is required for correctly deriving other <i>halakhot</i>. If so, the previous question resurfaces: Why are the verses not expounded such that the prohibition does not include birds? <b>Rather,</b> the term: <b>“Nor any [<i>vekhol</i>] of your cattle,”</b> should be understood as <b>an amplification,</b> encompassing any item that is even partially similar to the detail.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is it the case that <b>anywhere that the Merciful One states</b> the word <b>“any [<i>kol</i>]”</b> it <b>is</b> intended as an <b>amplification? But concerning tithes, where it is written “any [<i>kol</i>],” and</b> yet <b>we expound</b> the verses <b>with</b> the method of <b>a generalization and a detail,</b> rather than using the method of amplification and restriction.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning second-tithe money brought to Jerusalem: The verse states: <b>“And you shall give the money for anything [<i>bekhol</i>] your soul desires”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:26), which is <b>a generalization,</b> followed by: <b>“For oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink,”</b> which is <b>a detail,</b> and concludes with: <b>“Or for anything [<i>uvkhol</i>] your soul asks of you,”</b> where <b>it then generalized</b> again.
Therefore, the verse is structured as <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization.</b> According to the principles of halakhic exegesis, <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail.</b> Consequently, <b>just as</b> the items mentioned in <b>the detail</b> are clearly <b>defined as produce of produce,</b> i.e., they grow from a parent organism, such as agricultural produce or animals, <b>and</b> they are <b>grown from the ground,</b> i.e., their sustenance comes from the ground, <b>so too,</b> it includes <b>all</b> things that are <b>the produce of produce and are grown from the ground.</b> It is evident from here that the method of a generalization and a detail is used in connection with the term “kol,” as opposed to interpreting it as an amplification.
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: A distinction may be drawn between the term: <b>“For anything [<i>bekhol</i>],”</b> which is <b>a generalization,</b> and the term <b>“any [<i>kol</i>],”</b> as in: “Any of your cattle,” which is <b>an amplification.</b> And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead that the word <b>“any [<i>kol</i>]” is a generalization as well,</b> in addition to “for anything [<i>bekhol</i>].” <b>But this</b> word <b>“any,”</b> written <b>here, is an amplification.</b> This is the case <b>since it could have written: And your cattle, as it is written in</b> the <b>first</b> version of the Ten <b>Commandments, and</b> instead <b>it writes: “Nor any of your cattle.” Learn from</b> this that it is <b>an amplification</b> and encompasses other animals as well.
The Gemara continues to analyze this matter: <b>Now that you</b> have <b>said</b> that the term <b>“any [<i>kol</i>]” is an amplification, why do I</b> need the words <b>“your cattle,”</b> stated <b>in the first</b> version of the Ten <b>Commandments, and</b> the terms <b>“an ox or a donkey,”</b> stated <b>in the latter</b> version of the Ten <b>Commandments?</b> The phrase “and any of your cattle” already includes any animal.
The Sages <b>said</b> in response: Each of these terms is required. The term <b>“ox”</b> can be used <b>to derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition against <b>muzzling,</b> as the word <b>“ox”</b> is employed in the context of muzzling, and the word <b>“ox”</b> is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat.
The term <b>“donkey”</b> can be used <b>to derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>unloading</b> a burden, as the word <b>“donkey”</b> is employed in the context of unloading a burden (see Exodus 23:5), and the word <b>“donkey”</b> is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Deuteronomy 5:14).
The term <b>“your cattle”</b> can be used <b>to derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds,</b> as the term <b>“your cattle”</b> is employed in the context of crossbreeding animals (see Leviticus 19:19), and the term <b>“your cattle”</b> is employed in the context of the prohibition against having one’s animal perform labor on Shabbat (see Exodus 20:10).
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that this redundancy is the source for extending the prohibition of diverse kinds, then it <b>should be prohibited even</b> for <b>a person</b> to plow together with an ox or another animal. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>did we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 8:6): It is <b>permitted</b> for <b>a person to plow and pull with any of them,</b> indicating that the prohibition relates only to animals?
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The Sages of <b>Paphunya know the reason for this matter, and who</b> are these Sages? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov,</b> who resided in Paphunya. The reason is that the <b>verse states:</b> “You shall not perform any labor, neither you, your son, your daughter, your slave, your maidservant, your ox, your donkey, any of your animals, or the stranger residing within your city gates, <b>that your manservant and your maidservant may rest as well as you”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:14), as if to say: <b>I have equated</b> people with animals only <b>concerning resting</b> on Shabbat, <b>but not with regard to another matter.</b>
Having discussed some differences between the two versions of the Ten Commandments, the Gemara now discuses a related matter: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Agil asked Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: For what reason is</b> the word <b>good not stated in the first</b> version of the Ten <b>Commandments,</b> whereas <b>in the latter</b> version of the Ten <b>Commandments,</b>

Daf 55a

in the context of the mitzva to honor one’s parents, the word <b>good is stated there:</b> “In order that it shall be good for you” (Deuteronomy 5:16)? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to him: Before you ask me why</b> the word <b>good is stated, ask me if</b> the word <b>good is</b> actually <b>stated there or not, since</b> I am not sufficiently proficient in my knowledge of the biblical verses to remember the precise wording, and <b>I do not know if</b> the word <b>good is stated there or not. Go to Rabbi Tanḥum bar Ḥanilai, who was</b> commonly <b>found at</b> the academy of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, who was an expert in <i>aggada</i>.</b> Perhaps he heard something from him on this matter and can answer your question.
Rabbi Ḥanina ben Agil <b>went to him</b> and asked him. Rabbi Tanḥum <b>said to him: I did not hear</b> anything on this matter <b>from</b> Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi <b>himself. But this</b> is what <b>Shmuel bar Naḥum, the brother of the mother of Rav Aḥa, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said to me, and some say</b> it was <b>the father of the mother of Rav Aḥai, son of Rabbi Ḥanina:</b> It does not mention the word good in the first tablets, <b>since they</b> were <b>ultimately</b> destined <b>to be broken</b> after the Jews made the Golden Calf.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> even <b>if</b> it had mentioned the term good, and <b>they were ultimately</b> destined <b>to break, what of it? Rav Ashi said:</b> If this term had been mentioned in the first tablets, all <b>good</b> would have, <b>God forbid, ceased from Israel</b> once they were broken. Therefore, only the second version, which was written after the breaking of the tablets, contains the word good, so that there would always be good for the Jewish people.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> If <b>one sees</b> the letter <b><i>tet</i> in his dream,</b> it is <b>a good sign for him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason? If we say</b> that it is <b>because</b> the word <b>good [<i>tov</i>] is written</b> in the Torah and begins with the letter <i>tet</i>, then one could <b>say</b> instead that it is an allusion to the verse: <b>“And I will sweep it with the broom [<i>vetetetiha bemate’ateh</i>] of destruction”</b> (Isaiah 14:23), which also contains the letter <i>tet</i> several times but is referring to punishment. The Gemara answers: <b>We mean</b> that when someone sees <b>one <i>tet</i></b> in his dream, it is a good sign, but this latter verse contains several.
The Gemara asks: This latter statement is problematic, as even according to this explanation, one can <b>say</b> that a single letter <i>tet</i> alludes to the verse: <b>“Her filthiness [<i>tumatah</i>] is in her skirts”</b> (Lamentations 1:9), which begins with the letter <i>tet</i>. The Gemara answers: <b>We mean</b> that when one sees the letter <b><i>tet</i></b> together with the letter <b><i>bet</i></b> in his dream, it is a good sign for him, as the word <i>tov</i> is written with both. The Gemara asks further: According to this, <b>say</b> that it alludes to the verse: <b>“Her gates are sunk [<i>tave’u</i>] into the ground”</b> (Lamentations 2:9), which begins with the letter <i>tet</i> followed by the letter <i>bet</i>.
<b>Rather,</b> it is not merely because it is the first letter of the word good [<i>tov</i>] that it is considered a good omen. <b>Since the Torah initially introduces</b> the letter <i>tet</i> in a context <b>of good,</b> with the word good [<i>tov</i>] itself, it is a good omen. <b>As from</b> the word <b><i>bereshit</i>,</b> the first word in the Torah, <b>until</b> the verse: <b>“And God saw that the light</b> was good [<i>tov</i>]” (Genesis 1:4), the letter <b><i>tet</i> is not written</b> anywhere.
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> If <b>one sees a eulogy [<i>hesped</i>] in his dream,</b> it is an allusion that <b>in Heaven they had pity [<i>ḥasu</i>] on him and saved him [<i>peda’uhu</i>]</b> from actually being eulogized. The Gemara notes: <b>This statement</b> applies specifically when he actually saw the word: Eulogy [<i>hesped</i>], <b>in writing.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And similarly, undomesticated animals and birds</b> are subject to the same <i>halakhot</i> <b>as</b> domesticated animals. <b>Reish Lakish says: Here Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>taught</b> a ruling from the <i>Tosefta</i> that illustrates the statement that birds and undomesticated animals are also subject to the prohibition of diverse kinds: <b>A cock, a peacock [<i>tavvas</i>], and a pheasant [<i>ufasyonei</i>]</b> are <b>diverse kinds with</b> respect to <b>each other,</b> since this <i>halakha</i> applies to birds as well.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious;</b> what novelty is stated here? <b>Rav Ḥaviva said:</b> The novelty here is <b>because</b> they are <b>reared together. Lest you say:</b> Since they are reared together, they <b>are</b> essentially <b>one species,</b> and not considered diverse kinds. Therefore, it <b>teaches us</b> that they are actually separate species, and the <i>halakhot</i> of diverse kinds do apply to them.
Following the discussion of the prohibition of diverse kinds as it relates to birds, <b>Shmuel says:</b> The domestic <b>goose and</b> the <b>wild goose</b> are <b>diverse kinds</b> with respect <b>to each other</b> and are not one species. <b>Rava bar Rav Ḥanan objects to this: What is the reason? If we say</b> it is <b>because the beak of this one</b> is <b>long and the beak of that one</b> is <b>short, if that is so,</b> then with regard to <b>a Persian camel and an Arabian camel, where the neck of this one</b> is <b>thick and the neck of that one</b> is <b>thin,</b> they <b>should indeed be</b> considered <b>diverse kinds</b> with respect <b>to one another.</b> Clearly, though, the camels are in fact two variants of a single species.
<b>Rather, Abaye says:</b> That is not the reason, but rather another difference exists between the domestic goose and the wild goose, concerning the male: With regard to <b>this</b> type, i.e., the wild goose, <b>its testicles</b> are visible <b>from the outside, and</b> with regard to <b>that</b> one, i.e., the domestic goose, <b>its testicles are inside. Rav Pappa said</b> that another difference exists between them, concerning the female: <b>This</b> one, i.e., the wild goose, <b>releases</b> only <b>one egg in</b> its <b>ovary</b> and later releases another, <b>and that</b> one, i.e., the domestic goose, <b>releases several eggs</b> at once <b>in</b> its <b>ovary.</b> Consequently, they are not considered to be the same species.
In connection with the prohibition of diverse kinds, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> One <b>who crossbreeds two species</b> of creatures <b>that</b> live <b>in the sea is flogged</b> for transgressing the prohibition of crossbreeding diverse kinds. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason,</b> i.e., where is there an allusion to this in the Torah? <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said in the name of Ulla:</b> It <b>is derived</b> from a verbal analogy between the term: <b>“According to its species [<i>leminehu</i>]”</b> (Genesis 1:21), referring to animals living <b>on dry land,</b> and the same term: <b>“According to its species [<i>leminehu</i>]”</b> (Genesis 1:25), referring to sea creatures. In the same way that the former may not be crossbred, similarly, the latter may not be crossbred.
The Sage <b>Raḥava raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to one <b>who drives</b> a wagon on the seashore <b>with a goat and a <i>shibbuta</i>,</b> a certain species of fish, together, pulled by the goat on land and the fish at sea, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Has he violated the prohibition against performing labor with diverse kinds, in the same way that one does when plowing with an ox and a donkey together, or not? The two sides of the question are as follows: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since the goat does not descend into the sea and the <i>shibbuta</i> does not ascend onto the land,</b> they are not working together at all, and so he <b>has not done anything</b> forbidden? <b>Or perhaps,</b> since <b>in any event,</b> he is <b>now driving</b> the wagon with both of them, he thereby transgresses the prohibition?
<b>Ravina objects to this: But if that is so</b> that one is liable, then if a person <b>joined wheat and barley</b> together <b>in his hand and sowed the wheat in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and the barley outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, where the prohibition of diverse kinds does not apply to seeds, <b>so too</b> he <b>should be liable.</b> Clearly, however, they are two distinct regions, and the seeds are not considered to be mixed together.
The Sages <b>said</b> in response to this objection: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of planting diverse kinds of seeds, it is specifically <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael that is <b>the location</b> subject to this <b>obligation,</b> whereas <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael is <b>not a location</b> subject to this <b>obligation. Here,</b> by contrast, in the case of the person driving a wagon, both <b>this</b> location, i.e., the land, <b>and that</b> location, i.e., the sea, are <b>locations</b> subject to this <b>obligation.</b> Consequently, if one works together two different species either on the land or in the sea, he is liable. Therefore, the question is a valid one.

Daf 55b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who brought</b> his flock of <b>sheep into the pen and locked</b> the door <b>before it</b> in a manner that is <b>appropriate, and</b> despite this sheep <b>went out and caused damage</b> in another person’s field by eating produce or trampling it, the owner is <b>exempt,</b> since he safeguarded the animals appropriately. If <b>he did not lock</b> the door <b>before</b> the sheep in a manner that is <b>appropriate, and</b> sheep <b>went out and caused damage,</b> the owner is <b>liable,</b> since his negligence led to the damage.
If the owner locked the door appropriately but the wall of the pen <b>was breached at night, or bandits breached it, and</b> sheep subsequently <b>went out and caused damage</b> by eating or trampling, the owner of the sheep is <b>exempt</b> from liability. If the <b>bandits</b> themselves <b>took</b> the sheep <b>out</b> of the pen and the animals subsequently caused damage, the <b>bandits</b> are <b>liable.</b>
If the owner <b>left</b> the animal <b>in the sun,</b> causing it to suffer, <b>or</b> if <b>he conveyed it to a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor,</b> who are not able to safeguard it, <b>and</b> the animal <b>went out and caused damage,</b> the owner is <b>liable</b> because he was negligent.
If the owner <b>conveyed</b> the animal <b>to a shepherd</b> to care for it, <b>the shepherd enters in his place</b> and is responsible for the damage.
If the animal <b>fell into a garden and derives benefit</b> from produce there, its owner <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> it <b>derives</b> and not for other damage caused. If the animal <b>descended</b> into the garden <b>in its usual manner and caused damage</b> there, its owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what it damaged. How does</b> the court appraise the value of the damage when the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what it damaged?</b> The court <b>appraises</b> a large piece of land with <b>an area required for</b> sowing <b>one <i>se’a</i> of seed [<i>beit se’a</i>] in that field,</b> including the garden bed in which the damage took place. This appraisal includes <b>how much it was worth</b> before the animal damaged it <b>and how much is it worth</b> now, and the owner must pay the difference. The court appraises not only the garden bed that was eaten or trampled, rather the depreciation in value of the bed as part of the surrounding area. This results in a smaller payment, as the damage appears less significant in the context of a larger area.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> This principle of appraisal applies only in a case where the animal ate unripe produce; but if <b>it ate ripe produce,</b> the owner <b>pays</b> the value of the <b>ripe produce.</b> Therefore, <b>if</b> it ate <b>one <i>se’a</i></b> of produce, he pays for <b>one <i>se’a</i>,</b> and <b>if</b> it ate <b>two <i>se’a</i>,</b> he pays for <b>two <i>se’a</i>.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies the definition of locking the door in a manner that is appropriate. <b>The Sages taught: What is</b> considered locking in a manner that is <b>appropriate, and what is</b> considered locking in a manner that is <b>not appropriate?</b> If one locked the <b>door</b> such <b>that it is able to withstand a typical wind</b> without collapsing or opening, <b>this is</b> considered a manner that is <b>appropriate,</b> whereas if he locked the door such <b>that it is unable to withstand a typical wind, this is</b> considered a manner that is <b>not appropriate.</b>
<b>Rabbi Mani bar Patish said: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> with regard to animals that are <b>forewarned that it is sufficient</b> for the owner to provide only <b>reduced safeguarding?</b> Since the mishna deals with damage categorized as Eating or Trampling, for which all animals are considered forewarned, <b>it</b> must be in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as we learned</b> in a mishna (45b): If <b>the owner</b> of an ox <b>tied it with reins</b> to a fence <b>or locked</b> the gate <b>before it</b> in a manner that is <b>appropriate, but</b> nevertheless the ox <b>went out and caused damage, whether</b> the animal is <b>innocuous or forewarned</b> the owner is <b>liable</b> because this is not considered sufficient precaution to prevent damage; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that if the ox is <b>innocuous</b> the owner is <b>liable</b> even if he safeguarded it appropriately, since the Torah does not limit the required safeguarding for an innocuous animal. But if the ox is <b>forewarned,</b> the owner is <b>exempt</b> from payment of damages, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse describing the liability for damage caused by a forewarned animal: <b>“And the owner has not secured it”</b> (Exodus 21:36), <b>and this</b> ox that was tied with reins or behind a locked gate <b>was secured. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> A forewarned ox <b>has no</b> sufficient <b>safeguarding</b> at all <b>other than</b> slaughtering it with <b>a knife.</b> According to this mishna, only Rabbi Yehuda maintains that reduced safeguarding is sufficient to render exempt from liability the owner of an ox that is forewarned.
The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that the owner of a forewarned ox is liable even if he provides only reduced safeguarding. Although animals are considered forewarned with regard to Eating and Trampling, one cannot apply to them a <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to an animal that is forewarned with regard to Goring. The <i>halakha</i> <b>is different</b> with regard to <b>Eating and Trampling since the Torah limited</b> the required standard of <b>safeguarding for them. As</b> the <i>amora</i> <b>Rabbi Elazar says, and some say it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> There are <b>four matters</b> for which <b>the Torah limited their</b> required standard of <b>safeguarding, and these are: Pit, and Fire, Eating, and Trampling.</b>
Where does the Torah limit the required standard of safeguarding with regard to the category of <b>Pit? As it is written: “If a man shall open a pit, or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it,</b> and an ox or a donkey fall therein, the owner of the pit shall pay” (Exodus 21:33). One can infer: <b>But</b> if <b>he covered it,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability, even though it is possible that the pit would become uncovered in the future.
Where does the Torah limit the required standard of safeguarding with regard to the category of <b>Fire? As it is written: “The one who kindled the fire shall pay compensation”</b> (Exodus 22:5), which is interpreted to mean that one is exempt from liability <b>unless he acts</b> in a manner that is <b>similar</b> to actively <b>kindling</b> the fire in another’s property by being negligent.
Where does the Torah limit the required standard of safeguarding with regard to the category of <b>Eating? As it is written:</b> “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and he set his animal loose, <b>and it feed [<i>uvi’er</i>] in the field of another”</b> (Exodus 22:4). This indicates that the owner does not bear liability <b>unless he acts</b> in a manner that is <b>similar</b> to causing his animal to <b>feed</b> there, by being negligent.
Where does the Torah limit the required standard of safeguarding with regard to the category of <b>Trampling? As it is written:</b> “If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, <b>and he set</b> his animal <b>loose [<i>veshilaḥ</i>],</b> and it feed in the field of another” (Exodus 22:4). This indicates that the owner is not liable <b>unless he acts</b> in a manner that is <b>similar</b> to <b>setting</b> his animal <b>loose.</b>
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the term <b><i>veshilaḥ</i>: This</b> is referring to damage by <b>Trampling, and similarly,</b> the verse <b>states: “That send forth [<i>meshaleḥei</i>] the feet of the ox and the donkey”</b> (Isaiah 32:20). With regard to the term <b><i>uvi’er</i>: This</b> is referring to damage by <b>Eating, and similarly,</b> the verse <b>states: “As one consumes with the tooth, until it be all gone”</b> (I Kings 14:10).
Evidently, <b>the reason</b> for the owner’s liability is specifically <b>that he acted</b> in a manner that is <b>similar to</b> setting the animal <b>loose</b> or causing it <b>to feed.</b> One can infer: <b>But</b> if <b>he did not act</b> in such a manner, even if he provided only reduced safeguarding, he is <b>not</b> liable.
<b>Rabba said:</b> The wording of <b>the mishna is also precise, as it taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> specifically with regard to <b>sheep.</b> This raises the question: <b>Since we have been dealing with</b> cases involving <b>an ox</b> in all the previous <i>mishnayot</i>, then <b>let</b> this mishna also <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>an ox. What is different</b> in this mishna <b>that it teaches</b> the case of <b>sheep? Is it not because the Torah limited</b> its requirements specifically with regard to <b>the safeguarding</b> against damage that is more likely to be caused by sheep, i.e., caused by Eating and Trampling, since sheep are unlikely to gore? If so, the wording of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir, who holds that a reduced level of supervision is sufficient only with regard to Eating and Trampling, but not Goring.
The Gemara rejects this: One can <b>not</b> necessarily derive from the wording of the mishna that it is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir. Perhaps the mishna specifically uses the case of sheep to teach the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, <b>because</b> if it would have used an example of an ox <b>here,</b> one might have thought that it also includes damage caused by <b>Goring,</b> about which it <b>is not written</b> in the Torah that reduced supervision is sufficient. Therefore, the mishna specifically uses the example of sheep, to indicate damage caused by <b>Eating and Trampling,</b> about <b>which it is written</b> that reduced supervision is sufficient. And <b>it teaches us that</b> only with regard to <b>Eating and Trampling, for</b> which animals <b>are</b> considered <b>forewarned</b> from the outset, is reduced supervision sufficient according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. The Gemara concludes that this is a valid reading of the mishna and one may <b>learn from</b> it that the mishna may even be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda.
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua said:</b> There are <b>four matters</b> in which one <b>who commits</b> an offense concerning <b>them</b> is <b>exempt</b> from liability <b>according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven</b> and it would be proper for him to pay compensation, <b>and the</b> cases <b>are</b> as follows: <b>One who breaches a fence</b> that stood <b>before another’s animal,</b> thereby allowing the animal to escape; <b>and one who bends another’s standing</b> grain <b>before a fire</b> so that it catches fire; <b>and one who hires false witnesses to testify; and one who knows testimony</b> in support <b>of another but does not testify on his behalf.</b>
The Gemara clarifies each of the cases listed in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master says:</b> With regard to the case of <b>one who breaches a fence</b> that stood <b>before another’s animal, what are the circumstances? If we say</b> it is speaking <b>of a stable wall</b> that would not have fallen by itself, the one who breached it <b>should also be liable according to human laws,</b> at least for the damage caused to the wall. <b>Rather,</b> here

Daf 56a

the <i>baraita</i> is speaking <b>of an unstable wall</b> that was about to fall and break in any event, and so his action did not actually cause any loss to the owner.
<b>The Master says:</b> With regard to the case mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> of <b>one who bends another’s standing</b> grain <b>before a fire, what are the circumstances? If we say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the fire would <b>reach</b> the bent grain <b>in a typical wind, let him</b> also <b>be liable</b> for the damage according to <b>human laws. Rather,</b> it must be a case <b>where</b> the fire could <b>reach</b> the bent grain only <b>in an atypical wind.</b> Therefore, he is exempt according to human laws, and, since the grain was destroyed due to his action, he is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
<b>And Rav Ashi</b> offered an alternative explanation and <b>said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>was stated</b> in the case of <b>a concealed</b> item; in other words, this person did not bend the grain toward the fire but bent it over another item in order to conceal it. One is not liable to pay restitution for concealed items damaged by fire. Therefore, when this person bent the grain over an item, he caused indirect damage to the owner of that item <b>because he made it into a concealed</b> item that was subsequently damaged by <b>fire,</b> and the owner cannot reclaim his loss.
<b>The Master says:</b> With regard to the case mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> of <b>one who hires false witnesses, what are the circumstances? If we say</b> that he hired them <b>for his own</b> benefit, in order to extract payment from another, <b>he is required to reimburse</b> that person with <b>money, and he is liable according to human laws</b> for receiving money under false circumstances. <b>Rather,</b> the case is one where he hired false witnesses <b>for</b> the benefit of <b>another.</b> In such a case the injured party cannot sue the other litigant, since the latter did not hire the witnesses, nor can he sue the person who hired them, since that person received no personal benefit.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And one who knows testimony in support of another but does not testify on his behalf</b> is exempt from liability according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. <b>With what</b> circumstances <b>are we dealing? If we say</b> that the case <b>involves two</b> people who could testify, and their evidence would render the other party liable to pay, it <b>is obvious</b> that each of them is liable according to the laws of Heaven; he has committed a transgression <b>by Torah law: “If he does not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity”</b> (Leviticus 5:1). Therefore, it is unnecessary for the <i>baraita</i> to mention this case.
<b>Rather,</b> the case of the <i>baraita</i> <b>concerns a single</b> witness, whose testimony is not sufficient to render another liable, and to which the transgression of Torah law consequently does not apply. Nevertheless, a litigant can be forced to take an oath based on the testimony of a single witness, and refusal to take this oath would obligate the litigant to pay. Therefore, the witness has caused an indirect loss and is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is there nothing else,</b> i.e., is there no other case in which one is exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven? <b>But there is</b> such a case. And before citing several cases that are not written in the <i>baraita</i> the Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> device: <b>One who performs; with poison; and an agent; another; is broken.</b> The Gemara returns to the first case: One <b>who performs labor with water of purification,</b> which was meant to be used to purify one rendered ritually impure by a corpse, thereby rendering the water unfit for use, <b>or</b> who performs labor <b>with the</b> red <b>heifer of purification,</b> invalidating the animal for use as an element of the purification ritual, is <b>exempt according to human laws,</b> since the damage he caused is not evident, <b>but liable according to the laws of Heaven,</b> as he caused a financial loss.
The Gemara adds: <b>But there is</b> the following <i>halakha</i>: With regard to <b>one who places poison before another’s animal,</b> and the animal eats it and dies, he is <b>exempt according to human laws,</b> since the animal caused its own death, <b>but liable according to the laws of Heaven.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>one who sends</b> an exposed <b>flame in the hand of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor,</b> and the fire spreads, causing damage; he is <b>exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>But there is</b> the case of <b>one who frightens another</b> without touching him, but causes him injury; he is <b>exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>But there is</b> the case of one <b>whose jug broke in the public domain and he did not remove</b> the broken pieces, or one <b>whose camel fell and he did not stand it up</b> again. <b>Rabbi Meir deems</b> the owner of jug or of the camel <b>liable</b> for the damage thereby caused to others, <b>and the Rabbis say that</b> he is <b>exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven.</b> Since there are so many other cases, why did Rabbi Yehoshua claim in the <i>baraita</i> that there are only four cases when one is exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven?
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, there are, in any event, many</b> other cases, <b>but</b> Rabbi Yehoshua held that it <b>was necessary for him</b> to state the <i>halakha</i> of <b>these</b> four cases. The reason he stated them is <b>lest you say</b> that in these cases <b>one should not be liable even according to the laws of Heaven.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua <b>teaches us</b> that in these cases one is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
The Gemara explains why one might have thought that there is no liability at all for each case in the <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Yehoshua taught that <b>one who breaches a fence</b> that stood <b>before another’s animal,</b> thereby allowing the animal to escape, is liable according to the laws of Heaven, <b>lest you say: Since</b> the fence <b>is about to collapse</b> even without this person’s intervention, <b>what did</b> he really <b>do?</b> Based on that logic, one might have thought that <b>he should not be liable even according to the laws of Heaven.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua <b>teaches us</b> that in such a case he is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
Rabbi Yehoshua taught that <b>one who bends another’s standing</b> grain is liable according to the laws of Heaven, <b>lest you say: Let</b> the one who bent the grain <b>say</b> to the owner: <b>Did I know that an atypical wind would come</b> and cause the fire to spread? Based on that logic, one might have thought that <b>he should not be liable even according to the laws of Heaven.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua <b>teaches us</b> that in such a case he is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
<b>And according to Rav Ashi, who said</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua’s ruling <b>was stated</b> with regard to the case of <b>a concealed</b> item, Rabbi Yehoshua mentioned liability according to the laws of Heaven <b>lest you say</b> that the one who concealed the item could say: <b>I covered it for you</b> in order to protect it from the fire. Based on that logic, one might have thought that <b>he should not be liable even according to the laws of Heaven.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua <b>teaches us</b> that in such a case he is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
<b>And</b> Rabbi Yehoshua taught that there is liability <b>also</b> in the case of <b>one who hires false witnesses, lest you say: Let</b> the one who hired them <b>say:</b> If the witnesses hear <b>the statement of the teacher,</b> i.e., God, Who prohibited giving false testimony, <b>and the statement of the student,</b> i.e., the one who hired them, <b>to whose statement</b> should they <b>listen?</b> Although the one who hired them encouraged these witnesses to sin, ultimately it was they who transgressed by not adhering to the instructions of God. <b>And</b> based on this logic one might have thought that <b>he should not be liable even according to the laws of Heaven.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua <b>teaches us</b> that in such a case he is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
Finally, Rabbi Yehoshua taught that <b>one who knows testimony</b> in support <b>of another but does not testify on his behalf</b> is liable according to the laws of Heaven, <b>lest you say</b> that the witness could claim: <b>Who says that had I come forward</b> and <b>testified on behalf of</b> one litigant, the other litigant <b>would admit</b> liability? <b>Perhaps he would have</b> chosen to <b>take a false oath</b> and absolve himself. Based on that logic one might have thought that <b>he should not be liable even according to the laws of Heaven.</b> Therefore, Rabbi Yehoshua <b>teaches us</b> that in such a case he is liable according to the laws of Heaven.
§ The mishna teaches: If the pen <b>was breached at night, or bandits breached it,</b> and sheep subsequently went out and caused damage, the owner of the sheep is exempt. <b>Rabba says: And this</b> first instance of a pen that was breached is referring specifically to a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>tunneled</b> under the wall of the pen and by doing so caused the wall to collapse. In that case, the owner is completely blameless and therefore exempt from liability for any damage that ensues.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the animal <b>did not tunnel</b> under the wall, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Would the owner be <b>liable? What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that the pen had <b>a stable wall,</b> then even <b>if</b> the animal <b>did not tunnel, why</b> is the owner <b>liable? What should he have done?</b> Clearly, he cannot be held liable for the damage. <b>Rather,</b> the pen had <b>an unstable wall.</b> The Gemara asks: Even <b>if</b> the animal <b>tunneled</b> under the wall and knocked it down, <b>why</b> is he <b>exempt?</b> The damage in this case is <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident.</b>
<b>This works out well according to the one who said</b> that in any case of damage that is <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability, since the ultimate cause of the damage was not his fault. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that in any case of damage that is <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident</b> he is <b>liable,</b> as even without the accident his negligence could have caused damage, <b>what is there to say?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the case of <b>the mishna concerns a stable wall, and even</b> if the animal <b>did not tunnel</b> under the wall the owner is exempt. <b>And when</b> the statement <b>of Rabba was stated, it was stated with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna that says: If the owner <b>left</b> the animal <b>in the sun or conveyed it to a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, and</b> the animal <b>went out and caused damage,</b> the owner is <b>liable.</b> Concerning this <b>Rabba stated: And</b> the owner is liable <b>even if</b> the animal <b>tunneled</b> its way out under the wall of the pen.
The Gemara explains: <b>It is not necessary</b> for the mishna to mention the case <b>where the animal did not tunnel</b> its way out. In that case the owner is clearly liable, since <b>the entire</b> incident occurred due to his <b>negligence</b> of leaving the animal in the sun, thereby causing it distress and leading it to attempt escape by any possible means. <b>But even if</b> the animal <b>tunneled</b> its way out, the owner is liable, and this is the novelty in this ruling: <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>this is</b> a case of damage that is <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident,</b> because animals do not typically tunnel their way out of a pen, the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> it is considered as though <b>the entire</b> damage resulted from the owner’s <b>negligence.</b>
<b>What is the reason</b> that the owner is liable? It is <b>that</b> the one who suffered the damage <b>can say to</b> the owner of the sheep: <b>You should have known that since you left it in the sun, it would utilize any means [<i>tatzdeka</i>] available for it to use and</b> it would <b>escape,</b> so you are ultimately responsible for the damage.
§ The mishna teaches: If the <b>bandits</b> themselves <b>took</b> the sheep <b>out, the bandits are liable.</b>

Daf 56b

The Gemara questions the need for this ruling: <b>It</b> is <b>obvious</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>, as <b>once they removed</b> the animal, <b>it is</b> now <b>in their custody for all purposes,</b> including responsibility for any ensuing damage.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this statement is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where they stood before</b> the animal and encouraged it to leave the enclosure but did not lead it out directly. This case is <b>like</b> the case in <b>this</b> statement <b>that Rabba says</b> that <b>Rav Mattana says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>one who stands another’s animal near</b> a third <b>person’s standing</b> grain, and the animal eats the grain, he is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: If he <b>stands</b> the animal there, isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that he is liable? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this ruling is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> one <b>stood before the animal</b> and encouraged it to go toward the grain without leading it, and he is nevertheless liable.
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: You told us</b> when explaining the statement of Rav Mattana in the name of Rav that it is referring to a case where <b>he hit</b> the animal with a stick, <b>and</b> similarly, the mishna can <b>also</b> be explained as referring to a case <b>where</b> the <b>bandits hit it</b> with a stick and did not lead it.
§ The mishna teaches that if the owner <b>conveyed</b> the animal <b>to a shepherd</b> to care for it, <b>the shepherd enters</b> in his place and is responsible for all damage. The Sages <b>say</b> in clarification: The shepherd enters <b>in place of whom? If we say</b> that the shepherd is <b>in place of the owner of the animal,</b> didn’t <b>we</b> already <b>learn on one occasion</b> in a mishna (44b): If the owner <b>conveyed</b> his animal <b>to an unpaid bailee, or to a borrower, to a paid bailee, or to a renter, they all enter</b> into the responsibilities and liabilities <b>in place of the owner.</b> What novelty is there in stating that the responsibility now lies with the shepherd to whom the owner conveyed the animal? <b>Rather,</b> it means that the shepherd enters <b>in place of a bailee</b> to whom the owner conveyed the animal, who is no longer liable once he conveys the animal to a shepherd.
The Gemara asks: If so, this mishna indicates that <b>the first bailee exempts himself completely</b> by conveying the sheep to a shepherd, the second bailee, and he bears no further responsibility. <b>Shall we say that</b> mishna is <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the ruling of <b>Rava, as Rava says: A bailee who conveyed</b> the deposit <b>to</b> another <b>bailee</b> nevertheless remains <b>liable?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rava</b> could <b>say to you</b> in response: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean when it states: <b>He conveyed it to a shepherd?</b> It is referring to a shepherd who conveyed the animal <b>to</b> the shepherd’s <b>assistant, as it is</b> the typical <b>manner of a shepherd to convey</b> animals in his charge <b>to his assistant.</b> Therefore, anyone who gives his animal to a shepherd understands that the shepherd’s assistant may also care for the animal, and it is not a violation of the terms of his assignment for the shepherd to convey it to his assistant. Consequently, this mishna does not refute Rava’s opinion.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> the same answer in a similar manner: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the case using the expression: <b>He conveyed it to a shepherd, and does not teach</b> it using the less specific expression: <b>He conveyed it to another, conclude from it</b> that <b>what</b> it means by: <b>He conveyed it to a shepherd,</b> is that <b>the shepherd conveyed it to his assistant, as it is the</b> typical <b>manner of a shepherd to convey</b> an animal <b>to his assistant. But</b> if the shepherd conveyed it <b>to another</b> to care for it in his place, the mishna does <b>not</b> rule that the other person enters in his place.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the wording of the mishna therefore <b>supports Rava’s</b> opinion, <b>as Rava says: A bailee who conveyed</b> the deposit <b>to</b> another <b>bailee</b> remains <b>liable.</b> The Sages <b>say</b> in rejection of that suggestion: <b>No,</b> one cannot infer from the wording of the mishna that it is referring specifically to a shepherd conveying the animal to his assistant, since <b>perhaps it teaches the matter in the manner in which it</b> typically occurs, <b>but the same is true</b> even if the shepherd conveyed the animal <b>to another.</b> Therefore, no support can be brought from here for Rava’s opinion.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that there is a dispute between <i>amora’im</i> concerning the following issue: With regard to <b>one who is safeguarding a lost item</b> that he has not yet returned, what level of responsibility does he bear? <b>Rabba said:</b> He is considered to be <b>like an unpaid bailee,</b> whereas <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> He is considered to be <b>like a paid bailee.</b>
Their respective opinions are explained: <b>Rabba said</b> that he is considered to be <b>like an unpaid bailee</b> because <b>what benefit comes to him</b> through safeguarding it? Therefore, he is just like any unpaid bailee. <b>Rav Yosef said</b> that he is considered to be <b>like a paid bailee on account of the benefit that</b> he is <b>not required to give bread to a poor person</b> while looking after the lost item, since one who is engaged in one mitzva is exempt from performing another. Consequently, since there is some benefit involved in looking after the lost item, <b>he is</b> considered to be <b>like a paid bailee.</b>
This is one interpretation, whereas <b>there are</b> those <b>who explain like this: Rav Yosef said</b> that he is considered to be <b>like a paid bailee. Once the Merciful One obligates him against his will</b> to look after lost items, the Torah presumably imposes the high standard of safeguarding on him. Therefore, he is considered to be <b>like a paid bailee.</b>
The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the <i>halakhot</i> and difficulties to be discussed: <b>He returned it, always, returned, Ḥiyya, you say, breaks, payment.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba</b> from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 57a

If one found a lost item and <b>he returned it to a place where</b> its owner <b>will see it, he is no</b> longer <b>responsible to deal with it.</b> If the item <b>was stolen or lost,</b> the finder <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> to compensate for the loss.
Rav Yosef states his objection: <b>What is</b> meant <b>by</b> the expression: <b>Was stolen or lost?</b> Does it <b>not</b> mean that it <b>was stolen from</b> the finder’s <b>house or lost from his house</b> before he returned it? Since he is liable for theft or loss, it appears that he has the same status as a paid bailee.
Rabba rejects this challenge: <b>No,</b> it means that it was stolen or lost <b>from the place where</b> the finder <b>returned it,</b> in which case even an unpaid bailee is liable on the grounds of negligence.
Rav Yosef challenges Rabba’s response: <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that the finder <b>is no</b> longer <b>responsible to deal with it,</b> indicating that failing to deal with it is not negligence, and the finder has no further responsibility for it.
Rabba <b>said to him: With what are we dealing here,</b> at the end of the <i>baraita</i>, where it teaches that the finder is liable? We are dealing with a case <b>where he returned it at midday,</b> which is a time when the owner of the lost item is not typically present. Therefore, the finder has not returned the item properly, and if it is then stolen or lost, he bears responsibility even if he is an unpaid bailee.
<b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching two</b> separate <i>halakhot</i>, <b>and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> If the finder <b>returned it in the morning,</b> when people are typically present, <b>to a place where</b> the owner of the lost item <b>will see it, and</b> the owner <b>typically enters and exits and</b> it is likely that <b>he will see it,</b> the finder <b>is no</b> longer <b>responsible to deal with it,</b> nor does he bear responsibility if it is then stolen or lost. By contrast, if the finder <b>returned it at midday to a place where</b> the owner <b>will see it, since</b> it is a time when the owner <b>does not typically enter and exit and will not see it, if it is</b> then <b>stolen or lost</b> the finder <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> for the loss.
Rav Yosef again <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rabba from that which is taught in the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>: The finder of the lost item <b>always bears responsibility</b> if the item is stolen or lost <b>until he returns it to</b> the owner’s <b>property. What</b> does the word <b>always</b> add? <b>Is it not</b> teaching that <b>even</b> if the lost item was stolen <b>from</b> the finder’s <b>house,</b> he is liable? If so, <b>learn from</b> this that one who finds a lost item <b>is</b> considered <b>like a paid bailee.</b>
Rabba <b>said to</b> Rav Yosef in reply: <b>I concede to you in</b> a case of one looking after lost <b>animals</b> that he is liable if they are stolen or lost. The reason is <b>that since</b> the animals <b>have</b> already <b>taken</b> to the habit of <b>walking out</b> of their usual path and not behaving in their typical manner, <b>they require extra safeguarding,</b> corresponding to that required of a paid bailee. But with regard to other items that are lost, those that do not move by themselves, the finder bears no greater responsibility to secure them than does an unpaid bailee.
<b>Rabba raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef:</b> The verse states in the context of returning lost items: “Return them” (Deuteronomy 22:1), repeating the verb “<i>hashev teshivem</i>.” The Sages expounded as follows: From the word <b>“<i>hashev</i>” I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that one may return the item <b>to the house</b> of the owner of the lost article. <b>From where</b> do I derive that even if one returns it <b>to his garden or to his ruin,</b> i.e., an unused structure on his property, he has discharged his obligation and is no longer responsible for the item that he found? For this, <b>the verse states: “<i>Teshivem</i>,”</b> repeating the verb for emphasis, to teach that he fulfills the mitzva by returning the item <b>to any place</b> belonging to the owner.
<b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>To his garden or to his ruin? If we say</b> that the finder returned the lost item <b>to</b> the <b>garden</b> of the owner <b>that is secured,</b> i.e., properly enclosed, <b>or to his ruin that is secured,</b> it would be unnecessary to state this, as it <b>is</b> the same as <b>his house,</b> since these spaces are secured in the same way as his house. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that it means that he returned them <b>to his garden that is not secured, or to his ruin that is not secured,</b> and nevertheless, the finder is no longer liable for subsequent damage or theft of the found item. <b>Conclude from it</b> that a finder <b>is like an unpaid bailee</b> in terms of his liabilities, and this reduced level of safeguarding when returning the item is sufficient.
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: Actually,</b> one can explain that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the finder placed it <b>in</b> the owner’s <b>garden that is secured, or his ruin that is secured; and</b> with regard to that which poses a <b>difficulty to you,</b> that this <b>is</b> the same as <b>his house,</b> there is nevertheless a novelty in this ruling: <b>This teaches us that</b> in this case <b>we do not require the owner’s knowledge</b> that the article has been returned, and this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar.</b>
<b>As Rabbi Elazar says: All</b> those who are obligated to return items to their owners, e.g., a bailee or a thief, <b>require</b> the <b>owner’s knowledge</b> that they are returning it <b>except</b> for one fulfilling the mitzva of <b>returning a lost item.</b> This is <b>because the Torah included many</b> permitted ways of <b>returning</b> lost items by employing the double expression “<i>hashev teshivem</i>,” which serves to permit the return of the lost item without the knowledge of the owner.
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: And you, do you not hold that one safeguarding a lost item is like an unpaid bailee? But doesn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to one who finds <b>a lost item</b> but falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the item from him and takes an oath to that effect, he must <b>pay a double payment,</b> i.e., twice the value of the item. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the finder of a lost item <b>is</b> considered to have the same status as <b>a paid bailee, why</b> in such a case must he <b>pay a double payment? He</b> should <b>be required to pay</b> only <b>the principal,</b> since a paid bailee is liable in any event if the article is stolen or lost, and he did not stand to benefit from the claim that the item was stolen.
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: With what are we dealing here?</b> It is with a case <b>where</b> the finder took a false oath <b>stating the claim</b> that the deposit was taken by <b>an armed bandit,</b> and in such a case even a paid bailee is exempt. Consequently, his claim would have absolved him from liability, and if the item is subsequently found in his possession, he is liable to pay double for his false claim that it was stolen.
Abaye <b>said to him:</b> But <b>an armed bandit</b> has the status of <b>a robber</b> and not of a thief, so according to this explanation, why did Rabbi Yoḥanan state that it was stolen by a thief?
Rav Yosef <b>said to him:</b> The reason that only a thief pays the double payment and not a robber is that a thief denigrates God by exhibiting fear of people by stealing surreptitiously while not exhibiting fear of Heaven. This is in contrast to a robber, who robs openly. Accordingly, the reason <b>that I say that an armed bandit is</b> considered as <b>a thief,</b> is <b>since he hides from people</b> rather than stealing openly. Although he in fact does steal openly, since he does so by employing a weapon he also exhibits fear of people, and is akin to a thief. Therefore, armed bandits are liable to pay a double payment as is a thief, and a claim that the deposit was seized by armed bandits is considered to be the same as a claim that it was stolen by thieves. Consequently, since a paid bailee is absolved by means of such a claim, if it is determined that his claim was false he must pay double.
Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rav Yosef from that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 57b

<b>No, if you say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an unpaid bailee, who pays a double payment, shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the case <b>with regard to a paid bailee, who does not pay a double payment?</b>
Abaye states his objection: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>an armed bandit is</b> considered like <b>a thief, it turns out</b> that there is a case where <b>a paid bailee pays a double payment,</b> and it is <b>when he states the claim that</b> the deposit was taken by <b>an armed bandit.</b>
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: No, if you say</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an unpaid bailee, who pays a double payment for any claim</b> that he makes concerning the theft of the item if he is subsequently found to be lying, <b>shall you</b> also <b>say</b> that this is the case <b>with regard to a paid bailee, who pays a double payment</b> for a false claim <b>only when he states the claim that</b> the deposit was taken by <b>an armed bandit.</b>
Abaye <b>raised an objection to</b> the opinion of Rav Yosef from that which is taught in another <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states with regard to a case where one borrows an object or an animal from another: <b>“And it breaks or dies,</b> he shall pay restitution [<i>shalem yeshalem</i>]” (Exodus 22:13). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that the borrower is liable in a case where the object or animal <b>breaks or dies;</b> but <b>from where</b> do I derive that he is also liable if it was <b>stolen or lost? You</b> can <b>state</b> the following <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And just as a paid bailee, whom</b> the Torah <b>rendered exempt</b> in a case where the item <b>breaks or dies,</b> is nevertheless <b>liable for</b> a case of <b>theft or loss,</b> then with regard to <b>a borrower, who</b> is <b>liable</b> even if the item <b>breaks or dies, is not it logical that he is liable for theft or loss? And this is an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>that has no refutation.</b>
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>an armed bandit</b> is considered like <b>a thief, why</b> is this an argument that has <b>no refutation? It can be refuted</b> as follows: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a paid bailee?</b> He is notable in <b>that</b> he <b>pays double payment if he states the claim that</b> the deposit was taken by <b>an armed bandit,</b> whereas a borrower does not pay double in such a case, but only the principal amount.
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: This <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that the requirement of a borrower to pay <b>the principal without</b> having the option to exempt himself by <b>taking an oath is stricter than</b> the requirement of a paid bailee to pay <b>the double payment</b> when claiming that it was stolen by an armed bandit, as this obligation is in effect only <b>where</b> he took <b>an oath.</b> Therefore, this doubled payment pertaining to a paid bailee cannot be used as a refutation of the <i>a fortiori</i> inference.
The Gemara asks: <b>Let us say</b> that the following <i>baraita</i> <b>supports</b> Rav Yosef’s opinion: In the case of <b>one who rents a cow from another and it is stolen, and this</b> renter <b>says: I will pay</b> for it <b>and I am not taking an oath</b> that the cow was stolen, since I do not wish to take an oath, <b>and afterward the thief is found,</b> the thief <b>pays the double payment to the renter</b> and not to the owner.
The Gemara notes: The Sages who sought to use that <i>baraita</i> to support Rav Yosef’s opinion <b>assumed</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says: A renter is like a paid bailee</b> and is liable for theft or loss, <b>but from</b> the fact <b>that it teaches: And he said: I will pay</b> for it <b>and I am not taking an oath</b> that the cow was stolen, one can learn <b>by inference that if</b> the renter <b>wants, he can exempt himself</b> from payment <b>by</b> taking <b>an oath.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances?</b> Is it not a case <b>where</b> the renter <b>states a claim</b> that the item was taken by <b>an armed bandit,</b> in which case, as a paid bailee, he does not bear liability? <b>And</b> despite this, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: And</b> if <b>afterward the thief was found,</b> the thief <b>pays the double payment to the renter. Conclude from it</b> that <b>an armed bandit</b> is considered like <b>a thief.</b>
The Gemara <b>says</b> in rejection of this proof: <b>Do you maintain</b> that this <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>a renter is</b> considered <b>like a paid bailee? Perhaps</b> this <i>tanna</i> <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>a renter is</b> considered <b>like an unpaid bailee,</b> and on account of that he is absolved of responsibility even if he claimed it was a regular theft.
Alternatively, <b>if you wish, say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to an unarmed bandit and is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba bar Avuh, who reversed</b> the opinions <b>and teaches</b> as follows: <b>How does a renter pay? Rabbi Meir says</b> he has the same liability <b>as a paid bailee,</b> whereas <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> he has the same liability <b>as an unpaid bailee.</b> Therefore, even if this <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, it does not provide support for Rav Yosef’s opinion.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> Even without reversing the opinions, it is possible to explain that the <i>baraita</i> does not provide support for Rav Yosef’s opinion by saying as follows: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case where the renter <b>states the claim that</b> the deposit was taken by <b>an armed bandit,</b> and so he could have absolved himself by taking an oath, <b>but</b> afterward <b>it is found that it was</b> stolen by <b>an unarmed bandit.</b> On account of this, the bandit pays the double payment to the renter. No conclusive proof is brought as to whether one who found a lost item has the status of a paid or unpaid bailee.
§ The mishna teaches: If the animal <b>fell into a garden and derives benefit,</b> the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> it <b>derives. Rav says:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the vegetables softened the impact of <b>striking</b> the ground, and the owner pays for this benefit of the animal being saved from injury.
The Gemara comments: This statement of Rav indicates that the owner pays only for what occurred while the animal landed, <b>but if</b> the animal then <b>ate</b> from the garden, the owner <b>is not</b> required to <b>pay even</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> the animal <b>derives. Shall we say that Rav</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning? As Rav says</b> that in a case where one placed his produce in the courtyard of another without permission, and an animal belonging to the owner of the courtyard ate the produce and was sickened thereby, the owner of the produce is not liable, as he can claim: The animal <b>should not have eaten</b> it. Similarly, here the owner of the animal can say: This animal fell through no fault of mine, and so it is not my fault that it ate.
The Sages of the Gemara <b>say: How can</b> these cases <b>be compared?</b> One could <b>say that Rav said there</b> that the animal <b>should not have eaten</b> the produce. This claim is relevant <b>where</b> the animal <b>itself was injured</b> by eating another’s produce, <b>because the owner of the produce can say: I will not pay,</b> because the animal <b>should not have eaten.</b> This is a claim to exempt the owner of the produce from paying the owner of the animal. <b>Did</b> Rav <b>say</b> that <b>when</b> the animal <b>causes damage to another’s</b> produce, the owner can <b>exempt</b> himself <b>from paying</b> the owner of the produce by stating this claim?
<b>Rather,</b>

Daf 58a

one cannot make such an inference from Rav’s statement. Rav <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> and this is how to understand his statement: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state that if the animal fell into the garden and <b>ate</b> from its produce, <b>that</b> the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> it <b>derives. But</b> if the produce softened the blow of <b>striking</b> the ground and thereby the animal avoided injury, one might <b>say</b> that the owner of the animal should not pay, on the grounds that the owner of the garden may be viewed, analogously, to one who <b>repels a lion from another’s property.</b> In such a case, although the latter benefited from his action, he is not obligated to pay for it. Similarly in this case, one might think that the owner of the animal does <b>not pay even</b> for <b>the benefit that</b> the animal <b>derived.</b> For this reason Rav <b>teaches us</b> that the owner of the animal must pay for this benefit as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b>this is indeed</b> the <i>halakha</i>, and the owner of the animal should be exempt for paying for the benefit of his animal not being injured?
The Gemara answers: One who <b>repels a lion from another’s property</b> does so <b>with intent,</b> knowing that he would be ineligible for payment. By contrast, <b>this</b> owner of the garden did <b>not</b> act <b>with intent</b> and would have preferred for the incident not to have happened. <b>Alternatively,</b> one could say that one who <b>repels a lion from another’s property does not</b> thereby <b>have any loss</b> himself. By contrast, <b>this</b> owner of the garden <b>has a loss,</b> in that his produce is damaged.
The Gemara asks: <b>How did</b> the animal <b>fall?</b> In which case does this <i>halakha</i> apply? <b>Rav Kahana says: It slipped on its</b> own <b>urine. Rava says: Another</b> animal belonging to the same owner <b>pushed it,</b> causing it to fall there.
The Gemara explains: Rava, <b>the one who says that</b> the mishna is referring to a case where <b>another</b> animal <b>pushed it,</b> in which case the owner pays only for the benefit that the animal derived and is exempt from paying for the damage caused, holds that <b>all the more so</b> this <i>halakha</i> would apply in a case <b>where it slipped on its urine,</b> which is beyond the owner’s control. <b>But</b> Rav Kahana, <b>the one who says</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>slipped on its urine,</b> holds that if, <b>however, another</b> animal <b>pushed it,</b> this indicates that the owner <b>was negligent</b> and should have prevented this happening. Therefore, in such a case, the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what</b> his animal <b>damaged, since</b> the owner of the garden <b>can say to</b> the owner of the animal: <b>You should have led</b> your animals <b>across one by one,</b> so that they would not be able to push each other.
<b>Rav Kahana says: They taught only</b> that the owner pays for the benefit that it derives <b>in the same garden bed</b> into which it fell, <b>but</b> if it went <b>from</b> one <b>garden bed to</b> another <b>garden bed</b> and ate from that one, the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what it damaged. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even</b> if the animal goes <b>from</b> one <b>garden bed to</b> another <b>garden bed</b> and eats, <b>and even</b> if the animal continues going from one bed to another and eating for <b>the entire day,</b> the owner pays only for the benefit that the animal derived and not for what it damaged, <b>unless it leaves</b> the garden entirely <b>and returns with</b> the owner’s <b>knowledge.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said,</b> explaining Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement: <b>Do not say</b> this means: <b>Unless</b> the animal <b>leaves with</b> the owner’s <b>knowledge and returns with</b> his <b>knowledge; rather, once it leaves</b> the garden <b>with</b> the owner’s <b>knowledge, even if it returned without</b> his <b>knowledge,</b> the owner is liable to pay for what it damaged. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>that</b> the owner of the garden can <b>say to</b> the owner of the animal: <b>Since</b> the animal <b>has</b> now <b>learned</b> that the garden is there with food to eat, <b>every time it strays it will run to there.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If the animal <b>descended</b> into the garden <b>in its usual manner and caused damage</b> there, the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what it damaged. Rabbi Yirmeya asks:</b> If the animal <b>descended in its usual manner and</b> gave birth to a calf there and <b>damaged</b> the produce <b>with amniotic fluid, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the owner of the animal have to pay for this damage?
The Gemara clarifies Rabbi Yirmeya’s question: <b>Do not raise the dilemma in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that one is <b>liable</b> in a case of damage that is <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident,</b> since in this case the owner was negligent in allowing the animal to enter another person’s courtyard, although the actual causing of the damage was ultimately by accident. <b>When should you raise this dilemma?</b> Raise it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the one who says</b> that one is <b>exempt</b> in a case that is <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case?
The two sides of the question are as follows: <b>Do we say</b> that, <b>since</b> this case is <b>initially through negligence and ultimately by accident,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from liability? <b>Or perhaps here,</b> in this case, <b>it is entirely</b> due to his <b>negligence; since he saw that</b> the animal <b>was close to giving birth, he should have safeguarded it</b> adequately

Daf 58b

<b>and taken care of it,</b> and he bears responsibility for failing to do so. The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>How does</b> the court appraise the value of the damage when the owner <b>pays</b> for <b>what it damaged?</b> The court appraises a large piece of land with an area required for sowing one se’a of seed [<i>beit se’a</i>] in that field, including the garden bed in which the damage took place, it appraises how much it was worth before the animal damaged it and how much is it worth now, and the owner must pay the difference. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived?
<b>Rav Mattana says: As the verse states: “And it feed in another field [<i>uvi’er bisde aḥer</i>]”</b> (Exodus 22:4). This <b>teaches that</b> the court <b>appraises</b> the damage <b>relative to another field,</b> i.e., relative to the damaged field as a whole and not an appraisal of only the specific garden bed that was damaged.
The Gemara asks: But <b>this</b> phrase: <b>“<i>Uvi’er bisde aḥer</i>,”</b> can be understood as meaning: “And it feed in another’s field,” and accordingly, <b>is necessary</b> to teach that the owner is not liable unless it was a field with an owner, <b>to exclude</b> damage caused by an animal in <b>the public domain,</b> for which the owner is not liable.
The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> if this was the sole intention of the verse, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> in the Torah: <b>And it feed in a field belonging to another [<i>uvi’er bisde ḥaveiro</i>], or alternatively,</b> let it write: And it consume <b>another field [<i>sedeh aḥer</i>].” What</b> is conveyed by the particular expression: <b>“In another field [<i>bisde aḥer</i>]”?</b> It is to teach that the court <b>appraises</b> the damage <b>relative to another field.</b>
<b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that this verse <b>comes entirely for this</b> purpose, i.e., to teach that the court appraises the damage relative to another field? And in that case, <b>from where do we</b> derive the <b>exclusion</b> of liability for damage by Eating in <b>the public domain?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the verse was referring solely to the method of appraising the damage, <b>the Merciful One should have written this</b> in the Torah <b>in the context of payment,</b> as follows: <b>His best-quality field and the best quality of his vineyard he shall pay in another field</b> (see Exodus 22:4), thereby adding the term: In another field, and, by extension, the directive concerning how the damage is appraised, to the verse discussing payment. <b>Why do I</b> need <b>the Merciful One to write it in</b> the context of the act of damaging, in the verse: <b>“And it feed</b> in another field”? <b>Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it:</b> The verse is referring to both the place where the damage occurred and the method by which the damage is appraised.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>How do we,</b> the court, <b>appraise</b> the value of the damage? <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says:</b> The court appraises the value of an area required for sowing one <b><i>se’a</i></b> of seed [<i>beit se’a</i>] <b>relative to</b> an area required for sowing <b>sixty <i>se’a</i></b> of seed, and according to this calculation determines the value of the damage. <b>Rabbi Yannai says:</b> The court appraises each <b><i>tarkav</i>,</b> equivalent to half a <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>relative to</b> an area of <b>sixty <i>tarkav</i>. Ḥizkiyya says:</b> The court appraises the value of each <b>stalk</b> eaten <b>relative to sixty stalks.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If an animal <b>ate</b> one <b><i>kav</i> or two <i>kav</i>,</b> the court <b>does not say that</b> the owner <b>pays</b> compensation according to <b>their value,</b> i.e., the value of the actual damage; <b>rather,</b> they <b>view it as if it were a small garden bed and evaluate it</b> accordingly. <b>What, is it not</b> that this means that the court evaluates that garden bed according to what it would cost if sold <b>by itself,</b> which contradicts all the previous explanations?
The Gemara rejects this interpretation: <b>No,</b> it means that the court appraises the value <b>in</b> relation to an area <b>sixty</b> times greater.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> When appraising the damage, the court <b>does not appraise</b> it based on an area of a <i>beit <b>kav</b></i><b>, because</b> doing so <b>enhances his</b> position, <b>and</b> they also do <b>not</b> appraise it relative to an area of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>,</b> equivalent to the area in which one can plant thirty <i>se’a</i> of seed, <b>because this weakens his</b> position.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>saying? Rav Pappa said: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> is <b>saying:</b> The court <b>does not appraise</b> the value of one <b><i>kav</i> relative to</b> an area of <b>sixty <i>kav</i>,</b> which, being too large for an individual but too small for a trader, is always sold in the market at a lower price, <b>because that</b> would <b>enhance</b> the position of <b>the one liable for damage.</b> Conversely, the court does <b>not</b> appraise the value of <b>a <i>kor</i> relative to</b> an area of <b>sixty <i>kor</i>,</b> an area so large that it is purchased only by a person with a specific need and therefore for a high price, <b>because that</b> would <b>weaken</b> the position of <b>the one liable for damage.</b>
<b>Rav Huna bar Manoaḥ objects to this:</b> According to this interpretation, <b>this</b> term employed by the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> they also <b>do not</b> appraise it relative to <b>an area</b> of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>,</b> is imprecise. According to the explanation of Rav Pappa, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have said: And</b> they also <b>do not</b> appraise it relative to <b>a <i>kor</i>,</b> to parallel the term in the previous clause: A <i>kav</i>.
<b>Rather, Rav Huna bar Manoaḥ said in the name of Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika,</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching:</b> The court <b>does not appraise a <i>kav</i> by itself, because that</b> would <b>enhance</b> the position of <b>the injured</b> party, <b>nor</b> does the court appraise <b>a <i>kav</i></b> as one part of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>, because that</b> would <b>weaken</b> the position of <b>the injured</b> party, since damage inside such a large area is insignificant. <b>Rather,</b> the court appraises the damage <b>in</b> relation to an area <b>sixty</b> times greater than the area that was damaged.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who cut down a date palm [<i>kashba</i>]</b> belonging <b>to another.</b> The latter <b>came</b> with the perpetrator for arbitration <b>before the Exilarch.</b> The Exilarch <b>said to</b> the perpetrator: <b>I personally saw</b> that place where the date palm was planted, and it actually contained <b>three date palms [<i>talata</i>] standing</b> together <b>in a cluster,</b> growing out of a single root, <b>and they were worth</b> altogether <b>one hundred dinars.</b> Consequently, since you, the perpetrator, cut down one of the three, <b>go</b> and <b>give him thirty-three and one-third</b> dinars, one third of the total value. The perpetrator rejected this ruling and <b>said: Why do I</b> need to be judged by <b>the Exilarch, who rules according to Persian law? He came before Rav Naḥman</b> for judgment in the same case, who <b>said to him:</b> The court appraises the damage <b>in</b> relation to an area <b>sixty</b> times greater than the damage caused. This amount is much less than thirty-three and one-third dinars.
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>If</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that the court appraises <b>damage</b> caused <b>by one’s property,</b> such as his animal, relative to an area sixty times greater, <b>would</b> they also <b>say</b> that the court appraises damage relative to an area sixty times greater even <b>for</b> direct <b>damage</b> caused by <b>one’s body?</b>
<b>Abaye said to Rava: With regard to damage</b> caused by <b>one’s body, what is your opinion?</b> Are you basing your opinion on the following, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>destroys the vineyard of another</b> while the grapes are <b>budding [<i>semadar</i>],</b> the court <b>views how much</b> the vineyard <b>was worth before</b> he destroyed it, <b>and how much it is worth afterward.</b> Abaye states the inference: <b>Whereas,</b> the method of appraising one part in <b>sixty is not taught.</b> Is the basis of your ruling the fact that in this <i>baraita</i> that discusses damage caused directly by a person, the method of appraising one part in sixty is not mentioned?
Abaye continued: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>with regard to</b> damage caused by <b>an animal it is not taught</b> in a mishna or <i>baraita</i> without mentioning the method of appraising one part in sixty <b>like this case?</b> But this is not so, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If an animal <b>broke down a sapling</b> that had not yet borne fruit, <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Those who issue decrees in Jerusalem say</b> that the damages are determined based on a fixed formula: If the <b>sapling</b> was <b>in its first year,</b> the owner of the animal pays <b>two</b> pieces of <b>silver;</b> if the sapling was <b>two years old,</b> he pays <b>four</b> pieces of <b>silver.</b> If the animal <b>ate unripe blades of grain</b> used for pasture, <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: It is judged according to what remains of it,</b> i.e., the court waits until the rest of the field ripens and then appraises the value of what was previously eaten. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The court <b>views how much</b> the field <b>was worth</b> before he destroyed it, <b>and how much it is worth</b> now.

Daf 59a

If the animal <b>ate</b> the grapes while they were in the <b>budding</b> stage, <b>Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The court <b>views</b> the grapes that were damaged <b>as if they were grapes about to be picked,</b> and appraise the damage based on this. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The court <b>views how much</b> the vineyard <b>was worth</b> before the animal ate the grapes, <b>and how much it is worth</b> now. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that the court appraises the vineyard or group of trees that were damaged, <b>said?</b> It is <b>when</b> the animal <b>ate young branches [<i>lulevei gefanim</i>] of vines or shoots of fig</b> trees, <b>but</b> where <b>it ate unripe figs or unripe grapes,</b> the court <b>views them</b> and appraises them <b>as if</b> they were <b>grapes ready to be picked.</b>
Abaye continues: <b>In any event, it teaches</b> that <b>the Rabbis say:</b> The court <b>views how much</b> the vineyard <b>was worth</b> before the animal ate the produce <b>and how much it is worth</b> now, <b>and</b> it <b>does not teach</b> that the court appraises the damage relative to an area <b>sixty</b> times greater.
<b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> You must say that the wording employed by the <i>baraita</i> is to be understood to mean that the court appraises the damage <b>relative to</b> an area <b>sixty</b> times greater, so <b>here too,</b> in the <i>baraita</i> dealing with one who himself causes damage, the wording is to be understood to mean that the damage is valued <b>relative to</b> an area <b>sixty</b> times greater.
<b>Abaye said: Rabbi Yosei HaGelili and Rabbi Yishmael</b> both <b>said the same thing.</b> They are of the same opinion that the appraisal for damages is based on the value of the produce remaining in the field once it ripens.
The opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> is <b>this that we stated</b> above in the <i>baraita</i>, i.e., that the damages paid for an animal eating unripe grain is assessed according to what remains of the grain.
The opinion of <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“The best of his field and the best of his vineyard he shall pay”</b> (Exodus 22:4), which means he must pay according to the <b>best</b>-quality <b>field of the injured</b> party <b>or the best</b>-quality <b>vineyard of the injured</b> party. <b>This is the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says: The verse comes only</b> to allow <b>injured</b> parties <b>to collect</b> compensation <b>from</b> the <b>superior-quality</b> land of the one liable to pay for the damage, <b>and</b> by an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference it is derived that this applies <b>to consecrated</b> property. Compensation for damaging consecrated property is paid from one’s best-quality assets.
<b>And do not say</b> that Rabbi Yishmael’s statement should be interpreted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Idi bar Avin, as Rav Idi bar Avin says:</b> Here it concerns a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>ate</b> the produce of <b>one garden bed from among</b> several <b>garden beds, but we do not know whether</b> the garden bed it ate from <b>was lean or choice. Therefore,</b> the verse <b>says</b> to the owner of the animal: <b>Arise</b> and <b>pay choice</b> land, equivalent <b>to the best</b>-quality land <b>that there is now</b> remaining, and the court does not assume that the animal ate produce from the lesser-quality garden bed, <b>as we do not say this.</b>
<b>What is the reason</b> that Rabbi Yishmael does not hold in accordance with the opinion of Rav Idi bar Avin? It is because he accepts the principle that <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant;</b> without such proof, the owner of the animal pays only the value of a lesser-quality garden bed. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yishmael interprets the Torah’s expression “the best of his field” as requiring payment <b>with the best</b>-quality land <b>before him, and what is this?</b> It is <b>that which</b> remained in the field and subsequently <b>sprouted,</b> and the compensation is based on the value of this.
The Gemara examines the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said: Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that the court appraises the vineyard or group of trees that were damaged <b>said?</b> It is <b>when</b> the animal <b>ate young branches of vines or shoots of fig</b> trees. The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> indicates that if the animal ate <b>budding</b> grapes the court <b>views them</b> and appraises them <b>as if</b> they were <b>grapes ready to be picked.</b> But <b>say,</b> and try to explain accordingly, <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, which teaches that if the animal <b>ate unripe figs or half-ripe grapes, that is</b> where the court <b>views them as if</b> they were <b>grapes ready to be picked,</b> indicating that if the animal ate the grapes in the <b>budding</b> stage, the court <b>views how much</b> the vineyard <b>was worth</b> before the animal ate them <b>and how much it is worth</b> now. Therefore, the two clauses of the <i>baraita</i> appear to be contradictory.
<b>Ravina said: Bind</b> them together <b>and teach</b> them as a single statement, as follows: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said</b> that the court appraises how much the field was worth when the animal ate from it? It is said in a case <b>when</b> the animal <b>ate young branches of vines or shoots of fig trees. But</b> if it <b>ate</b> grapes in the <b>budding</b> stage, <b>unripe figs, or half-ripe grapes,</b> the court <b>views them</b> and appraises them <b>as if</b> they were <b>grapes ready to be picked.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b> with regard to grapes in the budding stage. Why would the mishna state their opinions separately?
The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> with regard to <b>the weakening of the vine.</b> A vine is weakened by the grapes growing on it, as they draw nutrients from the roots and branches. Now that the grapes have been eaten, the vine is no longer weakened. Therefore, according to one opinion, the court takes into consideration this reduction of the weakening of the vine, and that amount is deducted when calculating the damages, whereas according to the other opinion, the court does not take this into account. <b>But</b> their respective opinions are <b>not defined,</b> and it is not clear which <i>tanna</i> takes this weakening into account and which does not.
<b>Abaye said:</b> Their respective opinions <b>are certainly defined,</b> and it is possible to know which Sage held which opinion, since <b>who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who <b>is concerned for the weakening of the vine? It is Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya:</b> With regard to the indemnity payments that <b>a rapist</b> must pay his victim, who had been a virgin, he <b>does not pay</b> compensation for <b>the pain</b> caused by the rape. This is <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>she will ultimately suffer</b> the same pain during her first act of sexual intercourse <b>with her husband</b> when she marries. The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> The pain of a woman who <b>has intercourse willingly is not comparable to</b> the pain of a woman <b>who has intercourse by rape.</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda considers future pain when considering payment of damages, and similarly, he considers the reduced weakening of the vine.
<b>Abaye said: These <i>tanna’im</i></b> following <b>and Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda said the same thing</b> concerning this matter. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda</b> said <b>this</b> ruling <b>that we said</b> with regard to the case of rape and the case of the vine. As to <b>these</b> other <b><i>tanna’im</i>, what is</b> the case about which they gave a similar ruling?
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the <i>halakha</i> of one who injured a pregnant woman, thereby causing her to miscarry, for which the Torah holds him liable to pay her husband compensation. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The court appraises the compensation for the miscarried offspring and <b>deducts</b> the amount they would have paid for <b>a midwife.</b> Since she miscarried, the husband no longer has to pay for a midwife, so that is deducted from the compensation. <b>Ben Azzai says:</b> The court <b>deducts</b> the value of the extra <b>sustenance</b> the husband would have been required to provide for his pregnant wife.
<b>The one who says</b> that the court appraises the compensation for the miscarried offspring <b>less</b> the amount they would have paid for <b>a midwife</b> would <b>all the more so</b> concede that the appraisal is <b>less</b> the value of the extra <b>sustenance. But the one who says</b> that the appraisal is <b>less</b> the value of the extra <b>sustenance</b> does <b>not</b> necessarily hold that the court appraises the compensation for the miscarried offspring <b>less</b> the money they would have paid for <b>a midwife, since</b> the husband <b>can say to</b> the assailant: <b>My wife is capable and does not require a midwife</b> to assist her when giving birth.
Returning to the discussion of the appraisal of compensation for damage, the Gemara relates: <b>Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, acted in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman</b> and appraised a damaged date palm <b>relative to</b> an area <b>sixty</b> times greater than the particular area where the tree was standing.
<b>A different version</b> of this <i>halakha</i> is also stated: <b>Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, appraised</b> the damage caused to <b>a date palm relative to</b> the assessment of <b>the patch of land</b> where the tree stood, i.e., how much it was worth with the tree and how much it was worth without it.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, with regard to an Aramean date palm,</b> i.e., one of lesser quality, and it is assessed relative to the land, <b>but the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Exilarch with regard to a Persian date palm,</b> as they are of higher quality and each one is valuable, and it is not assessed relative to the land.
The Gemara relates: <b>Eliezer Ze’eira</b>

Daf 59b

<b>was wearing black shoes,</b> unlike the Jewish custom of that time, <b>and standing in the market of Neharde’a.</b> Officials <b>of the house of the Exilarch found him and said to him: What is different</b> about you that causes you to wear <b>these shoes? He said to them:</b> I am wearing them <b>because I am in mourning over</b> the destruction of the Temple and <b>Jerusalem,</b> and so I wear black shoes, as is the custom of mourners. <b>They said to him: Are you</b> a man of such <b>importance to</b> publicly <b>mourn over Jerusalem? They thought that it was</b> simply <b>presumptuousness</b> on his part. Since he was acting against the prevalent Jewish custom, <b>they brought him</b> to the prison <b>and incarcerated him.</b>
Eliezer Ze’eira <b>said to them: I am a great man,</b> a scholar, and it is fitting for me to mourn publicly over the destruction of Jerusalem. <b>They said to him: How do we know</b> that you are a scholar? <b>He said to them: Either you ask of me a matter</b> of <i>halakha</i> and I will answer you, <b>or I will ask you a matter</b> of <i>halakha</i> and you will answer me. <b>They said to him: You ask.</b>
<b>He said to them:</b> With regard to <b>one who cuts</b> a cluster of flowers on <b>the stem</b> of a date palm belonging to another, <b>what</b> is he required to <b>pay? They said to him: He pays the value of the</b> date <b>stem.</b> He said to them: <b>But</b> ultimately <b>they will become</b> ripe <b>dates,</b> which are worth more. <b>They said to him:</b> If so, <b>he pays the value of</b> the future <b>dates. He said to them: But he did not take</b> ripe <b>dates from</b> the other person, so how can the court obligate him to pay for damage that he did not cause?
<b>They said to</b> Eliezer Ze’eira: <b>You tell us</b> the correct appraisal for the date stem. <b>He said to them:</b> The court appraises the damage relative to a similar piece of land <b>sixty</b> times the size. <b>They said to him: Who says</b> an opinion <b>as you</b> do, so that you can prove you are correct? <b>He said to them: Shmuel is alive and his court exists;</b> you can ask him. <b>They sent</b> the question <b>before Shmuel,</b> together with the ruling of Eliezer Ze’eira. Shmuel <b>said to them: He is saying well to you,</b> because the <i>halakha</i> is as he says; the appraisal is <b>relative to</b> an area <b>sixty</b> times greater. Upon hearing this, the officials of the Exilarch realized that he was a great man <b>and they released him.</b>
§ The mishna (55b) teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> If the animal <b>ate ripe produce,</b> the owner pays the value of the ripe produce eaten. <b>What is the reason</b> for Rabbi Shimon’s opinion? <b>This that the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And it feed in another’s field”</b> (Exodus 22:4), which <b>teaches that</b> the court <b>appraises</b> the damage <b>relative to</b> another <b>field, this statement</b> applies specifically with regard to <b>produce</b> that <b>requires a field</b> to grow. For one’s animal eating this <b>produce, which do not require the field</b> in order to ripen further, the animal’s owner <b>must pay</b> their value <b>as they are.</b>
<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says: Rav judged</b> a practical <i>halakha</i> on a certain issue <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> despite the fact that in general the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with his opinion. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>he ruled</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> even though in that case his was a minority opinion.
Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya explains: <b>Rav judged</b> a practical <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a field designated by its owner as a lien for his wife’s marriage contract, which he subsequently wants to sell, if <b>he wrote</b> a document of sale <b>to a first</b> buyer, <b>but</b> his wife <b>did not sign for him</b> to endorse the sale, and subsequently the husband wrote a document of sale <b>to a second</b> buyer, <b>and</b> his wife <b>signed for him, she</b> thereby <b>loses</b> the lien of <b>her marriage contract,</b> since the sale is effective and she can no longer collect from this field; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>she can say: I did</b> it only to <b>please my husband,</b> but I did not mean it and never intended to forgo my rights. <b>What</b> claim <b>do you,</b> the purchasers, <b>have against me?</b> Therefore, the lien is still in effect. Rav judged a case in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir.
<b>And</b> Rav <b>ruled</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, as we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> If one’s animal <b>ate ripe produce,</b> the owner <b>pays</b> the value of <b>ripe produce</b> eaten. Therefore, <b>if</b> it ate <b>one <i>se’a</i></b> of produce, he pays the value of <b>one <i>se’a</i></b> of produce, and <b>if</b> it ate <b>two <i>se’a</i>,</b> he pays for <b>two <i>se’a</i>.</b> Although Rabbi Shimon’s opinion is the minority one, Rav ruled in accordance with it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>one who stacks</b> his produce <b>in another’s field without permission</b> from the owner of that field, <b>and an animal belonging to the owner of the field eats</b> the produce, the owner of the field is <b>exempt. And if</b> the animal <b>is injured by</b> the produce, <b>the owner of the stack</b> is <b>liable. But if he stacked</b> them in that field <b>with permission, the owner of the field</b> is <b>liable</b> for damage caused to the produce.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>that which we learned</b> in the mishna <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? <b>As, if</b> the mishna were <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>doesn’t he say:</b> A homeowner who gives another permission to bring items into his courtyard is not responsible for them <b>unless the homeowner accepts on himself to safeguard</b> them? The mishna does not mention any such acceptance of responsibility. <b>Rav Pappa said: Here we are dealing with the supervisor of the threshing floors,</b> to whom people would entrust their produce. <b>As, since the supervisor says</b> to the owner of the produce: <b>Bring</b> it <b>in and stack</b> it, it is as though he had said to him: <b>Bring</b> it <b>in and I will supervise</b> it <b>for you.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who sends a fire,</b> i.e., places a burning object, <b>in the hand of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor</b> is <b>exempt</b> for any damage later caused by the fire <b>according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven.</b> If <b>he sent</b> it <b>in the hand of a</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> person, <b>the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> person is <b>liable,</b> not the one who sent him.
If <b>one</b> person <b>brought the fire, and one</b> other person subsequently <b>brought the wood,</b> causing the fire to spread, <b>the one who brought the wood</b> is <b>liable</b> for any damage caused. Conversely, if <b>one</b> person first <b>brought the wood, and</b> subsequently <b>one</b> other person <b>brought the fire, the one who brought the fire</b> is <b>liable,</b> since it was he who actually kindled the wood.
If <b>another came and fanned</b> the flame, and as a result the fire spread and caused damage, <b>the one who fanned it</b> is <b>liable,</b> since he is the proximate cause of the damage. If <b>the wind fanned</b> the flames, <b>all</b> the people involved are <b>exempt,</b> since none of them actually caused the damage.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Reish Lakish says in the name of Ḥizkiyya: They taught</b> that one who sends fire in the hand of a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor is exempt <b>only when he conveyed to him</b> a glowing <b>coal and</b> one of these people <b>fanned</b> it himself and set it alight. <b>But</b> if one <b>conveyed a torch to</b> a deaf-mute, imbecile, or minor, the one who gave it to him is <b>liable. What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? <b>The action</b> of the one who gave it to him directly <b>caused</b> the fire to spread.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Even</b> if <b>he conveyed a torch to him,</b> he is <b>exempt. What is the reason?</b> It is the <b>tongs of the deaf-mute that caused</b> the damage, since torches do not cause fires on their own. <b>And</b> the one who gives dangerous objects to a deaf-mute is <b>not rendered liable</b> for the damage caused, <b>unless he conveys branches [<i>gavza</i>] to him</b>

Daf 60a

<b>of thin wood</b> and <b>a candle [<i>sheraga</i>], since</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>his</b> own <b>action,</b> i.e., that of the one who sent the flame, <b>definitely caused</b> the fire to spread.
The mishna teaches that if one <b>sent</b> a fire <b>in the hand of a</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> person, <b>the</b> halakhically <b>competent</b> person is <b>liable…</b>If another came and fanned the flame the one who fanned it is liable. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says</b> with regard to the correct text of the mishna: The <b>one who teaches</b> it using the word <b>fanned [<i>libba</i>] is not mistaken, and</b> the <b>one who teaches</b> it using the word <b>blew [<i>nibba</i>] is not mistaken.</b>
Rav Naḥman explained: The <b>one who teaches</b> using the word <b>fanned [<i>libba</i>] is not mistaken, as it is written: “With a flame [<i>belabbat</i>] of fire”</b> (Exodus 3:2), <b>and</b> the <b>one who teaches</b> using the word <b>blew [<i>nibba</i>] is not mistaken, as it is written: “He creates the fruit [<i>niv</i>] of the lips”</b> (Isaiah 57:19), which can be interpreted as referring to the breath of the lips.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>the wind fanned</b> the flames, <b>all</b> the people involved <b>are exempt,</b> indicating that even if one fanned the fire at the same time that the wind was blowing he is exempt. The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> in which <b>the Sages taught</b> the same idea explicitly: In a case where <b>one fanned</b> the flame <b>and</b> at the same time <b>the wind</b> fanned it, <b>if his fanning has</b> sufficient strength by itself <b>to fan</b> the flames, he is <b>liable</b> for damage caused by the fire, since even without the wind the fire would have spread. <b>But if</b> his fanning alone was <b>not</b> sufficient, he is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is he exempt if his fanning is not sufficient? <b>Let it be</b> the same <i>halakha</i> <b>as</b> the case of one who <b>winnows</b> grain on Shabbat by throwing it into the air, <b>and the wind assists him</b> by separating the chaff from the grain. In such a case he is liable for desecrating Shabbat, despite the fact that without the assistance of the wind he would not have been able to winnow the grain.
<b>Abaye said: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he fanned</b> the fire <b>from one side and the wind fanned</b> it <b>from the other side,</b> and the fire was blown in the direction the wind was blowing. Therefore, it is clear that his fanning did not help the fire spread, so he is exempt. <b>Rava says:</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he fanned</b> it along <b>with a typical wind,</b> and this was not sufficient to cause the fire to spread, <b>and</b> suddenly <b>an atypical wind</b> came and <b>fanned it.</b> Therefore, he is exempt since he could not have anticipated this. <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> he only <b>heated [<i>detzamera tzamurei</i>]</b> the fire by breathing on it, rather than fanning it properly.
<b>Rav Ashi said: When we say</b> that one is liable in a case where he <b>winnows and the wind assists him, this statement</b> applies <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat.</b> With regard to Shabbat, the principle is <b>that the Torah prohibited planned,</b> constructive <b>labor.</b> The primary consideration is that his objective is accomplished, even if he did not perform the entire act of labor. <b>But here,</b> in the context of damages, <b>he is</b> considered to have caused damage <b>merely</b> through <b>indirect</b> action, <b>and</b> one who causes <b>damage</b> through <b>indirect</b> action is <b>exempt.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>sends</b> forth <b>a fire,</b> i.e., allows it to escape, <b>and it consumes wood, or stones, or earth,</b> he is <b>liable, as it is stated: “If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns, so that a stack of grain, or standing grain, or the field, is consumed, the one who kindled the fire shall pay compensation”</b> (Exodus 22:5), which teaches that he is liable also for destroying the field itself.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the verse cited in the mishna, <b>Rava says: Why do I</b> need <b>the Merciful One</b> to write in the Torah all of these terms: <b>“Thorns,” “a stack of grain,” “standing grain,” and “field,”</b> which seem to be redundant?
Rava explains: All the terms <b>are necessary, because if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>“thorns”</b> in the Torah, <b>I would say</b> that it is specifically <b>thorns for which the Merciful One renders one liable, because</b> it is <b>common</b> for <b>fire</b> to be <b>near them, and</b> it <b>is common that</b> one is <b>negligent. But</b> with regard to <b>a stack of grain,</b> with regard to <b>which it is not common</b> for <b>fire</b> to be <b>near it,</b> as grain is valuable, so one keeps it out of harm’s way, and it <b>is not common that</b> one is <b>negligent</b> in allowing it to catch fire, I would <b>say</b> that he should <b>not</b> be liable. <b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> only: <b>“A stack of grain,” I would say</b> that it is specifically for such <b>a stack</b> that <b>the Merciful One renders him liable, because</b> it involves <b>a substantial</b> financial <b>loss. But</b> with regard to <b>thorns,</b> which involve only <b>a minimal loss,</b> I would <b>say</b> that he should <b>not</b> be liable. Therefore, the verse teaches that he is liable for damage to thorns as well.
<b>Why do I</b> need the Torah to state the term <b>“standing grain”?</b> It is in order to teach that <b>just as standing grain is exposed, so too,</b> one is liable only for damage caused by fire <b>for all</b> items that are <b>exposed.</b> One is exempt from liability for damage to items that are concealed.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who deems</b> one <b>liable for a concealed</b> article damaged <b>by a fire, why do I</b> need the Torah to state the term: <b>“Standing grain”?</b> The Gemara answers: The term serves <b>to include all</b> items <b>that have stature,</b> i.e., trees and animals, and not only produce. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who derive the <i>halakha</i> of concealed articles from the term “standing grain,” <b>from where do they</b> derive that <b>all</b> items <b>that have stature</b> are <b>included?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from</b> the term: <b>“Or standing grain,”</b> since the additional word “or” is an inclusive term.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> derive from the additional word “or”? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires</b> the word <b>“or” to divide</b> the terms, i.e., to teach that one is liable for damage to any one of the items listed, and not only where the fire burned all of them together. The Gemara then asks: <b>And from where do the Rabbis</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> <b>to divide</b> the terms so that one is liable for damage to each one independently? The Gemara answers: <b>They derive it from</b> the second instance of the word “or,” as the verse states: <b>“Or the field.”</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> derive from the phrase “or the field”? The Gemara answers: <b>Since the Merciful One wrote</b> in the Torah: <b>“Or standing grain,” He</b> also <b>wrote: “Or the field,”</b> for stylistic consistency, but no additional <i>halakha</i> may be derived from this term.
Rava continues to elaborate on the different terms in the verse: And <b>why do I</b> need the word <b>“field”</b> in the verse? It serves <b>to include</b> liability for damage in a case when the flames <b>licked a plowed field and charred its stones.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But let the Merciful One write</b> only the term <b>“field,” and</b> then it would <b>not require all these</b> other terms. If one is liable for damage to a field, which is not totally destroyed by the fire, he is certainly liable for damage to other items that are completely destroyed. The Gemara answers: It is <b>necessary</b> to write the other terms as well, <b>because if the Merciful One</b> had <b>written</b> only <b>“field,” I would say that</b> for <b>what is in the field, yes,</b> one is liable, but for <b>anything else, no,</b> one is not liable. Therefore, it <b>teaches us</b> that one is liable for any damage caused by fire.
§ The Gemara cites an aggadic midrash based on this verse: <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Calamity befalls the world only when wicked</b> people are <b>in the world, but</b> the calamity <b>begins only with the righteous first, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns,</b> so that a stack of grain, or standing grain, or the field, is consumed” (Exodus 22:5). <b>When does the fire,</b> i.e., calamity, <b>emerge?</b> At a time <b>when the thorns,</b> i.e., the wicked, <b>are found with it. But</b> calamity <b>begins only from the righteous first, as it is stated</b> in the continuation of the verse: <b>“And a stack of grain is consumed [<i>vene’ekhal</i>].” It is not stated:</b> If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns, <b>and consumes [<i>ve’akhal</i>] the stack of grain; rather,</b> it states: <b>“A stack of grain is consumed,”</b> meaning <b>that</b> the <b>stack,</b> i.e., the righteous, <b>has already been consumed</b> before the thorns.
<b>Rav Yosef taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> with regard to the plague of the firstborn: <b>“And none of you shall go out of the opening of his house until the morning”</b> (Exodus 12:22)? If the plague was not decreed upon the Jewish people, why were they not permitted to leave their homes? <b>Once permission</b> is granted <b>to the destroyer</b> to kill, <b>it does not distinguish between the righteous and the wicked. And not only</b> that, <b>but it begins with the righteous first, as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked”</b> (Ezekiel 21:8), where mention of the righteous precedes the wicked.
<b>Rav Yosef cried</b> and said: <b>Are all these</b> righteous people <b>also compared to nothing</b> when calamity strikes? <b>Abaye said to him: It is goodness for</b> the righteous that they die first, <b>as it is written: “The righteous is taken away because of the evil to come”</b> (Isaiah 57:1), so that he will not have to endure the suffering that will befall the people.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b>

Daf 60b

<b>A person</b> should <b>always enter</b> an unfamiliar city <b>at</b> a time of <b>good,</b> i.e., while it is light, as the Torah uses the expression “It is good” with regard to the creation of light (see Genesis 1:4). This goodness is manifest in the sense of security one feels when it is light. <b>And</b> likewise, when one leaves a city <b>he</b> should <b>leave at</b> a time of <b>good,</b> meaning after sunrise the next morning, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And none of you shall go out of the opening of his house until the morning”</b> (Exodus 12:22).
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> If there is <b>plague in the city, gather your feet,</b> i.e., limit the time you spend out of the house, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And none of you shall go out of the opening of his house until the morning.” And it says</b> in another verse: <b>“Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your doors behind you;</b> hide yourself for a little moment, until the anger has passed by” (Isaiah 26:20). <b>And it says: “Outside the sword will bereave, and in the chambers terror”</b> (Deuteronomy 32:25).
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the reason for citing the additional verses introduced with the term: <b>And it says?</b> The first verse seems sufficient to teach the principle that one should not emerge from one’s house when there is a plague. The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> the first verse that states that none of you shall go out until morning, applies only <b>at night, but in the day</b> one may think that the principle does <b>not</b> apply, for this reason the Gemara teaches: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: “Come, my people, enter into your chambers, and shut your doors behind you.”</b>
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>this matter</b> applies only <b>where there is no fear inside,</b> which explains why it is preferable to remain indoors, <b>but where there is fear inside,</b> one might think that <b>when he goes out</b> and <b>sits among people in general company</b> it is <b>better,</b> therefore, the Gemara introduces the third verse and says: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: “Outside the sword will bereave, and in the chambers terror.”</b> This means that <b>although there is terror in the chambers, outside the sword will bereave,</b> so it is safer to remain indoors.
<b>At a time</b> when there was a <b>plague, Rava would close the windows</b> of his house, <b>as it is written: “For death is come up into our windows”</b> (Jeremiah 9:20).
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If there is <b>famine in the city, spread your feet,</b> i.e., leave the city, <b>as it is stated</b> in the verse: <b>“And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there”</b> (Genesis 12:10). <b>And it says: “If we say: We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there;</b> and if we sit here, we die also, now come, and let us fall unto the host of the Arameans; if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die” (II Kings 7:4).
<b>What</b> is the reason for citing the second verse, introduced with the term: <b>And it says? And if you would say</b> that <b>this matter,</b> the principle of leaving the city, applies only <b>where there is no uncertainty</b> concerning <b>a life-threatening</b> situation, <b>but where there is uncertainty</b> concerning <b>a life-threatening</b> situation this principle does <b>not</b> apply, <b>come</b> and <b>hear: “Come, and let us fall unto the host of the Arameans; if they save us alive, we shall live;</b> and if they kill us, we shall but die.”
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If there is <b>a plague in the city, a person should not walk in the middle of the road, due to</b> the fact <b>that the Angel of Death walks in the middle of the road, as, since</b> in Heaven <b>they have given him permission</b> to kill within the city, <b>he goes openly</b> in the middle of the road. By contrast, if there is <b>peace</b> and quiet <b>in the city, do not walk on the sides of the road, as, since</b> the Angel of Death <b>does not have permission</b> to kill within the city, <b>he hides</b> himself <b>and walks</b> on the side of the road.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If there is <b>a plague in the city, a person should not enter the synagogue alone, as the Angel of Death leaves his utensils there,</b> and for this reason it is a dangerous place. <b>And this matter,</b> the danger in the synagogue, applies only <b>when there are no children learning in</b> the synagogue, <b>and</b> there are <b>not ten</b> men <b>praying in it.</b> But if there are children learning or ten men praying there, it is not a dangerous place.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> If the <b>dogs</b> in a certain place <b>are crying</b> for no reason, it is a sign that they feel the <b>Angel of Death has come to the city.</b> If the <b>dogs are playing,</b> it is a sign that they feel that <b>Elijah the prophet has come to the city. These matters</b> apply only <b>if there is no female</b> dog among them. If there is a female dog nearby, their crying or playing is likely due to her presence.
§ <b>Rav Ami and Rav Asi sat before Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa.</b> One <b>Sage said to</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa: <b>Let the Master say</b> words of <b><i>halakha</i>, and</b> the other <b>Sage said to</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa: <b>Let the Master say</b> words of <b><i>aggada</i>.</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa <b>began to say</b> words of <b><i>aggada</i> but</b> one <b>Sage did not let him,</b> so he <b>began to say</b> words of <b><i>halakha</i> but</b> the other <b>Sage did not let him.</b>
Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa <b>said to them: I will relate a parable. To what can this be compared?</b> It can be compared <b>to a man who has two wives, one young and one old. The young</b> wife <b>pulls out his white</b> hairs, so that her husband will appear younger. <b>The old</b> wife <b>pulls out his black</b> hairs so that he will appear older. And it <b>turns out</b> that he is <b>bald from here and from there,</b> i.e., completely bald, due to the actions of both of his wives.
Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa continued and <b>said to them: If so, I will say to you a matter that is appropriate to both of you,</b> which contains both <i>halakha</i> and <i>aggada</i>. In the verse that states: <b>“If a fire breaks out, and catches in thorns”</b> (Exodus 22:5), the term <b>“breaks out”</b> indicates that it breaks out <b>by itself.</b> Yet, the continuation of the verse states: <b>“The one who kindled the fire shall pay compensation,”</b> which indicates that he must pay only if the fire spread due to his negligence. The verse can be explained allegorically: <b>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said</b> that although the fire broke out in the Temple due to the sins of the Jewish people, <b>it is incumbent upon Me to pay</b> restitution <b>for the fire that I kindled.</b>
<b>I,</b> God, <b>kindled a fire in Zion, as it is stated:</b> “The Lord has accomplished His fury, He has poured out His fierce anger; <b>and He has kindled a fire in Zion, which has devoured its foundations”</b> (Lamentations 4:11). <b>And I will build it with fire</b> in the <b>future, as it is stated: “For I,</b> says the Lord, <b>will be for her a wall of fire round about; and I will be the glory in her midst”</b> (Zechariah 2:9).
There is <b>a <i>halakha</i></b> that can be learned from the verse in Exodus, as <b>the verse begins with damage</b> caused through one’s <b>property:</b> “If a fire breaks out,” <b>and concludes with damage</b> caused by <b>one’s body:</b> “The one who kindled the fire.” This indicates that when damage is caused by fire, it is considered as though the person who kindled the fire caused the damage directly with his body. That serves <b>to say to you</b> that the liability for <b>his fire</b> damage is <b>due to</b> its similarity to <b>his arrows.</b> Just as one who shoots an arrow and causes damage is liable because the damage was caused directly through his action, so too, one who kindles a fire that causes damage is liable because it is considered as though the damage were caused directly by his actions.
§ The Gemara continues with another statement of <i>aggada</i> on a related topic: The verse states: <b>“And David longed, and said: Oh, that one would give me water to drink of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate! And the three mighty men broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate,</b> and took it, and brought it to David; but he would not drink it, but poured it out to the Lord” (II Samuel 23:15–16). The Sages understood that David was not simply asking for water, but was using the term as a metaphor referring to Torah, and he was raising a halakhic dilemma.
<b>What is the dilemma</b> that David <b>is raising? Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: He was asking</b> about the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a concealed</b> article damaged by <b>a fire.</b> He wanted to know whether the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that one is liable to pay for such damage, or <b>whether</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that one is exempt from liability for damage by fire to concealed articles. <b>And</b> the Sages in Bethlehem <b>answered him what they answered him.</b>
<b>Rav Huna stated</b> a different explanation of the verse: <b>There were stacks of barley belonging to Jews in which the Philistines were hiding, and</b> David wanted to burn down the stacks to kill the Philistines and save his own life. <b>He raised the dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it permitted <b>to save oneself</b> by destroying <b>the property of another?</b>
<b>They sent</b> the following answer <b>to him: It is prohibited to save oneself</b> by destroying <b>the property of another. But you are king, and a king may breach the fence</b> of an individual <b>in order to form a path for himself, and none may protest his</b> action, i.e., the normal <i>halakhot</i> of damage do not apply to you since you are king.
<b>The Rabbis, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rabba bar Mari,</b> give an alternative explanation of the dilemma and <b>said: The stacks of barley belonged to Jews, and</b> there were <b>stacks of lentils belonging to the Philistines.</b> David needed barley to feed his animals. <b>And</b> David <b>raised the</b> following <b>dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? I know that I may take the lentils belonging to a gentile to feed my animals, but is it permitted <b>to take a stack of barley</b> belonging to <b>a Jew, to place before one’s animal</b> for it to consume, <b>with the intent to pay</b> the owner of the barley with the <b>stacks of lentils belonging to the Philistines?</b>
The Sages of Bethlehem <b>sent</b> the following reply <b>to him: “If the wicked restore the pledge, give back that which he had taken by robbery,</b> walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity; he shall surely live, he shall not die” (Ezekiel 33:15). This verse teaches that <b>even though</b> the robber <b>repays</b> the value of the <b>stolen item, he</b> is nevertheless considered to be <b>wicked,</b> and is described as such in the verse, and a commoner would not be allowed to act as you asked. <b>But you are king, and a king may breach the fence</b> of an individual <b>in order to form a path for himself, and none may protest his</b> action.
The Gemara discusses the different explanations: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that David was asking whether he could take the stacks of barley and <b>exchange</b> them, i.e., repay the owners of the barley, with stacks of lentils, <b>this is as it is written</b> in <b>one verse:</b> “And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, <b>where was a plot of ground full of lentils;</b> and the people fled from the Philistines” (II Samuel 23:11), <b>and it is written</b> in <b>one</b> other <b>verse:</b> “He was with David at Pas Dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, <b>where was a plot of ground full of barley;</b> and the people fled from before the Philistines” (I Chronicles 11:13). This apparent contradiction can be reconciled by saying that there were two fields, one of barley and one of lentils.
<b>But according to</b> Rav Huna, <b>the one who says</b> that David’s question was asked because he wanted <b>to burn</b> the stacks of barley, for <b>what</b> purpose <b>does he require these two verses?</b> How does he explain this contradiction? Rav Huna could have <b>said to you that there were also stacks of lentils belonging to Jews, inside which the Philistines were hiding.</b>
<b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that David asked his question because he wanted <b>to burn</b> the stacks, <b>this is as it is writ-ten</b> in the following verse with regard to David: <b>“But he stood in the midst of the plot, and saved it,</b> and slew the Philistines; and the Lord performed a great victory” (II Samuel 23:12). <b>But according to the one who says</b> that David’s question was asked <b>with regard to exchanging</b> the lentils for the barley, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“And saved it”?</b>
The Rabbis answer that David saved it in <b>that he did not permit them to exchange</b> the value of the barley with the lentils.
<b>Granted,</b> according to both of <b>these two</b> opinions, <b>this is as it is written</b> in <b>two</b> distinct <b>verses,</b> one describing the field of lentils and one describing the field of barley.

Daf 61a

<b>But according to</b> Rava, who cited Rav Naḥman, <b>the one who says</b> that David <b>asked</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a concealed</b> article damaged by <b>a fire,</b> for <b>what</b> purpose does <b>he require the</b> two <b>verses</b> that describe a field of lentils and a field of barley? Rav Naḥman could have <b>said to you</b> that David <b>was asking</b> both about <b>concealed</b> articles damaged by a fire <b>and one of these</b> other two dilemmas.
<b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> one of <b>these two</b> explanations, that David was asking either about repaying barley with lentils or burning the stacks of barley, <b>this is as it is written</b> of David: <b>“But he would not drink it”</b> (II Samuel 23:16). David <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Since there is a prohibition</b> involved in this action, <b>it is not satisfactory to me</b> to act in this manner, even though technically it is permitted for a king. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that David <b>was raising a dilemma</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a concealed</b> article damaged by <b>a fire, since they sent him</b> an answer that was <b>a tradition</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i>, <b>what</b> is the meaning of: “But <b>he would not drink it”?</b>
The Gemara answers: This means <b>that he did not say the <i>halakha</i> in their names.</b> He did not transmit the ruling in the name of those who went in the time of battle to ask the Sages what the <i>halakha</i> is. David <b>said</b> to himself: <b>This</b> is the tradition that <b>I received from the court of Samuel of Rama:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who hands himself</b> over <b>to die for</b> the sake of <b>words of Torah,</b> the Sages <b>do not say a matter of <i>halakha</i> in his name,</b> so that others will not follow this ruling and endanger their lives.
The Gemara asks another question: The verse states: <b>“He poured it out to the Lord”</b> (II Samuel 23:16), which indicates that David acted stringently and did not rely on the lenient ruling that he received. <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> either of <b>these two</b> explanations, that David asked either about burning the stacks of barley or about replacing their value with lentils, he poured out the water to God <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he acted for the sake of Heaven</b> and did not rely on the lenient ruling he had received. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that David asked about <b>a concealed</b> article damaged by <b>a fire, what</b> is the reason that <b>he poured out</b> the water <b>to the Lord?</b> The Gemara answers: The reason is <b>that they said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>in the name of the tradition,</b> without associating it with any specific individual.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one kindled a fire that <b>crossed a fence that is four cubits high, or</b> if the fire crossed <b>the public thoroughfare, or</b> if the fire crossed <b>a river,</b> and in each case it caused damage on the other side, he is <b>exempt</b> from liability.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if a fire <b>crossed a fence that is four cubits in height,</b> the one who kindled the fire is <b>liable?</b> This appears to contradict the mishna.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> There is no dispute between the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna and the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>; there is merely a difference of how they stated their rulings. <b>The <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>counts</b> downward <b>from above to below.</b> In other words, if the fire crossed a fence <b>six cubits</b> high, the one who kindled the fire is <b>exempt;</b> if it crossed a fence <b>five cubits</b> high, he is <b>exempt;</b> and this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>until</b> the fire crosses a fence of a minimum of <b>four cubits</b> high, where the one who kindled the fire is still <b>exempt.</b> Conversely, <b>the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> counts</b> up <b>from below to above.</b> The meaning is that if the fire crossed a fence <b>two cubits</b> high, the one who kindled the fire is <b>liable;</b> if the fire crossed a fence <b>three cubits</b> high, he is <b>liable;</b> and this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>until</b> the fire crosses a fence of a maximum of <b>four cubits</b> high, where the one who kindled the fire is still <b>liable.</b> Accordingly, there is no contradiction between the mishna and the <i>baraita</i>.
§ <b>Rava says: When they said</b> in the mishna with regard to a fire crossing a fence <b>four cubits</b> high <b>that</b> the one who kindled the fire is <b>exempt,</b> this is <b>even in a field of thorns. Rav Pappa says: And</b> Rava’s statement is referring to a case where the height of the fence <b>is four cubits</b> counting <b>from above the</b> upper <b>limit of the thorns.</b>
<b>Rav says: They taught</b> in the mishna that one is exempt from liability if the fire crosses a public thoroughfare <b>only in</b> a case where the flame <b>blazes high [<i>bekolaḥat</i>]. But in</b> a case where the flame <b>blazes low [<i>benikhpefet</i>]</b> and therefore spreads easily along the ground, the one who kindled the fire is <b>liable even</b> if the space that the fire crossed was <b>up to one hundred cubits. And Shmuel said: The mishna</b> exempts one from liability if the fire crosses a public thoroughfare <b>in</b> a case where the flame <b>blazes low, but in</b> a case where the flame <b>blazes high, even any</b> minimal gap between where the fire was kindled and where it caused damage renders the one who kindled the fire <b>exempt.</b>
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said</b> that one is exempt if the fire crosses a public thoroughfare? It is <b>in</b> a case where the flame <b>blazes high. But in</b> a case where the flame <b>blazes low and there is wood</b> to keep <b>it</b> burning, one is <b>liable even</b> if it causes damage at a distance of <b>up to one hundred <i>mil</i>.</b> If the fire <b>crossed a river or a pool [<i>shelulit</i>]</b> of water <b>that is eight cubits wide,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying for the damage caused, regardless of whether the fire blazed high or low.
§ The mishna teaches: If the fire crossed <b>the public thoroughfare,</b> he is exempt. The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i></b> who holds this opinion? <b>Rava said: It is Rabbi Eliezer, as we learned</b> in a mishna (61b) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One is liable up to a distance of <b>sixteen cubits, like</b> the width of <b>the public domain.</b> By inference, one is exempt if a fire crosses a greater distance, i.e., across a public thoroughfare.
The mishna teaches: <b>Or</b> if the fire crossed <b>a river,</b> he is exempt. <b>Rav says:</b> The term stream means <b>an actual river. And Shmuel says:</b> This term means <b>a water channel.</b>
The Gemara explains their dispute: <b>The one who says</b> that it is referring to <b>an actual river,</b> Rav, deems exempt one whose fire crosses a riverbed <b>even when there is no water</b> in it, since it is sufficiently deep and wide to prevent a typical fire from crossing it. <b>But the one who says</b> that it is referring to <b>a water channel,</b> Shmuel, holds that <b>if</b> the fire crosses a water channel that <b>has water in it, yes,</b> the one who kindled the fire is exempt. <b>But if</b> the fire crosses a water channel that <b>does not have water in it,</b> he is <b>not</b> exempt.
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Pe’a</i> 2:1): <b>And these,</b> the following list of features, <b>divide</b> a field <b>for the purpose of <i>pe’a</i>,</b> i.e., it is no longer considered a single field, but instead <i>pe’a</i> must be given from each separate section: <b>A stream, a <i>shelulit</i>, a private road, and a public thoroughfare.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>a <i>shelulit</i>? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> It is <b>a place where rainwater gathers [<i>sholelin</i>]. Rav Beivai says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says: It is <b>a water channel that distributes</b> its <b>spoils [<i>shalal</i>] to its banks,</b> since the water spreads to the adjacent cisterns.
The Gemara points out that according to the <b>one who says</b> that it means <b>a place where rainwater gathers,</b> Shmuel, since gathered rainwater divides a field, <b>all the more so</b> does <b>a water channel,</b> which is both larger and permanent, divide a field. <b>But</b> according to the <b>one who says</b> that only <b>a water channel</b> divides a field, Rabbi Yoḥanan, he holds that only that divides a field, <b>but a place where rainwater gathers does not divide</b> the field, <b>since these</b>

Daf 61b

<b>are</b> simply <b>called pools of the land,</b> and are not considered significant enough to divide the field.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>one who kindles</b> a fire <b>on his own</b> premises, <b>up to what</b> distance <b>may the fire travel</b> within his property for him to still bear liability for damage caused? <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria says:</b> The court <b>views his</b> location where he kindled the fire <b>as if it were in the center of a <i>beit kor</i>.</b> Therefore, if the fire spreads and causes damage farther away than half a <i>beit kor</i>, the one who kindled the fire is exempt, since he could not anticipate that the fire would spread so far. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One is liable up to a distance of <b>sixteen cubits, like</b> the width of <b>a public thoroughfare. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> One is liable up to a distance of <b>fifty cubits. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The verse states: <b>“The one who kindled the fire shall pay [<i>shallem yeshallem</i>] compensation”</b> (Exodus 22:5), to teach that <b>everything is according to the fire.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> Rabbi Shimon appears to hold that there is no maximum distance which would exempt one from liability for the spreading of a fire. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t Rabbi Shimon</b> of the opinion that there is a maximum <b>limit</b> concerning liability <b>for a fire,</b> beyond which one is exempt?
<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 20b): <b>A person may not stand an oven inside the house unless there is a height of four cubits</b> to the ceiling <b>above it,</b> out of concern that the ceiling might catch fire. Similarly, if <b>he stood it in the attic,</b> he should not do so <b>unless there is plaster [<i>ma’aziva</i>] underneath it,</b> above the ceiling of the floor below, <b>three handbreadths</b> in thickness, out of concern that the floor might catch fire. <b>And in the</b> case of <b>a stove,</b> which is smaller and does not reach temperatures as high as those of an oven, a thickness of one <b>handbreadth</b> is sufficient. <b>And</b> even though he may place his oven or stove in this manner, <b>if</b> the fire from the oven or stove <b>causes damage, he must pay</b> for <b>what it damaged.</b>
The mishna continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon says: These measurements were stated only</b> to teach <b>that if</b> the fire from the oven or stove <b>causes damage</b> after the owner takes these precautions, he is <b>exempt from paying</b> compensation. Evidently, Rabbi Shimon does have a maximum distance beyond which one is not liable for fire.
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> This is how Rabbi Shimon’s statement in the mishna should be understood: <b>Everything is according to the height of the fire</b> he initially kindled. If it was a small fire he is not liable to pay for damage caused by it if it traveled far, whereas if he started a large fire, he is liable even if it traveled a great distance.
<b>Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon. And so Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who kindles a stack</b> of wheat or barley <b>and there were vessels</b> concealed <b>inside</b> the stack <b>and they</b> caught fire and <b>burned</b> together with the stack, <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The one who kindled the fire also <b>pays</b> compensation <b>for what was inside</b> the stack, <b>but the Rabbis say: He pays</b> compensation <b>only</b> for <b>the stack of wheat or barley,</b> as the case may be, and he is not responsible for that which was concealed within it.
If <b>there was a goat tied to</b> the stack of grain, <b>and</b> there was a Canaanite <b>slave nearby</b> who was not tied to it, <b>and</b> both the goat and the slave <b>were burned</b> together <b>with</b> the stack and killed, the one who kindled the fire is <b>liable</b> to pay compensation for both. Conversely, if the <b>slave was tied</b> to the stack <b>and</b> there was <b>a goat nearby</b> that was not tied to it, <b>and</b> they were both <b>burned together with it,</b> the one who kindled the fire is <b>exempt</b> from payment for damage because he is liable to receive capital punishment for murder, and he is punished only for the greater transgression.
<b>And the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda and exempt one from payment for vessels concealed inside the stack in the field, <b>concede to Rabbi Yehuda</b> that if one <b>sets fire to a building,</b> he <b>pays</b> compensation <b>for everything that was</b> burned <b>inside it, since it is the</b> normal <b>way of people to place</b> items <b>in houses.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Kahana says:</b> This <b>dispute</b> between the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda concerning vessels concealed in a stack is referring specifically to a case <b>where one kindled</b> a fire <b>on his own</b> premises <b>and</b> the fire <b>spread and consumed</b> the stack <b>on another’s</b> property. In that case, <b>Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> the one who kindled the fire <b>liable for damage</b> to <b>concealed</b> articles damaged by <b>a fire, but the Rabbis exempt</b> him. <b>But in</b> a case of one who <b>kindles</b> a fire <b>on another’s</b> premises, <b>all agree</b> that <b>he pays</b> compensation for <b>everything that is</b> contained <b>within it.</b>
<b>Rava said to him: If so,</b> that the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Yehuda in the case of one who kindles the fire on the premises of another, then <b>rather than teaching the latter clause</b> that states: <b>The Rabbis concede to Rabbi Yehuda</b> that if one <b>sets fire to a building he pays</b> compensation <b>for everything</b> that was burned <b>inside it, since it is the</b> normal <b>way of people to place</b> items <b>in houses, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> instead <b>distinguish and teach</b> the concession of the Rabbis <b>in</b> the context of <b>the same</b> case of one setting fire to a stack: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where he kindled the fire on his own</b> premises <b>and it spread and consumed</b> a stack <b>on</b> the premises of <b>another. But if he kindled</b> the fire <b>on</b> property belonging to <b>another, all agree that he pays</b> compensation <b>for everything that was</b> contained <b>within it.</b> Since the mishna is not worded in this manner, it seems that this is not the opinion of the Rabbis.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree with regard to two</b> issues: <b>They disagree</b> with regard to the case of one who <b>kindles a fire on his own</b> premises <b>and</b> it then <b>spreads and consumes</b> a stack <b>on</b> property belonging to <b>another, as Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> him <b>liable</b> even <b>for a concealed</b> article damaged by <b>a fire, but the Rabbis hold</b> that he is <b>not liable. And they disagree also</b> in the case of one <b>who kindles a fire on</b> premises belonging to <b>another, as Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that he must <b>pay</b> compensation <b>for everything within it, even a purse</b> of money if it was concealed within the stack, <b>but the Rabbis hold</b> that it is only for <b>vessels that are typically concealed inside a stack, such as threshing tools or yokes for cattle, that he must pay</b> compensation, but for <b>vessels</b> or other items <b>that are not typically concealed inside a stack</b> he is <b>not</b> liable to <b>pay</b> compensation.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to one <b>who kindles a stack and there were vessels inside it</b> that were <b>burned, Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The one who kindled the fire <b>pays</b> compensation <b>for everything that was inside it, but the Rabbis say: He pays</b> compensation only for the value of <b>a stack of wheat or a stack of barley,</b> and he does not pay compensation for the vessels. <b>And</b> the court <b>views the place</b> where <b>the vessels</b> were <b>as if it were filled with grain,</b> and calculates the amount of compensation accordingly.

Daf 62a

<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is in a case where one <b>kindled a fire on his</b> premises <b>and</b> the fire <b>spread and burned</b> items <b>in</b> premises belonging to <b>another. But</b> with regard to one who <b>kindles a fire on</b> premises belonging to <b>another</b> that destroys a stack of wheat, <b>all agree</b> that <b>he pays</b> compensation for <b>everything that was inside</b> the stack.
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda concedes to the Rabbis that in</b> a case where one <b>lends space to another</b> in his field <b>to stack grain, and</b> this person <b>stacked</b> grain in the field <b>and concealed</b> items inside the stack, if the owner of the field causes the stack to be burned down, <b>he pays compensation for the stack alone,</b> since the other person did not have permission to conceal items inside his stack. Similarly, if one received permission <b>to stack wheat</b> in the field of another <b>and he stacked barley;</b> or conversely, if he received permission to stack <b>barley and he stacked wheat;</b> or similarly, if he stacked <b>wheat and covered</b> the stack <b>with barley,</b> or stacked <b>barley and covered</b> the stack <b>with wheat,</b> in all these cases, Rabbi Yehuda concedes <b>that he pays compensation for</b> the <b>barley alone,</b> which is less than the value of wheat.
§ <b>Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>one who gives a gold dinar to a woman</b> for safekeeping <b>and says to her: Be careful with this</b> dinar because <b>it is</b> made of <b>silver,</b> if <b>she</b> herself <b>damaged</b> the dinar, <b>she must pay</b> compensation for the value of <b>a gold dinar.</b> This is <b>because he</b> can <b>say to her: What</b> business <b>did you have damaging it?</b> If <b>she was negligent</b> and it was lost or stolen, <b>she pays</b> as compensation only the value of <b>a silver</b> dinar, <b>since she</b> can <b>say to him: I undertook to safeguard only a silver</b> dinar, <b>but I did not undertake to safeguard a gold</b> dinar.
<b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: You teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> as a statement <b>of Rava,</b> but for <b>us</b> this <i>halakha</i> is <b>obvious from the <i>baraita</i></b> that taught: If one stacked <b>wheat and covered</b> the stack <b>with barley,</b> or stacked <b>barley and covered</b> the stack <b>with wheat,</b> the one responsible for the fire <b>pays compensation for the barley alone. Evidently,</b> the one who kindled the fire can <b>say to</b> the owner of the stack: <b>I undertook to safeguard</b> a stack of <b>barley</b> but not a stack of wheat. <b>Here too,</b> in the case of a golden dinar presented as a silver dinar, <b>the</b> woman <b>can say to him: I did not undertake to safeguard a gold</b> dinar.
§ <b>Rav said: I heard</b> a halakhic <b>matter</b> in connection <b>with Rabbi Yehuda’s</b> opinion in the mishna <b>but I do not know what it is. Shmuel said: And does Abba,</b> which was Rav’s name, really <b>not know what he heard?</b> This is the statement that he heard: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who deems</b> one <b>liable for concealed</b> articles damaged by <b>a fire,</b> the Sages <b>applied the ordinance of a robbery victim to</b> one whose concealed items are damaged by <b>his fire.</b> Just as the Sages instituted an ordinance that a robbery victim can take an oath as to what was stolen from him and the robber must repay him accordingly, similarly, according to Rabbi Yehuda the owner of the stack can take an oath that certain items were inside the stack, and the one responsible for the fire must pay compensation for them.
<b>Ameimar asks:</b> Did <b>they apply</b> this <b>ordinance of a robbery victim in</b> the case of <b>an informer</b> who causes another person’s property to be confiscated by the gentile authorities, <b>or not?</b> The question is clarified: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says</b> that <b>we do not judge</b> cases of <b>liability</b> for damage caused by <b>indirect</b> action, <b>do not ask</b> the question, <b>as</b> according to that opinion <b>we also do not judge</b> cases <b>of</b> liability for <b>informers</b> who cause indirect damage.
<b>Rather, when you ask</b> this question, <b>it is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the one who said</b> that <b>we judge</b> cases of <b>liability</b> for damage caused by <b>indirect</b> action, and the question is: Did the Sages <b>apply the ordinance of a robbery victim to</b> one whose items were taken due to an <b>informer,</b> meaning <b>that</b> the victim <b>can take an oath</b> to support his claim with regard to what was taken <b>and take</b> this amount in compensation, <b>or not?</b> No conclusion was reached about this, and the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
An incident was related about <b>a certain man who kicked a safe belonging to another, sending it</b> flying <b>into the river. The owner</b> of the safe <b>came</b> to court <b>and said: I had such and such inside it. Rav Ashi sat and was investigating</b> the question: <b>In a case like this, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does the court believe the claimant or not?
<b>Ravina said to Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, and some say</b> that <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: Is this not</b> identical to the case of <b>the mishna, as we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>And the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Yehuda</b> that if one <b>sets fire to a building, he pays</b> compensation <b>for everything that was</b> burned <b>inside it, since it is the</b> normal <b>way of people to place</b> items <b>in houses?</b> Similarly, it is the normal way of people to place money in a safe, and the court should rely on the claim of the victim.
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: If</b> the claimant <b>were to claim</b> that there were <b>coins</b> in the safe, this ruling would apply <b>here also.</b> But <b>with what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the claimant <b>claims</b> that there was <b>a pearl [<i>marganita</i>]</b> in the safe. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do people</b> typically <b>place pearls in a safe,</b> in which case he should be believed, <b>or not?</b> The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi:</b> If the one whose home was burned by the fire were to <b>claim</b> that he had, among other items, <b>a silver goblet in the building, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is he believed or not? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: We view</b> his situation. <b>If he is a wealthy person, who</b> would typically <b>have a silver goblet, or alternatively, if he is a trustworthy person with whom people entrust</b> valuable items, he <b>can take an oath</b> that this is what he had <b>and take</b> compensation according to his claim. <b>But if</b> he is <b>not</b> such a person, it <b>is not in his</b> power to be believed in such a claim.
§ <b>Rav Adda, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi:</b> Concerning two terms used to describe those who take another’s property against his will, <b>a <i>gazlan</i> and a <i>ḥamsan</i>, what</b> is the difference <b>between them?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: A <i>ḥamsan</i> gives money</b> for the article that he takes from its owner, albeit against the owner’s will, whereas <b>a <i>gazlan</i> does not give money.</b>
Rav Adda was puzzled by this response and <b>said to him: If he gives money, do you</b> still <b>call him a <i>ḥamsan</i>?</b> Since he pays money for it, he acquires it lawfully, despite the fact that its owner did not sell it voluntarily. <b>But doesn’t Rav Huna say:</b> If one was <b>strung up</b> so that another could coerce him to sell a certain item, <b>and he sold</b> it, <b>his sale is</b> a valid <b>sale.</b> This indicates that a sale under duress is considered a valid sale. Rav Ashi answered: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> case, where the sale under duress is legally considered to be a sale, is referring to a case <b>where he</b> eventually <b>says: I want</b> to sell the item, despite having been forced. By contrast, in <b>that</b> case, where the sale is invalid, <b>he did not say: I want</b> to sell the item.

Daf 62b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>a spark that emerged from under the hammer</b> of a blacksmith and started a fire, <b>causing damage,</b> the blacksmith is <b>liable</b> for the damage caused.
In the case of <b>a camel that was laden with flax and was passing through the public domain, and its flax extended into a store and</b> the flax <b>caught fire from a lamp</b> in the store <b>belonging to the storekeeper, and</b> as a result of the burning flax the camel <b>set fire to the building</b> together with all its contents, <b>the owner of the camel</b> is <b>liable.</b> But if <b>the storekeeper placed his lamp outside,</b> thereby causing the flax on the camel to catch fire, and consequently the building was set on fire, <b>the storekeeper</b> is <b>liable. Rabbi Yehuda says: In</b> a case where the lamp placed outside was <b>a Hanukkah lamp,</b> the storekeeper is <b>exempt,</b> since it is a mitzva for a Hanukkah lamp to be placed outside.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ravina said in the name of Rava: Conclude from Rabbi Yehuda’s</b> statement that <b>the mitzva is to place the Hanukkah lamp within</b> a height of <b>ten</b> handbreadths from the ground <b>as, if it enters your mind</b> to say that the mitzva can also be fulfilled by placing it <b>above ten handbreadths, why did Rabbi Yehuda say that</b> in the case of <b>a Hanukkah lamp</b> placed outside, the storekeeper is <b>exempt? Let</b> the owner of the camel <b>say to</b> the storekeeper: <b>You should have placed</b> the lamp <b>above the</b> height <b>of a camel and its rider</b> so that the flax would not catch fire. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> here that Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion is that <b>the mitzva is to place it within ten handbreadths</b> of the ground and not higher?
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>No,</b> there is no proof from here. <b>Actually, I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that one may place a Hanukkah lamp <b>even above</b> a height of <b>ten</b> handbreadths, and as for <b>what you said,</b> that the owner of the camel can claim: <b>You should have placed</b> the lamp <b>above</b> the height <b>of a camel and its rider,</b> in response to this one can say: <b>Since</b> the store owner <b>is performing a mitzva</b> by placing his Hanukkah lamp outside, <b>the Sages did not trouble him to such an extent</b> to have him place his lamp at a height that would be inconvenient for him to reach.
Further on the subject of the height of a Hanukkah lamp, <b>Rav Kahana says</b> that <b>Rav Natan bar Minyumi taught in the name of Rabbi Tanḥum: A Hanukkah lamp that is placed higher than twenty cubits</b> from the ground is <b>unfit</b> to be used for the mitzva, since people do not generally look up to such a height, and the main purpose of the Hanukkah lamp is for it to be seen by others. In this regard, the <i>halakha</i> of the height of a Hanukkah lamp is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the height of <b>a <i>sukka</i> and</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the height of a cross beam at the entrance to <b>an alleyway,</b> which are unfit for their respective purposes if they are higher than twenty cubits.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>The principle of double payment</b> applies <b>more broadly than the principle of fourfold or fivefold payment, as the principle of double payment applies both to</b> the theft of <b>something that is alive and to</b> the theft of <b>something that is not alive, but the principle of fourfold or fivefold payment applies only to</b> the theft of <b>an ox or a sheep, as it is stated: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, and slaughter it or sell it,</b> he shall pay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep” (Exodus 21:37).
Having stated a limitation to the <i>halakha</i> of fourfold and fivefold payment, the mishna mentions a further limitation, which applies to all three types of payments. <b>One who steals</b> an item <b>after a thief</b> has already stolen it, i.e., one who steals a stolen item, <b>does not pay</b> the <b>double payment</b> to the thief or to the prior owner, <b>nor does one who slaughters or sells</b> an ox or a sheep <b>after a thief</b> has already stolen it <b>pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> Rather, he pays only the principal, i.e., the value of the item he stole.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches one particular difference between double payment and fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>while it does not teach</b> this difference between them: <b>The principle of double payment applies both in</b> the case of <b>a thief and in</b> the case of a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit entrusted to him and who takes an oath to that effect. <b>But the principle of fourfold or fivefold payment applies only in</b> the case of <b>a thief,</b> not in the case of one who falsely claims that a deposit was stolen.
The fact that the mishna does not teach the latter distinction <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of <b>one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole a <b>deposit</b> from him, and it is discovered that he himself is the thief, he <b>pays double payment.</b> And if the stolen item is an ox or sheep and <b>he slaughtered or sold</b> it, <b>he pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> According to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, there is no difference between the applications of double payment and fourfold or fivefold payment in this case.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this discussion: <b>Let us say</b> that the mishna <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba, as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of <b>one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole a <b>deposit</b> from him, and it is discovered that he himself is the thief, he <b>pays double payment.</b> And if the stolen item is an ox or sheep, and <b>he slaughtered or sold</b> it, <b>he pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
The Gemara rejects the inference: <b>Does</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that <b>there is no</b> difference <b>between</b> double payment and fourfold or fivefold payment except for the one mentioned in the mishna? <b>It teaches</b> merely that the principle of double payment applies <b>more broadly</b> than the principle of fourfold or fivefold payment, and it provides an example of this statement. This does not mean that this is the only difference, and it is possible that the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> this one case <b>and omitted</b> others.
§ The mishna teaches <b>that the principle of double payment applies</b> both to the theft of something that is alive and to the theft of something that is not alive. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse that discusses double payment: “For any matter of trespass, whether it be for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment, or for any manner of lost thing about which one shall say: This is it, the claims of both of them shall come before the judges, the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8). <b>“For any matter of trespass”</b> is <b>a generalization; “whether it be for an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> And when the verse states: <b>“Or for any manner of lost thing,” it then generalizes</b> again.
Consequently, this verse contains <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization,</b> and one of the thirteen rules of exegesis states that in such a case <b>you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail.</b> Therefore, <b>just as</b> each of the items mentioned in <b>the detail</b> is clearly <b>defined as an item that is movable property and</b> has <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value, <b>so too</b> double payment is practiced with regard to <b>any item that is movable property and</b> has <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value.
<b>Land is excluded, as it is not movable property.</b> Canaanite <b>slaves are excluded, as they are compared to land</b> in many areas of <i>halakha</i>. Financial <b>documents are excluded, as, although they are movable property, they do not</b> have <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value. The value of the material on which the document is written is negligible; documents are valuable only because they serve as proof for monetary claims. Finally, <b>consecrated</b> property <b>is excluded</b> because <b>it is written</b> in the verse that the one found liable shall pay double to <b>“his neighbor,”</b> i.e., to another person, rather than to the Temple treasury.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> of double payment is limited to cases similar to the details mentioned in the verse, it should also be derived that <b>just as</b> each of the items mentioned in <b>the detail</b> is clearly <b>defined as an item whose carcass transmits impurity through contact and carrying, so too any item whose carcass transmits impurity through contact and carrying</b> it is subject to double payment. <b>But birds,</b> whose carcasses do not transmit impurity through contact or carrying, should <b>not</b> be subject to double payment.
The Gemara objects to the question: <b>But how can you say this? But isn’t “garment” written</b> in the list of specified items (Exodus 22:8)? It is impossible to speak of the impurity of carcasses with regard to clothing. The Gemara responds: <b>Say,</b> in response to this objection: <b>We are speaking</b> specifically <b>of animals,</b> and this is the question that was asked: Why not <b>say</b> that <b>with regard to animals,</b> an animal <b>whose carcass transmits impurity through contact and carrying, yes,</b> it is subject to double payment, whereas an animal <b>whose carcass does not transmit impurity through contact and carrying,</b> such as a bird, <b>no,</b> a thief would not pay double payment for stealing it?

Daf 63a

This line of reasoning is correct, <b>because we expound each one</b> of the listed items in the <b>generalization, and detail,</b> and generalization <b>by itself.</b> Each item is treated individually as representing a category, but the different items are not grouped together into one broad category. Since several animals are listed, it is concluded that if the stolen item is an animal it must resemble the listed animals. <b>But</b> since <b>birds</b> do not transmit impurity through contact or carrying, they are <b>not</b> subject to double payment.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>If so, let the Merciful One write</b> just <b>one detail,</b> i.e., animal, and that would have been enough to teach that animals are subject to double payment only if they transmit impurity through contact and carrying, so birds are excluded. Since the Torah listed several animals, birds are included.
The Gemara questions this assertion: <b>Which</b> individual animal <b>should the Merciful One have written? If the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>“ox,” I would say</b> that only an animal that is similar to an ox, in that it <b>is sacrificed on the altar, yes,</b> it is subject to double payment. But an animal <b>that is not sacrificed on the altar, no,</b> it is not subject to double payment. <b>And if the Merciful One had written</b> only <b>“donkey,” I would say</b> that only an animal that is similar to a donkey, in that its firstborn male offspring is <b>sacred with</b> the sanctity of <b>a firstborn, yes,</b> it is subject to double payment. But an animal that is <b>not sacred with</b> the sanctity of <b>a firstborn, no,</b> it is not subject to double payment. The principle of double payment would then include cattle, sheep, goats, and donkeys, but not other animals (see Exodus 13:13 and Deuteronomy 15:19).
The Gemara responds: <b>Say</b> in answer to this question: <b>If so,</b> if the Torah had wished to limit double payment to cases where cattle, sheep, goats, or donkeys were stolen, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> just <b>“ox” and “donkey”; why do I</b> need the verse to mention <b>“sheep”? Conclude from it</b> that the Torah intends <b>to include</b> even animals that do not meet these criteria, e.g., <b>birds.</b>
The Gemara asks further: <b>But say</b> that the verse mentions sheep in order <b>to include</b> only <b>kosher birds,</b> which are <b>similar to</b> the <b>sheep</b> listed in the verse, in <b>that</b> a carcass of these birds <b>renders</b> both the one who eats it and his <b>garments</b> ritually <b>impure</b> when it passes through his <b>esophagus,</b> as the carcass of a sheep also transmits ritual impurity. <b>But non-kosher birds, whose</b> carcasses <b>do not have ritual impurity</b> at all, <b>as they do not render</b> either the one who eats them or his <b>garments impure</b> when they pass through his <b>esophagus, no,</b> they are not subject to double payment. The Gemara answers: The word <b>“any [<i>kol</i>],”</b> in the phrase “for any [<i>kol</i>] matter of trespass” is <b>an amplification,</b> and serves to include even non-kosher birds in the principle of double payment.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is it so that <b>anywhere that</b> the Torah <b>wrote</b> the word <b><i>kol</i> it is an amplification? But isn’t it</b> so that <b>with regard to</b> second <b>tithe,</b> the word <b><i>kol</i> is written</b> in the verse: “And you shall bestow the money for whatever [<i>bekhol</i>] your soul desires, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink, or for whatever your soul asks of you” (Deuteronomy 14:26)? <b>And</b> yet <b>we expound</b> that verse <b>as a generalization, and a detail,</b> and a generalization.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And you shall bestow the money for whatever your soul desires,”</b> is <b>a generalization,</b> as no particular type of food is specified. <b>“For oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink,”</b> is a <b>detail,</b> as specific types of food are mentioned. When the verse concludes with <b>“or for whatever your soul asks of you,” it has generalized again.</b> Since the verse is formulated as <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail.</b> This indicates that <b>just as</b> each of the items mentioned in <b>the detail</b> is clearly <b>defined as the produce of produce,</b> i.e., they grow from a parent organism, e.g., agricultural produce or animals, <b>and</b> they are <b>grown from the ground,</b> i.e., their sustenance comes from the ground, <b>so too</b> the category of items one may purchase with second-tithe money includes <b>all</b> items that are <b>the produce of produce and are grown from the ground.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>Say</b> in answer to this question that the term <b><i>bekhol</i></b> is <b>a generalization,</b> whereas the term <b><i>kol</i> is an amplification. And if you wish, say</b> an alternate answer: The word <b><i>kol</i></b> is usually <b>a generalization. But</b> the word <b><i>kol</i> that is</b> written <b>here,</b> in the verse concerning double payment (Exodus 22:8), is an exception. It is regarded as <b>an amplification,</b> as the Gemara will explain.
<b>After all,</b> there is another <b>generalization, and a detail, and a generalization written at the beginning</b> of this passage, <b>as it is written:</b> “If a man gives his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard and it was stolen from the house of the man, if the thief shall be found he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). <b>“If a man gives his neighbor”</b> is <b>a generalization. “Money or vessels” is a detail.</b> When the verse concludes <b>“to safeguard,” it has generalized again.</b>
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>this</b> later verse: <b>“For any matter of trespass”</b> (Exodus 22:8), <b>is also coming</b> to state <b>a generalization, and a detail,</b> and a generalization, <b>let the Merciful One write these details,</b> i.e., ox, donkey, sheep, and garment, which are cited in the later verse, <b>together with that</b> previous <b>generalization, and detail,</b> and generalization. <b>Why do I</b> need the latter verse beginning with <b>“for any matter of trespass”? Conclude from it</b> that the word <i>kol</i> <b>is an amplification</b> in this instance, and it includes all animals.
The Gemara asks: <b>Now that you said</b> that the word <b><i>kol</i></b> is <b>an amplification, why do I</b> need <b>all these details</b> listed in the verse, i.e., ox, donkey, sheep, and garment? The Gemara answers: As for the three animals listed, <b>one</b> is mentioned <b>to exclude land, one to exclude</b> Canaanite <b>slaves, and one to exclude</b> financial <b>documents.</b> The example of <b>a garment</b> is mentioned <b>to exclude an item that is not</b> clearly <b>delineated</b> in size or quantity. <b>“Or for any manner of lost thing”</b> is written <b>to</b> teach that <b>which Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole

Daf 63b

<b>a lost item</b> that he had found, which he had been obligated to safeguard until it could be returned to its owner, <b>he pays double payment, as it is stated: “For any manner of lost thing about which one shall say:</b> This is it…the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8).
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (108b) about a case where an owner of an item said to the bailee: <b>Where is my deposit?</b> The bailee <b>said to him:</b> It <b>was lost.</b> The owner said: <b>I administer an oath to you</b> that it was actually lost, <b>and</b> the bailee <b>said: Amen,</b> thereby accepting the oath; <b>and</b> subsequently <b>the witnesses testify about</b> the bailee <b>that he</b> himself <b>consumed</b> the deposit. In this case, the bailee <b>pays the principal,</b> i.e., the value of the deposit, to the owner. If the bailee <b>admitted on his own</b> that he stole the deposit before any witnesses testified to this effect, <b>he pays the principal and</b> an additional <b>one-fifth</b> of the principal amount to the owner, <b>and</b> he brings <b>a guilt-offering</b> to atone for his sin (see Leviticus 5:20–26).
The mishna continues with another case: The owner said to the bailee: <b>Where is my deposit?</b> The bailee <b>said to him: It was stolen.</b> The owner said: <b>I administer an oath to you, and</b> the bailee <b>said: Amen; and the witnesses testify about</b> the bailee <b>that he stole</b> the deposit. In this case, the bailee <b>pays double payment.</b> If he <b>admitted</b> his theft <b>on his own, he pays the principal and</b> an additional <b>one-fifth</b> to the owner, <b>and</b> he brings <b>a guilt-offering</b> to atone for his sin.
The Gemara says: <b>In any event,</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that <b>in</b> the case of a bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, <b>he pays double payment, but in</b> the case of a bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>claims that</b> a deposit <b>was lost, he does not pay double payment. And</b> it also teaches that <b>even</b> with regard to <b>one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, it is only <b>by</b> taking <b>an oath</b> to substantiate his claim <b>that he pays double payment, but</b> for simply lying <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath he does not pay double payment.</b>
<b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah states: “If a man gives his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard and it was stolen from the house of the man, <b>if the thief shall be found</b> he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). <b>The verse is speaking of</b> a bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: Do <b>you say</b> that the verse is speaking <b>about one who</b> falsely <b>claims that</b> a deposit <b>was stolen, or is it</b> speaking <b>only about the thief himself,</b> teaching that if the actual thief is caught he must pay double payment? <b>When</b> the Torah <b>says</b> in the following verse: <b>“If the thief shall not be found</b>…the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:7–8), <b>the verse is speaking of one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, as it states that no other thief was found. Since the latter verse is speaking of one who falsely claims that a deposit was stolen, it stands to reason that the earlier verse is speaking of this case as well.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: When the Torah states: <b>“If the thief shall be found</b> he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6), <b>the verse is speaking of the thief himself.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that it is speaking <b>about the thief himself, or is it</b> speaking <b>only about one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole? If so, then <b>when</b> the verse then <b>says: “If the thief shall not be found</b>…the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:7–8), the case of <b>one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit <b>is</b> already <b>stated. How,</b> then, <b>do I realize</b> the first verse about paying double: <b>“If the thief shall be found,”</b> so that it not be superfluous? It must be that <b>the</b> first <b>verse is speaking of the thief himself.</b>
The Gemara comments: Although the two <i>baraitot</i> disagree about the meaning of the earlier verse, <b>in any event everyone</b> agrees that the latter verse, which states: <b>“If the thief be not found [<i>im lo yimmatze hagannav</i>]</b>…shall pay double to his neighbor,” is referring to a bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit. <b>From where</b> is this interpretation <b>inferred</b> from the verse? <b>Rava said</b> that the verse should be understood as follows: <b>If it is not found [<i>im lo yimmatze</i>]</b> to be <b>as he said,</b> i.e., if his claim that the deposit was stolen is found to be untrue, <b>but he himself stole it, he shall pay double</b> to his neighbor.
The Gemara turns its attention to another facet of this <i>halakha</i>: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> this double payment of one who falsely claims that the deposit was stolen applies only <b>when</b> the bailee has taken <b>an oath</b> that it was stolen?
The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “If the thief shall not be found, <b>the homeowner shall approach the judges</b> to determine if he laid his hand [<i>shalaḥ yado</i>] on his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:7). This means that he shall come to court <b>for</b> the purpose of taking <b>an oath.</b> Do <b>you say</b> he comes to court <b>for</b> the purpose of taking <b>an oath, or is it only for</b> the purpose of facing <b>judgment?</b> The meaning may be determined by means of a verbal analogy. <b>Laying</b> the <b>hand [<i>shliḥut yad</i>],</b> referring to misappropriation, <b>is stated later,</b> in the verse: “The oath of the Lord shall be between them both, to see whether he has not laid his hand [<i>shalaḥ yado</i>] on his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:10), <b>and laying the hand is stated above,</b> i.e., Exodus 22:7. <b>Just as laying</b> the <b>hand later</b> is referring explicitly <b>to an oath, so too</b> laying the hand <b>here</b> is referring <b>to an oath.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the two <i>baraitot</i> cited earlier: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> in the second <i>baraita</i> that <b>one</b> verse about double payment is speaking <b>about</b> the <b>thief and one</b> verse is speaking <b>about</b> a bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, <b>this is</b> why <b>two verses are written,</b> as each verse teaches a different <i>halakha</i>. <b>But according to the one who says</b> in the first <i>baraita</i> that <b>both</b> of the verses <b>are</b> speaking <b>about</b> a bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, <b>why do I</b> need <b>two verses?</b> One verse should be sufficient.
The Sages <b>say:</b> Both verses are necessary because <b>one</b> verse serves <b>to exclude</b> from double payment the case of one who falsely states <b>the claim</b> that the item has been <b>lost.</b> Double payment is paid only when the bailee falsely claims that the item under his care was stolen.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>one</b> verse is speaking <b>about the thief and one</b> verse is speaking <b>about</b> a bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, so that <b>there is no superfluous</b> verse, <b>from where does he</b> learn <b>to exclude</b> from double payment a bailee who falsely states <b>the claim</b> that the item has been <b>lost?</b> The Gemara answers: He derives it <b>from</b> the fact that the verse could have stated: If <b>a thief [<i>gannav</i>]</b> shall not be found, but it states instead: “If <b>the thief [<i>hagannav</i>]</b> shall not be found.”
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> since <b>according to the one who says</b> that <b>both</b> verses are speaking <b>about</b> a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit one of the verses <b>excludes</b> the case of a bailee who falsely <b>claims that</b> the deposit <b>was lost, what does he derive</b> from the fact that the verse did not state: If <b>a thief</b> shall not be found, but it states instead: “If <b>the thief</b> shall not be found”?
The Gemara answers: <b>He</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that this terminology <b>is necessary to</b> teach <b>what Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> One who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the <b>deposit pays double payment,</b> and if the deposit was an ox or sheep and <b>he slaughtered or sold</b> it, <b>he pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>According to the one who says</b> that <b>one</b> verse is speaking <b>about a thief and one</b> verse is speaking <b>about</b> a bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, <b>who employed this</b> change in terminology, i.e., the fact that the verse could have stated: If <b>a thief</b> shall not be found, but states instead: “If <b>the thief</b> shall not be found,” <b>to exclude</b> the case of a bailee who falsely states the <b>claim that</b> the deposit was <b>lost,</b> there seems to be no source to teach the <i>halakha</i> stated by Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba. Accordingly, <b>from where does he</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> taught by <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba,</b> that if the bailee slaughtered or sold the animal he pays a fourfold or fivefold payment?
The Gemara answers: He could have <b>said to you: It is a juxtaposition,</b> as liability for double payment for a thief and for a bailee who falsely claims that the deposit was stolen are juxtaposed to each other. Therefore, just as a thief pays a fourfold or fivefold payment if he slaughtered or sold the animal, so must the bailee. <b>And</b> although these two cases are not entirely comparable, this derivation cannot be refuted on that basis, as there is a principle that <b>one cannot refute</b> a derivation based on <b>juxtaposition</b> by drawing distinctions between the two juxtaposed cases.
The Gemara asks further: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <b>one</b> verse is speaking <b>about the thief and one</b> verse is speaking <b>about</b> a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, it is <b>well. But according to the one who says that both</b> verses are speaking <b>about</b> a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, <b>from where does he</b> derive that <b>a thief himself</b> must pay double payment for stealing?
<b>And if you would say: Let it be derived by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of the bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, because if one is obligated to pay double payment for falsely claiming that a deposit was stolen, which constitutes passive theft, all the more so must a thief himself pay double payment, this derivation is not possible. The reason is that <b>it is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source.</b> In other words, a <i>halakha</i> derived by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference cannot be more stringent than the <i>halakha</i> of the source from which it is derived. Consequently, on the basis of this <i>a fortiori</i> inference, it would have to be concluded that <b>just as there,</b> in the source case, the double payment is required only when the guilty party took <b>an oath, so too here,</b> when the thief himself pays double, it is only when he took <b>an oath</b> that he did not steal it.
The Gemara responds: <b>He derives</b> the obligation of a thief to pay double payment without having taken an oath from a third verse: “If the theft shall be found in his possession alive, whether it is an ox, or a donkey, or a sheep, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:3). The double payment in this verse applies to all items, as is derived <b>from what the school of Ḥizkiyya taught. As the school of Ḥizkiyya taught: Let</b> the verse <b>state</b> only <b>“ox” and “theft,” and all</b> items <b>would be included.</b> Why was it necessary to also mention “donkey” and “sheep”?
<b>Had</b> the verse had been written <b>this</b> way <b>I would have said: Just as</b> the item mentioned in <b>the detail</b> is clearly <b>defined as</b> an item that <b>is sacrificed on the altar, so too everything that is sacrificed on the altar</b> is subject to double payment, but other items are not. <b>What</b> else <b>is there for you to include</b> in this category? <b>Sheep,</b> which, like oxen, can be sacrificed on the altar.

Daf 64a

<b>When</b> the verse <b>states “sheep,” a sheep is thereby stated</b> explicitly. Therefore, the detail of “ox” cannot be written to include specifically items that can be sacrificed on the altar, e.g., a sheep. <b>How</b> then <b>do I realize</b> the meaning of the word <b>“theft,”</b> i.e., what is the category of items derived from the detail and generalization? It must be that it serves <b>to include all</b> types of <b>items</b> in the requirement of double payment.
The <i>baraita</i> continues to analyze the verse: <b>Let</b> the verse <b>state</b> only <b>“ox,” “sheep,” and “theft,” and</b> in that manner <b>everything</b> would be <b>included.</b> Why is it necessary to write “donkey”? <b>Had</b> the verse been written in <b>this</b> manner, without “donkey,” <b>I would have said: Just as</b> the items mentioned in <b>the detail,</b> “ox” and “sheep,” are clearly <b>defined as items that are</b> subject to being <b>sacred with</b> the sanctity of the <b>firstborn, so too any item that is</b> subject to being <b>sacred with</b> the sanctity of the <b>firstborn</b> is subject to double payment, but not other items.
<b>What is there for you to include</b> in this category? <b>A donkey. When</b> the verse <b>says “donkey,” a donkey is thereby stated</b> explicitly. Therefore, the details of “ox” and “sheep” cannot be written to include specifically items that are subject to being sacred with the sanctity of the firstborn, e.g., a donkey. <b>How</b> then <b>do I realize</b> the meaning of the word <b>“theft,”</b> i.e., what is the category of items derived from the detail and generalization? It must be that it serves <b>to include all</b> types of <b>items</b> in the requirement of double payment.
The <i>baraita</i> continues to analyze the verse: <b>Let</b> the verse <b>state</b> only <b>“ox,” and “donkey,”</b> and <b>“sheep,” and “theft,” and</b> in that manner <b>all</b> items <b>would be included.</b> Why is it necessary to write the word “alive”? <b>Had</b> the verse been written in <b>this</b> manner, <b>I would say: Just as</b> the items mentioned in <b>the detail,</b> “ox,” “sheep,” and “donkey,” are clearly <b>defined as</b> items that are <b>animals, so too all animals</b> are subject to double payment, but not inanimate objects.
<b>What is there for you to include</b> in this category that is not already listed? <b>Animals other</b> than oxen, sheep, and donkeys. <b>When</b> the verse <b>states</b> the term <b>“alive,” animals are thereby stated</b> explicitly. Therefore, the details of “ox,” “sheep,” and “donkey” cannot be written to include animals. <b>How</b> then <b>do I realize</b> the meaning of <b>“theft,”</b> i.e., what is the category of items derived from the detail and generalization? It must be that it serves <b>to include all</b> types of <b>items</b> in the requirement of double payment. This is the end of the <i>baraita</i>.
There are several puzzling elements of the halakhic exposition of the verse in this <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara now seeks to explain it in detail. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> above: <b>Let</b> the verse <b>state</b> only <b>“ox” and “theft.”</b> The Gemara objects: <b>Are “ox” and “theft” written</b> in the verse in this order, as a generalization and a detail? No, <b>it is “theft” and</b> then <b>“ox” that is written.</b> Consequently, the verse contains a generalization and a detail, in which case the generalization is understood to refer only to that which is specified in the detail.
<b>And if you would say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying</b> that this would be the case <b>had</b> the verse <b>stated</b> the words in this manner, i.e.: <b>Had</b> the verse <b>stated “ox” and</b> then <b>“theft,”</b> all items would have been included; <b>how can you</b> then proceed to <b>say: Just as</b> the item mentioned in <b>the detail,</b> “ox,” is clearly <b>defined as</b> an item that can be sacrificed on the altar, so too everything that can be sacrificed on the altar is subject to double payment? <b>“Ox” is a detail and “theft” is a generalization,</b> and according to the rules of hermeneutics, in such a case <b>the generalization adds to the detail, and all items are included,</b> not just items that resemble the detailed item.
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must be <b>saying</b> that the verse should be analyzed <b>as it is</b> actually <b>written:</b> First <b>“theft” and</b> then <b>“ox.”</b> Accordingly, <b>how can you</b> then proceed to <b>say</b> that <b>all</b> items <b>would be included, or: Just as</b> the item mentioned in <b>the detail</b> is clearly <b>defined as</b> an item that can be sacrificed on the altar, as the <i>baraita</i> states? This analysis is applicable only when there is a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization. In this verse <b>“theft” is a generalization and “ox”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> The rules of hermeneutics state that when there is only <b>a generalization and a detail, there is nothing</b> included <b>in the generalization other than what is</b> listed <b>in the detail.</b> In this case, one would necessarily conclude that if one steals <b>an ox, yes,</b> he is liable to pay the double payment for stealing it, but if one steals <b>anything else, no,</b> there is no double payment.
<b>Rava stated</b> an explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: When <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> suggested: Let the verse say “ox” and “theft,” and similar suggestions, <b>he was relying on</b> the word <b>“alive”</b> at the end of the phrase. He considered this word an additional generalization after the detailed items, and therefore <b>he was saying</b> that the phrase is to be treated as <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization.</b> Consequently, it should have been sufficient for the verse to state merely “theft,” followed by “ox,” followed by “alive.” Why does the Torah specify further items?
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But the latter generalization is not similar to the first generalization.</b> The first generalization, “theft,” is so general that it includes all items, whereas the latter generalization, “alive,” includes only animals. Consequently, the rule of a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization should not apply. The Gemara responds: <b>This <i>tanna</i>,</b> the author of this <i>baraita</i>, <b>is of the school of Rabbi Yishmael, who expounds generalizations and details in a case like this.</b> Even if the first generalization and the latter generalization are dissimilar, he interprets the verse as a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization.
Rava continues his explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And this is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> found <b>difficult</b> at the end of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why do I</b> need the beginning of the verse to state: <b>“If</b> the theft <b>shall be found [<i>himmatze timmatze</i>],”</b> with the verb repeated? Rava now explains the entire <i>baraita</i>, from the beginning: <b>Let</b> the verse <b>say “ox” and “theft” and “alive,” and all</b> items would be <b>included,</b> in accordance with the rules of a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization. Why did the verse include other details?
The <i>baraita</i> answers this by saying: <b>Had</b> the verse been written in <b>this</b> manner, <b>I would have said: Just as</b> the item mentioned in <b>the detail,</b> “ox,” is clearly <b>defined as an item that is sacrificed on the altar, so too everything that is sacrificed on the altar</b> is subject to double payment, but not other items. <b>What</b> else <b>is there</b> for you <b>to include</b> in this category? <b>A sheep. When</b> the verse <b>states “sheep,” a sheep is thereby stated</b> explicitly. Therefore, the detail of “ox” cannot be written to include specifically items that can be sacrificed on the altar, e.g., a sheep. <b>How</b> then <b>do I realize</b> the meaning of the word <b>“theft,”</b> i.e., what is the category of items derived from the detail and generalization? It must be that it serves <b>to include all</b> types of <b>items</b> in the requirement of double payment.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Let</b> the verse <b>say</b> only <b>“theft,” and “ox” and “sheep” and “alive,” and all</b> items <b>would be included.</b> Why is it necessary to write “donkey”? The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>Had</b> the verse been written in <b>this</b> manner, without “donkey,” <b>I would have said: Just as</b> the items mentioned in <b>the detail,</b> “ox” and “sheep,” are clearly <b>defined as items that are</b> subject to being <b>sacred with</b> the sanctity of the <b>firstborn, so too any item that is</b> subject to being <b>sacred with</b> the sanctity of the <b>firstborn</b> is subject to double payment, but not other items.
<b>What is there for you to include</b> in this category? <b>A donkey. When</b> the verse <b>says “donkey,” a donkey is thereby stated</b> explicitly. Therefore, the details of “ox” and “sheep” cannot be written to include specifically items that are subject to being sacred with the sanctity of the firstborn, e.g., a donkey. <b>How</b> then <b>do I realize</b> the meaning of the word <b>“theft,”</b> i.e., what is the category of items derived from the detail and generalization? It must be that it serves <b>to include all</b> types of <b>items</b> in the requirement of double payment.
The <i>baraita</i> then asks: <b>Let</b> the verse <b>say</b> only <b>“theft,” and “ox,” and “sheep,” and “donkey” and “alive,” and</b> in that manner <b>all</b> items would be <b>included.</b> The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>Had</b> the verse been written in <b>this</b> manner, <b>I would say: Just as</b> the items mentioned in <b>the detail,</b> “ox,” “sheep,” and “donkey,” are clearly <b>defined as</b> items that are <b>animals, so too all animals</b> are subject to double payment, but not inanimate objects.
<b>What is there for you to include</b> in this category that is not already listed? <b>Animals other</b> than oxen, sheep, and donkeys. <b>When</b> the verse <b>states “alive,” animals are thereby stated</b> explicitly. Therefore, the details of “ox,” “sheep,” and “donkey” cannot be written to include animals. <b>How</b> then <b>do I realize</b> the meaning of <b>“theft,”</b> i.e., what is the category of items derived from the detail and generalization? It must be that it serves <b>to include all</b> types of <b>items</b> in the requirement of double payment. If so, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase <b>“if</b> the theft <b>shall be found [<i>himmatze timmatze</i>]”?</b> This is the conclusion of the <i>baraita</i> as explained by Rava.

Daf 64b

The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if this is how the <i>baraita</i> is to be understood, <b>the difficulty</b> it posed <b>is valid,</b> as the <i>baraita</i> ends with an unanswered question: Why do I need the phrase: “If the theft shall be found”?
The Gemara answers: This phrase is necessary <b>because there is a refutation for</b> the derivation cited in the <i>baraita</i>, as follows: <b>From where</b> in the verse <b>does</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>derive</b> that it means <b>to include all</b> types of <b>items? From the latter generalization</b> of “alive.” But in <b>the</b> latter <b>generalization itself</b> the word <b>“alive” is written.</b>
<b>What does</b> the principle of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization accomplish,</b> i.e., what does it include in the <i>halakha</i> of double payment? <b>If it is</b> written <b>to include all</b> types of <b>items,</b> this cannot be, as the word <b>“alive” is written</b> in the verse, indicating that if one steals <b>animals, yes,</b> he is liable to pay double payment, but if he steals <b>something else,</b> i.e., inanimate objects, <b>no,</b> he is not liable to pay double payment. <b>Due to this</b> reason, <b>it was necessary</b> for the Torah to include the phrase: <b>“If</b> the theft <b>shall be found [<i>himmatze timmatze</i>],”</b> which includes all items, through the principle of a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization.
The Sages <b>state</b> an objection: <b>But these</b> repeated verbs <b>are two generalizations that are adjacent to each other</b> in the verse, and the details follow both of the generalizations. Consequently, it is not a case of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, but rather of a generalization, a generalization, and a detail. <b>Ravina said:</b> It is <b>as they say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>Any place</b> in the Torah <b>where you find two generalizations adjacent to each other, place the detail between them and</b> then <b>treat them as a generalization, and a detail,</b> and a generalization.
The Gemara applies this principle to the verse: <b>Place</b> the first detail, <b>“ox,” between “<i>himmatze</i>” and “<i>timmatze</i>,”</b> and treat the verse as a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, so that other items that resemble the detail are included. <b>To include what? If</b> it serves <b>to include animals,</b> this is not necessary, as animals <b>are derived from</b> the word <b>“alive”</b> later in the verse. <b>Rather,</b> it serves <b>to include an item that is not an animal,</b> i.e., inanimate objects, <b>and this is how you should expound</b> the verse: <b>Just as</b> the items mentioned in <b>the detail</b> are clearly <b>defined as movable property and</b> are items that have <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value, <b>so too anything that is movable property and has intrinsic monetary</b> value is included, to the exclusion of land and financial documents.
<b>And furthermore,</b> following this method, <b>place</b> the next detail, <b>“donkey,” between <i>himmatze</i> and <i>timmatze</i>,</b> and treat it as a case of a generalization, a detail, and a generalization, so that other items that resemble the detail are included. <b>To include what? If</b> it serves <b>to include an item that is not an animal,</b> this is not necessary, as it already was <b>derived from</b> the word <b>“ox.” Rather,</b> it serves <b>to include an object that is</b> clearly <b>delineated,</b> to the exclusion of objects that are not clearly delineated in size or quantity.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> if this is the correct way to analyze the verse, <b>why do I</b> need the verse to state <b>“sheep”?</b> There is nothing left to include. <b>Rather,</b> this whole approach must be rejected, and a new method of analysis applied, as follows: It is not treated as a case of a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization; rather, <b>it is</b> treated as a verse that <b>amplified, restricted, and amplified, as the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught.</b>
<b>As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught,</b> concerning the verse: “These may you eat of all that are in the waters: Whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers” (Leviticus 11:9), as follows: The verse states: <b>“In the waters,” “in the waters,” two times</b> and only afterward lists the details of seas and rivers. <b>This is not</b> expounded as <b>a generalization, and a detail,</b> and a generalization, because the detail does not appear between the generalizations. <b>Rather,</b> the verse <b>amplified, and</b> then <b>restricted, and</b> then <b>amplified,</b> and thereby <b>amplified</b> the general category “waters” to include <b>everything</b> except for “seas” and “rivers,” the specific matter excluded in the restriction, Here too, since the two generalizations are written before the details, it is expounded as an amplification, a restriction and an amplification.
<b>What do</b> the generalizations <i>himmatze</i> and <i>timmatze</i> <b>include?</b> Do they <b>include all items? If so, why do I</b> need <b>all these details</b> of ox, sheep, and donkey? <b>One</b> detail serves <b>to exclude land, and one</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> Canaanite <b>slaves, and one</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> financial <b>documents.</b> The words <b>“theft” and “alive [<i>ḥayyim</i>]”</b> do not serve to exclude further items from double payment, but <b>to</b> indicate the <i>halakha</i> taught by <b>Rav, who says:</b> If one stole an item, and it deteriorated or its value decreased, he must <b>revive [<i>aḥayah</i>] the principal</b> to the value it had <b>as</b> of the time <b>when he stole</b> it, i.e., he must repay the owner according to the value of the item at the time it was stolen.
§ Until this point, the Gemara has been discussing the source of the obligation of a thief to pay double payment according to the <i>baraita</i> (63b) that maintains that both verses (Exodus 22:6–7) are referring to a bailee who falsely claims that a deposit was stolen from him. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>one</b> of the two verses <b>is</b> speaking <b>about a thief and one</b> verse <b>is</b> speaking <b>about</b> a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole from him, <b>and he derives</b> that <b>a thief himself</b> must pay double payment <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“if the thief shall be found”</b> (Exodus 22:6), <b>what does he derive from this</b> verse: <b>“If</b> the theft <b>shall be found”</b> (Exodus 22:3)?
The Gemara answers: <b>He requires</b> this verse <b>for</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rava bar Ahilai, as Rava bar Ahilai says: What is the reason</b> for the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rav, who says:</b> One who <b>admits</b> he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is exempt,</b> even if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability? <b>As it is written: “If</b> the theft <b>shall be found [<i>himmatze timmatze</i>],”</b> which indicates that <b>if it is found [<i>himmatze</i>] through witnesses</b> that he is liable to pay the fine of double payment, <b>it will be found [<i>timmatze</i>]</b> that the fine will be enforced <b>by judges.</b> This <b>excludes</b> from double payment the case of <b>one who incriminates himself</b> by admitting his liability before any witnesses testify concerning him, and the same is applied to all cases that involve fines.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>both</b> verses are speaking <b>about</b> a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, <b>who applies this</b> verse: <b>“If</b> the theft <b>shall be found,” to the thief himself, from where do we</b> derive that <b>one who incriminates himself</b> is exempt from paying double payment or any other fine? The Gemara answers: He derives it <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“The one whom the judges convict</b> shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8), which indicates that only one who is convicted by the judges on the basis of testimony must pay double, <b>but not one who incriminates himself.</b>
The Gemara continues its line of questioning: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>one</b> verse is speaking <b>about a thief</b> himself <b>and one</b> verse is speaking <b>about</b> a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, <b>who derives from: “If</b> the theft <b>shall be found” that one who incriminates himself</b> is exempt from payment of the fine, <b>what does he expound from this</b> verse: <b>“The one whom the judges convict</b> shall pay double to his neighbor”? He could have <b>said to you: That</b> verse <b>is necessary to</b> teach <b>that</b> one who <b>admits</b> his liability to pay <b>a fine</b> is <b>exempt</b> from payment if witnesses never come to testify against him. “If the theft shall be found” indicates that even if witnesses do come after he admitted his liability, he is exempt from paying the fine.
The Gemara continues: <b>And the one who says</b> that <b>both</b> verses <b>are</b> speaking <b>about</b> a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, and, as explained previously, derives from “if the theft shall be found” that a thief is required to pay double payment, <b>holds</b> that in the case of one who <b>admits</b> that he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine, and afterward witnesses came</b> and testified to his liability, he is <b>obligated</b> to pay the fine, contrary to the opinion of Rav.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>one</b> verse is speaking <b>about a thief</b> himself <b>and one</b> verse is speaking <b>about</b> a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, <b>who derives</b> the <i>halakha</i> of double payment for <b>a thief from there,</b> i.e., from the verse “if the thief shall be found” (Exodus 22:6), there is a difficulty. <b>Granted,</b> the phrase <b>“if</b> the theft <b>shall be found”</b> is required <b>for</b> teaching the <i>halakha</i> of <b>Rava bar Ahilai. But why do I</b> need <b>all these details,</b> “ox,” “donkey,” “sheep,” and “alive”? All the items excluded from double payment, such as land and slaves, are already derived from a different source.
The Gemara answers: This may be explained <b>in accordance with</b> what <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught. As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Any passage that was stated</b> in the Torah <b>and was</b> then <b>repeated, was repeated only for</b> the sake of <b>a matter that was introduced</b> for the first time in the repeated passage. That is, sometimes the Torah repeats an entire passage just for the sake of a single new detail. The single new detail derived from this passage is the <i>halakha</i> that one who admits that he is liable to pay a fine is exempt from paying the fine, which is derived from the words: “If the theft shall be found.”
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> since the two cases of a thief and a bailee who falsely claims the deposit was stolen are juxtaposed, as their obligations to pay double payment are expressed in consecutive verses, <b>say</b> that <b>a thief himself</b> is not obligated to pay double payment unless he falsely confirms his innocence <b>with an oath,</b> just as a bailee is liable to pay double payment only under these circumstances.
The Gemara answers: This <b>cannot enter your mind, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that the phrase “if the theft shall be found…<b>he shall pay double”</b> indicates that a thief pays double even <b>without</b> taking <b>an oath.</b> Rabbi Ya’akov elaborates: Do <b>you say</b> the verse obligates every thief, even <b>without</b> his taking <b>an oath? Or</b> perhaps <b>it is</b> speaking <b>only</b> of a thief who falsely confirms his innocence <b>with an oath? You</b> must <b>say: This</b> second possibility <b>was not</b> the Torah’s intent.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>This was not</b> the Torah’s intent? What is the proof that the Torah could not have meant that only a thief who falsely confirms his innocence with an oath pays double payment? <b>Abaye said:</b> If this was the Torah’s intent, <b>let the Merciful One not write “he shall pay double” with regard to a thief</b> at all, <b>and let it be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the case of a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, as follows: If, in the case of a bailee who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, <b>for whom the</b> deposit initially <b>came into his possession in a permitted</b> fashion, <b>the verse states that he must pay double,</b> then in the case of <b>a thief himself, for whom</b> the stolen object <b>came into his possession in a prohibited manner</b> from the start, is it <b>not</b> clear <b>all the more so</b> that he must pay double payment?
<b>But</b> then <b>why do I</b> need the words <b>“he shall pay double,” which the Merciful One wrote concerning a thief himself?</b> It must be that the verse adds to the requirement of double payment for a thief and indicates <b>that</b> he must pay double <b>even without</b> having taken <b>an oath.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And does this</b> verse, which states <b>“if</b> the theft <b>shall be found”</b> and concludes “he shall pay double,” <b>come for this</b> purpose? <b>Isn’t it required for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “If the theft shall be found in his possession.” From the term “in <b>his possession [<i>yado</i>],”</b>

Daf 65a

<b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a case where the stolen item is found in <b>his hand [<i>yado</i>]. From where</b> do I derive that the same <i>halakha</i> applies if it is found on <b>his roof,</b> in <b>his yard, or</b> in <b>his enclosure [<i>vekarpeifo</i>]? The verse states</b> the repetitive phrase <b>“if</b> the theft <b>shall be found [<i>himmatze timmatze</i>],”</b> to indicate that the same <i>halakha</i> applies <b>in any case,</b> i.e., in any location that the stolen item is found.
The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> if this is all the phrase is coming to teach, <b>let the verse state</b> the identical word twice: <b><i>Himmatze himmatze</i>, or: <i>Timmatze timmatze</i>. From</b> the fact that <b>the verse varied</b> its wording, one may <b>conclude two</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from it:</b> That one is liable to pay double payment regardless of where the stolen item was found, and that a thief pays double payment even if he did not take an oath.
§ The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav says:</b> When a thief makes his payments, the <b>principal</b> is paid <b>according to</b> the value as of the time <b>when he stole</b> it, whereas the <b>double payment and</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment</b> are calculated <b>according to</b> the value at <b>the time of standing trial.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason,</b> i.e., the source, for this ruling <b>of Rav?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “If the <b>theft</b> shall be found in his possession <b>alive,</b> whether it is an ox, or a donkey, or a sheep, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:3). <b>Why is the Merciful One saying “alive [<i>ḥayyim</i>]” in</b> the context of this <b>theft?</b> This juxtaposition serves to teach: When making payment, <b>revive [<i>aḥayah</i>] the principal</b> to the value it had <b>as</b> of the time <b>when he stole</b> it.
<b>Rav Sheshet said: I say</b> that <b>when Rav was sleepy and lying down</b> to rest, <b>he said this <i>halakha</i>.</b> Rav Sheshet meant that this is a careless ruling, as it is contrary to a <i>baraita</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the animal was stolen when it was <b>lean and</b> the thief <b>fattened it, he pays</b> the <b>double payment and</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment according to</b> the value of the animal as of the time <b>when he stole</b> it. This shows that the double payment and the fourfold and fivefold payment are applied in accordance with the value of the item at the time of the theft, not its value at the time of trial, as claimed by Rav.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: This <i>baraita</i> is not a refutation of Rav’s opinion, <b>because</b> the thief <b>could say to</b> the owner of the animal: <b>I fattened</b> the animal myself, <b>and will you take</b> for yourself the added value from its fattening? In this particular case, Rav would agree that all payments are in accordance with the value of the item at the time of the theft.
The Gemara asks further: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another <i>baraita</i> that apparently contradicts Rav’s ruling. If the animal was stolen when it was <b>fat and the thief caused it to become lean, he pays</b> the <b>double payment and</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment according to</b> the value of the animal as of the time <b>when he stole</b> it. The double and fourfold and fivefold payments are not paid in accordance with the value at the time of the trial, as claimed by Rav.
The Gemara answers: <b>There too,</b> there is a reason for this exception, <b>because we say of</b> the thief: <b>What is it to me</b> if he <b>killed</b> the animal <b>entirely,</b> and <b>what is it to me</b> if <b>he killed it partially?</b> By causing the animal to become lean, the thief is considered to have started to put it to death. Consequently, when he ultimately kills the animal, he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment according to its value when he first began to weaken it, i.e., at the time of the theft. <b>When Rav says</b> his ruling, <b>he is saying</b> it only <b>with regard to</b> cases of <b>appreciation</b> in value <b>and depreciation</b> in value, not to changes in the animal’s physical state.
<b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case referred to by Rav? <b>If we say that initially</b> the stolen item <b>was worth one dinar and in the end it was worth four dinars,</b> and Rav teaches that the thief pays the <b>principal according to</b> the value of the animal as of the time <b>when he stole</b> it, which is one dinar, <b>shall we say that Rav disagrees with this</b> ruling <b>of Rabba? As Rabba says:</b> With regard to <b>this one who robbed another of a barrel of wine,</b> if it was <b>initially worth one dinar and ultimately it was worth four dinars,</b> and after its appreciation the robber <b>broke</b> the barrel <b>or drank</b> the wine, <b>he pays four</b> dinars. If the barrel <b>broke by itself, he pays one dinar.</b> Rabba holds that even the principal is paid according to the time when he broke the barrel.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response that Rav agrees with Rabba with regard to the above case. <b>When Rav says</b> his <i>halakha</i> he is referring to a case where, <b>for example,</b> the item was <b>initially worth four</b> dinars <b>and ultimately was worth one dinar.</b> In this situation, Rav maintains that the thief does not profit from the decrease in the value of the principal. Rather, he pays the <b>principal according to</b> its value as of the time <b>when he stole</b> it, <b>and</b> the <b>double payment and</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment</b> are paid <b>according to</b> the value at <b>the time of standing trial.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina teaches</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>in support of Rav:</b> In the case of <b>a homeowner</b> acting as a bailee, <b>who</b> falsely <b>stated the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the <b>deposit, and</b> subsequently <b>took an oath</b> as to the truth of his claim, <b>and</b> then <b>admitted</b> that he was lying and that he in fact took the item himself, <b>and</b> at some point <b>witnesses came</b> and testified that the bailee himself had the item, <b>if he admitted</b> his guilt <b>before the witnesses came</b> and testified, <b>he pays</b> the <b>principal and</b> an additional <b>one-fifth, and</b> he must also bring <b>a guilt-offering. But if he admitted</b> his guilt <b>after witnesses came</b> and testified, <b>he pays</b> the <b>double payment and</b> brings <b>a guilt-offering, and his</b> additional <b>one-fifth is covered by his double payment</b> that he pays; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Ya’akov.</b>

Daf 65b

<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> It is written concerning a bailee who falsely claims innocence with regard to a deposit entrusted to him: “He shall restore it <b>according to its principal, and</b> shall add <b>its fifth part</b> to it” (Leviticus 5:24). This verse teaches that with regard to <b>monetary restitution that is paid</b> precisely <b>according to the principal, one adds one-fifth,</b> but for <b>monetary restitution that is not paid</b> precisely <b>according to the principal,</b> as is the case here, where the bailee pays double the principal value, <b>one does not add one-fifth. Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says:</b> Neither the additional <b>one-fifth nor</b> the <b>guilt-offering is paid in a case where there is double payment.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
Rabbi Ḥanina explains: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: His</b> payment of the additional <b>one-fifth is covered by his double payment;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Ya’akov. What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say that</b> the stolen item was <b>initially worth four</b> dinars <b>and ultimately,</b> at the time of trial, was still <b>worth four</b> dinars, how could he say: <b>His</b> payment of the additional <b>one-fifth is covered by his double payment?</b>
This statement is inaccurate in this case, as <b>the double payment,</b> i.e., the penalty included in the double payment, is <b>four</b> dinars, <b>and the</b> additional <b>one-fifth is one dinar.</b> When the Torah states “fifth” it means one-fifth of the total payment of the one-fifth and the principal together, i.e., one-quarter of the principal. For the additional one-fifth to be covered by the double payment, the two must be exactly equal, which is not the case here. <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a situation where <b>initially</b> it was <b>worth four</b> dinars <b>and at the end</b> it was <b>worth one dinar, as the</b> penalty component of the <b>double payment</b> is <b>one dinar and the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> is also <b>one dinar?</b>
<b>Apparently,</b> the <b>principal,</b> as well as the additional one-fifth, is paid <b>according to</b> the value as of the time <b>when he stole,</b> whereas the <b>double payment and</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment</b> is <b>according to</b> the value at <b>the time of standing trial,</b> as claimed by Rav.
The Gemara refutes this analysis. <b>Rava said: Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> could be referring to a case in which <b>initially</b> it was <b>worth four</b> dinars <b>and now,</b> at the time of trial, it is <b>also worth four</b> dinars. <b>And</b> as for <b>what is difficult</b> with this case, namely that <b>the double payment</b> is <b>four</b> dinars <b>and the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> is <b>one dinar,</b> this problem can be resolved as follows: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> It is a case <b>where</b> the bailee <b>took an oath</b> that the deposit was stolen from him, <b>and he again took</b> the same <b>oath,</b> and so on <b>four times, and</b> after each oath <b>he admitted</b> afterward that he had lied. <b>And the Torah said: “And</b> shall add <b>its fifth part [<i>ḥamishitav</i>]</b> to it” (Leviticus 5:24).
Rava continues: The term <i>ḥamishitav</i> is in the plural, which indicates that <b>the Torah included</b> the possibility of <b>many</b> payments of an additional <b>one-fifth for a single principal.</b> In other words, each time the bailee takes a false oath he becomes obligated to pay an additional one-fifth, despite the fact that each oath concerns the same item. Since he did so four times, and the one-fifth is actually one-quarter of the principal, the total amount of payments of the additional one-fifth is equal to the principal, which is the same as the penalty component of the double payment.
§ <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And the Sages say:</b> “He shall restore it <b>according to its principal, and</b> shall add <b>its fifth part</b> to it” (Leviticus 5:24). This verse teaches that for <b>monetary restitution that is paid</b> precisely <b>according to the principal, one adds one-fifth.</b> But for <b>monetary restitution that is not paid</b> precisely <b>according to the principal, one does not add one-fifth.</b> The Gemara infers: He does not add one-fifth, <b>but he</b> is obligated to <b>bring a guilt-offering.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about the additional <b>one-fifth</b> in that case, <b>that he does not</b> have to <b>pay</b> it? <b>As it is written:</b> “He shall restore it <b>according to its principal, and</b> shall add <b>its fifth part</b> to it.” This indicates that the additional one-fifth is linked to the payment of the precise amount of the principal amount. If so, with regard to the <b>guilt offering as well,</b> he should <b>not</b> have to <b>pay,</b> i.e., bring it, <b>as it is written:</b> “He shall restore it <b>according to its principal, and</b> shall add <b>its fifth part</b> to it…<b>and his guilt-offering [<i>ve’et ashamo</i>]</b> he shall bring to the Lord” (Leviticus 5:24–25). The verse links the guilt-offering to the payment of the precise amount of the principal, just like it does the additional one-fifth.
The Gemara answers: <b>The Sages</b> would <b>say to you</b> in response: The superfluous word <b>“<i>et</i>”</b> in the phrase “and his guilt offering [<i>ve’et ashamo</i>]” <b>divides the verse.</b> Therefore, only the additional one-fifth payment, but not the guilt-offering, is linked to the payment of the precise amount of the principal.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai,</b> who maintains that this bailee is exempt from a guilt-offering as well, how would he respond to the Sages’ argument concerning “<i>et</i>”? He would point out that the term in question is actually <b>“<i>ve’et</i>,”</b> consisting of the word <i>et</i> preceded by the letter <i>vav</i>, meaning “and.” The conjunction <b>joins</b> the clauses of <b>the verse.</b> Therefore, both the additional one-fifth payment and the guilt-offering are linked to the payment of the precise amount of the principal. <b>And the Rabbis</b> would respond to Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai’s claim and <b>say to you:</b> If the Torah had intended that the two issues should be joined together, <b>let the Merciful One write neither</b> the <b><i>vav</i> nor “<i>et</i>.”</b>
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in response to this argument: It is <b>not possible</b> for the verse <b>to have not written “<i>et</i>,”</b> as this term is necessary <b>to separate between property</b> belonging to the <b>Most High,</b> i.e., the guilt-offering, <b>and non-sacred property,</b> i.e., that of a Jew. <b>Therefore,</b> as the verse had to use “<i>et</i>” to indicate this difference, the <b><i>vav</i> comes</b> and <b>joins</b> the clauses of the <b>verse.</b>
§ The Gemara discusses other cases in which an object undergoes a change after it has been stolen. <b>Rabbi Ile’a says:</b> If one <b>stole a lamb and it</b> subsequently <b>became a ram,</b> or if he stole <b>a calf and it</b> subsequently <b>became a bull,</b> the stolen item <b>has undergone a change</b> while <b>in</b> the thief’s <b>possession, and he has</b> therefore <b>acquired it</b> as his own property. Consequently, his obligation of restitution consists of monetary payment rather than giving back the stolen item itself. If he subsequently <b>slaughtered or sold</b> the animal, it is in effect <b>his own</b> animal that <b>he slaughters,</b> or it is <b>his own</b> animal that <b>he sells,</b> and he is not obligated in the fourfold or fivefold payment.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina raised an objection to Rabbi Ile’a</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>stole a lamb and it</b> subsequently <b>became a ram,</b> of if he stole <b>a calf and it</b> subsequently <b>became a bull, he pays</b> the <b>double payment and</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment according to</b> the animal’s value as of the time <b>when he stole</b> it. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that in a case of this kind the thief <b>has acquired</b> the animal as his own property <b>by</b> virtue of the physical <b>change</b> the animal underwent when it matured, <b>why does he pay</b> the fourfold or fivefold payment? After all, it is <b>his own</b> animal that <b>he slaughters,</b> or it is <b>his own</b> animal that <b>he sells.</b>
Rabbi Ile’a <b>said to him: Rather, what</b> would you conclude from the <i>baraita</i>? <b>That</b> this physical <b>change</b> in the stolen animal <b>does not</b> serve to <b>acquire</b> it for the thief and render it his property? If so, <b>why</b> should he <b>pay according to</b> the animal’s value as of the time <b>when he stole</b> it? <b>Let him pay according to</b> the animal’s value <b>now,</b> i.e., at the time of the slaughter or sale.
Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to him: This is the reason that he does not pay in accordance with</b> the animal’s value <b>now:</b> It is <b>because</b> the thief can <b>say to</b> the animal’s owner: <b>Did I steal a bull from you,</b> or: <b>Did I steal a ram from you?</b> No; I stole only a calf or a lamb, and therefore I will pay you the value of the animal when I stole it. Rabbi Ile’a <b>said to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina: <b>May the Merciful One save us from this opinion</b> of yours! Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said</b> back <b>to him: On the contrary, may the Merciful One save us from your opinion!</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to this: But</b> even if an animal’s natural growth is not considered a physical change, <b>let the thief acquire it through</b> its <b>change in name,</b> i.e., its change of classification, as the animal was originally called a calf or a lamb and now it is considered a bull or ram.
<b>Rava says:</b> There is in fact no change in name here, as even <b>a day-old bull is called a bull,</b> and even <b>a day-old ram is called a ram. A day-old bull is called a bull, as it is written: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat is born”</b> (Leviticus 22:27).
<b>A day-old ram is called a ram,</b> as can be derived from Jacob’s statement to Laban, <b>as it is written: “And the rams of your flock I have not eaten”</b> (Genesis 31:38). Now, did Jacob mean that <b>he did not eat</b> any of Laban’s <b>rams,</b> but younger <b>lambs he did eat?</b> This is certainly not the meaning of this verse, as this would mean he was a thief. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> this verse that <b>a day-old ram is called a ram?</b>
<b>In any case,</b> the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier by Rabbi Ḥanina <b>is difficult</b> for the opinion of Rabbi Ile’a, as it states that the thief must pay the fourfold or fivefold payment despite the fact that the slaughter or sale of the animal took place after it matured from a calf to a bull or from a lamb to a ram. To resolve the difficulty, <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, who say:</b> An item, even if it has undergone a physical <b>change, remains in its place,</b> i.e., a stolen item remains in the possession of its owner, <b>and</b> a thief <b>does not acquire</b> it even if it undergoes a change.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If one gave wheat</b> to a prostitute <b>for her payment,</b> i.e., the hire of her services, <b>and</b> she <b>made</b> the wheat into <b>flour;</b> or if he gave her <b>olives and</b> she <b>made them</b> into <b>oil;</b> or if he gave her <b>grapes and</b> she <b>made them</b> into <b>wine, it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>prohibited</b> to bring these products as an offering in the Temple, in accordance with the verse: “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot…into the house of the Lord your God for any vow” (Deuteronomy 23:19). <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that these products are <b>permitted,</b> as the physical change renders them into new items. <b>And Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>Guryon of Asporak teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Beit Shammai prohibit</b> these products <b>and Beit Hillel permit</b> them. If so, these two <i>baraitot</i> reflect a dispute between Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel.
The Gemara clarifies the source of these two opinions. <b>What is the reason of Beit Shammai</b> for prohibiting these products? <b>As it is written:</b> “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot, or the price of a dog, into the house of the Lord your God for any vow; for even both of these are an abomination to the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19). The apparently superfluous word <b>“even”</b> serves <b>to include their changed</b> status. <b>And Beit Hillel,</b> who permit these items after they have undergone a physical change, maintain that the term <b>“these”</b> in the phrase “both of these” teaches that this prohibition applies only to the original items, <b>but not</b> to <b>their changed</b> form.
<b>And Beit Shammai</b> would reply: <b>That</b> term,

Daf 66a

<b>“these,” comes to</b> teach that this <i>halakha</i> applies only to the animals given as payment to the prostitute <b>but not</b> to <b>their offspring.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> from where do <b>Beit Hillel</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? They would say that one should <b>conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from</b> this term: <b>“These”</b> items are disqualified, <b>but not</b> when they are in <b>their changed</b> form, <b>and “these”</b> are disqualified, <b>but not their offspring.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel, isn’t it written “even”?</b> Since Beit Hillel reject the <i>halakha</i> that Beit Shammai derive from this term, what do they learn from it? The Gemara states: Indeed, the word <b>“even” is difficult according to</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel.</b>
In any event, they <b>disagree only with regard to</b> this particular issue: One <b>Sage,</b> Beit Hillel, <b>holds</b> that a physical <b>change</b> in a stolen item causes the thief to <b>acquire</b> it, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Beit Shammai, <b>holds</b> that a physical <b>change</b> in a stolen item <b>does not</b> cause the thief to <b>acquire</b> it. <b>But with regard to</b> the <b>payment</b> of the thief, <b>everyone</b> agrees that <b>he pays according to</b> the <b>initial</b> value of the item, at the time of the theft, <b>as it teaches</b> in the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>He pays</b> the <b>double payment and</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment according to</b> the animal’s value as of the time <b>when he stole</b> it.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> constitutes <b>a conclusive refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rav? As Rav says:</b> When a thief makes his payments, <b>he pays</b> the <b>principal according to</b> the value as of the time <b>when he stole</b> it, whereas the <b>double payment and</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment</b> are calculated <b>according to</b> the value at <b>the time of standing trial. Rava said</b> in resolution of this difficulty: If one stole <b>lambs</b> that subsequently became rams or were fattened, he pays the double payment and the fourfold or fivefold payment according to the <b>initial</b> state of the animal, as claimed by both Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel. If there was a change in the animal’s value due to fluctuation of the monetary <b>value</b> of animals, he pays <b>according to</b> the animal’s worth <b>now,</b> at the time of standing trial.
§ <b>Rabba said:</b> The principle that <b>a change</b> in a stolen item causes the thief to <b>acquire</b> it <b>is written</b> in the Torah, <b>and we learned</b> it in a mishna as well. <b>It is written</b> in the Torah: “Then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, <b>that he shall restore the item that he robbed”</b> (Leviticus 5:23). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the seemingly superfluous phrase <b>“that he robbed”?</b> This serves to teach that <b>if</b> the item is the same <b>as</b> it was <b>when he stole</b> it, <b>he must return</b> the stolen item itself. <b>But if</b> it is <b>not</b> the same as it was then, <b>he is required</b> to <b>pay only money,</b> while the stolen item remains his to keep.
<b>We learned</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a mishna as well, as it is taught (93b): In the case of <b>one who robs</b> another of <b>wood and fashions it</b> into <b>vessels,</b> or one who robs another of <b>wool and fashions it</b> into <b>garments, he pays</b> the robbery victim <b>according to</b> the value of the goods at the <b>time of the robbery,</b> and keeps the altered materials for himself.
<b>Alternatively,</b> another mishna can serve as the source for this principle (<i>Ḥullin</i> 135a): <b>If one did not manage to give</b> the first of the sheared wool of his sheep to a priest <b>until</b> after <b>he dyed it</b> (see Deuteronomy 18:4), he is <b>exempt</b> from giving it to the priest. This mishna indicates that an item that has undergone a change is no longer considered the same item as it had been. <b>Apparently,</b> a physical <b>change</b> in a stolen item causes the thief to <b>acquire</b> it.
§ Rabba continues to discuss the ways in which a thief acquires ownership of a stolen item: With regard to the owner’s <b>despair</b> over ever recovering the stolen item, <b>the Sages say that</b> this too causes the thief to <b>acquire</b> the stolen item. <b>However, we do not know if</b> this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>by Torah law or by rabbinic law.</b>
Rabba elaborates on the two possibilities he has just mentioned: <b>If</b> it applies <b>by Torah law,</b> this is <b>just as it is with regard to one who finds a lost item.</b> Is it <b>not</b> the case with regard to <b>one who finds a lost item</b> that <b>once</b> the <b>owner</b> of the item <b>despairs</b> of recovering it, <b>before</b> the item <b>came into</b> the finder’s <b>possession,</b> the finder <b>acquires it</b> and may keep it for himself? The same principle applies to <b>this</b> thief <b>as well: Once the owner</b> of the item <b>despairs</b> of recovering it, the thief <b>acquires it</b> for himself and need no longer return it. <b>Apparently,</b> then, the despair of the owner causes the thief to <b>acquire</b> the stolen item.
<b>Or perhaps</b> the case of a stolen item is <b>not comparable to</b> the case <b>of a lost item,</b> as <b>it is</b> only with regard to <b>a lost item</b> that the owner’s despair enables the finder to acquire the item, because the item <b>came into his possession in a permitted</b> manner. <b>But</b> in <b>this</b> case of the thief, <b>since</b> the item <b>came into his possession in a prohibited</b> manner, this case cannot be derived from the <i>halakha</i> of a lost item. If so, the ruling that despair effects acquisition in a case of theft applies not by Torah law but <b>by rabbinic law.</b>
Why would this <i>halakha</i> have been instituted by rabbinic law? <b>As, the Sages said that</b> a thief <b>should acquire</b> the stolen item in this manner, <b>due to an ordinance</b> instituted <b>for the penitent.</b> To encourage thieves to repent and repay their victims, the Sages instituted that they need not return the stolen item after the owner despairs of recovering it. Rather, they can reimburse the owner for the monetary value of the item.
<b>And Rav Yosef says: Despair</b> on the part of the owner over the possibility of recovering his item <b>does not</b> cause the thief to <b>acquire</b> that item at all, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even by rabbinic law.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef raised an objection to Rabba</b> from a mishna (96b): If <b>one robbed</b> another of <b>leavened bread and Passover elapsed</b> in the meantime, so that deriving benefit from it is prohibited,

Daf 66b

the robber may nonetheless return the worthless bread to the owner and <b>say to him: That which is yours is before you,</b> and no compensation is required. Rav Yosef states his objection: <b>But</b> in <b>this</b> case, <b>once the time of</b> the <b>prohibition</b> of leavened bread <b>arrives,</b> the owner <b>certainly despairs</b> of recovering his now-worthless bread. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that the owner’s <b>despair</b> causes the robber to <b>acquire</b> the stolen item, <b>why</b> can <b>he say to him: That which is yours is before you? He should be required to pay</b> the owner <b>full-fledged money</b> rather than return the worthless food, as the bread now belongs to the robber.
Rava <b>said to</b> him in response: <b>When I say</b> that the thief acquires the stolen item upon the owner’s despair of recovery it is when <b>this</b> owner <b>despairs, and that</b> thief <b>wants to acquire</b> the item. In <b>this</b> case, <b>this</b> one <b>despairs but that</b> one <b>does not wish to acquire</b> the worthless bread.
<b>Abaye raised an objection to Rabba</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. The verse: “If his offering is a burnt-offering of the herd” (Leviticus 1:3), indicates that one’s offering must be <b>“his offering,” but not</b> an animal <b>stolen</b> from another. <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case referred to by the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say</b> it is dealing with a stolen animal that the robber consecrates and sacrificed <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovery, <b>why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach this? It <b>is obvious</b> that this is disqualified, as one cannot even consecrate an animal that does not belong to him.
<b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to one who seeks to consecrate and sacrifice a stolen animal <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair?</b> And yet the <i>baraita</i> teaches that the animal cannot be consecrated by the thief. <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovering a stolen item <b>does not</b> cause the thief to <b>acquire</b> it, as if it belonged to him he would be able to consecrate and sacrifice it.
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye in refutation of this proof: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> consider <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written with regard to a <i>zav</i>, a man who experiences a gonorrhea-like discharge: “And whoever touches his bedding shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be impure until the evening” (Leviticus 15:5). This indicates that bedding on which a <i>zav</i> lies can become ritually impure and impart impurity only if it is <b>“his bedding,” but not</b> if it is <b>stolen</b> bedding.
<b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case discussed in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If we say that he robbed</b> another of <b>wool and made it into bedding, is there anyone who says that</b> a physical <b>change</b> that results from <b>an action</b> performed to a stolen item <b>does not</b> cause the thief to <b>acquire it? Rather, what have you to say?</b> The <i>baraita</i> must be speaking of a case in <b>which</b> the <i>zav</i> <b>robbed another</b> of <b>bedding. So too,</b> the previous <i>baraita</i> is dealing with one <b>who robbed another</b> of <b>an offering,</b> already consecrated. The reason this animal does not atone for the thief is that a consecrated animal cannot be stolen and become the thief’s property, as it belongs to the Temple treasury wherever it is located.
<b>Abaye raised an objection to Rav Yosef</b> from a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 26:8): With regard to <b>hides belonging to a homeowner,</b> one’s <b>thought renders them susceptible to</b> contracting <b>ritual impurity.</b> Hides and leather are susceptible to contracting impurity only if they are in a finished state. If a private individual uses a piece of hide or leather for a certain purpose, e.g., as a cot or a table top, and decides that this will be its fixed purpose, it is considered a finished product and is susceptible to contracting impurity.
<b>But</b> with regard to hides <b>belonging to a leatherworker, thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> Since this individual sells leather to others, when he uses a piece of leather for a household purpose and decides that this will be its fixed purpose, this is not considered a finished state, as he is likely to change his mind and sell the leather to one who will process it further and put it to a different use.
The mishna continues: If the hides are those <b>of a thief,</b> who has stolen them from another, the thief’s <b>thought renders them susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> If they are those <b>of a robber</b> his <b>thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity,</b> because he is not considered the owner of the hide. The difference is that unlike the case of a thief, who steals items stealthily, the identity of a robber, who takes the item openly, is known to the owner, and the owner harbors hope of finding the robber and getting the item back. Consequently, he does not despair of recovering his property.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that <b>the matters are reversed:</b> In the case <b>of a robber,</b> the robber’s <b>thought renders them susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> If the hides are those <b>of a thief, thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity, because the owners have not despaired</b> of recovering them and the thief has not acquired the hide. Rabbi Shimon’s reasoning is that a robber, who seizes items brazenly, is a more difficult criminal to apprehend and bring to justice than a thief.
<b>And</b> although the two <i>tanna’im</i> of the mishna disagree as to which situation involves an owner’s despair of recovery, whether robbery or theft, in any event one can <b>conclude from</b> this mishna that the <b>despair</b> of the owner causes the thief or robber to <b>acquire</b> the item, as otherwise the perpetrator’s thoughts about the hide would have no effect on its status with regard to ritual impurity. Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Abaye in response: <b>With what are we dealing here</b> in this mishna? It is a case <b>where</b> the thief or robber <b>trimmed</b> the leather by cutting it. Although trimming a piece of leather is not a sufficient change to constitute an act of acquisition by itself, it is effective in conjunction with the owner’s despair.
<b>Rabba bar Rav Ḥanan objects to this</b> answer: <b>But</b> is it <b>not</b> the case that <b>they taught</b> this mishna <b>here</b> with regard to a leather table <b>top [<i>itzba</i>]? And</b> a leather table <b>top does not require trimming,</b> either due to the fact that its edges are not seen or because it is merely ornamental. Since it does not require trimming, this action should not be considered an act of acquisition at all.
<b>As we learned</b> in the previous mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 26:7): <b>Wherever there is no work lacking</b> for an item to be considered finished, one’s <b>thought renders it susceptible to ritual impurity; when there is</b> still some <b>work lacking</b> for the item to be considered finished, <b>thought does not render it susceptible to ritual impurity, except for</b> the case of a leather table <b>top.</b> Although further work is required to smooth out the edges, one’s thought can render it susceptible to impurity because people do not care if this leather table top has uneven edges. It is with regard to this case of a table top that the mishna distinguishes between a homeowner and a leatherworker. Therefore, Rav Yosef’s explanation is rejected.
The Gemara suggests a different answer. <b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>this matter was a difficulty</b> posed by <b>Rabba to Rav Yosef for twenty-two years, and it was not resolved until Rav Yosef sat as the head</b> of the yeshiva <b>and resolved it</b> in the following manner: <b>A change in name</b> of an item, representing a change in status, <b>is similar to</b> a physical <b>change</b> brought about by <b>an action.</b>
<b>What is the reason</b> that a physical <b>change</b> through <b>an action</b> causes the thief to acquire the item? It is because <b>there</b> the stolen items were <b>initially</b> just <b>wood,</b> and <b>now</b> they are <b>vessels.</b> The same can be said for <b>a change in name as well: Initially they called it a hide, and now</b> they call it a table <b>top [<i>abrazin</i>].</b>
The Gemara asks a question with regard to changes in name: <b>But</b> what about the case of <b>a beam, where there is a change in name, as initially,</b> when it was stolen, it was called <b>a beam, and now,</b> after it has been placed in a building, it is called <b>a joist [<i>telala</i>], and</b> yet <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 55a): <b>With regard to a stolen beam that</b> a robber <b>had built into</b> a large <b>building,</b> the court ruled <b>that</b> the owner <b>should</b> receive <b>its</b> value in <b>money</b> rather than demand that the robber demolish the house to return the beam itself, <b>because of an ordinance</b> instituted <b>for the penitent,</b> i.e., to encourage robbers to admit their crime and reimburse the owner of the stolen item.
This mishna indicates that <b>the</b> only <b>reason</b> the robber does not have to return the beam itself is <b>because of</b> this <b>ordinance</b> instituted <b>for the penitent.</b>

Daf 67a

One can infer: <b>But</b> if were <b>not</b> for <b>this</b> decree, the beam would have to be <b>returned</b> to the owner <b>as is,</b> notwithstanding its change in name. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This is not a genuine change in name, as <b>a beam retains its name</b> even after it is inserted into a building. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to two obscure terms: The verse states: “And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch; there were also the <i>tzalot</i> of the house, and the <i>ubbim</i>” (Ezekiel 41:26). <b>“<i>Tzalot</i> of the house”; these are the casings [<i>hamaltetin</i>]. “And the <i>ubbim</i>”; these are the beams [<i>hamerishot</i>].</b> This shows that a beam can retain its name even after it has been built into a house.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said</b> a different answer: With regard to <b>a change in name, a change</b> in which the item <b>can revert to its original state is not</b> considered enough of <b>a change</b> for the thief to acquire the stolen item. Since the joist can be removed and revert to being called a beam, it is not considered a true change of name.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is a change in name</b> in <b>which</b> the item <b>does not revert to its original state</b> really considered <b>a change? But there is</b> the case of a water <b>duct, where</b> it was <b>initially</b> called <b>a log [<i>ketzitzta</i>] and now</b> it is called <b>a duct, and it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A duct that one hollowed out and afterward attached</b> to the ground or to a building <b>invalidates a ritual bath</b> through the water it channels to the bath. The water in a ritual bath must be gathered directly from rain or a stream, not drawn with vessels. If one hollowed out a log and used it to channel water into the bath, this is considered drawn water, as he used a vessel.
By contrast, if <b>one attached it</b> first <b>and afterward hollowed it out, it does not invalidate the ritual bath.</b> Before the log was hollowed out, it was already attached to and considered part of the ground, and therefore the act of hollowing it out does not turn it into a vessel.
The Gemara states its question: <b>And if you say that a change in name is</b> considered <b>a matter</b> of significance, i.e., it is considered a real change in the item, then <b>even if one attached</b> the log first <b>and afterward hollowed it out,</b> the ritual bath <b>should also be invalid.</b> Since hollowing out the log leads to a change in name, it should be considered a new vessel at that point.
The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> that <b>drawn</b> water may not be used for a ritual bath <b>is different, as it</b> applies <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and consequently the Sages were lenient in this case. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even in the first clause,</b> where the log was hollowed out before being attached, it should be permitted <b>as well.</b> The Gemara answers: There is a difference between the two cases. <b>There,</b> in the first clause, the log <b>had the status of a vessel while</b> it was still <b>detached. Here,</b> in the second case, it did <b>not have the status of a vessel while</b> it was <b>detached,</b> but only after it became attached to the ground, and therefore the Sages were lenient.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against Rav Yosef’s opinion that the owner’s despair that he will recover his stolen items does not effect acquisition for the thief, from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a thief, a robber, and one who forces</b> people to sell him items against their will, <b>their consecration</b> of the items they obtained in these manners is a valid <b>consecration; and the <i>teruma</i> that they separate</b> from the produce they obtained in these manners is valid <b><i>teruma</i>; and the tithes that they separate</b> from those foods are valid <b>tithes.</b> Consecrations, <i>terumot</i>, and tithes must be performed by the owner of the item in question. Since there was no physical change in these items, this shows that the thief is considered the new owner merely by virtue of the owner’s despair of recovery.
The Sages <b>say,</b> in answer to this question: <b>There,</b> in those cases involving consecrations, <i>terumot</i>, and tithes, <b>there is a change in name</b> of the stolen item, <b>as initially</b> the stolen food was called <b>untithed produce,</b> i.e., produce from which <i>teruma</i> and tithes have not been separated, <b>and now</b> it is called <b><i>teruma</i></b> or tithe. With regard to <b>consecration,</b> it was <b>initially</b> called <b>non-sacred</b> property, <b>and now</b> it is called <b>consecrated</b> property.
<b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a change</b> in a stolen item causes the thief to <b>acquire</b> it? <b>As it is stated: “And he shall return the stolen item that he took by robbery”</b> (Leviticus 5:23). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the seemingly superfluous phrase <b>“that he took by robbery”?</b> It teaches that only <b>if</b> the item is in the same state <b>as when he took it by robbery</b> it <b>he must return</b> it. <b>But if not, he is required to pay only money;</b> the stolen item remains his to keep.
The Gemara asks with regard to this derivation: <b>But this</b> phrase: <b>“That he took by robbery,” is required to exclude</b> the case of an item <b>stolen by one’s father,</b> i.e., <b>that</b> when a son returns an item or money that his father had stolen, <b>he does not add one-fifth to</b> the principal amount of that which <b>his father stole.</b> The passage in question addresses one who stole and took a false oath. This individual is obligated to add one-fifth to the amount he stole (see Leviticus 5:21–24). The apparently redundant phrase “that he took by robbery,” teaches that the requirement to add one-fifth applies only to the sinner himself, not to his heirs (see 104b).
The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> if the verse teaches only that <i>halakha</i>, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> merely: <b>And he shall return his stolen item,</b> as from that phrase alone it could be derived that an heir does not have to add one-fifth. <b>Why do I</b> need the Torah <b>to write</b> the expression <b>“that he took by robbery”?</b> One may therefore <b>conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from</b> this verse: A son need not add one-fifth, and a change in a stolen item effects acquisition for the thief.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of the above statement: <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: From where</b> is it derived that <b>a change</b> in a stolen item <b>does not</b> cause the thief to <b>acquire</b> it? <b>As it is stated: “And he shall return the stolen item that he took by robbery”</b> (Leviticus 5:23), from which it may be inferred that he must return it <b>in any case,</b> even if it has undergone a change. The Gemara asks: <b>But it is written “that he took by robbery,”</b> which indicates that, on the contrary, the item need be returned only if it is in a similar state to when it was stolen. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> phrase <b>is required</b> to teach another <i>halakha</i>: <b>One adds one-fifth upon</b> returning <b>his own stolen</b> item concerning which he had taken a false oath, <b>but he does not add one-fifth upon</b> returning something <b>stolen by his father.</b>
<b>Ulla says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovering his stolen item <b>does not</b> cause the thief to <b>acquire</b> it? <b>As it is stated</b> in the criticism of the Jewish people for bringing inferior animals as offerings: <b>“And you have brought that which is stolen, and the lame, and the sick”</b> (Malachi 1:13). From the juxtaposition of these cases it may be derived that <b>a stolen</b> animal <b>is similar to a lame</b> animal: <b>Just as a lame</b> animal <b>has no rectification at all</b> with regard to its disqualification as an offering,

Daf 67b

<b>so too a stolen</b> animal <b>has no rectification</b> for its disqualification. There is <b>no difference whether</b> one is dealing with a stolen animal <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovering it, <b>and</b> there is <b>no difference</b> if it is <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair.</b> In either case, it is disqualified. This shows that the owner’s despair does not effect acquisition for the thief.
<b>Rava said:</b> This <i>halakha</i> may be derived <b>from here,</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The verse: “If his offering is a burnt-offering of the herd” (Leviticus 1:3), indicates that one’s offering must be <b>“his offering,” but not</b> an animal <b>stolen</b> from another. <b>When,</b> i.e., in which circumstances, is it necessary to teach this <i>halakha</i>? <b>If we say</b> it is dealing with a stolen animal that the robber consecrated and sacrificed <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovery, <b>why do I</b> need <b>a verse</b> to teach this? It <b>is obvious</b> that it is disqualified, as one cannot even consecrate an animal that does not belong to him.
<b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to one who seeks to consecrate and sacrifice a stolen animal <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair?</b> And yet the <i>baraita</i> teaches that the animal cannot be consecrated by the thief. <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovering a stolen item <b>does not</b> cause the thief to <b>acquire</b> it, as if it belonged to him he would be able to consecrate and sacrifice it. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that it is so.
The Gemara asks: <b>But Rava was the one who said</b> that this proof can be refuted, as the <i>baraita</i> can be interpreted as dealing with one <b>who robbed another of an offering</b> that was already consecrated. Rava apparently contradicts himself. The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that Rava <b>retracted</b> one of these two statements. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>Rav Pappa,</b> not Rava, <b>said one of these</b> two statements.
§ The Gemara returns to the mishna, which teaches: <b>But the principle of fourfold or fivefold payment</b> applies only to the theft of an ox or a sheep, as it is stated: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, and slaughter it or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep” (Exodus 21:37).
The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is the fourfold and fivefold payment limited to oxen and sheep? <b>Let us derive</b> otherwise by a verbal analogy of the term <b>“ox”</b> in this verse and <b>“ox” from</b> a passage dealing with <b>Shabbat,</b> where it is stated: “And the seventh day is Sabbath to the Lord your God, you shall not perform any labor, you, your son, and your daughter, and your slave, and your maidservant, and your ox, and your donkey, and all your animals, and the gentile that is within your gates” (Deuteronomy 5:13). <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to Shabbat, the <i>halakha</i> stated with regard to an ox is not limited to oxen, as <b>undomesticated animals and fowl are similar to</b> oxen in that they too are included in this prohibition, as the verse states: “Nor any of your animals,” <b>so too here,</b> in the case of theft, one can say that <b>undomesticated animals and fowl are similar to</b> oxen in that the fourfold or fivefold payment is incurred for their theft.
<b>Rava said: The verse</b> dealing with theft <b>states “ox” and “sheep,” “ox” and “sheep” twice.</b> This repetition indicates that for <b>an ox and a sheep, yes,</b> there is a fourfold or fivefold payment, and <b>for other items, no,</b> there is no fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara <b>says,</b> with regard to Rava’s assertion that one of the instances of “ox” and “sheep” is superfluous: <b>Which</b> instance of the word “ox” or “sheep” <b>is</b> the <b>superfluous</b> one? <b>If we say</b> that the instance of <b>“ox” and “sheep” at the end</b> of the verse <b>is superfluous, due to</b> the following consideration: <b>Let the Merciful One write: If one steal an ox or a sheep, and slaughter it or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for it and four sheep for it,</b> without repeating the words “ox” and “sheep,” this is not possible. <b>If the Merciful One had written</b> the verse <b>like this, I would say</b> that the thief is <b>required to pay nine</b> animals, five oxen and four sheep, <b>for each and every</b> animal stolen.
<b>And if you would say</b> that this interpretation is not possible, as the suggestion is that the verse would have <b>written: For it, for it,</b> twice, whereas if a payment of nine animals were required for each stolen animal the verse would have written: For it, only once; then <b>one</b> mention of: <b>For it, is superfluous,</b> to teach us that it is five for an ox and four for a sheep.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>That</b> repetition of: For it, <b>is required for another interpretation,</b> and cannot teach that it is five for an ox and four for a sheep. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that if one <b>stole</b> an expensive <b>ox worth one hundred dinars he may pay for it</b> with <b>lean,</b> inferior <b>animals [<i>negidin</i>].</b> To counter this, <b>the verse states: “For</b> the ox” and <b>“for</b> the sheep,” which indicates that the oxen and sheep used for payment must be similar to the stolen animal in quality. Since one might have erred and understood that the thief is required to pay nine animals, five oxen and four sheep, for each and every animal stolen, that suggested version of the verse is not a possibility. The words “ox” and “sheep” at the end of the verse could not have been omitted, so they are not superfluous.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather,</b> the words <b>“ox” and “sheep” in the first</b> part of the verse <b>are superfluous, due to</b> the following consideration: <b>Let the Merciful One write: If a man steal, and slaughter it or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for the ox, and four sheep for the sheep,</b> without mentioning “ox” or “sheep” at the beginning of the verse.
The Gemara objects: It is not possible for the verse to have been written this way, as <b>if the Merciful One had written</b> it in <b>this</b> manner <b>I would say:</b> A thief is not required to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>unless he steals two</b> animals, an ox and a sheep, <b>and slaughters them</b> both. The Gemara responds: One could not interpret the verse in this manner, as it <b>is written: “And slaughter it.”</b> The singular pronoun “it” is referring <b>to</b> the slaughter of only <b>one</b> animal.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> one could <b>say</b> that a thief is not required to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>unless he steals both</b> of these animals, an ox and a sheep, <b>and sells them</b> both. The Gemara rejects this suggestion in a similar manner: This interpretation is also not possible, as it is <b>written: “Or sell it,”</b> which is referring <b>to</b> the sale of only <b>one</b> animal.
The Gemara further asks: <b>But</b> one could <b>say</b> a different interpretation: <b>I would say</b> that a thief is not required to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>unless he steals two</b> animals, an ox and a sheep, <b>and slaughters one</b> of them <b>and sells</b> the other <b>one.</b> The Gemara rejects this suggestion as well: This interpretation is impossible, as it is <b>written:</b> “And slaughter it <b>or sell it.”</b> The term “or” indicates that only one of these two actions results in paying the penalty.
The Gemara asks: <b>But still,</b> had the verse been worded without mentioning an ox or sheep at the start, <b>I would say:</b> A thief does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>unless he steals two</b> animals, an ox and a sheep, <b>and slaughters one</b> of them <b>and leaves</b> the other <b>one, or sells one and leaves</b> the other <b>one.</b> It is therefore impossible to omit the words “ox” and “sheep” in the beginning of the verse, which means that these words are not superfluous.
The Gemara gives its final explanation of Rava’s statement: <b>Rather, “ox” at the end</b> of the verse <b>and “sheep” in the first</b> part of the verse <b>are superfluous, due to</b> the following consideration: <b>Let the Merciful One write: If a man steal an ox and slaughter it or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for it, and four sheep for a sheep. Why do I</b> need the word <b>“ox” at the end</b> of the verse <b>and</b> the word <b>“sheep” in the first</b> part of the verse? <b>Conclude from</b> these apparently superfluous words that for <b>an ox and a sheep, yes,</b> a thief is obligated to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, but for stealing <b>other items, no,</b> he is not.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One who steals</b> an item <b>after a thief</b> has already stolen it, i.e., one who steals a stolen item, <b>does not pay</b> the <b>double payment</b> to the thief or to the prior owner. Rather, he pays the principal amount alone. <b>Rav says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case where the second thief stole from the first thief <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovering his item. <b>But</b> if the second thief stole it <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair, the first thief had acquired</b> the stolen item for himself as a result of the owner’s despair, <b>and the second thief pays</b> the <b>double payment to the first thief,</b> who at the time of the second theft was its legal owner.
<b>Rav Sheshet said: I say</b> that <b>when Rav was sleepy and lying down</b> to rest <b>he said this <i>halakha</i>,</b> i.e., he did not give it enough thought. This ruling is incorrect, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva said: For what reason did the Torah say that</b> if a thief <b>slaughtered or sold</b> a stolen ox or sheep <b>he pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment?</b> It is <b>because</b> by selling or slaughtering the animal the thief <b>becomes</b> more <b>deeply entrenched in sin.</b> Rav Sheshet analyzes Rabbi Akiva’s statement: <b>When</b> did this sale of the stolen animal take place? <b>If we say</b> it occurred <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovering his property,

Daf 68a

<b>is</b> it possible to say that <b>there</b> is any <b>entrenchment</b> in sin? The sale does not take effect, as it occurred before the owner despaired, which means that the thief did not in fact deepen his sin by selling the animal. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that the sale occurred <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair. And if it enters your mind</b> that the owner’s <b>despair</b> causes the thief to <b>acquire</b> the animal, <b>why does he pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment?</b> Since the animal belongs to him after the owner’s despair, in effect <b>he slaughters his own</b> animal or <b>sells his own</b> animal.
The Sages <b>say:</b> It is possible to explain the term: Entrenched in sin, <b>in accordance with</b> what <b>Rava said:</b> The thief is liable <b>because he repeated</b> his <b>sin,</b> i.e., he sinned a second time by going through the motions of the sale, regardless of the fact the sale was not legally binding. <b>Here too,</b> one can say that the thief is liable <b>because he repeated</b> his <b>sin.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, <b>and slaughter it or sell it”</b> (Exodus 21:37). <b>Just as slaughter</b> is an act <b>that cannot be undone, so too</b> the <b>selling</b> referred to here is an act <b>that cannot be undone.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: Now, <b>when</b> is a sale irreversible? <b>If we say</b> this sale occurred <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovering his stolen animal, <b>why can it not be undone?</b> Since the thief’s sale of the animal before the owner’s despair is ineffective, the sale is easily undone. <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must be speaking about a case where the thief sold the animal <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair. And if it enters your mind</b> that a thief <b>acquires</b> a stolen item after the owner’s despair, <b>why does he pay the fourfold or fivefold payment</b> for slaughtering or selling the animal at this point? <b>He slaughters his own</b> animal or <b>he sells his own</b> animal. Apparently, a thief does not acquire the stolen item after the owner’s despair.
The Gemara rejects this proof: The explanation for this <i>baraita</i> is <b>as Rav Naḥman said</b> in reference to a different <i>baraita</i>. Rav Naḥman said that when that <i>baraita</i> speaks of a sale that cannot be undone, this <b>excludes one who transferred</b> ownership of the animal to another in a temporary manner, e.g., <b>for thirty days. Here too,</b> one can answer in the same way, that it <b>excludes one who transferred</b> ownership of the animal <b>for thirty days.</b> Accordingly, if one sold the animal permanently, even if the sale was performed before the owner despaired and is therefore not legally binding, he is nevertheless required to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>stole</b> an animal, <b>and another</b> person subsequently <b>came and stole it</b> from him, <b>the first</b> thief <b>pays double payment</b> to the owner, <b>and the second</b> thief <b>pays only the principal</b> to the first thief. This is because one who steals from a thief does not pay the double payment, as the mishna teaches.
If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and sold</b> it, <b>and another</b> individual <b>came and stole it</b> from the purchaser, <b>the first</b> thief <b>pays the fourfold or fivefold payment</b> to the owner, <b>and the second</b> thief <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment</b> to the purchaser, who has become the new owner of the animal. If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered it, and another</b> person <b>came and stole</b> the slaughtered animal, <b>the first</b> thief <b>pays the fourfold or fivefold payment</b> to the owner, <b>and the second</b> thief <b>does not pay</b> the <b>double payment but only the principal,</b> in accordance with the <i>halakha</i> that one who steals from a thief does not pay the double payment.
The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> in <b>the middle clause:</b> If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and sold</b> it, <b>and another came and stole it</b> from the purchaser, <b>the first</b> thief <b>pays the fourfold or fivefold payment</b> to the owner, <b>and the second</b> thief <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment</b> to the purchaser.
<b>When</b> did this sale occur? <b>If we say</b> it happened <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair, why does</b> the second thief <b>pay</b> the <b>double payment</b> to the purchaser? <b>Is there anyone who says that a change in possession</b> of a stolen item, i.e., when it leaves the possession of the thief and enters the possession of another, <b>without</b> the additional factor of the owner’s <b>despair,</b> causes the one who has it to <b>acquire</b> the item? There is no such opinion. Therefore, the so-called purchaser of the animal does not become its owner, as the sale is invalid. This should be considered as a case of one who steals from a thief, and consequently there should be no double payment.
<b>Rather, it is obvious</b> that the sale occurred <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair. And if it enters your mind</b> that a thief <b>acquires</b> a stolen item after the owner’s <b>despair, why</b> should the first thief <b>pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment?</b> After all, <b>it is his own</b> animal <b>that he sold,</b> having acquired it immediately upon the owner’s despair.
<b>And furthermore,</b> consider <b>that</b> which the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> in <b>the first clause:</b> If one <b>stole</b> an animal, <b>and another</b> subsequently <b>came and stole it</b> from him, <b>the first</b> thief <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment</b> to the owner, <b>and the second</b> thief <b>pays only the principal</b> to the first thief.
<b>Now,</b> in this <i>baraita</i> <b>we are dealing with</b> a situation <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair,</b> as the Gemara just established. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the owner’s <b>despair</b> causes the thief to <b>acquire</b> the item, <b>why does</b> the <b>second</b> thief <b>pay only the principal?</b> After the owner has despaired of recovering his item, the thief becomes the owner of the item, and the second thief should have to pay him double payment for stealing his property. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that the owner’s <b>despair does not</b> cause the thief to <b>acquire</b> the item? <b>And</b> this presents <b>a difficulty to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav.</b>
<b>Rava said: And</b> can <b>you understand</b> that the text of <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is accurate? But</b> consider <b>that</b> which <b>it teaches</b> in <b>the last clause:</b> If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it, <b>and another came and stole</b> the slaughtered animal, the <b>first</b> thief <b>pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment</b> to the owner, <b>and the second</b> thief <b>pays only the principal</b> to the first thief. <b>And is there anyone who says that</b> a physical <b>change</b> brought about by <b>an action does not</b> cause the thief to <b>acquire</b> the item? There is no such opinion; the thief certainly becomes the owner of the animal after slaughtering it. Consequently, the second thief should have to pay the double payment to the thief for stealing his slaughtered animal. It must therefore be concluded that the text of the <i>baraita</i> has been corrupted and must be reformulated.
<b>Rather, actually the entire</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to the stage <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair. And</b> you must <b>reverse</b> the <i>halakha</i> stated in <b>the last clause with</b> that stated in <b>the middle clause, and</b> reverse the <i>halakha</i> stated in <b>the middle clause with</b> that stated in <b>the last clause, and say like this:</b> If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and sold</b> it, <b>and another came and stole it</b> from the purchaser, <b>the first</b> thief <b>pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment</b> to the owner, <b>and the second</b> thief <b>pays only the principal</b> to the purchaser, <b>as a change in possession without</b> the additional factor of owner’s <b>despair does not</b> cause one to <b>acquire</b> the item.
If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it, <b>and another came and stole</b> the slaughtered animal, <b>the first</b> thief <b>pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment</b> to the owner, <b>and the second</b> thief <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment</b> to the first thief, <b>as</b> the first thief <b>acquired</b> it through the physical <b>change</b> brought about by <b>an action,</b> i.e., slaughter.
<b>Rav Pappa said: Actually, do not reverse</b> the middle and last clauses of the <i>baraita</i>. With regard to the difficult <b>last clause, it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai, who say:</b> Even if an item has undergone a physical <b>change,</b> it <b>remains in its place,</b> i.e., a stolen item remains the property of the owner. A thief never attains ownership of it, even if it undergoes a physical change.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the <i>baraita</i> is not reversed, and if it is referring to the stage after the owner’s despair, then <b>the first clause and the middle clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> present <b>a difficulty to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav,</b> who maintains that after the owner’s despair the item belongs entirely to the thief.
<b>Rav Zevid said: Actually, the entire</b> <i>baraita</i> is dealing with the stage <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair. And with what are we dealing here,</b> in the middle clause of the <i>baraita</i>? We are dealing with a case <b>where the owners despaired</b> of recovering the item when it was already <b>in</b> the possession of the <b>purchaser, but they had not</b> yet <b>despaired</b> when the item was <b>in</b> the possession of the <b>thief.</b> The purchaser is considered the owner <b>because</b> after the despair occurred, <b>there were</b> two factors in play, both the owner’s <b>despair and a change in possession.</b> The combination of these two factors effects acquisition of the item on behalf of the purchaser.
Rav Zevid continues: <b>And do not say</b> that in the middle clause the reason the owner’s item is acquired by another is only <b>because we require</b> two factors, i.e., the owner’s <b>despair and change of possession. Rather, even</b> in a case <b>of</b> the owner’s <b>despair by itself,</b> the item <b>is acquired by the thief,</b> in accordance with Rav’s opinion that despair alone effects acquisition on behalf of the thief.
<b>Nevertheless,</b> the <i>baraita</i> chose a case in which both of these factors are present <b>because you will not find a case in which both of them, the first thief and the second thief, pay</b> a penalty <b>except in such</b> a case. The first thief pays the fourfold or fivefold payment, and the second thief pays the double payment. Had the owner despaired before the sale, the first thief would have been considered the owner and would therefore be exempt from the additional payment.
§ <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to a thief <b>who sells</b> a stolen animal <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair, Rav Naḥman says:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, despite the fact that the sale is invalid. <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> He is <b>exempt</b> from this payment.
The two <i>amora’im</i> explain the reasons for their respective rulings. <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> He is <b>liable,</b> because <b>the Merciful One states</b> with regard to the fourfold or fivefold payment: “And slaughter it <b>or sell it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), <b>and he has sold it.</b> There <b>is no difference</b> if the sale occurs <b>before despair,</b> and there <b>is no difference</b> if it takes place <b>after despair. Rav Sheshet says:</b> He is <b>exempt,</b> as <b>his liability is</b> in effect only if he sells the animal <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair, when his action,</b> i.e., the sale, <b>is effective. But</b> if he sells it <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair, when his action is not effective,</b> he <b>is not liable,</b> as <b>we require</b> that the sale be <b>similar to the slaughter,</b> as they are mentioned together, and <b>when</b> he slaughters the animal <b>his action is effective.</b>
<b>Rav Sheshet said: From where do I say</b> he is exempt? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva said: For what</b> reason <b>did the Torah say that</b> a thief <b>who slaughtered or sold</b> a stolen animal <b>pays the fourfold or fivefold payment?</b> It is <b>because he has become entrenched in sin</b> by slaughtering or selling the animal he stole.
Rav Sheshet analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>When</b> did this sale, referred to by Rabbi Akiva, occur? <b>If we say</b> that it happened <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair, is</b> it possible that <b>there</b> is any <b>entrenchment</b> in sin here? A sale before the owner’s despair is invalid, which means there is no deepening of his earlier sin. <b>Rather, is it not</b> the case that this <b>is</b> referring to a sale <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair? Rava said:</b> This is not a proof, as one can explain that the thief is entrenched in sin <b>because he repeated</b> his <b>sin,</b> i.e. sinned a second time, by his act of sale, regardless of the fact that the sale is invalid.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for the opinion of Rav Sheshet from a different <i>baraita</i>: It is written: <b>“And slaughter it or sell it”</b> (Exodus 21:37). <b>Just as slaughter</b> is an act <b>that cannot be undone, so too</b> the <b>selling</b> referred to here is an act <b>that cannot be undone.</b> The Gemara analyzes this <i>baraita</i>: <b>When</b> did this sale take place? <b>If we say</b> that it happened <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovering his stolen item, <b>why can it not be undone?</b> The thief’s sale of the animal is invalid before the owner’s despair, and therefore the sale is easily undone. <b>Rather,</b> it must be referring to a sale that took place <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair. And</b> one can <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that there is <b>liability</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment only if the animal is sold <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair. Rav Naḥman</b> rejected this proof, as he <b>interpreted</b> that <i>baraita</i> as serving to <b>exclude one who transferred</b> ownership of the animal temporarily, e.g., <b>for thirty days.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>And Rabbi Elazar also holds</b> that <b>the liability</b> of a thief to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment applies if he sells it <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> of recovering his stolen animal, <b>as Rabbi Elazar says:</b>

Daf 68b

<b>Know that an ordinary</b> case of <b>theft is</b> assumed to result in <b>the owner’s despair</b> of recovering the stolen item. In other words, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, one may assume that the victim of theft has despaired of recovering his item.
The reason is <b>that the Torah stated</b> that if a thief <b>slaughtered or sold</b> the animal he had stolen, <b>he pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment. But</b> why is this so? <b>Perhaps</b> the owner <b>did not</b> yet <b>despair</b> at the time the thief sold the animal, in which case the sale is invalid, and there should be no fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>Rather, is it not because we say that an ordinary</b> case of <b>theft is</b> assumed to result in <b>the owner’s despair</b> of recovering the stolen item? This concludes the statement of Rabbi Elazar, which clearly indicates that there is no fourfold or fivefold payment if the animal is sold before the owner’s despair.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rabbi Elazar’s assumption: <b>But perhaps</b> the Torah obligates the thief to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>even if</b> the owner has <b>not</b> yet <b>despaired</b> at the time of the sale, despite the fact that the sale is invalid, as Rav Naḥman stated.
In response to this question the Sages <b>say:</b> This <b>cannot enter your mind,</b> as Rabbi Elazar maintains that the juxtaposition of slaughtering and selling in the verse that states: “And slaughter it or sell it,” teaches that the thief’s sale of the animal is <b>similar to</b> his <b>slaughter</b> of it. <b>Just as slaughter</b> is a matter in <b>which his action was effective, so too,</b> the case of <b>selling</b> the animal is one in <b>which his action was effective,</b> i.e., the sale is valid. <b>And if</b> the sale occurred <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair,</b> in <b>what</b> sense were his actions <b>effective?</b>
The Gemara asks another question with regard to Rabbi Elazar’s reasoning: <b>But perhaps</b> the Torah requires the fourfold or fivefold payment only in the specific case <b>where</b> the animal is sold after <b>we heard that</b> the owner <b>despaired</b> of its recovery. The Sages respond to this and <b>say:</b> This <b>cannot enter your mind,</b> since, as explained above, the thief’s sale of the animal must be <b>similar to</b> his <b>slaughter</b> of it. Therefore, <b>just as</b> the thief is liable to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment for <b>slaughtering</b> the animal even if he does so <b>immediately, so too,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment for <b>selling</b> it applies even if he does so <b>immediately,</b> before it is known that the owner has despaired of recovering the animal.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: The case of <b>stealing a human being,</b> i.e., kidnapping, <b>proves</b> that your reasoning is incorrect. The Torah states: “And he who steals a man and sells him or if he is found in his hand, he shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:16). In this case <b>there is no owner’s despair,</b> as no one ever despairs of his own freedom. Consequently, the thief’s sale of the person he kidnapped is invalid, <b>and</b> yet the Torah states that he is <b>liable</b> to receive the death penalty for selling him. One can learn <b>by inference</b> from this question <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds</b> that if the thief sells the stolen animal <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
§ The Gemara asks: If the thief sells the animal <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He is <b>liable. And Reish Lakish says:</b> He is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He is <b>liable,</b> as the thief’s <b>liability</b> applies <b>whether</b> the animal is sold <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair or after</b> his <b>despair. Reish Lakish says:</b> He is <b>exempt,</b> as the thief’s <b>liability is</b> in effect only if he sells the animal <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair, but after</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> there is no liability, because the thief has <b>acquired</b> the animal by virtue of the owner’s despair, <b>and</b> therefore it is <b>his own</b> animal that <b>he slaughters or his own</b> animal that <b>he sells.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and consecrated</b> it, <b>and subsequently slaughtered</b> it, <b>he pays</b> the <b>double payment</b> to the owner of the animal, <b>but he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> The Torah states: “The one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8). The word “neighbor” excludes the case of one who steals a consecrated item from the Temple treasury. Since there is no double payment to the Temple treasury there can be no fourfold or fivefold payment either, as the fourfold or fivefold payment is considered an addition to, not a replacement of, of the double payment (see 75a). Therefore, a thief does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment to the Temple treasury for slaughtering one of its animals.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>When</b> did the events described in the <i>baraita</i> occur? <b>If we say</b> they happened <b>before</b> the owner’s <b>despair, is</b> the animal <b>consecrated</b> at all? A thief cannot consecrate a stolen item before the owner despairs of recovering it, as <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “And <b>when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:14), from which it is derived: <b>Just as one’s house belongs to him, so too, anything</b> that one consecrates must <b>belong to him,</b> and therefore a thief cannot consecrate a stolen item.
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with events that occurred <b>after</b> the owner’s <b>despair. And</b> yet <b>the</b> only <b>reason that he does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment is that he consecrated</b> the animal, on the grounds <b>that when he slaughtered</b> it <b>he slaughtered consecrated</b> property. <b>But</b> if <b>he did not consecrate</b> the animal before <b>he slaughtered</b> it <b>he would pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. And if it enters your mind that</b> the owner’s <b>despair</b> serves to <b>acquire</b> the animal for the thief, <b>why</b> would he have to <b>pay?</b> At that point it is <b>his own</b> animal that <b>he slaughters or his own</b> animal that <b>he sells.</b>
Reish Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case that occurred before the owner’s despair, and it is not the thief who consecrated the animal, as he cannot do so. Rather, we are dealing with a case <b>where the owner consecrated the animal</b> while it was <b>in the thief’s possession.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> the animal <b>consecrated</b> in this situation? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say:</b> If one <b>stole</b> an item <b>and the owner has not</b> yet <b>despaired</b> of recovering it, <b>neither of them is able to consecrate</b> it. <b>This</b> one, the thief, cannot consecrate the item, <b>because it does not belong to him; and that</b> one, the owner, cannot consecrate it, <b>because it is not in his possession.</b> The Sages <b>state</b> an answer on behalf of Reish Lakish: <b>He stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the pious ones [<i>tzenuin</i>],</b> who acted not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 5:1): <b>The pious ones would set aside</b> some <b>coins and say: Anything that was picked from this</b> vine by passersby <b>shall be desacralized onto these coins.</b> This mishna is referring to a grapevine in its fourth year after planting. The grapes on this vine must be either eaten in Jerusalem or redeemed with money that is then taken to Jerusalem and spent on food. The fruit may not be eaten outside Jerusalem without being redeemed. The pious ones were concerned that a passerby might help himself to some of their grapes, thereby transgressing a prohibition. Therefore, they would redeem any of their grapes that might be picked and eaten by passersby. Evidently, these pious ones were of the opinion that the owner of a stolen item can redeem it despite the fact that it is no longer in his possession. Likewise, they would say, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, that an owner of a stolen item can consecrate it even though it is no longer in his possession.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Reish Lakish’s explanation of the <i>baraita</i>, that it is discussing a case where the owner of the animal consecrated it after it was stolen: <b>But the principal</b> amount, i.e., the stolen animal itself, <b>has returned to the owner.</b> By consecrating the animal, the owner has exercised his ownership of it, and it is therefore considered to have been returned to him at that point. The thief should therefore not be required to pay the double payment, as a thief is liable for double payment only when the stolen item is in his possession at the time of the trial, as it states: “The theft shall be found in his hand” (Exodus 22:3).
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where</b> the thief <b>stood in judgment</b> and was found guilty of theft before the owner consecrated the animal. Consequently, the liability to pay the double payment preceded the owner’s consecration of his property.
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this answer: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this trial of the thief? <b>If</b> it refers to a situation <b>where</b> the members of the court <b>say</b> to him: <b>Go out</b> and <b>give</b> the animal back <b>to</b> its owner, <b>why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> say that the thief is exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>specifically</b> because the owner <b>consecrated</b> the animal before it was slaughtered? <b>Even if he did not consecrate it</b> the thief <b>should also not be liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara elaborates. <b>As Rava says:</b> If the court tells a thief: <b>Go out</b> and <b>give</b> the stolen animal back <b>to</b> the owner and instead the thief <b>slaughtered or sold</b> it, he is <b>exempt</b> from the fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>What is the reason</b> for this?
<b>Since</b> the court <b>has issued a definitive ruling in</b> this <b>matter, and he</b> later <b>slaughtered or sold</b> the animal, <b>he is considered a robber, and a robber does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> The difference between a thief, concerning whom the Torah prescribes the double payment and the fourfold or fivefold payment, and a robber, who does not incur these obligations, is that a thief acts stealthily, whereas a robber brazenly uses force to take an item from its owner. Once a court has obligated a thief to make restitution and he has defied this sentence, he is considered a robber, and therefore the fourfold or fivefold payment and its atonement are not applicable to him.

Daf 69a

Rava continues: But if the court says to the thief only: <b>You are obligated to give</b> the stolen animal back <b>to</b> its owner, without actually ordering him to pay, and <b>he</b> subsequently <b>slaughtered or sold</b> the animal, <b>he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Since</b> the court <b>has not issued a definitive ruling in</b> this <b>matter, he is still</b> considered <b>a thief</b> rather than a robber.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this is not a challenge to the ruling of Reish Lakish. It is <b>necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to state the <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where they say to him</b> only: <b>You are obligated to give</b> the stolen animal back <b>to</b> its owner. Consequently, he remains categorized as a thief.
§ The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>stole</b> an item <b>and the owner has not</b> yet <b>despaired</b> of recovering it, <b>neither of them is able to consecrate</b> it. <b>This</b> one, the thief, cannot consecrate it <b>because it does not belong to him, and that</b> one, the owner, cannot consecrate it <b>because it is not in his possession.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this? But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is invariably in accordance with the ruling of <b>an unattributed mishna,</b> i.e., a mishna that states a <i>halakha</i> without citing it in the name of a particular Sage?
<b>And</b> there is a mishna of this kind (<i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 5:1) that contradicts Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, as <b>we learned</b> in a mishna: With regard to <b>a vineyard in its fourth year, they would demarcate it with clods of earth [<i>bikzozot</i>]</b> placed around it on the ground, to alert people that they may not eat or derive any benefit from its grapes without redeeming them. The Gemara interrupts its quotation of the mishna to explain: This particular <b>distinguishing mark</b> of earth is used because a vineyard in its fourth year is <b>like earth: Just as</b> with regard to <b>earth there is</b> permission to derive <b>benefit from it</b> through its cultivation, <b>so too,</b> with <b>this</b> fruit, <b>when it has been redeemed</b> by means of coins, it is likewise <b>permitted to benefit from it.</b>
The Gemara resumes its citation from the mishna: <b>And</b> a grapevine <b>of <i>orla</i></b> is demarcated <b>with potsherds [<i>ḥarsit</i>]</b> placed around it, to alert people that its grapes may not be eaten nor may any benefit be derived from them at all (see Leviticus 19:23). The Gemara explains: This particular <b>distinguishing mark</b> is used because <i>orla</i> is <b>like potsherds: Just as no benefit</b> is derived <b>from potsherd, so too, no benefit</b> may be derived <b>from this</b> <i>orla</i>.
The mishna continues: <b>And</b> an area <b>of graves</b> is demarcated <b>with lime,</b> to notify people that the demarcated area is ritually impure and will impart impurity to those who pass over it. The Gemara explains: The reason this particular <b>distinguishing mark</b> is used is <b>that</b> lime is <b>white, like bones.</b> The mishna further states: <b>And</b> one <b>dissolves</b> the lime in water <b>and pours</b> it out around the gravesite. The Gemara explains: This is performed <b>in order that</b> the lime <b>should be whiter</b> than in its non-dissolved form.
The Gemara resumes the citation from the mishna. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that vineyards of the fourth year and of <i>orla</i> require demarcation, <b>said? During the Sabbatical</b> Year. The Gemara explains: The reason is <b>that</b> all fruit that grows during that year may be taken by anyone (see Leviticus 25:5–6), as in that year all fruit is considered to be <b>ownerless</b> property.
The mishna continues: <b>But during the other years of</b> the Sabbatical <b>cycle,</b> when anyone who takes the grapes of another is guilty of theft, there is no requirement to demarcate these vineyards. This is in accordance with the adage: <b>Feed it to the wicked man and let him die.</b> That is, one is not required to take precautions to protect the wicked from the consequences of their own sins. Here too, there is no obligation to warn a thief that the grapes he is stealing are prohibited.
The mishna continues: <b>But the pious ones would set aside</b> some <b>coins and say: Anything that was picked from this</b> vine by passersby <b>shall be desacralized onto these coins.</b> These pious ones maintain that the owner can desacralize the grapes despite the fact that they are no longer in his possession. Similarly, contrary to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, they would claim that an owner can consecrate a stolen item even though it is no longer in his possession. Since this opinion is cited in the mishna without being attributed to any particular Sage, Rabbi Yoḥanan should have accepted this ruling.
<b>And if you would say: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> that <b>taught</b> this practice of the <b>pious ones</b> in the mishna? It is <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and Rabbi Yoḥanan did not say</b> his principle that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with <b>an unattributed</b> mishna when it follows <b>an individual</b> opinion; this suggestion does not alleviate the difficulty.
The Gemara explains: <b>But doesn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Wherever Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel taught</b> a statement <b>in</b> the corpus of <b>our Mishna, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with his</b> opinion, <b>except for</b> the case of the responsibility of the <b>guarantor</b> (see <i>Bava Batra</i> 173b), <b>and</b> the incident that occurred in the city of <b>Tzaidan</b> (see <i>Gittin</i> 74a), <b>and</b> the dispute with regard to <b>evidence</b> in the <b>final</b> disagreement (see <i>Sanhedrin</i> 31a). Consequently, even if the opinion of the pious ones was cited by Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, Rabbi Yoḥanan should have accepted it as authoritative.
The Sages <b>say,</b> in explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: When quoting the declaration of the pious ones, <b>do not say</b> in the past tense: <b>Anything that was picked from this</b> vine by passersby shall be desacralized onto these coins. <b>Rather, say: Anything that will be picked from this</b> vine shall be desacralized onto these coins. In other words, the desacralizing is performed before the fruit is picked, while it is still in the full possession of the owner of the vine.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say such</b> a ruling? Could Rabbi Yoḥanan agree to this reformulation of the declaration of the pious ones? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: The pious ones and Rabbi Dosa said the same thing,</b> i.e., their opinions are equivalent? <b>And Rabbi Dosa says</b> that this declaration is formulated in the past tense, as: Anything <b>that was picked.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> In the <b>morning the homeowner,</b> i.e., the owner of a field, <b>stands and says: Anything that the poor will pick today</b> that is not rightfully theirs <b>shall</b> hereby <b>be</b> considered <b>ownerless</b> property. The poor are entitled to glean leftover grain from a field after it is harvested (Leviticus 23:22). Yet there are many <i>halakhot</i> involved in determining what produce they are entitled to take, and not all poor people are learned enough to know these <i>halakhot</i>. Consequently, there will inevitably be poor people who will take a certain amount of grain to which they are not entitled. For this reason, the owner of the field should relinquish, in advance, ownership over whatever the poor might unlawfully take.
<b>Rabbi Dosa says:</b> This is not the correct practice. Rather, <b>toward evening</b> the owner should <b>say: Anything that the poor picked</b> today that is not rightfully theirs <b>shall</b> hereby <b>be</b> considered <b>ownerless</b> property. Since Rabbi Yoḥanan stated that the opinions of the pious ones and Rabbi Dosa are the same, this indicates that the declaration of the pious ones was in the past tense, which means that they permitted redemption of fourth-year produce after it was already stolen. If so, the question remains: Why did Rabbi Yoḥanan not accept the ruling of the pious ones as authoritative?
The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda with</b> that of <b>Rabbi Dosa, and</b> that <b>of Rabbi Dosa with</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> According to this new version of the <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Dosa does not permit the owner of an item to exercise any control over it after it has been stolen from him. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do you reverse the <i>baraita</i></b> to avoid a contradiction between the statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan? It is better to <b>reverse</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> himself, <b>and say</b> that he actually stated: <b>The pious ones and Rabbi Yehuda said the same thing,</b> and leave the <i>baraita</i> intact.
The Gemara <b>says: There is no alternative, as</b> one <b>cannot</b> do otherwise than <b>to reverse the <i>baraita</i>, as</b> that would mean <b>that in this <i>baraita</i> it teaches that Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that there is a principle of retroactive <b>designation. And we have heard</b> elsewhere <b>that Rabbi Yehuda generally does not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>designation, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Demai</i> 7:4):

Daf 69b

In the case of <b>one who purchases wine from among the Samaritans [<i>Kutim</i>],</b> if there is reason to suspect that <i>teruma</i> and tithes were not separated, and he cannot separate them before the start of Shabbat, he acts as follows. If there are one hundred <i>log</i> of wine in the barrels, he <b>says: Two <i>log</i> that I will separate in the future are <i>teruma</i>,</b> as the mandated average measure of <i>teruma</i> is one-fiftieth; <b>ten</b> <i>log</i> are <b>first tithe;</b> and a tenth of the remainder, <b>nine</b> <i>log</i>, are <b>second tithe. And he desacralizes</b> the second tithe that he will separate in the future by transferring its sanctity onto money, <b>and he may drink</b> the wine <b>immediately,</b> relying on the separation that he will perform later. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Yosei, and Rabbi Shimon prohibit</b> one from doing so. The objection of these three Sages is presumably that this arrangement relies on the principle of retroactive designation, as at the time of the declaration the identity of the particular portions of wine that will be <i>teruma</i> and tithes is unknown, and these Sages do not accept this principle. It is apparent from this mishna that Rabbi Yehuda does not accept retroactive designation, and therefore he cannot be the one who said that the owner of the field may issue his declaration of relinquishment in the morning.
The Gemara <b>says: Ultimately, why do you reverse the <i>baraita</i></b> that contains the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Dosa? It is <b>because</b> there is <b>a difficulty</b> due to the contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda</b> and another statement <b>of Rabbi Yehuda. Now too,</b> although you have reversed the <i>baraita</i>, a similar problem remains, as there is <b>a difficulty</b> due to the contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and another statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>
<b>As you said, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan: Do not say</b> that <b>anything that was picked</b> from this vine by passersby shall be desacralized onto these coins. <b>Rather, say</b> that <b>anything that will be picked from this</b> vine shall be desacralized onto these coins. <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan here <b>accepts</b> the principle of retroactive <b>designation. But</b> it is established that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan does not accept</b> the principle of retroactive <b>designation.</b>
<b>As Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Brothers who divided</b> property received as an inheritance <b>are</b> considered <b>purchasers</b> from each other, <b>and</b> as purchasers of land <b>they must return</b> the portions <b>to each other in the Jubilee</b> Year, at which point they may redistribute the property. This demonstrates that Rabbi Yoḥanan does not hold that it is retroactively clarified that each brother’s portion was designated for him directly upon their father’s death, but rather all the land was considered joint property until the brothers traded or bought their respective portions from each other at the time of the distribution of the estate.
In light of this objection, the Gemara retracts its previous assertion that Rabbi Yoḥanan reformulated the declaration of the pious ones. <b>Rather,</b> the pious ones <b>actually</b> declared in the past tense: <b>Anything that was picked</b> from this vine by passersby shall be desacralized onto these coins, i.e., the desacralizing took place after the grapes were stolen. If so, the question remains: Why did Rabbi Yoḥanan not accept the opinion of the pious ones, but instead ruled that the owner of an item cannot consecrate it after it has been stolen?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan found a different unattributed</b> mishna, which contradicts the opinion of the pious ones. <b>As we learned</b> in the mishna here (62b): <b>One who steals</b> an item <b>after a thief</b> has already stolen it, i.e., one who steals a stolen item, <b>does not pay</b> the <b>double payment</b> to the thief or to the prior owner. <b>Why</b> not? <b>Granted</b> that <b>he does not pay to the first thief, as</b> the verse states: <b>“And it was stolen from the house of the man;</b> if the thief shall be found he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6), which indicates that the double payment applies in the case of an item “stolen from the house of the man,” i.e., from the owner’s jurisdiction, but <b>not</b> to an item stolen from <b>the thief’s house. But let him pay</b> the double payment <b>to the owner,</b> as it presumably still belonged to the owner when the second thief stole it.
<b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> this that a stolen item is not under the full jurisdiction of either the owner or the thief? It is not under the jurisdiction of <b>this</b> one, the first thief, <b>because it does not belong to him, and</b> it is not under the jurisdiction of <b>that</b> one, the owner, <b>because it is not in his possession.</b> Therefore, neither of them can consecrate the stolen item.
The Gemara asks: Granted that this unattributed mishna disagrees with the mishna that cites the pious ones, <b>but what did you see</b> that led you to <b>follow that unattributed</b> mishna, the one that discusses the double payment? <b>Let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>act,</b> i.e., rule, <b>in accordance with this unattributed</b> mishna, which states the practice <b>of the pious ones.</b> On what basis did he choose one mishna over the other?
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan followed the mishna that discusses the double payment <b>because</b> there is <b>a verse</b> that <b>supports it: “And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 27:14), from which it is derived: <b>Just as one’s house is in his possession, so too anything</b> that one consecrates must <b>be in his possession,</b> excluding items that have been stolen from him.
§ <b>Abaye said: If Rabbi Yoḥanan had not said</b> that <b>the pious ones and Rabbi Dosa said the same thing,</b> i.e., their rulings are identical, <b>I would say</b> that <b>the pious ones accept</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Dosa, but Rabbi Dosa does not accept</b> the opinion <b>of the pious ones.</b>
Abaye elaborates: <b>The pious ones accept</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Dosa,</b> for the following reason: <b>And if the Sages instituted an ordinance for</b> the sake of <b>a thief,</b> to prevent him from eating unredeemed fourth-year grapes, by allowing the owner to desacralize produce that is no longer in his possession, does it <b>need to be said</b> that they did so for the sake of innocent <b>poor people,</b> as Rabbi Dosa claimed? Conversely, <b>Rabbi Dosa does not accept</b> the opinion <b>of the pious ones,</b> as he says: It <b>is</b> for the sake of <b>poor people that the Sages instituted an ordinance; but the Sages did not institute an ordinance for</b> the sake of <b>a thief,</b> in line with the aforementioned principle: Feed it to the wicked man and let him die.
In a similar vein, <b>Rava said: If Rabbi Yoḥanan had not said</b> that <b>the pious ones and Rabbi Dosa said the same thing, I would say</b> that there is a fundamental difference between the cases of fourth-year produce and gleanings taken by the poor, as one could claim: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the ruling of the <b>pious ones? It is Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>Doesn’t Rabbi Meir say</b> that second <b>tithe is property</b> belonging to the <b>Most High,</b> rather than the possession of the one who separated it from his produce, <b>and even so, with regard to redemption</b> of the second tithe <b>the Merciful One establishes it in his possession? As it is written</b> concerning the second tithe: <b>“And if a man will redeem any of his tithe, he shall add to it its fifth part”</b> (Leviticus 27:31).
Although according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, second tithe does not belong to the owner of the produce from which it was separated, nevertheless, with regard to redemption <b>the Merciful One</b> does distinguish between a stranger and one who separated it from his produce, as the Torah <b>refers to</b> the second tithe as <b>“his tithe” and</b> thereby decrees that <b>he,</b> the owner of the crop from which it is separated, can redeem it by <b>adding one-fifth</b> to its value, but no one else can do so. This indicates that although second-tithe produce is not in fact owned by the person, the Torah treats him as the owner of the produce.
With regard to <b>a fourth-year vineyard as well,</b> the Sages <b>derive</b> many of its <i>halakhot</i> <b>from</b> a verbal analogy between <b>second tithe</b> and fourth-year fruit, based on the use of the word <b>“holy”</b> in the context of fourth-year fruit and <b>“holy”</b> in the context of second tithe. <b>It is written here,</b> concerning fourth-year fruit trees: “And in the fourth year all its fruit shall be <b>holy, for giving praise</b> to the Lord” (Leviticus 19:24), <b>and it is written with regard to second tithe: “And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s; it is holy”</b> (Leviticus 27:30).
From this analogy it is derived: <b>Just as</b> in the case of the term <b>“holy” that is written in connection to</b> second <b>tithe, even though it is property</b> belonging to the <b>Most High, with regard to redemption the Merciful One establishes it in</b> the <b>jurisdiction</b> of the one who separated it, <b>so too</b> in the context of the word <b>“holy” that is written in connection to</b> the <b>fourth-year vineyard, even though it is not his property,</b> as it belongs to the Most High, <b>with regard to desacralizing the Merciful One establishes it in</b> the vineyard owner’s <b>jurisdiction.</b>
The effect of this determination is <b>that</b> even <b>when</b> the fruit <b>is in his jurisdiction it is not his</b> property, <b>and</b> yet <b>he is able to desacralize it.</b> And <b>due to that</b> reason the owner of the vineyard <b>is able to desacralize</b> the fruit even after a thief has taken it. Even in normal circumstances when one desacralizes his fourth-year fruit he is desacralizing fruit that does not belong to him. Consequently, there is no novelty in the ruling that one can desacralize fruit even after it has been taken by a thief.
<b>But with regard to gleanings</b> of the poor, <b>since</b> the extra sheaves that the poor people inadvertently take <b>are the property of</b> the owner of the field, it may be claimed that only <b>when</b> those sheaves <b>are in his possession,</b> i.e., they have not been taken by anyone else, <b>can he relinquish</b> his <b>ownership of</b> them, whereas <b>when</b> they are <b>no</b> longer <b>in his possession he cannot relinquish</b> his <b>ownership of</b> them. Consequently, the pious ones, who permitted redemption of fourth-year produce after it had been stolen, would not necessarily agree with Rabbi Dosa, who allowed the relinquishment of stolen sheaves.
In a similar vein, <b>Ravina said: If Rabbi Yoḥanan had not said</b> that <b>the pious ones and Rabbi Dosa said the same thing, I would say: Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> the opinion of the <b>pious ones? It is Rabbi Dosa.</b> I would have said this <b>so that an unattributed mishna should not</b> present <b>a difficulty to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan. And</b> the reason why this would have resolved the difficulty is that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b>

Daf 70a

<b>did not say</b> to apply his principle, that the <i>halakha</i> is always in accordance with <b>an unattributed</b> mishna, in a case where the mishna expresses the opinion of <b>an individual</b> Sage. According to this interpretation Rabbi Yoḥanan does not rule in accordance with the mishna, due to the fact that it represents the opinion of an individual Sage, Rabbi Dosa. Rather, he follows the majority opinion. Yet now that Rabbi Yoḥanan said that the pious ones and Rabbi Dosa said the same thing, it cannot be claimed that they are one and the same Sage. Consequently, the ruling of the mishna is evidently accepted by at least two Sages, and therefore the difficulty from the mishna cannot be resolved by assigning it to a single Sage.
§ The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: One cannot write a document of authorization [<i>orakhta</i>]</b> to assign another to collect a debt or a deposit <b>of movable property</b> on his behalf. <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: What is the reason</b> for this <i>halakha</i>? Ameimar <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>due to</b> a principle stated <b>by Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>
<b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>stole</b> an item <b>and the owners have not</b> yet <b>despaired</b> of recovering it, <b>neither of them is able to consecrate</b> it: <b>This</b> one, the thief, cannot consecrate the item <b>because it does not belong to him, and that</b> one, the owner, cannot consecrate it <b>because it is not in his possession.</b> The granting of authority to collect a debt involves the transfer of ownership of the item or money from the owner to the collector; otherwise the debtor could refuse to convey it to the collector. In the case of movable property, as it is being held by another, it is not in the possession of the owner; just as the owner cannot consecrate this item he cannot transfer ownership of it.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who state</b> a different version of this <i>halakha</i>. The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: One cannot write a document of authorization for</b> the collection of <b>movable property that</b> the bailee or debtor <b>has denied</b> owing. The Gemara infers: According to this version, the only <b>reason</b> the document cannot be written is <b>that</b> the bailee or debtor <b>has denied</b> owing the item, <b>as</b> a document written under these circumstances <b>has the appearance of falsehood,</b> since the purported owner is transferring ownership of an item over which his own ownership is in doubt. <b>But</b> it can be inferred that <b>if</b> the bailee or debtor <b>did not deny</b> owing the item, <b>one can write</b> a document of authorization.
<b>And</b> the Sages <b>of Neharde’a state</b> another <i>halakha</i> with regard to this kind of document: <b>A document of authorization in which it is not written: Go</b> and <b>take legal action</b> against so-and-so <b>and take</b> possession of the owed property <b>and collect it</b> from him <b>for yourself, has no substance,</b> i.e., it is not a valid document. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>because the other</b> party, the bailee or debtor, <b>can say</b> to the collector who presents a document without this clause: <b>I am not legally answerable to you;</b> I am willing to deal only with the person to whom the item is owed. To avoid this situation, the authorization document must transfer actual ownership of the item to the collector, who is now claiming it for himself.
<b>Abaye said: And if it is written</b> in the document that the owner transferred ownership <b>of</b> only <b>half</b> of the item to the collector, <b>or a third or a quarter</b> of it, this is sufficient. The reason is that <b>since</b> the bailee or debtor must <b>relate</b> to the <b>judgment,</b> i.e., engage in litigation with the collector, <b>over</b> the <b>half</b> or third or quarter of the item that has been transferred to the collector, he must <b>relate</b> to the <b>judgment concerning all of it.</b>
<b>Ameimar said: If</b> the collector who is empowered by the authorization <b>seized</b> the item he collected and kept it for himself, the court <b>does not take it away from him,</b> as the owner transferred ownership of the item to him in the document of authorization, as explained above. <b>Rav Ashi</b> disagreed with Ameimar and <b>said: Since</b> the owner <b>wrote to</b> the collector: <b>I accept upon myself anything that develops as a result of</b> this <b>legal process, he has</b> in effect <b>rendered</b> the collector <b>an agent</b> to act on his behalf, and therefore the agent cannot seize the item for himself.
<b>And there is</b> another opinion <b>that states:</b> The owner <b>renders the</b> collector <b>a partner</b> in the collected item, transferring ownership of half of it to him while maintaining ownership over the other half. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> between this opinion and that of Rav Ashi? The Gemara answers: The difference is whether the collector has the power <b>to seize half</b> of the collected item for himself. If he is merely an agent of the owner, he cannot seize anything; if he is a partner he can seize up to half. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that the owner <b>renders</b> the collector his <b>agent,</b> and therefore this agent may not seize any portion of the collected item for himself.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The mishna lists a series of cases in which a thief is required to pay the fourfold or fivefold penalty. If one <b>stole</b> an animal, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>or sold</b> it, also <b>based on</b> the testimony of the same witnesses, <b>or based on</b> the testimony of <b>two other</b> witnesses, he <b>pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and sold</b> it <b>on Shabbat,</b> or if <b>he stole</b> it <b>and sold</b> it <b>for idol worship,</b> or if <b>he stole</b> it <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>on Yom Kippur,</b> he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. Although his sale or slaughter in these circumstances involved a sin, he is not liable to receive the death penalty for the sale and must consequently pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>of his father’s and</b> then <b>slaughtered</b> it <b>or sold</b> it, <b>and afterward his father died</b> and he inherited his father’s estate either on his own or in partnership with his brothers, or if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>and afterward he consecrated</b> it, he <b>pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
In the case of one who <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered it,</b> not for the purpose of eating its meat, but to use it <b>for medicinal purposes or to</b> feed the meat to <b>dogs,</b> and likewise a thief <b>who slaughters</b> the animal to eat its meat <b>but it was found to be an animal with a condition that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> or a thief <b>who slaughters a non-sacred</b> animal <b>in the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> he <b>pays the fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon exempts</b> the thief from the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>in these</b> last <b>two</b> cases, as he maintains that the legal status of an act of slaughter that is not fit for accomplishing its full ritual purpose is not considered an act of slaughter.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if two witnesses testify about the theft of an animal and two others testify about its slaughter or sale, the thief pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> in his exposition of the verse: “Based on the testimony of two witnesses or on the testimony of three witnesses shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15).
The Gemara elaborates: <b>As, if</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> the thief would be exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment, as <b>doesn’t</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>say</b> that this verse teaches that witnesses’ testimony must refer to an entire <b>matter, and not part of a matter?</b> In the case discussed by the mishna the second set of witnesses testifies only that this man slaughtered or sold an ox or sheep, not that he stole it, and therefore their testimony alone would not render the thief liable to pay anything.
<b>As it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Bava Batra</i> 2:4) that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: When father Ḥalafta went to study Torah with Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, and some say</b> that he said: When <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri</b> went to study <b>Torah with father</b>

Daf 70b

<b>Ḥalafta,</b> he <b>said to him</b> the following in the course of their discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of possession.
If one has been in possession of real estate for three years, this serves as proof of his claim that he is the legal owner. One who is able to prove uninterrupted possession for the necessary period is not required to produce documentary evidence of his legal title to the property. Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri or father Ḥalafta asked: <b>If</b> one harvested and <b>ate</b> the produce of a field that he claims as his own the <b>first year</b> of the three years required for establishing possession of the land <b>in the presence of two</b> witnesses, and subsequently ate the produce of the <b>second</b> year <b>in the presence of two</b> other witnesses, and finally ate the produce of the <b>third</b> year <b>in the presence of</b> yet <b>two</b> other witnesses, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Can the three testimonies combine to establish full testimony that he ate the produce of three years, thereby confirming his ownership of the field?
Rabbi Ḥalafta <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri, or vice versa: <b>This is</b> considered to establish <b>presumptive ownership</b> by the one who ate the produce. The other Sage <b>said to him: I too say</b> that this is <b>so, but Rabbi Akiva disputes</b> this <b>matter, as Rabbi Akiva would say:</b> The Torah requires that witnesses must testify with regard to a complete <b>matter and not part of a matter.</b> Since there must be testimony concerning consumption of the produce over three years, and each set of witnesses establishes only that it took place for one year, their separate testimonies do not combine. If so, the mishna is apparently not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva.
The Gemara rejects this assertion. <b>Abaye said: You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. Doesn’t Rabbi Akiva concede</b> that <b>in</b> a case where <b>two</b> witnesses <b>say:</b> So-and-so <b>betrothed</b> a certain woman, <b>and two</b> other witnesses <b>say:</b> Someone else subsequently <b>engaged in sexual intercourse</b> with that same woman, this is proof that the act of intercourse was adulterous?
The reason for this is <b>that even though the witnesses</b> testifying about the <b>intercourse require the witnesses</b> who testify about the <b>betrothal,</b> i.e., the testimony of the second set of witnesses is meaningless without the testimony of the first witnesses, nevertheless, <b>since the witnesses</b> testifying about the <b>betrothal do not require the witnesses</b> who testify about the <b>intercourse,</b> i.e., their testimony by itself establishes a halakhic status, <b>we call</b> the testimony of each pair a complete <b>matter.</b>
<b>Here too,</b> the same logic applies in the case of a thief who steals an animal and subsequently slaughters or sells it: <b>Even though the witnesses</b> who testify about the <b>slaughter require the</b> testimony of the <b>witnesses</b> about the <b>theft</b> in order for their testimony to have any halakhic significance, <b>since the witnesses</b> testifying about the <b>theft do not require the</b> testimony of the <b>witnesses</b> who testify about the <b>slaughter,</b> as their testimony alone establishes that person as a thief who is liable to pay the double payment, <b>we call</b> the testimony of each pair a complete <b>matter.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Akiva that the Torah stipulates that testimony must be about <b>a matter and not half of a matter,</b> the term “matter” (Deuteronomy 19:15) serves <b>to exclude what?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to exclude</b> a case involving testimony that a girl has reached majority, in which <b>one</b> witness <b>says</b> that he saw <b>one</b> hair on <b>her</b> lower <b>back, and one</b> witness <b>says</b> that he saw <b>one</b> hair on <b>her</b> lower <b>abdomen.</b> A girl is considered to have reached maturity when she has two pubic hairs. In this case, two witnesses separately testify that they have each seen one hair, and therefore each testimony is halakhically meaningless on its own. The Rabbis derive from the verse that these testimonies do not combine.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: In <b>this</b> case each testimony is obviously invalid, as it is <b>half a matter and</b> also <b>half a testimony.</b> Not only does each testimony refer to one hair, which is half a matter, it is submitted by one witness, which is half a testimony. Consequently, it is obvious that the girl is not considered of age in this case.
The Gemara therefore rejects this explanation. <b>Rather,</b> the Rabbis maintain that the term “matter” serves <b>to exclude</b> a case in which <b>two</b> witnesses <b>say</b> that they saw <b>one</b> hair on a girl’s <b>back, and two</b> other witnesses <b>say</b> that they saw <b>one</b> hair <b>on her</b> lower <b>abdomen.</b> In this case the testimony of either set of witnesses concerns only one hair, and therefore <b>these</b> witnesses <b>are</b> essentially <b>saying</b> that <b>she is</b> still <b>a minor and those</b> witnesses <b>are saying</b> that <b>she is</b> still <b>a minor.</b> Therefore, each testimony concerns only half of a matter.
§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and sold</b> it <b>on Shabbat,</b> he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that in this case he is <b>exempt</b> from the fourfold or fivefold payment?
<b>Rami bar Ḥama said: When it is taught</b> in <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> this is referring to a case <b>where</b> the purchaser <b>says to</b> the thief: <b>Pick off a fig for yourself from my fig tree</b> on Shabbat, <b>and</b> through performing this act <b>your stolen</b> animal shall be <b>acquired by me.</b> Since the act of acquisition of the animal involved the type of Shabbat desecration for which one is liable to receive the death penalty, the thief is exempt from the monetary obligations he would ordinarily incur from this act, i.e., the fourfold or fivefold payment to the animal’s prior owner. This is in accordance with the principle that one who commits two or more transgressions by means of a single act, both of which entail punishment, is exempt from the lesser punishment.
The Sages <b>say,</b> questioning this explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But since, if</b> the purchaser <b>would bring a legal claim against</b> the thief <b>before us,</b> to force him to deliver the animal acquired by means of picking the fig, the court <b>would not say to</b> the thief: <b>Go</b> and <b>pay</b> him the animal you owe him, <b>because</b> the thief <b>is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty for his desecration of Shabbat, this shows that <b>the sale is not</b> a valid <b>sale</b> at all. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> would not call this exchange a sale and this interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> cannot be correct.
<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where</b> the purchaser <b>said to</b> the thief: <b>Throw your stolen</b> animal from the public domain <b>into my</b> enclosed <b>courtyard, and your stolen</b> animal <b>will</b> thereby <b>be acquired by me.</b> One can acquire an item if it is placed on his property. In this case, when the thief places the animal on the purchaser’s property he moves it from the public domain into the private domain, which is a desecration of Shabbat that entails the death penalty. Consequently, he is exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara asks: If this is the correct explanation of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion is the <i>baraita</i> taught? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says:</b> An item <b>in</b> the <b>airspace</b> of a certain area <b>is considered</b> as though it were <b>at rest</b> in that area.
<b>As, if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that an item in the airspace of a certain area is not considered as though it were at rest in that area, <b>once</b> the animal <b>reaches the</b> airspace <b>of the courtyard</b> of the purchaser’s <b>house</b> he has acquired it, as one can acquire items that are in the airspace of his courtyard just like those on its ground, whereas <b>with regard to</b> moving an item from one domain to another on <b>Shabbat</b> the thief <b>is not liable</b> for Shabbat desecration <b>until it reaches the ground.</b> Since the thief’s monetary liability is not simultaneous with his incurring of the death penalty, he would not be exempt from payment.
The Gemara answers: It is possible that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis as well, as one can explain that it is speaking of a case <b>in</b> which the purchaser <b>says</b> to the thief: <b>Your stolen</b> animal <b>shall not be acquired by me until it rests</b> on the ground. In that case, the acquisition of the animal and the Shabbat desecration are simultaneous.
<b>Rava said: Actually,</b> it is possible to explain the <b><i>baraita</i> as Rami bar Ḥama</b> did, that the animal was acquired through the picking of a fig on Shabbat. And the objection raised earlier, that this act should not be considered a sale at all, is incorrect. This can be demonstrated by the fact that the <b>Torah prohibits</b> one to bring as an offering an animal given as the <b>payment</b> to a prostitute for services rendered (Deuteronomy 23:19). <b>And</b> this prohibition applies <b>even</b> if the man in question <b>engaged in intercourse with his own mother,</b> which is a capital offense. <b>But if she</b> would bring <b>a legal claim before us, demanding</b> the payment of the animal that was agreed upon as her fee, <b>would we say to him: Arise and pay her</b> the animal? The court would not say this, as the monetary liability was incurred simultaneously with the commission of a capital crime.
<b>Rather,</b> one must say that <b>even though if she</b> brings <b>a legal claim</b> against <b>him demanding</b> the payment of the animal that was agreed upon as her fee <b>we do not say to him: Go and pay her,</b> nevertheless, <b>since if</b> he does <b>give</b> it <b>to her it is</b> considered <b>payment</b> to a prostitute, it cannot be used as an offering. <b>Here too,</b> in the case of the acquisition of the animal through picking a fig, <b>even though with regard to payment, if</b> the purchaser would bring <b>a legal claim before us</b> against the thief, <b>seeking</b> to force him to deliver the animal, <b>we would not say to him: Go pay,</b>

Daf 71a

and <b>even so, since</b> the thief <b>transfers ownership to</b> the purchaser <b>in this</b> manner, <b>it is</b> considered a valid <b>sale,</b> and he is required to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>on Yom Kippur</b> he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Sages <b>say,</b> questioning this ruling: <b>Why</b> is he liable to pay it? <b>Although there is no</b> penalty of <b>execution</b> for slaughtering on Yom Kippur, <b>nevertheless there is</b> the penalty of <b>lashes; and we maintain that</b> one <b>is not</b> sentenced to be <b>flogged and</b> obligated to <b>pay</b> for the same act.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna taught? <b>It is</b> taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says:</b> One is sentenced to be <b>flogged and</b> obligated to <b>pay</b> for the same action.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> then <b>even</b> if he <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>on Shabbat,</b> which is a capital offense, he should be obligated to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, whereas the mishna (74b) states that in this case he is exempt. <b>And if you would say</b> that Rabbi Meir <b>holds</b> that one is sentenced to be <b>flogged and</b> obligated to <b>pay</b> for the same act, but <b>he does not hold</b> that one is sentenced to the <b>death</b> penalty <b>and</b> obligated to <b>pay</b> for the same act, this is incorrect.
<b>And</b> is it correct to say that Rabbi Meir does <b>not</b> maintain that one can be sentenced to the death penalty and to pay for the same act? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>on Shabbat,</b> or if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>for idol worship,</b> or if <b>he stole an ox that is</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned,</b> from which it is prohibited to derive any benefit, <b>and he slaughtered it,</b> he <b>pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold</b> payment; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis exempt</b> him from this payment. Apparently Rabbi Meir maintains that one can be held liable for monetary payment and for capital punishment for the same act, e.g., slaughtering on Shabbat or slaughtering for idol worship.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: Stand <b>apart from this</b> <i>baraita</i>, i.e., this <i>baraita</i> should not be understood in a straightforward manner, <b>as it was stated concerning it: Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yirmeya</b> who <b>says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says,</b> and <b>Rabbi Avin and Rabbi Ela and the entire group</b> of disciples of Rabbi Yoḥanan also <b>say in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is speaking <b>of</b> a thief who <b>slaughters</b> the stolen animal <b>through</b> the agency of <b>another</b> person, i.e., he instructed another to slaughter it, and that agent did so on Shabbat or for idolatrous purposes. The thief pays the fourfold or fivefold payment because he himself did not commit a capital offense.
The Gemara asks: How can it be that a thief is liable to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment if another person slaughters the stolen animal for him? <b>But</b> is it <b>so</b> that <b>this</b> one <b>sins and that</b> one <b>becomes liable?</b>
The Gemara provides several reasons why in the case of fourfold or fivefold payment it is possible for the thief to be liable for another’s actions. <b>Rava said:</b> It <b>is different here, as the verse states: “And slaughter it or sell it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), thereby juxtaposing the two acts of slaughtering and selling. It is derived that <b>just as</b> there is liability for the fourfold or fivefold payment through <b>selling,</b> which by definition is performed <b>by means of another</b> party, <b>so too,</b> there is liability for <b>slaughtering</b> when it is performed <b>by means of another</b> party.
<b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael teaches:</b> The word <b>“or”</b> in the phrase: “And slaughter it or sell it,” serves <b>to include</b> a case in which <b>the agent</b> slaughters or sells the animal at the behest of the thief. <b>The school of Ḥizkiyya teaches:</b> The separate word <b>“for” [<i>taḥat</i>]</b> in the phrase: “He shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep,” which could have been avoided by using the mere prefix of the letter <i>beit</i>, serves <b>to include</b> a case in which <b>the agent</b> slaughters the animal on behalf of the thief.
<b>Mar Zutra objects to this</b> explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Is there anything</b> with regard to <b>which if</b> one <b>performs</b> it <b>himself</b> he is <b>not liable, and</b> if his <b>agent performs</b> it on his behalf one is <b>liable?</b> How is it possible for an agent to have more power than the one who appointed him? Can it be that if the thief himself slaughtered the animal on Shabbat he would be exempt, whereas if he has it slaughtered by another he is liable?
<b>Rav Ashi said to him: There,</b> in the case of the thief who slaughters a stolen animal on Shabbat, <b>it is not because he is not liable</b> that he does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment; <b>rather,</b> he is liable but he is excused from payment <b>because he receives the greater of</b> the two punishments, i.e., execution, for desecrating Shabbat. When he appoints an agent he has no liability for desecrating Shabbat, and therefore he pays for the slaughter.
The Gemara asks: <b>But if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is speaking <b>about</b> a thief who <b>slaughters through</b> the agency of <b>another</b> person, <b>what is the reason of the Rabbis, who exempt</b> the thief from payment? The thief did not himself do any act for which he is liable to receive the death penalty.
The Sages <b>say</b> in explanation: <b>Who</b> are these <b>Rabbis</b> of the <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>Rabbi Shimon, who said:</b> The legal status of an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> for accomplishing its full ritual purpose <b>is not considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter.</b> Since slaughtering on Shabbat or slaughtering for idolatrous purposes does not render the meat fit for consumption, Rabbi Shimon rules that there is no liability for the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Sages <b>say,</b> questioning this explanation: <b>Granted,</b> slaughtering for <b>idol worship and</b> slaughtering <b>an ox that is</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned are</b> cases of <b>slaughter that is not fit,</b> as in both of these cases it is prohibited to derive any benefit from the animal’s flesh. <b>But</b> slaughtering on <b>Shabbat is a fit slaughter. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 14a): In the case of <b>one who slaughters</b> an animal <b>on Shabbat or on Yom Kippur, although he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty for desecrating Shabbat, <b>his slaughter is valid</b> and the meat may be eaten.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: Rabbi Shimon <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar,</b> who disagrees with that mishna and prohibits eating the meat of an animal slaughtered on Shabbat.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 2:3): In the case of <b>one who cooks</b> food <b>on Shabbat,</b> if he acted <b>unwittingly he may eat</b> the food, but if he acted <b>intentionally he may not eat</b> it; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he acted <b>unwittingly he may eat</b> the food only <b>upon the conclusion of Shabbat,</b> and if he acted <b>intentionally he may not eat</b> it <b>ever,</b> although others may partake of it.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar says:</b> If he cooked the food <b>unwittingly</b> it <b>may be eaten upon the conclusion of Shabbat by others</b> only, <b>but not by him;</b> and if he acted <b>intentionally it may not be eaten ever, neither by him nor by others.</b> Slaughter, like cooking, is a desecration of Shabbat that entails the death penalty. It follows that Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar maintains that the meat of an animal intentionally slaughtered on Shabbat may never be eaten. If so, this is a slaughter that does not render the meat fit for consumption, and therefore according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon there is no fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason for</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan HaSandlar?</b> The Gemara explains: This is <b>as Rabbi Ḥiyya taught at the entrance to the house of the <i>Nasi</i>.</b> It is written: <b>“And you shall observe Shabbat, for it is holy [<i>kodesh</i>] to you;</b> one who profanes it shall be put to death” (Exodus 31:14). <b>Just as it is prohibited to eat a sacred</b> item consecrated to the Temple [<i>kodesh</i>], <b>so too is it prohibited to eat</b> food produced though <b>action</b> that desecrates <b>Shabbat.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> so, perhaps the analogy should be extended: <b>Just as it is prohibited to derive benefit</b> from <b>a sacred</b> item, <b>so too</b> should it be <b>prohibited to derive benefit</b> from a product of <b>an action</b> that desecrates <b>Shabbat.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “It is holy <b>to you”</b> (Exodus 31:14), indicating that <b>it shall be yours</b> for deriving benefit. Although food cooked on Shabbat may not be eaten, it is permitted to benefit from it in other ways.
The Gemara further asks: Based on the analogy between a sacred item and the product of an action that desecrates Shabbat, one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>even</b> if the action were performed <b>unwittingly</b> it should be prohibited to consume the product, like a sacred item. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “One who profanes it shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14), indicating that it is <b>with regard to</b> one who desecrates Shabbat <b>intentionally</b> that <b>I said</b> this analogy <b>to you,</b> as the verse clearly is referring to one who is liable to receive the death penalty, <b>but not</b> one who desecrates Shabbat <b>unwittingly,</b> who is not executed.
The Gemara comments: <b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree with regard to</b> this matter. <b>One said</b> that the product of <b>an action</b> that constitutes a desecration of <b>Shabbat</b> is forbidden <b>by Torah law, and one said</b> that the product of <b>an action</b> that constitutes a desecration of <b>Shabbat</b> is forbidden <b>by rabbinic</b> law.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>The one who says</b> it is forbidden <b>by Torah law</b> explains <b>as we said,</b> that the prohibition is based on the verse as interpreted by Rabbi Ḥiyya. <b>And the one who says</b> it is forbidden <b>by rabbinic law</b> would say that <b>the verse states: “It is holy,”</b> from which he infers: <b>It,</b> the day itself, <b>is holy but</b> the products of <b>its</b> prohibited <b>actions are not holy,</b> and therefore they are not compared to sacred items and may be eaten by Torah law.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that products of a prohibited act are prohibited <b>by Torah law, it is for</b>

Daf 71b

<b>this</b> reason that <b>the Rabbis exempt</b> the thief from the fourfold or fivefold payment when he slaughters the animal on Shabbat, as slaughter on Shabbat does not render the meat permitted for consumption. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the product of a prohibited act on Shabbat may be eaten by Torah law but is forbidden <b>by rabbinic law, why do the Rabbis exempt</b> the thief when he appoints an agent to slaughter the animal for him and the agent performs this action on Shabbat?
The Gemara answers: When the Rabbis exempt him from the fourfold or fivefold payment, they are not referring to the case where the thief’s agent slaughters the animal on Shabbat. Rather, they were speaking <b>of the rest</b> of the cases listed in the <i>baraita</i>, namely, an agent who slaughters the animal <b>for idol worship and</b> one who slaughters <b>an ox that is</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned.</b>
The Gemara asks another question with regard to the interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> presented above: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> granted he maintains that the legal status of an act of slaughter not fit for accomplishing its full ritual purpose is nevertheless considered an act of slaughter. But <b>why</b> is the thief <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment when his agent <b>slaughters</b> the animal <b>for idol worship?</b>
<b>Once he slaughtered</b> the animal <b>a bit,</b> at the very start of the act of slaughter, <b>he has prohibited</b> the animal, with regard to deriving benefit, as an animal sacrificed to idolatry. When he slaughters <b>the other</b> part <b>it is</b> already <b>prohibited</b> with regard to <b>deriving benefit,</b> which means that it is <b>not</b> an animal that belongs <b>to its owner</b> that he <b>slaughters, and</b> it is <b>not</b> an animal that belongs <b>to him</b> that he <b>slaughters.</b> Since deriving benefit from the animal is prohibited, it has no value; therefore, there is no ownership.
<b>Rava said:</b> This is referring <b>to one who says</b> prior to the slaughter that only <b>with the completion of the slaughter</b> does <b>he worship</b> the idolatry. Therefore, the prohibition does not take effect until that stage, which is also when the liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment is incurred.
The Gemara raises a question with regard to another of the cases of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>An ox that is</b> sentenced to be <b>stoned is an item from which</b> deriving <b>benefit is prohibited.</b> Consequently, when a thief or his agent slaughters this animal, it is <b>not</b> an animal that belongs <b>to its owner</b> that he <b>slaughters, and</b> it is <b>not</b> an animal that belongs <b>to him</b> that he <b>slaughters.</b> Why does Rabbi Meir obligate him to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment?
<b>Rava said: With what are we dealing here?</b> This is a case <b>where</b> the owners <b>entrusted</b> the ox <b>to a bailee and</b> the ox fatally <b>injured</b> someone while <b>in the bailee’s house, and it was forewarned</b> while <b>in the bailee’s house, and it was sentenced</b> to be stoned while <b>in the bailee’s house,</b> and the thief then stole it from the bailee’s house and slaughtered it. Rava continues: <b>And Rabbi Meir holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, and he</b> also <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
<b>He holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, who says: Even after</b> the ox <b>was sentenced</b> to be stoned, if the <b>bailee returned it to its owners</b> before it was killed, <b>it is</b> considered <b>returned.</b> Although the ox is now worthless, as no benefit may be derived from it, since the bailee returned a physically intact ox, the owner has no claim against him.
<b>And</b> Rabbi Meir also <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says: An item whose</b> elimination <b>causes financial</b> loss <b>is considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value. With regard to an item that is otherwise worthless, if its elimination causes monetary loss due to the fact that it must be replaced, it is considered to be of value. In this case, although the ox is worthless in and of itself, when the thief slaughters it he prevents the bailee from returning it intact to the owner and causes him to be obligated to pay the owner the value of the ox before it was sentenced to be stoned. Consequently, the thief must reimburse the bailee, as the ox effectively has value for that bailee.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (74b): <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In the case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>for which</b> the owner <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> to replace any of them with another animal if it is lost or it dies, the thief is <b>obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment if he slaughters the animal. Although one is generally not liable to pay the double payment for stealing consecrated items, Rabbi Shimon maintains that this case is different, since as a result of the animal’s theft the owner sustains a loss by being required to substitute another animal for it. Since the animal’s loss has financial ramifications for the owner apart from any inherent value it has, it has value for him. <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Shimon holds that <b>an item whose</b> elimination <b>causes financial</b> loss <b>is considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value.
<b>Rav Kahana said: I recited</b> this <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> according to which the mishna follows the opinion of Rabbi Meir, <b>in front of Rav Zevid of Neharde’a,</b> and I asked him: Is it correct to say that <b>you can establish the mishna in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon? But isn’t it taught</b> in <b>the last clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Shimon exempts</b> the thief from the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>in these</b> last <b>two</b> cases. One can learn <b>by inference that in all the</b> rest of the cases in the <b>mishna,</b> apart from these two, Rabbi Shimon <b>concedes</b> that the thief pays the fourfold or fivefold payment.
Rav Zevid <b>said to him: No;</b> that is not the correct inference from the mishna. Rather, <b>by inference</b> one can learn only <b>that</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>concedes</b> that the thief pays the fourfold or fivefold payment in the cases mentioned immediately prior to this one, specifically <b>in</b> a case where the thief <b>slaughtered or sold</b> the animal in order that it should be used <b>for medicinal purposes or for</b> feeding to <b>dogs.</b> Therefore, it can be correct to establish the mishna in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir and not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>of his father’s and</b> then <b>slaughtered or sold</b> it, and afterward his father died, he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment to his father’s other heirs. <b>Rava raised a dilemma before Rav Naḥman:</b> If one <b>stole an ox</b> belonging <b>to two partners and slaughtered it, and</b> subsequently <b>admitted</b> the theft <b>to one of</b> the partners, which means that he is exempt from paying the fourfold or fivefold payment to that partner, in accordance with the principle that one who admits his own guilt is exempt from fines, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to payment to the other partner?
The Gemara explains the sides of the dilemma: <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “He shall pay <b>five oxen</b> for an ox” (Exodus 21:37), which indicates five full oxen, <b>but not five half-oxen. Or perhaps</b> when <b>the Merciful One states “five oxen,”</b> this means that <b>even five half-oxen</b> must be paid in a case of this kind. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>The Merciful One states: “Five oxen,”</b> which means five full oxen, <b>but not five half-oxen.</b>
Rava <b>raised an objection to him</b> from the mishna: If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>of his father’s and</b> then <b>slaughtered or sold</b> it, <b>and afterward his father died, he pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. But here, since his father died</b> and the thief has inherited part of the stolen animal himself, it is <b>similar to</b> the case of one who stole from two partners <b>and went ahead and admitted</b> the theft <b>to one of them,</b> i.e., to himself. In the case of the mishna he is exempt from paying the portion of the fine that is for himself, <b>and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches</b> that <b>he pays</b> the other heirs their portion of <b>the fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>With what are we dealing here? With</b> a case <b>where his father stood</b> against his son the thief <b>in</b> his <b>trial,</b> and the son was convicted for the theft and slaughter of his father’s animal. In this case, the liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment was established before the father’s death, and at that time the payment was five full oxen.
Rava asked him: <b>And</b> if the thief had <b>not</b> yet <b>stood trial</b> before the father’s death, <b>what</b> would be the <i>halakha</i>, according to your opinion? Would he <b>not</b> be required to <b>pay the fourfold or fivefold payment? If so, rather than teaching in the latter clause</b> of the mishna (74b): If one <b>stole his father’s</b> animal <b>and</b> the father <b>died, and afterward he slaughtered or sold</b> it, <b>he does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment; let</b> the mishna <b>make a distinction within the same</b> type of case, as follows: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> i.e., that the thief is required to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>said?</b> It is <b>when</b> the thief <b>stood trial</b> in his father’s lifetime; <b>but</b> if he <b>did not stand trial</b> in his father’s lifetime <b>he does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Indeed,</b> the mishna could have mentioned that case. However, <b>since</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna has to <b>cite the first clause,</b> which discusses one who <b>stole</b> an animal <b>of his father’s and slaughtered or sold</b> it, <b>and afterward his father died, he cites the latter clause as well,</b> by means of a similar case: If one <b>stole his father’s</b> animal <b>and his father died, and afterward he slaughtered or sold</b> the animal.
This discussion between Rava and Rav Naḥman occurred in the evening. <b>On the</b> following <b>morning,</b> Rav Naḥman retracted his statement and <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>The Merciful One states: “Five oxen,” and</b> this means that <b>even five half-oxen</b> are included. Rav Naḥman explained his change of mind: <b>And</b> the reason <b>that I did not say</b> this <b>to you</b> last <b>night</b>

Daf 72a

is <b>because I had not eaten ox meat.</b> In other words, I was fasting yesterday and was unable to concentrate properly.
Rava responded to him: <b>But</b> if the Torah requires even a partial payment of the fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>what is different</b> in <b>the first clause,</b> in which the son must pay, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> where he is exempt?
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> In <b>the first clause,</b> where the father’s animal was stolen and slaughtered in his lifetime, <b>I read about</b> this case the verse: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, <b>and slaughter it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), which indicates that the thief slaughtered the ox or the sheep <b>entirely in a prohibited</b> manner. In <b>the latter clause,</b> where the animal was slaughtered after the father’s death, <b>I do not read about</b> this case the verse: <b>“And slaughter it,”</b> which describes a slaughter that was performed <b>entirely in a prohibited</b> manner, because the animal already partially belonged to him, and his own portion of the ox was slaughtered in a permitted manner.
§ The mishna teaches: A thief <b>who slaughters</b> the animal <b>but it was found to be a <i>tereifa</i>,</b> and likewise a thief who slaughters a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard, pays the fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>Rav Ḥavivi of Meḥoza said to Rav Ashi: Conclude from</b> the mishna that the act <b>of slaughtering</b> is considered to have been performed <b>only at the end</b> of the slaughtering process.
Rav Ḥavivi of Meḥoza explains: <b>As, if</b> you say that the act <b>of slaughtering</b> lasts <b>from beginning to end,</b> i.e., the halakhic ramifications of slaughtering are in effect throughout the process, one could raise a question with regard to the case of one who slaughters a non-sacred animal in the Temple courtyard: <b>Once he slaughtered</b> the animal <b>a bit,</b> at the very start of the act of slaughter, <b>he has prohibited</b> the animal, with regard to deriving benefit, as a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard. When he slaughters <b>the other</b> part, it is already prohibited with regard to deriving benefit, which means that it is <b>not</b> an animal that belongs <b>to its owner</b> that he <b>slaughters.</b> Since deriving benefit from the animal is prohibited, it has no value; therefore, there is no ownership.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rava, said to</b> Rav Ḥavivi in response: It is possible to explain the mishna even if one maintains that the halakhic ramifications of slaughtering are in effect throughout the slaughter. As, <b>when does</b> the thief <b>become obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment? It is <b>when</b> he performs <b>that</b> first <b>bit</b> of slaughter in the beginning, before the animal becomes forbidden. <b>Rav Ashi said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>Do not dismiss</b> Rav Ḥavivi’s objection with this explanation. The verse: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, <b>and slaughter it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), indicates that to impose liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>we require</b> that the thief slaughtered it <b>completely, and</b> after having slaughtered it just a bit <b>there is no</b> complete slaughter yet.
Rav Huna said to Rav Ashi: <b>But</b> if you are correct, the mishna <b>is difficult</b> according to the one who maintains that the halakhic ramifications of slaughtering are in effect throughout the slaughter. Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>This is what Rav Gamda said in the name of Rava,</b> concerning this question: The mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the thief <b>slaughtered,</b> i.e., severed, <b>part</b> of the <b>two organs that must be severed in ritual slaughter,</b> i.e., the trachea and the esophagus <b>[<i>simanin</i>], outside</b> the Temple, and <b>finished</b> slaughtering <b>them inside</b> the Temple. Therefore, the animal became prohibited with regard to deriving benefit only at the final stage of slaughter, concomitant with the liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who teach</b> that the preceding exchange took place <b>with regard to</b> the following dispute: <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> ben Lakish <b>says in the name of Rabbi Levi the Elder:</b> The act of slaughtering is considered to have been <b>performed only at the end</b> of the slaughtering process. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The act <b>of slaughtering lasts from beginning to end. Rav Ḥavivi of Meḥoza said to Rav Ashi: Shall we say that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds</b> that the prohibition against deriving benefit from <b>non-sacred</b> animals <b>that were slaughtered in the Temple courtyard is not by Torah law?</b>

Daf 72b

<b>As, if it enters your mind</b> that it is prohibited <b>by Torah law</b> the mishna here would be difficult, for <b>as soon as he slaughtered</b> the animal <b>a bit,</b> at the very start of the act of slaughter, <b>he has prohibited</b> the animal, with regard to deriving benefit, as a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard. When he slaughters <b>the other</b> part it is already prohibited with regard to deriving benefit, which means that it is <b>not</b> an animal that belongs <b>to its owner</b> that he <b>slaughters.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to</b> Rav Ḥavivi: It is possible to explain the mishna even according to the opinion that the halakhic ramifications of slaughtering are in effect throughout the slaughter, and even if one maintains that it is prohibited by Torah law to benefit from a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple. As, <b>when does</b> the thief <b>become obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>as well?</b> It is <b>when</b> he performs <b>that</b> first <b>bit</b> of slaughter in the beginning, before the animal becomes forbidden. <b>Rav Ashi said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>Do not dismiss</b> Rav Ḥavivi’s suggestion with this explanation. The verse: “If a man steal an ox or a sheep, <b>and slaughter it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), indicates that in order to impose liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>we require</b> that the thief slaughtered it <b>completely, and</b> after having slaughtered it just a bit <b>there is no</b> complete slaughter yet.
Rav Huna said to Rav Ashi: <b>But</b> if you are correct, the mishna <b>is difficult.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>This is what Rav Gamda said in the name of Rava: When</b> does the mishna state that the thief <b>is obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment? It is in a case <b>where</b> the thief <b>slaughtered part</b> of the <b><i>simanim</i> outside</b> the Temple, <b>and finished</b> slaughtering <b>them inside</b> the Temple. Therefore, the animal became prohibited with regard to deriving benefit only at the final stage of slaughter, concomitant with the liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>stole</b> an ox or a sheep, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>or sold</b> it, also <b>based on</b> the testimony of the same witnesses, <b>and</b> these witnesses <b>were found</b> to be <b>conspiring</b> witnesses, these witnesses <b>pay everything,</b> i.e., not only the principal amount but also the fourfold or fivefold payment. This is in accordance with the Torah’s decree with regard to conspiring witnesses: “You shall do to him as he had conspired to do to his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19). Since these witnesses attempted to obligate the alleged thief to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, they themselves must pay that full amount.
With regard to one who <b>stole</b> an ox or a sheep, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>or sold</b> it, <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two other</b> witnesses, if both <b>these</b> witnesses <b>and those</b> witnesses <b>were found</b> to be <b>conspiring</b> witnesses, <b>the first</b> set of witnesses, who testified about the theft of the animal, <b>pay</b> the alleged thief the <b>double payment,</b> which is what they had conspired to cause him to pay. <b>And the last</b> set of witnesses, who attested to the slaughter or sale of the animal, <b>pay</b> the alleged thief a twofold payment for a sheep or <b>a threefold payment</b> for an ox, which they had conspired to cause him to pay over and above the double payment.
If only the witnesses in the <b>last</b> set <b>were found</b> to be <b>conspiring</b> witnesses, while the testimony about the theft remains intact, the thief <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment</b> to the animal’s owner <b>and</b> the second set of witnesses <b>pay</b> the alleged thief the twofold or <b>threefold payment,</b> the amount over and above the double payment, which is what they had conspired to cause him to pay.
If only <b>one</b> individual <b>from the last</b> set of witnesses was found to be <b>a conspiring</b> witness, <b>the second testimony</b> is <b>nullified,</b> as it was not submitted by two valid witnesses, whereas the first testimony remains intact. If <b>one</b> individual <b>from the first</b> set of witnesses is found to be <b>a conspiring</b> witness, <b>the entire testimony</b> concerning the thief is <b>nullified.</b> The reason is <b>that if there is no theft</b> established by reliable testimony <b>there is no</b> liability for <b>slaughtering</b> the animal <b>and there is no</b> liability for <b>selling</b> it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> One who is rendered a conspiring witness is barred from providing testimony in the future. The Gemara cites a fundamental dispute with regard to this disqualification. <b>It was stated</b> concerning <b>a conspiring witness: Abaye says: He is disqualified retroactively,</b> from when he provided his testimony. Any testimony he may have provided after that point in time is retroactively nullified. <b>Rava says: He is disqualified</b> only <b>from that point forward,</b> i.e., from when he was established to be a conspiring witness, but not retroactively from when he provided his testimony.
The Gemara explains the reasons for the two opinions: <b>Abaye says he is disqualified retroactively</b> because it is <b>from that time when he testified</b> that <b>he is</b> considered <b>a wicked man, and the Torah said: “Do not put</b> your hand with <b>the wicked</b> to be an unrighteous <b>witness”</b> (Exodus 23:1), which is interpreted to mean: Do not allow a wicked man to serve as a witness.
<b>Rava says</b> that <b>he is disqualified</b> only <b>from that point forward</b> because the disqualification of <b>a conspiring witness is a novelty,</b> i.e., it is not based on logic. The reason is <b>that this</b> is a case of <b>two</b> witnesses <b>against two</b> other witnesses, in which case neither testimony should be accepted. <b>What did you see that</b> causes <b>you</b> to <b>listen to</b> the second set of witnesses, who testify that the first set were not at the scene of the purported event? You could instead <b>listen to</b> the first set of witnesses, who testify to the event, and disbelieve the second set. Yet the Torah teaches that the second set of witnesses is always deemed credible and the first set is subjected to punishment as conspiring witnesses.
<b>Therefore,</b> as the disqualification of the conspiring witnesses is an anomaly, <b>you have</b> the right to disqualify them <b>only from the time of the novelty and onward,</b> i.e., this counterintuitive disqualification is not applied retroactively.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rava also holds like Abaye, who says</b> that by rights a conspiring witness <b>should be disqualified retroactively</b> from when he provided his testimony, <b>and here this is Rava’s reason</b> for not disqualifying him retroactively:

Daf 73a

It is <b>due to</b> the potential monetary <b>loss for purchasers,</b> whose acquisitions had been validated by these witnesses between the time of the witnesses’ first testimony and when they were rendered conspiring witnesses. If the disqualification of the witnesses were applied retroactively, as by right it should, all these transactions would be nullified, which would cause a loss to these purchasers.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two explanations of Rava’s opinion? After all, according to both explanations Rava did not apply the disqualification of conspiring witnesses retroactively. The Gemara explains that there is a difference in a case <b>where two</b> witnesses <b>testify about one</b> of the witnesses that he was not at the scene of the supposed crime, <b>and two</b> other witnesses testify <b>about</b> the other <b>one</b> witness in a similar manner. <b>Alternatively,</b> there is a practical difference between the two explanations in a case where two witnesses <b>disqualified</b> the first set of witnesses <b>by</b> testifying that they had once committed <b>robbery</b> and are therefore unfit to give testimony.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>According to this version</b> in <b>which you say</b> that Rava’s rejection of retroactive disqualification was <b>because</b> it is <b>a novelty,</b> in these two circumstances <b>there is no</b> novelty, and therefore he would agree that the disqualification should be retroactive. <b>According to that version</b> in <b>which you say</b> that Rava’s concern was <b>due to</b> a potential <b>loss for purchasers,</b> in these two circumstances <b>there is</b> a concern for a potential loss for purchasers. Consequently, in these circumstances as well Rava would reject retroactive disqualification.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya of Difti related: Rav Pappa</b> once <b>took action,</b> i.e., ruled in a case, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava,</b> and rejected retroactive disqualification of conspiring witnesses. <b>Rav Ashi said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Abaye</b> with regard to retroactive disqualification of conspiring witnesses. The Gemara provides a principle: <b>And</b> in disputes between Abaye and Rava the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rava, except for six cases in which <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Abaye.</b> They are: <b>In</b> the cases represented by the mnemonic <b><i>yod-ayin-lamed kuf-gimmel-mem</i>.</b> These <i>halakhot</i> are the following: Unknown despair [<i>ye’ush</i>]; conspiring witness [<i>eidim</i>] who are disqualified retroactively; a side post [<i>leḥi</i>] standing alone; betrothal [<i>kiddushin</i>] that is not given to consummation; revealing intent with a bill of divorce [<i>get</i>]; and an apostate [<i>mumar</i>] who sins rebelliously.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Abaye’s opinion from that which <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: If one <b>stole</b> an ox or a sheep, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses, <b>and</b> he <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>or sold</b> it, also <b>based on</b> the testimony of the same witnesses, <b>and</b> these witnesses <b>were found</b> to be <b>conspiring witnesses,</b> these conspiring witnesses <b>pay everything,</b> including the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara explains the question: <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case in <b>which</b> the events occurred in the following sequence: The witnesses <b>testified concerning the theft</b> of the animal, <b>and then testified concerning the</b> animal’s <b>slaughter. And</b> subsequently <b>they were rendered conspiring witnesses</b> for their testimony <b>concerning the theft, and then they were rendered conspiring witnesses</b> for their testimony <b>concerning the slaughter.</b>
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say, in accordance with the opinion of Abaye, that a conspiring witness <b>is disqualified retroactively</b> from the time he provided his testimony, then with regard to <b>these</b> witnesses, <b>once they are rendered conspiring witnesses concerning the theft, the matter becomes clarified retroactively that when they testified concerning the slaughter they were disqualified</b> to serve as witnesses. Consequently, that testimony should be rejected. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>must they pay</b> the fourfold or fivefold payment for their testimony <b>concerning</b> the animal’s <b>slaughter?</b>
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the events did not happen in this sequence. Rather, the witnesses were <b>first rendered conspiring witnesses</b> with regard to their testimony <b>concerning</b> the animal’s <b>slaughter,</b> and only afterward were they rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the theft.
The Sages <b>say,</b> in rejection of this answer: <b>Ultimately, when</b> they <b>are subsequently rendered conspiring witnesses</b> with regard to their testimony <b>concerning the theft, the matter becomes clarified retroactively that when they testified concerning the slaughter they were disqualified</b> from providing testimony. <b>Why,</b> then, <b>must they pay</b> the fourfold or fivefold payment for their testimony <b>concerning the</b> animal’s <b>slaughter?</b>
The Gemara gives its final answer: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Abaye, since the mishna can be explained as discussing a case <b>where</b> the witnesses <b>testified</b> concerning the theft of the animal and its slaughter <b>at the same time, and</b> afterward <b>they were rendered conspiring witnesses</b> with regard to testimony about both matters. Therefore, even if the disqualification of these witnesses is established retroactively, they were not disqualified when they provided their single testimony concerning the theft and the slaughter.
The Gemara proposes: <b>Let us say</b> that the dispute between Abaye and Rava is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> As it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>there were two</b> witnesses <b>testifying against</b> someone, claiming <b>that</b> he <b>stole</b> an animal, <b>and they</b> subsequently <b>testify against him that</b> he <b>slaughtered</b> the animal, <b>and they were rendered conspiring witnesses</b> only with regard to their testimony <b>concerning the theft,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the principle that <b>testimony that was partially invalidated is entirely invalidated.</b> In other words, the testimony concerning the slaughter of the animal is null and void, as there is no longer any testimony that the animal was ever stolen. Therefore, the witnesses pay the double payment for having attempted to cause the alleged thief to pay that amount, while the accused is entirely exempt.
But <b>if they were rendered conspiring witnesses</b> only with regard to their testimony <b>concerning the slaughter,</b> their testimony about the theft remains valid. Consequently, the thief <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment, and</b> the witnesses <b>pay</b> a twofold or <b>threefold payment</b> for having attempted to cause the thief to pay this amount, which is the fine for slaughter or sale beyond his double payment.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yosei said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said when the theft and the slaughter were established <b>by two</b> separate <b>testimonies. But</b> if these matters were established <b>by one</b> single <b>testimony,</b> then even if they were rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the testimony concerning the slaughter, the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the principle that <b>testimony that was partially invalidated is entirely invalidated.</b> When the testimony concerning the slaughter is invalidated the testimony concerning the theft is likewise negated, and the alleged thief is not required to pay the double payment. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara analyzes Rabbi Yosei’s statement. <b>What</b> did Rabbi Yosei mean when he said: <b>By two</b> separate <b>testimonies, and what</b> did he mean when he said: <b>By one</b> single <b>testimony? If we say</b> that the phrase: <b>By two</b> separate <b>testimonies,</b> means <b>literally by two</b> separate testimonies, i.e., <b>by two</b> separate <b>sets</b> of witnesses, one of which testifies concerning the theft while the other testifies concerning the slaughter, this would mean that the expression: <b>By one</b> single <b>testimony,</b> means <b>by one set</b> of witnesses that testifies to both the theft and the slaughter, <b>one</b> matter <b>after the other.</b>
<b>And</b> if so, when <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> then <b>says</b> that the facts are established <b>by one testimony,</b> he meant <b>one set</b> of witnesses testifying about both matters, <b>one</b> matter <b>after the other,</b> i.e., <b>that they testify concerning the theft and then testify concerning the slaughter.</b> Therefore, <b>when they are rendered conspiring witnesses</b> only <b>with regard to the slaughter,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is determined in accordance with the principle that <b>testimony that was partially invalidated is entirely invalidated. And</b> consequently Rabbi Yosei would maintain that <b>they are</b> considered to have been <b>rendered conspiring witnesses concerning the theft</b> as well. The Gemara asks: <b>From where would this be derived?</b> Why should the earlier testimony about the theft be negated by their status as conspiring witnesses from the later testimony concerning the slaughter?
<b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not</b> the case that when Rabbi Yosei said: <b>By two testimonies,</b> he meant: <b>By a single testimony</b> that is <b>similar to two testimonies. And what is that?</b> It is <b>one set</b> of witnesses who testify about both the theft and the slaughter, <b>one</b> matter <b>after the other,</b> at two separate times. <b>But</b> if these matters were established <b>by one</b> single <b>testimony,</b> when the witnesses testified about both matters <b>at the same time,</b> Rabbi Yosei concedes that these are <b>not</b> considered two separate testimonies, despite the fact that they refer to two different events.
The Gemara continues to analyze the dispute between Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis: The <i>amora’im</i> discussing this matter <b>assumed that</b> according to <b>everyone,</b> i.e., both Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis, if a witness pauses briefly in his testimony and then continues to testify, it is considered one long testimony. This is in accordance with the principle that the legal status of a pause or retraction <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase <b>is like</b> that of continuous <b>speech.</b> Therefore, the two testimonies, the one concerning the theft and the one concerning the slaughter, are considered a single testimony.
The Gemara asks with regard to the above: <b>What, is it not with regard to this</b> that Rabbi Yosei and the Rabbis <b>disagree? As the Rabbis maintain,</b> like Rava, <b>that</b> a conspiring witness <b>is disqualified from here on,</b> i.e., from when he is rendered a conspiring witness. <b>And since</b> it was only <b>from that time,</b> when the other witnesses testify about them, <b>that</b> they <b>are rendered conspiring witnesses,</b> it is only with regard to their testimony <b>concerning</b> the animal’s <b>slaughter that they are rendered conspiring witnesses,</b> whereas <b>concerning the theft</b> itself <b>they are not rendered conspiring witnesses.</b>
And <b>Rabbi Yosei holds,</b> like Abaye, <b>that</b> a conspiring witness <b>is disqualified retroactively,</b> from when he provided his testimony. <b>And</b> consequently, <b>since they are disqualified immediately when they testify, if they are rendered conspiring witnesses concerning the slaughter they are rendered conspiring witnesses concerning the theft as well, as</b> the legal status of a pause or retraction <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase <b>is like</b> that of continuous <b>speech,</b> i.e., the two testimonies are considered one unit.
The Sages <b>say,</b> in rejection of this opinion: <b>If</b> it were accepted that the legal status of a pause or retraction <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase <b>is like</b> that of continuous <b>speech, everyone</b> would agree that the witnesses are <b>disqualified retroactively,</b> and their testimony with regard to the theft would also be negated. <b>But here they disagree</b> about that very issue, i.e., whether the legal status of a pause or retraction <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase <b>is like</b> that of continuous <b>speech. The Rabbis maintain that</b> if the pause is <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase, then the two aspects of the testimony provided by the witnesses

Daf 73b

<b>are not like</b> one testimony of continuous <b>speech,</b> but are considered separate testimonies, and therefore the testimony concerning the theft remains valid. <b>And Rabbi Yosei maintains that</b> the legal status of a pause <b>within</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase <b>is like</b> that of continuous <b>speech,</b> and therefore the testimony about the theft is disqualified together with the testimony concerning the slaughter.
The Gemara asks: <b>But does Rabbi Yosei</b> really <b>maintain</b> that the legal status of a statement interrupted or retracted <b>within</b> the time <b>required for speaking</b> a short phrase <b>is like</b> that of continuous <b>speech? But didn’t we learn</b> otherwise in a mishna (<i>Temura</i> 25b): If one designates an animal by saying: <b>This</b> animal <b>is hereby a substitute for a burnt-offering, a substitute for a peace-offering,</b> he has issued two contradictory statements and therefore <b>this</b> animal <b>is</b> considered <b>a substitute for a burnt-offering,</b> i.e., only the first part of his statement is accepted. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: If he intended this</b> outcome <b>from the outset,</b> that the animal should serve both as the substitute of a burnt-offering and as the substitute of a peace-offering, <b>since it is impossible</b> for one <b>to call it</b> by <b>two names at once,</b> i.e., the only way he can make his intent known is by issuing these two apparently contradictory declarations consecutively, <b>his statement stands,</b> and the animal has the status of both a substitute for a burnt-offering and a substitute for a peace-offering. <b>But if he said:</b> This animal is <b>a substitute for a burnt</b>-<b>offering and</b> then <b>changed his mind and said: A substitute for a peace-offering, it is a substitute for a burnt-offering.</b>
<b>And we discussed</b> this ruling: If he <b>changed his mind</b> before saying: A substitute for a peace-offering, it is <b>obvious</b> that he cannot remove the status he already applied to the animal, and the animal certainly remains a substitute for a burnt-offering. Rabbi Yosei would not have issued such an obvious ruling.
<b>And Rav Pappa said</b> in response to this question: <b>We are speaking</b> of a case where the individual <b>changed his mind within the time required for speaking</b> a short phrase. Rabbi Yosei holds that when one adds to a statement after a pause, even if the addition was made within a short time, it is considered a separate statement, which does not reverse the initial declaration. This contradicts the explanation given for the <i>baraita</i> cited above, according to which Rabbi Yosei maintains that when one adds to an existing statement within the time required for speaking a short phrase it is considered continuous speech.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>There are two</b> time frames that are referred to as being <b>within the time required for speaking</b> a short phrase. <b>One is the time required for a student to greet a rabbi, and</b> the other <b>one is the time required for the rabbi to greet a student. When does Rabbi Yosei hold</b> that a statement added within the time required for speaking a short phrase is <b>not</b> considered continuous speech? When the words are added <b>within the time required for a student to greet his rabbi</b> using the phrase: <b>Peace be upon you, my rabbi and teacher, as</b> that <b>is a long</b> pause. By contrast, if the statement is added <b>within the</b> shorter <b>time</b> frame <b>required for the rabbi to greet his student: Peace be upon you,</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>is of</b> the opinion <b>that</b> the added words constitute speech that is continuous with the original statement.
§ <b>Rava says: Witnesses</b> to a capital crime <b>who were</b> first <b>contradicted</b> by two other witnesses, and <b>ultimately they,</b> the first set of witnesses, <b>were rendered conspiring witnesses, are killed,</b>in accordance with the punishment for conspiring witnesses involved in a capital case, despite the fact that their testimony was already disqualified prior to the discovery of their conspiracy. The reason is that the <b>contradiction</b> of testimony <b>is the start of determining that</b> testimony is <b>conspiring</b> testimony, <b>only</b> the process <b>has not</b> yet <b>been completed</b> at the time of the contradiction.
<b>Rava said: From where do I say</b> that this is so? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Makkot</i> 1:3) that if witnesses say: <b>We testify with regard to so-and-so that he blinded his</b> Canaanite <b>slave’s eye and</b> afterward <b>knocked out his tooth,</b> and therefore the master is obligated to pay him compensation for the value of his tooth, <b>as that is what the master says,</b> i.e., this testimony is advantageous to the master, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>they were found</b> to be <b>conspiring witnesses, they pay</b> the <b>value of an eye to the slave.</b>
Rava explains that the <i>baraita</i> as written is problematic: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If we say that</b> it is exactly <b>as it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, i.e., <b>that there is no other set</b> of witnesses other than those whose statement is quoted in the <i>baraita</i> and the opposing set of witnesses who establish them as conspiring witnesses, several problems arise: First, why should they <b>pay</b> the <b>value of an eye to the slave? After emancipating him</b> by testifying that his master has blinded him, should <b>they be required to pay</b> him the <b>value of his eye?</b>
<b>And furthermore, they should be required to pay</b> the <b>value of the entire slave to the master,</b> as they intended to cause him to lose ownership of his slave through their false testimony. <b>And furthermore,</b> why does the <i>baraita</i> say: <b>As that is what the master says,</b> i.e., this testimony is advantageous to the master. <b>Is it</b> really <b>satisfactory to the master</b> that his slave be emancipated as a result of this testimony?
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that this case involves another, competing, testimony that is not mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Is it not</b> correct to say that the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with a case <b>where</b> prior to the testimonies mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> <b>two</b> other witnesses <b>came and said:</b> The master first <b>knocked out</b> the slave’s <b>tooth</b> and then <b>blinded his eye, in</b> which case <b>the master is required</b> to emancipate the slave and also <b>to give him</b> the <b>value of his eye; and</b> then <b>an intermediate</b> set of <b>two</b> witnesses <b>came and said</b> the testimony quoted in the <i>baraita</i>, that first the master blinded the slave’s <b>eye and then</b> knocked out <b>his tooth?</b> According to this account the master would still be required to emancipate the slave, but <b>he would be required to give him only</b> the <b>value of his tooth,</b> which is much less than the value of an eye. <b>In</b> this case the testimony of <b>the first</b> set of witnesses <b>contradicts</b> the testimony of <b>the intermediate ones.</b>
<b>And this is</b> the meaning of the clause: <b>As that is what the master says,</b> i.e., this testimony is advantageous to the master. It means <b>that what</b> the intermediate witnesses <b>say,</b> i.e., that he owes the value of a tooth, <b>is satisfactory to him,</b> as according to the claim of the first set, he owes the value of an eye. Since there are now contradictory testimonies, the testimony stating the claim of a loss of lesser value is accepted, and in that case the master would have to pay the slave only for the value of his tooth, in addition to emancipating him. This judgment corresponds exactly to the testimony of the intermediate set of witnesses.
<b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> subsequently <b>teaches: And</b> then <b>the intermediate</b> set of witnesses <b>were found to be conspiring witnesses,</b> as a third set of witnesses testified that the intermediate set was not at the scene of the incident at all. Therefore, the intermediate set of witnesses <b>pays</b> the <b>value of an eye to the slave</b> less the value of a tooth, as this is the amount of monetary damage the slave stood to incur as a result of their testimony.
Rava concludes his proof: <b>Learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that the <b>contradiction</b> of testimony <b>is the start of determining that</b> testimony is <b>conspiring</b> testimony. Although the testimony of the intermediate set of witnesses had already been contradicted before it was shown to be conspiring testimony, nevertheless, they can still be established as conspiring witness at that later stage, which means that they must pay an amount equivalent to the loss they were attempting to cause through their testimony.
<b>Abaye said: No.</b> There is another possible interpretation for the <i>baraita</i>, which answers the questions raised above and yet does not serve as proof for Rava’s opinion. According to this interpretation, the contradictory testimony was given after, not before, the testimony mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>.
It is possible that the <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where</b> a second set of witnesses both <b>reversed</b> the order of events, by testifying that the tooth was knocked out before the blinding of the eye, <b>and</b> at the same time <b>rendered</b> the first set witnesses <b>as conspiring witnesses,</b> by testifying that those original witnesses were not at the scene of the supposed events they claimed to have witnessed. It can be argued, albeit in a far-fetched manner, that the testimony of the first set of witnesses is considered to be to the master’s advantage even at this stage, because he knows what really happened, as reflected in the testimony of the later witnesses. Accordingly, Rava maintains that there are a total of three sets of witnesses in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, while Abaye says that there are only two sets.
Abaye elaborates: <b>From where</b> do I say that my interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> is correct?

Daf 74a

<b>From</b> the fact that <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> states a ruling <b>with regard to</b> a case in which the second set of witnesses both <b>reverses</b> the order of events <b>and renders</b> the first pair <b>as conspiring witnesses,</b> it may be inferred that <b>the first case as well,</b> in parallel fashion, states a ruling <b>with regard to</b> a case in which the second set of witnesses both <b>reverses</b> the order of events <b>and renders</b> the first pair <b>as conspiring witnesses.</b>
This is <b>as it teaches</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, that if witnesses say: <b>We testify</b> with regard to <b>so-and-so that he knocked out his</b> Canaanite <b>slave’s tooth and</b> afterward <b>blinded his eye,</b> which requires the master to emancipate him and compensate him for the value of his eye, <b>as that is what the slave says,</b> i.e., this testimony is advantageous to the slave, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>they were found</b> to be <b>conspiring witnesses, they pay the value of an eye to the master.</b>
Abaye analyzes this clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>If</b> it is speaking of a situation <b>where the latter</b> set of witnesses, who attested that the first set of witnesses were conspiring witnesses, <b>do not concede that</b> there was any <b>injury at all</b> inflicted on the slave by his master, then there is no testimony to confirm that those injuries were inflicted other than that given by the witnesses who were shown to be conspiring witnesses. Consequently, <b>they should be required to pay the entire value of the slave to the master,</b> as this is the amount of monetary damage the master stood to incur as a result of their false testimony.
<b>Rather, it is obvious that all of them,</b> i.e., both the first set of witnesses and the latter set, <b>concede with regard to the injury</b> inflicted on the slave by the master. They both agree that the master both blinded the slave’s eye and knocked out his tooth and therefore is obligated to emancipate him. They disagree concerning only the order of events. The first set of witnesses said that the tooth injury occurred first and the eye injury occurred afterward. Consequently, they sought to require the master to emancipate the slave and compensate him for the eye injury.
<b>And</b> the second set of witnesses <b>reversed</b> the order of events in their testimony, saying that the eye injury took place first, <b>and</b> in the same testimony, <b>they rendered</b> the first pair <b>conspiring witnesses,</b> by testifying that they were not present when the events occurred. Since the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> must be interpreted in this manner, it stands to reason that the first case should be explained similarly.
The Gemara analyzes Abaye’s interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And what are the circumstances</b> of the case? The second set of witnesses, who are deemed credible, have established that the injuries did not take place on the date reported by the first set of witnesses. According to their testimony, when did the injuries take place? <b>If the latter</b> witnesses <b>postdated</b> the events, by testifying that the injuries were actually inflicted at a later stage than that mentioned by the first set of witnesses, the first set of witnesses should <b>still be required to pay the</b> full <b>value of a slave to the master.</b>
The reason the first set of witnesses should be liable is <b>that when they</b> sought to <b>impose liability upon the man,</b> i.e., the master, this <b>man was not yet</b> burdened with any <b>liability.</b> When the first set of witnesses testified about the injuries, the master was not yet obligated to emancipate his slave or pay damages. Therefore, these conspiring witnesses should be required to pay these sums, which they had sought to impose on the master. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>the latter</b> set of witnesses <b>predated</b> the time of the injuries, by testifying that they were inflicted at an earlier date than that attested to by the first set of witnesses.
The Gemara continues to analyze the case: <b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the master <b>had not</b> yet <b>stood trial</b> for having injured his slave when the first set of witnesses submitted their testimony, those witnesses <b>should still be required to pay the entire value of the slave to the master, as</b> at the time of their testimony <b>the man,</b> i.e., the master, was <b>not yet liable.</b> The first set of witnesses sought to render the master liable at a time when he was exempt from liability, and therefore they should be obligated to pay him the full value of the slave.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be <b>that</b> the master <b>had</b> already <b>stood trial</b> for having inflicted these injuries, and had been sentenced by the court to emancipate the slave for the first injury and pay him for the second injury. Then, the master evaded payment, and was subsequently brought before another court, where witnesses testified that the first court had established liability for knocking out the tooth first and then blinding the slave’s eye. This testimony was subsequently rendered conspiring testimony by a second set of witnesses, who testified both that the first set of witnesses was not at the scene of the first trial and that the results of the trial were actually reversed, i.e., the master’s liability was for blinding the eye first and then for knocking out the tooth. Since the first set of witnesses, who were rendered conspiring witnesses, sought to increase the master’s liability payment from that of the value of a tooth to that of an eye, they must pay the value of an eye to the master.
Rava sought to infer from this <i>baraita</i> to his opinion that contradiction of testimony is the start of determining that testimony is conspiring testimony. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said to Rav Ashi: From which</b> case in the <i>baraita</i> <b>is the inference of Rava? If we say</b> that his inference is <b>from the first clause,</b> this is difficult. In the case of <b>the first clause,</b> if it involves three sets of witnesses, as claimed by Rava, <b>is the intermediate</b> set of witnesses <b>contradicted</b> and rejected before they are established as conspiring witnesses? The first set of witnesses testified that the eye injury took place after the tooth injury, whereas the intermediate set of witnesses reversed the order. If so, the intermediate set of witnesses sought to lower the master’s payment from the value of an eye to that of a tooth.
Rav Aḥa continues: <b>Since if</b> the second set of witnesses <b>would not have been rendered conspiring witnesses, the testimony would</b> have been <b>established in accordance with</b> their statement, <b>as the judgment would have been decided in accordance with</b> their testimony. The reason their testimony would have determined the ruling is <b>that one hundred dinars</b> is subsumed <b>within two hundred,</b> i.e., testimony concerning a large sum includes testimony concerning a smaller sum.
Rav Aḥa continues: <b>Therefore, it is the first</b> set of witnesses, who testified that the eye injury occurred last, <b>whose</b> testimony would be considered <b>contradicted</b> and rejected, whereas the testimony of <b>the intermediate</b> set of witnesses would <b>not</b> be considered <b>contradicted at all,</b> as it is accepted in full. If so, this is not a case of witnesses who were rejected due to contradiction and then subsequently rendered conspiring witnesses.
Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Aḥa in response: <b>Rava maintains</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> the ruling of <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case involving <b>three sets</b> of witnesses, it is logical to assume that the ruling of <b>the latter clause is also</b> stated <b>with regard to</b> a case involving <b>three</b> sets of witnesses, <b>and</b> Rava <b>infers</b> his ruling <b>from the latter clause.</b>
Rava explains that the latter clause is referring to a case <b>where two</b> witnesses, i.e., the ones mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>come and say:</b> The master <b>knocked out</b> the slave’s <b>tooth and</b> afterward <b>blinded his eye, and</b> the court <b>ruled</b> its <b>judgment in accordance with their statement,</b> obligating the master to emancipate his slave and compensate him for the value of his eye.
<b>And</b> subsequently <b>two other</b> witnesses, who were not mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>come and say</b> that the events were reversed: First the master <b>blinded his</b> slave’s <b>eye and</b> then <b>he knocked out his tooth,</b> so <b>that they contradict</b> the testimony of <b>those first</b> witnesses. At this point the master is obligated to emancipate his slave and pay him only the value of his tooth, as this much was required of him according to both sets of witnesses. <b>And</b> then the first pair <b>were found to be conspiring witnesses.</b> Therefore, as the <i>baraita</i> states, <b>the first</b> set of witnesses <b>pays</b> the <b>value of an eye to the master,</b> less the value of a tooth.
Rava reaches his conclusion based on the following reasoning: <b>And if it enters your mind that</b> the <b>contradiction</b> of testimony <b>is not the start of determining that</b> testimony is <b>conspiring</b> testimony, and witnesses who were first contradicted and then rendered conspiring witnesses are not punished as conspiring witnesses, <b>why must</b> these witnesses <b>pay? They were</b> already <b>contradicted from the outset,</b> before they were shown to be conspiring witnesses. <b>Rather, conclude from</b> the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i> that the <b>contradiction</b> of testimony <b>is the start of determining that</b> testimony is <b>conspiring</b> testimony.
<b>And</b> how could <b>Abaye,</b> who disagrees with Rava, refute this proof? He could <b>say to you: Granted, it is impossible</b> to interpret <b>the first clause without</b> the supposition <b>that</b> there are <b>three sets</b> of witnesses involved. The reason is <b>that</b> it <b>is taught</b> with regard to that first clause: <b>As that is what the master says,</b> i.e., this testimony is satisfactory to the master. The only testimony recorded in the <i>baraita</i> is that the master blinded the slave’s eye and then knocked out his tooth. Why would this be considered satisfactory to the master? It must therefore be assumed that this testimony was preceded by another one that was even less advantageous to the master. That testimony confirmed the injuries but placed the eye injury after the tooth injury, which involves greater liability for the master. Finally, a third set of witnesses must have arrived and rendered the intermediate set as conspiring witnesses, so that there are a total of three sets of witnesses.
<b>But</b> with regard to <b>the latter clause, why do I</b> need to explain it as referring to <b>three sets</b> of witnesses? If you say that it is because the <i>baraita</i> states concerning this case: <b>As that is what the slave says,</b> i.e., this testimony is satisfactory to the slave, this does not prove that there is another testimony, not mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, that is less favorable to the slave than this one.
The reason is <b>that a slave would say anything,</b> i.e., any form of testimony would be favorable to him, <b>as it is satisfactory for him that he should be emancipated.</b> The court’s acceptance of testimony confirming either order of events would result in his emancipation from slavery, and therefore both testimonies are satisfactory to him. Although there is a compelling reason to posit the existence of three sets of witnesses in the first clause, there is no justification to do so in the second clause, and therefore it should be explained as did Abaye, as discussing only two sets of witnesses.
<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to</b> the basic assumption of the <i>baraita</i> that when a master inflicts two injuries upon his Canaanite slave he must indemnify the slave for the second injury. One can <b>say</b> instead that if the master <b>blinded his</b> slave’s <b>eye,</b>

Daf 74b

the slave <b>should go</b> free <b>on account of his eye,</b> and if he <b>knocked out his tooth</b> he <b>should go</b> free <b>on account of his tooth,</b> and if the master both <b>blinded his eye and knocked out his tooth,</b> the slave <b>should go</b> free <b>on account of</b> both <b>his eye and his tooth,</b> without the master having to pay damages for the loss of his tooth.
<b>Abaye said</b> to him in response: <b>With regard to your</b> claim, <b>the verse states:</b> “And if a man smites the eye of his slave or the eye of his maidservant and destroys it, he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake” (Exodus 21:26). The phrase <b>“for his eye’s sake”</b> indicates: <b>But not for the sake of</b> both <b>his eye and his tooth.</b> The same can be inferred from the subsequent verse: “And if he smites out his bondman’s tooth or his bondwoman’s tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake” (Exodus 21:27). The phrase <b>“for his tooth’s sake”</b> indicates: <b>But not for the sake of</b> both <b>his eye and his tooth.</b>
The Gemara returns to Rava’s opinion that the contradiction of testimony is the start of determining that testimony is conspiring testimony. <b>Rav Idi bar Avin said: We too</b> can <b>learn</b> from the mishna that Rava’s claim is correct, as it teaches (72b): If one <b>stole</b> an ox or a sheep, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>slaughtered</b> the animal <b>or sold</b> it, also <b>based on</b> the testimony of the same witnesses, <b>and</b> these witnesses <b>were found</b> to be <b>conspiring witnesses,</b> these conspiring witnesses <b>must pay everything,</b> i.e., not only the principal amount but also the fourfold or fivefold payment.
<b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where they testified concerning the theft and then testified concerning the slaughter, and they were</b> subsequently <b>rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the theft and then were rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the slaughter?</b>
Rav Idi bar Avin states his inference: <b>But once they were rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the theft,</b> their testimony <b>with regard to the slaughter</b> is in effect <b>contradicted,</b> i.e., nullified, as testimony concerning the slaughter of an animal without prior testimony establishing that the animal was stolen is meaningless. <b>And</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the witnesses <b>must pay everything. And if it enters your mind</b> that the <b>contradiction</b> of testimony <b>is not the start of determining that</b> testimony is <b>conspiring</b> testimony, <b>why should they pay</b> a fine <b>for</b> lying about the <b>slaughter?</b> Their testimony concerning the slaughter was rendered irrelevant before it was established as conspiring testimony. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> this mishna that the <b>contradiction</b> of testimony <b>is the start of determining that</b> testimony is <b>conspiring</b> testimony?
The Sages <b>say</b> in refutation of this inference: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the witnesses were <b>rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the slaughter first,</b> before they were rendered conspiring witnesses in their testimony concerning the theft itself. In this case, the testimony concerning the slaughter was not rendered irrelevant before it was rendered conspiring testimony.
<b>And</b> this is a matter <b>in the dispute</b> between other <i>amora’im</i>, before Rava and Abaye discussed it. As it was stated: With regard to <b>witnesses</b> to a capital crime <b>who were</b> first <b>contradicted</b> by two other witnesses <b>and ultimately were rendered conspiring witnesses,</b> this is a matter of dispute between <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar. One said:</b> These witnesses <b>are killed,</b> like all conspiring witnesses in a capital case, as the contradiction of testimony is the start of determining that testimony is conspiring testimony, <b>and one said: They are not killed.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>It may be concluded</b> that <b>it is Rabbi Elazar who says they are not killed. As Rabbi Elazar says: Witnesses who were contradicted in</b> a case involving the taking of <b>a life,</b> i.e., a capital case, <b>are flogged</b> for violating the prohibition: “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor” (Exodus 20:13).
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>it is Rabbi Elazar who says</b> that witnesses to a capital crime who were first contradicted and ultimately found to be conspiring witnesses <b>are killed, why are they flogged</b> in this case? There is always the possibility that they might be rendered conspiring witnesses, which would render them liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. Consequently, this is a case of <b>a prohibition given as warning</b> of liability <b>for court</b>-imposed <b>capital punishment, and</b> there is a principle that <b>one is not flogged for</b> violating <b>any prohibition given as warning</b> of liability <b>for court</b>-imposed <b>capital punishment.</b>
<b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> this statement that <b>it is Rabbi Elazar who says</b> that witnesses to a capital crime who were first contradicted and ultimately were found to be conspiring witnesses <b>are not killed?</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>It may be concluded</b> that this is so.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rabbi Elazar’s opinion that witnesses who were contradicted in a capital case are flogged. Why <b>are</b> they <b>flogged</b> simply because their testimony was contradicted? <b>They are two</b> witnesses, <b>and</b> they are contradicted by <b>two</b> other witnesses. <b>What did you see</b> in the testimony of the second set of witnesses <b>that</b> leads <b>you</b> to <b>rely on those</b> witnesses to the extent that the first set of witnesses is flogged? You could just as well <b>rely on these</b> witnesses, i.e., the first witnesses. How can the court ever determine with certainty that a given testimony is false based merely on contradictory testimony?
<b>Abaye said:</b> The contradiction to which Rabbi Elazar is referring involves a case <b>where</b> the witnesses testified that they saw a certain person murdered, and subsequently the individual who was allegedly <b>killed came</b> to the court <b>on his feet,</b> conclusively disproving their testimony.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>stole</b> an ox or a sheep, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>slaughtered or sold</b> the stolen animal, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness or based on his own</b> admission, i.e., he himself admitted that he performed these acts, without there being any witness testimony, <b>he pays</b> the <b>double payment, but he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>on Shabbat,</b> which is a capital offense, or if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>for the</b> purpose of <b>idol worship,</b> or if <b>he stole his father’s</b> animal <b>and</b> subsequently <b>his father died, and afterward he slaughtered or sold</b> it, or if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and</b> subsequently <b>he consecrated</b> it as an offering <b>and afterward he slaughtered or sold</b> it, in all these cases the thief <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment, but he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In the case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>for which</b> the owner <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> to replace with another animal if one of the original animals that one stole is lost or dies, the thief is obligated to <b>pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment</b> if he slaughters one of the animals. If it is a sacrificial animal <b>for which</b> the owner <b>bears no</b> financial <b>responsibility,</b> the thief <b>is exempt</b> from the fourfold or fivefold payment.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if the fact that the thief slaughtered or sold the animal was established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness,</b> he is exempt from the fourfold of fivefold payment. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b>
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: By stating this case, the mishna <b>teaches us this</b> <i>halakha</i>: The case of the thief slaughtering the animal established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness is similar to</b> a case where it is established <b>based on his own</b> admission. <b>Just as</b> in the case where the slaughter is established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness, if one</b> other <b>witness comes</b> and corroborates the testimony of the first, he <b>joins together with</b> the first witness and together their testimony is rendered a valid testimony of two, and the thief <b>becomes obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>so too,</b> where the slaughter is established <b>based on his own</b> admission, <b>if witnesses come</b> after his admission he <b>becomes obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara comments: This interpretation of the mishna serves <b>to exclude</b> that <b>which Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says. As Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> One who <b>admits</b> he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is exempt</b> from payment, even if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability.
Since Rav Huna’s <i>halakha</i> was mentioned, the Gemara discusses in detail <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> One who <b>admits</b> he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is exempt</b> from payment, even if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability. <b>Rav Ḥisda raised an objection to Rav Huna</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving Rabban Gamliel, who blinded the eye of his</b> Canaanite <b>slave Tavi, and he experienced great joy</b> as a result. Rabban Gamliel had long wanted to emancipate Tavi, but it is generally prohibited to emancipate a Canaanite slave. The injury provided a fortuitous opportunity for Rabban Gamliel to emancipate his slave, as blinding the eye of one’s slave results in his emancipation (see Exodus 21:27).
Rabban Gamliel <b>encountered Rabbi Yehoshua</b> and <b>said to him: Do you know that my slave Tavi was emancipated?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: Why?</b> What circumstances enabled you to emancipate him? Rabban Gamliel <b>said to him:</b> I was able to do so, <b>as I blinded his eye.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to</b> Rabban Gamliel: <b>Your statement is nothing,</b> and is not grounds for his emancipation, <b>as he has no witnesses</b> who can testify that you did this to him. The principle is that one does not pay a fine based on his own admission. One pays a fine only based on the testimony of witnesses. The requirement to emancipate one’s slave after injuring his eye is a type of fine.
The Gemara infers from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But</b> if Tavi <b>had witnesses</b> who could testify with regard to the injury, Rabban Gamliel would be <b>obligated</b> to emancipate him, even if they testify after Rabban Gamliel’s admission. <b>And we</b> can <b>learn from</b> this that one who <b>admits</b> that he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is liable,</b> even if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify with regard to his liability.
Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: This case involving <b>Rabban Gamliel is different, as he admitted</b> to his actions when he was <b>not in the presence of a court.</b> An admission not in the presence of a court does not exempt the perpetrator from paying the relevant fine. The Gemara challenges: <b>But Rabbi Yehoshua was the president of the court,</b> so it is likely that the encounter took place in court.

Daf 75a

The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, Rabbi Yehoshua <b>was not</b> present <b>in court</b> when Rabban Gamliel encountered him.
The Gemara asks a question from a different source: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to</b> Rabban Gamliel: <b>Your statement is nothing, as you have already admitted</b> to inflicting the injury yourself? This indicates that even if witnesses would subsequently testify about the injury, Rabban Gamliel would not emancipate Tavi.
The Gemara suggests: <b>What, is it not</b> the case that the difference between these two <i>baraitot</i> <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>? This <i>tanna</i></b> of the first <i>baraita</i>, <b>who says</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua’s statement was: <b>As you have no witnesses, holds</b> that one who <b>admits</b> that he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is liable</b> to pay the fine if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability. <b>And that <i>tanna</i></b> of the second <i>baraita</i>, <b>who says</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua’s statement was: <b>As you have already admitted, holds</b> that one who <b>admits</b> that he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is exempt</b> from payment, even if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No;</b> it is possible to understand the <i>baraitot</i> differently. <b>Everyone agrees</b> that one who <b>admits</b> he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is exempt,</b> even if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability. <b>And they disagree with regard to</b> the following: <b>This <i>tanna</i>, who says</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua said: <b>As you have no witnesses, holds that</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>was outside the court</b> when Rabban Gamliel encountered him, and therefore his admission is disregarded. <b>And that <i>tanna</i>, who says</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua said: <b>As you have already admitted, holds</b> that Rabbi Yehoshua <b>was in the court</b> when Rabban Gamliel met him, so Rabban Gamliel’s admission is a valid admission.
The Gemara analyzes in detail the dispute alluded to above: <b>It was stated</b> with regard to one who <b>admits</b> that he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine, and afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability, that <b>Rav says</b> he is <b>exempt, and Shmuel says</b> he is <b>liable.</b>
<b>Rava bar Ahilai said: What is the reason for</b> the ruling of <b>Rav?</b> With regard to theft, which is subject to a fine of double payment, the Torah states: “If the theft shall be found in his possession alive, whether it is an ox, or a donkey, or a sheep, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:3). The verb for “shall be found” is doubled, as the verse states “<i>himmatze timmatze</i>.” Rav derives from the repetition that there are two matters that are found: The double payment is imposed only <b>if it is found</b> [<i>himmatze</i>], i.e., it is revealed that he stole the item, <b>through</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses,</b> and the theft <b>is found</b> [<i>timmatze</i>], as determined <b>through judges.</b> This <b>excludes one who incriminates himself</b> through his own admission.
Rav asks: But <b>why do I</b> need the Torah to teach this here? This principle is already <b>derived from</b> a different source: <b>“The one whom the judges convict</b> shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8), which indicates that self-incrimination is insufficient to render one liable for double payment. <b>Rather, conclude from</b> the fact that there are two verses to serve as the source for this principle that one who <b>admits</b> he is liable <b>to</b> pay <b>a fine is exempt</b> from paying even if <b>afterward witnesses come</b> and testify to his liability. The second verse teaches this additional novelty.
<b>And Shmuel</b> would explain the double expression differently. He could have <b>said to you: That</b> verse <b>is necessary to</b> teach that <b>a thief himself</b> must pay double payment, i.e., the double payment is imposed not only upon a bailee who takes a false oath that the article entrusted to him was stolen, but it is also imposed upon a thief, <b>as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught</b> earlier in this chapter (63b).
<b>Rav raised an objection to Shmuel</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: If a thief <b>saw witnesses who were approaching</b> with the intent to testify against him, <b>and</b> at that point <b>he said:</b> I admit that <b>I stole</b> an animal, <b>but I did not slaughter or sell</b> it, <b>he pays only the principal.</b> This indicates that even if those witnesses subsequently testify, the thief remains exempt from the double payment as well as the fourfold or fivefold payment. Shmuel <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>With what are we dealing here</b> in this <i>baraita</i>? With a case <b>where the witnesses returned back,</b> i.e., ultimately they did not testify.
Rav raised an objection: <b>But</b> this interpretation is impossible, as can be seen <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Let the witnesses come and testify.</b> This means that their testimony will be accepted and the thief will be required to pay the relevant fines. <b>By inference</b> it may be deduced <b>that the first <i>tanna</i></b> holds that <b>no,</b> there is no point in the witnesses testifying, as the thief will be exempt in any case.
<b>Shmuel said to</b> Rav: <b>Isn’t there</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, which stands in accordance with my</b> opinion? When I said that one who admits that he is liable to pay a fine and afterward witnesses testified that he committed that act is deemed liable, <b>I said</b> this ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>According to Shmuel,</b> his opinion on this matter <b>is certainly</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as he himself was forced to admit that his opinion is in accordance only with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, not that of the first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>. But <b>according to Rav, shall we say</b> that his opinion too <b>is</b> necessarily subject to this dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: I say</b> my opinion in accordance with the rulings of both <i>tanna’im</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon. Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says</b> that the testimony of the witnesses obligates the thief to pay a fine even after his admission <b>only there,</b> in that specific case, <b>because</b> the thief <b>admitted</b> his guilt solely <b>due to</b> his <b>fear</b> of the impending testimony <b>of the witnesses. But here,</b> in an ordinary case of admission, <b>where</b> there is no impending testimony to incriminate him, and <b>he admits</b> his guilt <b>of his own</b> volition, <b>even Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon,</b> would <b>concede</b> that the thief is exempt from payment even if witnesses subsequently testify that he is liable.
<b>Rav Hamnuna said: Rav’s statement is</b> more <b>reasonable</b> in a case <b>where</b> the thief <b>says: I stole</b> an item, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he stole</b> that item. In that case it is logical that the thief is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fine despite the witnesses’ testimony, because he at least <b>obligated himself to</b> pay <b>the principal</b> amount via his admission.
<b>But</b> if <b>he says: I did not steal</b> anything, <b>and witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he did steal</b> an animal, <b>and subsequently</b> the thief <b>says:</b> Yes, I did steal the animal, and <b>I</b> also <b>slaughtered</b> it, <b>or</b> I also <b>sold</b> it, <b>and witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he slaughtered or sold</b> it, he is <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. The reason he is liable is <b>that</b> through his admission he sought to <b>exempt himself from any</b> payment whatsoever. In order for an admission to exempt the perpetrator from a fine, it must include an admission that he is liable to pay some payment.
<b>Rava said:</b> In this case <b>I have gotten the better [<i>kipaḥti</i>] of the elders of the school of Rav,</b> which is a reference to Rav Hamnuna. The reason is <b>that</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that discusses <b>Rabban Gamliel</b> injuring his slave, he <b>was</b> seeking to <b>exempt himself from any payment</b> whatsoever through his admission, <b>and</b> yet earlier in the Gemara it was said that <b>Rav Ḥisda stated</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>to Rav Huna</b> to challenge Rav Huna’s opinion, <b>and</b> Rav Huna <b>did not answer him</b> that Rabban Gamliel’s case was different because his admission served to exempt him entirely.
The Gemara notes: <b>It was also stated</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> the same opinion as Rav Hamnuna. If a thief says: <b>I stole</b> an item, <b>and witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he stole</b> that item, the thief is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fine despite the witnesses’ testimony, because he at least <b>obligates himself,</b> through his admission, <b>to</b> pay <b>the principal. But</b> if <b>he says: I did not steal</b> anything, <b>and witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he did steal</b> an animal, <b>and subsequently</b> the thief <b>says:</b> Yes, I did steal the animal, and <b>I</b> also <b>slaughtered</b> it, <b>or</b> I also <b>sold</b> it, and then <b>witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he slaughtered or sold</b> it, he is <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>as</b> through his admission <b>he was</b> seeking to <b>exempt himself from any</b> payment whatsoever.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> There is <b>a mishna and a <i>baraita</i></b> that are <b>also precisely</b> formulated in accordance with this opinion. <b>The mishna</b> is <b>as we learned</b> (74b): If one <b>stole</b> an ox or a sheep, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>slaughtered or sold</b> the stolen animal, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness or based on his own</b> admission, <b>he pays</b> the <b>double payment, but he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
<b>Why do I</b> need the mishna to <b>teach</b> in the beginning of this case: If one <b>stole</b> an ox or a sheep, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses? <b>Let</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the case more simply: If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and</b> then <b>slaughtered or sold</b> it, as established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness or based on his own</b> admission, <b>he pays only the principal.</b> This would serve to teach the same principle in a less complicated manner, without the need for two additional witnesses.

Daf 75b

<b>Rather, is it not</b> correct to say that by citing the more complicated case, <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>teaches us: It is</b> only in this case, where it is established that the thief <b>stole</b> an animal <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses, <b>and</b> it is established that <b>he slaughtered</b> or sold it <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness or based on his own</b> admission, and <b>where he does not obligate himself</b> through his admission <b>to</b> pay <b>the principal,</b> that he is obligated to pay the fine.
The Gemara elaborates: In other words, it is only in <b>that</b> case, where the theft is established based on the testimony of two witnesses, <b>that we say</b> that liability <b>based on his own</b> admission <b>is similar to the</b> testimony <b>of one witness,</b> in that <b>just as when</b> the slaughter is established <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness,</b> if <b>one</b> other <b>witness</b> later <b>comes he joins together with</b> the first witness and together their testimony is rendered a valid testimony of two witnesses and the thief <b>becomes liable</b> to pay, so <b>too,</b> in a case when the slaughter is established <b>based on his own</b> admission, <b>if witnesses</b> subsequently <b>come</b> and testify, he <b>becomes liable</b> to pay the fine, as his admission would not have rendered him liable to pay any payment.
<b>But</b> if it is established that the thief <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered or sold</b> it, all <b>based on</b> the testimony of <b>one witness or based on his own</b> admission, in <b>which</b> case through his admission <b>he obligates himself to</b> pay <b>the principal</b> amount, <b>we do not say</b> that when witnesses testify subsequent <b>to his own</b> admission it is <b>similar</b> to when they arrive subsequent <b>to the</b> testimony <b>of one witness,</b> and he is liable to pay the fine in both cases. Rather, since in this case his admission would have rendered him liable to pay the principal due to the fact that the theft was not established based on the testimony of two witnesses, it is considered a proper admission, which exempts him from paying the fine.
The <b><i>baraita</i></b> that supports Rav Hamnuna’s opinion is the one cited earlier, <b>as it is taught:</b> If a thief <b>saw witnesses who were approaching</b> with the intent to testify against him, <b>and</b> at that point he <b>said:</b> I admit that <b>I stole</b> an animal, <b>but I did not slaughter or sell</b> it, <b>he pays only the principal. Why do I</b> need the <i>baraita</i> <b>to teach: And</b> the thief <b>said:</b> I admit that <b>I stole</b> an animal <b>but I did not slaughter or sell</b> it? <b>Let it teach</b> a simpler case, in which the thief said <b>either: I stole</b> the animal, <b>or: I slaughtered</b> it, <b>or: I sold</b> it.
<b>Rather,</b> by choosing the more complicated case, <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us: The</b> only <b>reason that</b> the thief <b>is exempt</b> from payment <b>is that he says: I stole</b> the animal, <b>as</b> in that case <b>he obligated himself to</b> pay <b>the principal. But</b> if <b>he says: I did not steal, and witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he did steal</b> an animal, <b>and subsequently he</b> changed his claim and <b>says: I slaughtered</b> it, <b>or: I sold</b> it, <b>and</b> then <b>witnesses came</b> and confirmed <b>that he slaughtered or sold</b> it, in which case the thief <b>did not obligate himself to pay the principal</b> or any other payment, he would be <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>Apparently, an admission to</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of a stolen animal <b>is not</b> considered a valid <b>admission,</b> as such an admission does not obligate the perpetrator to pay a fine.
The Gemara <b>says,</b> in rejection of this second proof: <b>No,</b> it is possible to explain the reason the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> chose to present this case in a different manner, as it <b>teaches us this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>itself: That once</b> the thief <b>says: I stole</b> the animal, <b>even if he</b> also <b>says: I did not slaughter or sell</b> it, <b>and</b> later <b>witnesses came</b> and testified <b>that he slaughtered or sold it,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>What is the reason</b> for this exemption?
The reason is that <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah that there is <b>a payment of four</b> sheep for a sheep and <b>five</b> oxen for an ox (see Exodus 21:37). This indicates that a thief can be rendered liable to pay, respectively, a fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>but not a fourfold payment</b> for an ox, <b>nor a threefold payment</b> for a sheep. In other words, one should not view the fines as independent of each other, that if the thief is found with the animal he pays as a fine the double payment, and if he slaughtered or sold it he pays a different fine, i.e., the fourfold or fivefold payment. Rather, the fourfold or fivefold payment comprises the principal, the double payment, and an additional two or three times the principal. By admitting to his act of theft, the thief exempts himself from the double payment, and the remaining fine for slaughtering a sheep would be a threefold payment, or a fourfold payment for an ox, which are not mandated by the Torah.
The Gemara proposes: <b>Let us say</b> that the opinion of Rav Hamnuna and Rabbi Yoḥanan is the <b>subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> As it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>two</b> witnesses <b>testify that</b> some-one <b>stole</b> an animal, <b>and two</b> others <b>testify</b> against <b>him that he slaughtered or sold</b> the animal, and the <b>witnesses</b> who had testified concerning the <b>theft were rendered conspiring witnesses,</b> the thief is exempt from all payment, as <b>testimony that was partially invalidated is entirely invalidated.</b> If the testimony concerning the theft was undermined, the testimony concerning the slaughter or sale is thereby rendered irrelevant. Consequently, the alleged thief is exempt from any payment.
If <b>the witnesses</b> who testified concerning <b>the slaughter</b> or sale <b>were rendered conspiring witnesses,</b> but the testimony concerning the theft remains credible, the thief <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment, and</b> the conspiring witnesses <b>pay a threefold payment,</b> as that is the loss they sought to impose on the thief. The Sages <b>said in the name of Sumakhos:</b> The witnesses <b>pay</b> the <b>double payment, and</b> the thief <b>pays a threefold payment for an ox and a twofold</b> payment <b>for a ram.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara analyzes the statement of Sumakhos: <b>To which</b> clause in the <i>baraita</i> <b>is Sumakhos referring? If we say</b> that he is referring <b>to the first clause,</b> in which the testimony concerning the theft is invalidated, this is impossible. <b>Doesn’t Sumakhos</b> accept the principle that <b>testimony that was partially invalidated is entirely invalidated,</b> in this case rendering the testimony concerning the slaughter or sale irrelevant if there is no testimony concerning the theft?
<b>But rather,</b> he must be referring <b>to the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, in which the testimony concerning the slaughter or sale is invalidated. This, too, is impossible, as in this case <b>the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>say well,</b> i.e., what they state is reasonable, <b>and</b> the thief <b>pays</b> the <b>double payment and</b> the witnesses <b>pay a threefold payment.</b> On what basis would Sumakhos dispute this ruling?
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that Sumakhos is referring to a different case entirely, one that is not mentioned explicitly in the <i>baraita</i>, and <b>a different matter is</b> at the core of the dispute <b>between them.</b> Sumakhos is referring to a case <b>where two</b> people <b>come</b> and <b>say to</b> the thief: <b>You stole</b> an animal. The thief <b>said to them</b> in reply: <b>Yes, I did steal</b> the animal, <b>and</b> moreover, <b>I slaughtered</b> it, <b>or: I sold</b> it. <b>But I did not steal</b> it <b>in your presence,</b> and your testimony that you saw me steal it is false. <b>And</b> subsequently the thief <b>brought</b> new <b>witnesses who rendered</b> the original witnesses <b>conspiring witnesses,</b> by testifying that they were in a different place at the time they claimed that the theft occurred, thereby proving <b>that</b> the thief <b>did not steal in their presence. And</b> finally, <b>the owner</b> of the animal <b>brought</b> other <b>witnesses who testified that</b> the thief <b>stole</b> the animal <b>and slaughtered or sold</b> it.
<b>And</b> Sumakhos and the Rabbis <b>disagree over</b> whether <b>an admission to</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of a stolen animal is a valid admission, even though it does not lead to liability to pay any payment. Both parties to the dispute agree that the admission of a perpetrator only in response to the testimony of witnesses is not a valid admission.
The dispute between them is <b>that the Rabbis maintain that even though</b> the thief’s <b>admission concerning</b> the <b>theft</b> itself is not a valid admission because it is <b>due</b> only <b>to the witnesses</b> who have testified against him that <b>he admits</b> his guilt, nevertheless, his <b>admission concerning</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of the animal <b>is</b> a valid <b>admission,</b> despite the fact it does not render the thief liable to pay a fine, <b>and</b> he is therefore <b>exempt</b> from the fourfold or fivefold payment. The conspiring witnesses must pay the double payment to the thief, since this is the amount of financial damage they sought to impose on him, while the thief pays the double payment to the owner, as valid witnesses ultimately testified that he stole the animal.
<b>And Sumakhos maintains</b> that <b>since</b> the <b>admission concerning</b> the <b>theft</b> itself is not a valid admission because it was <b>due</b> only <b>to</b> the testimony of the <b>witnesses that he admits</b> his guilt, so too, the admission <b>concerning</b> the <b>slaughter is not</b> a valid <b>admission,</b> because it does not obligate him to pay a fine, as stated by Rav Hamnuna and Rabbi Yoḥanan.
<b>And</b> consequently, <b>those first witnesses</b> to the theft, <b>who were rendered conspiring witnesses, pay</b> the <b>double payment,</b> as that is the amount of financial damage they sought to impose on him, <b>and</b> the thief <b>pays</b> the double payment to the owner of the animal, as valid witnesses ultimately testified that he stole it, and since his admission is invalid he must pay an additional <b>threefold</b> payment, for a total of a fivefold payment <b>for an ox, or a twofold</b> payment, for a total of a fourfold payment, <b>for a ram.</b> If this is their dispute, Sumakhos is in agreement with the opinion of Rav Hamnuna and Rabbi Yoḥanan, while the Rabbis disagree with this opinion.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: No;</b> it is possible to explain the <i>baraita</i> differently, as follows: <b>Everyone,</b> i.e., both Sumakhos and the Rabbis, maintains that <b>an admission concerning</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of a stolen animal <b>is not</b> a valid <b>admission,</b> as it does not render the perpetrator liable to pay any payment.
<b>Rather, they disagree over</b> the concept of <b>testimony that you cannot render conspiratory</b> testimony. Sumakhos and the Rabbis disagree with regard to a case <b>where witnesses come and say to</b> the thief: <b>You stole</b> an animal. <b>And</b> the thief <b>said to them</b> in response: <b>I did steal</b> an animal, <b>and</b> moreover, <b>I slaughtered</b> it, <b>or: I sold</b> it. <b>But</b> you are false witnesses, as <b>it was not in your presence that I stole</b> the animal, <b>but in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so. And</b> the thief subsequently <b>brought witnesses who established</b> the first set of witnesses <b>as conspiring witnesses</b> by testifying that the thief <b>did not steal</b> the animal <b>in their presence. And</b> finally, <b>so-and-so and so-and-so,</b> the two people mentioned by the thief, <b>came and testified against</b> the thief, saying that <b>he stole</b> the animal <b>and</b> also <b>slaughtered or sold</b> it.
<b>And</b> it is <b>with regard to this</b> point that <b>they disagree, that the Rabbis maintain</b> that the testimony of so-and-so and so-and-so is <b>testimony that you cannot render conspiratory</b> testimony, as the thief himself admits that their testimony is true. <b>And any testimony that you cannot render conspiratory</b> testimony <b>is not</b> considered valid <b>testimony.</b> Their testimony is therefore discounted, which leaves only the thief’s statement. The thief pays the money he admitted he owes, i.e., the principal of the theft, but he is exempt from paying a fine. Meanwhile, the first witnesses, who had been rendered conspiring witnesses, pay the thief the double payment.
<b>And Sumakhos maintains</b> that <b>testimony that you cannot render conspiratory</b> testimony <b>is</b> nevertheless considered valid <b>testimony.</b> Therefore, the testimony of so-and-so and so-and-so is valid, and the thief must pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. Sumakhos states that the thief pays a threefold payment for an ox and a twofold payment for a ram. The reason is that the thief receives a double payment from the first, conspiring witnesses, which he gives to the owner of the animal, along with the remainder of the payment. This amounts to a threefold payment for an ox and twofold payment for a ram that he is required to pay from his own funds.
The Gemara asks: <b>But do we not maintain</b> as an accepted principle <b>that testimony that you cannot render conspiratory</b> testimony <b>is not</b> valid <b>testimony?</b> It is not reasonable to suggest that Sumakhos would disagree with that principle. The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> statement <b>applies</b> in a case <b>where</b> witnesses say <b>that they do not know on which day</b> or <b>at which time</b> of day the events in question occurred, in which case no one could ever say to them: You were in a different place at that time, thereby rendering them conspiring witnesses. With regard to such a case one can say <b>that</b> in effect <b>there is no testimony at all,</b> as the vague statement of the witnesses does not allow them to be prosecuted as conspiring witnesses. <b>But here</b> the thief is <b>supporting</b> their testimony, which renders it more credible.
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that the Sages stated in the name of Sumakhos: The witnesses <b>pay</b> the <b>double payment.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the thief admits that he stole</b> the animal, <b>he is required to pay the principal</b> amount regardless of any subsequent testimony provided by witnesses. Why, then, should the conspiring witnesses be required to pay a double payment, which includes the principal amount? <b>Rabbi Elazar says in the name of Rav: Teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> differently, and instead say that Sumakhos said that the witnesses are liable for

Daf 76a

the <b>payment of</b> the extra part of the <b>double payment,</b> i.e., the amount that exceeds the principal.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>one stole</b> an animal <b>and</b> subsequently <b>he consecrated it</b> as an offering, <b>and afterward he slaughtered or sold</b> it, the thief pays the double payment but he does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Sages <b>say: Granted, he is not liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>for the slaughter</b> of the animal, <b>as when he slaughtered</b> it, <b>he slaughtered</b> an animal <b>belonging to the Temple</b> treasury, <b>and he did not slaughter</b> the animal <b>belonging to its owner.</b>
<b>But let him be liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>for</b> having <b>consecrated</b> the animal in the first place, as <b>what</b> difference <b>is it to me</b> if <b>he sold</b> the animal <b>to an ordinary</b> person, and <b>what</b> difference <b>is it to me</b> if <b>he sold it to Heaven</b> by consecrating it? Consecration should be considered tantamount to a sale, as in either case ownership of the animal is transferred to another party.
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna taught? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>for which</b> the owner <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> to replace with another animal if one of the original animals is lost or dies <b>are</b> considered <b>to be in the possession of their owner</b> (see 74b). The mishna is referring a case where the thief consecrated the animal in such a manner that he is obligated to replace it if it is lost or damaged before being sacrificed. One consequence of this potential financial loss is that the animal is considered to be in the thief’s possession even after he consecrated it. Therefore, the animal’s consecration is not tantamount to a sale to another party.
The Gemara rejects this answer: <b>But from</b> the fact that <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> it follows that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, which is stated before his opinion is introduced, <b>is not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
<b>Rather, with what are we dealing here</b> in the mishna? We are dealing <b>with</b> a case where the thief consecrated the animal as <b>an offering of lesser sanctity, and</b> the mishna is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says</b> that <b>an offering of lesser sanctity is the property of</b> its putative <b>owner, and is</b> considered <b>in his possession.</b> Therefore, its consecration is not tantamount to a sale to another party.
The Gemara rejects this answer as well: <b>But what</b> would be the <i>halakha</i> had the thief consecrated the animal as <b>an offering of the most sacred order?</b> Would he have to <b>pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment?</b> If so, <b>rather than teaching</b> the following in <b>the earlier clause</b> of the mishna (70a), in the case that stands in opposition to this one: If <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>and afterward he consecrated</b> it, <b>he must pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>distinguish and teach</b> the opposing <i>halakha</i> <b>within</b> the same category <b>itself.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: The <i>tanna</i> could have taught: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that the thief is exempt if he consecrated the stolen animal and then slaughtered or sold it, <b>said?</b> It is said only if he consecrated the animal <b>as an offering of lesser sanctity; but</b> if he consecrated it <b>as an offering of the most sacred order he pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment,</b> as the consecration itself would be tantamount to a sale to another party.
<b>Rather,</b> the Gemara states that <b>actually there is no difference</b> whether the thief consecrates the animal as <b>an offering of the most sacred order</b> and <b>there is no difference</b> whether he consecrates it as <b>an offering of lesser sanctity. And as</b> for the matter that presented <b>a difficulty for you,</b> namely: <b>What</b> difference <b>is it to me</b> if <b>he sold</b> the animal <b>to an ordinary</b> person and <b>what</b> difference <b>is it to me</b> if <b>he sold it to Heaven</b> by consecration, one can answer as follows: If someone, e.g., Reuven, <b>sold</b> an ox <b>to an ordinary</b> person, e.g., Shimon, <b>at the outset</b> it was <b>Reuven’s ox and now,</b> after the sale, <b>it is Shimon’s ox.</b> By contrast, if <b>he sold it to Heaven,</b> i.e., he consecrated it as an offering, it is not considered to have been transferred into the possession of another party, as <b>at the outset</b> it was <b>Reuven’s ox and now,</b> after consecration, <b>it is</b> still <b>Reuven’s ox.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In the case of sacrificial animals for which the owner bears financial responsibility to replace with another animal if one of the original animals that one stole is lost or dies, the thief is obligated to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment if he slaughters one of the animals. If it is a sacrificial animal for which the owner bears no financial responsibility, the thief is exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment. At this stage the Gemara assumes that Rabbi Shimon requires the fourfold or fivefold payment as a fine for the act of consecration itself rather than for the act of slaughtering the animal. The Gemara <b>says: Although Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that there is a logic of: <b>What</b> difference <b>is it to me</b> if <b>he sold</b> the animal <b>to an ordinary</b> person and <b>what</b> difference <b>is it to me</b> if <b>he sold it to Heaven</b> via consecration, nevertheless, he <b>should have</b> said <b>the opposite.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: He should have said that if they are <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>for which one bears</b> financial <b>responsibility,</b> the thief is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fourfold or fivefold payment. In other words, if the thief stole a non-sacred animal and subsequently consecrated it as an offering in such a manner that he bears responsibility to replace it, he should be exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment for the act of consecration. The reason is <b>that</b> the animal <b>has not yet left his possession,</b> and therefore this act of consecration should not be considered a sale.
By contrast, if they are <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>for which one does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility,</b> the thief should be <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. If the thief stole a non-sacred animal and then consecrated it as an offering in such a way that he does not bear responsibility to replace it, he should be liable to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment for the act of consecration, <b>as he has</b> thereby <b>removed</b> the animal <b>from his possession.</b>
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> is not discussing the issue of whether the consecration of an animal is tantamount to its sale. Rather, <b>he is referring to a different matter,</b> one that is not explicitly mentioned in the mishna.
<b>And this is what</b> the mishna <b>is teaching: One who steals</b> an animal <b>after a thief</b> has already stolen it, i.e., he steals it from the thief, does not pay the double payment, and if he slaughtered or sold the animal he <b>does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment. And similarly, one who steals consecrated</b> property <b>from the house of</b> its <b>owner</b> is exempt from the double payment, and if it was a sacrificial animal and the thief slaughtered or sold it, <b>he is exempt</b> from the fourfold or fivefold payment.
<b>What is the reason</b> for this last ruling? The reason is as it is written: “If a man gives his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard <b>and it was stolen from the house of the man,</b> if the thief shall be found he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). The phrase “from the house of the man” indicates that a thief is obligated to pay the double payment only when they are stolen from a person, <b>but not</b> if the item in question was stolen <b>out of</b> the <b>house of the Temple</b> treasury.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> If the stolen items were <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>for which</b> the owner <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility,</b> the thief who steals them <b>is liable</b> to pay the double payment, as well as the fourfold or fivefold payment if he slaughters or sells them. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Since the owner must replace the animals, <b>one applies</b> to this case the phrase <b>“and it was stolen from the house of the man.” But</b> if the stolen animals are those for <b>which</b> the owner <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility,</b> the thief is <b>exempt</b> from the double payment and from the fourfold and fivefold payment, <b>as one does not apply</b> to this case the phrase <b>“and it was stolen from the house of the man.”</b>
<b>Now, we have heard</b> elsewhere <b>concerning Rabbi Shimon that he said:</b> An act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> for accomplishing its full ritual purpose <b>is not considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter</b> at all. And if the thief slaughtered the <b>sacrificial</b> animal he stole, this <b>is also</b> an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> for accomplishing its full ritual purpose, as it does not render the animal’s meat fit for consumption, in light of the <i>halakha</i> that it is prohibited to eat a sacrificial animal slaughtered outside the Temple.
<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the thief <b>slaughters</b> the animal, <b>unblemished, inside</b> the Temple, <b>for the sake of</b> its <b>owner.</b> In this case, its meat may be eaten.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> by slaughtering and sacrificing the sacrificial animal on behalf of the owner, it is as though the <b>principal,</b> i.e., the animal itself, has been <b>returned to the owner,</b> and the fourfold or fivefold payment should no longer apply. The owner had designated the animal as his offering, and it was in fact used for that purpose. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Avin said</b> in response: This is referring to a situation <b>where the</b> animal’s <b>blood was spilled</b> before it could be sprinkled on the altar. Consequently, the owner did not achieve atonement through this offering, which is why it is not considered as though the animal has been returned to the owner.
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he cited a different version of this answer, and said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the thief <b>slaughters</b> the animal, <b>unblemished, inside</b> the Temple, but <b>not for the sake of</b> its <b>owner.</b> The <i>halakha</i> in this case is that the animal’s meat may be eaten but the owner has not fulfilled his obligation with this offering. In such a case, the slaughter of the animal does render its meat fit for consumption. Yet, it is not considered as though the animal has been returned to the owner.

Daf 76b

<b>And Reish Lakish says</b> yet another explanation as to why the principal has not been returned to the owner: This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the thief <b>slaughters blemished</b> animals <b>outside</b> the Temple. A blemished animal may be slaughtered outside the Temple and its meat may be eaten, provided that it is redeemed with money.
<b>Rabbi Elazar wondered about this</b> discussion: <b>According to</b> the explanations attributed to <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> which are based on the assumption that this is referring to slaughtering a sacrificial animal inside the Temple, is it the <b>slaughtering</b> of the animal that <b>renders</b> it <b>permitted</b> for consumption? <b>But isn’t it</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood that <b>renders</b> it <b>permitted?</b> It is prohibited to eat sacrificial meat immediately after the slaughter; only after the sprinkling of the blood is it permitted to consume the meat. As the slaughter itself does not render the animal’s meat permitted, there should be no liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
Rabbi Elazar continues: And <b>according to</b> the explanation of <b>Reish Lakish,</b> who states that the case is referring to the slaughter of a consecrated blemished animal outside the Temple, is it the <b>slaughtering</b> of the animal that <b>renders</b> it <b>permitted</b> for consumption? <b>But isn’t it</b> the <b>redemption</b> of the animal that <b>renders</b> it <b>permitted?</b> Since the thief slaughtered a sacrificial animal, it is prohibited to eat its meat until its sanctity is removed by redeeming it with money. Once again, the slaughter itself does not render the meat permitted, and here too, there should be no liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara comments: Apparently, <b>this</b> following statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon escaped</b> Rabbi Elazar, who asked these questions. Rabbi Shimon holds that <b>any</b> blood <b>that is ready to be sprinkled is considered</b> as though it had already been <b>sprinkled, and</b> likewise, <b>any</b> animal <b>that is ready to be redeemed is considered</b> as if it had already been <b>redeemed.</b>
The Gemara proves that Rabbi Shimon maintains these two opinions. Rabbi Shimon holds that <b>any</b> blood <b>that is ready to be sprinkled is considered</b> as though it had already been <b>sprinkled, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: There are</b> cases involving <b>leftover</b> sacrificial meat <b>after the time allotted for its consumption [<i>notar</i>],</b> in <b>which</b> the meat is susceptible to <b>contracting ritual impurity of food, and there are</b> cases of <b>leftover</b> sacrificial meat in which the meat <b>is not</b> susceptible to <b>contracting ritual impurity of food.</b>
<b>How so?</b> If sacrificial meat was disqualified due to the fact that it <b>remained overnight,</b> i.e., after the allotted time for that offering, <b>before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of its blood, it <b>is not</b> susceptible to <b>contracting ritual impurity of food,</b> as it was never fit for consumption. According to Rabbi Shimon, for an item to be susceptible to contracting ritual impurity of food it must have been permitted for consumption or benefit, either at present or at some point in the past. Sacrificial meat may not be consumed before the sprinkling of its blood, nor may it be consumed if it had been left over after a specific period of time, in most cases overnight. If it was disqualified by being left overnight before its blood had been sprinkled, there was never a time when the meat was permitted. By contrast, if the meat was disqualified by being left over <b>after</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood, it <b>is</b> susceptible to <b>contracting ritual impurity of food,</b> as it was permitted for consumption at some point after the sprinkling of the blood.
<b>And we maintain,</b> as a result of a discussion recorded in tractate <i>Menaḥot</i> (101b): <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Before</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood? It means <b>before</b> the blood <b>became fit for sprinkling.</b> And what is meant by: <b>After</b> the <b>sprinkling</b> of the blood? This means <b>after</b> the blood <b>became fit for sprinkling,</b> i.e., immediately subsequent to the slaughter.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>What is</b> the case in which the meat <b>remained overnight before</b> the blood <b>became fit for sprinkling?</b> Since the blood is fit for sprinkling almost immediately after the animal’s slaughter, how is it possible for the meat to become <i>notar</i> before that stage? The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where there was not enough time in the day to sprinkle</b> the blood, <b>as he slaughtered</b> the offering <b>immediately prior to sunset.</b> The blood was never fit for sprinkling, as the act of sprinkling must be performed before sunset. <b>And</b> in this case the meat is <b>not</b> susceptible to <b>contracting ritual impurity of food,</b> as there was never a time when it was permitted for consumption.
What is the case where the meat <b>remained overnight after</b> the blood <b>became fit for sprinkling?</b> It was <b>when there was</b> enough <b>time</b> remaining <b>in the day</b> after the slaughter <b>to sprinkle</b> the blood, and therefore the meat <b>is</b> susceptible to <b>contracting ritual impurity of food.</b> The Gemara states its conclusion: <b>Evidently,</b> Rabbi Shimon maintains that <b>any</b> blood <b>that is ready to be sprinkled is considered</b> as though it had already been <b>sprinkled.</b>
<b>And</b> Rabbi Shimon holds that <b>any</b> animal <b>that is ready to be re-deemed is considered</b> as though it is already <b>redeemed, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b>

Daf 77a

The meat of the red <b>heifer is</b> susceptible to <b>contracting ritual impurity of food,</b> despite the fact that it is prohibited to derive benefit from such meat, <b>since it had a time when it was fit</b> for consumption.

Daf 77b

<b>And Reish Lakish says,</b> in explanation of Rabbi Shimon’s statement: <b>Rabbi Shimon would say</b> that the red <b>heifer can be redeemed</b> with money even when it has already been slaughtered <b>upon its pyre,</b> i.e., for the sake of purification. For this reason Rabbi Shimon claimed that the meat had a time when it was fit for consumption, as it can be rendered permitted for consumption through redemption. The Gemara states its conclusion: <b>Evidently,</b> Rabbi Shimon holds that <b>any</b> animal <b>that is ready to be redeemed is considered</b> as though it has already been <b>redeemed.</b>
The Gemara discusses the relative merits of the answers provided by Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish: <b>Granted, Rabbi Yoḥanan did not state</b> an answer <b>in accordance with</b> that of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> i.e., Reish Lakish, that the mishna is referring to a blemished animal, <b>because he wants to interpret the mishna</b> as dealing with all kinds of sacrificial animals, <b>even with unblemished</b> ones. <b>But what is the reason</b> that <b>Reish Lakish did not state</b> an answer <b>in accordance with</b> that of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b>
Reish Lakish could have <b>said to you</b> that the verse states: “If a man steals an ox or a sheep, <b>and slaughters it or sells it”</b> (Exodus 21:37). This verse compares slaughtering to selling, thereby indicating that <b>anywhere that</b> the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>is</b> applicable <b>for</b> the <b>sale</b> of a particular animal <b>it is</b> likewise applicable <b>for</b> its <b>slaughter, and anywhere that</b> the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>is not</b> applicable <b>for</b> the <b>sale</b> of an animal <b>it is not</b> applicable <b>for</b> its <b>slaughter</b> either. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> case of <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>since when one sells sacrificial</b> animals <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>sale,</b> and no fourfold or fivefold payment is incurred, so too, <b>there is no</b> fourfold or fivefold payment for their <b>slaughter.</b>
<b>And</b> these two Sages <b>follow their</b> own lines of <b>reasoning. As it was stated: According to the statement of Rabbi Shimon</b> that an act of slaughter that is not fit for accomplishing its full ritual purpose is not considered an act of slaughter at all and does not entail liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, in the case of a thief who <b>sells</b> a stolen <b>animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>], Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The thief is <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment if he sells the animal rather than slaughters it. <b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> He is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that he is <b>liable,</b> as <b>even though</b> the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>is not</b> applicable <b>for the slaughter</b> of a <i>tereifa</i> according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, as its meat may not be eaten, nevertheless, <b>it is</b> applicable <b>for</b> its <b>sale. And Reish Lakish says</b> that the thief is <b>exempt,</b> as, <b>since</b> the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>is not</b> applicable <b>for</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of a <i>tereifa</i> according to Rabbi Shimon, <b>it is not</b> applicable <b>for</b> its <b>sale</b> either.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> from the following <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>stole</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds,</b> e.g., a sheep-goat hybrid, <b>and slaughtered it,</b> or if he stole <b>a <i>tereifa</i> and sold it, he pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment. What, is it not</b> correct to say that this <i>baraita</i>, which mentions the case of selling a stolen <i>tereifa</i> but not slaughtering it, <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon? Apparently,</b> according to Rabbi Shimon, <b>even though</b> the fourfold or fivefold payment <b>is not</b> applicable <b>for</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>it is</b> nevertheless applicable <b>for</b> its <b>sale.</b>
Reish Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan in response: <b>No;</b> this <i>baraita</i> is not taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon. Rather, it follows the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Shimon and maintain that a thief is liable for the fourfold or fivefold payment for slaughtering an animal even if the act of slaughter does not render its meat fit for consumption, as in the case of a <i>tereifa</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> reflects the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> why does it mention the sale of a <i>tereifa</i> but not its slaughter? According to the opinion of the Rabbis, <b>is</b> the fourfold or fivefold payment applicable <b>for</b> the <b>sale</b> of <b>a <i>tereifa</i></b> while <b>it is not</b> applicable <b>for</b> its <b>slaughter?</b> This is certainly not the case.
The Gemara responds with a counter-question: <b>Rather, what</b> would you say, that the <i>baraita</i> reflects the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon?</b> The same difficulty could be raised in the case of <b>diverse kinds,</b> as the <i>baraita</i> mentions the animal’s slaughter but not its sale: <b>Is</b> the fourfold of fivefold payment applicable <b>for</b> the <b>slaughter</b> of an animal of diverse kinds, while <b>it is not</b> applicable <b>for</b> its <b>sale?</b> There is certainly no difference between slaughtering and selling in this case.
<b>Rather,</b> one cannot make such inferences from the <i>baraita</i>, as it <b>teaches</b> liability with regard to the <b>slaughter</b> of diverse kinds, <b>and the same is true</b> with regard <b>to</b> its <b>sale.</b> If so, one can <b>say</b> the same <b>for</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis as well:</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> liability with regard to the <b>sale</b> of a <i>tereifa</i>, <b>and the same is true</b> with regard <b>to</b> its <b>slaughter.</b> Once the <i>baraita</i> is interpreted in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis and not that of Rabbi Shimon, it has no bearing on the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could <b>say to you: What</b> is <b>this</b> comparison? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> reflects the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> and that is why it referred specifically to the sale of a <i>tereifa</i>, the <i>baraita</i> can be explained: <b>Since it</b> necessarily <b>taught</b> the case of <b><i>tereifa</i> in</b> only <b>one</b> manner, that of selling, it maintained the same style of presentation and <b>taught</b> the case of <b>diverse kinds in</b> only <b>one</b> manner, that of slaughtering.
<b>But if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> there is no reason for it to present just one scenario in either case. Rather, <b>let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>combine them and teach them</b> in a single sentence: <b>If one stole</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds or a <i>tereifa</i></b> and then <b>slaughtered or sold</b> either one of <b>them, he pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> The Gemara concludes: This is <b>difficult</b> according to the opinion of Reish Lakish.
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches that a thief is liable to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment in the case of an animal of <b>diverse kinds.</b> The Gemara asks: It is <b>written</b> in the Torah: “If a man steals an ox or <b>a sheep [<i>seh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:37), <b>and Rava says,</b> concerning the verse: “These are the animals that you may eat: The ox, the <i>seh</i> of a sheep, and the <i>seh</i> of a goat” (Deuteronomy 14:4), that <b>this</b> verse <b>establishes a paradigm</b> for other cases: <b>Wherever</b> the word <b><i>seh</i> is stated</b> in the Torah, <b>it</b> serves <b>to exclude only</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds.</b> The Hebrew word <i>seh</i> denotes either a sheep or a goat. A hybrid, which is neither a sheep nor a goat, does not qualify as a <i>seh</i>. Why, then, is the fourfold or fivefold payment applicable to one who stole this kind of animal?
The Gemara answers: <b>It is different here,</b> in the case of the fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>as the verse states “or”</b> (Exodus 21:37), a term that could have been avoided, as explained earlier (67b). This extra word serves <b>to include</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds,</b> i.e., the sheep-goat hybrid.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>every</b> instance of the word <b>“or”</b> serve <b>to include</b> diverse kinds? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: It is written: “When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall be seven days under its mother and from the eighth day onward it may be accepted as a fire-offering to the Lord” (Leviticus 22:27). The phrase <b>“a bull or a sheep”</b> serves to <b>exclude diverse kinds,</b> i.e., an animal of diverse kinds may not be brought as an offering. The phrase <b>“or a goat”</b> serves to <b>exclude</b> an animal that <b>resembles</b> another, i.e., a sheep that is the offspring of two sheep but that looks like a goat, or vice versa.
<b>Rava said</b> in response: The derivation from the word “or” depends on the verse in question. <b>Here,</b> it is interpreted <b>based on the context of the verse, and there,</b> it is also interpreted <b>based on the context of the verse. Here, with regard to theft,</b> the reason the word “or” serves as an inclusion is <b>that it is written: “An ox or a sheep,”</b> which are two animals <b>from which you cannot produce diverse kinds,</b> as they cannot procreate together, and therefore the word <b>“or”</b> serves <b>to include</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds.</b> By contrast, <b>with regard to sacrificial</b> animals, the reason the word “or” serves as an exclusion is <b>that it is written “sheep” and “goat,”</b> which are two animals <b>from which you can produce diverse kinds.</b> Consequently, the word <b>“or”</b> serves <b>to exclude</b> diverse kinds.

Daf 78a

The Gemara asks: <b>But with regard to sacrificial</b> animals <b>it is also stated</b> in the first part of the verse: <b>“A bull or a sheep”</b> (Leviticus 22:27), which are two animals <b>from which you cannot produce diverse kinds. And</b> accordingly, <b>let us include</b> an animal of diverse kinds as being fit for sacrifice on the altar on that account. The Gemara answers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the verse: “Or a goat,” serves <b>to exclude</b> a type of animal from being fit for sacrifice on the altar, it may be inferred that the <b>first clause:</b> “A bull or a sheep,” also serves <b>to exclude</b> a type of animal from being fit for sacrifice on the altar. The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary,</b> one could equally argue that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the first clause</b> of the verse serves <b>to include</b> a type of animal as being fit for sacrifice on the altar, the <b>latter clause also</b> serves <b>to include</b> a type of animal as being fit for sacrifice on the altar.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>What</b> is <b>this</b> comparison? <b>Granted, if you say</b> that both expressions serve <b>to exclude</b> types of animals from being fit for sacrifice on the altar, <b>this is</b> why <b>two exclusions were necessary:</b> One exclusion is referring to diverse kinds and the other is referring to an animal that resembles another species, <b>as even though</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds is excluded, it was</b> still <b>necessary to exclude</b> an animal that <b>resembles</b> another. <b>But if you say</b> that both phrases serve <b>to include</b> types of animals as being fit for sacrifice on the altar, <b>why are two inclusions</b> required? <b>Now that</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds has been included,</b> in the first inclusion, is it <b>necessary</b> to say that an animal that <b>resembles</b> another is also included? There is more justification for including an animal that resembles another, whose parentage is entirely of one species, than for including an animal of diverse kinds.
The Gemara has established that when the Torah uses the word <i>seh</i> (Exodus 21:37) in the context of theft it does not serve to exclude animals of diverse kinds. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> what is meant by <b>this</b> statement <b>that Rava says</b> with regard to the verse: “The ox, the <i>seh</i> of a sheep, and the <i>seh</i> of a goat” (Deuteronomy 14:4), that <b>this establishes a paradigm</b> for other cases, teaching that <b>wherever</b> the word <b><i>seh</i> is stated</b> in the Torah, <b>it</b> serves <b>to exclude only</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds. With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> did Rava state this principle? <b>If</b> this principle is referring <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>sacrificial</b> animals, <b>it is written explicitly with regard to them: “A bull or a sheep”</b> (Leviticus 22:27), which, as taught in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>, serves to <b>exclude diverse kinds.</b>
<b>If</b> this principle is referring <b>to</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>animal tithe,</b> concerning which it is written: “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock [<i>tzon</i>], any one that passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32), this principle is not necessary either. The reason is that the exclusion of diverse kinds can be <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy <b>from</b> the term <b>“under”</b> in this verse, and the word <b>“under”</b> in a verse that deals with <b>sacrificial</b> animals: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat is born, it shall be seven days under its mother” (Leviticus 22:27). This verbal analogy, from which many <i>halakhot</i> of animal tithe are derived, indicates that diverse kinds are not subject to animal tithe, just as they cannot be used for an offering.
<b>If</b> this principle is referring <b>to firstborn</b> animals, concerning which it is written: “However, the firstborn among animals, which is born as a firstling to the Lord, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or <i>seh</i>, it is the Lord’s” (Leviticus 27:26), it is not necessary in that context either. The reason is that this can be <b>derived</b> by a verbal analogy between the term <b>passing,</b> in the verse: “And you shall cause to pass to the Lord all that open the womb” (Exodus 13:12), and the same term <b>passing, from</b> a verse concerning <b>animal tithe:</b> “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, any one that passes under the rod, the tenth shall be sacred unto the Lord” (Leviticus 27:32). This verbal analogy teaches that if the firstborn of a ewe or a she-goat is an animal of diverse kinds it is not considered a firstborn with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of firstborn animals, which means that Rava’s principle is not necessary here.
<b>Alternatively, you</b> must <b>say</b> that an animal that <b>resembles</b> another is <b>not</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of a firstborn, <b>as it is written: “But the firstborn of a bull,</b> or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy” (Numbers 18:17). This indicates that the <i>halakhot</i> of the firstborn are not applicable <b>unless</b> the fathering animal <b>is a bull</b> and <b>its firstborn is also a bull.</b> This excludes an animal that resembles another species, rather than its father. Once it is established that an animal that resembles another is not subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of a firstborn, is it <b>necessary</b> for the Torah to state the same with regard to <b>diverse kinds?</b> Since it is evident that firstborn status does not apply to diverse kinds, Rava’s principle is not required here either.
<b>Rather, Rava’s</b> principle <b>was stated with regard to</b> the redemption of <b>a firstborn donkey,</b> concerning which it is written: “And every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a <i>seh</i>” (Exodus 13:13), <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 12a): <b>One may not redeem</b> a firstborn donkey <b>neither with a calf, nor with a non-domesticated animal, nor with a slaughtered</b> animal, <b>nor with a <i>tereifa</i></b> animal, <b>nor with diverse kinds,</b> i.e., a sheep-goat hybrid, <b>nor with a <i>koy</i>.</b> Rava’s principle is referring to the source for the prohibition against using an animal of diverse kinds for the redemption of a firstborn donkey.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> what about <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, who</b> disagrees with this ruling and <b>permits</b> the use <b>of</b> an animal of <b>diverse kinds</b> for the redemption of a firstborn donkey? <b>As we learned</b> in the same mishna: <b>Rabbi Elazar permits diverse kinds</b> for use in the redemption of a firstborn donkey <b>because it is</b> considered <b>a <i>seh</i>.</b> Accordingly, <b>with regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is Rava’s principle relevant?
<b>Rabbi Elazar</b> could have <b>said to you: Rava’s</b> principle <b>was stated with regard to a non-kosher</b> animal <b>that was born from a kosher</b> mother, <b>whose impregnation was from a non-kosher</b> animal. Rava is saying that this animal is not kosher. <b>And</b> this is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua, as, if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua,</b> although he would agree with this <i>halakha</i>, <b>he derives</b> this <i>halakha</i> (see <i>Bekhorot</i> 7a) <b>from</b> the phrase: <b>“The <i>seh</i> of sheep [<i>kevasim</i>], and the <i>seh</i> of goats [<i>izzim</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:4). The plural forms “<i>kevasim</i>” and “<i>izzim</i>” indicate that a lamb is not kosher <b>unless</b> both <b>its father is a sheep and its mother is a ewe,</b> and the same <i>halakha</i> applies to a kid.
The Gemara asks with regard to the case under discussion: <b>But can a kosher</b> animal <b>become impregnated by a non-kosher</b> animal in the first place? Is it even possible for this to occur? Why did Rabbi Yehoshua and Rava have to find a biblical source to deem this offspring as non-kosher? The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> it is possible. <b>As we maintain</b> elsewhere (<i>Bekhorot</i> 7a)

Daf 78b

<b>that</b> the mother animal <b>became impregnated from</b> an animal with <b>non-cloven</b> hooves that was born from a kosher mother and father. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who maintains that the offspring resulting from this, which does not have cloven hooves, is not kosher. Since the animal’s father is not kosher according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, the offspring is also not kosher, in accordance with Rava’s principle.
<b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to one who says: <b>It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt</b>-<b>offering, and he</b> subsequently <b>set aside a bull</b> for this purpose, <b>and another</b> person <b>came and stole</b> the bull, <b>can the thief exempt himself</b> from liability <b>by</b> repaying the owner with <b>a sheep, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, or by</b> repaying him with a bird to be used as <b>a bird burnt-offering, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya?</b> This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Menaḥot</i> 107a): If one says: <b>It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt</b>-<b>offering, he must bring</b> a bull or <b>a sheep</b> as a burnt-offering to fulfill his vow. <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: He may</b> even <b>bring a turtledove or a young pigeon</b> as a burnt-offering.
Rava elaborates: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case? <b>Do we say</b> that he <b>accepted upon himself</b> to sacrifice an animal with the <b>status of a burnt-offering,</b> in which case any animal that fulfills this requirement will suffice? If so, the thief may compensate the owner with a sheep or bird, as the owner can sacrifice that animal as a burnt-offering. <b>Or perhaps</b> the owner <b>can say to</b> the thief: <b>I want to perform</b> the <b>mitzva</b> in <b>the optimal manner,</b> which is by sacrificing a bull. Therefore, you must pay me back with a bull.
<b>After he raised the dilemma,</b> Rava himself <b>subsequently resolved it:</b> The <b>thief can exempt himself</b> from liability by repaying the owner <b>with a sheep, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> or <b>by</b> repaying him with a bird to be used as <b>a bird burnt-offering, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>explicitly,</b> i.e., without the question-and-answer format: <b>Rava says:</b> With regard to one who says: <b>It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a burnt</b>-<b>offering, and he</b> subsequently <b>set aside a bull</b> for this purpose, <b>and another</b> person <b>came and stole</b> the bull, the thief can <b>exempt himself</b> from liability <b>by</b> repaying the owner with <b>a sheep, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, or by</b> repaying him with a bird to be used as <b>a bird burnt-offering, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a thief <b>sold</b> a stolen animal in a partial fashion, e.g., <b>except for</b> one <b>one-hundredth of it,</b> which he kept for himself; <b>or</b> if <b>he had a partnership in</b> owning the animal before stealing it; or in the case of a thief <b>who slaughtered</b> the stolen animal <b>and it became non-kosher</b> meat <b>in his hand</b> because he slaughtered it improperly; or in the case of a thief <b>who ripped open</b> the animal rather than slaughtering it halakhically; <b>or</b> in the case of a thief <b>who tore loose</b> the gullet or windpipe of the animal as he slaughtered it, rendering the slaughter invalid, in all these cases <b>he pays</b> the <b>double payment but does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> The fourfold or five-fold payment applies only if the animal is entirely sold or if it is slaughtered in accordance with the halakhic definition of animal slaughter.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> does the mishna mean when it states that the thief sold the animal <b>except for</b> one <b>one-hundredth of it?</b> Which part of the animal must the thief keep for himself for him to be exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment? <b>Rav says:</b> The mishna means that he sold it <b>except for some</b> part of the animal <b>that becomes permitted through</b> its <b>slaughter.</b> This does not apply to horns or a sheep’s fleece, which do not require slaughter in order to be used. <b>And Levi says:</b> The mishna’s statement applies even if the thief sold the entire animal <b>except for its fleece. And it is likewise taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> The thief is exempt even if he sells the whole animal <b>except for its fleece.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav from a <i>baraita</i>: If the thief <b>sold</b> the whole animal <b>except for its foreleg,</b> or <b>except for its hind leg,</b> or <b>except for its horn,</b> or <b>except for its fleece, he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> If the thief sells the animal except for some <b>part</b> of it whose absence <b>invalidates</b> its <b>slaughter, he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi continues: <b>But</b> if he leaves out from the sale a part of the animal whose absence <b>does not invalidate the slaughter, he pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> If an animal is missing one of its vital organs, e.g., its liver, one of its intestines, its gullet, or its windpipe, it is considered already dead and its slaughter at this stage would be invalid. For the thief to be exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment on the grounds of an incomplete sale, he must retain one of these organs for himself.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If the thief sells the whole animal <b>except for its horn, he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> If he sells the whole animal <b>except for its fleece, he does pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
The Gemara explains the objection from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Levi</b> this <i>baraita</i> does not present a difficulty, as his ruling is exactly <b>like</b> that of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>. But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav</b> it does present a difficulty, as in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion does his ruling accord? None of the three opinions expressed in the <i>baraita</i> correlate with that of Rav.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>Rav says</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If the thief <b>sold</b> the entire animal <b>except for its foreleg or except for its hind leg, he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> If he sold the entire animal <b>except for its horn</b> or <b>except for its fleece, he does pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the four opinions of the <i>tanna’im</i> presented in these <i>baraitot</i>. <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree? The first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that when the Torah states: “If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and slaughters it or sells it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep” (Exodus 21:37), the term <b>“and slaughters it”</b> indicates that <b>we require</b> him to slaughter <b>all of it</b> for him to incur liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. Likewise, the term <b>“or sells it”</b> teaches that <b>we require</b> him to sell <b>all of it,</b> not leaving any portion at all for himself, even the fleece.
<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that the term <b>“and slaughters it”</b> is referring to <b>parts</b> of the animal <b>that are</b> affected <b>by</b> its <b>slaughter,</b> which serves <b>to exclude parts</b> of the animal <b>that are not</b> affected <b>by</b> its <b>slaughter.</b> When the Torah immediately adds the term <b>“or sells it,”</b> this indicates that selling is <b>similar to slaughter.</b> Consequently, if the sale excludes the animal’s fleece or horns, i.e., those parts that are not affected by slaughter, there is still fourfold or fivefold payment.
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar holds,</b> according to the first version of his opinion, that <b>the</b> animal’s <b>horn, which is not meant to be cut off</b> in the animal’s lifetime, <b>is</b> considered a significant <b>withholding</b> if the thief keeps that part for himself, <b>and he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> By contrast, <b>fleece, which is meant to be cut off</b> in the animal’s lifetime, <b>is not</b> considered a significant <b>withholding</b> if the thief keeps it for himself, <b>and</b> therefore <b>he must pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
<b>And the other <i>tanna</i> of the school of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar holds</b> that the animal’s <b>forelegs and hind legs, which require slaughter</b> for them to be put to their usual use, i.e., for eating, <b>are</b> considered a significant <b>withholding</b> if the thief keeps one of them for himself, <b>and</b> consequently <b>he does not pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> By contrast, <b>its horns and its fleece, which do not require slaughter</b> in order to be used, <b>are not</b> considered a significant <b>withholding</b> if the thief keeps them for himself.
The Gemara asks: This presents <b>a difficulty,</b> as there is a contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar and</b> another opinion presented in the name <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.</b> The Gemara answers: The two rulings represent the reports of <b>two <i>tanna’im</i>, and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who steals</b> an animal that is <b>missing a limb, or</b> that is <b>lame, or</b> that is <b>blind,</b> and he subsequently sold it, <b>and similarly, one who steals an animal</b> belonging to several <b>partners</b> and he subsequently sold it, is <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>But</b> several <b>partners who stole</b> an animal together and sell it are <b>exempt</b> from the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> to the contrary, that several <b>partners who stole</b> an animal together and sell it are <b>liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment?
The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that this is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> states that he is exempt, it is referring <b>to</b> one <b>partner who stole</b> an animal <b>from another</b> partner. <b>There,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> states that he is liable, it is dealing <b>with a partner, who,</b> together with other thieves, <b>stole</b> an animal <b>from</b> someone else <b>outside</b> their group.
<b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>a partner who stole</b> an animal <b>from another</b> partner and slaughtered it, <b>and</b> likewise <b>partners who</b> jointly <b>stole</b> an animal and one of them slaughtered it, <b>should be liable</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. To counter this, <b>the verse states: “And slaughters it,”</b> which indicates that <b>we require</b> liability for slaughtering <b>all of it, and</b> in these cases <b>it is not</b> so. One who steals an animal that he partly owns is not liable for slaughtering his own portion. Likewise, when several partners steal an animal, the one who slaughters it is not liable for slaughtering the portions of his fellow thieves.
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said</b> a different resolution of the contradiction: This is <b>not difficult.</b> Both <i>baraitot</i> are speaking of partners who together stole an animal from someone else. <b>Here,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> states that the thief is liable, it is referring <b>to a partner who slaughtered</b> the animal <b>with the knowledge</b> and consent <b>of another</b> partner. In such a case the one slaughtering is acting as the agent of the partner as well and is fully liable for the slaughter. <b>There,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> states that the thief is exempt, it is speaking <b>of a partner who slaughtered</b> the animal <b>without the knowledge of another</b> partner in the theft. Consequently, the one slaughtering is acting solely on his own and is not liable for the slaughter of his partner’s share, which is why he is exempt from any payment.
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises</b> several <b>dilemmas:</b> If the thief <b>sold</b> the animal <b>except for thirty days,</b> i.e., the thief reserved the right to use the animal himself for thirty days before the sale takes effect, what is the <i>halakha</i>? If he sold it <b>except for its work,</b> i.e., he stipulated with the buyer that any work the animal performs would be for the thief’s own benefit and profit, what is the <i>halakha</i>? If he stole a pregnant animal and sold it <b>except for its fetus, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara elaborates on the last dilemma: <b>According to the one who says that a fetus is</b> considered as <b>its mother’s thigh,</b> i.e., a part of its mother, <b>you should not raise the dilemma, as</b> it is clear that the thief, by retaining the fetus, <b>has withheld</b> part <b>of</b> the animal. <b>When you should raise the dilemma,</b> it is <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the one who says that a fetus is not</b> considered as <b>its mother’s thigh,</b> i.e., it has the status of an independent being. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case? <b>Do we say that since it is</b> in fact <b>attached</b> to the mother, if the thief keeps the fetus for himself <b>it is</b> considered a significant <b>withholding? Or perhaps, since it stands to become detached from</b> the mother <b>it is not</b> considered a significant <b>withholding?</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who state</b> a different analysis of this dilemma: <b>Since</b> a fetus is <b>not</b> considered as <b>its mother’s thigh, it is not</b> considered a significant <b>withholding, or perhaps, since</b> it needs its mother <b>to be rendered permitted</b> for consumption <b>through</b> the mother’s <b>slaughter, it is considered as though</b> the thief <b>has withheld a part of the</b> mother’s <b>body.</b> The Gemara concludes: All these dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>stole</b> an animal, <b>severed</b> one of its limbs, <b>and</b> then <b>sold it, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that the essential factor is that part of <b>what he stole he has not sold,</b> as the missing limb was not sold, and therefore he is exempt from the fourfold or fivefold payment? <b>Or perhaps</b> the essential factor is that with regard to that <b>which he sold he has not withheld</b> any part for himself. Once again, the Gemara states that this dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and gave it to another and</b> that person <b>slaughtered it</b> for him, or if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and gave it to another and</b> that person <b>sold it</b> for him, the thief is liable to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, as performing these actions through an agent is equivalent to performing them by oneself.

Daf 79a

The <i>baraita</i> continues: If <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and consecrated</b> it, or if he <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and sold</b> it <b>on credit,</b> i.e., without receiving any money for it at the time, or if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and exchanged</b> it for another item, or if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and gave it</b> to another <b>as a gift,</b> or if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and</b> used it to <b>repay his debt,</b> or if <b>he stole</b> an animal and used it to <b>pay</b> for an item <b>he</b> purchased on <b>credit,</b> or if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and sent it in</b> the form of <b>presents</b> to his betrothed <b>in his father-in-law’s house,</b> in all of these cases <b>he pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment,</b> as these acts are all considered forms of selling. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaching us?</b> All of the <i>halakhot</i> it states are obvious. The Gemara answers: <b>The first clause teaches us,</b> through the case of one who <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and gave it to another and</b> that person <b>slaughtered</b> or sold it on his behalf, <b>that</b> in this case <b>there is agency for transgression. Even though in the entire Torah</b> there is a principle that <b>there is no agency for transgression, here there is agency for transgression.</b> The Torah’s principle is that a transgression committed by an agent who was appointed by another person is not considered the act of the one who appointed the agent, but the independent act of the agent himself. The case discussed by this <i>baraita</i> is an exception to the rule, as here, the agent’s slaughter or sale of the animal is legally considered the action of the thief.
<b>What</b> is <b>the reason</b> that this case is an exception to the principle? It is because the verse states: <b>“And slaughters it or sells it”</b> (Exodus 21:37), which juxtaposes the two acts of slaughtering and selling. This teaches that <b>just as</b> one becomes liable for <b>selling, which</b> by definition <b>is impossible without another</b> party, i.e., the buyer, <b>so too one becomes liable</b> for <b>slaughtering</b> even when it is <b>by means of another</b> party, i.e., when the thief instructs another person to slaughter the animal on his behalf.
<b>And the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> a novelty in the case of one who <b>stole</b> an animal <b>and consecrated</b> it. The novelty is that this is considered a sale despite the fact that there is no purchaser. This is due to the following argument: <b>What</b> difference <b>is it to me</b> if <b>he sold</b> the animal <b>to an ordinary</b> person, and <b>what</b> difference <b>is it to me</b> if <b>he sold it to Heaven</b> by consecrating it? If the animal changes ownership, it is considered a sale, and it does not matter if the new owner is an ordinary person or the Temple treasury.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>stole</b> an animal <b>in</b> its <b>owner’s domain,</b> i.e., he took hold of it or established control over it but had not yet removed it from the owner’s premises, <b>and</b> then <b>he slaughtered</b> it <b>or sold</b> it <b>outside</b> of the owner’s <b>domain; or</b> if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>outside</b> of the owner’s <b>domain and slaughtered</b> it <b>or sold</b> it <b>in</b> the owner’s <b>domain; or</b> if <b>he stole</b> an animal <b>and slaughtered</b> it <b>or sold</b> it, and all of this occurred <b>outside</b> the owner’s <b>domain,</b> in all of these cases, <b>he must pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment. But</b> if <b>he stole</b> it <b>and slaughtered or sold</b> it, and all of this occurred <b>in</b> the owner’s <b>domain,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from any of the fines for theft, as it is not considered theft until the stolen object is actually removed from the owner’s premises.
If the thief <b>was</b> in the process of <b>leading</b> the animal <b>and leaving</b> the owner’s premises, <b>and it died</b> while it was still <b>in the owner’s domain,</b> the thief is <b>exempt</b> from all fines. If <b>he lifted it up or led it out of</b> the <b>owner’s domain and</b> then the animal <b>died,</b> he is <b>liable</b> for his theft. For an act to be considered theft, the thief must acquire the item by pulling it or moving it, which are ineffective forms of acquisition on the owner’s premises; or by lifting it up, which is effective even when performed in the owner’s domain.
If the thief <b>gave</b> the animal as payment <b>for the redemption of his firstborn son, or</b> as payment <b>to a creditor,</b> or conveyed it for safeguarding <b>to an unpaid bailee,</b> or lent it <b>to a borrower,</b> or conveyed it for safeguarding <b>to a paid bailee, or</b> leased it <b>to a renter, and he was leading out</b> the animal <b>and it died in the owner’s domain,</b> the thief is <b>exempt</b> from all fines. If that individual, following the thief’s instructions, <b>lifted up</b> the animal <b>or led it out of the owner’s domain, and it</b> subsequently <b>died,</b> the thief is <b>liable</b> for the theft. The thief is liable for instructing another to remove the animal for the purposes of payment of a debt, safekeeping, borrowing, or rental, as this is tantamount to the thief taking it with his own hands.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ameimar raises a dilemma:</b> Did the Sages <b>institute</b> the requirement of <b>pulling</b> or leading an animal <b>with regard to bailees, or not?</b> When an animal or other item is purchased, the parties to the sale are not bound by the deal until the purchaser performs an act of acquisition, one of which is pulling the animal or leads it along. Did the Sages institute an ordinance that the same applies to bailees? In other words, does the bailee’s obligation to safeguard the animal or item begin as soon as he consents to watch it, or only after he has taken the animal and moved it even minimally?
<b>Rav Yeimar said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: If the thief <b>gave</b> the animal as payment <b>for the redemption of his firstborn son, or</b> as payment <b>to a creditor,</b> or conveyed it for safeguarding <b>to an unpaid bailee,</b> or lent it <b>to a borrower,</b> or conveyed it for safeguarding <b>to a paid bailee, or</b> rented it <b>to a renter, and he was leading out</b> the animal <b>and it died in the owner’s domain,</b> the thief is <b>exempt</b> from payment. <b>What, is it not</b> talking about the <b>bailee</b> leading out the animal, when it states that the thief is exempt? <b>And</b> if so, <b>conclude from</b> this mishna that the Sages <b>instituted</b> the requirement of <b>pulling with regard to bailees.</b> If the bailee’s obligation begins immediately upon his consent to watch over the item, it would be considered stolen by the thief at that stage, even before the bailee moves it.
Ameimar <b>said to</b> Rav Yeimar: <b>No,</b> this is not necessarily the correct interpretation of the mishna. The mishna may mean that the owner gave the animal to his creditor or to a bailee, and subsequently a thief came to steal it from the house of the creditor or the bailee, and it was the <b>thief</b> who was leading the animal out of those premises when it died.
Rav Yeimar asked: How can that clause of the mishna refer to an animal that died as the thief was leading it out? The mishna already <b>taught this</b> <i>halakha</i> in <b>the first clause.</b> Ameimar answered: Nevertheless, it is possible that the mishna <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a thief who stole</b> an animal <b>from its owner’s house, and</b> then <b>taught</b> it again with regard to <b>a thief who stole</b> an animal <b>from a bailee’s house.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said to</b> Ameimar: <b>Do not reject</b> Rav Yeimar’s argument by means of this alternative interpretation of the mishna. It is not reasonable to assert that the mishna taught this <i>halakha</i> twice, as <b>what</b> difference <b>is</b> it <b>to me</b> if the <b>thief stole</b> it <b>from the bailee’s house</b> and <b>what</b> difference <b>is</b> it <b>to me if</b> the <b>thief stole</b> it <b>from the owner’s house?</b> There is no halakhic distinction between these two cases. Therefore, the mishna would not have discussed both of them.
<b>Rather, is it not</b> more reasonable to say that the mishna should be interpreted as meaning that the <b>bailee</b> was leading the animal out of the owner’s house at the behest of the thief, as Rav Yeimar claimed? <b>And</b> therefore, one should <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that the Sages <b>instituted</b> the requirement of <b>pulling with regard to bailees.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that they did. <b>It was also stated</b> explicitly that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Just as</b> the Sages <b>instituted</b> the requirement of <b>pulling with regard to purchasers, so too</b> they <b>instituted</b> the requirement of <b>pulling with regard to bailees.</b>
<b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as</b> the Sages <b>instituted</b> the requirement of <b>pulling with regard to purchasers, so too</b> they <b>instituted</b> the requirement of <b>pulling with regard to bailees. And just as land is acquired by</b> the payment of <b>money, by</b> the writing of <b>a deed</b> of sale, <b>or by</b> the purchaser <b>taking possession</b> of the land through working it, <b>so too a rental</b> deal is finalized <b>by</b> the payment of <b>money, by</b> the writing of <b>a deed</b> of rent, <b>or by</b> the renter <b>taking possession</b> of the land. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara asks: When the <i>baraita</i> speaks of rental, it is referring to <b>rental of what</b> kind of property? <b>If we say</b>

Daf 79b

it is speaking of <b>the rental of movable property, is movable property</b> subject to the writing of <b>a deed?</b> Rather, <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It is referring to <b>the rental of land.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> If people <b>saw</b> a thief <b>who was hiding in the woods</b> near a herd of grazing animals, <b>and</b> that individual emerged and <b>slaughtered or sold</b> one of the animals from the herd, <b>he pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is the thief liable to the fourfold or fivefold payment? <b>But he did not pull</b> the animal. Rabbi Elazar is apparently describing a case where the thief emerged from the forest and slaughtered one of the animals without first moving it, and there is no fourfold or fivefold payment unless the thief first steals the animal. <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where he hit</b> the animal <b>with a stick,</b> causing it to move.
With regard to Rabbi Elazar’s statement, the Sages <b>say: But since</b> people <b>saw him</b> doing all this, <b>he is a robber,</b> not a thief, and the fourfold or fivefold payment applies only to thieves. A thief is one who sneaks into a house or other private property; one who commits his act brazenly, in public, is classified as a robber. The Gemara answers: <b>Since he was hiding from them, he is</b> considered <b>a thief,</b> despite the fact that they saw him.
The Gemara asks: <b>But if so, what are the circumstances</b> of a <b>robber? Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> Robbers are <b>like</b> the case of <b>Benaiah ben Jehoiada, as it is stated</b> concerning him: “He slew an Egyptian, a goodly man; and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, <b>and he robbed the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear”</b> (II Samuel 23:21).
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> A different example of a robber is a case <b>like</b> that of <b>the men of Shechem, as it is stated: “And the men of Shechem set ambushers for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them”</b> (Judges 9:25).
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rabbi Abbahu did not say</b> the example <b>from this</b> verse, which discusses the men of Shechem? He could have <b>said to you: Since</b> the men of Shechem <b>were hiding</b> in ambush, <b>they are not</b> considered <b>robbers</b> but thieves. <b>And</b> how would <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> respond to this claim? <b>This</b> fact <b>that they were hiding</b> was not because they were hesitant to steal in view of the public. Rather, they acted in this manner <b>so that</b> the travelers <b>should not see them</b> in advance <b>and flee from them.</b>
§ The Gemara concludes its discussion of theft with several aggadic statements. <b>His students asked Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: For what reason was the Torah stricter with a thief than with a robber?</b> Only a thief is required to pay the double, fourfold, or fivefold payment, not a robber. Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to them</b> in response: <b>This one,</b> the robber, <b>equated the honor of</b> the <b>servant to the honor of his Master, and that one,</b> the thief, <b>did not equate the honor of</b> the <b>servant to the honor of his Master.</b> The robber fears neither God nor people, as he is not afraid to rob in public. The thief does not fear God but he does fear other people, which demonstrates that he is more concerned about humans than God.
<b>As it were,</b> the thief <b>establishes the eye below,</b> i.e., God’s eye, <b>as though it does not see, and the ear below,</b> i.e., God’s ear, <b>as though it does not hear.</b> The Gemara cites verses that describe people who imagine that God does not see their actions, <b>as it is stated: “Woe to them who seek deeply to hide their counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the dark,</b> and they say: Who sees us, and who knows us?” (Isaiah 29:15). <b>And it is written: “And they say: The Lord will not see, neither will the God of Jacob give heed”</b> (Psalms 94:7). <b>And it is written: “For they say: The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see”</b> (Ezekiel 9:9).
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir said:</b> To illustrate the severity of a thief over a robber, as per Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s explanation, <b>they stated a parable in the name of Rabban Gamliel. To what is this matter comparable? To two people who were</b> living <b>in the</b> same <b>city, and</b> both of them <b>prepared a feast. One</b> of them <b>invited the people of the city</b> to his feast <b>but he did not invite the king’s sons. And</b> the other <b>did not invite the people of the city and</b> also <b>did not invite the king’s sons. Which of them</b> deserves <b>a greater punishment? You must say</b> that it is <b>this one who invited the people of the city but did not invite the king’s sons.</b> Likewise, both the thief and the robber show disdain for God, but the robber does not display more respect for people.
The Gemara discusses why there is a fourfold payment for a sheep but a fivefold payment for an ox. <b>Rabbi Meir said: Come and see how great the power of labor is.</b> The theft of <b>an ox, which</b> was forced <b>by</b> the thief <b>to cease its labor,</b> leads to <b>a fivefold</b> payment; whereas the theft of <b>a sheep, which</b> was <b>not</b> forced <b>by</b> the thief <b>to cease its labor,</b> as a sheep performs no labor, leads to only <b>a fourfold</b> payment.
<b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said: Come and see how great human dignity is.</b> The theft of <b>an ox, which walked on its own legs</b> as the thief stole it, leads to <b>a fivefold</b> payment, whereas the theft of <b>a sheep, which</b> the thief <b>carried on his shoulder</b> as he walked, thereby causing himself embarrassment, leads to only <b>a fourfold</b> payment.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not raise small domesticated animals,</b> i.e., sheep and goats, <b>in</b> settled areas of <b>Eretz Yisrael,</b> as they graze on people’s crops. <b>But one may raise</b> them <b>in Syria,</b> despite the fact that with regard to many other <i>halakhot</i> Syria is treated like Eretz Yisrael, <b>and in the wilderness of Eretz Yisrael.</b>
<b>One may not raise chickens in Jerusalem, due to the sacrificial meat</b> that is common there. There is a concern that chickens will pick up garbage that imparts ritual impurity and bring it into contact with sacrificial meat, thereby rendering it ritually impure. <b>And priests may not</b> raise chickens anywhere <b>in Eretz Yisrael, because of the</b> many foods in a priest’s possession that must be kept <b>ritually pure,</b> e.g., <i>teruma</i>.
Furthermore, <b>one may not raise pigs anywhere,</b> and <b>a person may not raise a dog unless it is tied with chains. One may spread out traps [<i>nishovim</i>] for pigeons only if</b> this was performed <b>at a distance of</b> at least <b>thirty <i>ris</i>,</b> which is 8,000 cubits, <b>from</b> any <b>settled area,</b> to ensure that privately owned pigeons are not caught in the traps.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not raise small domesticated animals,</b> i.e., sheep and goats, <b>in</b> settled areas of <b>Eretz Yisrael. But one may raise</b> them <b>in the forests of Eretz Yisrael. In Syria,</b> it is permitted to do so <b>even in a settled area. And, needless to say,</b> it is permitted to do so <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not raise small domesticated animals in</b> settled areas of <b>Eretz Yisrael. But one may raise</b> them <b>in the wilderness that is in Judea and in the wilderness that is on the border near Akko. And even though</b> the Sages <b>said that one may not raise small domesticated animals, nevertheless, one may raise large, domesticated animals,</b> i.e., cattle, <b>because</b> the Sages <b>issue a decree upon the public only if a majority of the public is able to abide by it.</b>
This difference is that it is <b>possible</b> for someone <b>to bring small domesticated animals from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael in the event that they are needed. But it is <b>not possible</b> for someone <b>to bring large, domesticated animals from outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael whenever he needs one, since there is a constant need for them as beasts of burden. Therefore, the Sages did not issue a decree with regard to these types of animals.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And even though they said that one may not raise small domesticated animals, however, one may keep</b> these animals on his premises for <b>thirty days before a pilgrimage Festival, and thirty days before the</b> wedding <b>feast of one’s son,</b> when many animals are needed for food, <b>provided that he does not leave the last</b> one, i.e., the animal which he purchased immediately before the Festival, for <b>thirty days.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the final line of the <i>baraita</i>: The <i>baraita</i> needs to state this ruling <b>as</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say that if the pilgrimage Festival has passed and thirty days have not yet elapsed from</b> the time <b>when he bought</b> the animal <b>until now,</b> he may keep the animal until thirty days have elapsed. To counter this, the <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>we do not say: It is permitted to keep it for</b> a total of <b>thirty days. Rather, once the pilgrimage Festival has passed, he should not keep it</b> any longer.

Daf 80a

The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And a butcher may buy</b> small domesticated animals <b>and slaughter</b> them, and again <b>buy</b> small domesticated animals <b>and keep</b> them for a while, <b>provided that he does not keep the last one of them</b> that he bought beyond <b>thirty days.</b>
<b>His students asked Rabban Gamliel: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to raising</b> small domesticated animals in Eretz Yisrael? Rabban Gamliel <b>said to them: It is permitted.</b> The Gemara interrupts its citation of the <i>baraita</i> to pose a question: How could Rabban Gamliel say this? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>One may not raise</b> small domesticated animals in Eretz Yisrael?
<b>Rather,</b> the text of the <i>baraita</i> must be emended, and <b>they</b> actually <b>raised this dilemma before him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to keeping</b> them for a while? The Gemara resumes the quotation of the <i>baraita</i>: Rabban Gamliel <b>said to them:</b> It is <b>permitted, provided that</b> the animal <b>does not go out and graze among the flock. Rather,</b> one should <b>tie it to the legs of the bed</b> in his house.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving a certain pious man who was groaning,</b> i.e., suffering, <b>due to</b> a pain in <b>his heart.</b> Those caring for the man <b>asked the physicians</b> what to do for him, <b>and they said: There is no other remedy for him but that he should suckle warm milk every morning. And they brought him a she-goat and tied it to the leg of the bed for him, and he would suckle</b> milk <b>from it every morning.</b>
<b>Days later, his friends came in to visit him. When they saw that she-goat tied to the legs of the bed, they turned back, saying:</b> There is <b>an armed bandit in this</b> man’s <b>house, and we are going in to</b> visit <b>him?</b> They referred to the goat in this manner because small animals habitually graze on the vegetation of others, thereby stealing their crops.
His friends <b>sat down and investigated</b> this pious man’s behavior, <b>and they could not find</b> any sin attributable <b>to him except that sin of</b> keeping <b>that she-goat</b> in his house. That man <b>himself also said at the time of his death: I know</b> for a fact <b>that I have no sin</b> attributable <b>to me except</b> the <b>sin of</b> keeping <b>that she-goat</b> in my house, <b>as I transgressed the statement of my colleagues,</b> the Sages.
<b>Rabbi Yishmael said:</b> The members of my <b>father’s family were among the wealthy property holders in the upper Galilee. And for what reason were they destroyed?</b> It was due to the fact <b>that they would graze</b> flocks <b>in the forests, and</b> also because they would <b>judge</b> cases of <b>monetary law by</b> means of <b>a single</b> judge. <b>And even though there were forests close to their houses,</b> and therefore there should have been no problem for them to take their animals to graze in these forests, <b>there was a small,</b> private <b>field and they would convey</b> the animals on <b>a path through it.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there is <b>a shepherd</b> of small domesticated animals <b>who repented,</b> the court <b>does not obligate him to sell</b> all his animals <b>immediately. Rather, he may sell</b> them <b>gradually. And likewise,</b> in the case of <b>a convert who came into</b> possession of <b>dogs and pigs</b> (see 83a) <b>as</b> part of <b>his inheritance,</b> the court <b>does not obligate him to sell</b> all of them <b>immediately. Rather, he may sell</b> them <b>gradually.</b>
<b>And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>one who vowed to purchase a house or to marry a woman in Eretz Yisrael,</b> the court <b>does not obligate him to acquire</b> the first house or marry the first woman he sees <b>immediately</b> upon his arrival in Eretz Yisrael. Instead, he may wait <b>until he finds</b> the house or wife <b>appropriate for him.</b>
<b>And</b> there was <b>an incident involving a certain</b> unmarried <b>woman who had a son who was distressing her, and she jumped up and took an oath</b> impulsively: <b>Any</b> man <b>who comes</b> to marry me and will discipline my son, <b>I will not turn him away. And unworthy men jumped at</b> the opportunity to marry <b>her. And when the matter came before the Sages, they said:</b> She need not marry one of these men, as <b>this</b> woman’s <b>intention</b> in her oath was certainly <b>to</b> marry <b>only</b> a man <b>who is appropriate for her.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Just as</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one may not raise small domesticated animals,</b> i.e., sheep and goats, <b>so</b> too <b>they said</b> that <b>one may not raise small undomesticated animals. Rabbi Yishmael says: One may raise village dogs, cats, monkeys, and genets, because they serve to clean the house</b> of mice and other vermin.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are</b> these <b>genets? Rav Yehuda said:</b> These are known in Aramaic as <b><i>shartza ḥartza</i>. And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that in Aramaic this animal is called <b><i>ḥarza</i>.</b> This creature <b>has short thighs and it grazes among the thorn bushes. And what</b> is the reason that they are called <b><i>shartza</i>,</b> a term that generally refers to creeping creatures that slither [<i>shoretz</i>] rather than walk? It is <b>because its thighs are</b> so <b>short</b> that it appears to slither instead of walking on legs.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: We in Babylonia have rendered ourselves like</b> the residents of <b>Eretz Yisrael</b> with regard <b>to</b> the prohibition of the Sages against raising <b>small domesticated animals. Rav Adda bar Ahava said to Rav Huna: What of your</b> sheep and goats? How can you raise these animals in Babylonia?
Rav Huna <b>said to him: Ḥova,</b> my wife, <b>watches</b> the animals to ensure that they do not graze on land belonging to others. Rav Adda bar Ahava cursed Rav Huna and <b>said to him: May Ḥova bury her son!</b> In <b>all the years of Rav Adda bar Ahava, no children of Rav Huna from Ḥova survived,</b> due to this curse. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of the above statement: <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: We in Babylonia rendered ourselves like</b> those of <b>Eretz Yisrael</b> with regard <b>to</b> raising <b>small domesticated animals, from</b> the time <b>when Rav came to Babylonia.</b>
§ <b>Rav and Shmuel and Rav Asi</b> once <b>happened to be</b> present <b>at a house</b> where a celebration was being held marking the passage <b>of a week of</b> a newborn <b>son,</b> i.e., a circumcision. <b>And some say it was a house</b> where a celebration was being held marking the <b>redemption of</b> a firstborn <b>son. Rav</b> would <b>not enter before Shmuel,</b> for reasons the Gemara will explain;

Daf 80b

<b>Shmuel would not enter before Rav Asi,</b> as he considered Rav Asi to be greater than he; and <b>Rav Asi would not enter before Rav,</b> as Rav was his teacher. <b>They said: Which</b> of us <b>should stay behind</b> and let the other two come in before him? They decided: <b>Let Shmuel stay behind, and let Rav and Rav Asi come</b> inside in that order. Afterward, Shmuel himself would enter.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why didn’t they decide to <b>let Rav or Rav Asi stay behind?</b> The Gemara explains: It was <b>a mere gesture that Rav performed for Shmuel</b> in initially stating that Shmuel should precede him, as Rav did not really feel that Shmuel was superior to him. Rather, <b>on account of that incident</b> in <b>which</b> he inadvertently <b>cursed</b> Shmuel, <b>Rav took upon himself</b> to treat Shmuel with deference.
<b>In the meantime,</b> while all this was going on, <b>a cat [<i>shunara</i>] came and severed the hand of the baby. Rav emerged</b> from the house <b>and taught:</b> With regard to <b>a cat, it is permitted to kill it</b> even if it is privately owned; <b>and it is prohibited to maintain it</b> in one’s possession; <b>and it is not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>theft</b> if one takes it from its owner; <b>and,</b> in the case of a lost cat, <b>it is not subject to</b> the obligation of <b>returning a lost item to its owner.</b>
The Gemara asks a question with regard to Rav’s statement: <b>And since you said</b> that <b>it is permitted to kill it, what is</b> the need to state <b>further</b> that <b>it is prohibited to maintain it</b> in one’s possession? If a cat is considered such a dangerous animal that it is permitted to kill it, of course one cannot keep it in his possession. The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that although Rav ruled that <b>it is permitted to kill it,</b> he concedes that <b>there is no prohibition</b> in keeping it, Rav therefore <b>teaches us</b> that it is also prohibited to keep it in one’s possession.
The Sages <b>say,</b> further questioning Rav’s statement: <b>And since you said</b> that <b>it is not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>theft</b> if one takes it from its owner, <b>what is</b> the need to state <b>further</b> that <b>it is not subject to</b> the obligation of <b>returning a lost item to its owner</b> in the case of a lost cat? If one may actively steal a cat, certainly there is no obligation to return it when found. <b>Ravina said</b> in response: Rav was referring <b>to its hide.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> against Rav’s ruling that it is prohibited to keep a cat. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: One may raise village dogs, cats, monkeys, and genets, because they serve to clean the house</b> of mice and other vermin. The Gemara resolves the apparent contradiction: It is <b>not difficult. This</b> ruling in the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to a black</b> cat, which is harmless, whereas <b>that</b> ruling of Rav is stated <b>with regard to a white</b> cat, which is dangerous.
The Gemara raises a difficulty against this answer: <b>But</b> in <b>the incident of Rav</b> it <b>was a black</b> cat. Since this cat severed the baby’s hand, it was obviously a vicious, dangerous animal. The Gemara answers: <b>There it was a black</b> cat, but it was <b>the offspring of a white</b> one. The offspring of a white cat is dangerous, even if it itself is black. The Gemara further objects: <b>But didn’t Ravina raise this</b> very issue <b>as a dilemma?</b>
<b>As Ravina raised a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a black</b> cat that is <b>the offspring of a white</b> one? Is it also dangerous like its parent? The Gemara answers: <b>When Ravina raised the dilemma,</b> it was <b>with regard to a black</b> cat that is <b>the offspring of a white</b> cat that itself is <b>the offspring of a black</b> cat. By contrast, in <b>the incident with Rav</b> it <b>was a black</b> cat that was <b>the offspring of a white</b> one, which was itself <b>the offspring of a white</b> cat. That animal is definitely dangerous.
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the distinguishing letters in the various names of the sons of Rav Pappa in the ensuing list: <b><i>Ḥet beit dalet</i>, <i>beit yod ḥet</i>, <i>beit ḥet nun</i>. Rabbi Aḥa bar Pappa says</b> the following three statements <b>in the name of Rabbi Abba bar Pappa,</b> who said them <b>in the name of Rabbi Adda bar Pappa. And some say Rabbi Abba bar Pappa says</b> them <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Pappa,</b> who said them <b>in the name of Rabbi Aḥa bar Pappa. And some say Rabbi Abba bar Pappa says</b> them <b>in the name of Rabbi Aḥa bar Pappa,</b> who said them <b>in the name of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa.</b>
The three statements are as follows: The court <b>sounds the alarm on Shabbat over</b> a breakout of <b>sores; and a door that is locked will not be opened quickly; and</b> with regard to <b>one who purchases a house in Eretz Yisrael, one writes a bill of sale for</b> this transaction <b>even on Shabbat.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: After explaining how the public engages in prayer when there is a drought, the <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all other types of calamities that break out upon the community,</b> other than drought, <b>such as sores,</b> a plague of <b>locusts, flies, hornets, or mosquitoes, or infestations of snakes or scorpions,</b> the court <b>would not sound the alarm</b> on Shabbat, <b>but</b> the people would <b>cry out.</b> This indicates that it is not proper to sound the alarm on Shabbat for an epidemic of sores.
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here</b> it is referring <b>to moist</b> sores; whereas <b>there</b> it is referring <b>to dry</b> sores, which are more dangerous than moist ones. <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> The <b>boils that the Holy One, Blessed be He, brought upon the Egyptians</b> were <b>moist on the outside and dry on the inside, as it is stated: “And it became a boil breaking out with oozing upon man and upon beast”</b> (Exodus 9:10). The phrase “breaking out” is referring to the exterior of the wound. Since the verse specifies that the outside was oozing with secretions, it can be inferred that the inside was dry. This indicates that the sores can be of either type.
The Gemara analyzes the second of the three statements: <b>And a door that is locked will not be opened quickly.</b> This is clearly a metaphor, but to <b>what is it</b> referring? <b>Mar Zutra said:</b> It is a metaphor for rabbinic <b>ordination.</b> If one meets with resistance in his quest to receive ordination, he should take it as a sign that this opportunity will not soon open up for him again. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It means that <b>anyone who is treated poorly will not soon be treated well. Rav Aḥa of Difti said: He will never be treated well.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so; Rav Aḥa of Difti was saying</b> only <b>a matter</b> that reflected what had occurred <b>to him.</b>
The Gemara turns its attention to the third statement: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>one who purchases a house in Eretz Yisrael, one writes a bill of sale for</b> this transaction <b>even on Shabbat.</b> The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that one may write this bill of sale <b>on Shabbat?</b> Writing on Shabbat is a prohibited labor for which one is liable to receive the death penalty.
The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> this is <b>as Rava said there,</b> with regard to a similar issue, that one <b>tells a gentile</b> to do it, <b>and he does</b> so. <b>Here, too,</b> it is referring to a situation where he <b>tells a gentile</b> to write a bill of sale for the house, <b>and he does</b> it. <b>And even though telling a gentile</b> to perform an action that is prohibited for a Jew on Shabbat <b>is</b> generally a violation of <b>a rabbinic decree,</b> as the Sages prohibited telling a gentile to perform prohibited labor on behalf of a Jew on Shabbat, here <b>the Sages did not</b> impose this <b>decree, due to</b> the mitzva of <b>settling Eretz Yisrael.</b>
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who purchases a city in Eretz Yisrael,</b> the court <b>forces him to purchase a path to</b> the city <b>from</b> all <b>four</b> of <b>its sides, due to</b> the importance of <b>settling Eretz Yisrael.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Joshua stipulated ten conditions</b> when he apportioned Eretz Yisrael among the tribes:

Daf 81a

The conditions are <b>that</b> people <b>shall</b> have the right to <b>graze</b> their animals <b>in forests,</b> even on private property; <b>and</b> that <b>they</b> shall have the right to <b>gather wood from</b> each other’s <b>fields,</b> to be used as animal fodder; <b>and</b> that <b>they</b> shall have the right to <b>gather</b> wild <b>vegetation</b> for animal fodder in any place <b>except for</b> a field of <b>fenugreek; and</b> that <b>they</b> shall have the right to <b>pluck off a shoot anywhere</b> for propagation and planting, <b>except for olive shoots; and</b> that <b>the people of the city</b> shall have the right to <b>take supplies</b> of water from a spring on private property, even <b>from a spring that emerges for the first time; and</b> that <b>they</b> shall have the right to <b>fish in the Sea of Tiberias,</b> i.e., the Sea of Galilee, <b>provided that</b> the fisherman <b>does not build an</b> underwater <b>fence</b> to catch fish, thereby <b>causing an impediment to boats.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues the list of Joshua’s ten conditions: <b>And</b> people shall have the right to <b>relieve themselves</b> outdoors <b>behind a fence, even in a field</b> that is <b>full of saffron [<i>karkom</i>]; and they</b> shall have the right to <b>walk in permitted paths,</b> i.e., those paths that cut through a private field, throughout the summer <b>until the second rainfall,</b> when crops begin to sprout; <b>and they</b> shall have the right to <b>veer off to the sides of the roads</b> onto private property <b>because of hard protrusions [<i>yeteidot</i>] of the road; and one who becomes lost among the vineyards</b> shall have the right to <b>cut down branches and enter</b> an area of the vineyard, or <b>cut down branches and exit</b> an area of the vineyard, until he finds his way back to the road; <b>and</b> that <b>a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>] acquires its place</b> and is buried where it was found.
The first condition mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>that</b> people shall have the right to <b>graze</b> their animals <b>in forests. Rav Pappa said: We said</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to <b>small</b> domesticated animals, i.e., sheep or goats, that graze <b>in</b> a forest of <b>large</b> trees. Small animals grazing in a forest of this kind would not destroy it. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>small</b> animals grazing <b>in</b> a forest with <b>small</b> growth, or <b>large</b> animals, e.g., oxen, grazing <b>in</b> a forest of <b>large</b> trees, these practices are <b>not</b> permitted, as in either of these scenarios the practice would destroy the forest. <b>And, all the more so,</b> it is understood <b>that large</b> animals grazing <b>in</b> a forest with <b>small</b> growth is <b>not</b> permitted.
The Gemara discusses the next condition mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> that <b>they</b> shall have the right to <b>gather wood from</b> each other’s <b>fields,</b> to be used as animal fodder. The Gemara comments: <b>We said</b> this <b>only with regard to</b> twigs of <b>thorns and shrubs,</b> as the field’s owner does not care about these. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>other</b> types of <b>wood,</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted. <b>And even with regard to</b> twigs of <b>thorns and shrubs, we said</b> this <b>only when</b> they are <b>attached</b> to the ground. <b>But when</b> they have been <b>detached</b> by the owner it is <b>not</b> permitted, as he has already claimed them for himself.
<b>And even when</b> they are <b>attached we said</b> this <b>only when</b> the twigs are still <b>moist, but when</b> they are completely <b>dry</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted, as the owner requires these for firewood. Moreover, it is permitted only <b>provided that one does not uproot</b> the thorn bush or shrub from the ground, but it is prohibited to pull them out with their roots.
The Gemara further discusses Joshua’s conditions: <b>And</b> that <b>they</b> shall have the right to <b>gather</b> wild <b>vegetation</b> for animal fodder in any place <b>except for</b> a field of <b>fenugreek.</b> The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that</b> wild <b>vegetation is good for fenugreek,</b> and therefore the owner wants it to be left in his field? The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna that deals with diverse kinds (<i>Kilayim</i> 2:5): With regard to <b>fenugreek that sprouted alongside</b> various <b>types of</b> wild <b>vegetation, one is not required to uproot</b> the vegetation. Although it is generally prohibited to grow different species of vegetables together in one patch, if the species have a negative impact on each other’s growth, it is not prohibited. In this case the wild vegetation may be left alongside the fenugreek because it is harmful to it, and the <i>halakhot</i> of diverse kinds do not apply in a case of this kind.
<b>Rav Yirmeya said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the mishna is referring to a case where the fenugreek was planted <b>for</b> its <b>seeds; there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that lists Joshua’s conditions is referring to fenugreek planted <b>for</b> its <b>stalks.</b> When it is planted <b>for</b> its <b>seeds,</b> wild <b>vegetation is bad for it, as it weakens</b> the fenugreek and lowers its yield. But when it is planted <b>for</b> its <b>stalks,</b> wild vegetation is <b>good for it, as when it is situated among vegetation it climbs on it</b> and thereby grows to a larger size.
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead another answer: <b>Here,</b> the mishna is referring to a case where the fenugreek was planted <b>for human</b> consumption; and <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to fenugreek planted <b>for animal</b> consumption. <b>Since</b> the owner <b>sowed</b> the fenugreek <b>for animal</b> consumption, the wild <b>vegetation is also required by him,</b> as this too can be used for animal fodder. <b>And how can we know</b> if a particular fenugreek field was planted for human or animal consumption, and thereby know whether the vegetation may be picked and taken? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> If he planted it <b>in rows [<i>mesharei</i>],</b> it is <b>for human</b> consumption; if he did <b>not</b> plant <b>in rows</b> but planted haphazardly, it is <b>for animal</b> consumption.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And</b> that <b>they</b> shall have the right to <b>pluck off a shoot anywhere</b> for propagation and planting, <b>except for olive shoots,</b> as this would cause damage to the olive tree. <b>Rabbi Tanḥum and Rabbi Berayes explained</b> this <b>in the name of a certain elder: With regard to olive</b> trees, one must leave a shoot <b>the size of an egg</b> on the trunk when detaching it from the trunk; in the case <b>of reeds and grape vines,</b> he may take shoots only <b>from the</b> place of the first <b>knot and above. And</b> with regard to <b>all other trees,</b> shoots may be taken only <b>from the thick</b> part <b>of</b> the <b>tree,</b> where there are many branches growing, <b>but not from the thin</b> part <b>of</b> the <b>tree.</b>
Furthermore, one may take <b>from a new</b> branch, <b>which does not</b> yet <b>produce fruit, but not from old</b> branches, <b>which do produce fruit;</b> and one may take <b>from a place that does not face the sun,</b>

Daf 81b

<b>but not from a place that faces the sun,</b> where the fruits grow copiously, <b>as it is stated: “And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:14).
The <i>baraita</i> further states: <b>And the people of the city</b> shall have the right to <b>take supplies</b> of water from a spring on private property, even <b>from a spring that emerges for the first time. Rabba bar Rav Huna says: And</b> although one may draw water from that spring, <b>he</b> must <b>give money to</b> reimburse the owner of the property. The Gemara concludes: <b>But the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with his</b> opinion, as the water may be taken without payment.
The next of Joshua’s conditions is: <b>And</b> that <b>they</b> shall have the right to <b>fish in the Sea of Tiberias, provided that</b> the fisherman <b>does not build an</b> underwater <b>fence</b> to catch fish, thereby <b>causing an impediment to boats.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>But one may fish with nets and with traps. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Initially, the tribes stipulated with each other that one may not build</b> an underwater <b>fence</b> to catch fish, thereby <b>causing an impediment to boats, but one may fish with nets and with traps.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Sea of Tiberias was</b> located <b>in the portion of</b> the tribe of <b>Naphtali. Moreover,</b> the tribe of Naphtali <b>received</b> in addition a small stretch of land equal to <b>the full</b> length of the <b>rope of</b> a fish <b>trap.</b> This stretch of land was located <b>to the south</b> of the sea, where the members of this tribe could spread out their fishing nets, <b>to fulfill that which is stated:</b> “And of Naphtali he said: O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the Lord; <b>possess the sea and the south”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:23).
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Detached</b> items <b>that are</b> found <b>in the mountains</b> at the time of conquest <b>are</b> considered to be <b>in the possession of all the tribes</b> equally, as spoils of war; <b>but</b> that which is <b>attached,</b> e.g., trees, <b>are</b> considered to be <b>in the</b> sole <b>possession of that tribe</b> that would receive the land where the tree was found.
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And you do not have a single tribe of Israel that did not have</b> in its portion at least some land <b>in the mountains, and</b> some <b>in the lowland, and</b> some <b>in the countryside, and</b> some <b>in the valley, as it is stated: “Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites and to all their neighbors, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the lowland, and in the countryside, and by the seashore”</b> (Deuteronomy 1:7). <b>And you find similarly with regard to the Canaanites and Perizzites and Amorites who</b> inhabited the land <b>before</b> the Jews, <b>as it stated</b> in the above verse: “The Amorites <b>and to all their neighbors.” Apparently,</b> the Amorites and <b>their neighbors</b> all <b>had this</b> variety of types of land in their respective territories.
§ The Gemara discusses the next of Joshua’s conditions: <b>And</b> people shall have the right to <b>relieve themselves</b> outdoors <b>behind a fence, even in a field</b> that is <b>full of saffron. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> It goes without saying that one may relieve himself when necessary; this stipulation <b>is necessary only</b> to permit the one relieving himself <b>to take a stone out of</b> a wall in the field with which to clean himself. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: And</b> it is permitted to remove a stone from a wall for this purpose <b>even on Shabbat. Mar Zutra the Pious would take</b> a stone in this manner on Shabbat <b>and replace</b> it in the wall, <b>and say to his attendant</b> after Shabbat: <b>Go and plaster it over,</b> so that it would fit securely back in the wall.
The <i>baraita</i> further states: <b>And they</b> shall have the right to <b>walk in permitted paths,</b> i.e., those paths that cut through a private field, throughout the summer <b>until the second rainfall,</b> when crops begin to sprout. <b>Rav Pappa said: And</b> with regard to <b>these</b> fields that we have in Babylonia, <b>even dew</b> that settled the previous night <b>is bad for them.</b> Even after a night of dew, the field is sufficiently moistened that trampling on it will cause damage, and therefore this condition does not apply if there was dew the previous night.
The next item on the list of conditions is: <b>And they</b> shall have the right to <b>veer off to the sides of the roads</b> onto private property <b>because of hard protrusions of the road.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Shmuel and Rav Yehuda,</b> who lived in Babylonia, <b>were</b> once <b>walking along the road,</b> and <b>Shmuel veered off to the sides of the road</b> onto private property. <b>Rav Yehuda said to him:</b> Do the <b>conditions that Joshua stipulated</b> apply <b>even in Babylonia?</b> Shmuel <b>said to him:</b> Indeed so, <b>as I say</b> that they apply <b>even outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael.
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabbi Ḥiyya were</b> once <b>walking along the road,</b> and <b>they veered off to the sides of the road. Rabbi Yehuda ben Kanosa was taking broad steps</b> on the road, to avoid the protrusions without going off to the side of the road, <b>while walking in front of them. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to Rabbi Ḥiyya: Who is this</b> man <b>who is showing off</b> his supposed <b>greatness in our presence?</b> By acting more stringently than required by <i>halakha</i>, he is displaying insolence.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya said to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Perhaps it is my student Rabbi Yehuda ben Kanosa. And</b> if so, <b>all of his actions are</b> undertaken <b>for the sake of Heaven;</b> he is not acting out of haughtiness. <b>When they reached him</b> and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>saw him, he said to him: If you were not Yehuda ben Kanosa I would have cut off your legs with iron shears,</b> i.e., I would have excommunicated you for your impudence.
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches: <b>And one who becomes lost among the vineyards</b> shall have the right to <b>cut down [<i>mefaseig</i>] branches and enter</b> an area of the vineyard, or <b>cut down branches and exit</b> an area of the vineyard, until he finds his way back to the road. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that this stipulation extends further: With regard to <b>one who sees another</b> person <b>lost among the vineyards, he may cut down branches and enter</b> an area of the vineyard, or <b>cut down branches and exit</b> an area of the vineyard <b>until he</b> reaches him and <b>brings him</b> back <b>up to the city or to the road. And similarly,</b> if <b>he</b> himself is the one <b>who is lost among the vineyards, he may cut down branches and enter</b> an area of the vineyard, or <b>cut down branches and exit</b> an area of the vineyard <b>until he comes</b> back <b>up to the city or to the road.</b>
The Gemara asks a question with regard to this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the point of the clause that begins with: <b>And similarly?</b> It is obvious that a lost individual himself has the same right to cut down branches as one who assists him to find his way out. The Gemara answers: That is taught <b>lest you say</b> that it is only <b>another</b> person who is permitted to cut down branches, <b>as,</b> having seen the lost party, <b>he knows</b> exactly <b>where he is going</b> to rescue the other and help him leave the vineyard, and <b>that</b> is why <b>he may cut down branches; but</b> with regard to the lost person himself, <b>who does not know where he is going,</b> one might have said that <b>he may not cut down branches</b> but must <b>go</b> all the way <b>back to the boundary</b> of the vineyard. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that one who is lost may cut down branches in his quest to find his own way to the nearby town or road.
The Gemara asks a further question: Why was it necessary for Joshua to stipulate that one may find his way out in this manner? After all, <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> applies <b>by Torah law.</b> When one is lost, whoever can assist in helping him find his way must do so by Torah law, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There is a mitzva to return lost items to their owner. <b>From where</b> is it derived that the requirement applies even to <b>returning his body,</b> i.e., helping a lost person find his way? <b>The verse states: “And you shall restore it</b> to him” (Deuteronomy 22:2), which can also be translated as: And you shall restore himself to him. If this is required by Torah law, why did Joshua stipulate a condition to this effect?
The Gemara answers: <b>By Torah law</b> one is required only to walk in a roundabout path <b>along the boundaries,</b> without damaging another’s vines by cutting off branches. Joshua <b>came and instituted</b> the stipulation <b>that one may</b> go even further and <b>cut off branches and ascend</b> or <b>cut off branches and descend,</b> thereby leaving through the most direct route.
The Gemara addresses the last stipulation in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> that <b>a corpse with no one to bury it [<i>met mitzva</i>] acquires its place</b> and is buried where it was found. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who finds a corpse laid out on a main street [<i>isratya</i>] evacuates it</b> for burial either <b>to the right of the street or to the left of the street,</b> but it may not be buried under the main street itself. If one can move the corpse either to <b>a fallow field or</b> to <b>a plowed field, he evacuates it to the fallow field.</b>
If the choice is between <b>a plowed field and a sown field, he evacuates it to the plowed field.</b> If <b>both</b> fields <b>were fallow,</b> or if <b>both</b> were <b>plowed,</b> or if <b>both</b> were <b>sown, he evacuates it to any side where he wishes</b> to move it. According to this <i>baraita</i>, a <i>met mitzva</i> is not necessarily buried where it is found. It may be moved elsewhere.
<b>Rav Beivai said:</b> The ruling of this <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to</b> a corpse <b>laid out on the pathway.</b> Were the corpse buried there, it would prohibit passage by priests. <b>Since permission was</b> already <b>granted to evacuate it</b> from there, <b>one may evacuate it to any place he wishes.</b> If, however, the corpse was in a field, it would be prohibited to move it.
§ The Gemara returns to the opening statement of the <i>baraita</i>, that Joshua stipulated ten conditions. The Gemara <b>says:</b> Are there really only <b>ten? These</b> conditions enumerated in the <i>baraita</i> <b>are</b> actually <b>eleven.</b> The Gemara answers: The condition that <b>one may walk in permitted paths</b> that cut through a private field in the summer was not instituted by Joshua; rather, King <b>Solomon said it.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one’s produce was completely</b> harvested <b>from the field, but he does not allow people to enter into his field</b> to shorten their route, <b>what do people say about him?</b> They say: <b>What benefit does so-and-so have</b> by denying entry into his field? <b>And what harm are people causing him</b> by traversing his field? <b>Concerning him, the verse says: Do not be called wicked</b> by refraining <b>from being good.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is it</b> really <b>written: Do not be called wicked</b> by refraining <b>from being good?</b> There is no such verse in the Bible. The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> an idea <b>like this</b> is found in the Bible, albeit in a slightly different form, as <b>it is written like this: “Withhold not good from him to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it”</b> (Proverbs 3:27).
The Gemara further questions the statement of the <i>baraita</i> that Joshua instituted ten stipulations: <b>And is there nothing more</b> that Joshua instituted? <b>But there is</b> also the stipulation mentioned <b>by Rabbi Yehuda. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: During the time of manure removal, a person may remove his manure</b> from his property <b>into the public thoroughfare and pile it up</b> there for <b>a full thirty</b> days, <b>so that it should be trodden by the feet of people and by the feet of animals,</b> thereby improving its quality, as it was <b>on this condition</b> that <b>Joshua apportioned Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to the Jewish people.</b>
The Gemara continues this line of questioning: <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>there are</b> the stipulations mentioned <b>by Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: It is a stipulation of the court,</b> i.e., it is an automatic right even when not explicitly granted, <b>that this</b> owner of a bee colony <b>may enter the field of another and chop off the other’s branch</b> in order <b>to save his</b> bee <b>colony, and</b> afterward <b>he gives him</b> the <b>value of the other’s</b> severed <b>branch.</b> That is, if a beekeeper finds that one of his colonies has relocated to a tree in a neighboring field, he may bring it back to his own property together with the branch, provided that he later reimburses the owner of the tree.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And it is</b> also <b>a stipulation of the court that this</b> bearer of wine <b>pours out his wine</b> from his barrel <b>and</b> uses the barrel <b>to save another’s</b> spilling <b>honey,</b> which is more valuable than the wine, <b>and</b> then <b>he takes</b> the <b>value of his wine from the</b> saved <b>honey of the other,</b> as reimbursement. <b>And it is</b> likewise <b>a stipulation of the court that this</b> owner of wood <b>unloads his wood</b> from his donkey <b>and loads another’s flax,</b> which is more valuable than wood, if the load of flax is stranded on the road due to a mishap, <b>and</b> later <b>he takes</b> the <b>value of his wood from the</b> saved <b>flax of that other</b> individual. Once again, the reason is that it was <b>on this condition</b> that <b>Joshua apportioned Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to the Jewish people.</b>
The Gemara explains why the stipulations mentioned by Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yishmael are omitted by the earlier <i>baraita</i>: In the <i>baraita</i>, <b>we are not speaking of individual</b> opinions, but only of those that are accepted by all the Sages.

Daf 82a

The Gemara further questions the number of Joshua’s stipulations: <b>But when Rabbi Avin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>both a tree that leans into the field of another and a tree that is close to a boundary</b> with another field, the owner of the tree <b>brings</b> the first fruits of the tree <b>and recites</b> the accompanying declaration, as described in Deuteronomy 26:5–10, <b>as</b> it was <b>on this condition</b> that <b>Joshua apportioned Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to the Jewish people.</b> This is an additional stipulation by Joshua, which means that there are more than ten.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, who</b> is the one who <b>taught</b> the <i>baraita</i> that deals with the <b>ten conditions that Joshua stipulated? It is Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi,</b> an <i>amora</i>. Therefore, Rabbi Yoḥanan, another <i>amora</i>, can disagree with it. <b>Rav Geviha from Bei Katil teaches</b> this <b>explicitly</b> in his version of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Tanḥum and Rabbi Berayes say in the name of a certain elder, and who is that</b> elder? It is <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: Joshua stipulated ten conditions.</b>
§ The Sages taught that <b>Ezra</b> the Scribe <b>instituted ten ordinances:</b> He instituted <b>that</b> communities <b>read</b> the Torah <b>on Shabbat in the afternoon; and they</b> also <b>read</b> the Torah <b>on</b> every <b>Monday and Thursday; and</b> the courts convene and <b>judge</b> every <b>Monday and Thursday; and one does laundry on Thursday; and one eats garlic on Shabbat eve. And</b> Ezra further instituted <b>that a woman should rise early and bake</b> bread on those days when she wants to bake; <b>and that a woman should don a breechcloth; and that a woman should</b> first <b>comb</b> her hair <b>and</b> only then <b>immerse</b> in a ritual bath after being ritually impure; <b>and that peddlers</b> of cosmetics and perfumes <b>should travel around through</b> all <b>the towns. And</b> Ezra further <b>instituted</b> the requirement of <b>immersion for those who experienced a seminal emission.</b>
The Gemara analyzes these ordinances, the first of which is <b>that</b> communities <b>shall read</b> the Torah <b>on Shabbat afternoon.</b> This Gemara explains that this ordinance was instituted <b>due to those who sit</b> idly on street <b>corners,</b> who do not attend the synagogue during the week.
The Gemara discusses the second of Ezra’s ordinances: <b>And that they should read</b> the Torah <b>on</b> every <b>Monday and Thursday.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Did Ezra institute</b> this practice? <b>But it was instituted from the beginning,</b> i.e., long before his time. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; <b>and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water”</b> (Exodus 15:22). <b>Those who interpret verses</b> metaphorically <b>said</b> that <b>water</b> here is referring to <b>nothing other than Torah, as it is stated</b> metaphorically, concerning those who desire wisdom: <b>“Ho, everyone who thirsts, come for water”</b> (Isaiah 55:1).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The verse means that <b>since</b> the Jews <b>traveled for three days without</b> hearing any <b>Torah they became weary,</b> and therefore the <b>prophets among them arose and instituted for them that they should read</b> from the Torah each <b>Shabbat, and pause</b> on <b>Sunday, and read</b> again on <b>Monday, and pause</b> on <b>Tuesday and Wednesday, and read</b> again on <b>Thursday, and pause</b> on <b>Shabbat eve, so they would not tarry three days without</b> hearing the <b>Torah.</b> Evidently this practice predates Ezra.
The Gemara answers: <b>Initially they instituted</b> that <b>one man</b> read <b>three verses;</b> or <b>alternatively,</b> that <b>three men</b> read <b>three verses.</b> Either way, the number three <b>corresponds to</b> the three types of Jews: <b>Priests, Levites, and Israelites.</b> Ezra later <b>came</b> and <b>instituted</b> that <b>three men</b> always read, <b>and</b> that <b>ten verses</b> altogether be read by them, <b>corresponding to the ten idlers</b> in a city, i.e., the ten men who are paid to spend their time dealing with synagogue and communal matters.
The next ordinance of Ezra is: <b>And</b> the courts convene and <b>judge</b> every <b>Monday and Thursday.</b> The Gemara explains that the reason for this ordinance is <b>that</b> many people are <b>found</b> in a city on these days, <b>as they come</b> from the countryside <b>for the reading of the</b> holy <b>book,</b> the Torah, which is performed on Mondays and Thursdays, as stated above.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And that one should do laundry on Thursday.</b> This was instituted <b>due to</b> the need to have clean garments in <b>deference to Shabbat.</b>
The Gemara explains the next listed ordinance: <b>And that one should eat garlic Shabbat eve.</b> This is <b>due to</b> the fact that garlic enhances sexual potency, and Friday night is an appropriate time for <b>conjugal relations. As it is written</b> concerning the righteous: “And he shall be like a tree planted by streams of water, <b>who brings forth his fruit in his season”</b> (Psalms 1:3); <b>and Rabbi Yehuda says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Naḥman, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Kahana, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who said: <b>This</b> is referring to <b>one who engages in sexual intercourse every Shabbat eve.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>five matters were stated with regard to garlic: It satisfies; it warms</b> the body; <b>it causes</b> one’s <b>countenance to shine; it increases</b> one’s <b>sperm, and it kills lice that are in the intestines. And some say</b> that it also <b>instills love</b> into those who eat it <b>and removes jealousy</b> from them.
The next ordinance is: <b>And that a woman should rise early and bake</b> bread on those days when she bakes. This Gemara explains that this was instituted <b>so that bread should be available for poor people,</b> who go begging for bread in the mornings.
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches: <b>And that a woman should don a breechcloth [<i>sinar</i>].</b> This ordinance was instituted <b>due to</b> reasons of <b>modesty.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And that a woman should</b> first <b>comb</b> her hair <b>and</b> only then <b>immerse</b> in a ritual bath. This is to ensure that there is no dirt or other substance in the hair that would invalidate the immersion. The Gemara questions this: <b>This is</b> required <b>by Torah law,</b> Ezra did not institute this.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, concerning a verse that discusses one who must undergo ritual immersion: <b>“And he shall bathe his flesh [<i>et besaro</i>] in water”</b> (Leviticus 14:9). This verse teaches <b>that no substance should interpose between his flesh and the water.</b> When the verse states this in the expanded form of <b>“<i>et</i> his flesh,”</b> using the term “<i>et</i>,” this teaches that the water must come into contact even with <b>that which is subordinate to his flesh. And what is that?</b> It is one’s <b>hair.</b> Accordingly, the Torah itself states that there may not be any interposing substance in the hair at the time of immersion. What, then, did Ezra add?
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>By Torah law</b> one is required <b>to inspect</b> his or her hair before immersion, as <b>perhaps</b> some hairs are <b>knotted</b> together, preventing contact with water at that spot, <b>or</b> perhaps there is some <b>repulsive substance</b> in his hair. One must perform this inspection <b>because</b> these would constitute <b>an interposition.</b>

Daf 82b

<b>And</b> Ezra <b>came</b> and added to the Torah’s minimal obligation. He <b>instituted</b> the requirement of <b>combing</b> the hair even when it is known that it is not knotted and contains no repulsive substance.
The Gemara discusses the next of Ezra’s ordinances: <b>And that peddlers should circulate through</b> all <b>the towns.</b> This Gemara explains that this is <b>because</b> peddlers supply <b>women’s cosmetics,</b> and therefore Ezra instituted this practice <b>so that</b> women <b>should not become unattractive to their husbands.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the last of the ten ordinances: <b>And he instituted</b> the requirement of <b>immersion for those who experienced a seminal emission.</b> The Gemara asks: But this <b>is</b> required <b>by Torah law, as it is written: “And if the flow of seed go out from a man, then he shall bathe</b> all <b>his flesh in water”</b> (Leviticus 15:16). The Gemara answers: <b>By Torah law</b> immersion <b>is</b> required only if one wishes to partake <b>of <i>teruma</i> or sacrificial</b> meat. Ezra <b>came</b> and further <b>instituted</b> that immersion is necessary <b>even for</b> reciting or studying <b>matters of Torah.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that one may not raise chickens in Jerusalem. The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that contains a list of other <i>halakhot</i> that are unique to Jerusalem. <b>Ten matters were stated with regard to Jerusalem: A house</b> situated <b>in</b> Jerusalem does <b>not</b> become <b>irredeemable</b> one year after its sale. Those who sell houses in other walled cities have the right to buy back their property for one year after the transaction. If they fail to do so, the house becomes the permanent possession of the buyer (see Leviticus 25:29–30). This <i>halakha</i> does not apply to houses in Jerusalem. <b>And</b> its Elders do <b>not bring a heifer whose neck is broken</b> as required when a murder victim is found near a city and the murderer is unknown (see Deuteronomy 21:1–9); <b>and</b> it <b>cannot become an idolatrous city</b> (see Deuteronomy 13:13–19).
The <i>baraita</i> continues its list: <b>And</b> a house in Jerusalem <b>cannot become ritually impure</b> with the impurity <b>of leprous sores; and one may not build out projections or balconies [<i>gezuztraot</i>]</b> from houses that are <b>in it; and one may not establish garbage dumps in</b> Jerusalem; <b>and one may not build kilns in it; and one may not plant gardens and orchards [<i>pardesot</i>] in it, except for</b> the <b>rose gardens that were</b> already there <b>from the times of the early prophets; and one may not raise chickens in it; and</b> finally, <b>one may not leave a corpse overnight in</b> Jerusalem.
The Gemara discusses these ten <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to Jerusalem, one by one: <b>A house</b> situated <b>in</b> it does <b>not</b> become <b>irredeemable</b> one year after its sale. The reason is <b>that it is written:</b> “And if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then <b>the house</b> that is in the <b>walled</b> city <b>shall be made sure in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations”</b> (Leviticus 25:30). <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> who taught this <i>baraita</i> <b>maintains</b> that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to</b> any single one of <b>the tribes</b> of Israel; rather, it is considered common property. Since no one has ancestral ownership of any house in Jerusalem, its houses cannot be sold permanently.
The Gemara analyzes the next <i>halakha</i>: <b>And</b> its inhabitants do <b>not bring a heifer whose neck is broken.</b> The reason is <b>that it is written: “If one is found slain in the land that the Lord your God gives you to possess it”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:1). <b>And,</b> again, the <i>tanna</i> who taught this <i>baraita</i> <b>maintains</b> that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to</b> any one of <b>the tribes</b> of Israel. Therefore, it is not included in the description: “The land that the Lord your God gives you to possess it.”
The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And</b> it <b>cannot become an idolatrous city.</b> The reason is <b>that it is written,</b> in the introduction of the passage dealing with the <i>halakha</i> of an idolatrous city: “If you shall hear tell concerning one of <b>your cities,</b> which the Lord your God gives you to dwell there” (Deuteronomy 13:13). <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> who taught this <i>baraita</i> maintains that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to</b> any one of <b>the tribes</b> of Israel. It is therefore not included in the description “one of your cities, which the Lord your God gives you to dwell there.”
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches: <b>And</b> a house in Jerusalem does <b>not become ritually impure</b> with the impurity <b>of leprous sores.</b> The reason is <b>that it is written: “And I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession”</b> (Leviticus 14:34). <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> who taught this <i>baraita</i> maintains that <b>Jerusalem was not apportioned to</b> any one of <b>the tribes</b> of Israel. It is there-fore not included in the description “a house of the land of your possession.”
The Gemara discusses the next <i>halakha</i>: <b>And one may not build out projections or balconies</b> from houses that are <b>in</b> Jerusalem. The Gemara provides two reasons for this prohibition. First, it is <b>due to</b> the danger of contracting <b>ritual impurity</b> by being in <b>the</b> same <b>tent</b> as a corpse, i.e., under the same roof, in which case the impurity spreads to all items under the roof. If even a small part of a corpse is under a balcony, everyone who passes under that balcony is rendered impure. Many people come to Jerusalem to sacrifice offerings, and they must maintain a state of ritual purity. The other reason is <b>so that those</b> great crowds of <b>pilgrims not be injured</b> by colliding with the projections.
The next <i>halakha</i> pertaining to Jerusalem is: <b>And one may not establish garbage dumps in it.</b> The Gemara explains that the reason is <b>due to</b> the <b>repugnant creatures</b> that are attracted to such heaps and impart ritual impurity upon their death.
The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And one may not build kilns in</b> Jerusalem. The reason is <b>due to the</b> unsightly <b>smoke</b> produced by kilns. The Sages sought to preserve the beauty of Jerusalem and the Temple.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And one may not plant gardens and orchards in it.</b> This is <b>due to the odor</b> emitted by these places, either from discarded weeds or from fertilizer.
The next <i>halakha</i> on the list is: <b>And one may not raise chickens in</b> Jerusalem. The Gemara explains that this is <b>due to the sacrificial</b> meat that is consumed in Jerusalem. Since chickens peck in the garbage, they are likely to pick up items that impart ritual impurity and bring them into contact with the consecrated food, which may not be eaten in an impure state.
The Gemara discusses the last <i>halakha</i>: <b>And one may not leave a corpse overnight in it.</b> The Gemara notes that this prohibition is <b>a tradition;</b> there is no known explanation for it.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>one may not raise pigs anywhere. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> the background for this <i>halakha</i>: <b>When</b> the members of <b>the house of Hasmonean</b> monarchy <b>were at war with each other, Hyrcanus,</b> one of the parties to this war, <b>was inside</b> the besieged Jerusalem, <b>while</b> his brother <b>Aristobulus,</b> the other contender to the throne, was <b>on the outside. And every day</b> the people inside <b>would lower down money in a box</b> from the Temple walls, to purchase sheep to sacrifice, <b>and</b> those on other side <b>would</b> take the money and <b>send up</b> sheep <b>to them</b> over the wall for the <b>daily offerings.</b>
<b>There was a certain elder there who was familiar with Greek wisdom,</b> and <b>he said</b> to those besieging Jerusalem: <b>As long as they occupy themselves with the</b> Temple <b>service, they will not be delivered into your hands. The next day they lowered down money in a box</b> as usual, <b>but</b> this time <b>they sent up to them a pig. When the pig reached to the midpoint of the</b> Temple <b>wall it stuck its hooves into the wall, and Eretz Yisrael quaked</b> over an area of <b>four hundred parasangs by four hundred parasangs.</b>
<b>At that time</b> the Sages <b>said: Cursed be the man who raises pigs, and cursed be the man who teaches his son Greek wisdom. And</b> it was <b>concerning that time</b> of siege that <b>we learned</b> in a mishna: There was <b>an incident</b> in which the barley for the <b><i>omer</i> offering came from the gardens of Tzerifin,</b> far from Jerusalem, <b>and</b> the wheat for <b>the two loaves</b> of <i>Shavuot</i> was brought <b>from the valley of Ein Sokher.</b> Barley and wheat could not be brought from any nearer because the besiegers had destroyed all the produce around Jerusalem. This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to this <i>baraita</i>: <b>And is</b> it really <b>prohibited</b> to study <b>Greek wisdom? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: In Eretz Yisrael,</b>

Daf 83a

<b>why</b> would one speak the <b>Syriac [<i>Sursi</i>] language?</b> One should speak <b>either the sacred tongue,</b> Hebrew, <b>or the Greek language. And Rabbi Yosei said</b> similarly: In <b>Babylonia, why</b> would one speak the <b>Aramaic language?</b> One should speak <b>either the sacred tongue or the Persian language.</b> At any rate, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s statement indicates that there is nothing wrong with learning and speaking Greek. The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>The Greek language</b> is <b>discrete, and Greek wisdom</b> is <b>discrete.</b> In other words, these are two separate issues; only Greek wisdom is prohibited, not the Greek language.
The Gemara further pursues this line of inquiry: <b>And is Greek wisdom</b> itself actually <b>prohibited? But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Shmuel says in the name of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel:</b> It is written: <b>“My eye affected my soul, because of all the daughters of my city”</b> (Lamentations 3:51). Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel applied this verse to a personal tragedy: <b>There were a thousand children in the household of</b> my <b>father,</b> Rabban Gamliel; <b>five hundred of them studied</b> the <b>Torah, and five hundred of them studied Greek wisdom.</b> All of them were killed by the Romans; <b>and the only</b> ones that <b>remain of them</b> are <b>I,</b> who is <b>here, and the son of</b> my <b>father’s brother,</b> who is <b>in Asia Minor [Asya]</b>. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s statement indicates that it is permitted to study Greek wisdom.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>The household of Rabban Gamliel is different, as they</b> held <b>close</b> ties <b>with the government.</b> Since knowledge of Greek wisdom was crucial for the members of this family, the Sages exempted them from the general decree, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one</b> who <b>cuts his hair</b> in the fashion of <b><i>komi</i>,</b> a certain haircut favored by the Romans, <b>this is</b> considered one <b>of the ways of the Amorites,</b> i.e., a gentile practice prohibited by the Torah (Leviticus 18:3). Despite this, the Sages <b>permitted Avtolmos bar Reuven to cut his hair</b> in the fashion of <b><i>komi</i>, because he</b> had <b>close</b> ties <b>with the government.</b> Like-wise, <b>they permitted</b> the members <b>of the household of Rabban Gamliel to discuss</b> matters <b>of Greek wisdom, because they</b> had <b>close</b> ties <b>with the government.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>A person may not raise a dog unless it is tied with chains. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not raise a dog unless it is tied with a chain. But he may raise</b> a dog <b>in a city that is close to the border</b> of the country, <b>and</b> in that case <b>he</b> should <b>tie it during the day but may release it at night.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: One who raises dogs is like one who raises pigs.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>significance</b> of this statement? Since both are prohibited, what is the point of this comparison? The Gemara answers: The significance is with regard <b>to determining when one is liable</b> to be <b>cursed for it.</b> Rabbi Eliezer is saying that the same curse meted out to one who raises pigs also applies to one who raises dogs.
<b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: Babylonia is</b> considered <b>like a city close to the border,</b> and therefore it is permitted to raise dogs there. The Gemara qualifies this statement, and in this context, Babylonia is <b>interpreted</b> as referring only to <b>Neharde’a,</b> a city that was close to the border.
With regard to raising dogs, <b>Rabbi Dostai from Biri expounded:</b> It is written in connection to the Ark of the Covenant: <b>“And when it rested, he said: Return, O Lord, to the myriads of the thousands of Israel”</b> (Numbers 10:36). This verse serves <b>to teach you that the Divine Presence does not rest upon the Jewish people</b> if they number <b>fewer than two thousand and two myriads,</b> where one myriad is equal to ten thousand. The plural form of “myriads” and “thousands” indicates at least two of each. If they are <b>lacking one</b> individual from this total, <b>and there was a pregnant woman among them, who was fit to complete</b> the number by giving birth, <b>and a dog barked at her and she miscarried</b> as a result of the fright, <b>this</b> owner of the dog <b>is found</b> to have <b>caused the Divine Presence to depart from the Jewish people.</b>
There was <b>a certain woman who entered a certain building to bake. A dog barked at her. Its owner said to her: Do not be afraid of it; its canine teeth have been removed. She said to him:</b> It is too late for your reassurances. <b>Take your favors and throw them on the thorns!</b> I have felt that <b>the baby has already moved</b> from its place in the womb and will not be born alive.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One may spread out traps for pigeons only</b> if this was performed at a distance of at least thirty <i>ris</i>, which is eight thousand cubits, from any settled area, to ensure that privately owned pigeons are not caught in the traps. The Gemara asks: <b>And do</b> pigeons really <b>travel that</b> far from their established places? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 23a): <b>One must distance a dovecote fifty cubits from the city,</b> so that the pigeons that settle in the cotes do not eat the crops that grow in the gardens of the city. This shows that the range of a pigeon is only fifty cubits, whereas four <i>mil</i> is eight thousand cubits. <b>Abaye said:</b> Pigeons <b>fly</b> much <b>more</b> than fifty cubits away from their cotes, but <b>their stomachs become full</b> from the food they find <b>within fifty cubits,</b> and therefore they do not eat any more beyond that range.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>flying,</b> is their range only <b>thirty <i>ris</i> and no more? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>In a settled area, one may not spread out</b> a trap for pigeons <b>even</b> at a distance of <b>one hundred <i>mil</i></b> from the settlement? This indicates that a privately owned pigeon might be trapped even one hundred <i>mil</i> away from a settled area. Why, then, does the mishna permit trapping beyond four <i>mil</i>? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is not talking about an ordinary city but <b>about a settled area</b> where <b>vineyards</b> are grown. Since the pigeons rest in the vineyards as they travel, they are able to traverse great distances. <b>Rabba stated</b> a different answer: The <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with a settled area</b> where there are many <b>dovecotes</b> in which they can rest from their flight.
The Gemara asks: If there are many dovecotes along the way, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>derive</b> the prohibition against setting pigeon traps <b>due to the dovecotes themselves.</b> Since the mishna teaches that it is prohibited to trap pigeons within four <i>mil</i> of privately owned dovecotes, it should be irrelevant that there is a city one hundred <i>mil</i> away. The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is dealing with dovecotes <b>that</b> belong <b>to a gentile,</b> and the prohibition against trapping pigeons from private dovecotes applies only to birds owned by Jews. <b>Or if you wish, say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is dealing <b>with</b> abandoned dovecotes <b>that</b> are <b>ownerless. Or if you wish, say</b> that it is referring to dovecotes <b>that are his,</b> i.e., they belong to the same individual who is setting the pigeon trap.

Daf 83b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who injures another is liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for that</b> injury <b>due to five types</b> of indemnity: He must pay <b>for damage, for pain, for medical costs, for loss of livelihood, and</b> for <b>humiliation.</b>
<b>How</b> is payment <b>for damage</b> assessed? If <b>one blinded</b> another’s <b>eye, severed his hand, broke his leg,</b> or caused any other injury, the court <b>views</b> the injured party <b>as though he were a slave</b> being <b>sold in the</b> slave <b>market, and</b> the court <b>appraises how much he was worth</b> before the injury <b>and how much he is worth</b> after the injury. The difference between these two sums is the amount that one must pay for causing damage.
How is payment for <b>pain</b> assessed? If <b>one burned</b> another <b>with a skewer [<i>beshapud</i>] or with</b> a hot <b>nail, or even</b> if one burned another <b>on his fingernail,</b> which is <b>a place where he does not cause a bruise</b> that would affect the victim’s value on the slave market, the court <b>evaluates how much</b> money <b>a person</b> with <b>a similar</b> threshold for pain <b>as</b> the victim <b>is willing to take</b> in order to be made <b>to suffer in this way.</b> The one who burned the victim must then pay this amount.
How is payment for <b>medical costs</b> assessed? If one <b>struck</b> another, then he is <b>liable to heal him</b> by paying for his medical costs. In a case where <b>growths,</b> e.g., blisters or rashes, <b>appeared on</b> the injured party, <b>if</b> the growths are <b>due to the blow,</b> the one who struck him is <b>liable;</b> if the growths are <b>not due to the blow,</b> the one who struck him is <b>exempt.</b> In a case where the wound <b>healed, and</b> then <b>reopened,</b> and again <b>healed, and</b> then <b>reopened,</b> the one who struck him remains <b>liable to heal</b> the injured party by paying for his medical costs, as it is apparent that the current wound resulted from the original injury. If the injury <b>healed fully,</b> the one who struck him <b>is not liable to heal him</b> by paying for any subsequent medical costs.
How is payment for <b>loss of livelihood</b> assessed? The court <b>views</b> the injured party <b>as though he were a watchman of cucumbers,</b> and the one who caused him injury must compensate him based on that pay scale for the income that he lost during his convalescence. This indemnity does not take into account the value of the standard wages of the injured party <b>because</b> the one who caused him injury <b>already gave him compensation for his hand or compensation for his leg,</b> and that compensation took into account his professional skills.
How is payment for <b>humiliation</b> assessed? <b>It all depends on</b> the stature of <b>the one who humiliates</b> the other <b>and the one who is humiliated.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does the mishna take for granted the fact that one who caused injury is liable to pay compensation to the injured party? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“An eye for an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24). You might <b>say</b> that this means that the one who caused injury shall lose <b>an actual eye</b> rather than pay money.
The Gemara responds: That interpretation should <b>not enter your mind.</b> The principle implicit in the mishna is derived from a verbal analogy in the Torah, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Based on the verse: “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot” (Exodus 21:24), one <b>might</b> have thought that if one <b>blinded the eye of</b> another, the court <b>blinds his eye</b> as punishment; or if one <b>severed the hand of</b> another, the court <b>severs his hand;</b> or if one <b>broke the leg of</b> another, the court <b>breaks his leg.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “One who strikes a person,”</b> and the verse also states: <b>“And one who strikes an animal,”</b> to teach that <b>just as one who strikes an animal</b> is liable <b>to</b> pay monetary <b>compensation, so too, one who strikes a person</b> is liable <b>to</b> pay monetary <b>compensation.</b>
<b>And if it is your wish to say</b> that there is an objection to this derivation, there is an alternative derivation: The verse <b>states:</b> “And <b>you shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death,</b> for he shall die” (Numbers 35:31). This indicates that it is only <b>for the life of a murderer</b> that <b>you shall not take ransom; but you</b> shall <b>take ransom for</b> one who severed another’s <b>extremities,</b> which is analogous to the death of a limb, <b>as</b> severed limbs <b>do not regenerate.</b>
The Gemara asks: To <b>which</b> verse is the <i>baraita</i> referring when it quotes: <b>“One who strikes</b> a person” and: “One who strikes an animal”? <b>If we say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the verse: <b>“One who strikes an animal shall pay its compensation, and one who strikes a person shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:21), this cannot be, as <b>that</b> verse <b>is written with regard to killing,</b> not injury, and there is no monetary compensation for killing.
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> references the verse <b>from here: “One who strikes an animal mortally shall pay its compensation, a life for a life”</b> (Leviticus 24:18); <b>and juxtaposed to that</b> is the verse: <b>“And if a man maims his neighbor, as he has done, so shall it be done to him”</b> (Leviticus 24:19). The Gemara challenges: But <b>this</b> latter verse <b>does not</b> use the expression: <b>“One who strikes,”</b> which is the basis for the comparison in the <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara responds: <b>We are stating</b> an analogy from <b>striking</b> to <b>striking</b> that is based not upon the exact phrasing of the verse but upon the details of the <i>halakha</i>, as follows: <b>Just as</b> the act of <b>striking that is stated with regard to an animal</b> renders one liable <b>to</b> pay monetary <b>compensation, so too,</b> the act of <b>striking that is stated with regard to a person</b> renders one liable <b>to</b> pay monetary <b>compensation.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it written</b> in the verses discussing one who injures another: <b>“And a man who strikes any person mortally shall be put to death”</b> (Leviticus 24:17), which presumably means that in the case of one who severs another’s extremity the same injury, i.e., death of a limb, is done to the one who caused the injury, and he does not pay monetary compensation? The Gemara answers: The verse does not mean that his limb shall be put to death, i.e., removed, but rather, that he should pay compensation <b>with money.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> do you say <b>that</b> the verse is referring to paying compensation <b>with money?</b> Why not <b>say</b> that he is punished <b>with actual death</b> i.e., loss of a limb?
The Gemara answers: That interpretation should <b>not enter your mind</b> for two reasons. <b>One</b> reason is that this verse <b>is juxtaposed to</b> the following verse: <b>“One who strikes an animal mortally shall pay its compensation”</b> (Leviticus 24:18). <b>And furthermore, it is written after it:</b> “A fracture for a fracture, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; <b>as he has given a blemish to a person, so shall it be given unto him”</b> (Leviticus 24:20); <b>and learn from</b> the use of the word “given” that the verse is referring to <b>money.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> potential difficulty with the first derivation did the <i>baraita</i> refer to when it prefaced its second derivation with the phrase: <b>If it is your wish to say?</b> The Gemara explains: The <i>baraita</i> means that <b>a further difficulty</b> was troubling <b>to the <i>tanna</i>: What did you see that</b> led <b>you</b> to <b>derive</b> the principle of monetary payment <b>from</b> the phrase <b>“one who strikes an animal”?</b> Why not <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the verse: <b>“One who strikes a person</b> shall be put to death” (Leviticus 24:21), and learn that causing an injury renders one liable to receive physical retribution, which is analogous to death, and not monetary payment?
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: The <i>halakhot</i> of <b>damages are derived from</b> a verse concerning <b>damages, and</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>damages are not derived from</b> a verse concerning <b>death.</b> The Gemara questions this statement: <b>On the contrary,</b> why not say that the <i>halakhot</i> concerning <b>a person are derived from</b> a verse concerning <b>a person, and</b> the <i>halakhot</i> concerning <b>a person are not derived from</b> a verse concerning <b>animals?</b>
To deflect this question, <b>this is</b> consistent with <b>that which</b> the second derivation of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: If it is your wish to say</b> that there is an objection to this derivation, there is an alternative derivation, as the verse <b>states:</b> “And <b>you shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death, for he shall die”</b> (Numbers 35:31). This indicates that it is only <b>for the life of a murderer</b> that <b>you shall not take ransom; but you</b> shall <b>take ransom for</b> one who severed another’s <b>extremities,</b> which is analogous to the death of a limb, <b>as</b> severed limbs <b>do not regenerate.</b>
The Gemara challenges this claim: <b>But is this</b> verse: <b>“You shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer,” coming to exclude</b> the case of one who severs another’s <b>extremities</b> from the prohibition against taking ransom? Isn’t <b>this</b> verse <b>necessary</b> to teach that <b>which the Merciful One states: You shall not mete out two</b> punishments <b>to him;</b> i.e., <b>do not take money from him</b> as ransom <b>and</b> also <b>kill him?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the verse: “Then it shall be, if the guilty deserves to be lashed, that the judge shall lie him down and flog him before him, <b>according to the measure of his evildoing”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:2). From the fact that “evildoing” is singular, the Gemara homiletically infers: For <b>one evildoing, you can render him liable, but you cannot render him liable</b> for <b>two evildoings,</b> i.e., one cannot receive two punishments for the same act.
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But</b> the verse: “You shall not take ransom for the life of a murderer, for one who is guilty of death” <b>is still necessary</b> to teach the primary <i>halakha</i> taught in that verse, in <b>which the Merciful One states: You shall not take money and</b> thereby <b>exempt</b> the guilty from being put to death. The verse does not serve to exclude liability to pay damages from the prohibition against paying restitution. The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the Torah desires to teach only that the court cannot take ransom to spare the murderer from being put to death, <b>let the Merciful One write</b> in the Torah: <b>“You shall not take ransom”</b> and follow it immediately with the phrase <b>“for one who is guilty of death.” Why do I</b> need the Torah to also state: <b>“For the life of a murderer”? Learn from</b> the addition of that phrase that it is only <b>for a murderer</b> that <b>you</b> shall <b>not take ransom; but you</b> shall <b>take ransom for</b> one who severed another’s <b>extremities, which do not regenerate</b> once severed.
The Gemara asks: <b>And once it is written: “You shall not take ransom,” why do I</b> need the first derivation of the <i>baraita</i>, which juxtaposes: <b>“One who strikes</b> a person” to: <b>“One who strikes</b> an animal”? The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> were to be derived only <b>from that</b> verse which states: “You shall not take ransom” (Numbers 35:31), <b>I would say: If</b> the one who caused the damage <b>desires, he</b> may choose to <b>give his eye, and if he desires, he</b> may choose to <b>give</b> the <b>monetary</b> value <b>of his eye.</b> Therefore, the Torah <b>teaches us</b> to derive this <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> that of <b>an animal: Just as one who strikes an animal</b> is liable <b>to</b> pay monetary <b>compensation</b> and does not receive corporal punishment, <b>so too, one who strikes a person</b> is liable <b>to</b> pay monetary <b>compensation</b> and does not receive corporal punishment.
§ The Gemara presents a series of derivations for the principle that one who injures another is liable to pay monetary compensation. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda says:</b> The phrase: <b>“An eye for an eye”</b> (Leviticus 24:20), means <b>monetary restitution.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that he must pay the victim <b>monetary restitution, or is it only</b> teaching that the one who caused the injury must lose <b>an actual eye? You say:</b> There may be a case where <b>the eye of</b> the one who caused the injury <b>is large and the eye of</b> the injured party is <b>small. How can I read</b> and literally apply the phrase <b>“an eye for an eye” in this</b> case?
The Gemara continues the derivation: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>in all cases like this,</b> where their eyes are different sizes, the injured party <b>takes monetary restitution</b> from the one who caused him injury, but in a case where their eyes are the same size, the one who caused injury is punished by actually having his eye removed, this cannot be, as <b>the Torah said: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), teaching that the <b>law</b> shall be <b>equal for all of you.</b>
The Sages object to this derivation and <b>say: What</b> is <b>the difficulty</b> in saying that his eye should be blinded? <b>Perhaps,</b> as the one who caused the injury <b>took</b> the <b>sight from</b> the injured party’s eye, <b>the Merciful One states</b> that the court should <b>take</b> the <b>sight from</b> his eye as well, no matter the size of the eye. <b>Since, if you do not say so,</b> then by the same logic,

Daf 84a

in the case of <b>a small</b> person <b>who killed a large</b> person, <b>or a large</b> person <b>who killed a small</b> person, <b>how do we kill</b> the murderer? If one suggests that in such a case a monetary penalty will be imposed, <b>the Torah stated: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), teaching that the <b>law</b> shall be <b>equal for all of you,</b> so the punishment must be the same for all murderers. <b>Rather,</b> explain that since the murderer <b>took the life of</b> the victim, <b>the Merciful One states that</b> the court should likewise <b>take the life from him. So too,</b> since the one who caused the injury <b>took</b> the <b>sight from</b> the eye of the injured party, <b>the Merciful One states</b> that the court should likewise <b>take</b> the <b>sight from</b> his eye. Therefore, the Gemara does not accept the derivation of Rabbi Dostai ben Yehuda, in accordance with the objection of the Sages.
The Gemara presents another derivation: It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: “An eye for an eye”</b> (Leviticus 24:20), is referring to <b>monetary restitution.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that this is referring to <b>monetary restitution, or is it only</b> teaching that the one who caused the injury must lose <b>an actual eye?</b> There may be a case where <b>there was a blind person and he blinded</b> another, or there was <b>one with a severed limb and he severed</b> the limb of another, or there was <b>a lame person and he caused</b> another <b>to be lame. In this</b> case, <b>how can I fulfill “an eye for an eye”</b> literally, when he is already lacking the limb that must be injured? If one will suggest that in that case, a monetary penalty will be imposed, that can be refuted: <b>But the Torah stated: “You shall have one manner of law”</b> (Leviticus 24:22), which teaches that <b>the law</b> shall be <b>equal for all of you.</b>
The Sages object to this derivation and <b>say: And what</b> is <b>the difficulty? Perhaps</b> in a case <b>where it is possible</b> to render the guilty party liable according to the punishment listed in the Torah, it is <b>possible</b> and the court does so; but in a case <b>where it is not possible</b> to enact such a punishment, it is <b>not possible, and we exempt him. As if you do not say so,</b> that punishing one and exempting another is not counter to the principle of: “One manner of law,” then by the same logic, in the case of <b>one who has a wound that will cause him to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>]</b> and <b>who killed a healthy person, what do we do to him?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> one must say that in a case <b>where it is possible</b> to render the guilty party liable according to the punishment listed in the Torah, it is <b>possible</b> and the court does so; but in a case <b>where it is not possible</b> to do so, it is <b>not possible, and we exempt him.</b> Therefore, the Gemara does not accept the derivation of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai, in accordance with the objection of the Sages.
The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught</b> that <b>the verse states:</b> “A fracture for a fracture, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth; as he has given a blemish to a person, <b>so shall it be given unto him”</b> (Leviticus 24:20), <b>and giving can</b> refer <b>only</b> to a payment of <b>money.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But if that is so,</b> then when the same verse states: <b>“As he has given [<i>yitten</i>] a blemish to a person,”</b> does <b>this</b> word, “<i>yitten</i>,” <b>also</b> refer <b>to money?</b> The word “<i>yitten</i>” means that he caused an actual injury, even though it employs a term whose literal meaning is give.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: The rabbis <b>of the school of Rabbi Yishmael are interpreting a superfluous verse. Now, it is written: “And if a man gives a blemish to his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him”</b> (Leviticus 24:19), so <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“So shall it be given unto him”</b> (Leviticus 24:20)? <b>Learn from</b> the repetition that the verse is referring to <b>monetary restitution.</b> The Gemara asks: But if this is so, <b>why do I</b> need the verse: <b>“As he has given [<i>yitten</i>] a blemish to a person”</b> (Leviticus 24:20)? What does the usage of the term “<i>yitten</i>” teach? The Gemara answers: In fact, it does not teach anything, but rather, <b>since</b> the Merciful One <b>needs to write</b> at the end of that verse: <b>“So shall it be given unto him,”</b> where the employment of a term of giving is accurate, the Merciful One <b>also wrote</b> earlier in the verse: <b>“As he has given [<i>yitten</i>] a blemish to a person.”</b>
The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>The school of Rabbi Ḥiyya taught</b> that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to conspiring witnesses: “And your eye shall not pity; a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, <b>a hand for a hand,</b> a foot for a foot” (Deuteronomy 19:21). This teaches that the witnesses pay compensation with <b>that which is given from hand to hand. And what</b> type of compensation <b>is that? Monetary restitution.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But if that is so, is</b> the phrase: <b>“A foot for a foot”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:21), <b>also like that,</b> i.e., is it teaching that the witnesses pay compensation with an item passed from foot to foot?
The Sages <b>say:</b> The rabbis of <b>the school of Rabbi Ḥiyya are interpreting a superfluous</b> phrase in the <b>verse. Now, it is written: “And you shall do to him as he purposed to do to his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19). <b>If it enters your mind</b> to say that the verse means this <b>literally, why do I</b> need the Torah to specify: <b>“A hand for a hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:21)? The punishment will be whatever he purported to do to his brother. <b>Learn from</b> the extra phrase that the punishment is <b>monetary restitution.</b> If so, <b>why do I</b> need the phrase: <b>“A foot for a foot”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:21)? <b>Since it is written: “A hand for a hand,”</b> the Merciful One <b>also wrote</b> in the Torah: <b>“A foot for a foot.”</b>
The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>Abaye says</b> that this principle is <b>derived from</b> that which <b>was taught</b> by <b>the school of Ḥizkiyya, as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught</b> that the Torah states: <b>“An eye for an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24), and: <b>“A life for a life”</b> (Exodus 21:23), <b>but not an eye and a life for an eye. And if it enters your mind</b> to say that the verse means this <b>literally,</b> there could be <b>times when you find</b> a case where both <b>an eye and a life</b> are taken <b>for an eye,</b> i.e., when the one who caused the damage is so weak <b>that as</b> the court <b>blinds</b> his eye, <b>his soul departs</b> from his body.
The Gemara objects: <b>And what</b> is <b>the difficulty? Perhaps we evaluate</b> the physical condition <b>of</b> the guilty party; <b>if he can withstand</b> this punishment, then <b>we do</b> blind his eye; <b>if he cannot withstand</b> this punishment, then <b>we do not</b> do so and he goes unpunished. <b>And if we evaluate</b> him and determine <b>that</b> he <b>can withstand</b> this punishment, <b>and we do so to him</b> and blind his eye, <b>and</b> yet <b>his soul departs</b> his body as a result, <b>if he dies, he will die. Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna <b>with regard to lashes</b> (<i>Makkot</i> 22b): If one was sentenced to be flogged, and the court <b>evaluated him</b> and determined that he could withstand a certain number of lashes, <b>and he dies at the hand</b> of the officer tasked with administering the lashes, then the officer is <b>exempt,</b> even though the one who was flogged was not sentenced to the death penalty? Therefore, the Gemara does not accept the derivation of Abaye.
The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rabba</b> that the <b>verse states: “A wound for a wound”</b> (Exodus 21:25), to teach that one who injures another must <b>pay</b> compensation for <b>pain,</b> even <b>in a case</b> where he pays compensation for <b>damage. And if it enters your mind</b> that the phrase: “An eye for an eye” (Exodus 21:24), refers to the removal of <b>an actual</b> eye from the one who injured the other, then <b>just as</b> it is so that the injured party <b>has pain</b> from the loss of his eye, the one who caused him injury <b>also has pain</b> when the court removes his eye; why then does the Torah require that he pay compensation for pain as well?
The Gemara objects: <b>And what</b> is <b>the difficulty? Perhaps there is a person who is delicate,</b> so <b>he has more pain, and there is a person who is not delicate,</b> so <b>he does not have</b> the same amount of <b>pain.</b> Therefore, even if the court actually removes an eye for an eye, the one who caused the injury might still need to compensate the injured party for pain. <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> when the Torah states: “A wound for a wound” (Exodus 21:25)? It renders the one who caused the injury liable <b>to give</b> the injured party compensation for <b>the difference between</b> them in pain tolerance. Therefore, the Gemara does not accept the derivation of Rav Zevid.
The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>Rav Pappa said in the name of Rava</b> that concerning one who was injured by another, who must pay for damage, the <b>verse states:</b> “If he rises again, and walks outside upon his staff, then he that struck him shall be absolved; only he shall pay for his loss of livelihood, <b>and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed”</b> (Exodus 21:19), which teaches that one who injures another must <b>pay</b> compensation for <b>medical costs</b> even <b>in a case</b> where he pays compensation for <b>damage. And if it enters your mind</b> that the phrase: “An eye for an eye” (Exodus 21:24), is referring to an <b>actual</b> eye, then <b>just as</b> it is so <b>that</b> the injured party <b>needs healing,</b> the one who caused him the injury <b>also needs healing</b> after the court removes his eye; why, then, does the Torah require that he pay compensation for medical costs as well?
The Gemara objects: <b>What</b> is <b>the difficulty? Perhaps there is</b> one <b>whose flesh heals quickly, and there is</b> another <b>whose flesh does not heal quickly.</b> Therefore, even if the court actually removes an eye for an eye, the one who caused the injury might still need to compensate the injured party for medical costs. <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> when the Torah states: “And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed” (Exodus 21:19)? It renders the one who caused the injury liable <b>to give</b> the injured party compensation for <b>the difference between</b> their respective medical costs.
The Gemara presents another derivation: <b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the fact that one who injures another pays monetary restitution <b>is derived</b> from a verbal analogy of the word <b>“for,”</b> as written with regard to injuries caused to people <b>from</b> the word <b>“for,”</b> as written with regard to <b>an ox</b> that gored another ox. <b>It is written here: “An eye for an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24), <b>and it is written there,</b> with regard to a forewarned ox that gored the ox of another: <b>“He shall pay an ox for an ox”</b> (Exodus 21:36). <b>Just as there,</b> the verse does not mean that the owner pays compensation with an actual ox, but rather pays <b>monetary restitution, so too here,</b> one who injures another pays <b>monetary restitution.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What did you see that</b> led <b>you</b> to <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> from a verbal analogy of the word <b>“for”</b> as stated in the verse with regard to injuries to a person <b>from</b> the word <b>“for”</b> as stated with regard to <b>an ox? Let us learn</b> a verbal analogy of the word <b>“for”</b> as stated in the verse with regard to injuries to a person <b>from</b> the word <b>“for”</b> as stated with regard to <b>a person, as it is written</b> about one who kills another: <b>“You shall give a life for a life”</b> (Exodus 21:23). <b>Just as there,</b> the court punishes the guilty party by taking his <b>actual</b> life, <b>so too here,</b> why not say that the court should take his <b>actual</b> eye?
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: The <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>damages is derived from</b> a verse concerning <b>damages, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>damages is not derived from</b> a verse concerning <b>death.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>On the contrary,</b> say that the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a person is derived from</b> a verse concerning <b>a person, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a person is not derived from</b> a verse concerning <b>animals.</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi</b> retracted his original statement and <b>said</b> a different derivation: The <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived from</b> a verbal analogy of the word “for” as written with regard to injuries from the word “for” as written with regard to a man who rapes a woman, who must pay monetary compensation. The verse states: “Then the man that lay with her shall give to the girl’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife, <b>for he has afflicted her;</b> he may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:29). Based on this verbal analogy, the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a person</b> is derived <b>from</b> a verse concerning <b>a person, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>damages</b> is derived <b>from</b> a verse concerning <b>damages.</b>
§ It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The verse that states: <b>“An eye for an eye”</b> (Exodus 21:24), is referring to <b>an actual</b> eye. The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that the verse is referring to <b>an actual</b> eye? <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Eliezer</b> understand the verse <b>like all these <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> who explained that this verse is referring to monetary payment?
<b>Rabba said</b> in response: Rabbi Eliezer means <b>to say that</b> the court <b>does not appraise</b> the injured party <b>as a slave</b> to assess the compensation for the injury. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>Rather, like whom</b> does the court appraise the injured party? If you say that the court appraises him <b>like a freeman, does a freeman have monetary</b> value? <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said:</b> Rabbi Eliezer means <b>to say that</b> the court <b>does not appraise the injured</b> party as if he were going to be sold as a slave, but <b>rather,</b> they appraise <b>the one who caused</b> him <b>damage.</b> The court appraises how much the latter’s value would be reduced were he to sustain the same injury he caused to the injured party, and he pays this amount as indemnity.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain donkey that severed the hand of a child.</b> The case <b>came before Rav Pappa bar Shmuel. He said</b> to the officers of the court: <b>Go appraise the four types</b> of indemnity <b>for</b> the child. <b>Rava said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that there are <b>five</b> types of indemnity? Rav Pappa bar Shmuel <b>said to him: I was saying</b> to include the indemnities the responsible party is liable to pay <b>other than damage. Abaye said to him: But</b> was <b>this</b> not <b>a donkey</b> that caused this injury, <b>and</b> the owner of <b>a donkey</b> that causes injury <b>pays only for</b> the <b>damage?</b> Rav Pappa bar Shmuel <b>said to</b> the officers of the court: <b>Go appraise for</b> the child the value of <b>his damage.</b> They said to him: <b>But</b> doesn’t the child <b>need to be appraised as a slave? He said to them: Go appraise him as a slave.</b>
<b>The father of the child said to them: I do not want</b> my child to be appraised as a slave, <b>because this matter</b> would <b>demean him. They said to</b> the father: <b>But</b> you are <b>acting to the detriment of the child,</b> as he will not receive compensation for his injury. <b>He said to them: When he matures, I will appease him with my own</b> money, rather than see him demeaned now.
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain ox that chewed [<i>da’alas</i>] the hand of a child,</b> injuring him. The case <b>came before Rava. He said to</b> the officers of the court: <b>Go appraise him as a slave. They said to</b> Rava: <b>But wasn’t it</b> you, <b>Master, who said:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who is appraised as a slave</b> in order to determine the amount of a monetary penalty, that penalty <b>is not collected</b> by courts <b>in Babylonia?</b> Rava <b>said to them:</b> It <b>is not necessary</b> to appraise his value in order to force the guilty party to pay restitution, but it is nevertheless necessary to determine his value. This is <b>because if</b> the injured party <b>seizes</b> property from the one who caused him injury, and that property is equal in value to what the payment should be, the court will not compel him to return it.
The Gemara notes: <b>Rava</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rava says:</b> Compensation for <b>damage</b> to <b>an ox</b> caused <b>by an ox and</b> for <b>damage</b> to <b>an ox</b> caused <b>by a person is collected</b> by courts <b>in Babylonia,</b> but compensation for <b>damage</b> to <b>a person</b> caused <b>by a person and</b> for <b>damage</b> to <b>a person</b> caused <b>by an ox is not collected</b> by courts <b>in Babylonia.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is different</b> about compensation for <b>damage</b> to <b>a person</b> caused <b>by a person and</b> for <b>damage</b> to <b>a person</b> caused <b>by an ox,</b> that it is <b>not</b> collected in Babylonia? If you say that <b>we require ordained judges</b> to collect damages, <b>and there are not</b> any ordained judges in Babylonia, then <b>so too,</b> in a case of <b>damage</b> caused by <b>an ox to an ox, and</b> damage caused by <b>a person to an ox,</b>

Daf 84b

say that <b>we require ordained judges [<i>elohim</i>] and there are not</b> any ordained judges in Babylonia.
<b>Rather, what is different</b> about damage to <b>an ox</b> caused <b>by an ox and</b> damage to <b>an ox</b> caused <b>by a man,</b> so that Babylonian judges can rule in these cases even though they are not ordained? The difference is <b>that we,</b> the judges of Babylonia, <b>perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael, <b>just as</b> we do <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>admissions and loans,</b> as we are permitted to rule in those cases as agents of the ordained judges in Eretz Yisrael. If so, then in cases of damage caused to <b>a person by a person and</b> cases of damage caused to <b>a person by an ox as well,</b> why not say that the judges of Babylonia <b>perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael, <b>just as it is with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>admissions and loans?</b>
The Sages <b>state,</b> with regard to the distinction: <b>When we,</b> the judges of Babylonia, <b>perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael, we do so <b>in matters where</b> the ruling <b>is clear to us;</b> but <b>in matters where</b> the ruling <b>is not clear to us,</b> such as in the case of an injury to a person, which requires an appraisal, <b>we do not perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael.
The Sages <b>state</b> an objection: In cases of damage caused to <b>an ox by an ox, and</b> damage caused to <b>an ox by a man,</b> cases that we do judge in Babylonia, the ruling <b>is also not clear to us,</b> as the damage must be appraised. <b>Rather,</b> how is the judgment assessed in those cases? We say: <b>Go out</b> and <b>see how</b> much <b>an ox is sold</b> for <b>in the marketplace,</b> and thereby assess the value of the damages, without a detailed appraisal. If so, in the case of damage caused to <b>a person by a person, and</b> damage caused to <b>a person by an ox,</b> say <b>too: Go out</b> and <b>see how a slave is sold in the</b> slave <b>market.</b> Why, then, are these latter cases not judged in Babylonia?
<b>And furthermore,</b> in the case of <b>payment of double</b> the principal incurred by a thief, <b>and</b> in the case of the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment</b> incurred by a thief who stole a sheep or ox and then slaughtered or sold the animal, <b>where</b> the payments <b>are fixed</b> and there is no need for an appraisal, <b>we should perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael.
The Sages <b>state,</b> with regard to the distinction: <b>When we perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael, we do so only <b>in</b> cases where the guilty party pays <b>monetary restitution</b> for a loss he caused. But <b>in</b> cases of <b>a penalty,</b> such as the double, fourfold, or fivefold payments of a thief, <b>we do not perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael.
The Gemara asks: In cases of damage caused to <b>a person by a person, where</b> the liable party pays <b>monetary restitution, should we perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers: <b>When we perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael, we do so only <b>in cases that are common.</b> Therefore, in cases of damage caused to <b>a person by a person,</b> cases <b>that are uncommon, we do not perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael.
The Gemara challenges: But accordingly, for indemnities paid to a woman for <b>humiliation and degradation</b> after being raped or seduced, a case <b>that is common, we should perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael. The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>Indeed,</b> we do collect compensation for humiliation and degradation in Babylonia, <b>as Rav Pappa collected four hundred dinars</b> as compensation <b>for humiliation</b> when he judged these cases. The Gemara questions this explanation: But the other Sages do <b>not</b> agree <b>with</b> that ruling <b>of Rav Pappa, as Rav Ḥisda sent</b> this question <b>to Rav Naḥman,</b> asking if he should collect compensation for humiliation and degradation, <b>and</b> Rav Naḥman <b>sent him</b> the following reply: <b>Ḥisda, Ḥisda, do you collect a penalty in Babylonia?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> explain the distinction this way: <b>When we perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael, we do so only <b>in a matter that is common and involves,</b> i.e., the payment is for, <b>a monetary loss. But in a matter that is common but does not involve a monetary loss, or in an uncommon matter which does involve a monetary loss, we do not perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael. <b>Therefore,</b> in a case of an injury caused to <b>a person by a person, even though it involves a monetary loss, since it is uncommon, we do not perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael. In a case of <b>humiliation, even though it is common, since it does not involve a monetary loss, we do not perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael.
The Gemara challenges the <i>halakha</i> itself: <b>But</b> is it in fact the case that the courts <b>in Babylonia collect</b> restitution for damage caused to <b>an ox by an ox? But doesn’t Rava say:</b> If <b>an ox caused damage,</b> the courts <b>in Babylonia do not collect</b> the compensation. The Gemara clarifies: To <b>whom</b> did the ox cause <b>damage? If we say that</b> it <b>damaged a person, why</b> did Rava <b>specifically</b> state his <i>halakha</i> in a case where there is <b>an ox that damaged a person? Even</b> in a case of <b>a person who damaged a person,</b> which is more common, the court <b>does not collect</b> the compensation <b>in Babylonia. Rather,</b> it <b>is obvious</b> that Rava meant that the ox <b>damaged an ox. And</b> Rava <b>teaches:</b> The court <b>does not collect</b> the compensation <b>in Babylonia.</b>
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>There,</b> Rava stated his ruling <b>with regard to an innocuous</b> ox, i.e., an ox that was not forewarned, whose owner pays for the damage as a penalty; and penalties are not collected in Babylonia. <b>Here,</b> Rava states his ruling <b>with regard to a forewarned</b> ox, and payment for damage it causes is not a penalty, but rather serves as compensation. The Gemara challenges: <b>But doesn’t Rava say: There are no forewarned</b> oxen <b>in Babylonia,</b> as an ox can be forewarned only by ordained judges? The Sages <b>say</b> in response: This is a case <b>where</b> an ox <b>was forewarned there,</b> in Eretz Yisrael, <b>and</b> then its owners <b>brought it here,</b> to Babylonia.
The Gemara objects: <b>But this is an uncommon matter,</b> as forewarned oxen are not frequently transported from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>an uncommon matter, did you not say that we do not perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael? The Gemara answers: This is a case <b>where the Rabbis from there,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, who are ordained, <b>came and declared</b> this ox <b>forewarned, here,</b> i.e., in Babylonia. The Gemara challenges this interpretation: <b>Ultimately, this</b> is <b>an uncommon matter, and you say</b> that with regard to <b>an uncommon matter</b> that <b>we do not perform the agency of</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael.
<b>Rather,</b> explain that <b>when Rava says</b> that courts in Babylonia collect restitution for damage caused by an ox, he means <b>with regard to</b> damage in the categories of <b>Eating and Trampling, which are forewarned from the outset.</b> All agree that since these are common forms of damage and involve monetary loss, the judges of Babylonia perform the agency of the judges of Eretz Yisrael and collect compensation for the damage.
§ The Gemara returns to its discussion of the mishna, which states: How is payment for <b>pain</b> assessed? If <b>one burned</b> another <b>with a skewer or with a</b> hot <b>nail,</b> or even if he burned him on his fingernail, where he would not cause a bruise that would affect the victim’s value on the slave market, the court evaluates how much money a person with a similar threshold for pain as the victim is willing to take in order to be made to suffer in this way. The Gemara comments: This teaches that even when the <b>pain</b> is <b>not in a place</b> that causes <b>damage</b> to the injured party, the one who caused the injury must <b>pay</b> compensation. The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> this statement? <b>Rava said: This is</b> the opinion of <b>ben Azzai, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the verse: “<i>Keviyya</i> for <i>keviyya</i>, a wound for a wound, <i>ḥabura</i> for <i>ḥabura</i>” (Exodus 21:25), <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: A burn [<i>keviyya</i>] is the first</b> term <b>stated</b> in the verse, and <b>ben Azzai says: A bruise [<i>ḥabura</i>] is the first</b> term <b>stated</b> in the verse.
The Gemara explains the <i>baraita</i>: Ben Azzai certainly agrees that the first term in the verse, “<i>keviyya</i>,” means a burn. <b>With regard to what do they disagree? Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds that “<i>keviyya</i>” indicates</b> an injury <b>with no bruise,</b> and that one would be liable to pay for injuring another even in that manner; therefore, when <b>the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah: <b>“<i>Ḥabura</i>,”</b> it is <b>to reveal about</b> the meaning <b>of “<i>keviyya</i>”</b> that if the burn also <b>has a bruise,</b> then <b>yes,</b> the one who caused the injury must pay compensation for pain; but <b>if</b> the burn has <b>no</b> bruise, then <b>no,</b> the one who caused the injury does not pay compensation for pain alone.
<b>And ben Azzai holds</b> that <b>“<i>keviyya</i>” indicates</b> a burn <b>that</b> also <b>has a bruise,</b> and that one would be liable to pay for injuring another only in that manner; therefore, when <b>the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah: <b>“<i>Ḥabura</i>,”</b> it is <b>to reveal about</b> the meaning <b>of “<i>keviyya</i>”</b> that even if it is a burn <b>with no bruise,</b> the one who caused the injury must pay compensation for pain alone, even though there is no damage.
<b>Rav Pappa objects to</b> Rava’s explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>On the contrary, the opposite stands to reason,</b> as <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: A burn [<i>keviyya</i>] is the first</b> term <b>stated</b> in the verse, since <b>he holds</b> that <b>“<i>keviyya</i>” indicates</b> a burn <b>that</b> also <b>has a bruise,</b> and one would be liable to pay for injuring another only in that manner. Therefore, when <b>the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah: <b>“<i>Ḥabura</i>,”</b> it is <b>to reveal about</b> the meaning <b>of “<i>keviyya</i>”</b> that even if it is a burn <b>with no bruise,</b> the one who caused the injury must pay compensation for pain alone, even though there is no damage.
Rav Pappa continues: And <b>ben Azzai says</b> that <b>a bruise [<i>ḥabura</i>] is the first</b> term <b>stated</b> in the verse, as <b>he holds</b> that <b>“<i>keviyya</i>” indicates</b> an injury <b>with no bruise,</b> and that one would be liable to pay for injuring another even in that manner. Therefore, when <b>the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah: <b>“<i>Ḥabura</i>,”</b> it is <b>to reveal about</b> the meaning <b>of “<i>keviyya</i>”</b> that if the burn also <b>has a bruise,</b> then <b>yes,</b> the one who caused the injury must pay compensation for pain; but <b>if</b> the burn has <b>no</b> bruise, then <b>no,</b> the one who caused the injury does not pay compensation for pain alone. <b>And</b> according to this explanation, the statements of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and ben Azzai with regard to the meaning of the terms in the verse are <b>based on</b> their <b>final understanding</b> of the verse. The term: The first term stated, is referring to the understanding of the first term after the second term has been written, not what the understanding of the first term would have been if not for the addition of the second term. According to the explanation of Rav Pappa, the mishna here is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.
The Gemara offers another explanation of the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and ben Azzai: <b>Alternatively, everyone</b> agrees is that <b>“<i>keviyya</i>” indicates</b> an injury <b>whether there is a bruise or whether there is not a bruise. And here,</b>

Daf 85a

Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and ben Azzai <b>disagree</b> over whether the hermeneutical principle of a generalization and a detail is applied <b>with regard to a generalization and a detail that are distant from each other.</b> When a generalization is followed by a detail, the <i>halakha</i> applies only in the case specified in the detail. The verse states: “<i>Keviyya</i> for <i>keviyya</i>, a wound for a wound, <i>ḥabura</i> for <i>ḥabura</i>” (Exodus 21:25). The word “<i>keviyya</i>,” as stated in the beginning of the verse, is a generalization that includes burns not accompanied by bruises as well as burns accompanied by bruises. “<i>Ḥabura</i>,” as stated at the end of the verse, is a detail of a burn that is accompanied by a bruise. The Torah distances the detail, “<i>ḥabura</i>,” from the generalization, “<i>keviyya</i>,” by stating the <i>halakha</i> of: “A wound for a wound” between them.
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that since there is an intervening phrase between the generalization and the detail, one <b>does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> from the verse concerning burns and bruises by <b>employing</b> the principle of <b>a generalization and a detail.</b> Therefore, the one who caused the injury is liable to pay compensation for pain in all cases of burns, even those that are not accompanied by bruises. <b>And ben Azzai holds</b> that one <b>does derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> from the verse concerning burns and bruises by <b>employing</b> the principle of <b>a generalization and a detail,</b> and therefore the one who caused the injury is liable to pay compensation for pain only if the burn is accompanied by a bruise. <b>And if you would say: According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>why do I</b> need the Torah to state the <i>halakha</i> of <b>“<i>ḥabura</i></b> for <i>ḥabura</i>,” as that is included as a subset of “<i>keviyya</i>”? The phrase mentioning “<i>ḥabura</i>” is necessary <b>to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> of <b>additional money,</b> i.e., in a case where someone caused a burn with a bruise, he pays additional compensation for the bruise beyond that for the burn.
§ The mishna teaches: How is the payment for pain assessed? The court <b>evaluates how much</b> money <b>a person</b> with <b>a similar</b> threshold for pain <b>as</b> the victim <b>is willing to take</b> in order to be made to suffer in this way. The one who burned the victim must then pay this amount. The Gemara asks: <b>How do we appraise pain in a case</b> where the injured party also suffered personal <b>injury?</b>
<b>Shmuel’s father says:</b> The court <b>evaluates how much</b> money <b>a person is willing to take</b> to allow someone <b>to sever his hand.</b> The Gemara objects: Do you really mean <b>to sever his hand?</b> Wouldn’t this evaluation <b>be not just for pain, but</b> to <b>include all five types</b> of indemnity? <b>Moreover, are we dealing with fools,</b> who would accept money to have their hands severed? The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the court evaluates how much money a person would accept to allow someone <b>to sever his</b> already <b>severed hand,</b> which is of no use. The Gemara objects: In the case of <b>his severed hand also, there is not pain alone, but there is</b> both <b>pain and humiliation, because it is an embarrassing matter for him</b> if someone were <b>to take</b> a part <b>of his flesh to throw it to dogs.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the court <b>evaluates how much a person is willing to take</b> to allow someone <b>to sever his hand, which is</b> already condemned by <b>a written</b> decree <b>from the government</b> to be severed, changing the decree <b>from</b> having it severed by means of <b>a drug,</b> which is not accompanied by pain, <b>to</b> having it severed by means of <b>a sword,</b> which is accompanied by pain. The amount of money he would accept to have his hand severed by a sword instead of by the drug is his compensation. The Sages <b>say</b> in objection: <b>Here too,</b> one would <b>not take</b> money <b>and cause himself pain</b> in this way, so there is no indemnity to evaluate.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> the court <b>evaluates how much a person would give to</b> have someone <b>sever his hand, which is</b> already <b>condemned</b> by <b>a written</b> decree <b>from the government</b> to be severed, changing the decree <b>from</b> having it be severed by means of <b>a sword,</b> which is accompanied by pain, <b>to</b> having it be severed by means of <b>a drug,</b> which is not accompanied by pain.
The Gemara objects: If this is the case, then <b>this</b> wording of the mishna: <b>To take,</b> is imprecise; <b>it should have</b> said: <b>To give. Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> The mishna means that the court evaluates how much <b>this</b> one, the injured party, <b>will take from that</b> one, i.e., the one who caused the injury, based on <b>what this</b> man, the injured party, would have <b>given</b> to the government to have his hand severed by a drug rather than with a sword.
§ The mishna teaches: How is payment for <b>medical costs</b> assessed? If one <b>struck</b> another, then he is <b>liable to heal him</b> by paying for his medical costs. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:4): If <b>growths appeared on</b> the injured area <b>due to the injury, and the wound reopened,</b> then the one who caused the injury is again <b>liable to heal him</b> by covering his medical costs, <b>and is liable to give him the value of his loss of livelihood</b> while he recovers from the reopened wound. But if the growths that appeared <b>are not due to the injury, he is not liable to heal him</b> by covering his medical costs, <b>and he is not liable to give him the value of his loss of livelihood.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>even</b> if the growths appeared <b>due to the injury, he is liable to heal him</b> by covering his medical costs, <b>but he is not liable to give him the</b> value <b>of his loss of livelihood. And the Rabbis say:</b> The one who caused the injury is not liable at all, because the Torah states the <i>halakhot</i> of compensation for <b>his loss of livelihood and his medical costs</b> together. This teaches that <b>anyone who is liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for loss of livelihood is</b> also <b>liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for medical costs, and</b> anyone <b>who is not liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for loss of livelihood is</b> also <b>not liable to</b> pay compensation <b>for medical costs.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do they disagree? Rabba said: I found the Sages in the study hall of Rav when they were sitting and were stating</b> an explanation: <b>Here,</b> Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis <b>disagree about</b> whether <b>a wound may be</b> wrapped in a <b>bandage,</b> i.e., whether one is permitted to bandage his wound to lessen the pain, at the risk of causing damaging side effects.
Rabba explains: <b>The Rabbis,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>hold</b> that <b>a wound may be</b> wrapped <b>in a bandage.</b> Consequently, if the bandage causes side effects which lead the injured party to incur additional medical expenses, those expenses are considered to have resulted from the original injury. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>a wound may not be</b> wrapped <b>in a bandage.</b> Therefore, with regard to <b>medical costs,</b> about <b>which the verse repeated</b> the obligation to pay them, by stating: “And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed [<i>verappo yerappe</i>]” (Exodus 21:19), the one who caused the injury <b>is liable</b> to pay compensation. But for <b>loss of livelihood,</b> about <b>which the verse did not repeat</b> the obligation to pay it, the one who caused the injury <b>is not liable</b> to pay compensation.
Rabba continues: <b>And I said to them</b> that <b>if</b> Rabbi Yehuda were to hold that <b>a wound may not be</b> wrapped <b>in a bandage,</b> then the one who caused the injury should <b>also not be liable</b> to pay compensation for <b>medical costs,</b> as he is not liable to compensate the injured party for damage resulting from his own irresponsible behavior. <b>Rather,</b> the disagreement is as follows: <b>Everyone</b> agrees that <b>a wound may be</b> wrapped <b>in a bandage, but may not be</b> wrapped <b>in an excessive bandage.</b>
He explains the dispute: <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>since</b> a wound <b>may not be</b> wrapped <b>in an excessive bandage,</b> then with regard to <b>medical costs,</b> about <b>which the verse repeated</b> the obligation to pay them, by stating: “<i>Verappo yerappe</i>” (Exodus 21:19), the one who caused the injury <b>is liable</b> to pay compensation. But for <b>loss of livelihood,</b> about <b>which the verse did not repeat</b> the obligation to pay, the one who caused the injury <b>is not liable</b> to pay compensation. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>hold: Since the verse repeated</b> the obligation to pay compensation <b>for medical costs, one is also liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for loss of livelihood, which is juxtaposed to</b> the obligation to pay for <b>medical costs,</b> as the verse states: “Only he shall pay for the loss of his time, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.”
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that even though medical costs and loss of livelihood are juxtaposed, the one who caused the injury is <b>not liable</b> to pay compensation for <b>loss of livelihood</b> in this case, <b>because the Merciful One restricted it</b> in the Torah, as the verse states: <b>“Only</b> he shall pay for his loss of livelihood, and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed” (Exodus 21:19). “Only” is a restricting term. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who hold that one must pay for loss of livelihood in this case as well, hold that the word <b>“only” is coming</b> to exclude growths <b>that were not due to the injury,</b> with regard to which the one who caused the injury is exempt from liability.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according <b>to</b> the opinion of <b>the latter Rabbis</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>who say: Anyone who is liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for loss of livelihood is liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for medical costs, and anyone who is not liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for loss of livelihood is not liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for medical costs, why do I</b> need, i.e., how do I account for, the fact <b>that the verse repeated</b> the obligation to pay <b>medical costs?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is necessary for that which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> When the verse states: <b>“And shall cause him to be thoroughly healed [<i>verappo yerappe</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:19), it is derived <b>from here that permission is granted to a doctor to heal,</b> and it is not considered to be an intervention counter to the will of God.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if growths appeared due to the injury, and the wound reopened,</b> then the one who caused the injury is again <b>liable to heal him</b> by covering his medical costs, <b>and is liable to give him</b> the value <b>of his loss of livelihood</b> while he recovers from the reopened wound? <b>The verse states: “And he shall cause him to be thoroughly healed”</b> (Exodus 21:19). One <b>might</b> have thought that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if the growths <b>were not due to the injury.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Only</b> he shall pay for his loss of livelihood,” in order to exclude this case. This is in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> in the previous <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: Even</b> if the growths appeared <b>due to the injury,</b> the one who caused the injury is <b>exempt, as it is stated: “Only.”</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: <b>Even</b> if the growths appeared <b>due to the injury,</b> the one who caused the injury is <b>completely exempt</b> from paying compensation, both for medical costs and loss of livelihood. And this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the latter Rabbis</b> in the previous <i>baraita</i>. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rabbi Yosei bar Yehuda says: <b>Even</b> if the growths appeared <b>due to the injury,</b> the one who caused the injury is <b>exempt from</b> paying compensation for <b>loss of livelihood, but is liable</b> to pay compensation <b>for medical costs. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this statement? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>his father,</b> Rabbi Yehuda.
The Gemara analyzes the statement of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said:</b> One <b>might</b> have thought that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if the growths <b>were not due to the injury.</b> Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Only</b> he shall pay for his loss of livelihood,” to teach that he is exempt in this case. The Gemara asks: <b>Is there a need</b> for the <b>verse</b> to teach that he is exempt in the case of growths <b>that were not due to the injury?</b>
The Sages <b>say: What</b> did the <i>baraita</i> mean when it said that the growths <b>were not due to the injury? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who violated</b> his <b>doctor’s instructions and ate honey or any type of sweet</b> food, which the doctor had instructed him not to eat <b>because</b> of the fact <b>that honey or any type of sweet</b> foods <b>are detrimental to</b> the recovery from <b>the injury; and his injury developed <i>garguteni</i>;</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that the one who caused the injury <b>should be liable to heal him</b> by covering his medical costs. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Only,”</b> to teach that he is exempt in this case. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>garguteni</i>? Abaye said: Necrosis. What is its remedy? Crystalline ice plant, and wax, and wine dregs.</b>
§ The Gemara presents several <i>halakhot</i> concerning compensation for medical costs: <b>And if</b> the one who caused the injury <b>says to</b> the injured party: <b>I will heal you</b> myself, as I am a doctor; the injured party may <b>say to him: You are to me as a predatory lion,</b> in that I fear you and do not trust you to heal me. <b>And if</b> the one who caused the injury <b>says to</b> the injured party: <b>I will bring a doctor who heals for no cost,</b> so that I will not need to pay for your medical costs; the injured party may <b>say to him: A doctor who heals for no cost</b> is <b>worth nothing.</b>
<b>And if</b> the one who caused the injury <b>says to</b> the injured party: <b>I will bring you a doctor</b> from <b>a distant</b> place, the injured party may <b>say to him: A doctor</b> from <b>a distant</b> place <b>blinds the eye.</b> A local doctor has an incentive to ensure that the patient fully heals, while a doctor from a distant place has no incentive to monitor the patient once he has received his fee.
<b>And if that one,</b> the injured party, <b>says to</b> the one who caused him injury: <b>Give</b> the money <b>to me and I will</b> take responsibility for <b>healing myself;</b> the one who caused him the injury may <b>say to him: You will be negligent with yourself and you will take more from me</b> than was originally necessary. <b>And if</b> the injured party <b>says to</b> the one who caused him injury: <b>Settle a fixed</b> sum <b>for me</b> to cover my medical costs, and I will take care of my own recovery; the one who caused him the injury may <b>say to him: All the more so</b> with this proposal is there a concern <b>that you will be negligent with yourself,</b> as you will wish to profit and you will not spend the money on your recovery, <b>and</b> people <b>will call me: An ox that causes damage,</b> because I caused an injury from which you did not recover.
§ With regard to compensation for pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And all of these</b> types of indemnity <b>are paid in a case</b> where the one who caused injury must also pay compensation for <b>damage.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava: The verse states: “A wound for a wound”</b> (Exodus 21:25), to teach that the one who caused injury is liable <b>to give</b> compensation for <b>pain in a case of damage.</b>
The Gemara asks: But isn’t <b>this</b> verse <b>necessary</b> to teach an additional <i>halakha</i>:

Daf 85b

This serves <b>to include</b> in the category of those liable to pay compensation one who causes injury <b>unwittingly just as</b> one who causes injury <b>intentionally</b> is liable, <b>and</b> one who causes injury <b>due to circumstances beyond his control just as</b> one who causes injury <b>willingly.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> and the verse teaches only this, <b>let the verse write</b> the more succinct phrase: <b>A wound [<i>petza</i>] for a wound [<i>befatza</i>]; what</b> is taught by the expanded phrase: <b>“A wound [<i>petza</i>] for a wound [<i>taḥat patza</i>]”? Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from</b> the verse, that the one who caused the injury is liable to pay compensation regardless of how he caused the injury, and that he must pay compensation for pain in addition to compensation for damage.
With regard to compensation for medical costs in a case where one pays compensation for damage, <b>Rav Pappa said in the name of Rava</b> that the <b>verse states: “He shall cause him to be thoroughly healed [<i>verappo yerappe</i>]”</b> (Exodus 21:19), and the doubled term teaches that the one who caused the injury is liable <b>to give</b> monetary compensation for <b>medical costs in a case of</b> compensation for <b>damage.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>This</b> verse is <b>necessary for</b> teaching a different <i>halakha</i>, <b>that which the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught. As the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught:</b> When the verse states: <b>“<i>Verappo yerappe</i>,” from here</b> it is derived <b>that permission is granted to a doctor to heal.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the verse write: <i>Verofeh yerappe</i>,</b> meaning: And a doctor shall heal. <b>Learn from</b> the phrase employed that the one who caused the injury is liable <b>to give</b> monetary compensation for <b>medical costs in a case of damage.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> it is <b>still necessary for</b> the <i>halakhot</i> <b>that we stated</b> previously, i.e., it was necessary <b>for the verse to repeat</b> the language <b>of healing,</b> as the Gemara explained. The Gemara answers: <b>If so, let the verse say</b> one of the two words twice, <b>either: <i>Rappo rappo</i>, or: <i>Yerappe yerappe</i>. What</b> is taught by repeating the language with a change: <b>“<i>Verappo yerappe</i>”? Learn from</b> this wording that the one who caused the injury is liable <b>to give</b> monetary compensation for <b>medical costs in a case of damage.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> stated that compensation for pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation are paid even where the one who caused the injury pays compensation for damage. The Gemara notes: <b>By inference,</b> it must be <b>that you find these</b> examples of cases where the one who caused an injury must pay compensation for these indemnities <b>that are not in a case of damage.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>How</b> would <b>you find</b> examples of <b>these</b> cases <b>that are not in a case of damage?</b>
The Gemara answers: An example of a case where one must pay compensation for <b>pain</b> alone is <b>as that</b> which the mishna <b>teaches</b> explicitly: How is payment for <b>pain</b> assessed? If <b>he burned</b> another <b>with a skewer or with a</b> hot <b>nail, or even</b> if he burned him <b>on his fingernail,</b> which is <b>a place where he does not cause a bruise,</b> i.e., there was no personal injury, only pain, the court evaluates the monetary value of the pain. An example of a case where one must pay compensation for <b>medical costs</b> alone is <b>where some</b> body part <b>was hurting and</b> another <b>came and brought him a strong drug, and it whitened his flesh;</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that</b> the second person <b>must give him</b> another <b>drug to restore the color to his flesh,</b> even though he caused no damage, i.e., loss of function.
An example of a case where one must pay compensation for <b>loss of livelihood</b> alone is a case of one <b>who locked</b> another <b>in a room [<i>be’inderona</i>] and forced him to be idle,</b> but did not cause him any personal injury. An example of a case where one must pay compensation for <b>humiliation</b> alone is a case of one <b>who spit in the face of</b> another, without causing any personal injury.
§ The mishna teaches: How is payment for <b>loss of livelihood</b> assessed? The court <b>views</b> the injured party <b>as though he were a watchman of cucumbers. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:2): How is payment for <b>loss of livelihood</b> assessed? The court <b>views</b> the injured party <b>as though he were a watchman of cucumbers. And if you say:</b> But <b>the standard of justice was compromised.</b> The Gemara interjects to clarify this statement of the <i>baraita</i>: It appears to be compromised, <b>as when this man will recover, he</b> will <b>not collect the wage of a watchman of cucumbers,</b> but <b>rather</b> he will <b>carry buckets and collect</b> a higher <b>wage, or</b> he will <b>travel as an agent and collect</b> an even higher <b>wage.</b> The assessment of loss of livelihood should also account for one of these types of labor.
The Gemara returns to quoting the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The standard of justice was not compromised, because</b> the one who caused him injury <b>already gave him the value of his hand or the value of his leg,</b> and that compensation took into account the professional opportunities he lost due to the injury.
<b>Rava says:</b> If one <b>severed the hand of</b> another, <b>he gives him the value of his hand</b> as compensation for damage, <b>and</b> for <b>loss of livelihood</b> the court <b>views</b> the injured party <b>as though he were a watchman of cucumbers.</b> If one <b>broke the leg of</b> another, <b>he gives him the value of his leg</b> as compensation for damage. <b>And</b> for <b>loss of livelihood</b> the court <b>views</b> the injured party <b>as though he were a watchman at the opening</b> to a courtyard, because he cannot work even as a watchman of cucumbers, as that requires walking around the cucumber field.
Rava continues: If one <b>blinded the eye of</b> another, <b>he gives him the</b> value <b>of his eye</b> as compensation for damage; <b>and</b> as for <b>loss of livelihood,</b> the court <b>views</b> the injured party <b>as though</b> the one who caused the injury <b>caused him to grind with a mill,</b> as even a blind person can do this. If one <b>deafened</b> another, <b>he gives him his entire value</b> as compensation for damage, because one lacking the ability to hear is not fit for any form of employment.
§ <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>severed the hand</b> of another, <b>and</b> the court <b>did not</b> yet <b>evaluate him</b> to determine the compensation, and then he <b>broke his leg, and</b> the court <b>did not</b> yet <b>evaluate him</b> for this additional injury, and then he <b>blinded his eye, and</b> the court <b>did not</b> yet <b>evaluate him</b> for this further injury; <b>and ultimately</b> he <b>deafened him, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say: Since</b> the court <b>did not evaluate him</b> each time, <b>one evaluation is sufficient for</b> the court to determine his compensation, <b>and</b> the one who caused him injury must <b>give him his entire value at once,</b> as that is the compensation for deafening him? <b>Or perhaps</b> we say: <b>We evaluate</b> each injury <b>one by one, and we</b> obligate the one who caused him injury to <b>give him</b> compensation for each.
Rava explains the dilemma: <b>The difference is</b> with regard to <b>whether</b> the one who caused the injury <b>must give him</b> monetary compensation for <b>pain and humiliation for each and every one</b> of the injuries. <b>Although he does not give him</b> monetary compensation <b>for damage, medical costs, and loss of livelihood for each and every one</b> of the injuries, <b>since,</b> ultimately, <b>he is giving him his entire value</b> after deafening him, <b>he is like someone who killed him, and therefore he gives him his entire value</b> and no more; <b>in any event,</b> must he <b>give</b> compensation for <b>pain and humiliation for each and every one</b> of the injuries, <b>as</b> the injured party <b>had pain and humiliation</b> each time?
Rava continues: <b>And if you say</b> as a resolution to this dilemma that <b>since</b> the fact is <b>that</b> the court <b>had not evaluated him</b> after each injury, the one who caused him injury <b>pays him his entire value all together,</b> then there is another dilemma: If the court <b>had evaluated him</b> after each injury but the one who caused the injury had not paid the compensation before he deafened him, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say: Since</b> it is so that the court <b>evaluated him,</b> the one who caused him injury <b>is required to give him</b> the compensation for <b>each and every one</b> of the injuries? <b>Or perhaps, since</b> the one who caused him injury <b>had not</b> yet <b>paid</b> those compensations before deafening him, <b>he</b> must <b>give him his entire value.</b> The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rabba raises a dilemma:</b> If one injured another, causing him <b>loss of livelihood that diminishes his monetary</b> value, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this case? <b>For example,</b> in a case <b>where he struck him on his hand and his hand became weakened</b> so that he could not work, <b>but</b> his hand <b>will ultimately return</b> to its original health, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Should one say: <b>Since</b> his hand <b>will ultimately return</b> to its original health, <b>he does not need to give him any</b> compensation <b>whatsoever</b> for the damage? <b>Or perhaps, in any event, he has diminished</b> his value for <b>now.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from a mishna (87a): <b>One who strikes his father or his mother and did not cause them</b> to have <b>a bruise,</b> and who therefore is not liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, which is the penalty for one who causes his parent a bruise, <b>and one who injures another on Yom Kippur,</b> and therefore is liable for excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>] and not liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment,

Daf 86a

is <b>liable to</b> pay <b>all of</b> the five types of indemnity.
The Gemara explains: In <b>this</b> case of one who injured his parent but <b>did not bruise him, what are the circumstances?</b> Is it <b>not</b> a case <b>where he struck him on his hand, and it will eventually return</b> to its original health? <b>And</b> with regard to this case that mishna <b>teaches:</b> He is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>all of</b> the five types of indemnity. If so, this resolves Rabba’s dilemma.
The Sages object and <b>say: Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where he deafened</b> his parent by striking him, <b>but did not bruise him.</b> Since his father’s hearing loss is permanent, he is liable to pay all five types of indemnity, and this is not relevant to Rabba’s dilemma. The Gemara objects: <b>But doesn’t Rabba</b> himself <b>say: One who deafens his father is executed,</b> even though no bruise is visible, <b>because it is impossible for deafening</b> to occur <b>without a bruise?</b> It is certain that <b>a drop of blood fell into his ear</b> from the blow, even if it is not visible from the outside.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where he shaved his</b> father’s hair without causing a bruise. In a case where <b>he shaved him,</b> his hair <b>will return, and this is</b> an example of <b>our dilemma,</b> i.e., of an injury to a limb that will return to its original health. If so, this resolves Rabba’s dilemma.
The Sages object and <b>say:</b> It is possible that <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where he smeared</b> his father with a <b>depilatory</b> agent <b>[<i>nasha</i>]</b> that caused his hair to fall out, so <b>that</b> his hair <b>will not return.</b>
The Gemara explains how one could be liable for each of the five types of indemnity by smearing a depilatory agent: The father experiences <b>pain</b> in a case <b>where he has fissures on his head and has pain from those fissures.</b> He incurs <b>medical costs because he requires healing</b> for the fissures. He incurs <b>loss of livelihood</b> in a case <b>where he would dance in taverns</b> to earn money, <b>which requires</b> him to <b>make various gestures with his head</b> and his hair while dancing; <b>and</b> now <b>he cannot gesture</b> because <b>of those fissures</b> on his head. He experiences <b>humiliation,</b> because <b>there is no humiliation greater than</b> losing one’s hair.
The Gemara comments: <b>And the matter that is a dilemma for Rabba is obvious to Abaye on this side</b> of the dilemma, <b>and to Rava on that side</b> of the dilemma; they each resolved the dilemma but with opposing conclusions. <b>As it was stated:</b> If one <b>struck</b> another <b>on his hand and</b> the hand was <b>weakened, but it will ultimately return</b> to its original health, <b>Abaye says: He gives him</b> compensation for his <b>major loss of livelihood,</b> i.e., the decrease in his value, due to his temporary paralysis, as measured by his price on the slave market; <b>and</b> his <b>minor loss of livelihood,</b> i.e., the money he would have earned while idle during his recovery. <b>And Rava says: He gives him only the value of his loss of livelihood for each and every day,</b> and he does not give him the full value of his hand.
§ The Gemara presents another dispute between Abaye and Rava. It <b>was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who severs the hand of a Hebrew slave</b> who <b>belongs to another, Abaye says: He gives</b> compensation for the <b>major loss of livelihood to the slave, and</b> compensation for the <b>minor loss of livelihood to the master. Rava says: All</b> the compensation <b>shall be given to the slave, and land shall be purchased with</b> the money; <b>and the master garners the profits</b> from the land for the duration of the slave’s term of slavery.
The Gemara comments: It is <b>obvious</b> that if one injured a slave and thereby <b>reduced</b> the slave’s value <b>for</b> the slave <b>himself, but he did not reduce</b> the slave’s value <b>for his master;</b> the Gemara interjects: <b>What are the circumstances</b> where this is possible? This is possible in a case <b>where he split the tip of his ear or the tip of his nostril,</b> which does not impact the slave’s ability to perform labor. The Gemara returns to continue the statement: In such a case, <b>all</b> of the compensation goes <b>to</b> the slave <b>himself.</b> If the injury <b>reduced</b> the slave’s value <b>for his master,</b> then this is the case of <b>the dispute of Abaye and Rava.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: How is payment for <b>humiliation</b> assessed? <b>It all depends on</b> the stature of <b>the one who humiliates</b> the other <b>and the one who is humiliated.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in <b>the mishna?</b> It is <b>not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and</b> it is <b>not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. Rather, it is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
These opinions are <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> in <b>all of those</b> cases of Jews who were humiliated, regardless of their individual stature, <b>they are viewed as though they were freemen who lost their property</b> and were impoverished, and their humiliation is calculated according to this status, <b>as they are the sons of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</b> and are all of prominent lineage. Humiliation is assessed according to a standard formula, regardless of who was humiliated. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The court views each person according to his stature, <b>the great</b> person <b>according to his greatness, and the small</b> person <b>according to his smallness. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> In a case of <b>wealthy</b> people, the court <b>views them as though they were freemen who lost their property;</b> in a case of <b>poor</b> people, the court views them <b>as the least among</b> the poor. This lessens the payment of compensation for the one who caused humiliation.
The Gemara explains: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in the mishna? <b>Now, if</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, the mishna teaches: It all depends on</b> the stature of <b>the one who humiliates</b> the other <b>and the one who is humiliated, and Rabbi Meir</b> holds in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>all of those</b> who were humiliated <b>are</b> considered alike to <b>one another. And if</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, a mishna teaches</b> (86b): <b>One who humiliates a blind person is liable, whereas Rabbi Yehuda says</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A blind person does not have humiliation. Rather, is</b> the opinion expressed in the mishna <b>not</b> that of <b>Rabbi Shimon?</b>
The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the mishna expresses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda. When Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>a blind person does not have humiliation,</b> he meant <b>with regard to</b> another <b>taking</b> compensation for humiliation <b>from him.</b> A blind person is not fully aware of what he does, and one can be rendered liable for causing humiliation only if he intended to humiliate the other. <b>But with regard to giving him</b> compensation for humiliation, <b>he is given</b> compensation.
The Gemara challenges this explanation of the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda: <b>But from the fact that</b> the <b>latter clause</b> of that mishna <b>teaches</b> that <b>one who humiliates a sleeping person</b> is <b>liable but a sleeping person who humiliates</b> another is <b>exempt, and does not teach</b> that <b>a blind person who humiliates</b> another is <b>exempt, by inference,</b> the mishna teaches that there is <b>no difference this</b> way, <b>and no difference that</b> way; whether a blind person humiliates another or is humiliated, the one who causes humiliation is liable to pay compensation. <b>Rather, it is clear</b> that <b>the mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
§ The Gemara analyzes a related <i>baraita</i> in light of the three opinions cited earlier. <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught this</b> <i>baraita</i>, <b>as the Sages taught:</b> If one <b>intended to humiliate a small</b> man <b>[<i>katan</i>] and</b> instead <b>humiliated a great</b> man <b>[<i>gadol</i>]</b>, <b>he gives the money</b> he would have owed <b>for the small</b> man’s <b>humiliation to the great</b> man. If one <b>intended to humiliate a slave and</b> instead <b>humiliated a freeman, he gives the money</b> he would have owed <b>for the slave’s humiliation to the freeman. Whose</b> opinion is this? It is <b>not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
The Gemara explains why this is not in accordance with the opinion of any of these <i>tanna’im</i>: It <b>enters your mind</b> to say that when the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a <i>katan</i>,</b> it means that he is <b>small in</b> terms of his <b>property,</b> i.e., he is poor; and when the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a <i>gadol</i>,</b> it means that he is <b>great in</b> terms of his <b>property,</b> i.e., he is wealthy. <b>If</b> this <i>baraita</i> is stating the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, doesn’t he say</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>all of those</b> who were humiliated <b>are</b> considered similar to <b>one another? And if</b> it is stating the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, doesn’t he say: Slaves have no humiliation;</b> whereas the <i>baraita</i> discusses the compensation owed to a slave. <b>And if</b> it is stating the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, doesn’t he say:</b> If one <b>intended to humiliate this</b> one, <b>and</b> instead <b>humiliated that</b> one, he is <b>exempt?</b>
The Gemara explains Rabbi Shimon’s statement: <b>What is the reason</b> for exempting one who humiliated a person whom he did not intend to humiliate? The <i>halakha</i> of humiliation is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>killing. Just as</b> in a case of <b>killing,</b> the murderer is not executed <b>unless he intended</b> to kill the victim specifically, <b>as it is written: “And he lies in wait for him, and rises up against him”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:11), which means he is not liable <b>unless</b> he <b>intended</b> to kill <b>him</b> specifically, so <b>too,</b> in a case of <b>humiliation,</b> the one who humiliated is not liable <b>unless</b> he <b>intended</b> to humiliate <b>him</b> specifically, <b>as it is written: “And she put forth her hand, and took him by his genitals”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:11); this teaches that one is not liable for humiliation <b>unless</b> he <b>intended</b> to humiliate <b>him</b> specifically.
The Gemara returns to analyzing the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and when Rabbi Yehuda said: Slaves have no humiliation,</b> he meant that one would not be liable <b>to give them</b> compensation for humiliation; <b>but</b> if the court needs <b>to appraise</b> compensation for the humiliation of others <b>according to their</b> humiliation, and thereby determine the compensation one owes to a freeman when he intended to humiliate a slave, then <b>we do appraise according to their</b> humiliation.
The Gemara presents an alternative explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. Do you maintain</b> that when the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a <i>gadol</i>,</b> it means he is <b>great in</b> terms of his <b>property,</b> and when the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a <i>katan</i>,</b> it means he is <b>small in</b> terms of his <b>property? No,</b> rather, when the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a <i>gadol</i>,</b> it means <b>an actual adult [<i>gadol</i>]; and</b> when the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a <i>katan</i>,</b> it means <b>an actual minor [<i>katan</i>].</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But is a minor subject to humiliation?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, as Rav Pappa said</b> with regard to another <i>halakha</i>: The case involves a minor <b>who</b> has reached a stage in which when <b>others humiliate him he feels humiliation; here, too,</b>

Daf 86b

say that the <i>baraita</i> discusses a case involving a minor <b>who</b> has reached a stage in which when <b>others humiliate him he feels humiliation.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who humiliates a naked person,</b> or <b>one who humiliates a blind person, or one who humiliates a sleeping person</b> is <b>liable, but a sleeping person who humiliates</b> another is <b>exempt.</b> If one <b>fell from the roof</b> onto another person, <b>and</b> thereby <b>caused</b> him <b>damage and humiliated</b> him, then the one who fell is <b>liable for the</b> indemnity of <b>damage,</b> since a person is always considered forewarned, <b>and exempt from the</b> indemnity of <b>humiliation,</b> since a person is not liable for humiliation <b>unless he intends</b> to humiliate the other person.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:12): If one <b>humiliated</b> another who was <b>naked,</b> he is <b>liable, but</b> the magnitude of humiliation felt when he <b>humiliated him</b> while <b>naked is not comparable to</b> the magnitude of humiliation felt had he <b>humiliated him</b> while <b>clothed,</b> since one who chooses to be naked is less sensitive to humiliation. Similarly, if one <b>humiliated</b> another <b>in a bathhouse,</b> he is <b>liable, but</b> the magnitude of humiliation felt when he <b>humiliated him in a bathhouse is not comparable to</b> the magnitude of humiliation felt had he <b>humiliated him in the marketplace.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master says:</b> If one <b>humiliated</b> another who was <b>naked,</b> the one who humiliated him is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is a naked person subject to humiliation?</b> Is it possible to humiliate him in this state? <b>Rav Pappa said: What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it says: <b>Naked?</b> It means a case <b>where a gust</b> of wind <b>came and lifted his clothes, and</b> then this one <b>came and raised them higher and humiliated him.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> also teaches: If one <b>humiliated</b> another <b>in a bathhouse,</b> he is <b>liable.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is</b> one in <b>a bathhouse subject to humiliation?</b> In a place where people stand naked, can a person be humiliated by having his clothes removed? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is a case <b>where he humiliated him</b> not in an actual bathhouse, but <b>on the bank of the river,</b> which is a place where people behave more discreetly when they undress.
§ <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>humiliated</b> another who was <b>asleep, and</b> he <b>died</b> before he awoke, so he never knew of his humiliation, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara asks: <b>What is his dilemma? Rav Zevid said</b> that <b>this is his dilemma:</b> Is the compensation for humiliation <b>due to embarrassment,</b> i.e., that his feelings suffer because of what he experienced, <b>and this</b> one <b>died and does not have</b> that feeling of <b>embarrassment? Or perhaps</b> the compensation for humiliation <b>is due to disgrace,</b> i.e., lessening of his honor in front of other people, <b>and</b> he <b>disgraced him.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir says: A deaf-mute and a minor have</b> the right to receive compensation for <b>humiliation; an imbecile does not have</b> the right to receive compensation for <b>humiliation.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the compensation is <b>due to disgrace, this</b> explanation <b>is</b> consistent with <b>that which</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> concerning <b>a minor,</b> who can be disgraced; <b>but if you say</b> that the compensation is <b>due to embarrassment, is a minor subject to humiliation?</b>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Rather, what</b> do you mean by stating that the compensation is <b>due to disgrace?</b> If compensation is granted due to disgrace, then <b>an imbecile</b> should receive compensation <b>as well.</b> The Sages <b>say</b> in response: With regard to <b>an imbecile, you</b> can <b>have no greater humiliation than this.</b> It is impossible to degrade him further.
The Gemara returns to the original suggestion: <b>In any case, resolve from this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>that</b> the compensation <b>is due to disgrace, as, if</b> it is <b>due to embarrassment, is a minor subject to embarrassment?</b> The Gemara rejects this proof: This is <b>as Rav Pappa said</b> with regard to a different <i>halakha</i>, cited later by the Gemara: The case involves a minor <b>who</b> has reached an age in which when <b>others humiliate him he feels humiliation; here, too,</b> say that this <i>baraita</i> discusses a case involving a minor <b>who</b> has reached an age in which when <b>others humiliate him he feels humiliation.</b> This is how Rav Zevid understands the dilemma of Rabbi Abba bar Memel.
Rav Pappa explains Rabbi Abba bar Memel’s dilemma differently: <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>this is his dilemma:</b> Is the compensation for humiliation <b>due to his own embarrassment, and</b> this one <b>died</b> and was not embarrassed? <b>Or perhaps</b> the compensation for humiliation is <b>due to</b> his <b>family’s humiliation,</b> and therefore the one who humiliated him must pay compensation to his family?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from the same <i>baraita</i>: <b>A deaf-mute and a minor have</b> the right to receive compensation for <b>humiliation; an imbecile does not have</b> the right to receive compensation for <b>humiliation.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the compensation is <b>due to</b> his <b>family’s humiliation, this</b> explanation <b>is</b> consistent with <b>that which</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> concerning <b>a minor,</b> whose family can experience humiliation based on what was done to their relative; <b>but if you say</b> that the compensation is <b>due to his own embarrassment, is a minor subject to humiliation?</b>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Rather, what</b> do you mean by stating that the compensation is <b>due to the humiliation of members of</b> his <b>family?</b> If this is the case, <b>an imbecile</b> should receive compensation <b>as well.</b> The Sages say in response: If one is <b>an imbecile, you</b> can <b>have no greater humiliation than this.</b>
The Gemara returns to the original suggestion: <b>In any case, resolve from this that</b> the compensation is <b>due to</b> his <b>family’s humiliation, as, if</b> it is <b>due to embarrassment, is a minor subject to embarrassment? Rav Pappa said: Yes,</b> he is subject to embarrassment, as the <i>baraita</i> discusses a case involving a minor <b>who</b> has reached an age in which when <b>others humiliate him he feels humiliation.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>And</b> this distinction <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, as <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: A deaf-mute has</b> the right to receive compensation for <b>humiliation; an imbecile does not have</b> the right to receive compensation for <b>humiliation.</b> With regard to <b>a minor, sometimes he has</b> the right to receive compensation for humiliation, and <b>sometimes he does not have</b> the right. Why is this so? <b>This</b> case where he has the right to receive compensation for humiliation is one involving a minor <b>who</b> has reached the stage in which <b>when others humiliate him he feels humiliation; that</b> case where he does not have the right to receive compensation for humiliation is one involving a minor <b>who</b> has <b>not</b> reached the stage in which <b>when others humiliate him he feels humiliation.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One who humiliates a blind person</b> is liable to pay compensation. The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A blind person</b> who humiliated another <b>does not have</b> liability for <b>humiliation. And</b> in <b>this way Rabbi Yehuda deemed</b> a blind person <b>exempt from</b> being among <b>those liable to be exiled</b> for killing unintentionally, <b>and from</b> being among <b>those liable</b> to receive <b>lashes, and from</b> being among <b>those liable</b> to receive <b>court</b>-imposed <b>capital punishment,</b> if he transgresses a prohibition for which the Torah mandates one of these punishments.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> He <b>derives</b> a verbal analogy to: <b>“Your eye</b> shall not pity” (Deuteronomy 25:12), stated with regard to humiliation, <b>from: “Your eye</b> shall not pity” (Deuteronomy 19:21), stated with regard to <b>conspiring witnesses.</b> The analogy teaches that <b>just as there,</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of conspiring witnesses, <b>blind people</b> are <b>not</b> included, as blind people cannot see events occur in order to testify, <b>so too here,</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of compensation for humiliation, <b>blind people</b> are <b>not</b> included.
The Gemara continues its explanation: Why did Rabbi Yehuda deem a blind person exempt <b>from</b> being among <b>those liable to be exiled</b> for killing unintentionally? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states with regard to an unintentional killing: “Or with any stone, whereby one may die, <b>seeing him not”</b> (Numbers 35:23),this formulation serves to <b>exclude a blind person;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Meir says:</b> The verse serves <b>to include a blind person.</b>
The Gemara explains the dispute: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> He would <b>say to you:</b> The verse states with regard to an unintentional killing, without any further limiting clause: <b>“As when one goes into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:5), <b>and</b> this includes <b>even a blind person;</b> therefore, <b>the Merciful One wrote</b> in the Torah: <b>“Seeing him not”</b> (Numbers 35:23), <b>to exclude</b> a blind person.
<b>And</b> what is the reasoning of <b>Rabbi Meir? The Merciful One wrote</b> in the Torah: <b>“Seeing him not”</b> (Numbers 35:23), apparently <b>to exclude</b> one who happened to not see the one he killed; <b>and the Merciful One wrote</b> in the Torah: “Who kills his neighbor <b>unawares”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:4), apparently <b>to exclude</b> a blind person, who is not aware of where others are standing. <b>This is a restriction following a restriction, and</b> there is a hermeneutical principle that <b>a restriction following a restriction</b> serves <b>only to amplify</b> the <i>halakha</i> and include additional cases. Therefore, a blind person is included in the <i>halakha</i> of those liable to be exiled for unintentional killing.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what would <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> respond to this reasoning? The Gemara explains: <b>That</b> verse: “Who kills his neighbor <b>unawares,”</b> does not exclude one who could not see, but rather, <b>it comes to exclude</b> one who was <b>intending</b> to kill a particular person and unintentionally killed someone else. That killer is not exiled.
The Gemara continues to explain the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. Why did he deem a blind person exempt from being among <b>those liable</b> to receive <b>court</b>-imposed <b>capital punishment?</b> That <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy to: “But if he smote him with an instrument of iron so that he died, he is <b>a killer;</b> the killer shall be put to death” (Numbers 35:16), written with regard to capital punishment, <b>from:</b> “You shall appoint for yourselves cities, to be cities of refuge for you, that <b>a killer</b> who killed any person unintentionally may flee there” (Numbers 35:11), written with regard to <b>those liable to be exiled.</b>
Why did Rabbi Yehuda deem a blind person exempt from being among <b>those liable</b> to receive <b>lashes?</b> That <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> by means of a verbal analogy to: “Then it shall be, if the <b>guilty</b> one deserves to be beaten” (Deuteronomy 25:2), written with regard to lashes, <b>from:</b> “Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer, that is <b>guilty</b> of death” (Numbers 35:31), written with regard to <b>those liable</b> to receive <b>court</b>-imposed <b>capital punishment.</b>
The Gemara presents another statement of Rabbi Yehuda: It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A blind person does not have humiliation,</b>

Daf 87a

<b>and so did Rabbi Yehuda exempt</b> a blind person <b>from all judgments</b> of civil law <b>that are in the Torah.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states</b> with regard to an unintentional killing: <b>“Then the congregation shall judge between the smiter and the avenger of blood, according to these laws”</b> (Numbers 35:24), to teach that <b>anyone who is subject to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a smiter and to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an avenger of blood is subject to</b> civil <b>laws, and anyone who is not subject to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a smiter or to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>an avenger of blood,</b> including a blind person, <b>is not subject to</b> civil <b>laws.</b>
The Gemara presents another statement of Rabbi Yehuda. It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A blind person does not have,</b> i.e., receive, compensation for <b>humiliation, and so did Rabbi Yehuda exempt</b> a blind person <b>from all mitzvot that are stated in the Torah. Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states: “And this is the commandment, statutes, and laws”</b> (Deuteronomy 6:1), to teach that <b>anyone who is subject to</b> civil <b>laws is</b> also <b>subject to</b> the <b>commandments and statutes, and anyone who is not subject to</b> civil <b>laws,</b> including a blind person, <b>is</b> also <b>not subject to</b> the <b>commandments and statutes.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef,</b> who was blind, <b>said: At first, I would say:</b> If I hear <b>one who says that</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says: A blind person</b> is <b>exempt from the mitzvot,</b> then <b>I will host a festive day for the Sages. What is the reason?</b> It is <b>that I am not commanded and</b> nevertheless <b>I perform mitzvot.</b>
Rav Yosef continues. <b>But now that I heard this</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> One who is <b>commanded and performs</b> a mitzva <b>is greater than</b> one who <b>is not commanded and performs</b> it, I say: If I hear <b>one who says to me</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> then <b>I will host a festive day for the Sages. What is the reason?</b> It is <b>that as I am commanded, I have more reward.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is a stringency with regard to a person</b> who caused injury, <b>compared to</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an ox</b> that caused injury: The <i>halakha</i> is <b>that the person pays</b> compensation for <b>damage, pain, medical costs, loss of livelihood, and humiliation; and</b> if he caused a woman to miscarry he also <b>pays compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring,</b> as the verse states (see Exodus 21:22). <b>But</b> in the case of <b>an ox</b> that caused injury, the owner <b>pays only</b> compensation for <b>damage, and</b> he is <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>compensation for</b> miscarried <b>offspring.</b>
The mishna continues: <b>One who strikes his father or his mother but did not cause them</b> to have <b>a bruise,</b> and therefore is not liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment, <b>and one who injures another on Yom Kippur,</b> the punishment for which is not court-imposed capital punishment, is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for all of</b> the five types of indemnity.
<b>One who injures a Hebrew slave</b> is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>for all of</b> the five types of indemnity. This is <b>except for</b> compensation for <b>loss of livelihood</b> suffered <b>during the time that</b> the injured slave <b>belongs to</b> the one that injured him. Since the right to the slave’s labor belongs to his master, his inability to work is his master’s loss. <b>One who injures a Canaanite slave belonging to others is liable</b> to pay <b>for all of</b> the five types of indemnity. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Canaanite <b>slaves do not have humiliation,</b> so the one who injures the slave pays only the other four types of indemnity.
The mishna continues: With regard to <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, an encounter with them is disadvantageous.</b> In other words, no favorable outcome is possible for someone involved in an incident with one of these people, since <b>one who injures them</b> is <b>liable. But</b> if <b>they were</b> the ones <b>who injured others, they</b> are <b>exempt.</b> This is because they lack awareness and are not responsible for their actions.
Similarly, with regard to <b>a slave and</b> a married <b>woman, an encounter with them is disadvantageous,</b> since <b>one who injures them</b> is <b>liable. But</b> if <b>they</b> were the ones <b>who injured others, they</b> are <b>exempt,</b> because they do not have money with which to pay compensation. <b>But they pay</b> compensation <b>at a later time.</b> The exemption is only temporary, as, if <b>the woman becomes divorced</b> or <b>the slave becomes emancipated,</b> and they then have their own money, they are <b>liable to pay</b> compensation.
The mishna continues: <b>One who strikes his father or his mother and causes them</b> to have <b>a bruise, or one who injures another on Shabbat,</b> is <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>all of</b> the five types of indemnity, <b>because he is judged with</b> losing <b>his life.</b> The court imposes capital punishment for these acts, so there is no additional monetary punishment.
<b>And one who injures his own Canaanite slave</b> is <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>all of</b> the five types of indemnity, because his slave is his property.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara discusses a case of compensation for injury. <b>Rabbi Elazar raised a dilemma before Rav:</b> In a case of <b>one who injures the minor daughter of others, to whom</b> does he pay compensation for the <b>injury?</b>
Rabbi Elazar explains the dilemma: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since the Merciful One granted the profits of</b> her <b>youth to the father,</b> as he receives her betrothal money, compensation for <b>injury also belongs to her father? What is the reason</b> that he should receive it? The reason is <b>that</b> the one who injured her <b>lowered her monetary</b> value, resulting in her father receiving gifts of lesser value when she is betrothed. <b>Or perhaps it is</b> only <b>the profits of</b> her <b>youth that the Merciful One granted to</b> her father, <b>because if he desires to give her</b> in marriage <b>to a</b> man <b>afflicted with boils, he can give</b> her to him, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>injury, since if he desires to injure her he may not injure her,</b> just as he may not injure any other person, <b>the Merciful One did not grant him</b> the right to receive the compensation when she is injured.

Daf 87b

Rav <b>said to</b> Rabbi Elazar in response: <b>The Torah granted the father only the profits of</b> her <b>youth</b> and nothing else. Therefore, compensation for the injury goes to the daughter. Rabbi Elazar <b>raised an objection to</b> Rav’s statement based on the mishna: <b>One who injures a Hebrew slave</b> is <b>liable for all of</b> the five types of indemnity. This is <b>except for</b> compensation for <b>loss of livelihood</b> occurring <b>during the time that</b> the injured slave <b>belongs to</b> the one that injured him. This should be the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a minor daughter as well, that since the father has the right to the earnings of his minor daughter, he should receive the compensation for her loss of livelihood. <b>Abaye said</b> in response: <b>Rav concedes with regard to</b> compensation for her <b>loss of livelihood</b> that it is paid to the father, <b>since her earnings belong to her father until the time of</b> her <b>adulthood,</b> and therefore her inability to work is her father’s loss.
Rabbi Elazar <b>raised an objection to</b> Rav’s statement based on a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who injures his adult son</b> must <b>give him</b> his compensation <b>immediately.</b> If one injured <b>his minor son he</b> must <b>make a safe investment [<i>segulla</i>] for him</b> with the compensation money. <b>One who injures his minor daughter</b> is <b>exempt, and moreover,</b> if there were <b>others who injured her,</b> they are <b>liable to give</b> compensation <b>to her father.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>So too</b> here, the <i>baraita</i> is speaking <b>with regard to</b> the daughter’s <b>loss of livelihood</b> alone, which is paid to the father. The other types of indemnity are paid to the daughter.
The Gemara questions the first ruling of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> is it so that if a father injured <b>his adult son he</b> must <b>give him</b> his compensation <b>immediately? And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from that which is taught in another <i>baraita</i>: In a case of <b>one who injures the sons or daughters of others,</b> if they are <b>adults he</b> must <b>give them</b> their compensation <b>immediately;</b> if they are <b>minors he</b> must <b>make a safe investment for them.</b> If one injures <b>his own sons or daughters,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying them compensation.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> states that the father is exempt, it is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the children <b>are dependent on</b> their father’s <b>table</b> for support. <b>There,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> states that the father is liable, it is dealing with a case <b>where</b> the children <b>are not dependent on his table.</b>
The Gemara challenges this resolution of the two <i>baraitot</i>: <b>In what</b> manner <b>did you interpret the first</b> <i>baraita</i>? You interpreted it as dealing with a case <b>where</b> the children <b>are not dependent on his table? If so, say the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who injures his minor daughter</b> is <b>exempt, and moreover,</b> if there were <b>others who injured her,</b> they are <b>liable to give</b> compensation <b>to her father.</b> If this is a case where the daughter is not dependent upon her father for support, then the one who injured her would be <b>required to give</b> the compensation <b>to her, because she needs</b> to provide her own <b>sustenance.</b>
The Gemara continues its challenge. <b>And even according to the one who says</b> that <b>a master can say to</b> his <b>slave: Work for me but I will not feed you,</b> i.e., a master is not legally obligated to provide sustenance for his slave, <b>this matter applies</b> only <b>to a Canaanite slave, as</b> the master can <b>say to him: Work</b> for me <b>the entire day, and at night go around,</b> beg, <b>and eat. But</b> in the case of <b>a Hebrew slave, as it is written</b> with regard to him: <b>“Because he fares well with you”</b> (Deuteronomy 15:16), indicating that the Hebrew slave must be <b>“with you” in food</b> and <b>“with you” in drink,</b> i.e., the Hebrew slave is entitled to live with his master as an equal, the master may <b>not</b> compel the slave to serve him unless he feeds him. <b>All the more so</b> is it not the case with regard to <b>his daughter,</b> that she is not required to beg for her sustenance and should receive the compensation herself?
The Gemara answers: This is <b>as Rava, son of Rav Ulla, said</b> concerning a similar matter (<i>Ketubot</i> 43a): This <i>halakha</i> is <b>necessary only for</b> the <b>surplus,</b> i.e., money that a woman earns beyond what she needs for her essential sustenance. <b>Here too,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is <b>necessary only for</b> the <b>surplus.</b> If the compensation for injury is more than the daughter requires for her sustenance, the additional sum is paid to her father.
The Gemara again challenges the resolution of the two <i>baraitot</i>: <b>In what</b> manner <b>did you interpret the latter</b> <i>baraita</i> discussing one who injures the children of another? You interpreted it as dealing with a case <b>where</b> the sons <b>are dependent on</b> their father’s <b>table.</b> But the <i>baraita</i> also stated: If they are <b>adults, he</b> must <b>give them</b> their compensation <b>immediately;</b> if they are <b>minors, he</b> must <b>make a safe investment for them. Why</b> does he make a safe investment for them? Shouldn’t he be <b>required to give</b> the compensation <b>to their father?</b>
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>Where</b> the father <b>is particular</b> about receiving money that would go to his child is specifically <b>in a matter that causes</b> him <b>a loss,</b> as in a case where the father himself injured his child and would need to pay compensation. But <b>in a matter that comes from elsewhere,</b> as in a case where someone else injured his child, he <b>is not particular</b> about receiving the money, and it is paid to the child.
The Gemara challenges that response: <b>But</b> isn’t <b>a found</b> item a matter <b>that comes to</b> the children <b>from elsewhere, and</b> the father <b>is particular</b> about receiving it? The Sages <b>say</b> in response: With regard to <b>profit that comes to</b> the children <b>from elsewhere, and they do not</b> suffer <b>physical pain in</b> obtaining <b>it,</b> the father <b>is particular</b> about receiving the money, as he does not feel that the children deserve it. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>an injury, where they</b> suffer <b>physical pain and it comes to them from elsewhere,</b> the father <b>is not particular</b> about receiving the compensation paid to his child.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But there,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, isn’t it discussing a case <b>where</b> the daughter suffers <b>physical pain, and</b> it is a matter that <b>comes to her from elsewhere, and</b> the father <b>is particular</b> about receiving the money, <b>as it teaches: And moreover,</b> if there were <b>others who injured her,</b> they are <b>liable to give</b> compensation <b>to her father?</b>
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> discusses a case <b>where</b> the father <b>is a captious man,</b> which is evident from the case of the <i>baraita</i> itself, <b>as</b> his children <b>are not dependent on his table.</b> A man like this <b>is particular even about matters that come to them from elsewhere.</b> By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the latter <i>baraita</i>, it discusses a case <b>where</b> the father <b>is not a captious man,</b> which is evident from the case of the <i>baraita</i> itself, <b>as</b> his children <b>are dependent on his table. When he is particular</b> about receiving the money, it is <b>in a matter that causes him a loss,</b> but <b>in a matter that comes to them from elsewhere,</b> he <b>is not particular.</b>
The two <i>baraitot</i> stated that the father makes a safe investment for his minor children with the compensation paid to them. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>a safe investment? Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The father should purchase <b>a Torah scroll</b> for his child. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna, says:</b> The father should purchase <b>a date palm, from which</b> the child <b>will consume dates.</b>
The Gemara comments that the <i>amora’im</i> of Eretz Yisrael discussed the same issue as did those in Babylonia. <b>And so says Reish Lakish: The Torah granted the father only the profits of</b> her <b>youth,</b> and nothing else. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The father receives <b>even</b> the compensation for his daughter’s <b>wound.</b>
The Gemara objects: Does it <b>enter your mind</b> that the father receives compensation for his daughter’s <b>wound,</b> which, unlike an injury, does not diminish his daughter’s value? <b>Even Rabbi Elazar raised his dilemma only</b> with regard to <b>an injury,</b>

Daf 88a

by <b>which he lowered her monetary</b> value, diminishing the amount of money that her father will receive for her betrothal. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a wound,</b> by <b>which he did not lower her monetary</b> value, <b>Rabbi Elazar did not</b> even <b>raise a dilemma.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said:</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan is discussing a case <b>where</b> someone <b>wounded her on her face, and he</b> thereby <b>lowered her monetary</b> value, as this affects the amount of money that her father will receive for her betrothal.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One who injures a Canaanite slave belonging to others</b> is <b>liable</b> for all of the five types of indemnity. Rabbi Yehuda says: Canaanite slaves do not have humiliation, so one who injures a slave pays only the other four types of indemnity. <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda?</b> The Gemara explains: The <b>verse states</b> with regard to the indemnity of humiliation: <b>“When men strive together, a man and his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:11). The formulation “and his brother” teaches that the payment of compensation for humiliation is applicable <b>with regard to someone who has</b> a relationship of <b>brotherhood</b> with a Jew. This is <b>excluding</b> a Canaanite <b>slave, who does not have</b> a relationship of <b>brotherhood</b> with Jews. <b>And the Sages,</b> who hold that a Canaanite slave is included in the <i>halakhot</i> of compensation for humiliation, maintain that <b>he is</b> the Jews’ <b>brother with regard to</b> the observance of <b>mitzvot,</b> as a Canaanite slave is obligated to observe most mitzvot.
The Gemara challenges: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that slaves are not in the category of brothers, <b>conspiring witnesses</b> who testify that a Canaanite <b>slave</b> committed a sin punishable by capital punishment <b>should not be put to death</b> by the court, <b>as it is written: “You shall do unto him as he conspired to do unto his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:19), and the slave is not considered a brother. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet said: The</b> same <b>verse states</b> with regard to conspiring witnesses: <b>“And you shall put away the evil from your midst,”</b> indicating that the punishment for conspiring witnesses should be applied <b>in any case,</b> including when they testified about a slave.
The Gemara raises another challenge: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>according to the Sages,</b> who hold that slaves are in the category of brothers, a Canaanite <b>slave should be fit for kingship,</b> as it is written: “One from among your brothers shall you set a king over you” (Deuteronomy 17:15). The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>But according to your reasoning,</b> the <i>halakha</i> disqualifying <b>a convert</b> from being king <b>should pose a difficulty for you according to all</b> opinions, both according to the opinion of the Sages and of Rabbi Yehuda: Why is a convert not fit to be a king, as he is certainly in the category of brother? The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, the verse states: “One from among your brothers</b> shall you set a king over you,” which indicates that the king must be <b>from the choicest among your brothers,</b> which disqualifies both converts and slaves.
The Gemara challenges further: <b>If that is so,</b> then <b>according to the Sages,</b> who hold that slaves are in the category of brothers, a Canaanite <b>slave should be fit to bear witness, as it is written: “And behold, the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:18). If a slave is considered a brother, why is he not eligible to testify in court?
<b>Ulla said: You cannot say</b> that a slave is fit to bear <b>witness,</b> because the <i>halakha</i> concerning the <b>testimony</b> of a slave <b>is derived by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning the testimony of <b>a woman: And just as a woman, who is fit to enter into the congregation,</b> i.e., to marry a Jew of fit lineage, <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>disqualified from bearing witness,</b> so too, with regard to <b>a slave, who is not fit to enter the congregation, is it not logical that</b> he is <b>disqualified from bearing witness?</b>
The Gemara counters this derivation: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a woman?</b> She is notable <b>in that she is not fit to</b> undergo the mitzva of <b>circumcision.</b> Would <b>you say</b> that from the fact that a woman is disqualified from bearing witness one can derive that the same is true <b>for a slave, who is fit to</b> undergo <b>circumcision?</b> The Gemara responds: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>a minor shall prove</b> that one’s fitness to undergo circumcision is not germane to one’s qualification to bear witness, <b>as</b> a minor <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the mitzva to undergo <b>circumcision, and</b> yet he <b>is disqualified from bearing witness.</b>
This is countered: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a minor?</b> He is notable <b>in that he is not</b> obligated <b>in</b> the performance of <b>mitzvot.</b> Would <b>you say</b> that from the fact that a minor is disqualified from bearing witness one can derive that the same is true <b>for a slave, who is</b> obligated <b>in</b> the performance of <b>mitzvot?</b> The Gemara responds: The <i>halakha</i> of <b>a woman shall prove</b> the matter, <b>as she is</b> obligated <b>in</b> the performance of <b>mitzvot and is disqualified from bearing witness.</b>
<b>And the derivation has reverted</b> to its starting point. <b>The aspect of this</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of that</b> case, <b>and the aspect of that</b> case <b>is not like the aspect of this</b> case, as each case has its own unique <i>halakha</i>. <b>Their common denominator</b> is <b>that</b> both a woman and a minor <b>are not</b> obligated <b>in</b> the performance of <b>all the mitzvot and are disqualified from bearing witness. I will also bring</b> the case of <b>the slave</b> for inclusion in this <i>halakha</i>, <b>as he is</b> also <b>not</b> obligated <b>in</b> the performance of <b>all the mitzvot and is disqualified from bearing witness.</b>
This derivation is rejected: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about their common denominator?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> a woman or a minor <b>is not a man,</b> and this is why they are disqualified from bearing witness. Would <b>you say</b> that from the fact that they are disqualified from bearing witness one can derive that the same is true <b>for a slave, who is a man?</b>
The Gemara offers a different derivation: <b>Rather, derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a slave is disqualified from bearing witness <b>from</b> that of <b>a robber,</b> who is disqualified from bearing witness. The Gemara objects: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about a robber?</b> He is notable <b>in that his actions caused him</b> to be disqualified. Would <b>you say</b> that from the fact that a robber is disqualified from bearing witness one can derive that the same is true <b>for a slave, whose actions did not cause him</b> to be unfit?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from a robber and from one of these</b> other two, either a woman or a minor. Their common denominator is that they do not observe all the mitzvot and are disqualified from bearing witness. So too, a slave does not observe all the mitzvot and is disqualified from bearing witness.
<b>Mar, son of Ravina, said</b> another derivation. <b>The verse states: “Fathers shall not be put to death for children”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:16), meaning that people <b>shall not be put to death based on</b> the testimony of <b>fathers who do not have</b> common <b>lineage [<i>ḥayis</i>] with</b> their <b>children.</b> This is referring to Canaanite slaves, whose children are not considered to be related to them. <b>For if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> to interpret the verse according to its straightforward meaning, <b>as we say: “Fathers shall not be put to death for children,”</b> meaning <b>by the testimony of</b> their <b>children,</b> then <b>let the Merciful One write: Fathers shall not be put to death for their children. What</b> does the verse teach by stating only: <b>“Children,”</b> without the word their? <b>Learn from</b> this formulation <b>that</b> people <b>shall not be put to death based on</b> the testimony of <b>fathers who do not have</b> common <b>lineage with</b> their <b>children.</b>
The Gemara challenges this: <b>If that is so,</b> when the end of the verse states: <b>“Nor shall children be put to death for fathers”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:16), does this <b>also</b> mean that people <b>shall not be put to death based on</b> the testimony of <b>children who do not have</b> common <b>lineage with</b> their <b>fathers? But</b> if that were the case, it would <b>also</b> be the case that <b>a convert</b> would be <b>disqualified from bearing witness,</b> as one who converts no longer shares common lineage with his parents.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared?</b> With regard to <b>a convert, although he has no</b> common <b>lineage</b> with those <b>above</b> him, i.e., his parents, <b>he</b> does <b>have</b> common <b>lineage</b> with those <b>below</b> him, i.e., his children. This serves <b>to exclude a slave, who has no</b> common <b>lineage either</b> with those <b>above</b> him <b>or</b> with those <b>below</b> him.
The Sages prove that a convert is fit to bear witness: <b>As, if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> that <b>a convert is disqualified from bearing witness,</b> then <b>let the Merciful One write: Fathers shall not be put to death for their children, according to</b> the interpretation <b>that we say:</b> Fathers <b>shall not be put to death based on the testimony of</b> their <b>children; and let the Merciful One</b> also <b>write: “Nor shall children be put to death for fathers,” from which you learn two</b> <i>halakhot</i>: <b>One,</b> that <b>children shall not be put to death by</b> the <b>testimony of</b> their <b>fathers, and another,</b> that people <b>shall not be put to death based on</b> the testimony of <b>children who do not have</b> common <b>lineage with</b> their <b>fathers,</b> i.e., converts.
The Gemara continues the statement: <b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a slave</b> being disqualified from bearing witness <b>is derived by an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a convert: And just as</b> with regard to <b>a convert, that it is</b> the case concerning those <b>above</b> him <b>that he has no</b> common <b>lineage, but</b> with those <b>below</b> him <b>he</b> does <b>have</b> common <b>lineage,</b> and he is <b>disqualified from bearing witness,</b> then with regard to <b>a slave, who has no</b> common <b>lineage</b> with those <b>above</b> him <b>or</b> those <b>below</b> him, all the more so <b>is it not logical that he is disqualified from bearing witness?</b>
The Gemara continues the statement: <b>Rather, due to</b> the fact <b>that the Merciful One</b> did not write the verse that way, but instead <b>wrote: “Fathers shall not be put to death for children,” which indicates</b> that people <b>shall not be put to death based on</b> the testimony of <b>fathers who do not have</b> common <b>lineage with</b> their <b>children, learn from</b> this formulation that with regard to <b>a slave, who has no</b> common <b>lineage</b> with those <b>above</b> him <b>or</b> those <b>below</b> him, <b>he</b> is the one <b>who is disqualified from bearing witness. But</b> with regard to <b>a convert, since he has</b> common <b>lineage</b> with those <b>below</b> him, he is <b>fit to bear witness.</b>
<b>And if you would say: Let the Merciful One write: Nor shall children be put to death for their fathers, why do I</b> need <b>that</b> which <b>the Merciful One wrote: “Nor shall children be put to death for fathers,” which indicates</b> that people <b>shall not be put to death based on</b> the testimony of <b>children who do not have</b> common <b>lineage</b> with their <b>fathers?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the Merciful One <b>wrote: “Fathers shall not be put to death for children,”</b> He <b>also wrote</b> in the same manner: <b>“Nor shall children be put to death for fathers.”</b>
§ The mishna (87a) teaches: With regard to <b>a deaf-mute, an imbecile, or a minor, an encounter with them is disadvantageous,</b> since one who injures them is liable. But if they were the ones who injured, they are exempt. The Gemara relates an incident: <b>The mother of Rav Shmuel bar Abba from</b> the city of <b>Hagroneya was married to Rabbi Abba. She wrote,</b> i.e., signed over, her <b>property to Rav Shmuel bar Abba, her son. After she died,</b>

Daf 88b

<b>Rav Shmuel bar Abba went before Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba</b> to claim his mother’s property. Rabbi Yirmeya <b>established him</b> as the owner <b>of the property,</b> in accordance with what was written in the document. <b>Rabbi Abba,</b> the mother’s husband, <b>went</b> and <b>said</b> a report of <b>the matter before Rav Hoshaya. Rav Hoshaya went</b> and <b>said</b> a report of the matter <b>before Rav Yehuda.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Rav Hoshaya: <b>This</b> is what <b>Shmuel says:</b> In a case of <b>a woman who sold her usufruct property,</b> which belongs to her but whose profits her husband garners, <b>in her husband’s lifetime, and</b> then she <b>died, the husband repossesses</b> the property <b>from the purchasers.</b> The granting of her property by means of the document is analogous to a sale, and Rabbi Abba can repossess the property from Rav Shmuel bar Abba.
The Sages <b>said that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>before Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba,</b> who had ruled that the property belongs to Rav Shmuel bar Abba. <b>He said to them: I know the mishna</b> that supports my opinion, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Batra</i> 136a): In the case of <b>one who writes</b> a document transferring ownership of <b>his property to his son,</b> stating that the transfer should take effect immediately but the son will have use of it only <b>after</b> the father’s <b>death, the son cannot sell</b> the property <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is</b> still <b>in the father’s possession. And the father,</b> even though he retained the right to use the property, <b>cannot sell</b> the property <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it is written</b> as belonging <b>to the son.</b> If <b>the father sold</b> the property, then <b>it is sold</b> to the extent that the purchaser may use it <b>until</b> the father <b>dies.</b> If <b>the son sold</b> the property during his father’s lifetime, <b>the purchaser does not have</b> the right to use the property <b>until the father dies.</b>
Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba infers: <b>In any event,</b> if the son sold the property during his father’s lifetime, <b>when the father dies the purchaser has</b> rights to the property. <b>And</b> this would be so <b>even though</b> it is a case <b>where the son died in the father’s lifetime, where</b> the property <b>never came into the son’s possession.</b>
Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba’s analysis is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, who says:</b> There is <b>no difference</b> if <b>the son died in the father’s lifetime, where</b> the property <b>never came into the son’s possession,</b> and there is <b>no difference</b> if <b>the father died in the son’s lifetime, where the</b> property <b>came into the son’s possession.</b> In any event, <b>the purchaser acquired</b> the property.
The Gemara records a dispute between the <i>amora’im</i> with regard to this point. <b>As was stated:</b> In a case where <b>the son sold</b> the property <b>in the father’s lifetime, and the son died in the father’s lifetime, Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The purchaser did not acquire</b> the property. <b>Reish Lakish says: The purchaser acquired</b> the property.
The Gemara explains the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The purchaser did not acquire</b> the property, because he could have <b>said to you: When the mishna teaches</b> that if <b>the son sold</b> the property during his father’s lifetime <b>the purchaser does not acquire</b> any rights to use the property <b>until the father dies, and</b> one could infer that <b>when the father dies the purchaser has</b> rights to the property, the mishna is discussing a case <b>where the son did not die during the father’s lifetime,</b> so <b>that</b> the property <b>came into the son’s possession</b> upon the father’s death, before the purchaser acquired it. <b>But</b> if <b>the son died in the father’s lifetime,</b> so <b>that</b> the property <b>did not come into the son’s possession,</b> then <b>even when the father dies the purchaser does not have</b> rights to the property.
The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds</b> that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and to <b>its produce is considered to be like ownership of the item itself.</b> Even though the property itself did not belong to the father, it is as though the father owned the property, because all of the produce belonged to him in practice. Therefore, <b>when</b> the son <b>sold</b> the property, <b>he sold</b> property <b>that did not belong to him.</b>
The Gemara explains the opinion of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says</b> that the <b>purchaser acquired</b> the property based on this claim: <b>When the mishna teaches</b> that if <b>the son sold</b> the property during his father’s lifetime <b>the purchaser does not have</b> any right to use the property <b>until the father dies,</b> and one could infer that <b>in any event, when the father dies the purchaser has</b> rights to the property, the mishna means that there is <b>no difference</b> if <b>the son did not die in the father’s lifetime, where the</b> property <b>came into the son’s possession, and</b> there is <b>no difference</b> if <b>the son died in the father’s lifetime, where the</b> property <b>did not come into the son’s possession.</b> In either case, the <b>purchaser acquired</b> the property.
The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>holds</b> that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and to <b>its produce is not considered to be like ownership of the item itself. And</b> therefore <b>when</b> the son <b>sold</b> the property, <b>he sold</b> property <b>that belonged to him.</b>
The Gemara returns to the discussion of the opinion of Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba. <b>And now</b> for <b>us, whether</b> if one discusses the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba and whether</b> one discusses the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda, they</b> both <b>hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish,</b> that ownership of the rights to use an item and to its produce is not considered to be like ownership of the item itself. <b>And Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says: If</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and to <b>its produce is considered to be like ownership of the item itself,</b> then <b>when the father dies and the son</b> had <b>died in the father’s lifetime, why does the purchaser have</b> rights to the property? <b>When</b> the son <b>sold</b> it, <b>didn’t he sell</b> property <b>that did not belong to him?</b>
<b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and to <b>its produce is not considered to be like ownership of the item itself?</b> Therefore, Rav Shmuel bar Abba should receive the property transferred to him by his mother, as the fact that the husband owned the rights to its produce does not limit her ability to transfer her property to her son.
The Sages <b>brought back</b> Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba’s reply <b>before Rav Yehuda.</b> Rav Yehuda <b>said to them: This is</b> what <b>Shmuel said: This</b> <i>halakha</i>, that a husband can repossess the property that his wife sold before she died, <b>is not similar to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>our mishna</b> concerning a father who transfers his property to his son while retaining the right to garner the profits.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning</b> for distinguishing between the two cases? <b>Rav Yosef said: Granted, if</b> the mishna had <b>taught the opposite</b> and stated that in the case of <b>one who writes</b> a document transferring ownership of <b>his property to his father</b> after his death, with the son retaining the right to garner the profits until then, and the father sold the property during his son’s lifetime, the purchaser has rights to the property after the son dies, then <b>it is</b> possible <b>to resolve from</b> the mishna <b>that ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and to <b>its produce is not considered to be like ownership of the item itself.</b>
Rav Yosef continues: <b>But now that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> specifically: <b>One who writes</b> a document transferring ownership of <b>his property to his son,</b> the ability of the son to sell the property is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the son <b>is fit to inherit</b> from <b>him</b> and already has a right to the property, and not just due to the existence of the document. In the case of Rav Shmuel bar Abba as well, the woman’s property is inherited by her husband, not her son, so she cannot transfer it to Rav Shmuel bar Abba.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Is this to say that a son inherits</b> from <b>a father,</b> but <b>a father does not inherit</b> from <b>a son?</b> There is no difference between their rights to inherit from one another. <b>Rather,</b> even if the mishna taught a <i>halakha</i> concerning a son transferring his property to his father, the son’s reason for doing so could have been that <b>he comes to hide his property from his</b> own <b>son</b> and wants his father to inherit from him instead. <b>Here too,</b> when a father transfers his property to his son, <b>he comes to hide his property from</b> the son’s <b>brothers,</b> as the father has other sons but does not want them to inherit from him. Therefore, the mishna’s choice of case cannot serve as a basis for inference.
Abaye continues: <b>Rather, what</b> was Shmuel’s reason for saying that the right of a husband to the property that his wife sold before she died <b>is not similar to our mishna</b> that states that a father does not have rights to property sold by his son? The difference is <b>due to</b> the rabbinic <b>ordinance of Usha,</b> an ordinance instituted with regard to a husband’s rights to his wife’s property. <b>As Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: In</b> the town of <b>Usha</b> the Sages <b>instituted</b> that in the case of <b>a woman who sold her usufruct property in her husband’s lifetime and</b> then <b>died, the husband repossesses</b> it <b>from the purchasers.</b> This ordinance was instituted only for the benefit of a husband, but not for the benefit of a father or son.
<b>Rav Idi bar Avin said: We too learn</b> of the ordinance of Usha in the <i>baraita</i>: If witnesses said: <b>We testify about so-and-so that he divorced his wife and gave</b> her the full value of the obligations recorded in <b>her marriage contract,</b>

Daf 89a

<b>and she is under him and serves him,</b> i.e., she was in fact still married to him, <b>and</b> then these witnesses <b>were found to be conspiring</b> witnesses who were attempting to deny this woman the ability to ever collect payment of her marriage contract, then the court <b>does not say</b> that the witnesses <b>shall pay the entire</b> value of <b>her marriage contract. Rather,</b> the court says that they shall pay the <b>financial advantage of her marriage contract.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the financial advantage of her marriage contract?</b> The court <b>evaluates how much a person</b> would <b>want to give</b> to purchase the rights <b>of this</b> woman’s <b>marriage contract,</b> taking into account the <i>halakha</i> <b>that if she becomes widowed or divorced</b> the purchaser will receive its full value, <b>but if she dies</b> during her husband’s lifetime, <b>her husband will inherit her</b> property and the purchaser will receive nothing.
Rav Idi bar Avin continues: <b>And if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> that <b>there is no ordinance of Usha, why would her husband inherit</b> from <b>her?</b> Let the woman <b>sell her marriage contract entirely.</b>
<b>Abaye said:</b> This is not a proof for the existence of the ordinance of Usha, because even <b>if</b> there is no ordinance, and the Sages <b>said</b> that the woman retains the right to sell <b>with regard to</b> the <b>usufruct property,</b> would they also <b>say</b> that the woman retains the right to sell <b>with regard to guaranteed property,</b> which is listed among the possessions she brought into the marriage but is entirely under her husband’s authority? In any event, there is property that she does not have the right to sell and that the husband would inherit if she dies, regardless of whether or not there is an ordinance of Usha, so the marriage contract could not be sold for its full value.
§ <b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to <b>financial advantage, since</b> discussion of this matter <b>came to us, let us say something about it.</b> The money received for selling the <b>financial advantage is</b> given only <b>to the wife. For if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> to say that it <b>is</b> given <b>to the husband,</b> then <b>let</b> the conspiring <b>witnesses,</b> who have been rendered liable to pay a penalty to the wife, <b>say to her: What loss have we caused you</b> by testifying that you had received payment of your marriage contract? Even <b>if you were to sell it for</b> the <b>financial advantage,</b> your <b>husband would have taken</b> it <b>from you. Rav Shalman said</b> in response: She still would incur a loss, <b>because there is a gain</b> to <b>the household.</b> Even if the husband were to be the one to receive the payment from the sale, the financial situation of the household would be improved, leading to a concrete benefit for the wife as well. This offsets the wife’s potential loss.
<b>Rava said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that the money received for selling the <b>financial advantage</b> of the marriage contract is given only <b>to the wife, and the husband does not</b> even <b>garner the profits</b> from that money or from property the wife would purchase with that money. <b>What is the reason? The Sages instituted</b> that <b>the profits</b> of her property are <b>for</b> the husband, but <b>the Sages did not institute</b> that <b>the profits of the profits</b> are <b>for him.</b>
§ <b>When Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, came from the study hall of Rav they said: We learned</b> a source <b>for</b> the <b>ordinance of Usha</b> in the mishna (87a): With regard to <b>a slave or</b> a married <b>woman, an encounter with them is disadvantageous,</b> since <b>one who injures them</b> is <b>liable. But</b> if <b>they</b> were the ones who <b>injured others they</b> are <b>exempt,</b> because they do not have money with which to pay. <b>And if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> to say that <b>there is no ordinance of Usha,</b> there would be a method by which a married woman can obtain money with which to pay, as the court can have <b>her sell</b> her <b>usufruct property and give</b> the money received <b>to</b> the one she injured. It can therefore be inferred from the mishna that a woman cannot sell her usufruct property, in accordance with the ordinance of Usha.
The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning, though indeed there is an ordinance of Usha, and she cannot fully sell</b> her usufruct property, <b>she</b> should nevertheless be able to <b>sell</b> her <b>usufruct property for</b> the <b>financial advantage,</b> i.e., the purchaser will pay her for the future rights to the property in the event that she gets divorced or is widowed, <b>and she will give</b> that money <b>to</b> the one she injured. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that the mishna is discussing a case <b>where she does not have</b> usufruct property of which she can sell the future rights. <b>So too,</b> there is no source from the mishna for the ordinance of Usha, as the mishna is discussing a case <b>where she does not have</b> usufruct property to sell.
The Gemara questions the ruling of the mishna: Why does the mishna assert that a married woman will not have money with which to pay, <b>but she should sell</b> the <b>financial advantage</b> of <b>her marriage contract and give</b> the money received <b>to</b> the one she injured? The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> ruling of the mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that it is <b>prohibited for a man to remain</b> living together <b>with his wife</b> for <b>even one hour without</b> her having <b>a marriage contract.</b> Therefore, the woman cannot sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> for the ruling of Rabbi Meir? It is <b>so that she will not be demeaned in his eyes such that</b> he will easily <b>divorce her,</b> as he would not suffer any adverse financial consequences by divorcing her. The Gemara asks: If that is the reason, then <b>here,</b> when she sold her marriage contract to others, the husband <b>will not</b> easily <b>divorce her, as, if he would divorce her, those who purchased</b> her marriage contract <b>will come</b> and <b>collect</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract from</b> the husband. It makes no difference to the husband whether he will have to pay the marriage contract to her or to the purchasers. Therefore, the reason for the ruling of the mishna cannot be based upon the statement of Rabbi Meir.
<b>Rather,</b> the reason she is not required to sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract to pay the one she injured is that the <b>financial advantage</b> of her marriage contract <b>is</b> mere <b>words,</b> i.e., not a specific possession, but a legal entity that simply creates the possibility to collect its value at a later date. <b>And</b> mere <b>words are not mortgaged</b> for the payment of debts, in this case her debt to the injured party.
The Gemara questions this assertion: <b>Why not?</b> Why is financial advantage not mortgaged? <b>They are words that are sold for dinars.</b> Since the financial advantage of her marriage contract has a market value, it is mortgaged to pay the debt to the injured party. <b>Rather,</b> she is not required to sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract <b>because</b> of the statement <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>one who sells a promissory note to another, and</b> the seller <b>went back and forgave</b> the debtor his debt, <b>it is forgiven,</b> and the promissory note is left valueless, since the debtor essentially had a non-transferable obligation to the creditor alone, <b>and even</b> the seller’s <b>heir can forgive</b> the debt. Since there is a concern that the woman will forgive the debt of her marriage contract after having sold it, causing a loss to the purchaser, she is not required to sell it.
The Sages <b>say:</b> Let her <b>sell</b> the financial advantage of the marriage contract <b>and give</b> the money <b>to</b> the one she injured, <b>and if she</b> happens to <b>forgive</b> the debt of her marriage contract <b>to</b> her <b>husband, she will forgive it.</b> Just as it is generally permitted for one to sell a promissory note despite the fact that he could then forgive the debt, the same should hold true in this case as well.
The Sages <b>say:</b> In <b>any</b> matter that will engender a benefit <b>to</b> her <b>husband, she</b> will <b>certainly forgive</b> the debt <b>to him</b> so that he will not have to pay the marriage contract. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>causing</b> a definite <b>loss to that purchaser through</b> direct <b>action</b> by having the woman sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract in a case where she will certainly forgive the debt, the Sages will <b>not</b> be willing to <b>cause a</b> definite <b>loss to</b> the purchaser.
The Gemara offers another suggestion: <b>And if you would say</b> that she should <b>sell</b> her marriage contract <b>to that one whom she injured</b> in order to receive the money <b>for the financial advantage,</b>

Daf 89b

so <b>that</b> even <b>if she</b> were to <b>forgive</b> the debt of her marriage contract <b>with regard to</b> her <b>husband,</b> the one she injured <b>would not lose</b> anything, <b>as now as well she is not giving him any</b> payment, one could respond that <b>ultimately,</b> in <b>any</b> matter that will engender a benefit <b>to</b> her <b>husband, she will certainly forgive</b> the debt with regard to him. <b>And we do not trouble the courts</b> to supervise the sale of the financial advantage <b>without cause.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the reason she does not sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract to obtain money with which to pay the injured party is that she would then forgive the debt of the marriage contract, then with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:22): <b>And similarly,</b> in a case where <b>she</b> was the one <b>who injured her husband she has not lost her marriage contract</b> as a result, as he does not collect compensation from the properties she brought into the marriage that are enumerated in the marriage contract, <b>why</b> does she not lose it? <b>Let her sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract to her husband</b> in order to obtain the money to compensate him <b>for that injury</b> that she caused him, <b>as, if she will forgive</b> the debt of her marriage contract <b>with regard to her husband there will be no loss</b> for the purchaser, i.e., her husband.
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is certainly</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that it is <b>prohibited for a man to remain</b> living together <b>with his wife</b> for <b>even one hour without</b> her having <b>a marriage contract.</b> Therefore, the woman cannot sell the financial advantage of her marriage contract to her husband.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> for the ruling of Rabbi Meir? It is <b>so that she will not be demeaned in his eyes such that</b> he will easily <b>divorce her,</b> and <b>here,</b> if she were to sell the marriage contract to him, <b>he would</b> then <b>divorce her and collect</b> the properties listed in the marriage contract as payment <b>for his injuries from her. If that is so, even now,</b> where she does not sell her marriage contract to him, <b>he will divorce her, and</b> once she is divorced, he will <b>collect</b> the properties listed in the marriage contract as payment <b>for his injuries from her.</b> Preventing her from selling the marriage contract to him will not serve as an impediment to his divorcing her.
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where there</b> is <b>a large</b> sum recorded in <b>her marriage contract,</b> so <b>that because</b> of <b>that slight</b> sum due him as compensation for his injuries, <b>he would not</b> be willing to <b>lose</b> the <b>large</b> sum that he would have to pay were he to divorce her. Therefore, the marriage contract does serve as an impediment to his divorcing her.
The Gemara suggests: <b>But if</b> in fact the <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where</b> the sum recorded in <b>her marriage contract</b> is <b>larger than</b> the sum recorded in <b>a marriage contract</b> required <b>by Torah law, let them establish</b> her marriage contract <b>at</b> the sum of <b>a marriage contract</b> required <b>by Torah law, and</b> with regard to <b>the other,</b> additional, sum, <b>let her sell it to</b> her husband as payment <b>for his injuries.</b> Since she will be left with a marriage contract of standard value, they would be allowed to remain living together.
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where</b> the sum recorded in <b>her marriage contract</b> is <b>not larger than</b> the sum recorded in <b>a marriage contract</b> required <b>by Torah</b> law, <b>that</b> payment for <b>his injury was</b> assessed to be <b>four dinars, and because</b> of a gain of <b>four dinars,</b> the husband would <b>not</b> be willing to <b>lose twenty-five</b> dinars, which is the value of a marriage contract required by Torah law.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in the latter case of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as she does not sell</b> her marriage contract to obtain money to pay damages <b>while she is under him,</b> i.e., married to her husband, <b>so too, she does not lose</b> the value of her marriage contract to pay damages <b>while she is under him. But</b> there are <b>times</b> when <b>she will be found to have lost</b> the value of her marriage contract, <b>and what are the circumstances?</b> It would be a case <b>where</b> the sum recorded in <b>her marriage contract</b> is <b>larger than</b> the sum recorded in <b>a marriage contract</b> required <b>by Torah law.</b> In that case she would be obligated to sell the portion of the marriage contract representing the additional amount in order to obtain money with which to compensate the one she injured.
<b>Rava said</b> in response: In <b>the latter clause</b> of that <i>baraita</i>, <b>we arrive at</b> the stipulation in the <b>marriage contract</b> that the <b>male offspring</b> inherit payment of their mother’s marriage contract, and it is not discussing the sale of a marriage contract in general.
<b>And this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching: Just as</b> the <i>halakha</i> stipulates <b>that</b> a woman <b>who sells her marriage contract to others does not lose</b> the future implementation of the stipulation in the <b>marriage contract</b> that the <b>male offspring</b> inherit payment of their mother’s marriage contract, and Rava clarifies: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The need for <b>money is what</b> caused <b>her</b> to sell it under <b>duress,</b> and she did not intend to abrogate her sons’ rights to inherit the property in the future. Rava continues his explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>So too,</b> a woman who <b>sells her marriage contract to her husband does not lose</b> the future implementation of the stipulation in the <b>marriage contract</b> that the <b>male offspring</b> inherit payment of their mother’s marriage contract, and Rava clarifies: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The need for <b>money is what</b> caused <b>her</b> to sell it under <b>duress.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to the earlier discussion and suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that the issue whether or not there was <b>an ordinance of Usha</b> instituting that the wife cannot sell her usufruct property <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>? As it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: Canaanite <b>slaves</b> that the woman brought into the marriage as <b>usufruct</b> property <b>are emancipated by</b> having <b>a tooth</b> knocked out <b>or an eye</b> blinded <b>by the woman,</b> i.e., the wife, as is the <i>halakha</i> when the owner of a slave knocks out the slave’s tooth or blinds his eye, <b>but</b> they are <b>not</b> emancipated by having a tooth knocked out or an eye blinded <b>by the man,</b> i.e., the husband, as he is not their owner. <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: The slave is <b>not</b> emancipated if his tooth was knocked out or his eye was blinded, <b>nor by the man nor by the woman.</b>
The Gemara continues its analysis: <b>They assumed that everyone</b> holds that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and to <b>its produce,</b> which the husband has with regard to usufruct property, is <b>not like ownership of the item itself,</b> which is why the husband is not considered the owner of the slaves. <b>What, is it not</b> so that the two <i>baraitot</i> <b>disagree with regard to this: That the one who says</b> that the slave is emancipated if he was struck <b>by the woman</b> holds that <b>there is no ordinance of Usha?</b> Since she retains the right to sell her usufruct property, she is considered the full owner of the slaves with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of their being emancipated. <b>And the one who says</b> that the slave is <b>not</b> emancipated if he was struck <b>by the man and not</b> if he was struck <b>by the woman</b> holds that <b>there is an ordinance of Usha.</b> Since she cannot sell her usufruct property, she is not considered to be the full owner of the slaves with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of their being emancipated.
The Gemara offers an alternative explanation: <b>No;</b> perhaps it is the case <b>that everyone</b> holds that <b>there is an ordinance of Usha. But here,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, it is referring to the time <b>before the ordinance</b> was instituted, and since the wife had the right to sell her usufruct property, she is considered the full owner of the slaves with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of their being emancipated, while <b>there,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, it is referring to the time <b>after the ordinance</b> was instituted, and since she could no longer sell her usufruct property, she is not considered to be the full owner of the slaves with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of their being emancipated.
The Gemara offers an alternative explanation: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are referring to the time <b>after the ordinance</b> was instituted, <b>and</b> the <i>tanna</i> in each <i>baraita</i> holds that <b>there is an ordinance of Usha. Rather, according to the one who says</b> that the slave is emancipated if he is struck <b>by the woman but not</b> if he is struck <b>by the man, what is the reason?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rava, as Rava said:</b>

Daf 90a

<b>Consecration</b> of an item to the Temple, the advent of the prohibition of <b>leavened bread</b> taking effect upon a leavened food, <b>and</b> the <b>emancipation</b> of a slave <b>abrogate</b> any <b>lien</b> that exists upon them. Therefore, the emancipation of a slave resulting from the knocking out of his tooth or the blinding of his eye abrogates the lien that the husband has on the slave as usufruct property, leaving the woman as the solitary owner.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>Shall we say</b> that this statement <b>of Rava is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b> According to this explanation, the <i>baraita</i> that states that the slave is not emancipated when he is struck by the woman holds that the lien of the husband is not abrogated, which would run counter to the statement of Rava. The Gemara responds: <b>No;</b> it is the case <b>that everyone agrees with</b> the statement <b>of Rava</b> that a lien is abrogated, <b>and here</b> the reason why the <i>baraita</i> holds that the husband’s lien on the slave is not abrogated is that <b>the Sages strengthened the lien of a husband</b> on his wife’s property, and it is only this type of lien that is not abrogated by emancipation.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone agrees</b> that <b>these <i>tanna’im</i></b> of the two <i>baraitot</i> <b>hold that there is no ordinance of Usha, and here, they disagree with regard to</b> the question whether <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and to <b>its produce</b> is <b>like ownership of the item itself.</b> In this case, the husband enjoys the usage of the slave while the wife owns the slave himself. The <i>baraita</i> that rules that the slave is not emancipated when struck by the woman holds that the husband is also considered to be an owner, and the <i>baraita</i> that rules that the slave is emancipated when struck by the woman holds that the husband is not considered to be an owner.
<b>And</b> the dispute with regard to the question whether ownership of the rights to use an item and to its produce is like ownership of the item itself is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who sells his</b> Canaanite <b>slave to another, and</b> he <b>contracted with him</b> that the sale is effected <b>on the condition that</b> the slave <b>will serve</b> the seller for <b>thirty days</b> before he is transferred to the purchaser, the outcome of this sale is that during those thirty days, the original master enjoys the usage of the slave and the purchaser is the owner of the slave.
As detailed in the Torah (Exodus 21:18–21), if one strikes another and the injury leads directly to the victim’s death, the one who struck him is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment. This ruling does not apply in the case where a master strikes his Canaanite slave and the slave lingers with his injuries for more than a day or two and then dies, in which case the master is exempt from court-imposed capital punishment. The <i>baraita</i> addresses who is considered the owner of the slave with regard to this latter <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that during those thirty days, only the <b>first</b> owner <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of: <b>A day or two days.</b> Rabbi Meir holds that in this case, the first owner is included in this exemption, <b>because</b> the slave <b>is under his</b> authority, as he enjoys the usage of the slave, and <b>he holds</b> that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and to <b>its produce</b> is <b>like ownership of the item itself.</b> The status of the first owner as the owner also negates the possibility that the second owner would be regarded as the owner with regard to this <i>halakha</i>, and he would not be included in the exemption.
The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that only the <b>second</b> owner <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of: <b>A day or two days, because</b> the slave <b>is his money,</b> i.e., property, but the first owner is not included in the <i>halakha</i> of: A day or two days, <b>as he holds</b> that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and to <b>its produce</b> is <b>not like ownership of the item itself.</b> Therefore, the first owner does not have the status of an owner with regard to this <i>halakha</i>.
The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <b>both of them are</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of: <b>A day or two days. This</b> one, the first owner, is included <b>because</b> the slave <b>is under his</b> authority, <b>and that</b> one, the second owner, is included <b>because</b> the slave <b>is his money.</b> The Gemara explains the reasoning of Rabbi Yosei: <b>He is uncertain,</b> with regard to <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and to <b>its produce, if</b> it is <b>like ownership of the item itself,</b> in which case only the first owner would be exempt, or <b>if</b> it is <b>not like ownership of the item itself,</b> in which case only the second owner would be exempt. <b>And</b> where there is an <b>uncertainty</b> in a case of <b>capital</b> law, the ruling is <b>to be lenient.</b> Therefore, neither of them would receive court-imposed capital punishment in this case.
The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>both of them are not</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of: <b>A day or two days,</b> and both would receive court-imposed capital punishment. <b>This</b> one, the second owner, would be liable to receive it <b>because</b> the slave <b>is not under his</b> authority, <b>and that</b> one, the first owner, would receive it <b>because</b> the slave <b>is not his money.</b> Rabbi Eliezer holds that one is required both to own the slave himself and enjoy the usage of the slave to be included in the exemption.
The Gemara notes that <b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> The <b>verse states:</b> “Notwithstanding if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished; <b>for he is his money”</b> (Exodus 21:21), and Rabbi Eliezer understands this to be referring to a slave that is <b>his money</b> alone, a slave <b>that is unique to him,</b> and therefore this exemption does not apply to one who does not have total ownership of the slave.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Ameimar says:</b> If there was <b>a man or a woman,</b> i.e., a husband or a wife, <b>who sold</b> the wife’s <b>usufruct property,</b> which is owned by the wife but used by the husband, <b>they did not accomplish anything,</b> as the sale does not take effect? <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is his statement? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> who holds that one is considered to be an owner only if he both owns the item itself and enjoys the usage of that item.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that which the Sages taught: One who is a half-slave half-freeman, and similarly, a slave belonging to two partners, are not emancipated</b> when injured by one of their owners <b>in</b> one of their <b>extremities that do not regenerate,</b> i.e., the twenty-four extremities whose injury by an owner emancipates a slave? <b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: This is what</b> the Sages <b>say in the name of Rava: It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer.</b>
He explains: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Eliezer say</b> that the term <b>“his money”</b> indicates a slave <b>that is unique to him? Here too,</b> since the verse states with regard to the emancipation of a slave resulting from his master striking him: “And if a man smite the eye of <b>his slave”</b> (Exodus 21:26), this is referring to his slave <b>that is unique to him.</b> Therefore, this <i>halakha</i> of emancipation would not apply to a slave not fully owned by one master.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who strikes another</b> must <b>give him a <i>sela</i>. Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili</b> that he must give him <b>one hundred dinars.</b> If he <b>slapped</b> another on the cheek, he must <b>give him two hundred dinars.</b> If he slapped him on the cheek with <b>the back of his hand,</b> which is more degrading than a slap with the palm, he must <b>give him four hundred dinars.</b>
If <b>he pulled his ear,</b> or <b>pulled out his hair,</b> or <b>spat</b> at him <b>and his spittle reached him,</b> or if <b>he removed</b> the other’s <b>cloak from him,</b> or if <b>he uncovered the head of a woman in the marketplace,</b> in all of these cases, he must <b>give</b> the injured party <b>four hundred dinars.</b>

Daf 90b

<b>This is the principle</b> of assessing payment for humiliation caused to another: It is <b>all</b> evaluated <b>in accordance with the honor of</b> the one who was humiliated, as the Gemara will explain. <b>Rabbi Akiva said: Even</b> with regard to the <b>poor among the Jewish people, they are viewed as though they were freemen who lost their property</b> and were impoverished. And their humiliation is calculated according to this status, <b>as they are the children of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</b> and are all of prominent lineage.
The mishna relates: <b>And an incident</b> occurred <b>involving one who uncovered the head of a woman in the marketplace,</b> and the woman <b>came before Rabbi Akiva</b> to request that he render the assailant liable to pay for the humiliation that she suffered, <b>and</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>rendered</b> the assailant <b>liable to give her four hundred dinars.</b> The man <b>said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>My teacher, give me time</b> to pay the penalty, <b>and</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>gave him time.</b>
The man then <b>waited for her</b> until <b>she was standing by the opening of her courtyard, and he broke a jug in front of her, and</b> there was the value of <b>about an <i>issar</i> of oil inside</b> the jug. The woman then <b>exposed her</b> own <b>head and she was wetting [<i>metapaḥat</i>]</b> her hand in the oil, <b>and placing her hand on her head</b> to make use of the oil.
The man <b>set up witnesses</b> to observe <b>her</b> actions, <b>and he came before Rabbi Akiva,</b> and <b>he said to him: Will I give four hundred dinars to this</b> woman for having uncovered her head? By uncovering her head for a minimal benefit, she has demonstrated that this does not cause her humiliation.
Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him: You did not say anything,</b> i.e., this claim will not exempt you. <b>One who injures himself, although it is not permitted for him</b> to do so, is nevertheless <b>exempt</b> from any sort of penalty, but <b>others who injured him</b> are <b>liable</b> to pay him. In this case as well, the man was liable to compensate the woman for shaming her, despite the fact that she did the same to herself. Similarly, <b>one who cuts</b> down <b>his</b> own <b>saplings, although it is not permitted for him</b> to do so, as this violates the prohibition of: “You shall not destroy” (see Deuteronomy 20:19), is <b>exempt</b> from any penalty, but <b>others</b> who cut down his saplings are <b>liable</b> to pay him.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, one who strikes another must pay him one hundred dinars. The Gemara clarifies this opinion. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Did <b>we learn</b> in the mishna that he must pay <b>one hundred dinars</b> of <b>Tyrian</b> coinage, <b>or</b> did <b>we learn</b> in the mishna that he must pay <b>one hundred dinars</b> of <b>state</b> coinage, which is worth one-eighth of Tyrian coinage, i.e., twelve and a half dinars of Tyrian coinage?
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof: It happened <b>that there was a certain man who struck another</b> man, and the latter <b>came before Rabbi Yehuda Nesia</b> to request an assessment for the humiliation he suffered. Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>said to</b> the assailant: <b>This is I,</b> and <b>this is Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Give him one hundred dinars</b> of <b>Tyrian</b> coinage. The Gemara suggests: <b>Conclude from</b> the incident that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna he must pay <b>one hundred dinars</b> of <b>Tyrian</b> coinage. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> it that it is so.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> did Rabbi Yehuda Nesia mean when he stated: <b>This is I,</b> and <b>this is Rabbi Yosei HaGelili? If we say</b> that <b>this is</b> what Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>said to</b> the assailant: <b>This is I, who saw you</b> strike the man, <b>and this is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says</b> that the penalty for this act is <b>one hundred dinars</b> of <b>Tyrian</b> coinage; therefore, <b>go</b> and <b>give him one hundred dinars</b> of <b>Tyrian</b> coinage, <b>is this to say that a witness can become a judge,</b> i.e., that one who witnessed an event can himself serve as a judge concerning the matter, and consequently Rabbi Yehuda Nesia was able to act as both witness and judge in the same case?
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that if there was <b>a Sanhedrin that saw one kill</b> another <b>person, some of them have become witnesses</b> and testify before the others, <b>and some of them have become judges</b> to issue a verdict; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Akiva says: They are all witnesses</b> to the act, <b>and a witness cannot become a judge.</b>
The Gemara infers from this <i>baraita</i> that even <b>Rabbi Tarfon says</b> his opinion <b>only</b> in a case <b>where some of</b> the members of the Sanhedrin <b>have become witnesses and some of them have become judges, but he did not say</b> that <b>a witness becomes a judge</b> without anyone else testifying. All the more so according to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva would it not be permitted for Rabbi Yehuda Nesia to act as a judge as well as serving as a witness.
The Gemara rejects this: One could say that <b>when that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is taught in a case <b>where</b> the Sanhedrin <b>saw</b> the murder <b>at night,</b> at which time <b>it is not</b> permitted <b>for them to practice judgment,</b> since cases of capital law may be judged only during the daytime. They were therefore not functioning as judges at that time. On the following day, testimony must be heard from some, now acting as witnesses, in front of the others, now acting as judges. By contrast, in the case of Rabbi Yehuda Nesia, he was able to serve as both the witness and the judge, as he witnessed the event while functioning as a judge.
The Gemara offers an alternative explanation: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that Rabbi Yehuda Nesia did not witness the incident, and <b>this is</b> what he <b>said to</b> the assailant: <b>This is I, that I hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says</b> that <b>one hundred dinars</b> of <b>Tyrian</b> coinage must be paid; <b>and these are witnesses who testify concerning you</b> that you struck the other. Therefore, <b>go</b> and <b>give him one hundred dinars</b> of <b>Tyrian</b> coinage.
§ The Gemara discusses the previously mentioned opinion of Rabbi Akiva: <b>But does Rabbi Akiva hold that a witness cannot become a judge?</b>
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 12:3) with regard to what is stated in the Torah concerning injuries: “And if men contend, <b>and one smite the other with a stone, or with his fist”</b> (Exodus 21:18), that <b>Shimon HaTimni says: Just as a fist is unique</b> in <b>that it is submitted to the assembly</b> of judges to assess its ability to injure <b>and to the witnesses</b> who attest that it was the fist used to strike, as a fist remains attached to the assailant, <b>so too,</b> a ruling can be issued in the case of <b>any</b> item <b>that is submitted to the assembly</b> of judges to assess its ability to injure <b>and to the witnesses</b> who attest that this was the item used to strike? This serves to <b>exclude</b> a case <b>where</b> the stone that injured <b>left the possession of the witnesses</b> and is not available to be inspected by the court to assess if it is capable of causing the purported injury.
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: But</b> is it the case that in all incidents of injury the assailant <b>struck him in the presence of the court,</b> so <b>that they know</b> exactly <b>how</b> hard <b>he struck him and on what</b> part of the body <b>he struck him,</b> e.g., <b>if</b> he struck him <b>on his thigh</b> or <b>if</b> he struck him on <b>the lobe of his heart?</b> Rather, the court relies on witnesses to testify about the injury. Therefore, the witnesses should be able to testify about the item used as well.
<b>And furthermore,</b> if <b>there</b> was one <b>who pushed another from the top of the roof or from the top of a building, and</b> the one who was pushed <b>died</b> as a result of the fall, do the members of <b>the court go to the building</b> to inspect how high it is, <b>or</b> does the <b>building go to the court?</b> Obviously neither, and the court relies upon the testimony of witnesses who state how tall the building is. <b>And furthermore, if</b> the building <b>collapsed,</b> must the court <b>rebuild it</b> in order to assess its height? The witnesses should then be able to testify about the item used as well.
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Akiva interprets the verse differently: <b>Just as a fist is unique</b> in <b>that it is submitted to the witnesses</b> for them to testify about it, <b>so too,</b> a ruling can be issued in the case of <b>any</b> item <b>that is submitted to the witnesses</b> to testify about, despite the item’s not being available for the court to assess.
This serves to <b>exclude</b> a case <b>where</b> the <b>stone</b> that injured <b>left the possession of the assailant</b> and cannot be found, and even the witnesses were unable to see it. In such a case the assailant is <b>exempt</b> from payment, since even the witnesses cannot testify about whether the stone was capable of inflicting the purported injuries.
The Gemara states its question: <b>In any event,</b> it <b>teaches</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva said to</b> Shimon HaTimni: <b>Are</b> all cases of injury such that the assailant <b>struck him in the presence of the court</b> so <b>that they know</b> exactly <b>how</b> hard <b>he struck him?</b> It can be inferred from this <b>that</b> if <b>he did</b> in fact <b>strike him in front of them,</b> Rabbi Akiva would agree that <b>a witness can become a judge.</b> This contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Akiva in the <i>baraita</i>, that a witness cannot become a judge.
The Gemara answers that there is no proof as to the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, since it may be that he <b>stated</b> his refutation <b>in accordance with the statement of Shimon HaTimni, but he himself does not hold accordingly.</b> Perhaps Rabbi Akiva himself holds that if the court had witnessed the act, they would not be able to render judgment concerning it.
The Gemara quotes a related <i>halakha</i>. <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the case of <b>an innocuous ox that killed</b> a person <b>and</b> subsequently went and <b>caused damage,</b> the court <b>judges it</b> as a case of <b>capital law</b> and the ox is killed, <b>and</b> the court <b>does not judge it</b> as a case of <b>monetary law,</b> despite the damage that it caused.
By contrast, in the case of <b>a forewarned</b> ox <b>that killed</b> a person <b>and</b> subsequently went and <b>caused damage,</b> the court <b>judges it</b> as a case of <b>monetary law,</b> and the owner is liable to pay for the damage it caused, <b>and</b> then the court <b>goes back and judges it</b> again as a case of <b>capital law,</b> and the ox is killed. But if the court <b>proceeded and judged it</b> first as a case of <b>capital law,</b> the court <b>does not go back and judge it</b> again as a case of <b>monetary law,</b> since it has already been sentenced to be killed.
The Gemara asks: <b>And if they proceeded and judged it</b> first as a case of <b>capital law, what of it? Let them go back and judge it</b> again <b>also</b> as a case of <b>monetary</b> law.
<b>Rava said: I found the Sages of the school of Rav who were sitting and saying</b> to explain this: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon HaTimni, who says</b> that <b>just as a fist is unique</b> in <b>that it is submitted to the assembly</b> of judges to assess its ability to injure <b>and to the witnesses</b> to attest that this was the fist used to strike, so too, a ruling can be issued in the case of any item that is submitted to the assembly of judges to assess its ability to injure and to the witnesses to attest that this was the item used to strike.

Daf 91a

Rava continues the report in their name: <b>Apparently, we require the evaluation of the court</b> in order to render him liable to pay for the damage. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> ox that killed, <b>once the verdict</b> was given that it to be put <b>to death, we do not delay</b> the implementation of the verdict in order to wait <b>for the evaluation of the court, and we do not delay its judgment.</b> Therefore, the monetary case is not judged.
<b>And I,</b> Rava, <b>said to</b> the Sages of the school of Rav: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who does not require assessment by the court, one could explain that <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the owner of the ox <b>fled,</b> and the court cannot judge his case in his absence and cannot render him liable to pay for the damage caused by his ox.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case where the owner <b>fled,</b> then in the case <b>where they did not</b> yet <b>judge it</b> as a case of <b>capital law, how does</b> the court <b>judge it</b> as a case of <b>monetary law without</b> the <b>owner</b> of the ox being present? The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where</b> the court <b>accepted</b> the testimony of the <b>witnesses</b> in the presence of the owner, <b>and</b> he subsequently <b>fled.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately, from where</b> are the damages <b>paid</b> in a situation where the owner fled, as he is not here to pay the damages? The Gemara answers: They are paid <b>from plowing.</b> The ox is rented out to plow fields, and the fees generated are used to pay the damages. Afterward, the ox is judged for the killing as a case of capital law. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> with regard to <b>an innocuous</b> ox, why did the <i>baraita</i> rule that the court does not judge it as a case of monetary law? The court <b>should judge it</b> as a case of <b>monetary law first, and</b> the damages <b>will be paid from</b> fees generated from renting out the animal for <b>plowing, and then</b> the court <b>should judge it</b> as a case of <b>capital law.</b>
<b>Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, said</b> in answer to this last question: <b>That is to say</b> that the money gained from <b>plowing is</b> considered like the <b>superior-quality</b> property <b>of its owner.</b> In other words, that money is like the rest of the owner’s estate, and is not considered to be part of the value of the ox itself. Since payment for damage caused by an innocuous ox is taken only from the value of the ox itself, it follows that money received from renting out the ox to plow cannot be used to pay damages.
§ In connection with the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> that the court must assess whether the death can be attributed directly to the action of the assailant, the Gemara notes: <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Is there an evaluation</b> performed <b>with regard to damage</b> as well, to determine whether the act was sufficient to inflict that damage, <b>or</b> is there <b>no evaluation</b> performed <b>with regard to damage?</b>
<b>Do we say</b> that specifically in a case <b>of killing is where we perform an evaluation?</b> The assessment is to determine whether <b>a soul departs with this</b> assault and the assailant will be held liable or whether <b>a soul doesn’t depart with this</b> assault and the death is attributed to other factors. <b>But</b> in a case of <b>damage,</b> perhaps we say that he is liable for <b>whatever</b> caused the damage. <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference</b> between the two, and with regard to damage as well, the court evaluates whether the act was sufficient to inflict that damage, and if it was not, he will be exempt.
The Gemara says: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from what was taught in a mishna (50b) concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of a pit: <b>Just as a pit that has sufficient</b> depth <b>to cause death</b> when falling into it is at least <b>ten handbreadths</b> deep, <b>so too, any</b> other excavations <b>that have sufficient</b> depth <b>to cause death</b> may be no less than <b>ten handbreadths.</b> If any of the types of excavations <b>were less than ten handbreadths</b> deep, <b>and an ox or a donkey fell into</b> one of <b>them and died,</b> the digger of the excavation is <b>exempt.</b> But if it <b>was injured in it</b> but did not die he is <b>liable</b> to pay damages.
<b>What, is it not</b> the case that the mishna <b>is counting</b> the handbreadths from <b>below to above, and this</b> is what it <b>is saying: From</b> one <b>handbreadth</b> deep <b>until ten</b> handbreadths deep, <b>there is no</b> liability for <b>death</b> but <b>there is</b> liability for <b>damage? Apparently, with regard to damage</b> he is liable for <b>whatever</b> caused the damage, even a fall into an excavation having the depth of one handbreadth. <b>Learn from</b> the mishna that the court <b>does not</b> perform <b>an evaluation with regard to damage.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> the mishna <b>is counting from above to below, and this</b> is what it <b>is saying:</b> If the excavation is <b>ten</b> handbreadths deep then <b>there is</b> liability for <b>death.</b> If the excavation is <b>slightly less than ten, there is</b> liability for <b>damage</b> but <b>there is no</b> liability for <b>death. And actually, I will say to you</b> that <b>there is an evaluation</b> performed <b>for damage, and</b> for <b>each and every</b> circumstance, <b>we require that</b> there be conditions <b>whereby</b> the injured party <b>could</b> reasonably <b>be damaged by</b> whatever caused the damage.
The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:26): If a slave owner <b>struck</b> his Canaanite slave <b>on his eye and blinded him,</b> or <b>on his ear and deafened him, the slave is emancipated by means of these</b> wounds. If he struck <b>near his eye and</b> as a result <b>he does not see,</b> or <b>near his ear and he does not hear, the slave is not emancipated by means of these</b> wounds. <b>What is the reason</b> that the slave is not emancipated? <b>Isn’t it due to</b> the fact <b>that we require an evaluation</b> of the damage, and in such a case the assumption is that the owner’s action did not suffice to cause the injury? <b>And learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>there is an evaluation</b> performed <b>with regard to damage.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No;</b> the slave is not emancipated, <b>because we say</b> that it is possible that it was the slave <b>who frightened himself,</b> resulting in his blindness or deafness, but it was not the actual strike that caused it. An injury can result from being frightened, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 6:16): <b>One who frightens another</b> and thereby causes him injury is <b>exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. How so?</b> If <b>one shouted into</b> another’s <b>ear and deafened him,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven. But if <b>he held him and shouted into his ear and deafened him,</b> he is <b>liable</b> according to human laws as well, as he physically took hold of him.
The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:3): With regard to the <b>five types of indemnity</b> that one who injures another must pay, the court <b>evaluates</b> the victim as to the value of the damage that he suffered, <b>and</b> the assailant <b>gives</b> this payment <b>to him immediately.</b> Payment for <b>medical costs and loss of livelihood</b> is evaluated from the moment of injury <b>until he is healed.</b> If the court <b>evaluated</b> that a certain sum would be needed to pay for <b>his</b> medical costs and loss of livelihood, <b>and</b> subsequently the victim’s condition began <b>progressively deteriorating</b> and the sum proved to be inadequate, <b>they give him</b> payment <b>only as they had evaluated him.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If <b>they evaluated him</b> as requiring a certain sum for medical costs and loss of livelihood <b>and he healed</b> sooner than expected, <b>they</b> nevertheless <b>give him</b> the <b>entire</b> sum <b>as they had evaluated him. Learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>there is an evaluation</b> performed <b>with regard to damage.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>With regard to evaluating</b> an injured <b>man</b> to determine <b>how</b> long <b>he will suffer from this injury</b> and <b>how</b> long <b>he will not suffer, we do not raise a dilemma,</b> since it is obvious <b>that we certainly evaluate</b> this element. <b>When we raise the dilemma</b> of whether the court performs an evaluation or not, it is <b>with regard to evaluating an item,</b> i.e., determining <b>if it</b> is capable of <b>causing this damage or</b> if it is <b>not</b> capable of causing this damage. With regard to this issue, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta, Sanhedrin</i> 12:3): <b>Shimon HaTimni says: Just as a fist is unique</b> in <b>that it is submitted to the assembly</b> of judges to assess its ability to injure <b>and to the witnesses</b> who attest that this was the fist used to strike, <b>so too,</b> a ruling can be issued in the case of <b>any</b> item <b>that is submitted to the assembly</b> of judges to identify its ability to injure <b>and to the witnesses</b> who attest that this was the item used to strike. <b>Learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>there is an evaluation</b> performed <b>with regard to damage.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that this is so.
<b>The Master said</b> above: If <b>they evaluated him</b> as requiring a certain sum for medical costs and loss of livelihood <b>and he healed</b> sooner than expected, <b>they</b> nevertheless <b>give him</b> the <b>entire</b> sum <b>as they had evaluated him.</b> This <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rava, as Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>this man whom they evaluated,</b> concluding that he would not be able to perform labor <b>for the entire day, and</b> his wounds <b>healed [<i>ve’itpaḥ</i>] at midday and he was performing labor, we give him</b> compensation <b>for the entire day.</b> The injury was one that would generally cause a man to not be able to perform labor for an entire day, and <b>it was from Heaven that they had compassion on him</b> and healed him sooner. This does not affect the liability of the one who caused the damage.
§ The mishna teaches (90a): If he <b>spat</b> at him <b>and</b> his <b>spittle reached him, or</b> if <b>he removed</b> another’s cloak, he must give the injured party four hundred dinars. <b>Rav Pappa says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case where the spittle reached <b>him. But</b> if the spittle landed <b>on his clothing</b> without touching him, he is <b>not</b> required to pay him. The Gemara asks: Why not? <b>Let it be like</b> one who <b>humiliated</b> another <b>with words.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>In the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>they say in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Avin: That is to say</b> that if <b>he humiliated</b> another <b>with words</b> alone, he is <b>exempt from</b> paying <b>anything,</b> although he will be held accountable by Heaven for his sin.
The mishna teaches with regard to the assessment of payment for humiliation: It is <b>all</b> assessed <b>in accordance with</b> the <b>honor of</b> the one who was humiliated. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> in the mishna <b>say</b> his opinion <b>as a leniency, or</b> does <b>he say</b> his opinion <b>as a stringency?</b> The Gemara explains the two possibilities: <b>He says</b> his opinion <b>as a leniency,</b> teaching <b>that there is a poor</b> person, <b>who doesn’t need to take so much</b> payment for humiliation, as detailed in the fixed sums of the mishna. <b>Or perhaps he says</b> his opinion <b>as a stringency,</b> teaching <b>that there is a rich</b> person <b>whom</b> the assailant <b>needs to give him more</b> than those fixed sums.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof <b>from that</b> which <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> in the mishna: <b>Even</b> with regard to the <b>poor of the Jewish people, they are viewed as though they were freemen who lost their property</b> and were impoverished, and their humiliation is calculated according to this status, <b>as they are the sons of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,</b> and are all of prominent lineage. <b>Conclude from</b> Rabbi Akiva’s statement that <b>the first <i>tanna</i> says</b> his opinion <b>as a leniency,</b> meaning that while the first <i>tanna</i> states the principle that payment for humiliation is in accordance with the honor of the one who was humiliated, and therefore a poor person will receive less than the fixed sums listed in the mishna, Rabbi Akiva responds that even a poor man is deserving of those fixed sums by virtue of his esteemed lineage. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that this is so.
§ The mishna relates: <b>And an incident</b> occurred <b>involving one who uncovered the head of a woman</b> in the marketplace. The woman came before Rabbi Akiva to request that he assess payment for the humiliation that she suffered, and Rabbi Akiva obligated the assailant to give her four hundred dinars. The man said to Rabbi Akiva: My teacher, give me time to pay the penalty, and Rabbi Akiva gave him time. The Gemara asks: <b>But do we give time</b> for an assailant to pay compensation? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say:</b> The court <b>does not give</b> one <b>time</b> to provide payment <b>for injuries,</b> and he must pay compensation immediately.
The Gemara answers: <b>When we do not give him time</b> to pay <b>compensation</b> it is specifically <b>with regard to injury, as he caused a monetary loss</b> by inflicting physical damage on the victim. <b>But with regard to humiliation, where he did not cause him a monetary loss, we do give</b> him time to pay compensation.
The mishna relates that the man then <b>waited for her</b> until <b>she was standing by the opening of her courtyard,</b> and caused her to uncover her own head. Rabbi Akiva said that although she caused injury to herself, which is not permitted, this does not negate the man’s requirement to pay her compensation. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Akiva said to him: You plunged into mighty waters and you raised</b> nothing more than worthless <b>earthenware in your hand,</b> since it is <b>permitted for a person to injure himself.</b> This contradicts the mishna’s account of Rabbi Akiva’s opinion.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the mishna, where it states that one may not injure himself, it is stated <b>with regard to</b> inflicting actual physical <b>injury,</b> while <b>there,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, where it states that it is permitted for one to injure himself, it is stated <b>with regard to</b> causing <b>humiliation</b> to oneself. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the ruling of Rabbi Akiva in <b>the mishna is</b> stated <b>with regard to</b> causing <b>humiliation,</b>

Daf 91b

<b>and it teaches:</b> With regard to <b>one who injures himself, although it is not permitted for him</b> to do so, he is nevertheless <b>exempt</b> from any sort of penalty, indicating that the prohibition is in effect even with regard to humiliation. The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> what Rabbi Akiva <b>said to</b> the man: <b>It is not necessary</b> to say with regard to <b>humiliation, where it is permitted for a person to humiliate himself,</b> that someone else who humiliated him is liable. <b>But even</b> with regard to <b>injury, where it is not permitted for a person to injure himself, others who injured him are liable.</b>
§ The Gemara discusses whether it is permitted to injure oneself. <b>And is a person not permitted to injure himself? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>might</b> have thought that if one <b>takes an oath to do evil to himself and did not do evil he will be exempt</b> from bringing an offering for having transgressed this oath. Therefore, <b>the verse states:</b> “Or if anyone swear clearly with his lips <b>to do evil or to do good”</b> (Leviticus 5:4), which teaches that <b>just as</b> taking an oath to <b>do good</b> for which one is liable is referring to <b>an optional</b> activity, as opposed to taking an oath to perform a mitzva, <b>so too,</b> taking an oath to <b>do evil</b> is referring to <b>an optional</b> activity, as opposed to taking an oath to transgress. <b>I</b> can therefore <b>include</b> within the category of one who is liable if he transgressed his oath the person who <b>takes an oath to do evil to himself and did not do evil</b>. It is clear from this <i>baraita</i> that doing evil to oneself is permitted.
The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel says:</b> The ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is not referring to one who takes an oath to injure himself but is stated <b>with regard to</b> one who takes an oath stating: <b>I will sit in</b> observance of <b>a fast,</b> which it is permitted to do.
Earlier in this same <i>baraita</i>, it states that one who takes an oath to do evil to others is not liable for violating his oath if he does not do evil, as it is prohibited to do evil to others. If the <i>baraita</i> is referring to one who takes an oath to fast, then <b>in the corresponding</b> situation <b>in the context of doing evil to others,</b> the <i>baraita</i> must also then be referring to one who takes an oath <b>to have</b> others <b>sit in</b> observance of <b>a fast.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Can</b> one compel <b>others</b> to <b>sit in</b> observance of <b>a fast?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes;</b> it is possible, as by preventing others from accessing food he can impose a fast on them, e.g., in a situation <b>where he confined them in a room.</b>
The Gemara questions the assertion that this is the case of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is</b> considered taking an oath to <b>do evil</b> to <b>others?</b> It is considered such if one takes an oath stating: <b>I will strike so-and-so and I will injure his brain.</b> Accordingly, in the corresponding situation of doing evil to oneself it is necessary to explain that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to causing injury as well, and the inference that this is permitted remains.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be that this <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as there is</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>who says</b> that <b>it is not permitted for a person to injure himself, and there is</b> a <i>tanna</i> <b>who says</b> that <b>it is permitted for a person to injure himself.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is the <i>tanna</i> that you heard that says: It is not permitted for a person to injure himself? If we say</b> that <b>it is this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“And surely your blood of your souls will I require”</b> (Genesis 9:5), and <b>Rabbi Elazar says: From the hand of your souls,</b> i.e., from yourself, <b>will I require your blood,</b> meaning one is liable even for taking his own life, that is not a correct inference.
<b>But perhaps killing is different.</b> While Rabbi Elazar holds that it is prohibited to take one’s own life, it cannot be inferred from here that he holds that one is liable for injuring himself.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Rather, it is</b> the opinion of <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may rend</b> garments in anguish <b>over one who died, and</b> it is <b>not</b> considered <b>of the ways of the Amorites,</b> but a Jewish custom. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: I heard that one who rends</b> his garments <b>excessively over one who died is flogged for</b> having transgressed the prohibition of: <b>Do not destroy</b> (see Deuteronomy 20:19). The Gemara suggests: <b>And all the more so</b> it is the case that according to Rabbi Elazar one who injures <b>his body</b> in anguish transgresses this prohibition.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>But perhaps garments are different,</b> in <b>that</b> tearing them <b>is a loss that is irreversible, like that</b> practice <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who would <b>refer to his garments as: My honor, and</b> like that practice of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who, <b>when he would walk among thorns and shrubs,</b> would <b>raise his clothing</b> despite the fact that his skin would get scratched by the thorns. <b>He said</b> in explanation of his actions: <b>This</b> flesh <b>will heal</b> if scratched, <b>but that</b> garment <b>will not heal</b> if torn. Similarly, perhaps it is prohibited to rend one’s garments, but it is permitted to injure oneself.
<b>Rather, it is this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Elazar HaKappar the Distinguished said: What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a nazirite: <b>“And he shall atone for him for sinning by the soul”</b> (Numbers 6:11)? <b>And with which soul did this</b> person <b>sin</b> by becoming a nazirite? <b>Rather,</b> in <b>that he afflicted himself</b> by abstaining <b>from wine</b> he is considered to have sinned with his own soul, and he must bring a sin-offering for the naziriteship itself, for causing his body to suffer. <b>And are</b> these <b>matters not</b> inferred <b><i>a fortiori</i>: And just as this</b> person <b>who afflicted himself</b> by abstaining <b>only from wine is</b> nevertheless <b>called a sinner, one who afflicts himself</b> by abstaining <b>from everything,</b> through fasting or other acts of mortification, <b>all the more so</b> is he described as a sinner? Consequently, Rabbi Elazar HaKappar holds that one may not harm himself in any manner.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One who cuts</b> down <b>his</b> own <b>saplings,</b> although it is not permitted for him to do so, is exempt from payment. Nevertheless, others who cut down his saplings are liable. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana taught</b> the following <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav:</b> If one charged another: <b>You killed my ox,</b> or: <b>You cut</b> down <b>my saplings,</b> and you are liable to pay for them, and the other responds: <b>You told me to kill</b> the ox, or: <b>You told me to cut</b> down the saplings, he is <b>exempt</b> from paying. Rav <b>said to him: If that is so, you let no creature exist. Is it in his</b> power to assert that because the other instructed him to cause damage he is exempt? With this claim, anyone who causes damage can exempt himself.
Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>said to</b> Rav: <b>Shall I erase this</b> <i>baraita</i> from the <i>baraitot</i> that I teach? Rav <b>said to him: No,</b> just <b>interpret</b> that <b>your <i>baraita</i></b> is stated <b>with regard to an ox that is ready to be killed,</b> e.g., it had gored, and the owner decided to have it killed, <b>and</b> it is stated <b>with regard to a tree that is ready to be cut</b> down for whatever reason, e.g., it was worshipped as part of an idolatrous rite or it is situated in a manner that poses a danger to the public. In such a case there is reason to believe that he was in fact instructed to cut it down.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the owner of the ox or tree acknowledges that it would be killed or cut down in any event, <b>what claim is he stating to him,</b> as there was no loss resulting from the action of the other? The Gemara answers: The case is <b>where he said to him: I desire to perform this mitzva</b> of removing a danger or destroying idolatry by myself, and therefore I am demanding payment from you for having prevented me from doing so.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states with regard to one who slaughters an undomesticated animal or a bird: <b>“He shall pour</b> out the blood thereof, <b>and he shall cover</b> it with dust” (Leviticus 17:13). This teaches that <b>the one who poured</b> the blood, i.e., the one who slaughtered, <b>shall cover</b> the blood. <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>involving one who slaughtered</b> an undomesticated animal or bird, <b>and another preempted</b> him <b>and covered</b> the blood, <b>and Rabban Gamliel deemed him liable to give ten golden coins to</b> the one who slaughtered the animal, as he prevented him from performing the mitzva.
§ In connection with the prohibition against cutting down trees the Gemara notes: <b>Rav said</b> with regard to <b>a palm tree that</b> still <b>produces</b> fruit in the amount of <b>a <i>kav</i>,</b> that it is <b>prohibited to cut it</b> down due to the prohibition of: “When you shall besiege a city…you shall not destroy the trees” (Deuteronomy 20:19).
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rav from what was taught in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 4:10): <b>How much</b> fruit must <b>be on an olive tree so</b> that one may <b>not cut it</b> down? <b>A quarter</b>-<i>kav</i>. Why did Rav say that it must produce a full <i>kav</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>Olive trees are different, since they are significant.</b> Therefore, even a quarter-<i>kav</i> is valuable.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: My son Shivḥat did not die</b> for any reason <b>other</b> than <b>that he cut</b> down <b>a fig tree before its time. Ravina says: But if</b> the lumber <b>was greater in monetary</b> value than its fruits, it is <b>permitted</b> to chop it down, and this does not violate the prohibition against destroying a tree.
<b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: “Only the trees of which you know that they are not trees for food, them you may destroy and cut down” (Deuteronomy 20:20). <b>“Only the trees of which you know”; this</b> is referring to <b>a tree</b> that bears fruit used for <b>food,</b> and it is permitted to cut down this type of tree under certain circumstances. <b>“That they are not trees for food”; this</b> is referring to <b>a barren tree.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And since</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>will ultimately include all types</b> of trees, so that even a tree that produces fruit may be cut down, <b>what,</b> then, is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “That</b> they are <b>not trees for food,”</b> which indicates that it is permitted to cut down only a barren tree? The Gemara answers: It is <b>to give precedence</b> to cutting down <b>a barren</b> tree <b>over</b> a tree whose fruit is used for <b>food.</b>

Daf 92a

One <b>might</b> have thought that he must give precedence to the cutting down of a barren tree <b>even</b> if the barren tree is <b>greater in monetary</b> value than the fruit-bearing tree. <b>The verse states: “Only,”</b> which teaches that there is an exception to the rule. Similarly, if the fruit-bearing tree itself would be worth more as lumber than for its fruits, it would be permitted for one to cut it down.
The Gemara relates: The <b>sharecropper of Shmuel brought him dates.</b> Shmuel <b>ate</b> them, and <b>tasted the taste of wine in them. He said to</b> his sharecropper: <b>What is this?</b> The sharecropper <b>said to him:</b> The date palms <b>stand among the grapevines</b> and therefore contain a taste of wine from the grapes. Shmuel <b>said:</b> Do <b>they weaken the wine,</b> i.e., the grapevines, <b>so much</b> that it is possible to taste the wine in the dates? <b>Tomorrow,</b> cut down the date palms and <b>bring me from their marrow</b> to eat.
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>Rav Ḥisda saw date palms</b> growing <b>among grapevines</b> on his estate. <b>He said to his sharecropper: Uproot the</b> date palms, since one can <b>purchase date palms</b> with <b>grapevines,</b> as grapevines are more valuable, while one <b>cannot purchase grapevines</b> with <b>date palms.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Despite</b> the fact <b>that</b> the assailant who caused damage <b>gives to</b> the victim all of the required payments for the injury, his transgression is <b>not forgiven for him</b> in the heavenly court <b>until he requests</b> forgiveness <b>from</b> the victim, <b>as it is stated</b> that God told Abimelech after he had taken Sarah from Abraham: <b>“Now therefore restore the wife</b> of the man; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for you, and you shall live” (Genesis 20:7). <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the victim <b>does not forgive him that he is cruel? As it is stated: “And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech,</b> and his wife, and his maidservants; and they bore children” (Genesis 20:17).
The mishna continues: With regard to <b>one who says</b> to another: <b>Blind my eye,</b> or: <b>cut off my hand,</b> or: <b>break my leg,</b> and he does so, the one who performed these actions is <b>liable</b> to pay for the damage, despite having been instructed to do so. Even if he explicitly instructed him: Do so <b>on the condition that</b> you will <b>be exempt</b> from payment, he is nevertheless <b>liable.</b>
With regard to one who says to another: <b>Tear my garment,</b> or: <b>break my jug,</b> and he does so, he is <b>liable</b> to pay for the damage. But if he instructed him explicitly: Do so <b>on the condition that</b> you will <b>be exempt</b> from payment, he is <b>exempt</b> from payment. If one says to another: <b>Do so,</b> i.e., cause damage, <b>to so-and-so on the condition that</b> you will <b>be exempt</b> from payment, and he did so, he is <b>liable, whether</b> the instructions were <b>with regard to</b> the victim <b>himself,</b> or <b>whether</b> the instructions were <b>with regard to his property.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught: All these</b> sums <b>that</b> in the previous mishna <b>they said</b> one is liable to pay for humiliating another are the <b>compensation for his humiliation,</b> for which there is a set amount. <b>But</b> for the victim’s <b>pain</b> caused by the assailant, <b>even if</b> the assailant <b>brings</b> as offerings <b>all the rams of Nebaioth</b> (see Isaiah 60:7) <b>that are in the world,</b> which are of the best quality, his transgression <b>is not forgiven for him</b> in the heavenly court <b>until he requests</b> forgiveness <b>from</b> the victim, <b>as it is stated: “Restore the wife of the man; for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for you”</b> (Genesis 20:7).
Having quoted the verse, the Gemara asks: Shall one infer from here <b>that the wife of a prophet needs to be returned,</b> but <b>the wife of another</b> individual <b>need not be returned?</b>
The Gemara answers. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says:</b> This is how the verse should be understood: <b>“Restore the wife of the man” in any case,</b> since she is his wife. <b>And</b> with regard to that <b>which you,</b> Abimelech, <b>said: “Will you slay even a righteous nation? Did he not say himself to me: She is my sister, and she, even she herself, said: He is my brother?”</b> (Genesis 20:4–5), the answer is that you, Abimelech, are not so righteous, since the reason Abraham said that Sarah was his sister is that <b>he is a prophet, and he already learned</b> how to conduct himself based on your behavior. As with regard to <b>a guest [<i>akhsenai</i>] who comes to town, does one ask him about matters concerning eating and drinking, or does one ask him about matters concerning his wife?</b> Does one ask a guest: <b>Is she your wife? Is she your sister?</b> Abimelech was to be blamed, since Abraham thought that he intended to steal his wife.
The Gemara remarks: <b>From here</b> it can be derived <b>that a gentile is executed</b> for having transgressed a prohibition without awareness that the act was prohibited, <b>since he should have learned and he did not learn.</b>
Having mentioned the verses concerning the incident of Abraham and Abimelech, the Gemara explains other related verses. <b>“For the Lord had obstructed [<i>atzor atzar</i>]</b> all the wombs of the house of Abimelech” (Genesis 20:18). <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Why</b> are <b>these two obstructions [<i>atzor atzar</i>]</b> both stated? <b>One</b> is stated <b>with regard to a man,</b> that <b>semen</b> will not be discharged, and <b>two</b> are stated <b>with regard to a woman,</b> that <b>semen</b> will not be discharged from her, <b>and</b> that she will not give <b>birth.</b>
It <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: Two</b> are stated <b>with regard to a man: Semen and urine,</b> i.e., that the men were unable to both urinate and discharge semen; <b>three</b> are stated <b>with regard to a woman: Semen, and urine, and birth.</b>
<b>Ravina says: Three</b> are stated <b>with regard to a man: Semen, and urine, and</b> the <b>anal sphincter,</b> i.e., that they were unable to discharge stool as well. Consequently, they would be unable to relieve themselves at all. <b>Four</b> are stated <b>with regard to a woman: Semen, and birth, and urine, and</b> the <b>anal sphincter.</b>
The verse states: “For the Lord had obstructed <b>all the wombs</b> of the house of Abimelech.” The Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai say: Even a hen of the house of Abimelech did not lay her egg</b> during that time.
§ The Gemara cites a series of questions that Rava asked Rabba bar Mari, the first one being related to the previous topic of discussion. <b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby the Sages stated: Anyone who asks</b> for <b>compassion</b> from Heaven <b>on</b> behalf of <b>another, and he requires</b> compassion from Heaven <b>concerning that same matter, he is answered first?</b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source for this is <b>as it is written: “And the Lord changed the fortune of Job, when he prayed for his friends”</b> (Job 42:10).
Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a verse in the Writings, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah. As it is written: <b>“And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maidservants,</b> and they bore children” (Genesis 20:17), <b>and it is written</b> immediately following that: <b>“And the Lord remembered Sarah, as He had said”</b> (Genesis 21:1), with the pronoun interpreted homiletically: <b>As Abraham said with regard to Abimelech.</b> Because Abraham prayed for Abimelech that the women of his household should give birth, Abraham himself was answered concerning that matter.
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: The cabbage is damaged together with the thorn,</b> since the cabbage is sometimes harmed when the thorn is removed? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written: “Why will you contend with Me? You all have transgressed against Me, says the Lord”</b> (Jeremiah 2:29). The term “you all” includes even those who have not sinned.
Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a verse in the Prophets, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah. The Lord said to Moses after some of the people collected the manna on Shabbat: <b>“How long do you refuse [<i>me’antem</i>] to keep My commandments and My laws?”</b> (Exodus 16:28). The term “you refuse [<i>me’antem</i>]” is written in the plural, indicating that even Moses was included, although he did not sin.
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: It is written</b> with regard to Joseph: <b>“And from among his brothers he took five men,</b> and presented them to Pharaoh” (Genesis 47:2). <b>Who are these five</b> men? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him: This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Those whose names were repeated</b> in the blessings with which Moses later blessed the twelve tribes. They are Dan, Zebulun, Gad, Asher, and Naftali (see Deuteronomy 35). Since they were weak, Joseph brought them before Pharaoh.
Rava said: <b>Judah also</b> had his name <b>repeated</b> in the blessings, and he was strong.
Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him: His</b> name <b>was repeated for his</b> own <b>matter, as Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> concerning Reuben and Judah in Moses’ blessing of the tribes at the end of his life: <b>“Let Reuben live and not die in that his men become few”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:6), and immediately afterward in the following verse it states: <b>“And this for Judah,</b> and he said: Hear Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him in unto his people; may his hands fight on his behalf, and You shall be a help against his adversaries” (Deuteronomy 33:7)? What is the connection between the blessing of Reuben and that of Judah, juxtaposed with the conjunction “and”?
Rabbi Yoḥanan said: <b>All those forty years that the Jewish people were in the desert, the bones of Judah,</b> which the Jewish people took with them from Egypt along with the bones of his brothers, <b>were rolling</b> around <b>in the coffin, until Moses came and asked for mercy</b> on Judah’s behalf. Moses <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, who</b> served as the <b>impetus for Reuben that he should confess</b> his sin, through which he merited a blessing and was not excluded from the count of the twelve sons of Jacob (see Genesis 35:22)? It was <b>Judah,</b> as Reuben saw him confess his sin, and thereby did the same.
<b>Immediately</b> after Moses prayed, the verse states: <b>“Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:7). <b>His bones</b> then <b>entered</b> their <b>sockets [<i>leshafa</i>],</b> and his skeleton became attached. The angels still <b>did not elevate</b> him <b>into the heavenly study hall.</b> Moses then prayed: <b>“And bring him in unto his people”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:7), i.e., bring him to those in the heavenly study hall. This prayer was accepted, but <b>he</b> still <b>did not know what the sages were saying, and</b> he was unable <b>to deliberate</b> in Torah matters <b>with the sages.</b> Moses then prayed: <b>“May his hands fight on his behalf”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:7), meaning that he should have the ability to contend with them in study. But still <b>he was unable to draw</b> conclusions from <b>his discussion in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>.</b> Moses then prayed: <b>“And You shall be a help against his adversaries”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:7).
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: Poverty follows the poor?</b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him: As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 3:8): <b>Rich</b> people would <b>bring first fruits in baskets of gold and of silver, and poor</b> people would bring first fruits <b>in wicker baskets</b> made <b>of peeled willow,</b> and <b>they would give the baskets and the first fruits to the priests.</b> The rich would have their baskets returned to them, while the poor would not. Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a mishna, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah:

Daf 92b

The verse states with regard to one diagnosed with leprosy: “And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and the hair of his head shall go loose, and he shall cover his upper lip, <b>and he shall cry: Unclean, unclean”</b> (Leviticus 13:45). Not only must the leper suffer from the leprosy itself; he must undergo further embarrassment by publicizing his condition. This is akin to the aphorism that poverty follows the poor.
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby the Sages stated: Awaken early and eat, in the summer due to the heat and in the winter due to the cold. And</b> similarly, <b>people say: Sixty runners run and do not reach the man who ate in the morning.</b> Rabba bar Mari said to him that the source is <b>as it is written: “They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them”</b> (Isaiah 49:10), indicating that one who is not hungry or thirsty will not be affected by the weather.
Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a verse in the Prophets, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah. The verse states: “And you shall serve the Lord your God, and He will bless your bread and your water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of you” (Exodus 23:25). Rava explicates: <b>“And you shall serve the Lord your God”; this</b> is referring to the <b>recitation of <i>Shema</i> and prayer. “And He will bless your bread and your water”; this</b> is referring to <b>bread</b> dipped <b>in salt, and a flask of water</b> drunk after the bread, in the mornings. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward</b> the remainder of the verse applies: <b>“And I will take sickness away from the midst of you.”</b>
<b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“Sickness”; this</b> is referring to <b>bile. And why is its name called sickness [<i>maḥala</i>]?</b> It is called this <b>since there are eighty-three sicknesses in</b> bile. The letters spelling the word <b><i>maḥala</i>,</b> i.e., <i>mem</i>, <i>ḥet</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>heh</i>, <b>have that numerical value</b> of eighty-three. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all of those</b> sicknesses, eating <b>bread</b> dipped <b>in salt</b> in the <b>morning and</b> drinking <b>a flask of water</b> afterward <b>negates them.</b>
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby the Sages stated:</b> If <b>your friend calls you a donkey, prepare a saddle for your back,</b> i.e., do not contest his statement? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> in the conversation between the angel and Hagar: <b>“And he said: Hagar, maidservant of Sarai, from where did you come and to where are you going? And she said: I am fleeing from the face of my mistress Sarai”</b> (Genesis 16:8). Though Hagar was no longer the maidservant of Sarai, since the angel referred to her as such, she responded in kind.
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say:</b> If you are aware of <b>a derogatory matter that is</b> found <b>in you, say it first</b> before others say it about you? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to Eliezer: <b>“And he said: I am Abraham’s servant”</b> (Genesis 24:34), immediately proclaiming that he is a servant.
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: The goose stoops</b> its head <b>as it goes</b> along, <b>but its eyes</b> look <b>afar</b> to find food for itself? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to Abigail’s statement to David: <b>“And when the Lord shall have dealt well with my lord, then remember your maidservant”</b> (I Samuel 25:31). Although Abigail spoke with humility in her request that David spare her husband’s life, she made reference to deriving future benefit from David.
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: Sixty discomforts come to the teeth [<i>lekhakha</i>]</b> of one <b>who hears the sound of another</b> eating <b>and does not eat?</b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to what Nathan the prophet said concerning the coronation banquet of Adonijah, to which he was not invited: “For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king’s sons…<b>But me, even me your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he has not called”</b> (I Kings 1:25–26).
Rava <b>said to him: You said</b> the proof <b>from there,</b> from a verse in the Prophets, <b>and I say</b> the proof <b>from here,</b> from a verse in the Torah. As it is written: <b>“And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her, and Isaac was comforted for his mother”</b> (Genesis 24:67). <b>And it is written</b> immediately <b>afterward: “And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah”</b> (Genesis 25:1). After seeing his son marry, Abraham was disquieted by the fact he was not married. This is akin to one who sees another eating and does not eat.
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say:</b> While <b>the wine</b> belongs <b>to its owner, the gratitude</b> is given <b>to the one who pours it?</b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to God commanding Moses to transfer his authority to Joshua: “And the Lord said unto Moses: Take you Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is spirit, <b>and lay your hand upon him…that all the congregation of the children of Israel may hearken”</b> (Numbers 27:18–20). <b>And it is written: “And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel hearkened unto him,</b> and did as the Lord commanded Moses” (Deuteronomy 34:9). Although the spirit of God was not given to Joshua by Moses, as Moses was only a conduit, he was given credit for it.
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: A dog, in its hunger, swallows</b> even <b>dung?</b> Rabba bar Mari said to him that the source is <b>as it is written: “The full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet”</b> (Proverbs 27:7).
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: A bad palm tree strolls and goes</b> to be <b>among a grove of barren trees,</b> i.e., bad people seek out other bad people? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him: This matter is written in the Torah, repeated in the Prophets, and triplicated in the Writings, and we learned</b> it <b>in a mishna, and we learned</b> it <b>in a <i>baraita</i>.</b>
Rabba bar Mari explains each of the sources. It <b>is written in the Torah, as it is written: “And so Esau went to Ishmael”</b> (Genesis 28:9). It <b>is repeated in the Prophets, as it is written: “And there were gathered vain fellows to Yiftah, and they went out with him”</b> (Judges 11:3). <b>And</b> it <b>is triplicated in the Writings, as it is written: All fowl will live with its kind, and men with those like him</b> (Book of Ben Sira 13:17). <b>We learned</b> it <b>in a mishna</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 12:2): <b>All that is attached to</b> that which is <b>ritually impure</b> is <b>ritually impure; all that is attached to</b> that which is <b>ritually pure</b> is <b>ritually pure. And we learned</b> it <b>in a <i>baraita</i>: Rabbi Eliezer says: Not for naught</b> did the <b>starling go to the raven but because it is its kind,</b> as it too is a non-kosher bird.
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say:</b> If <b>you called</b> to <b>your friend and he did not answer you, throw a large wall</b> and <b>cast it at him,</b> i.e., do not attempt to help him anymore? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is as it is written: <b>“Because I have purged you and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your impurity anymore,</b> until I have satisfied My fury upon you” (Ezekiel 24:13).
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say:</b> If there is <b>a well that you drank from, do not throw a stone into it?</b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written: “You shall not abhor an Edomite, for he is your brother; you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you were a stranger in his land”</b> (Deuteronomy 23:8). Since you dwelled in their lands, you may not cause them harm.
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: If you lift the load</b> with me <b>I will lift</b> it, <b>and if</b> you will <b>not</b> lift it with me <b>I won’t lift</b> it? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written</b> with regard to Barak and Deborah concerning the war of Sisera: <b>“And Barak said to her: If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go”</b> (Judges 4:8).
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: When we were small,</b> we were considered <b>to</b> be <b>men; now that we are old,</b> we are considered <b>to</b> be <b>children [<i>ledardekei</i>]?</b> Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is that <b>initially, it is written</b> with regard to the Jewish people traveling in the wilderness: <b>“And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light”</b> (Exodus 13:21). God Himself guarded over the Jewish people. <b>But at the end,</b> after some time passed and it would be expected that the Jewish people were considered more important, <b>it is written:</b>

Daf 93a

<b>“Behold, I send an angel before you, to keep you by the way”</b> (Exodus 23:20), indicating that an angel was sent in place of God to guard the Jewish people.
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari: From where is this matter</b> derived <b>whereby people say: Drag wood after a property owner.</b> In other words, help out a wealthy man even in a small way, as this may lead to your benefiting from him. Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him</b> that the source is <b>as it is written: “And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents”</b> (Genesis 13:5).
§ In connection with the incident of Abraham and Abimelech mentioned in the mishna, the Gemara quotes a related statement. <b>Rabbi Ḥanan says: One who passes</b> the <b>judgment of another</b> to Heaven <b>is punished first, as it is stated: “And Sarai said to Abram: My wrong be upon you,</b> I gave my handmaid into your bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: The Lord judge between me and you” (Genesis 16:5). Sarai stated that God should judge Abram for his actions. <b>And it is written: “And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her”</b> (Genesis 23:2), as Sarah died first. The Gemara comments: <b>And this matter applies</b> only in a situation <b>where he has</b> someone to do <b>judgment</b> for him <b>on earth</b> and has no need to appeal to the heavenly court.
Concerning this, <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Woe to he who cries</b> out to Heaven <b>more than the one about whom</b> he is <b>crying</b> out. The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> concept <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Both the <b>one who cries</b> out <b>and the one about whom</b> he is <b>crying</b> out <b>are included</b> in the verse discussing the cries of an orphan who is mistreated: “If you afflict them, for if they cry at all to Me, I will surely hear their cry. My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword” (Exodus 22:22–23). <b>But they are quicker</b> to punish <b>the one who cries</b> out <b>than the one about whom</b> he is <b>crying</b> out, as in the incident with Sarai.
The Gemara provides another lesson from the story of Abraham and Abimelech. <b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The curse of an ordinary person should never be</b> regarded as <b>light in your eyes, for Abimelech cursed Sarah and it was fulfilled in her descendant.</b> The curse on Sarah is <b>as it is stated: “Behold, it is to you a covering of the eyes”</b> (Genesis 20:16), meaning that <b>he said to her: Since you concealed</b> your status <b>from me and you did not reveal that</b> Abraham <b>is your husband, and you caused me this suffering, may it be</b> God’s <b>will that you should have children with covered eyes. And</b> this curse <b>was fulfilled in her descendant, as it is written: “And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see”</b> (Genesis 27:1).
<b>Rabbi Abbahu says: A person should always be among those who are pursued and not among the pursuers.</b> One can prove that this is so, <b>as none among birds are pursued more than doves and pigeons,</b> as all predators hunt them, <b>and</b> from all birds <b>the verse deemed them fit to</b> be sacrificed on the <b>altar.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>one who says</b> to another: <b>Blind my eye,</b> or: Cut off my hand, or: Break my leg, and he does so, the latter is liable to pay for the damage, even if the injured party explicitly instructed him to do so on the condition that he will be exempt from payment. But if one instructs another to damage his property on the condition that he will be exempt from payment, he is exempt. <b>Rav Asi bar Ḥama said to Rava: What is different</b> in <b>the first clause and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause?</b>
Rava <b>said to him:</b> In the case of <b>the first clause</b> he is liable, despite the fact that he was instructed to carry out the injury on the condition that he would be exempt, <b>because a person does not forgo</b> compensation <b>for</b> damage to his <b>extremities</b> such as his eyes, hands, and feet, mentioned in the mishna (92a). Consequently, when he told the assailant that he would be exempt, the presumption is that he was not sincere.
Rav Asi bar Ḥama <b>said to him: But does a person forgo</b> compensation <b>for his pain</b> when he doesn’t lose a limb? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who said to another: <b>Strike me,</b> or <b>wound me, on the condition that</b> you will <b>be exempt</b> from payment, he is <b>exempt.</b> According to Rava’s reasoning, he should be liable in this case as well, as the presumption should be that he was not sincere. Rava <b>was silent,</b> as he did not have a response.
Rava <b>said</b> to him: <b>Have you heard anything with regard to this</b> matter? Rav Asi bar Ḥama <b>said to him</b> that <b>this is what Rav Sheshet said:</b> It is <b>because</b> loss of a limb may result in <b>a family flaw,</b> i.e., it may cause harm to the family name. One who loses a limb not only suffers pain; his family suffers as well. He is not in a position to forgive the assailant for the harm caused to his family, but he may forgo compensation for his own pain. Consequently, if he instructed another merely to injure him, without causing loss of limb, on condition that the assailant will be exempt from payment, the assailant will be exempt.
It <b>was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed concerning the explanation for the ruling of the first clause of the mishna. <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> It is <b>because</b> loss of a limb may result in <b>a family flaw. Rava says:</b> It is <b>because a person does not forgo</b> compensation <b>for</b> damage to <b>his extremities.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: There is a yes that,</b> based on other factors, <b>is like a no</b> and is not viewed as giving consent. <b>And</b> conversely, <b>there is a no that,</b> based on other factors, <b>is like a yes,</b> and although one said no it is as though he gave consent. In this case as well, where he said: On condition to be exempt, he was not sincere.
The Gemara comments that <b>this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>. With regard to one who said to another: <b>Strike me,</b> or <b>wound me;</b> and the other asks: Is this <b>on the condition that</b> I will <b>be exempt</b> from payment? <b>And</b> the first one <b>said to him,</b> in the tone of a question: <b>Yes,</b> this is an example of the principle: <b>There is a yes that is like a no.</b> It is as if the victim asked: Even if I give you permission to do it, do you think that I would forgo the compensation? By contrast, if one said: <b>Tear my garment,</b> and the other asks: Is this <b>on the condition that</b> I will <b>be exempt</b> from payment? <b>And he said to him,</b> in the tone of a question: <b>No, this</b> is an example of <b>a no that is like a yes,</b> since he meant to say that if he did not want to exempt him from payment he would not ask him to do it.
§ The mishna teaches that if one instructed another: <b>Break my jug,</b> or: <b>Tear my garment,</b> and the other did so, he is <b>liable</b> to pay for the damage. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verses state with regard to bailees: “If a man delivers to his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard” (Exodus 22:6), and: “If a man delivers to his neighbor an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to safeguard” (Exodus 22:9). The Sages derived from these verses that the bailee is liable if the item was given to him <b>to safeguard, but not</b> where it was given to him <b>to destroy;</b> if it was given to him <b>to safeguard, but not</b> where it was given to him <b>to tear;</b> if it was given to him <b>to safeguard, but not</b> where it was given to him <b>to distribute to the poor.</b> This indicates that a bailee is not liable for damage to an item if he was told to tear it, even if the owner did not state that it is on condition to be exempt.
<b>Rav Huna said:</b> This is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> mishna that obligates him to pay for the damage is dealing with a case <b>where it came into his possession,</b> and he was responsible for it before the owner instructed him to tear it. Therefore, even if he was instructed to tear it, he is liable. And <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which exempts him from paying, is discussing a case <b>where it did not come into his possession,</b> but he simply tore it.
<b>Rabba said to</b> Rav Huna: But the phrase in the verse <b>“to safeguard,”</b> which obligates a bailee, <b>indicates that it came into his possession</b> already, and this is the case of the <i>baraita</i> that rules he is exempt.
<b>Rather, Rabba said: This and that</b> are discussing a case <b>where it came into his possession, and</b> it is <b>not difficult. This</b> mishna is discussing a case <b>where it came into his possession as</b> an item given for <b>safeguarding,</b> and he is exempt if the owner stated explicitly that this will be the case, and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where it came into his possession as</b> an item given for <b>tearing.</b>
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain purse</b> full <b>of charity</b> money <b>that came to</b> the city of <b>Pumbedita. Rav Yosef deposited it with a certain man.</b> That man <b>was negligent in</b> safeguarding <b>it</b> and <b>thieves came</b> and <b>stole it. Rav Yosef deemed</b> the bailee <b>liable</b> to pay compensation. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>To safeguard, but not</b> where it was given to him <b>to distribute to the poor?</b> This seems to teach that with regard to money that is distributed to the poor, there is no <i>halakha</i> of safeguarding.
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: The poor of Pumbedita</b> have an amount that is <b>set for them</b> to receive. Each poor person already had a specific sum designated for him, <b>and</b> accordingly <b>is</b> in the category of: <b>To safeguard.</b> Therefore, he is liable.

Daf 93b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who robs</b> another of <b>wood and fashions it</b> into <b>vessels,</b> or one who robs another of <b>wool and fashions it</b> into <b>garments,</b> he <b>pays</b> the robbery victim <b>according to</b> the value of the goods at the <b>time of the robbery,</b> but he need not return the vessels or garments. He has acquired the stolen items because they had undergone a change.
If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>a pregnant cow and it</b> then <b>gave birth</b> while in his possession, or if one robbed another of <b>a ewe</b> that was <b>laden</b> with wool <b>and</b> the robber then <b>sheared it,</b> the robber <b>pays</b> the <b>value of a cow that is ready to give birth or</b> the <b>value of a ewe that is ready to be shorn.</b> He pays the value of the animal at the time of the robbery, and the calf or the wool remains his.
If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>a cow, and it became pregnant in his</b> possession, <b>and it</b> then <b>gave birth;</b> or if one robbed another of <b>a ewe, and it became laden</b> with wool <b>in his</b> possession, <b>and</b> he then <b>sheared it,</b> then the robber <b>pays according to</b> the value of the animal at the <b>time of the robbery. This is the principle: All robbers pay according to</b> the value of the stolen item at the <b>time of the robbery.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages <b>say:</b> It can be inferred from the mishna that if one robbed another of <b>wood and fashioned it into vessels, yes,</b> the robber acquires the wood due to the change. If he merely <b>sanded it, no,</b> the robber does not acquire it, as this is not a significant change. Similarly, if one robbed another of <b>wool and fashioned it</b> into <b>garments, yes,</b> he has acquired the wool due to the change. If <b>he</b> merely <b>washed it, no,</b> he has not acquired it.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>wood and sanded it,</b> or <b>stones and smoothed them,</b> or <b>wool and washed it,</b> or <b>flax and cleaned it, he pays according to</b> the value of the stolen item at the <b>time of the robbery.</b> This <i>baraita</i> teaches that even a change such as sanding wood is regarded as a significant change.
<b>Abaye said:</b> This does not contradict the mishna. <b>The <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a change</b> deemed significant <b>by rabbinic</b> law, which is not deemed significant by Torah law, <b>as it is reversible. And all the more so,</b> if the robber effects <b>a change</b> deemed significant <b>by Torah</b> law, i.e., an irreversible change, he acquires the stolen item due to the change.
The Gemara explains: Accordingly, it must be that the case in the mishna, where the change is reversible, where one robbed another of <b>wood and fashioned it into vessels,</b> is stated <b>with regard to</b> one who robbed another of <b>sanded wood. And what are they? Boards</b> that the robber used to construct a vessel, <b>which is a change</b> in which the item <b>can revert to its original state, as, if</b> the robber <b>desires, he</b> can <b>disassemble them.</b> Similarly, the case of one who robbed another of <b>wool and fashioned it into garments</b> refers <b>to wool</b> that was already <b>spun, as</b> fashioning them into garments <b>is a change</b> in which the item <b>can revert to its original state, as, if</b> the robber <b>desires, he</b> can <b>unravel them.</b> The mishna teaches that the robber acquires the stolen item by making these changes, <b>and all the more so</b> the robber acquires the stolen item through <b>a change</b> deemed significant <b>by Torah law.</b>
Abaye continues his explanation: <b>And the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a change</b> deemed significant <b>by Torah law, but he does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a change</b> deemed significant <b>by rabbinic law.</b> It is possible that he maintains that the robber does not acquire the stolen item due to such a change.
<b>Rav Ashi stated</b> another answer: <b>The <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>is also teaching</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a change</b> deemed significant <b>by Torah law.</b> The case in the mishna of one who robbed another of <b>wood and fashioned it</b> into <b>vessels</b> is referring to one who constructed <b>pestles [<i>bukhanei</i>], which is</b> analogous to the case mentioned in the <i>baraita</i> where <b>one sanded them,</b> since a pestle is formed by trimming the wood in an irreversible manner. Similarly, the case in the mishna of one who robbed another of <b>wool and fashioned it into garments</b> is referring to one who fashioned the wool into pieces of <b>felt [<i>namtei</i>], which is an irreversible change.</b>
The Gemara asks a question with regard to the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But does washing</b> effect a significant <b>change,</b> so that one who robs another of wool and washes it acquires the wool and pays its value at the time of robbery? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna that discusses the <i>halakhot</i> of the first of the sheared wool, which one must give to a priest (<i>Ḥullin</i> 135a): If the owner of the sheep <b>did not manage to give</b> the sheared wool <b>to</b> the priest <b>before he dyed it,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from giving it to the priest, as the obligation is in effect only with regard to wool remaining in its original state. By contrast, if <b>he washed it but did not dye it,</b> he is <b>obligated</b> to give it to the priest. This indicates that washing does not effect a significant change.
<b>Abaye said:</b> It is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> whereas <b>that</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the first of the sheared wool: If one <b>sheared it, spun it, and wove it,</b> the sheared wool <b>does not combine</b> with the wool from other sheep to constitute the minimum quantity of wool for which one is obligated to give the first of the sheared wool to the priest. If one <b>washed it,</b> then <b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that it <b>does not combine</b> with the wool of other sheep, as washing effects a significant change, <b>and the Rabbis say that</b> it <b>combines</b> with the wool of other sheep, as washing does not effect a significant change. Their opinions correspond to the opinions in the <i>baraita</i> and mishna previously quoted.
<b>Rava stated</b> another answer: <b>This and that,</b> i.e., both the mishna and the <i>baraita</i>, are in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, and</b> it is <b>not difficult. This</b> mishna is referring to a case <b>where one untangled</b> the strands of wool by hand before washing it. In this case, the washing is not fully effective, and does not effect a significant change. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where one combed it</b> before washing it. The washing is more effective and consequently effects a significant change.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin stated</b> another answer: <b>This</b> mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> one merely <b>whitened it,</b> which is not a significant change. <b>That</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where one bleached it</b> with sulfur, which is a significant change.
Having demonstrated that, according to Rabbi Shimon, washing effects a significant change, the Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that <b>it can be said</b> that, according <b>to Rabbi Shimon, dye does not</b> effect a significant <b>change,</b> as the Gemara will prove, can it be said that <b>washing</b> effects a significant <b>change? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If he <b>sheared</b> sheep <b>one by one and dyed</b> the wool of each sheep before shearing the next sheep, or sheared them <b>one by one and spun</b> the wool, or sheared them <b>one by one and wove</b> the wool, then the wool sheared from the different sheep <b>does not combine</b> to constitute the minimum quantity of wool for which one is obligated to give the first of the sheared wool to the priest. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon:</b> Even if he <b>dyed it,</b> it <b>combines</b> with the other wool. This indicates that, according to Rabbi Shimon, even dyeing the wool is not a significant change, so how could he maintain that washing it is?
<b>Abaye said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, that washed wool does not combine with other wool, is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon,</b> while <b>that</b> statement, that even dyed wool combines with other wool, is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon.</b> There is a dispute as to what Rabbi Shimon rules with regard to this issue.
<b>Rava said: Actually, the Rabbis do not disagree with Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda,</b> and they are also of the opinion that Rabbi Shimon holds that washing effects a significant change. <b>And</b> as for the apparent contradiction, <b>dye is different</b> and it does not effect a significant change, <b>since one is able to remove it with soap [<i>tzafon</i>]</b> and return the wool to its previous state. <b>And when it is taught there,</b> in the mishna cited above, that if <b>one did not manage to give</b> the sheared wool <b>to</b> the priest <b>before he dyed it he is exempt, and</b> this ruling <b>was established in accordance with all opinions,</b> it was not stated with regard to ordinary dye but <b>with regard to indigo, which cannot be removed</b> with soap and therefore effects a permanent and therefore significant change.
§ <b>Abaye said: Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda, and Beit Shammai, and Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, and Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, and Rabbi Yishmael all hold</b> that despite <b>a change,</b> the changed item <b>remains in its place,</b> i.e., the changed item is still considered to have the status it had before the change. The Gemara proceeds to prove that each of these <i>tanna’im</i> holds this way: The opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda</b> is <b>that which we</b> just <b>said.</b> He says that, according to Rabbi Shimon, even if the wool is dyed it still combines with the wool of other animals to constitute the minimum quantity of wool for which one is obligated to give the first of the sheared wool to the priest.
<b>What is</b> the source that indicates that <b>Beit Shammai</b> maintain that an item that undergoes a change is considered to have the same status that it had before the change? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>gave</b> a prostitute <b>wheat as her payment, and she</b> ground it and <b>converted it into flour;</b> or if he gave her <b>olives, and she</b> squeezed them and <b>converted them into oil;</b> or if he gave her <b>grapes, and she</b> squeezed them and <b>converted them into wine;</b> and if, in any of these cases, she subsequently consecrated the final product, <b>it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>prohibited</b> to sacrifice them upon the altar as a meal-offering or libation, as the Torah states: “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot or the price of a dog into the House of the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19). <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that it is <b>permitted,</b> as the Gemara will explain. <b>And Rav Yosef says:</b> It was <b>taught</b> by <b>Guryon</b>

Daf 94a

<b>of Asporak: Beit Shammai prohibit</b> sacrificing these items <b>and Beit Hillel permit</b> doing so. The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is the reason of Beit Shammai?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The verse states:</b> “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot or the price of a dog into the House of the Lord your God for any vow; for <b>even both of these</b> are an abomination unto the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 23:19). The word “even” is an amplification, which serves <b>to include</b> in the prohibition these items in <b>their changed</b> form. <b>And</b> what is the reason of <b>Beit Hillel? The verse states “these”</b> to emphasize that the prohibition applies only to these items in their initial form, <b>but not</b> in <b>their changed</b> form.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Beit Shammai, isn’t</b> the word <b>“these” written</b> in the verse, indicating an exclusion? The Gemara responds: Beit Shammai <b>requires that</b> word to indicate that <b>“these”</b> items are forbidden, <b>but not</b> the <b>offspring</b> of animals given as payment to the prostitute. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Beit Hillel,</b> what is the source of that <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: According to Beit Hillel, <b>you learn two</b> <i>halakhot</i> <b>from this</b> word, as follows: <b>“These”</b> items are forbidden in their initial form <b>but not</b> in <b>their changed</b> form, and <b>“these”</b> items are forbidden <b>but not their offspring.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Beit Hillel as well, isn’t</b> the word <b>“even” written</b> in the verse, indicating an amplification? The Gemara answers: Indeed, the word <b>“even” is difficult for Beit Hillel.</b> It is not clear how they would interpret that word.
The Gemara continues: <b>What is</b> the source that indicates that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov</b> holds that an item that undergoes a change is still considered to have the same status that it had before the change?
The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says:</b> In the case of one <b>who robbed</b> another of <b>a <i>se’a</i> of wheat,</b> then <b>ground it, kneaded it, and baked it, and</b> he then <b>separated <i>ḥalla</i> from it,</b> i.e., he separated the portion of the dough that one is required to separate and then give to a priest, <b>how</b> can he <b>recite the blessing</b> over the separation of <i>ḥalla</i>? <b>This</b> individual is <b>not reciting a blessing,</b> but <b>rather</b> he is <b>blaspheming. And with regard to this it is stated: “The robber who recites a blessing blasphemes the Lord”</b> (Psalms 10:3), which is referring to a robber who recites a blessing upon performing a mitzva with an item he stole. According to Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov, although this wheat has been significantly changed, it is still considered a stolen item.
The Gemara continues: <b>What is</b> the source that indicates that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar</b> holds that an item that undergoes a change is still considered to have the same status that it had before the change? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:2) that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar stated this principle:</b> With regard to <b>any enhancement</b> to the stolen animal in <b>that</b> it <b>was enhanced</b> by the actions of the <b>robber, he has the advantage</b> when repaying the owner. If <b>he desires, he takes his enhancement,</b> i.e., when he returns the animal, the robbery victim must pay the difference between its value at the time of the robbery and its current value, and <b>if he desires</b> he can return it to the owner and <b>say to him: That which is yours is before you.</b>
The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>What is he saying?</b> If the robber has a right to demand compensation for the enhancement to the animal, why would he ever return it without stating this demand? <b>Rav Sheshet said</b> that <b>this is</b> what he <b>is saying:</b> If the robber <b>enhanced it, he takes his enhancement.</b> If the animal was <b>weakened,</b> the robber <b>says to him: That which is yours is before you,</b> and no further compensation is required. This is <b>because</b> despite <b>a change,</b> the changed item <b>remains in its place.</b> Since the robber has not acquired it, he simply returns the item to the robbery victim.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the robber has not acquired it, then <b>even if he enhanced it</b> that should be the <i>halakha</i> <b>as well.</b> The item should still belong to the robbery victim and the robber should not be entitled to compensation. The Sages <b>say</b> in response: The fact that the robber has a right to demand compensation for the enhancement is <b>due to an ordinance</b> instituted <b>for the penitent.</b> In order to ease the burden of one who desires to repent, the Sages instituted that the robber be reimbursed for the increase in the value of the animal. Otherwise, a robber might refrain from returning a stolen item.
The Gemara continues: <b>What is</b> the source that indicates that <b>Rabbi Yishmael</b> holds that an item that undergoes a change is still considered to have the same status that it had before the change? The Gemara answers: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The ideal way to fulfill the <b>mitzva of produce in the corner of the field, which is given to the poor [<i>pe’a</i>],</b> is <b>to separate</b> it <b>from the standing</b> grain, i.e., grain that has not been harvested. If <b>one did not separate</b> it <b>from the standing</b> grain, he <b>separates</b> it <b>from the sheaves</b> of grain that have already been harvested. If he <b>did not separate</b> it <b>from the sheaves,</b> he <b>separates</b> it <b>from the pile</b> of grain, <b>as long as</b> he <b>has not</b> yet <b>smoothed</b> the pile.
If he <b>smoothed</b> the pile of grain, activating the obligation to tithe the produce, he first <b>tithes</b> the grain <b>and</b> then <b>gives</b> a portion of the tithed produce <b>to</b> the poor as <i>pe’a</i>, so that the poor will not have to tithe what they receive. Additionally, <b>they said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael:</b> If he did not separate <i>pe’a</i> during any of the aforementioned stages and he made a dough from the grain, <b>he separates</b> <i>pe’a</i> <b>even from the dough and gives it to</b> the poor. This indicates that even if the grain was changed, one is not exempt from the obligation of <i>pe’a</i>.
The Gemara has now clarified the sources Abaye alluded to when he listed all the <i>tanna’im</i> who hold that despite a change, the changed item remains in its place. <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Did all these <i>tanna’im</i> go to</b> so much trouble in <b>an effort [<i>ikhpal</i>] to teach us</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai,</b> which is presumably not accepted as normative? Abaye <b>said to</b> Rav Pappa: <b>This is what they are saying: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not engage in a dispute with regard to this matter.</b> All of the aforementioned <i>tanna’im</i> hold that even Beit Hillel agree that a change in the form of an item does not impact its status.
<b>Rava said: From where</b> can it be proven that all of the aforementioned <i>tanna’im</i> hold that an item that undergoes a change is still considered to have the same status that it had before the change? One can say that the reasons for their statements are due to other factors. <b>Perhaps Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda states</b> his opinion, that it is not a significant change, <b>there,</b> in the case of the first of the sheared wool, <b>only with regard to dye,</b> which is a reversible change, <b>since one is able to remove it with soap.</b>
<b>And</b> perhaps <b>Beit Shammai state</b> their opinion <b>there,</b> in the case of a harlot, <b>only</b> with regard to an offering <b>to the Most High, because</b> of the fact <b>that</b> the item <b>has become repugnant,</b> in being used as payment for the services of a prostitute, and therefore it cannot be used for an offering even if its form has changed.
<b>And</b> perhaps <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov states</b> his opinion <b>there,</b> where one robbed another of wheat, <b>only with regard to a blessing, because this is a mitzva</b> that <b>is performed through</b> commission of <b>a transgression,</b> but this does not indicate that a change is insignificant with regard to other matters.
<b>And</b> perhaps <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar states</b> his opinion <b>there,</b> where the condition of the animal changed, <b>only with regard to weakening</b> of the animal <b>that is reversible.</b> Since the animal’s value can be restored by fattening it, the weakening is not deemed a significant change.
<b>And</b> perhaps <b>Rabbi Yishmael states</b> his opinion <b>there,</b> where one separated <i>pe’a</i> at a late stage, <b>only with regard to <i>pe’a</i>, because it is written: “You shall leave</b> them for the poor” <b>an additional</b> time. It is mentioned twice, in Leviticus 19:10 and Leviticus 23:22. One of these terms is superfluous, indicating that <i>pe’a</i> must be given to the poor under all circumstances, even if the grain was changed and made into dough. <b>And if you would say: Let us derive from</b> <i>pe’a</i> that in other halakhic domains the status of an item is not affected by its undergoing a change, <i>pe’a</i> cannot function as a source because <b>gifts to the poor are different</b> from other <i>halakhot</i>.
The Gemara notes: Rava’s claim that no definitive conclusion with regard to the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael concerning a changed item is supported by the statement of another <i>amora</i> is <b>like the dilemma raised by Rabbi Yonatan, as Rabbi Yonatan raises a dilemma: What is the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yishmael?</b> Is it <b>because he holds</b> that <b>change does not</b> cause one to <b>acquire</b> an item? <b>Or perhaps he generally holds</b> that <b>change</b> does cause one to <b>acquire</b> an item, <b>but here,</b> in the case of <i>pe’a</i>, it is different <b>because</b> the term <b>“You shall leave” is written an additional</b> time.
Having quoted Rabbi Yonatan’s dilemma, the Gemara asks: <b>And if you say</b> that <b>the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yishmael is that he holds that change does not</b> cause one to <b>acquire</b> an item, <b>why do I</b> need the <b>additional</b> term <b>“You shall leave,” which the Merciful One writes</b> in the Torah? <b>And furthermore, according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that <i>pe’a</i> may not be taken from dough, <b>why do I</b> need <b>the additional</b> term <b>“You shall leave” that the Merciful One writes?</b>
The Gemara responds: This additional term <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who renounced ownership of his vineyard and arose early in the morning</b> before anyone else took possession of it <b>and harvested it is obligated in</b> the mitzva of <b>individual fallen</b> grapes left for the poor <b>[<i>peret</i>], and in</b> the mitzva of <b>incompletely formed clusters</b> of grapes left for the poor <b>[<i>olelot</i>], and in</b> the mitzva of <b>forgotten</b> clusters of grapes left for the poor <b>and in</b> the mitzva of <b><i>pe’a</i>.</b> These are the four gifts to the poor that the Torah requires one to give from a vineyard. <b>But he is exempt from the</b> mitzva to <b>tithe</b> his produce, because this requirement does not apply to an ownerless field. The obligation to give gifts to the poor in this case is derived from the additional mention of the term “You shall leave.”
§ The Gemara returns to the discussion of a stolen item that underwent a change. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> who says that even if the stolen animal deteriorated, it is returned to the owner in its current state.
The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>But did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say this? But doesn’t Shmuel say: One does not appraise</b> the change in value, <b>neither for a thief nor for a robber. Rather,</b> they keep the stolen animal and pay back the victim with their own money; one appraises the change only for one obligated to pay <b>for damage?</b>
<b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava, who said</b> earlier in response to Abaye: <b>When Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar states</b> his opinion <b>there,</b> he stated it only <b>with regard to weakening</b> of the animal <b>that is reversible,</b> this is <b>not difficult: When</b> Shmuel <b>says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> who holds <b>that</b> despite <b>a change,</b> the changed item <b>remains in its place,</b> he stated this <b>with regard to weakening</b> of the animal <b>which is reversible,</b> in which case the change is insignificant. <b>And when Shmuel says there: One does not appraise</b> the change in value, <b>neither for a thief nor for a robber,</b> but rather one appraises the change <b>only</b> for one obligated to pay <b>for damage,</b> he stated this <b>with regard to weakening</b> of the animal <b>that is irreversible.</b>
<b>But according to Abaye, who said</b> that <b>when Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar states</b> his opinion, <b>he states it</b> even <b>with regard to weakening</b> of the animal <b>which is irreversible, what can be said?</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>Abaye taught</b> the statement of Shmuel <b>like this: Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b>

Daf 94b

Some <b>said</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar, but</b> Shmuel <b>himself does not hold accordingly.</b>
The Gemara continues the discussion of acquisition of a stolen item due to a change it underwent. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: By Torah law, a stolen item that has changed is returned as is, as it is stated: “And he shall restore that which he took by robbery”</b> (Leviticus 5:23). This indicates that he shall return it <b>in any case,</b> even if it has been changed. <b>And if you say:</b> In <b>our mishna</b> it is stated that if the stolen item is changed the robber gives monetary compensation rather than returning the item, that policy was instituted by the Sages <b>due to the ordinance</b> instituted <b>for the penitent.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say that? But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with an unattributed mishna, and we learned</b> in a mishna with regard to first of the sheared wool (<i>Ḥullin</i> 135a): If the owner of the sheep <b>did not manage to give</b> the sheared wool <b>to</b> the priest <b>before he dyed it,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from giving it to the priest. This indicates that dyeing the wool is a significant change.
<b>One of the Rabbis, whose name</b> was <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, said to them: It was explained to me</b> directly <b>by Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that he was referring to a case <b>where he robbed</b> another of <b>sanded wood and fashioned it into vessels, which is a change</b> in which the item <b>can revert to its original state.</b> Consequently, the robber does not acquire the item by Torah law, but rather due to the ordinance instituted for the penitent.
§ Having mentioned the ordinance instituted for the penitent, the Gemara discusses other details of this ordinance. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Shevi’it</i> 8:11): With regard to <b>robbers or usurers that returned</b> either the stolen item or the interest to the one from whom they took it, <b>one</b> should <b>not accept</b> it <b>from them. And</b> with regard to <b>one who does accept</b> it <b>from them, the Sages are displeased with him,</b> since by doing so he discourages those who wish to repent.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This mishna,</b> i.e., the statement of the <i>Tosefta</i>, <b>was taught in the days of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident with regard to one man who desired to repent</b> after having been a thief for many years. <b>His wife said to him: Empty one [<i>reika</i>], if you repent</b> you will have to return all the stolen items to their rightful owners, and <b>even</b> the <b>belt</b> that you are wearing <b>is not yours, and he refrained and did not repent. At that time,</b> the Sages <b>said:</b> With regard to <b>robbers or usurers that returned</b> either the stolen item or the interest to the one from whom they took it, <b>one</b> should <b>not accept</b> it <b>from them. And</b> concerning <b>one who does accept</b> it <b>from them, the Sages are displeased with him.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to children whose deceased <b>father left them money</b> paid <b>as interest, although they know that it is interest, they are not obligated to return</b> it. The Gemara infers: <b>They,</b> the children, <b>are</b> the ones <b>that are not</b> obligated to return it, <b>but their father</b> would have been <b>obligated to return</b> it, and his victims may accept his money.
The Gemara responds: <b>By right,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should have taught <b>that their father also</b> would <b>not</b> have been <b>obligated to return</b> it. <b>And</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to</b> the children is <b>because</b> of the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>wants to teach</b> a <i>halakha</i> in <b>the latter clause:</b> If <b>their</b> deceased <b>father left them a cow, or a garment, or any</b> other <b>specific item</b> he had stolen or taken as interest, <b>they are obligated to return</b> it <b>due to the honor of their father,</b> so that the item not serve as a reminder to all that their father transgressed. Since this <i>halakha</i> needs to be stated specifically with regard to the children, <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also taught with regard to them.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> is it true that <b>due to the honor of their father they are obligated to return</b> the item or money? <b>I will read here</b> the verse: “You shall not revile God, <b>nor curse a ruler of your people”</b> (Exodus 22:27), from which the Sages inferred that the prohibition against cursing a ruler is in effect only <b>with regard to</b> a ruler that <b>acts as</b> a member of <b>your people,</b> i.e., in accordance with Torah law. One who curses a wicked ruler does not violate this prohibition. Similarly, if one’s father is wicked, the mitzva to honor him should not apply. Why would his children have to return items that he stole due to his honor?
The Gemara responds: It is <b>like that</b> which <b>Rav Pineḥas said</b> concerning a different case: This is a case <b>where he repented. Here too,</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the father <b>repented,</b> and since he is no longer wicked, his children are obligated to honor him. The Gemara asks: <b>If he repented, what was</b> the stolen item or interest <b>doing with him? He should have returned it</b> while he was still alive. The Gemara responds: It is a case <b>where he did not manage to return it before he died.</b> Consequently, the children must return the items in order to uphold their father’s honor.
The Gemara raises another contradiction: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the statement of another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>robbers and usurers, although they collected</b> the stolen item or interest, <b>they return</b> it.
The Gemara first clarifies the meaning of the <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>robbers, what collection is there,</b> i.e., why did the <i>baraita</i> use the term: Collected, in this context? <b>If they robbed, they robbed</b> and did not collect anything; <b>and if they did not rob, they did not rob</b> and cannot be called robbers at all. <b>Rather,</b> emend the text of the <i>baraita</i> to <b>say:</b> With regard to <b>robbers, and who are they,</b> i.e., what is meant by the term: Robbers? It is referring to <b>usurers.</b> The Gemara resumes its citation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Although they collected</b> the interest, <b>they must return</b> it. This is contrary to the ruling of the <i>Tosefta</i> that if robbers and usurers return what they have taken, it is not accepted. The Gemara explains: <b>Say</b> that this <i>baraita</i> means that <b>they return</b> it, <b>but one does not accept</b> it <b>from them.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But why do they return</b> it if it will not be accepted? The Gemara responds: In order <b>to fulfill</b> their obligation to <b>Heaven.</b> In order to fully repent, they must at least offer to return to the debtors the interest they took unlawfully.
The Gemara raises a contradiction from another source. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the statement of another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>shepherds</b> who allow their animals to graze in other people’s fields, thereby stealing from the owners; <b>or</b> tax <b>collectors</b> who are hired to collect taxes on behalf of the government and collect excessive sums; <b>or tax collectors</b> who purchase the right to collect taxes themselves and collect unlawfully, <b>their repentance is difficult,</b> since they steal from the public. It is difficult for them to find every one of their victims in order to pay them restitution, <b>and they</b> must <b>return</b> what they have stolen <b>to whomever they recognize</b> as victims of their theft. This <i>baraita</i> indicates that thieves do return what they have stolen.
The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that <b>they return</b> it, <b>but one does not accept</b> it <b>from them.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But why do they return</b> it if it will not be accepted? The Gemara responds: In order <b>to fulfill</b> their obligation to <b>Heaven.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if they are not actually obligated to return what they have stolen, <b>why is their repentance difficult?</b>
<b>And furthermore, say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> as for the money belonging to those <b>that they do not recognize</b> as their victims, <b>they should use</b> that money for <b>community needs. And Rav Ḥisda says:</b> This means providing <b>pits, ditches, and caves,</b> which benefit the general public. This indicates that a thief actually does pay back what he has stolen. <b>Rather,</b> this contradiction must be resolved differently. It is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> states that he must actually return what he has stolen, it is referring to a time <b>before the ordinance</b> for the penitent was instituted. <b>There,</b> where the <i>baraita</i> states that one does not accept the repayment from a robber, it is referring to a time <b>after the ordinance</b> was instituted.
The Gemara adds: <b>And now that Rav Naḥman says</b> that when the Sages say that he does not return what he has stolen, they refer only to a case <b>where the stolen item does not exist</b> in its initial form, and <b>you</b> can <b>even say</b> that <b>this and that,</b> both <i>baraitot</i>, are referring to a time <b>after the ordinance</b> was instituted, <b>and</b> it is <b>not difficult.</b>

Daf 95a

<b>Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that rules that one may accept the stolen item is referring to a case <b>where the stolen item</b> still <b>exists. There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that rules not to accept it even if the robber seeks only to fulfill his obligation to Heaven is referring to a case where the <b>stolen item does not</b> still <b>exist.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the incident in which the robber’s wife told him that he would have to return even the <b>belt,</b> which was the impetus for instituting the ordinance for the penitents, was a case <b>where</b> the <b>stolen item</b> still <b>exists,</b> in which case the robber would be obligated to return it even after the ordinance was instituted. The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is meant by: Even the <b>belt?</b> The <b>value of the belt,</b> but the actual belt was no longer in his possession.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>the Sages did not institute an ordinance</b> for the penitent <b>anywhere that</b> the <b>stolen item</b> still <b>exists? But there is</b> the case of <b>a beam, which is a stolen item that</b> still <b>exists, and we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 55a): <b>With regard to a stolen beam that</b> the robber <b>built into a building,</b> the Sages instituted <b>that</b> the robbery victim <b>should take its monetary</b> value and not the actual beam <b>because of the ordinance</b> instituted for <b>the penitent,</b> i.e., so that the penitent not be required to destroy his house. This indicates that the ordinance instituted for the penitent is in effect even when the stolen item still exists. The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different. Since</b> in that case <b>there is the loss of the</b> entire <b>building, the Sages treat</b> the beam <b>as though it were not</b> in existence.
§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>a pregnant cow, and it</b> then <b>gave birth</b> while in the robber’s possession, or if one robbed another of a ewe that was laden with wool and the robber then sheared it, he pays the owner the value of a cow that is ready to give birth, or the value of a ewe that is ready to be shorn. In connection with this, <b>the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who robs</b> another of <b>a ewe and sheared it,</b> and similarly, one who robs another of <b>a cow and it gave birth,</b> must <b>pay it and its sheared</b> wool <b>or</b> it and <b>its offspring;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: A stolen item is returned as is. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> A stolen item <b>is viewed as though it had been monetarily appraised</b> at the time of the robbery, and the robber pays only that amount.
The Gemara clarifies the different opinions in this <i>baraita</i>. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is the reasoning of Rabbi Meir,</b> who holds that the robber returns the animal and its sheared wool or the animal and its offspring? Is it <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he holds</b> that despite <b>a change,</b> the changed item <b>remains in its place?</b> Despite its changes, the animal always remained in the possession of the robbery victims, and consequently any increase in value belongs to them. <b>Or, perhaps</b> Rabbi Meir <b>generally</b> holds that one <b>acquires</b> an item due to <b>a change</b> in it, and therefore the wool or offspring should belong to the robber by right, <b>but here it is a penalty that he imposes,</b> which forces the robber to return items that are technically his.
The Gemara explains: <b>In what</b> case does the reasoning of Rabbi Meir make a practical <b>difference? In</b> a case <b>where</b> the stolen item was <b>devalued</b> since the time of the robbery. If Rabbi Meir’s reason is that despite a change, the changed item remains in its place, it is returned as is, even if its current value is less than what its value had been at the time of the robbery. But if he requires the robber to return the item itself because of a penalty, and by right the robber acquired the animal due to the change, then in this case, where the value decreased, the robber would be required to return what its value had been at the time of the robbery.
The Gemara attempts to find a solution to this question: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in the mishna (96b): If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>an animal and it aged</b> while in his possession, consequently diminishing its value, or if one robbed another of <b>slaves and they aged, he pays according to</b> the value of the stolen item at <b>the time of the robbery. Rabbi Meir says: With regard to slaves,</b> the robber <b>says to</b> the owner: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> this indicates that with regard to <b>an animal</b> that aged while in the possession of the robber Rabbi Meir concedes to the first <i>tanna</i>, and he too holds that <b>he pays according to</b> what its value had been at <b>the time of the robbery.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that despite <b>a change,</b> the changed item <b>remains in its place,</b> then the <b>animal</b> should be returned as it is in the case of the animal that aged, <b>as well. Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the mishna that <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that one <b>acquires</b> an item due to <b>a change</b> in the item, <b>but here,</b> in the case of a stolen animal that subsequently was shorn or gave birth, the payment of wool or offspring <b>is a penalty</b> with <b>which he penalizes</b> the robber, so that the robber will not benefit from the increased value of the stolen item?
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: Rabbi Meir’s reasoning cannot be proven from the mishna, since it is possible to say that <b>Rabbi Meir is speaking to</b> the Rabbis <b>in accordance with the Rabbis’</b> own <b>statement.</b> His statement should be understood as follows: <b>According to my own</b> opinion, one <b>does not acquire</b> an item due to <b>a change</b> in the item, <b>and an animal</b> that was stolen and then aged should be returned as it is now, <b>as well. But according to you, who say</b> that one <b>acquires</b> an item due to <b>a change</b> in it, <b>agree with me in any event</b> that <b>with regard to a slave,</b> he is returned as is. This is <b>because his legal status is like</b> that of <b>real estate, and real estate cannot be stolen. And the Rabbis say to him</b> in response: <b>No,</b> for the purpose of robbery, <b>the legal status of a slave is like</b> that of <b>movable property.</b>
The Gemara again attempts to find a solution to the question: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in the mishna (100b): If one gave wool to a dyer <b>to dye it red for him and he dyed it black,</b> or to dye it <b>black and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The dyer <b>gives</b> the owner of the wool the <b>value of his wool,</b> since the dyer violated the owner’s wishes. It can be inferred from this mishna: The <b>value of his wool, yes,</b> he must give it; but the <b>value of his wool and its enhancement,</b> i.e., the amount by which the value of the wool increased because it was dyed, <b>no,</b> he need not give it. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that one <b>does not acquire</b> an item due to <b>a change</b> in the item, the dyer should be <b>required to return</b> the <b>value of his wool and its enhancement to</b> the owner, as it never left the owner’s possession.
<b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that <b>Rabbi Meir holds that</b> one <b>acquires</b> an item due to <b>a change</b> in the item, <b>but here,</b> in the case of a stolen animal that was subsequently shorn or gave birth, the payment of wool or offspring <b>is a penalty</b> with <b>which he penalizes</b> the robber, so that the robber will not benefit from the increased value of the stolen item? The Gemara affirms this: <b>Learn from</b> the mishna that this is indeed the reasoning of Rabbi Meir.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say: This,</b> i.e., Rabbi Meir’s reasoning, <b>was never in question for us.</b> Why not? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that Rav reversed</b> the opinions in the mishna on 96b <b>and taught</b> it as follows: If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>an animal and it aged,</b> or if one robbed another of <b>slaves and they aged, he pays according to</b> what their value had been at <b>the time of the robbery;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: With regard to slaves,</b> the robber <b>says to</b> the owner: <b>That which is yours is before you. Certainly,</b> then, <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> one <b>acquires</b> an item due to <b>a change</b> in the item, which is why the robber pays according to what its value had been at the time of the robbery. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the cow that gave birth or the ewe that was shorn, the payment of offspring or wool <b>is a penalty</b> with <b>which he penalizes</b> the robber.
The Gemara continues the alternative explanation. <b>When we asked</b> the question, <b>this is how we asked</b> it: <b>When</b> Rabbi Meir <b>penalizes</b> the robber, is it only for one who robbed <b>intentionally, but</b> if one took an item from its owner <b>unintentionally,</b> Rabbi Meir <b>does not penalize</b> the robber? <b>Or perhaps he penalizes even</b> one who took an item from its owner <b>unintentionally.</b>
The Gemara tries to resolve this question: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Five</b> types of monetary claims <b>are collected</b> only <b>from unsold [<i>meḥorarin</i>]</b> property, i.e., property that is still in possession of its owner and has not been sold in the meantime.
<b>And these are they: Produce, and</b> the <b>enhanced</b> value of <b>produce.</b> Even if one has the right to the produce of a particular property, or the gain accrued from that produce, he cannot claim this payment from liened property. The Gemara continues with the list of monetary claims collected from unsold property: <b>And one who accepts upon himself</b> at the time of his betrothal the obligation <b>to provide sustenance for his wife’s son or his wife’s daughter</b> from a previous marriage; <b>and a promissory note that has no</b> property <b>guarantee,</b> i.e., a document that does not explicitly state that all of the properties of the debtor will serve to guarantee payment of the debt; <b>and</b> similarly, <b>a woman’s marriage contract that has no</b> property <b>guarantee.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Whom did you hear that says</b> that omission of the <b>guarantee</b> of the sale from the document <b>is not a scribal error?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> There is a dispute between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis with regard to a promissory note that does not contain a property guarantee. According to the Rabbis, it was omitted in error and is always considered as having been written in the document. Rabbi Meir holds that a promissory note that does not contain a property guarantee cannot be used to collect property that has been liened or sold; it can be used to collect only unsold property. This <i>baraita</i> is therefore in accordance with Rabbi Meir’s opinion. <b>And</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>produce and</b> the <b>enhanced</b> value of <b>produce</b> are collected only from unsold property.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which he collects the <b>enhanced</b> value of <b>produce?</b> It is a case <b>where</b> one <b>robbed another</b> of <b>a field, and</b> then <b>sold it to another, and</b> the purchaser <b>enhanced it, and it is now leaving the possession</b> of the purchaser because the robbery victim has proved in court that this field is his. <b>When</b> the purchaser <b>collects</b> from the robber who sold him this field, in order to recoup what he had paid,

Daf 95b

he can <b>collect the principal,</b> i.e., what he paid for the field, <b>from</b> the robber’s <b>liened property</b> that has been sold. <b>But</b> he can collect <b>the enhanced</b> value, i.e., the value of the improvements made to the field, only <b>from unsold property.</b> Why are both of these collected from the robber? <b>Because the owner of the field came and took</b> both <b>his land and its enhanced</b> value.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What, is it not</b> speaking <b>of</b> a purchaser who is <b>an ignoramus, who does not know whether property can be stolen or cannot be stolen,</b> and when he purchased stolen land from the robber, he did so unintentionally, since he was under the mistaken impression that this land belonged to the robber who sold it? <b>And even so, the owner of the land can come and take the land and its enhanced</b> value. <b>And</b> if so, one may <b>learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that Rabbi Meir <b>penalizes even</b> one who acquires stolen items <b>unintentionally.</b> The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>No,</b> it is speaking <b>of a purchaser</b> who is <b>a Torah scholar, and he knew</b> that the robber had no right to sell this land. The purchaser is therefore penalized and is required to return the enhanced value of the land as well.
The Gemara again tries to determine the scope of the penalty: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a mishna (100b): If one gave wool to a dyer <b>to dye it red for him and he dyed it black,</b> or to dye it <b>black and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The dyer <b>gives</b> the owner of the wool the <b>value of his wool,</b> since the dyer violated the owner’s instructions. It can be inferred from the mishna: The <b>value of his wool, yes,</b> he must give; <b>but</b> the <b>value of his wool and its enhanced</b> value, i.e., the amount by which the value of the wool increased because it was dyed, <b>no,</b> he is not required to give.
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that Rabbi Meir <b>penalizes</b> one who acquires a stolen item <b>unintentionally as well,</b> the dyer should be <b>required to return</b> the <b>value of his wool and its enhancement to him. Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the mishna that if it was done <b>intentionally,</b> Rabbi Meir <b>penalizes</b> the robber, but if it was done <b>unintentionally he does not penalize</b> him? The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from</b> the mishna that this indeed is the reasoning of Rabbi Meir.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A stolen item is returned as is. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The stolen item <b>is viewed as though it had been monetarily appraised</b> at the time of the robbery. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between them,</b> since ostensibly they agree that the robber does not return the value of the enhancement to the robbery victim?
<b>Rav Zevid says: They disagree with regard to enhancement that is</b> still <b>upon the stolen item.</b> The disagreement concerns a case where the enhancement occurred while the stolen item was in the possession of the robber, and when he returned the item it was still enhanced. Therefore, he did not keep any of the enhancement. <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the enhancement <b>belongs to the one who was robbed, and Rabbi Shimon holds that it belongs to the robber.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said</b> that the disagreement between Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon can be explained differently: <b>Everyone</b> agrees that the <b>enhancement that is</b> still <b>upon the stolen item belongs to the robber, and here they disagree</b> with regard to whether the robber can keep <b>one-half,</b> or <b>one-third, or one-fourth</b> of the value of the enhancement, and the remainder is kept by the owner of the animal. <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that the <b>enhancement that is</b> still <b>upon the stolen item belongs entirely to the robber, and Rabbi Shimon holds</b> that <b>the robber takes one-half,</b> or <b>one-third, or one-fourth</b> of the value of the enhancement. In other words, he is treated as a shepherd or rancher and receives the share of the enhancement that local custom dictates be paid to that type of laborer.
The Gemara cites a proof for Rav Zevid’s explanation: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna (93b): If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>a cow, and it became pregnant in his</b> possession, <b>and it</b> then <b>gave birth;</b> or if one robbed another of <b>a ewe, and it became laden</b> with wool <b>in his</b> possession, <b>and he</b> then <b>sheared it,</b> the robber <b>pays according to</b> the value of the animal at <b>the time of the robbery.</b> The Gemara infers from the mishna: If the cow <b>gave birth, yes,</b> he pays the value of the animal at the time of the theft, but if the cow <b>did not give birth</b> and is still pregnant, it is <b>returned as is.</b>
<b>Granted, according to</b> the explanation of <b>Rav Zevid, who says</b> that <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, enhancement that is</b> still <b>upon the stolen item belongs to the one who was robbed,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> as the pregnant cow is returned as is. <b>But according to</b> the explanation of <b>Rav Pappa, who says</b> that everyone agrees that the enhancement <b>belongs to the robber,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? It is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, nor</b> is it in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> as the robber does not retain any of the enhanced value.
The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Pappa</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that the inference is incorrect: <b>The same is true</b> that <b>even if it did not give birth,</b> the robber <b>pays according to</b> the value of the animal at <b>the time of the robbery,</b> and the enhanced value due to the pregnancy is returned to him. <b>And that which the mishna teaches: It</b> then <b>gave birth,</b> cannot serve as the basis for an inference pertaining to this discussion. <b>As</b> the <i>tanna</i> needs to <b>cite</b> that <b>it gave birth</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, since in that case he acquires the animal due to the change in its condition, therefore <b>he cites</b> that <b>it gave birth</b> in <b>the latter clause as well,</b> but it need not have given birth. It cannot be inferred from this mishna that an animal that has not given birth is returned as is.
The Gemara notes: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the explanation <b>of Rav Pappa.</b> The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> The stolen item <b>is viewed as though it had been monetarily appraised</b> at the time of the theft, <b>for</b> the purpose of keeping <b>one-half,</b> or <b>one-third, or one-fourth</b> of the value of the enhancement.
<b>Rav Ashi said: When we were</b> studying <b>in the study hall of Rav Kahana, we were asked</b> a question: <b>According</b> to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says that the robber takes one-half,</b> or <b>one-third, or one-fourth</b> of the value of the enhancement; <b>when we remove</b> the robber, taking the stolen animal from him and paying him a portion of the enhanced value, do <b>we remove him</b> by paying him his share <b>with money? Or, perhaps he takes</b> his portion <b>from the meat</b> of the animal.
<b>And we resolved the</b> dilemma <b>from that which Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> In <b>three</b> cases, the court <b>appraises the enhanced</b> value <b>for</b> the parties involved in enhancing a field, <b>and they are paid in money</b> rather than by being given a portion of the property, <b>and these are they: A firstborn</b> son who makes payment <b>to a regular</b> son. This is a case where two sons, one firstborn and the other not, inherit a field from their father. Before it is divided, they both work and enhance the field. When the time comes to divide the field, the firstborn son, who receives a double portion, must pay his brother for the enhancement that the latter contributed to the former’s portion. This payment is given in money rather than land.
<b>And</b> the second case is that of <b>a creditor</b> who is obligated <b>to a purchaser,</b> i.e., a creditor who collects the debt from lands that were sold by the debtor. He pays money to the purchaser for the enhancements generated by the purchaser but does not pay him in land. <b>And</b> the third case is that of <b>a creditor</b> who is obligated <b>to orphans,</b> i.e., a creditor who collects land from the orphans of his debtor. He must pay them for any enhancements done by the orphans after their father’s death. This payment is also given in money rather than land.
The Gemara discusses Shmuel’s statement. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say</b> that <b>a creditor gives the purchaser</b> any of the <b>enhanced</b> value at all? <b>But doesn’t Shmuel say: A creditor collects</b> all of <b>the enhanced</b> value? Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> where Shmuel stated that a creditor does not collect the enhanced value, it was <b>with regard to</b> a case where there was <b>enhancement that reaches shoulders [<i>shevaḥ hammaggia likhtefayim</i>],</b> i.e., the produce that grew due to the improvements made by the purchaser is fully grown and ripened and can now be harvested and carried upon one’s shoulders. <b>But there,</b> where Shmuel stated that a creditor does collect the enhanced value, it was <b>with regard to</b> a case where there was <b>enhancement that does not reach shoulders,</b> i.e., its growth is not complete.
Ravina <b>said to him: But</b> there were <b>daily incidents</b> of this type, <b>and Shmuel would collect</b> from purchasers <b>even enhancement that reached shoulders.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: This</b> is <b>not difficult.</b>

Daf 96a

<b>This</b> ruling, that Shmuel would collect the enhanced value, is for a case <b>where</b> the creditor <b>is owed by</b> the debtor <b>the amount of</b> the value of <b>the land and the enhanced value. That</b> ruling, that Shmuel would not collect the value of the enhancement, is for a case where the creditor <b>is owed by</b> the debtor <b>only the amount of</b> the value of <b>the land.</b>
Ravina <b>said to him: This works out well according to the one who says: If the purchaser</b> of the field <b>has money, he</b> still <b>cannot remove the creditor</b> from the land, i.e., the creditor has the right to collect the land. This is <b>well. But according to the one who says: If the purchaser</b> of the field <b>has money, he can remove the creditor</b> from the land, i.e., the purchaser can choose to pay him money instead, <b>let</b> the purchaser <b>say: If I had money, I would remove you from all of the land; now</b> that I do not have sufficient money to pay what you are owed, <b>give me</b> at least <b>a <i>se’a</i> [<i>griva</i>] of land,</b> which is <b>the amount of my enhancement.</b>
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the debtor <b>set aside</b> this field as <b>designated repayment for him, as he said to him: You shall not be repaid from anything but this,</b> in which case he clearly has a lien on this field and nothing else.
§ The Gemara continues the discussion of a stolen item that has been enhanced. <b>Rava says:</b> If one <b>robbed</b> another of an item <b>and enhanced</b> it <b>and sold</b> it to another, <b>and</b> similarly, if one <b>robbed</b> another of an item <b>and enhanced</b> it and then died <b>and bequeathed</b> it, <b>he sold that which he enhanced and bequeathed that which he enhanced.</b> And the robbery victim, should he wish to recover the stolen item, must pay the purchaser or heir for the enhanced value.
<b>Rava raises a dilemma</b> related to the aforementioned <i>halakha</i>: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>a purchaser enhanced</b> the stolen item? Must the robbery victim pay the purchaser for the enhanced value or not? <b>After</b> Rava <b>raised the dilemma, he then resolved it: What has the first</b> person <b>sold to the second</b> in any sale? He has sold <b>any rights that will come into his possession.</b> Since the robber had the rights to the value of his enhancements to the stolen item, he sold those rights to the purchaser as well.
<b>Rava raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>a gentile</b> robber <b>enhanced</b> the value of a stolen item? <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: Shall we arise and institute an ordinance for</b> the benefit of <b>a gentile?</b> Ravina <b>said to him:</b> This question <b>is not necessary</b> except <b>where</b> it was the case <b>that</b> a gentile <b>sold it to a Jew.</b> Rava was asking if the Jew needs to return the enhanced value. The Gemara comments: <b>Ultimately, one who comes</b> to possess an item <b>due to</b> purchasing it from <b>a gentile is like a gentile</b> himself because, as stated previously, in any sale the purchaser’s rights are identical to the seller’s. Since the Sages did not institute ordinances for the benefit of gentiles, the Jewish purchaser does not have those rights either.
The Gemara explains: This question <b>is not necessary</b> except <b>where</b> it was the case <b>that a Jew robbed</b> another of the item <b>and sold it to</b> a gentile, <b>and the gentile enhanced it, and</b> then the <b>gentile went back and sold it to</b> another <b>Jew. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case? <b>Do we say: Since it was initially</b> stolen by <b>a Jew and</b> was <b>then</b> acquired by <b>a Jew, the Sages did institute an ordinance? Or, perhaps since there is</b> the ownership of <b>a gentile intervening, the Sages did not institute an ordinance.</b> The Gemara comments: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches that if one robbed another of wood and fashioned it into vessels, he acquired the wood due to the change. The Gemara discusses what qualifies as a change. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> With regard to <b>this one who robbed another of a palm tree and cut it</b> down, <b>although he threw it from the land</b> of the robbery victim <b>to his own land,</b> he <b>did not acquire</b> it. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The tree was <b>initially called a palm tree, and now,</b> although it has been cut down, <b>it is also called a palm tree,</b> so the change to the item is not sufficiently significant for the robber to acquire it. Moreover, if one robbed another of <b>a palm tree and made</b> it into <b>logs, he did not acquire it,</b> since <b>now, in any event, they are called palm tree logs.</b>
By contrast, if one robbed another of <b>logs and fashioned them</b> into <b>beams, he has acquired</b> them, since this change is significant. If one robbed another of <b>large beams and fashioned them</b> into <b>small beams, he did not acquire them,</b> since they are still called beams. If he <b>fashioned them</b> into <b>boards, he did acquire</b> them.
<b>Rava said: This one who robbed</b> another of <b>a palm frond and fashioned it</b> into <b>leaves [<i>hutzei</i>],</b> i.e., he removed the leaves from the spine, <b>has acquired</b> it, <b>since initially it was called a palm frond and now</b> it is called <b>leaves.</b> One who robbed another of <b>leaves and fashioned them</b> into <b>a broom has acquired them,</b> since <b>initially</b> they were called <b>leaves, and now</b> they are called <b>a broom.</b> One who robbed another of <b>a broom</b> and <b>fashioned it</b> into <b>a rope has not acquired it. What is the reason</b> for this? The reason is <b>that</b> he can <b>go back</b> and <b>unravel it, and it will</b> once again <b>be a broom.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>the</b> central <b>twin-leaf became split,</b> i.e., is this considered a change through which a stolen <i>lulav</i> would be acquired? The Gemara cites a proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that</b> which <b>Rabbi Matun says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> If <b>the</b> central <b>twin-leaf was removed,</b> the <i>lulav</i> <b>is unfit.</b>

Daf 96b

<b>What, is it not</b> that <b>the same is true for</b> a case where the central twin-leaf <b>became split,</b> i.e., that this <i>lulav</i> has been rendered unfit to be used for the mitzva, and the robber has acquired the <i>lulav</i> as a result of this change? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the case where it <b>was removed is different, as</b> the result is that <b>it is lacking,</b> and an incomplete <i>lulav</i> is certainly unfit. But if the leaf remains in place, albeit split, it does not necessarily render the <i>lulav</i> unfit. The <i>lulav</i> has not been changed and therefore the robber does not acquire it.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the question was resolved as follows: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear that</b> which <b>Rabbi Matun says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> If <b>the</b> central <b>twin-leaf became split, it becomes like</b> a <i>lulav</i> whose central <b>twin-leaf was</b> completely <b>removed, and</b> it is <b>unfit.</b> If so, <b>learn from</b> his statement that if the central twin-leaf became split, the robber has acquired the <i>lulav</i> as a result of the change.
§ <b>Rav Pappa said: This one who robbed another</b> of <b>earth and fashioned it</b> into <b>a brick has not acquired</b> it due to the change. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>that he</b> can <b>return</b> it <b>and convert it</b> back into <b>earth.</b> By contrast, if he robbed another of <b>a brick, and</b> by crushing it <b>turned it</b> into <b>earth, he has acquired it</b> due to the change. <b>If you say: Perhaps</b> he will <b>return</b> it <b>and fashion it</b> into <b>a brick? This is a different brick, and a new entity has arrived,</b> i.e., entered into existence, <b>here.</b>
<b>And Rav Pappa</b> also <b>said: This one who robbed another</b> of <b>a bar of silver [<i>naskha</i>] and fashioned</b> it into <b>coins has not acquired it</b> due to the change. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? He can <b>return</b> it and by melting the coins <b>turn them</b> into <b>a bar of silver.</b> By contrast, if he robbed another of <b>coins and fashioned them</b> into <b>a bar of silver, he has acquired them</b> due to the change. <b>What do you say</b> in response to this, that perhaps he will <b>return and fashion them</b> into <b>coins?</b> These are new coins, and <b>a new entity has arrived here.</b>
Rav Pappa continues: If the stolen coins were <b>black [<i>sheḥimei</i>],</b> i.e., old and used, <b>and he made them</b> as <b>new</b> by cleaning them thoroughly, <b>he has not acquired</b> them. By contrast, if however, they were <b>new, and he made them black, he has acquired</b> them. <b>What do you say</b> in response to this, that perhaps he will <b>return</b> and <b>make them new</b> by cleaning them? <b>Their blackness is already known,</b> and therefore the coins have been changed irreversibly.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>This is the principle: All robbers pay according to</b> the value of the stolen item at <b>the time of the robbery.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is added</b> by the phrase: <b>This is the principle?</b> The Gemara replies: It serves <b>to add that which Rabbi Ela says:</b> If one <b>stole a lamb and</b> during the time that it was in the thief’s possession it <b>became a ram,</b> or if one stole <b>a calf and</b> it <b>became an ox,</b> then <b>a change occurred</b> while the animal was <b>in his possession, and he has acquired it</b> due to the change. If he then <b>slaughtered or sold</b> the animal, <b>he slaughters his own</b> animal <b>and he sells his own</b> animal, and he does not become liable to pay the penalty of four or five times the value of the animal.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who robbed another</b> of <b>a pair [<i>padna</i>] of oxen.</b> He then <b>went</b> and <b>plowed</b> his field <b>with them,</b> and <b>sowed seeds with them, and eventually returned them to their owner.</b> The robbery victim <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> to claim payment from the robber. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> the robbery victim and the robber: <b>Go estimate</b> the amount by <b>which</b> the value of the land <b>was enhanced</b> during the time that the pair of oxen was in the possession of the robber, and the robber must pay that amount.
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Naḥman: Did <b>the oxen</b> alone <b>enhance</b> the value of the land? <b>Did the land not</b> become <b>enhanced</b> in and of itself? Perhaps not all of the enhanced value of the land was due to the labor performed by the oxen. Rav Naḥman <b>said: Did I say</b> that <b>they should estimate</b> and give him <b>all of</b> the enhanced value? <b>I said</b> only <b>half.</b> Rava <b>said to him: Ultimately, it is a stolen item and is returned as it was</b> at the time of the robbery, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna: <b>All robbers pay according to</b> the value of the stolen item at <b>the time of the robbery.</b> Why should the robber also pay the owner half the value of the enhancement?
Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>Didn’t I tell you</b> that <b>when I am sitting in judgment, do not say anything to me,</b> i.e., do not question or comment upon my rulings. An indication that my rulings should not be questioned is <b>as our friend Huna has said about me,</b> that <b>King Shapur and I are brothers with regard to</b> monetary <b>laws,</b> i.e., with regard to monetary laws, my opinion is equal to that of Shmuel. <b>This man is an experienced robber, and I wish to penalize him.</b> Therefore, I compelled him to pay the enhanced value, although by right he is not obligated to do so.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>an animal and it aged</b> while in his possession, consequently diminishing its value, or if one robbed another of Canaanite <b>slaves and they aged</b> while in his possession, they have been changed. The robber therefore <b>pays according to</b> the value of the stolen item at <b>the time of the robbery. Rabbi Meir says: With regard to</b> Canaanite <b>slaves, he says to</b> the robbery victim: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b>
If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>a coin and it cracked,</b> thereby reducing its value; or if one robbed another of <b>produce and it rotted;</b> or if one robbed another of <b>wine and it fermented,</b> then <b>he pays according to</b> the value of the stolen item at <b>the time of the robbery.</b>
If he robbed another of <b>a coin and it was invalidated</b> by the government; or if he robbed another of <b><i>teruma</i> and it became ritually impure;</b> or if he robbed another of <b>leavened bread and Passover elapsed over it,</b> and therefore it is prohibited to derive benefit from it; or if he robbed another of <b>an animal and a sin was performed with it,</b> thereby disqualifying it for use as an offering; <b>or if</b> the animal <b>was disqualified from</b> being sacrificed <b>upon the altar</b> for some other reason; <b>or</b> if the animal <b>was going out to be stoned</b> because it gored and killed a person at some point after the robbery, the robber <b>says to</b> the robbery victim: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b> In all of these cases, although the value of the stolen item has been diminished or altogether lost, since the change is not externally discernible, the robber returns the item in its current state.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s statement that one who robbed another of an animal that aged pays what its value was at the time of the robbery, <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> It is <b>not</b> so that <b>aged</b> means that it <b>actually aged. But even</b> if the animal was <b>weakened,</b> which is a less significant change, it is still considered changed, and the robber has acquired the animal. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that it <b>aged,</b> indicating that a lesser change, e.g., weakening, is not significant? The Gemara responds: Rav Pappa was speaking of <b>weakening</b> that is <b>like aging,</b> i.e., the animal became so weak <b>that</b> it <b>will not return</b> to its former <b>health.</b>
<b>Mar Kashisha, son of Rav Ḥisda, said to Rav Ashi: This is what they say in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Even if one stole a lamb and</b> it <b>became a ram,</b> or <b>a calf and</b> it <b>became an ox,</b> it is considered that <b>a change occurred</b> while the animal was <b>in</b> the robber’s <b>possession, and he has acquired it</b> due to this change. If he then <b>slaughtered or sold</b> the animal, <b>he slaughters his own</b> animal <b>and he sells his own</b> animal, and he does not become liable to pay the penalty of four or five times the value of the animal. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Didn’t I say to you: Do not exchange</b> the names of the <b>men</b> in whose name you are transmitting words of Torah? <b>That</b> statement <b>was stated in the name of Rabbi Ela,</b> not in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Meir says: With regard to</b> Canaanite <b>slaves, he says to</b> the robbery victim: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Rav Ḥanina bar Avdimi says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> would <b>Rav set aside</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who are the majority, <b>and practice</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir?</b> The Sages <b>say:</b> It is <b>because it is taught</b> in <b>a <i>baraita</i></b> in the <b>opposite</b> manner, i.e., with the opinions reversed, so that the Rabbis, rather than Rabbi Meir, hold that with regard to slaves the robber says: That which is yours is before you. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> would <b>Rav set aside the mishna and practice</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>the <i>baraita</i>?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>Rav also teaches the mishna</b> in the <b>opposite</b> manner.
<b>And what is the reasoning of Rav, who reversed</b> the opinions in <b>the mishna in light of the <i>baraita</i>? On the contrary, let him reverse</b> the opinions in <b>the <i>baraita</i> in light of the mishna.</b> The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>Rav also learned the mishna</b> in the <b>opposite</b> manner. Rav did not decide to reverse the opinions in the mishna. In the text of the mishna that he utilized, the opinions were the same as in the <i>baraita</i>.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that Rav did in fact decide to reverse the opinions in the mishna, based upon the principle: <b>When he does not reverse</b> a mishna due to a <i>baraita</i>, it is when there is <b>one</b> mishna that he will not reverse <b>in light of one</b> <i>baraita</i>. But <b>he would reverse one</b> mishna <b>in light of two</b> <i>baraitot</i>, and in this case there is a second <i>baraita</i> in which the opinions are the reverse of those found in the mishna.
The second <i>baraita</i> is <b>as it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 8:23–24): In the case of <b>one who exchanges a cow for a donkey, and</b> in the meantime the cow <b>gave birth; and similarly,</b> in the case of <b>one who sells his</b> Canaanite <b>maidservant, and</b> in the meantime <b>she gave birth,</b> if in either of these cases the purchaser and seller have a dispute as to when the birth took place, where <b>this</b> one <b>says: She gave birth</b> at the time that she was <b>in my possession</b> and therefore the offspring is mine, <b>and the other is silent,</b> then the one who stated definitively that she gave birth while in his possession <b>has acquired</b> the offspring. If <b>this</b> one <b>says: I do not know, and that</b> one <b>says: I do not know,</b> then <b>they shall divide</b> the value of the offspring.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If <b>this</b> one <b>says:</b> She gave birth while <b>in my possession, and that</b> one <b>says:</b> She gave birth while <b>in my possession,</b> then <b>the seller must take an oath that she gave birth</b> while <b>in his possession, as anyone who</b> is obligated to <b>take an oath that is</b> enumerated <b>in the Torah takes an oath and does not pay;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> In this case, since the seller initially had possession of the animal or the maidservant, he is considered the defendant, and therefore it is sufficient for him to take an oath to exempt himself from payment and maintain possession of the offspring.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that <b>one does not take an oath concerning either</b> Canaanite <b>slaves or concerning land.</b> This indicates that according to the opinion of the Rabbis, Canaanite slaves have the legal status of land, whereas according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, they do not. It follows, then, that in the mishna here as well, it is the Rabbis, and not Rabbi Meir, who maintain that, with regard to slaves, one says: That which is yours is before you, as one does with regard to land.
The Gemara asks: If it is true that the opinion that the mishna attributed to Rabbi Meir was attributed by Rav to the Rabbis, then <b>this</b> phrase: The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> is imprecise. Rav <b>should have</b> said that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>This is</b> what Rav <b>is saying: According to</b> the way <b>that you have reversed</b> the opinions in the mishna, <b>and you taught</b> that Rabbi Meir says that the robber says to the robbery victim: That which is yours is before you, then the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> despite the fact that according to Rav, this is the opinion of the Rabbis.

Daf 97a

<b>And did Rav</b> actually <b>say</b> that the legal status of a Canaanite <b>slave is like</b> that of <b>real estate? But doesn’t Rav Daniel bar Rav Ketina say</b> that <b>Rav says: One who seizes another’s</b> Canaanite <b>slave and performs labor with him is exempt</b> from paying the master for the labor of the slave? <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that, in Rav’s opinion, the legal status of <b>a slave is like</b> that of <b>real estate, why</b> is he <b>exempt</b> from paying? A slave, like real estate, <b>is</b> always <b>in the possession of his owner,</b> wherever he might be. Therefore, the one who seized him did not steal the slave, in which case he could simply return him. Rather, he made use of a slave belonging to another and should be liable to pay for the master’s loss of the slave’s labor.
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case where the one who seized the slave forced him to perform labor when it was <b>not during</b> regular <b>working hours.</b> Consequently, he did not prevent the slave from performing labor for his master. Since the owner did not incur any loss, the one who seized the slave is not obligated to pay for the benefit that he derived from the slave. This is <b>like that</b> message <b>that Rabbi Abba sent to Mari bar Mar: Ask Rav Huna</b> concerning <b>one who resides in another’s courtyard without</b> the owner’s <b>knowledge: Does he need to pay him rent, or does he not need to pay him rent? And they sent to him</b> in response: <b>He does not need to pay him rent,</b> since the owner of the property did not incur any monetary loss.
The Gemara rejects this comparison: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? Granted, there,</b> in the case of a courtyard, <b>whether</b> the reasoning for that <i>halakha</i> is <b>according to the one who says: An inhabited house</b> remains <b>habitable,</b> and it is therefore <b>satisfactory for</b> the owner of the property to have someone residing in his courtyard, or <b>whether</b> the reasoning is <b>according to the one who says</b> that since the verse states: “In the city is left desolation, <b>and the gate is smitten unto ruin”</b> (Isaiah 24:12), which indicates that a desolate house will fall into ruin but an inhabited house will be maintained, either way it is satisfactory <b>for</b> the owner that one stay in his courtyard. Consequently, the one who resides there need not pay rent.
<b>But here,</b> in the case of a slave, <b>is it satisfactory for him that his slave be weakened</b> by performing labor for another? The Sages <b>say: Indeed, it is satisfactory for him that</b> the work habits of <b>his slave not be undone.</b>
The Gemara records a related incident. Members of the <b>house of Rav Yosef bar Ḥama would,</b> with his approval, <b>seize the slaves of people who owed him money, and they would work them</b> against the will of the owners. <b>Rabba, son of</b> Rav Yosef bar Ḥama, <b>said to him: What is the reason that</b> the <b>Master does this,</b> i.e., seizes and uses these slaves? Rav Yosef bar Ḥama <b>said to him: As Rav Naḥman says: A slave is not worth</b> even <b>the bread in his stomach.</b> When the slaves work for me and eat in my home, I am not causing the owners any monetary loss. Rav Yosef bar Ḥama’s son <b>said to him: I will say that Rav Naḥman said</b> this with regard to specific slaves, <b>such as his slave Daru, who</b> only <b>dances among</b> the wine <b>barrels [<i>kuvei</i>]</b> and does not perform any labor. <b>All</b> other <b>slaves perform labor,</b> and their labor is worth more than their board.
Rav Yosef bar Ḥama <b>said to him: I hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Daniel, as Rav Daniel bar Rav Ketina says</b> that <b>Rav says: One who seizes another’s slave and performs labor with him is exempt</b> from paying the master for the labor of the slave. <b>Apparently,</b> it is <b>satisfactory for</b> the master <b>that</b> the work habits of <b>his slave not be undone.</b>
Rabba <b>said to him: This statement</b> of Rav Daniel applies <b>when</b> the one who seizes the slave <b>is not owed money</b> by the owner of the slave. But <b>since the Master is owed money by</b> the owner of the slave, this <b>has</b> the <b>appearance of interest, as Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: Although</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>one who resides in another’s courtyard without his knowledge does not need to pay him rent,</b> if one <b>lent</b> money to another, <b>and</b> then <b>resided in the courtyard of another,</b> i.e., that of his creditor, <b>he needs to pay him rent,</b> to avoid the appearance of interest. Rav Yosef <b>bar Ḥama said to him: I retract</b> my opinion, and will no longer seize the slaves of my debtors.
It <b>was stated:</b> In the case of <b>one who seizes another’s ship and performs labor with it,</b> what payment can the ship’s owner claim? <b>Rav says</b> that he may choose: If he <b>wishes,</b> he can <b>take</b> the cost of the ship’s <b>rent,</b> and if he <b>wishes,</b> he can <b>take</b> the amount by which the value of the ship was <b>diminished</b> by being used for this labor, whichever amount is larger. <b>And Shmuel says: He</b> can <b>take only</b> the amount by which the value of the ship was <b>diminished.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> They <b>do not disagree.</b> They were addressing different cases: <b>This,</b> i.e., Rav’s statement, is referring to a ship <b>that is commonly</b> available <b>for rental. That,</b> i.e., Shmuel’s statement, is referring to a ship that <b>is not commonly</b> available <b>for rental. And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>This and that</b> statement are both referring to a ship <b>that is commonly</b> available <b>for rental. This,</b> Rav’s statement, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the one who seized the ship <b>descended,</b> i.e., took possession, <b>with the intention of renting</b> the ship. He pays for the rental. <b>That,</b> Shmuel’s statement, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the one who seized the ship <b>descended with the intention of robbery,</b> to use it without paying. He is regarded as a robber and pays only the amount by which its value was diminished.
§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>a coin and it cracked,</b> he pays the value of the coin at the time of the robbery, as he has acquired it due to its change. But if the coin was invalidated, he says: That which is yours is before you. Since this is not a significant change, he has not acquired it. The Sages disagree with regard to the explanation of this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> When the mishna states that the coin <b>cracked,</b> it means that it <b>actually cracked;</b> when it says that the coin was <b>invalidated,</b> it means that it was <b>invalidated by the government</b> and is therefore unfit for use.
<b>And Rav Yehuda says:</b> A coin <b>invalidated by the government is</b> the same as a coin that is <b>cracked,</b> because its complete loss of value is a significant change. <b>But what are the circumstances</b> of the mishna, in which a coin that was <b>invalidated</b> is not considered changed? It is a case <b>where</b> a coin <b>was invalidated</b> by the government in <b>this province,</b> and the residents there can no longer use it, <b>but</b> the coin still <b>circulates</b> and is in use <b>in another province.</b>
The Gemara clarifies Rav Huna’s opinion. <b>Rav Ḥisda said to Rav Huna: According to your</b> opinion, <b>that you said</b> that the term <b>invalidated</b> means that the coin was <b>invalidated</b> by the <b>government,</b> and the mishna rules that in that case the robber can return it as is, there is a difficulty. <b>But</b> what of the cases in the mishna of one who robbed another of <b>produce and it rotted</b> or one who robbed another of <b>wine and it fermented, which are similar to</b> a coin that was <b>invalidated by the government,</b> since none of these items are fit for use, <b>and</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the robber <b>pays according to</b> their value at <b>the time of the robbery</b> because they underwent a change? Why would the <i>halakha</i> be different in the case of a coin that was invalidated by the government?
Rav Huna <b>said to him: There,</b> in the cases of produce and wine, <b>its taste and its smell changed. Here,</b> in the case of the coin that was invalidated, the coin itself <b>did not change.</b>
The Gemara clarifies Rav Yehuda’s opinion. <b>Rava said to Rav Yehuda: According to your</b> opinion, <b>that you said</b> that a coin that was <b>invalidated by the government is</b> the same as one that <b>cracked,</b> and the mishna rules that in that case the robber pays according to its value at the time of the robbery, there is a difficulty. <b>But</b> what of the case in the mishna of one who robbed another of <b><i>teruma</i> and it became impure, which is similar to</b> a coin that was <b>invalidated by the government, and</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the robber <b>says to</b> the robbery victim: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b>
Rav Yehuda <b>said to him: There,</b> in the case of <i>teruma</i>, <b>the damage is not evident,</b> since it is impossible to tell the difference between pure and impure items. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the coin, <b>the damage is evident,</b> since one can tell by looking at it that it is the type of coin that was invalidated.
§ With regard to a coin that was invalidated, it <b>was stated</b> that there was a dispute concerning the question: In the case of <b>one who lends</b> money to <b>another on</b> the condition that he repay the loan using a particular kind of <b>coin, and that coin becomes invalidated, Rav says:</b>

Daf 97b

The debtor <b>gives him a coin that is in circulation at that time</b> with which he repays the loan. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that the debtor <b>can say to</b> the creditor: I am giving you a coin like the one you gave me, although you cannot utilize it here. <b>Go spend it in Meishan,</b> i.e., a distant place where this coin is still in circulation. <b>Rav Naḥman said: Shmuel’s statement is reasonable when</b> the creditor <b>has a way to go to Meishan,</b> i.e., he intends to travel there, and therefore the debtor can tell him to spend the coin when he arrives at his destination. <b>But</b> if <b>he has no way</b> to go to Meishan, i.e., he does not intend to go there, the debtor may <b>not</b> give him these coins. Rather, he must give him coins that are in circulation in their current location.
<b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 1:6): <b>One cannot desacralize</b> second-tithe produce by transferring its sanctity <b>onto coins that are not in circulation. How so? If one had coins of bar Kokheva [<i>Kozeviyyot</i>],</b> coins <b>of Jerusalem, or</b> coins <b>of earlier kings,</b> all of which are no longer in use, one <b>cannot desacralize</b> second<b>-</b>tithe produce by transferring its sanctity onto them. Rava infers: <b>But</b> if one had coins <b>of later,</b> i.e., current, kings, that are <b>similar to</b> the coins of the <b>earlier</b> kings in that they have been invalidated in his location, since they are still valid elsewhere, one <b>can desacralize</b> the second-tithe produce by transferring its sanctity onto them. The <i>baraita</i> does not make a distinction as to whether the owner of the produce intends to travel to the location where those coins are in use or not.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: With what are we dealing here</b> in the <i>baraita</i>? We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the <b>kingdoms are not particular with one another.</b> They allow a coin that has been invalidated in their province to be taken out of their borders and spent in a province where it is valid. Since these coins can be given to those planning to travel to the location where it is valid, it is considered to be a valid coin even in the location of the one desacralizing the second-tithe produce.
The Gemara asks: <b>But,</b> according to this explanation, <b>when Shmuel said</b> that the debtor can repay his debt with invalidated coins only if the creditor intends to travel to a location where they are valid, he is speaking of a case <b>where</b> the <b>kingdoms are particular with each other.</b> If so, <b>how can he bring</b> these coins to Meishan without the authorities confiscating them? The Gemara responds: Shmuel is discussing a case <b>where</b> the creditor can <b>bring them with difficulty,</b> as in a case <b>where</b> the authorities <b>do not search, but if they find</b> any invalid coins <b>they are particular</b> to confiscate them. It is therefore possible to bring these coins into the other kingdom. Nevertheless, since the authorities are particular, one who does not plan to travel there will not be able to exchange these coins with anyone in his location.
The Gemara questions Shmuel’s opinion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 1:6): <b>One cannot desacralize</b> second-tithe produce by transferring its sanctity <b>onto money of</b> Eretz Yisrael, i.e., <b>here,</b> when <b>they,</b> the coins and their owner, <b>are in Babylonia. And</b> one cannot do so onto money <b>of Babylonia when they,</b> the coins and their owner, <b>are here</b> in Eretz Yisrael. If one uses money <b>of Babylonia and they are in Babylonia,</b> one <b>can desacralize</b> the second-tithe produce. <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches:</b> One <b>cannot desacralize</b> second-tithe produce by transferring its sanctity <b>onto money of</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>here,</b> when <b>they are in Babylonia.</b> And this is stated <b>even though they will ultimately ascend to there,</b> Eretz Yisrael, as the very purpose of transferring the sanctity to the coins is to spend them in Jerusalem.
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the <b>kingdoms are</b> especially <b>particular with one another,</b> and it is impossible to transport coins from one location to the other. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if the kingdoms are especially particular with one another, then with regard to the case in the <i>baraita</i>, in which sanctity is transferred onto money <b>of Babylonia and they are in Babylonia, for what are these</b> coins <b>fit?</b> In any case they cannot be brought to Jerusalem. The Gemara responds: <b>They are fit for purchasing an animal with them</b> in Babylonia <b>that will be brought up to Jerusalem.</b>
With regard to the statement of the <i>baraita</i>, that one cannot desacralize second-tithe produce by transferring its sanctity onto Babylonian money when in Eretz Yisrael, the Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Sages <b>instituted that</b> all <b>money shall circulate in Jerusalem because of this reason,</b> i.e., so that Jews from all locations will be able to use their local currencies? <b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that all money is valid in Jerusalem is referring to <b>a time when the authority of the Jewish people is dominant over the nations of the world</b> and could enforce the rabbinic enactments. <b>There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> that states that sanctity may not be transferred onto Babylonian money when in Eretz Yisrael, is referring to <b>a time when the authority of the nations of the world is dominant over them,</b> i.e., the Jews, at which time foreign currency was not usable in Jerusalem.
Having mentioned the coins of Jerusalem, the Gemara notes: <b>The Sages taught: What is</b> the <b>coin of</b> ancient <b>Jerusalem?</b> The names <b>David and Solomon</b> were inscribed <b>on one side, and Jerusalem the Holy City</b> was <b>on</b> the <b>other side. And what is</b> the <b>coin of Abraham our forefather? An old man and an old woman,</b> representing Abraham and Sarah, were inscribed <b>on one side, and a young man and a young woman,</b> representing Isaac and Rebecca, were <b>on</b> the <b>other side.</b>
§ <b>Rava inquired of Rav Ḥisda: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>one who lends</b> money to <b>another on</b> the condition that he repay the loan in <b>coin,</b> i.e., with the specific denomination of a currency, <b>and</b> the government <b>added to</b> the size of the coin, so that a coin of the same denomination now weighs more? Is the debtor obligated to return the newly adjusted coin, or can he repay the debt according to the prior weight of the coin that he borrowed? Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: He gives him</b> the <b>coin that is in circulation at the time</b> of the payment. Rava <b>said to him: And</b> is this the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if the new coin is as large <b>as a sieve?</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: Yes.</b> Rava <b>said to him:</b> And is this the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if it is as large <b>as a quarter-<i>kav</i> [<i>tartiya</i>]?</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: Yes.</b>
Rava challenged: <b>But</b> by increasing the weight of this coin, the <b>produce has decreased in price,</b> and since more produce can be purchased with this coin, giving it to the creditor as repayment is a form of interest. <b>Rav Ashi said: We examine</b> the situation: <b>If</b> the produce <b>decreased in price due to</b> the change in the weight of <b>the coin,</b> the debt <b>is reduced for</b> the debtor and the creditor is repaid with coins that equal the prior value of the loan.

Daf 98a

<b>And if</b> the produce <b>decreased in price due to the market</b> value, the debt <b>is not reduced for him.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the value of the coin <b>has</b> been <b>enhanced for the purpose of</b> melting it down into <b>a bar of metal.</b> Since this coin now contains a larger quantity of metal, if it were to be melted it would be worth more than an earlier coin of the same type, so it should be considered interest. <b>Rather,</b> in this case one must act <b>in accordance with how Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> acted when they <b>performed an action with the dinars of Agardamis the Arab merchant [<i>tayya’a</i>]:</b> They considered <b>up to ten</b> old coins to be the equivalent <b>of eight</b> new coins. Since ten old coins were equivalent in value to eight new coins, they paid eight new coins in exchange for ten old ones.
§ <b>Rabba says: One who throws another’s coin into the Great Sea is exempt</b> from liability. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? He can <b>say:</b> The coin <b>is resting before you; if you wish, take it.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And this statement</b> applies only if the coin is <b>in translucent</b> water, <b>where</b> the owner of the coin <b>can see</b> the coin, <b>but</b> in <b>turbid</b> water, <b>where he cannot see</b> the coin, it does <b>not</b> apply, and the one that threw it will be liable to compensate the owner. <b>And this statement</b> applies only <b>when he rolled</b> the coin into the sea without picking it up, <b>but</b> if he <b>took</b> the coin <b>with his hands</b> and threw it into the sea, <b>he has robbed</b> the owner of <b>it, and</b> the robber <b>is required to perform</b> the mitzva of <b>returning</b> the coin to its owner.
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabba from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ma’aser Sheni</i> 1:6): One <b>cannot desacralize</b> second tithe by transferring its sanctity <b>onto money that is not in his possession. How so?</b> If <b>he had money in a fortress [<i>kastera</i>], or in the King’s Mountain [<i>Har HaMelekh</i>], or if his purse fell into the Great Sea,</b> one <b>may not desacralize</b> second tithe by transferring its sanctity onto that money. This indicates that money that fell into the Great Sea is considered lost. <b>Rabba said:</b> This is not difficult; it <b>is different with regard to</b> second <b>tithe, since it is necessary</b> that the money be <b>found in the hand</b> of the one who wishes to desacralize the tithe, <b>as the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “Then you shall turn it into money, <b>and bind up the money in your hand,</b> and shall go to the place that the Lord your God shall choose” (Deuteronomy 14:25), <b>and</b> if it is in the Great Sea, <b>it is not</b> in his hand, but nevertheless it is not considered lost.
<b>And Rabba</b> also <b>says: One who effaces</b> the image of <b>another’s coin is exempt</b> from paying damages, even though he caused the coin to lose value. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As he did not do anything,</b> the coin remains the same size as before. The Gemara comments: <b>And this statement</b> applies only in a case where <b>he struck it with a hammer [<i>kurnesa</i>] and flattened it; but</b> if <b>he filed it with a file [<i>shofina</i>]</b> he must pay the amount of the reduction in value, since <b>he caused it to diminish</b> in size.
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> to the statement of Rabba from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:26): If a master <b>struck</b> his slave <b>on his eye and blinded it,</b> or <b>on his ear and deafened it, the slave is emancipated by means of these</b> injuries. If he struck the slave <b>near his eye and</b> as a result <b>he does not see,</b> or <b>near his ear and he does not hear, the slave is not emancipated by means of these</b> injuries. The first clause indicates that one is liable for damage caused even if it is not visible damage.
The Gemara responds: <b>Rabba</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rabba says: One who deafens his father is put to death,</b> even though no bruise is visible, <b>because it is impossible for deafening</b> to occur <b>without a bruise,</b> as it is certain <b>that a drop of blood fell into his ear</b> from the blow, even if it is not visible from the outside. Striking someone in the ear in a manner that causes deafness results in a significant physical change, while striking a coin with a hammer does not detract from the actual size of the coin.
<b>And Rabba</b> also <b>says: One who slits the ear of another’s cow is exempt</b> from paying damages, even though this cow is no longer fit to be sacrificed as an offering due to the injury. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As</b> the <b>cow was available</b> for many uses until now, so <b>it is</b> still <b>available</b> for those uses now, <b>since</b> the one who slit its ear <b>did not do anything</b> to damage the cow in a substantial way. <b>And</b> concerning the fact that it is rendered disqualified from being sacrificed as an offering, <b>not all oxen stand near the altar,</b> i.e., most animals are not sacrificed as offerings anyway, so it is not considered a loss.
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who performs a task with</b> the <b>water of purification,</b> i.e., the water that is mixed with the ashes of the red heifer and sprinkled upon one who has become impure as part of the purification ritual, <b>or with</b> the red <b>heifer of purification,</b> whose ashes are mixed with springwater and sprinkled on those who have contracted impurity imparted by a corpse on the third and seventh days of their impurity, is <b>exempt according to human laws,</b> since he has not caused any discernible damage, <b>but</b> is <b>liable according to the laws of Heaven.</b> It may be inferred from here that one is exempt from liability according to human laws only if he performed <b>a task</b> with those items, <b>since the damage</b> that he caused <b>is not evident, but</b> in the case of one who <b>slits</b> the ear, <b>where the damage is evident,</b> he is <b>indeed liable according to human laws.</b>
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>The same is true that even one who slits</b> the ear <b>is exempt</b> according to human laws, <b>and</b> the <i>baraita</i> that specified cases where the damage is not evident <b>teaches us this: That even</b> one who performs <b>a task</b> with the water of purification or the red heifer, <b>where the damage is not evident, is liable according to the laws of Heaven.</b>
<b>And Rabba</b> also <b>says: One who burns another’s</b> promissory <b>note is exempt, as</b> the one who burned it can <b>say to him: I have burned</b> only <b>your paper,</b> and he is not held liable for the fact that the creditor will no longer be able to prove that he had provided the loan. <b>Rami bar Ḥama objects to this: What are the circumstances?</b>

Daf 98b

<b>If there are witnesses who know what was</b> written <b>in the</b> promissory <b>note, they should write a</b> new, <b>proper,</b> promissory <b>note for him,</b> and there will not be any loss. <b>And if there are no witnesses, how do we know</b> what was written in the promissory note in order to assess liability? <b>Rava says: Let it</b> refer to a case <b>where</b> the one who burned the promissory note <b>trusts</b> the creditor with regard to the details of the promissory note. Despite the concession of the one who burned the promissory note with regard to the amount of the debt, Rabba holds that he is exempt, since the value of the debt is not inherent in the actual paper.
<b>Rav Dimi bar Ḥanina said: This</b> statement <b>of Rabba is</b> the subject of <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis. According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that <b>an item that causes financial</b> loss <b>is considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value, the one who burned the promissory note <b>is liable. According to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that <b>an item that causes financial</b> loss <b>is not considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value, he <b>is not liable.</b> Rabba holds in accordance with the Rabbis, and therefore rules that one who burns a promissory note is exempt from liability.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, objects to this: Say that you heard</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon,</b> that <b>an item that causes financial</b> loss <b>is considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value, <b>with regard to</b> a case where he damaged <b>an item that</b> has <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabba. As Rabba says:</b> If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>leavened bread before Passover, and another came and burned it during the festival</b> of Passover, when the leavened bread had already become forbidden, the one who burned it is <b>exempt</b> from paying the robber, <b>as all are commanded to destroy</b> the leavened bread, and he therefore performed a mitzva. If he burned it <b>after Passover,</b> that is the matter of <b>dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis.</b>
Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, explains: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that <b>an item that causes financial</b> loss <b>is considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value, the one who burned it is <b>liable,</b> and he must pay the robber. Although it is prohibited to derive benefit from leavened bread, the robber could have returned it to the victim and been exempt from liability. Now that it has been burned, the robber will have to pay the monetary value of the leavened bread at the time of the theft. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> that <b>an item that causes financial</b> loss <b>is not considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value, he is <b>exempt.</b> But <b>with regard to an item</b> such as a promissory note, <b>which</b> has <b>no intrinsic monetary</b> value, <b>do we say</b> that in Rabbi Shimon’s opinion it too is considered to have monetary value?
The Gemara cites a ruling for the case where one burns the promissory note of another. <b>Ameimar said: The one who rules</b> that there is <b>liability</b> for damage caused by <b>indirect</b> action <b>collects, in this</b> case, the <b>value of a proper</b> promissory <b>note,</b> i.e., the amount of the debt, from the one who burned the promissory note. <b>The one who rules</b> that there is <b>no liability</b> for damage caused by <b>indirect</b> action <b>collects, in this</b> case, <b>merely</b> the <b>value of the paper.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>there was an incident</b> like this one, <b>and Rafram forced Rav Ashi,</b> who had burned a document in his youth, to pay damages, <b>and he collected</b> payment, <b>in this</b> case, <b>as</b> if he had damaged <b>a beam</b> used <b>for</b> crafting <b>a sculpture,</b> i.e., he paid him the value of the debt listed in the promissory note.
§ The mishna teaches that if one robbed another of <b>leavened bread, and Passover elapsed over it,</b> and it is therefore prohibited to derive benefit from it, the robber <b>says to</b> his victim: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that <b>with regard to items from which benefit is forbidden</b> one <b>says: That which is yours is before you? Rav Ḥisda said: It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 5:4): If there was <b>an ox that killed</b> a person and is consequently liable to be stoned, and <b>before</b> the court <b>sentenced it</b> the owner <b>sold</b> the ox, the <b>sale</b> is valid; if <b>he consecrated it,</b> the <b>consecration</b> is valid; if <b>he slaughtered it, its flesh is permitted;</b> if <b>a bailee returned it to its owner, it is returned.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: By contrast, <b>from when it was sentenced</b> to be stoned it is prohibited to derive benefit from it, and if the owner <b>sold it,</b> the <b>sale</b> is <b>not</b> valid; if <b>he consecrated it,</b> the <b>consecration</b> is <b>not</b> valid; if <b>he slaughtered it, its flesh is forbidden;</b> if <b>a bailee returned it to its owner, it is not returned,</b> as once it is prohibited to derive benefit from it, the ox is worthless. <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says: Even after it was sentenced,</b> if <b>a bailee returned it to its owner, it is returned.</b>
Rav Ḥisda completes his analysis: <b>What, is it not that they disagree about this</b> issue, <b>that Rabbi Ya’akov holds</b> that <b>with regard to items from which benefit is forbidden</b> one can <b>say: That which is yours is before you, and the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>with regard to items from which benefit is forbidden</b> one <b>cannot say: That which is yours is before you?</b>
<b>Rabba said to him</b> in response: <b>No.</b> It may be <b>that everyone</b> agrees that <b>with regard to items from which benefit is forbidden</b> one can <b>say: That which is yours is before you,</b> and the ruling of the mishna is also in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>As if so,</b> i.e., if it were true that the dispute in the <i>baraita</i> between the Rabbis and Rabbi Ya’akov concerns the general question of returning an item from which benefit is forbidden, <b>they should disagree with regard to</b> the case of <b>leavened bread on Passover</b> and whether it can be returned as is, since this is a clear case of an item from which benefit is forbidden. <b>Rather, Rabba said: Here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>they disagree with regard to</b> a different issue: Can <b>an ox be sentenced in its absence?</b>
Rabba explains the dispute: <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that <b>an ox may not be sentenced in its absence,</b> and therefore the bailee is liable to pay. The reason is <b>that</b> when the ox is returned after its sentencing, the owner may <b>say to</b> the bailee: <b>Had you brought</b> the ox <b>to me</b> before sentencing, <b>I would have chased it away into the marsh,</b> preventing the sentencing from taking place. <b>Now,</b> since you did not return it to me before it was given to the court, <b>you have given it to one with whom I cannot litigate,</b> as the court was sure to sentence it. Therefore you must pay me and not return the ox. <b>And Rabbi Ya’akov holds</b> that <b>an ox may be sentenced</b> even <b>in its absence,</b> and the claim of the owner of the ox is not accepted. The reason is <b>that</b> the bailee may <b>say to</b> the owner in response: <b>What did I do</b> to the ox? <b>Ultimately it would have been sentenced in its absence</b> and rendered forbidden.
The Gemara relates an incident: <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who stated that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Ya’akov and not the Rabbis, <b>found Rabba bar Shmuel</b> and <b>said to him: Did you learn anything</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of returning stolen <b>items from which benefit is forbidden?</b> Rabba bar Shmuel <b>said to him: Yes, we learned</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “Then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, <b>that he shall restore the item</b> that he robbed” (Leviticus 5:23). <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “That he robbed”?</b> It means that the robber must <b>return the same</b> item <b>that he robbed.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From here</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> that if one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>a coin and</b> it <b>was invalidated,</b> or of <b>produce and</b> it <b>rotted,</b> or of <b>wine and</b> it <b>fermented,</b> or of <b><i>teruma</i> and</b> it <b>became ritually impure,</b> or of <b>leavened bread and Passover elapsed over it,</b> or of <b>an animal and a sin was performed with it, or</b> of <b>an ox that had not been sentenced, he</b> can <b>say to</b> the robbery victim: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>Who did you hear say</b> that <b>before the ox was sentenced</b> it <b>can be</b> returned, but <b>after it was sentenced it cannot?</b> It is <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Ya’akov in the <i>baraita</i>; <b>and</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that if one robbed another of <b>leavened bread and Passover elapsed over it, he</b> can <b>say to</b> the robbery victim: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b> This disproves the analysis of Rav Ḥisda, as even the Rabbis agree that an item from which benefit is forbidden is returned as is. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to</b> Rabba bar Shmuel: <b>If you find</b> the Sages, <b>do not say anything to them,</b> i.e., do not publicize that I erred.
§ The Gemara discusses the <i>baraita</i>, which states that if one robbed another of <b>produce and it rotted, he</b> can <b>say to</b> the robbery victim: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (96b): If one robbed another of <b>produce and it rotted, he pays</b> compensation <b>according to</b> the value of the stolen item at <b>the time of the robbery? Rav Pappa said: Here,</b> the mishna is referring to a case where the stolen produce <b>all rotted,</b> which constitutes a significant change. The robber acquires the produce and must pay what its value was at the time of the robbery. <b>There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where <b>part of</b> the stolen produce <b>rotted.</b> In such a case the robber may return it and say: That which is yours is before you.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>gave</b> items <b>to craftsmen to fix and they damaged</b> them, the craftsmen are <b>liable to pay</b> for the damage. For example, if one <b>gave a chest, a box, or a cabinet to a carpenter to fix, and he damaged</b> it, he is <b>liable to pay. And a builder who committed to demolish a wall and</b> while demolishing it he <b>broke the stones, or who damaged them,</b> is <b>liable to pay.</b> If <b>he was demolishing on this side</b> of the wall, <b>and</b> the wall <b>fell from another side</b> and caused damage, he is <b>exempt</b> from liability. <b>But if</b> a stone fell and caused damage <b>due to</b> the force of <b>the blow,</b> he is <b>liable.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one gave a carpenter a chest, a box, or a cabinet to fix, and he damaged it, the carpenter is liable to pay for the damage. <b>Rav Asi says:</b> The Sages <b>taught</b> that a carpenter is liable to pay damages <b>only</b> in a case where one <b>gave the carpenter a chest, a box, or a cabinet to drive a nail into them,</b> i.e., he gave the carpenter complete vessels to repair, <b>and he drove the nail into them and broke them. But</b> if one <b>gave wood to a carpenter to build a chest, a box, or a cabinet, and he built a chest, a box, or a cabinet from</b> the wood, <b>and</b> before giving it to the owner the carpenter <b>broke them,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying for the damage caused to these vessels, and must pay only for the damage caused to the wood.
<b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is because <b>a craftsman acquires</b> ownership rights <b>through</b> the <b>enhancement of the vessel.</b> The craftsman is considered to have acquired the vessel through his work, which enhances its value, and it remains in his possession until he returns it to the owners. Consequently, if he damages the vessel in any way, he is damaging his own item, and must return only the value of the raw materials to the owners.
The Gemara attempts to contradict Rav Asi’s statement: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that if one <b>gave</b> items <b>to craftsmen</b> to fix <b>and they damaged</b> them, they are <b>liable to pay</b> for the damage. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where he gave them wood,</b> and they nevertheless pay the owner the value of a vessel? The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is referring to a case where he gave them <b>a chest, a box, or a cabinet</b> to repair.
The Gemara asks: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> about <b>a chest, a box, or a cabinet, it may be inferred that the first clause</b> of the mishna is referring to <b>wood.</b> The Sages <b>say</b> in response: The latter clause <b>is explaining</b> the first clause. After stating that the craftsmen are liable to pay damages, the mishna explains: <b>In what</b> case is it so that if one <b>gave</b> items <b>to craftsmen to fix, and they damaged</b> them, they are <b>liable to pay?</b> It is with regard to a case <b>where</b> one <b>gave a carpenter a chest, a box, or a cabinet.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And so too, it is reasonable</b> to say <b>that</b> the latter clause of the mishna <b>teaches in what</b> case the first clause deems them liable, <b>as, if it enters your mind</b> to think that <b>the first clause</b> is referring to a case where he gave <b>wood,</b> one could ask: <b>Now</b> that the mishna <b>told us</b> that if one gave <b>wood,</b> the craftsman <b>is liable to pay</b> the value of a vessel, <b>and we do not say</b> that <b>a craftsman acquires</b> ownership rights <b>through</b> the <b>enhancement of vessels, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to tell us that if one gave <b>a chest, a box, or a cabinet,</b> the craftsman is liable to pay damages?
The Gemara dismisses this proof: <b>If it is due to that</b> reason, i.e., if that is the manner in which the explanation of the mishna is refuted, <b>there is no</b> conclusive <b>argument,</b> because that claim can be refuted by saying that the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught the latter clause to shed light on the first clause, so that you would not say</b> that <b>the first clause</b> is referring to a case where one gave the carpenter <b>a chest, a box, or a cabinet, but</b> had he given <b>wood,</b> the carpenter would <b>not</b> be liable. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches</b> the case of one who gave a carpenter <b>a chest, a box, or a cabinet</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> and it follows <b>by inference that the first clause</b> discusses one who gave the carpenter <b>wood, and even so</b> the carpenter <b>is liable to pay</b> damages. It is therefore impossible to prove Rav Asi’s statement from the mishna.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that a mishna (100b) <b>supports</b> the opinion of Rav Asi: With regard to <b>one who gives wool to a dyer</b>

Daf 99a

<b>and it was burned in the cauldron</b> in which it was dyed, the dyer <b>gives</b> the owner the <b>value of his wool.</b> The Gemara infers: The <b>value of his wool, yes,</b> the dyer must pay that amount, but the <b>value of the wool and its enhanced</b> value, <b>no,</b> he need not pay. The Gemara suggests: Is this <b>not</b> referring to a case where the wool <b>was burned after falling</b> into the cauldron and the dye had taken hold, so <b>that there is enhanced</b> value, <b>and</b> one can <b>learn from</b> the mishna that <b>a craftsman acquires</b> ownership rights <b>through</b> the <b>enhancement of the vessel,</b> and therefore the dyer need not pay the enhanced value?
<b>Shmuel said:</b> This is not a proof. <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the wool <b>was burned at the moment of falling</b> into the cauldron, before the dye had taken hold, so <b>that there is no enhancement.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to this opinion, <b>what</b> would the <i>halakha</i> be if <b>it was burned after falling</b> into the cauldron, when the dye had taken hold? Would the dyer <b>give</b> the owner the <b>value of his wool and its enhancement? Shall we say</b> that <b>Shmuel does not accept</b> the statement <b>of Rav Asi,</b> and holds that a craftsman does not acquire ownership rights through the enhancement of the vessel?
The Gemara rejects this statement. <b>Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: With what are we dealing here</b> in the mishna? We are dealing with a case <b>where the wool and herbs</b> used in the dye both <b>belong to the homeowner, and the dyer is taking</b> only the <b>payment of his hand,</b> i.e., the wages for his labor, and nothing else. In this case, the craftsman does not acquire ownership rights through the enhancement of the vessel, but in a case where the craftsman provides the materials, he does acquire such rights.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> i.e., if the homeowner’s herbs were also ruined by the dyer, the mishna <b>should have</b> said that the dyer <b>gives</b> the owner the <b>value of his wool and herbs,</b> not just the value of his wool. <b>Rather, Shmuel is</b> merely <b>dismissing</b> the Gemara’s proof with regard to the statement of Rav Asi that a craftsman acquires a vessel through its enhancement, by saying that the mishna could be understood otherwise. He does not, however, state his own opinion on this matter.
The Gemara offers another suggestion: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who gave his garment to a craftsman,</b> and the craftsman <b>concluded</b> the work <b>and notified</b> the owner that the work was complete, <b>even</b> if the owner delays paying the craftsman <b>from now until ten days</b> henceforth, <b>he does not violate, for this</b> delay, the prohibition <b>of:</b> “You shall not oppress your neighbor, nor rob him; the wages of a hired worker <b>shall not abide with you all night</b> until the morning” (Leviticus 19:13). If the craftsman <b>gave</b> the garment <b>to him at midday,</b> then <b>once the sun has set</b> and the owner has not paid him, the owner <b>does violate, for this</b> delay, the prohibition <b>against delaying</b> the payment of wages.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>a craftsman acquires</b> ownership rights <b>through</b> the <b>enhancement of the vessel, why does</b> the owner <b>violate</b> the prohibition <b>against delaying</b> the payment of wages? It is as if the craftsman acquired the garment, and the payment is considered to be a purchase of the garment by the owner, rather than a wage.
The Gemara responds: <b>Rav Mari, son of Rav Kahana, said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is stating the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the laundering of a thick garment, where there is no enhancement</b> of the garment. Therefore, the craftsman does not acquire it.
The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately, to what</b> end <b>did</b> the owner of the garment <b>give it to</b> the craftsman? He gave it to him in order <b>to soften</b> it. <b>Once he has softened it, that is its enhancement,</b> and the craftsman has therefore acquired it. The Gemara responds: <b>No;</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>hired</b> the craftsman <b>for treading,</b> i.e., to forcefully tread on the garment in water until it softens, with the owner paying the craftsman <b>a <i>ma’a</i></b> coin <b>for each tread.</b> The difference is <b>that this is</b> considered <b>hired</b> labor, where the craftsman is paid based on the amount of times he performed an action, and not contractual labor, where he is paid based on the outcome, in this case, a softened garment.
The Gemara comments: <b>And with regard to what entered our minds initially, that</b> the owner <b>did not hire</b> the worker <b>for treading</b> but rather he hired him like a craftsman based on the assumption that the garment would be returned laundered, this <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Sheshet. As they asked Rav Sheshet:</b> If one hires <b>a contractor,</b> who is not paid an hourly wage but is paid upon the completion of his task, and the one who hired him does not pay him on the day that he completes the work, does he <b>violate, for this</b> delay, the <b>prohibition against delaying</b> the payment of wages, <b>or</b> does he <b>not violate</b> the prohibition? <b>And Rav Sheshet said to them:</b> He does <b>violate</b> the prohibition.
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> based on this statement <b>that Rav Sheshet disagrees with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Asi,</b> who holds that a craftsman acquires ownership rights through the enhancement of the vessel, and his payment is not considered to be a wage? <b>Shmuel bar Aḥa said:</b> Rav Sheshet is discussing a specific type of contractor, and he stated his ruling <b>with regard to an agent</b> tasked with the delivery <b>of a letter,</b> in which case, since the contractor’s only task is to deliver the letter, there is no enhancement through which he might acquire ownership rights. Consequently the prohibition against delaying the payment of wages applies.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the statement of Rav Asi, that a craftsman acquires ownership rights through the enhancement of the vessel, is the <b>subject of</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>.</b> As it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If a woman gave gold to a goldsmith, instructing him: <b>Fashion bracelets, earrings, or rings for me, and I will be betrothed to you</b> as payment for your work, then <b>once he has fashioned them she is betrothed;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: She is not betrothed until money enters her possession.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this <b>money</b> mentioned by the Rabbis? <b>If we say</b> it means <b>that</b> very <b>money,</b> i.e., the rings she ordered, then <b>by inference Rabbi Meir holds</b> that even <b>that</b> very <b>money is not</b> required in order for the betrothal to take effect. <b>But with what</b> does <b>he betroth her?</b> He has given her nothing but the jewelry. <b>Rather, it is obvious.</b> To <b>what money</b> are the Rabbis referring? They must be referring to when he betroths her via <b>other money,</b> i.e., the payment she owes him for his service. According to the opinion of the Rabbis, in order for the betrothal to take effect he must give her additional money, while according to Rabbi Meir the betrothal takes effect when he gives her the jewelry.
The Gemara prefaces its explanation of the connection to the issue at hand by delineating two assumptions: <b>And</b> those who say that Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis are engaging in a dispute with regard to the issue of a craftsman acquiring ownership rights through the enhancement of a vessel <b>assumed</b> that <b>everyone</b> agrees that the obligation to pay <b>a wage</b> is incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end,</b> i.e., the obligation to pay for a service begins when the hired party commences work, and the sum owed increases as he proceeds. The fact that he is not paid from the time he commences work establishes the wages as a debt. Consequently, the wages now have the status of a loan. <b>And</b> they also assumed that <b>everyone</b> agrees that with regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan</b> that <b>she is not betrothed.</b> She therefore cannot be betrothed to him by not having to pay the wages for his work.
Based on these assumptions, the Gemara asks: <b>What, is it not that they disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>a craftsman acquires</b> ownership rights <b>through</b> the <b>enhancement of the vessel? As Rabbi Meir holds</b> that <b>a craftsman acquires</b> ownership rights <b>through</b> the <b>enhancement of the vessel,</b> and since he owns the enhanced value of the vessel, when he gives the jewelry to her he is giving her something valuable of his own, and she is betrothed. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>a craftsman does not acquire</b> ownership rights <b>through</b> the <b>enhancement of the vessel,</b> and since a craftsman, in this case, the goldsmith, does not own the jewelry, he cannot betroth a woman with it.
The Gemara rejects this explanation of the dispute: <b>No,</b> it is possible that <b>everyone</b> agrees that <b>a craftsman does not acquire</b> ownership rights <b>through</b> the <b>enhancement of the vessel, but here they disagree with regard to</b> the issue of whether the obligation to pay <b>a wage</b> is incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end.</b>
<b>Rabbi Meir holds</b> that the obligation to pay <b>a wage</b> is incurred <b>only at the end</b> of the period for which he was hired, i.e., the owner is obligated to pay only when the work is complete, and therefore the goldsmith’s wages do not have the status of a loan, but of a sum of money that she becomes obligated to give him at that time. If he gives her the jewelry without asking for that money, it is as though he gave the money from his wages to her, and she may be betrothed with it. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that the obligation to pay <b>a wage</b> is incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end,</b> and therefore his wages have the status of a loan, and she cannot be betrothed with them and must be given additional money.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>everyone</b> agrees that the obligation to pay <b>a wage is</b> incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period he was hired <b>to</b> its <b>end, and here they disagree with regard to one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan. As Rabbi Meir holds</b> that with regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is betrothed. And the Rabbis hold</b> that with regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is not betrothed.</b>

Daf 99b

<b>Rava said</b> another interpretation: <b>Everyone</b> agrees that the obligation to pay <b>a wage</b> is incurred continuously <b>from the beginning</b> of the period a craftsman is hired <b>to</b> its <b>end; and everyone</b> agrees that with regard to <b>one who betroths</b> a woman <b>with a loan, she is not betrothed; and everyone</b> agrees that <b>a craftsman does not acquire</b> ownership rights <b>through</b> the <b>enhancement of the vessel.</b>
<b>But with what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he added a jewel [<i>nofekh</i>] of his own for her. Rabbi Meir holds</b> that if a man betroths a woman with <b>a loan and one <i>peruta</i>, her mind is</b> focused <b>on the <i>peruta</i>.</b> Therefore, in this case the jewel serves as the betrothal money. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that if a man betroths a woman with <b>a loan and one <i>peruta</i> her mind is</b> focused <b>on the loan,</b> so the loan serves as the betrothal money, and if one betroths a woman with a loan, she is not betrothed.
<b>And</b> Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis disagree <b>in the dispute</b> between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 3:4): If one says to a woman: Be betrothed to me <b>with the payment for which I have worked for you, she is not betrothed,</b> as the payment is a loan, since she already owes him this money. But if he says: Be betrothed to me <b>with the payment for which I will work for you, she is betrothed,</b> as from the moment he is entitled to the money, he gives it to her for her betrothal. <b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> If he says: Be betrothed to me <b>with the payment for which I will work for you, she is not betrothed,</b> as Rabbi Natan holds that the obligation to pay a wage is incurred continuously from the beginning of the period he was hired to its end, which means that upon the completion of the labor it is a loan, <b>and all the more so</b> if he says: Be betrothed to me <b>with the payment for which I have worked for you.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> cites a third opinion: <b>And Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: Actually they said</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is that regardless of <b>whether</b> he said: <b>With the payment for which I have worked for you, or whether</b> he said: <b>With the payment for which I will work for you, she is not betrothed. But if he added a jewel of his own for her, she is betrothed.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the dispute: <b>What</b> difference <b>is there between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Natan?</b> The difference <b>between them</b> is with regard to <b>a wage:</b> Is the obligation incurred continuously or only upon the completion of the work? The difference <b>between Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi</b> is the issue of <b>a loan and one <i>peruta</i>.</b> Rabbi Natan holds that if a man betroths a woman with a loan and one <i>peruta</i> her mind is focused on the loan, and in this case his jewel is disregarded; and Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that her mind is focused on the <i>peruta</i>, in this case the jewel, and she is betrothed with the jewel.
§ The Gemara now returns to the topic of a craftsman who damages the item with which he is working. <b>Shmuel says: An expert butcher who damaged</b> an animal by slaughtering it incorrectly, thereby rendering it non-kosher, is <b>liable to pay</b> the owner of the animal for the damage. Why? <b>He is one who causes damage; he is negligent; he is like one who is told</b> by the animal’s owner to <b>slaughter it from here,</b> i.e., the area of the throat where ritual slaughter is performed, <b>and he slaughtered it from there,</b> i.e., a different area of the throat, in violation of the owner’s wishes.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why must he say</b> both that the butcher <b>is one who causes damage</b> and that <b>he is negligent?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>If</b> Shmuel had <b>said</b> only that <b>he is one who causes damage, I would say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies only in a case where the butcher slaughtered the animal <b>for pay,</b> in which case, due to the extra responsibility that he bears, he is considered to be one who caused damage and is liable to pay even in a case where the damage was unintentional; <b>but</b> in a case <b>where he does</b> the work <b>for free,</b> I would say <b>no,</b> he is exempt from liability in a case where the damage was unintentional. Shmuel therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the butcher <b>is negligent,</b> and one who works without pay is analogous to an unpaid bailee, who is liable to pay for damage caused by negligence.
<b>Rav Ḥama bar Gurya raised an objection to Shmuel</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i> (10:10): With regard to <b>one who gives an animal to a butcher, and</b> the butcher killed it in a way that <b>rendered it an animal carcass,</b> if the butcher is <b>an expert,</b> then he is <b>exempt</b> from liability; if he is <b>an ordinary</b> person, without particular expertise in the act of ritual slaughter, he is <b>liable. And if</b> the owner of the animal <b>paid</b> the butcher, then regardless of <b>whether</b> he is <b>an ordinary</b> person or <b>whether</b> he is <b>an expert,</b> the butcher is <b>liable</b> to pay for the damage. This indicates that an expert butcher who slaughtered the animal improperly is exempt if he slaughtered it without pay. Shmuel <b>said to him: May your mind be muddled</b> for raising a ridiculous objection.
<b>One of the Sages came and raised</b> the same <b>objection to</b> Shmuel. Shmuel <b>said to him: Now you shall receive what your friend received</b> from me, since <b>I say to you</b> my statement in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and you say to me,</b> i.e., you raise an objection, based upon the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. Why were you not precise</b> in your consideration of <b>my</b> choice of <b>words? As I say: He is one who causes damage; he is negligent; he is like one who is told</b> by the animal’s owner to <b>slaughter it from here, and he slaughtered it from there. Who accepts this reasoning?</b> It is <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: He should have taken upon himself</b> the responsibility to perform his task properly, and if he did not, he is liable to pay for the damage that he caused. The other <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, who exempt him from liability.
The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> is Shmuel referring to? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> that is difficult. Parenthetically, the Gemara states that the letters <b><i>kuf</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>nun</i></b> serve as <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the three statements of Rabbi Meir that will be cited. It stands for: He tied it [<i>kesharo</i>], to dye [<i>litzboa</i>], and broke [<i>nishbera</i>].
The Gemara returns to the matter at hand: <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (45b): If <b>the</b> ox’s <b>owner tied it with reins</b> to a fence <b>or locked</b> the gate <b>before it in an appropriate manner, but</b> nevertheless the ox <b>emerged and caused damage, whether</b> the ox is <b>innocuous or forewarned</b> the owner is <b>liable,</b> since this is not considered sufficient precaution to prevent damage; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> As the Gemara explains on 45b, Rabbi Meir holds that a forewarned ox requires a heightened level of safeguarding, and since the owner did not safeguard it, he is liable. The same would apply here, that one who agrees to perform a task must exercise care in executing it. Otherwise, he will be held liable to pay for damage.
The Gemara explains why this cannot be the statement of Rabbi Meir that Shmuel was referring to: <b>There,</b> in that mishna, the Sages <b>disagree with regard to</b> the interpretation of biblical <b>verses,</b> not logical reasoning, as the Gemara explains there, and conclusions cannot be drawn from that <i>halakha</i> to this one.
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> that Shmuel is referring to, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (100b): If one gave wool to a dyer <b>to dye</b> it <b>red for him, and he dyed it black,</b> or to dye it <b>black, and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The dyer <b>gives</b> the owner <b>the value of his wool,</b> indicating that he is liable to pay for the damage. The Gemara rejects this opinion: This statement also does not prove that according to Rabbi Meir a worker is liable to pay for a job performed improperly, since <b>there,</b> the dyer <b>burned</b> the wool, thereby removing it <b>from</b> the owner <b>by</b> direct <b>action.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> that Shmuel is referring to, <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one’s <b>jug broke</b> on the road <b>and he did not remove it,</b> or if <b>his camel fell</b> on the road <b>and he did not stand it up, Rabbi Meir says: He is liable for the damage</b> that they cause, <b>and the Rabbis say: He is exempt according to human laws but liable according to the laws of Heaven.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>And we maintain</b> that they <b>disagree with regard to</b> the question of whether <b>one who stumbles is</b> considered <b>negligent.</b> According to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, one who stumbles is considered negligent, since he should have paid attention while walking. He is therefore liable for whatever damage he causes. In the case of an expert butcher as well, Rabbi Meir holds that he is considered negligent when damaging the animal he slaughtered, and the Rabbis hold that he is not negligent and therefore exempt from liability.
The Gemara discusses Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion concerning the case of an expert butcher. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: An expert butcher who damaged</b> an animal by slaughtering it incorrectly, thereby rendering it non-kosher, is <b>liable</b> to pay the owner of the animal, <b>and even if he is as expert as the butchers of Tzippori,</b> it is not considered an accident, and he is considered to be at fault. The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> actually <b>say this? But didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say</b> that <b>there was an incident</b> in which a butcher who damaged an animal was brought to court <b>before Rabbi Yoḥanan in the synagogue of</b> the town <b>Maon, and</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> the butcher: <b>Go bring proof that you are an expert at</b> slaughtering <b>chickens, and I will exempt you</b> from payment.
The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the aforementioned incident, the butcher slaughtered the animal <b>for free,</b> and he is therefore exempt, while <b>there,</b> in Rabba bar bar Ḥana’s previous statement, he slaughtered the animal <b>for pay,</b> and is therefore liable to pay for the damage. This is <b>in accordance with that which Rabbi Zeira says: One who wants a butcher to be liable to</b> pay <b>him</b> in the event that he damages the animal during slaughter should <b>advance him a dinar,</b> so that he is paid for his services, and he is consequently liable to pay damages.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the <i>Tosefta</i> (10:9): <b>One who brought wheat</b> to another <b>to grind</b> for him, and the miller <b>did not wet</b> the grains sufficiently for the grinding to be performed effectively, <b>and</b> as a result <b>he converted</b> the grain <b>into bran or coarse bran;</b> or if one gave <b>flour to the baker and he made bread</b> that is <b>underbaked</b> and tends to crumble; or if one gave <b>an animal to a butcher and</b> the butcher killed it in a way that <b>rendered it</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass,</b> the worker is <b>liable, because he is like a paid bailee.</b> This indicates that even if the work was done for free, the worker has the legal status of one who is paid, and he is liable to pay for the damage. The Gemara answers by emending the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Say</b> instead: <b>Because he is a paid bailee</b> and actually receives payment.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> animal that was <b>slaughtered</b> with an incision <b>not in the neck that was brought before Rav.</b> He <b>declared it non-kosher, and exempted the butcher from paying its value. Rav Kahana and Rav Asi encountered that man,</b> i.e., the owner of the animal, and <b>they said to him: Rav did two for you.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> are the <b>two? If we say</b> there were <b>two unfavorable</b> rulings, what are they? One is that <b>he should have declared</b> the animal <b>kosher, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who says that an animal that has been slaughtered in this manner is kosher, <b>and</b> instead he <b>declared it non-kosher, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that it is not kosher. <b>And</b> the second is that <b>even</b> if he holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, he should have</b> ruled that <b>the butcher</b> is <b>liable</b> to pay for the damage. The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But</b> if these are the two that Rav Kahana and Rav Asi are referring to, <b>is it permitted</b> for them <b>to say this type</b> of statement to the owner of the animal?
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>when</b> a judge <b>leaves</b> the courthouse, <b>he should not say</b> to the litigant: <b>I found you innocent and my colleagues found you liable, but what can I do, since my colleagues outnumber me? And</b> it is <b>concerning</b> a circumstance such as <b>this</b> that it <b>is stated: “He that goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets;</b> but he that is of a faithful spirit conceals a matter” (Proverbs 11:13).
<b>Rather,</b> the intention is that they told him that there were <b>two favorable</b> rulings: First, <b>that</b> by declaring the animal to be non-kosher, <b>he did not allow you to eat</b> an item about which there is <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether it is <b>forbidden, and</b> second, by exempting the butcher from paying you, <b>he prevented you</b> from being in a situation where there is <b>uncertainty</b> as to whether receiving payment from the butcher constitutes <b>robbery,</b> since you would have been given the butcher’s money when he may be exempt, as the animal may in fact be kosher.
§ The Gemara continues the discussion of an expert who erred, thereby causing a loss. It <b>was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who presents a dinar to a money changer</b> to assess its value or authenticity and the money changer declares it valid, <b>and it is found</b> to be <b>bad,</b> i.e., invalid, causing its owner a monetary loss, it <b>is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that if the money changer is <b>an expert,</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> while if he is <b>an ordinary</b> person he is <b>liable. And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that irrespective of <b>whether</b> he is <b>an expert</b> or <b>whether</b> he is <b>an ordinary</b> person, he is <b>liable</b> to pay for the owner’s loss.
To reconcile the <i>baraitot</i>, <b>Rav Pappa said: When</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>an expert is exempt</b> from liability, it is referring to renowned experts <b>such as</b> the money changers <b>Dankhu and Issur,</b> whose expertise is so great <b>that they do not need to learn</b> about assessing currency <b>at all.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if they are so proficient, <b>in what did they err?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>They erred with regard to</b> a coin from <b>a new press, which at that time was leaving the press,</b> and they did not know its value.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain woman who presented a dinar to Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> to assess its authenticity. <b>He said to her: It is a proper</b> coin. <b>The next day she came before him and said to him: I presented it</b> to others, <b>and they told me</b> that <b>it is a bad</b> dinar, <b>and I am not</b> able to <b>spend it.</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>said to Rav: Go exchange it for her, and write on my tablet [<i>apinkasi</i>]: This</b> was a <b>bad transaction,</b> as I should not have assessed the coin.
The Gemara asks: <b>But what is different</b> about <b>Dankhu and Issur, who are exempt due to</b> the fact <b>that they do not need to learn</b> about assessing currency? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya too did not need to learn,</b> as he was also an expert. The Gemara responds: <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> was not actually required to return a dinar to this woman, but when he did so <b>he acted beyond the letter of the law.</b> This is <b>as that</b> which <b>Rav Yosef taught</b> concerning the verse: “And you shall show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do” (Exodus 18:20): <b>“And you shall show them”; this</b> is referring to

Daf 100a

<b>the core of their existence,</b> i.e., Torah study, which is the source of life. <b>“The way”; this</b> is referring to <b>acts of kindness. “They must walk”; this</b> is referring to <b>visiting the sick. “Wherein”; this</b> is referring to the <b>burial</b> of the dead. <b>“The work”; this</b> is referring to conducting oneself in accordance with <b>the law. “That they must do”; this</b> is referring to conducting oneself <b>beyond the letter of the law.</b> This indicates that the Torah mandates that people conduct themselves beyond the letter of the law.
The Gemara relates: <b>Reish Lakish presented a dinar to Rabbi Elazar</b> so that the latter would assess it. Rabbi Elazar <b>said: It is a proper</b> coin. Reish Lakish <b>said to him: Realize that I am relying on you.</b> Rabbi Elazar <b>said to him: What</b> is the purpose <b>of stating that you are relying on me?</b> Is it so <b>that if</b> this dinar <b>is</b> later <b>found</b> to be <b>bad, I will be required to exchange it for you</b> with a good dinar? <b>But</b> it is <b>you who said</b> that <b>it is Rabbi Meir</b> who is of the opinion <b>that</b> there is <b>liability</b> for damage caused by <b>indirect</b> action, even if he did not directly cause damage to the property. <b>What, is it not</b> that you intended to say: This is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, but we do not hold in accordance with his</b> opinion?
Reish Lakish <b>said to him: No,</b> I intended to say that this is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and we</b> do <b>hold in accordance with his</b> opinion.
The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir</b> is Rabbi Elazar referring to? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> that is difficult. Parenthetically, the Gemara states that the letters <b><i>dalet</i>, <i>lamed</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>peh</i></b> serve as <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the four statements of Rabbi Meir that will be cited. It stands for: Judged [<i>dan</i>], to dye [<i>litzboa</i>], covers [<i>mesakekh</i>], and broke open [<i>pirtza</i>].
The Gemara returns to the matter at hand. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 28b): If a judge <b>issued a judgment</b> and erred, and he <b>acquitted</b> one who was in fact <b>liable,</b> or <b>deemed liable</b> one who should have in fact been <b>acquitted,</b> or if he <b>ruled</b> that <b>a pure</b> item is <b>impure,</b> or <b>ruled</b> that <b>an impure</b> item is <b>pure,</b> and by doing so he caused a litigant a monetary loss, <b>what he did is done,</b> i.e., the judgment stands, <b>and</b> the judge <b>must pay</b> damages <b>from his home,</b> i.e., from his personal funds. He is therefore liable to pay the damages even though he caused the loss indirectly.
The Gemara explains why this cannot be the statement of Rabbi Meir that Shmuel was referring to: <b>But wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Rabbi Ile’a says</b> that <b>Rav says: And this</b> mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the judge not only issued a ruling, but actively <b>took</b> the money from the one whom he found liable, <b>and gave</b> it to the other party <b>by</b> his own <b>hand.</b> This is not a case of causation but of direct action.
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Elazar must be referring to <b>this</b> statement <b>of Rabbi Meir, as we learned</b> in a mishna (100b): If one gave wool to a dyer <b>to dye</b> it <b>red for him, and he dyed it black,</b> or to dye it <b>black, and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The dyer <b>gives</b> the owner the <b>value of his wool.</b> The Gemara responds: This too does not prove that according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir one is liable even if the loss was brought about by causation, since <b>there he does</b> cause damage <b>through</b> direct <b>action.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Elazar must be referring to <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:4): <b>One who drapes his grapevine atop another’s grain has rendered</b> them <b>forbidden</b> due to the prohibition against growing diverse kinds in a vineyard, <b>and</b> he <b>is liable</b> to pay the owner of the grain for the damage. The Gemara responds: This too does not prove that according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir one is liable even if the loss was brought about by causation, since <b>there too he does</b> cause damage <b>by</b> direct <b>action.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it must be referring to <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Meir, as it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Kilayim</i> 3:4): If there was <b>a partition of a vineyard</b> that is adjacent to a wheat field, and <b>that</b> partition <b>broke open,</b>

Daf 100b

the owner of the wheat field may <b>tell</b> the owner of the vineyard to <b>repair</b> the breach before the vines intermingle with the grain and cause it to become forbidden. If the partition <b>broke open</b> again, he may again <b>tell him</b> to <b>repair</b> it. If the owner of the vineyard <b>abandoned</b> the partition <b>and did not repair it, he has rendered</b> the grain <b>forbidden, and is obligated</b> to pay <b>restitution</b> for <b>it.</b> This demonstrates that one is liable to pay damages even if he did not perform any action at all, and consequently proves that Rabbi Meir rules there is liability for damage caused by indirect action.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who gives wool to a dyer and it was burned in the cauldron</b> during the dyeing process, thereby completely ruining the wool so that there is no enhancement, only loss, the dyer <b>gives</b> the owner <b>the value of his wool.</b> If he <b>dyed it unattractively [<i>ka’ur</i>]</b> so that the dye is not absorbed well by the wool, <b>if the enhancement,</b> i.e., the amount that the value of the wool has increased by being dyed, <b>exceeds the</b> dyer’s <b>expenses,</b> the owner of the wool <b>gives</b> the dyer <b>the expenses. And if the expenses exceed the enhancement, he gives him</b> the value of <b>the enhancement.</b>
If the owner gave wool to a dyer <b>to dye</b> it <b>red for him and</b> instead <b>he dyed it black,</b> or to dye it <b>black and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The dyer <b>gives</b> the owner of the wool <b>the value of his wool. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> Here too, <b>if</b> the value of <b>the enhancement exceeds the</b> dyer’s <b>expenses,</b> the owner of the wool <b>gives</b> the dyer <b>the expenses. And if the expenses exceed the enhancement, he gives him</b> the value of <b>the enhancement.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean by <b>unattractively? Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: <i>Kelabus</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does <b><i>kelabus</i></b> mean? <b>Rabba bar Shmuel said:</b>

Daf 101a

<b>The sediments</b> of dye in <b>the cauldrons,</b> that is, the dyer took the dye remaining in the cauldron from previous use, and used that dye for this garment, leading to an inferior result.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:8): With regard to <b>one who gives wood to a carpenter to fashion a chair from it and he fashioned a bench from it</b> instead, or one who gives him wood to fashion <b>a bench and he fashioned a chair from it</b> instead, <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The carpenter <b>gives him the value of his wood</b> and keeps the chair or bench, as he has acquired it due to the change. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> He does not acquire the item. Rather, <b>if</b> the value of the wood’s <b>enhancement exceeds the</b> carpenter’s <b>expenses</b> the owner <b>gives</b> the carpenter <b>the expenses, and if the expenses exceed the enhancement</b> of the wood <b>he gives him</b> the value of <b>the enhancement.</b> Since the carpenter deviated from the customer’s order, he is entitled to either his expenses or the enhancement, the smaller amount of the two.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And Rabbi Meir concedes</b> that <b>if he gave wood to a carpenter to fashion a beautiful chair from it and he fashioned an ugly chair from it,</b> or to fashion <b>a beautiful bench</b> from it <b>and he fashioned an ugly bench</b> from it, then <b>if</b> the value of the wood’s <b>enhancement exceeds the</b> carpenter’s <b>expenses</b> the owner <b>gives</b> the carpenter <b>the value of the expenses, and if the expenses exceed the enhancement he gives him the value of the enhancement.</b> Since the carpenter did not deviate significantly from the customer’s instructions, Rabbi Meir concedes that the carpenter does not acquire the item due to the change.
§ In connection with the discussion of the halakhic implications of the enhancement of a garment quoted above, the Gemara records that <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: What is the <i>halakha</i>? That <b>the enhancement</b> which <b>dye</b> provides <b>to the wool</b> is <b>substantive,</b> i.e., the dye is considered a separate entity from the wool it dyed? <b>Or is</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the enhancement</b> which <b>dye</b> provides <b>to the wool</b> is <b>not substantive,</b> i.e., the dye does not remain an independent entity, and it is viewed as if there is only colored wool?
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which this dilemma is relevant? <b>If we say that</b> the dilemma arises <b>where one robbed</b> another of <b>pigments, and ground them</b> up <b>and soaked them</b> in water, converting them into dye, <b>and</b> then <b>dyed</b> wool <b>with them,</b> then the dilemma would be concerning how the robber returns the pigments. In this case, <b>derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>due to</b> the fact that the robber <b>acquired</b> the pigments <b>due to a change</b> of form, which occurred when he ground the pigments, and in any event will be obligated to return the value of the pigments at the time of the robbery.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to resolve the dilemma in a case <b>where</b> one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>pigments</b> that had already been <b>soaked</b> in water, <b>and</b> then <b>dyed</b> wool <b>with them. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> here? Is <b>the enhancement</b> which <b>dye</b> provides <b>to</b> the <b>wool substantive,</b> i.e., a separate entity, so <b>that</b> the owner can <b>say to</b> the robber: <b>Give me my dyes that you took? Or perhaps the enhancement</b> which <b>dye</b> provides <b>to the wool</b> is <b>not substantive,</b> but becomes one with the wool, so <b>that</b> the robber can <b>say to</b> the owner: <b>I have nothing at all of yours,</b> since the dyes are no longer considered extant.
The Gemara rejects this understanding of the application of the dilemma. The Sages <b>say: And</b> even <b>if</b> the <b>enhancement</b> which <b>dye</b> provides <b>to</b> the <b>wool is not substantive, can</b> the robber really <b>say to him: I have nothing at all of yours? Let</b> the owner <b>say to him: Give me my dyes that you have</b> caused to be <b>lost.</b> Even if the dyes are no longer considered extant, the owner is still entitled to monetary compensation for the robbery.
<b>Rather,</b> the dilemma is relevant <b>to that</b> other <b>side</b> of the question: Is the <i>halakha</i> that the <b>enhancement</b> which <b>dye</b> provides <b>to the wool is not substantive, and</b> therefore the robber <b>needs</b> to <b>pay him? Or perhaps</b> the <b>enhancement</b> which <b>dye</b> provides <b>to</b> the <b>wool is substantive, and</b> the robber can <b>say to him:</b> The dyes absorbed into the wool <b>lie before you; take them.</b> The Gemara rejects this as well: <b>Take them? With what</b> should he <b>take</b> the dyes, <b>with soap?</b> While <b>soap does remove</b> dye from the wool, <b>it does not return</b> the dye to the robbery victim, as the dye cannot be recovered.
The Gemara suggests another scenario: <b>Rather, with what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he robbed one</b> person of <b>wool and dyes, and dyed that wool with those dyes, and he is returning the</b> dyed <b>wool to him.</b> The dilemma is: Is the <i>halakha</i> that <b>enhancement</b> which <b>dye</b> provides <b>to the wool is substantive, and</b> he <b>is</b> therefore <b>returning</b> both the <b>dye and</b> the <b>wool to him? Or perhaps enhancement</b> which <b>dye</b> provides <b>to</b> the <b>wool is not substantive, and</b> it is only <b>the wool</b> that <b>he is returning to him,</b> but <b>he is not returning the dye to him,</b> since it is no longer extant.
The Gemara rejects this understanding of the application of the dilemma as well. The Sages <b>say: Derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> in this case based on the fact <b>that he increased the value</b> of the wool <b>for him,</b> as dyed wool is more expensive than undyed wool. Consequently, even if the robber has not returned the dye, he reimburses the owner for it when he returns the appreciated wool. The Gemara suggests: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to resolve the dilemma in a case <b>where</b> the cost of <b>the dye has depreciated.</b> If the dye is viewed as an independent entity the robber is returning both the wool and the dye. If it is not, he must reimburse the robbery victim for the value of the dye at the time of the robbery. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: The dilemma is relevant in a case <b>where</b> he robbed another of dye and a basket, and <b>dyed</b> the <b>basket with</b> the dye, in which case the dye does not increase the value of the dyed item.
The Gemara presents an alternative understanding of the case where the dilemma applies. <b>Ravina said: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where there</b> was <b>wool that</b> belonged to <b>one</b> person <b>and dyes that</b> belonged to <b>one</b> other person, <b>and a monkey came and dyed that wool with those dyes.</b> The dilemma is as follows: Is the <i>halakha</i> that <b>enhancement</b> which <b>dye</b> provides <b>to</b> the <b>wool is substantive,</b> so <b>that</b> the owner of the dye can <b>say to</b> the owner of the wool: <b>Give me my dyes that are with you? Or perhaps enhancement</b> which <b>dye</b> provides <b>to</b> the <b>wool is not substantive and</b> the owner of the wool can <b>say to</b> the owner of the dye: <b>There is nothing</b> of yours <b>with me,</b> and he is exempt from liability because the dyes are no longer extant.
Having determined the scenario in which the dilemma is relevant, the Gemara proceeds to resolve the dilemma. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:1): <b>A garment that one dyed with</b> dye extracted from <b>peels of <i>orla</i>,</b> i.e., fruit that grows on a tree during its first three years, <b>must be burned,</b> as it is prohibited to derive benefit from <i>orla</i>. <b>Apparently,</b> the enhancement of an item’s <b>appearance is</b> considered a significant <b>matter,</b> and the dye therefore remains an independent substance even after having been absorbed by the wool.
The Gemara rejects this resolution. <b>Rava said:</b> The reason the garment must be burned is not because the dye remains an independent substance. Rather, it is because <b>the Torah prohibited benefit that is visible to the eye, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: “And shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as forbidden; three years shall it be as <b>forbidden [<i>areilim</i>]</b> to you; <b>it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 19:23). From this verse <b>I have</b> derived <b>only a prohibition</b> against <b>eating</b> it; <b>from where</b> is it derived that one <b>may not</b> even derive <b>benefit from it, and</b> that <b>one may not dye with</b> dyes extracted from the fruit, <b>and</b> that <b>one may not light a lamp with</b> oil extracted from the fruit?
The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>The verse states: “Then you shall count the fruit thereof [<i>orlato</i>] as forbidden [<i>araltem</i>].</b> Three years shall it be as <b>forbidden [<i>areilim</i>]</b> to you; <b>it shall not be eaten”</b> (Leviticus 19:23), <b>to include all these</b> types of benefit in the prohibition. Consequently, there is an explicit derivation that an item dyed with <i>orla</i> dye is forbidden.
The Gemara attempts another resolution of the dilemma. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from that which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A garment that one dyed with</b> dye extracted from <b>the peels of</b> produce from the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year must be <b>burned</b> when the time for the elimination of Sabbatical Year produce arrives. This indicates that the dye evidently remains an independent substance. The Gemara rejects this proof: It <b>is different there, as the verse states: “Shall</b> all the increase thereof <b>be”</b> (Leviticus 25:7), and the phrase: “Shall be,” teaches that it <b>will</b> always <b>remain as it is,</b> i.e., it retains its status as Sabbatical Year produce despite any change to its form.

Daf 101b

The Gemara states that <b>Rava raises a contradiction: We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Orla</i> 3:1): <b>A garment that one dyed with</b> dye extracted from <b>peels of <i>orla</i> must be burned. Apparently,</b> the change in <b>appearance</b> precipitated by the <i>orla</i> peels <b>is</b> considered a significant <b>matter,</b> and the dye retains its status as <i>orla</i>. <b>And raise a contradiction</b> from another mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 3:2): With regard to <b>a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood</b> from a corpse <b>that was absorbed in</b> the floor of <b>a house,</b> every vessel in <b>the house is ritually impure</b> by virtue of being under the same roof as the blood. <b>And some say</b> that any vessel in <b>the house is ritually pure. And</b> these two statements <b>do not disagree,</b> as <b>this</b> first statement was <b>in reference to vessels that were</b> in the house <b>at the outset,</b> before the blood was absorbed; and <b>this</b> second statement was <b>in reference to vessels that came</b> into the house <b>at the end,</b> after the blood had already been absorbed.
The mishna continues: If the blood <b>was absorbed in a garment,</b> it is <b>examined,</b> and <b>if the garment is washed and a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of blood emerges from it,</b> it <b>is ritually impure,</b> and the garment imparts ritual impurity to the vessels in the house as well. <b>But if not,</b> i.e., if less than a quarter-<i>log</i> of blood emerges, then it <b>is pure,</b> and it does not impart impurity. Apparently, only the blood that can be removed from the garment is considered blood, while the blood absorbed in the garment is insignificant. If this is the case, the change in appearance precipitated by the blood is not considered a significant matter, and the blood absorbed in the garment does not remain an independent substance.
The Gemara presents an answer. <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> A <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> among <b>the leniencies</b> applied to the measurements <b>of a quarter</b>-<i>log</i> was <b>taught here,</b> as the mishna is written <b>in reference to the blood of submission</b> that is discharged from a body at the time of death, and such blood is ritually impure <b>by rabbinic law,</b> but in general, a change in appearance precipitated by blood is significant.
§ Having cited a contradiction raised by Rava, the Gemara proceeds to cite another. <b>Rava raises</b> another <b>contradiction. We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 7:1): Concerning plants <b>from</b> among <b>the species that</b> are used as <b>dyes,</b> for example the <b><i>sefiḥin</i>,</b> i.e., produce that grew without being intentionally planted, <b>of woad and safflower; they have</b> sanctity of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>and money</b> exchanged for <b>them has</b> sanctity of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year. Additionally, <b>they are</b> subject to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>eradication, and money</b> exchanged for <b>them is</b> subject to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>eradication. Apparently, wood,</b> a type of inedible growth, <b>is subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical</b> Year despite the fact that it is not edible.
<b>And raise a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>reed leaves and vine leaves that one piled for storage upon the field,</b> if he <b>gathered them for eating, they are subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical</b> Year; if he gathered them <b>for</b> use as <b>wood,</b> e.g., for kindling a fire, <b>they are not subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical</b> Year. Apparently, wood or any other non-food product is not subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year.
<b>And</b> Rava <b>answers</b> the contradiction, as <b>the verse states:</b> “And the Sabbath produce of the land shall be <b>for food</b> for you” (Leviticus 25:6), indicating that the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year takes effect only <b>with regard to those</b> items <b>whose benefit and whose consumption coincide,</b> as is the case with regard to food. <b>Wood is excluded, as its benefit follows its consumption.</b> The primary purpose of kindling wood is not accomplished with the burning of the wood; rather, it is with the charcoal that heats the oven. Therefore, wood is not subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year.
The Gemara objects: <b>But isn’t there wood</b> that is used to provide <b>heat, whose benefit coincides with its consumption,</b> as one enjoys the warmth provided by the fire while the wood is burned?
<b>Rava said:</b>

Daf 102a

<b>Unspecified wood exists for fuel,</b> i.e., charcoal, so its benefit follows its consumption.
<b>Rav Kahana says: And</b> the matter of whether <b>kindling wood,</b> whose benefit follows its consumption, is subject to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year <b>is</b> a dispute among the <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Shevi’it</i> 6:25): <b>One may not transfer Sabbatical</b> Year <b>produce,</b> e.g., wine, to another person; <b>neither for soaking</b> flax to prepare it for spinning, as the benefit derived from the flax follows its soaking, when the soaked and spun thread is woven into a garment; <b>nor or for laundering</b> with it, as the benefit derived follows the laundering when one wears the clean clothes. Soaking the flax or laundering the garment in wine is considered the consumption of the wine, as it is no longer potable. <b>And Rabbi Yosei says: One may transfer</b> to another <b>Sabbatical</b> Year <b>produce for soaking and for laundering.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reasoning</b> for the statement <b>of the Rabbis? The verse states</b> with regard to Sabbatical Year produce: <b>“For food”</b> (Leviticus 25:6), from which it is inferred: <b>But not for soaking; “for food,” but not for laundering. And Rabbi Yosei says</b> that it is permitted, as <b>the verse</b> also <b>states: “For you,”</b> from which it is inferred: For you, <b>for all your needs,</b> even for soaking and for laundering.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis as well, isn’t it written: “For you”?</b> How do they explain that term? The Gemara answers: From that term “for you” it is derived: <b>“For you,” similar to “for food,”</b> i.e., the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year takes effect <b>with regard to those</b> items <b>whose benefit and whose consumption coincide,</b> which <b>excludes soaking and laundering, where</b> the items’ <b>benefit follows their consumption.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yosei as well, isn’t it written: “For food”?</b> Rabbi Yosei could have <b>said to you: That</b> term <b>is necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, <b>as it is taught:</b> The verse states: <b>“For food,” but not for a poultice [<i>melogema</i>].</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: Do <b>you say “for food” but not for a poultice, or</b> perhaps <b>it is only “for food” but not for laundering? When</b> the verse <b>says: “For you,” laundering is</b> already <b>stated</b> as permitted since it includes all of one’s bodily needs. <b>How do I realize</b> the meaning of that which the verse states: <b>“For food”?</b> It is <b>“for food” but not for a poultice.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues. Should one ask: <b>And what did you see</b> that led you <b>to include the</b> use of Sabbatical Year produce for <b>laundering and to exclude the</b> use of Sabbatical Year produce as <b>a poultice?</b> Perhaps the opposite should be said. The <i>baraita</i> answers: <b>I include the</b> use for <b>laundering, which</b> applies <b>equally to every person,</b> as everyone needs clean clothes, <b>and I exclude the</b> use as <b>a poultice, which</b> does <b>not</b> apply <b>equally to every person;</b> it is only for the ill wounded.
<b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to Sabbatical Year produce: <b>“For food,” but not for a poultice; “for food,” but not for sprinkling</b> wine in one’s house to provide a pleasant fragrance; <b>“for food,” but not to make an emetic [<i>apiktevizin</i>] from it</b> to induce vomiting? <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this <i>baraita</i>? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as, if</b> it were <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, is there</b> not <b>also soaking and laundering</b> that should have been excluded from the <i>baraita</i>, as in the Rabbis’ opinion the use of Sabbatical Year produce for those purposes is forbidden?
§ The mishna (100b) teaches that if the owner gave wool to a dyer to dye it red and instead he dyed it black, Rabbi Meir says: The dyer gives the owner of the wool the value of his wool. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the value of <b>the enhancement</b> exceeds the dyer’s expenses, the owner of the wool gives the dyer the expenses. If the expenses exceed the enhancement, he gives him the value of the enhancement. The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> device, the acrostic <b><i>saban</i>,</b> for the names of the Sages involved in the following incident; each letter in the acrostic represents the middle letter of one of the names: <i>Samekh</i>, Rav Yosef; <i>beit</i>, Rabbi Abba; <i>nun</i>, Rav Huna.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yosef was sitting behind Rabbi Abba,</b> and they were both sitting <b>before Rav Huna. And Rav Huna was sitting and saying:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa and</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef turned his face</b> in disdain of Rav Huna’s statement. <b>He said: Granted,</b> stating that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa is necessary,</b> as it would <b>enter your mind to say</b> that there is a principle that when there is a dispute between <b>an individual and</b> the <b>many,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the many.</b> Rav Huna therefore <b>teaches us</b> that in this case the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa, despite the fact that he is <b>an individual.</b>
The Gemara interrupts Rav Yosef’s remark and asks: <b>What is</b> the ruling of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa</b> to which Rav Huna is referring? It is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says</b> that with regard to <b>a loan with</b> a promissory <b>note, one may not collect</b> the loan <b>from</b> gentiles near the time of their holidays, but with regard to <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement, <b>one may collect from</b> gentiles even near the time of their holidays, <b>because</b> the creditor is considered <b>as one who salvages</b> money <b>from their possession.</b>
<b>But</b> with regard to the statement that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, why do I</b> need it? This <b>is</b> an example of the Mishna recording <b>a dispute, and afterward</b> recording only one side of that dispute as <b>an unattributed opinion. And</b> the principle is that when the Mishna records <b>a dispute, and afterward</b> records only one side of that dispute as <b>an unattributed opinion,</b> then the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the unattributed opinion.</b>
The Gemara identifies the dispute and the unattributed mishna. The <b>dispute</b> is found <b>in</b> tractate <b><i>Bava Kamma</i>:</b> If one gave wool to a dyer <b>to dye</b> it <b>red for him and</b> instead <b>he dyed it black,</b> or to dye it <b>black and he dyed it red, Rabbi Meir says:</b> The dyer <b>gives</b> the owner of the wool <b>the value of his wool. Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the value of <b>the enhancement exceeds the expenses,</b> the owner of the wool <b>gives the expenses to</b> the dyer. <b>And if the expenses exceed the enhancement, he gives him</b> the value of <b>the enhancement. And the unattributed</b> mishna appears <b>in</b> tractate <b><i>Bava Metzia</i>, as we learned</b> in a mishna there (76a): <b>Whoever changes</b> from the terms of an agreement <b>is at a disadvantage, and whoever reneges from</b> an agreement <b>is at a disadvantage.</b> This unattributed mishna accords with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who holds that a craftsman who deviates from his assignment receives either the expenses or the enhancement, whichever is of lesser value.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> being that this is a dispute and afterward an unattributed opinion, why did <b>Rav Huna</b> find it necessary to state that the <i>halakha</i> follows the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda? <b>It is necessary,</b> as it would <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>the Mishna is not sequential and,</b> in fact, this <b>is</b> a case of <b>an unattributed</b> ruling <b>followed by a dispute. And</b> why does <b>Rav Yosef</b> disagree? He disagrees because <b>if that is so,</b> then with regard to <b>every</b> case where <b>a dispute</b> is recorded <b>and afterward an unattributed</b> opinion is recorded, <b>let us say: The Mishna is not sequential, and</b> this <b>is</b> a case of <b>an unattributed</b> ruling <b>followed by a dispute.</b>
<b>And Rav Huna</b> would respond: The situation <b>where we do not say</b> that <b>the Mishna is not sequential,</b> i.e., where we say that the Mishna is sequential, is only when both <i>mishnayot</i> appear <b>in one tractate, but</b> when they appear <b>in two</b> different <b>tractates we say</b> that the Mishna is not sequential. Since these <i>mishnayot</i> are found in two different tractates, <i>Bava Kamma</i> and <i>Bava Metzia</i>, the assumption is that the Mishna is not sequential. <b>And Rav Yosef</b> would respond: <b>All of <i>Nezikin</i>,</b> i.e., <i>Bava Kamma</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i>, and <i>Bava Batra</i>, <b>is one tractate.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> that even if <i>Bava Kamma</i> and <i>Bava Metzia</i> are to be considered two separate tractates, Rav Yosef would still hold that Rav Huna’s statement was unnecessary <b>because</b> it <b>is taught</b> as one of a pair <b>of established <i>halakhot</i>: Whoever changes</b> from the terms of an agreement <b>is at a disadvantage, and whoever reneges</b> on an agreement <b>is at a disadvantage.</b> Since this ruling was taught with another, established <i>halakha</i>, it is apparent that this is also an established <i>halakha</i>.
§ The Gemara notes another dispute concerning one who deviates from the terms of an agreement. <b>The Sages taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 4:20): <b>One who gives money to his agent</b>

Daf 102b

<b>to purchase wheat for him,</b> which he plans to sell at a profit, <b>and</b> instead the agent <b>purchased barley with</b> the money, or if he gave his agent money to purchase <b>barley and</b> instead <b>he purchased wheat with</b> the money, two <i>baraitot</i> issue discordant rulings with regard to the <i>halakha</i>. <b>It is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>if there was a loss, the loss is for</b> the agent, <b>and if there was a profit,</b> the <b>profit is for</b> the agent as well, as he is considered to have abrogated his status as an agent by deviating from the instructions. <b>And it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 4:20) that if there was an agreement that both parties would split the profits from the transaction, <b>if there was a loss, the loss is for</b> the agent, <b>and if there was a profit,</b> the <b>profit</b> goes <b>to the middle,</b> i.e., the agent and the investor split the profit.
To reconcile the <i>baraitot</i>, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> first <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and this</b> second <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
Rabbi Yoḥanan explains his rationale: <b>This</b> first <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>a change</b> by an agent that deviates from the terms of his assignment means that the agent <b>acquires</b> the item in question for himself, as in the case of one who was paid to dye wool red but dyed it black. In this case as well, when the agent purchases wheat instead of barley, or vice versa, he acquires the grain for himself. <b>And this</b> second <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>a change</b> by an agent which deviates from the terms of his assignment does <b>not</b> mean that the agent <b>acquires</b> the item in question for himself. It is acquired by the one who appointed the agent, and they split the profits as agreed. But the agent is held responsible for any loss incurred, due to his deviation from the instructions.
<b>Rabbi Elazar objects to this</b> explanation: <b>From where</b> do you say that the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda extends to the case of these <i>baraitot</i>? <b>Perhaps Rabbi Meir says</b> that a change by an agent from the terms of his assignment results in the acquisition of the item by the agent <b>only with regard to an item that is fit for</b> use by the one who appointed the agent <b>himself,</b> such as wool dyed the wrong color, which is now not usable for its intended purpose. <b>But</b> Rabbi Meir <b>does not say</b> his ruling with regard to an item purchased <b>for</b> subsequent sale as <b>merchandise,</b> since it is intended to be sold for a profit in any event, and the transaction would take effect as agreed upon initially, with the agent held responsible for any loss incurred.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Elazar said:</b> Both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are written in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, and</b> it is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, it is discussing grain purchased <b>for eating,</b> and since the one who appointed the agent desired wheat, he does not acquire the barley. <b>There,</b> in the second <i>baraita</i>, it is discussing grain purchased <b>for</b> subsequent sale as <b>merchandise,</b> and the transaction takes effect as agreed upon initially, with the agent held responsible for any loss incurred.
The Gemara notes that <b>they laughed at it in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, at the explanation <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> who said that <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> a deviation by an agent from the terms of his assignment does not result in the acquisition of the item for the agent himself: <b>And who informed the owner of the wheat,</b> i.e., the seller, <b>that he should transfer the wheat to the owner of the money?</b> If the seller was unaware that the agent was acting on someone else’s behalf, how would the one who appointed the agent acquire the wheat? <b>Rav Shmuel bar Sasrati objects to this</b> rationale: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even</b> in a case where the agent was sent to purchase <b>wheat and</b> he purchased <b>wheat,</b> the one who appointed the agent should <b>not</b> acquire the wheat, since the seller was unaware that the agent was acting on someone else’s behalf.
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said:</b> The case of an agent who was assigned to purchase <b>wheat and</b> purchased <b>wheat is different, as</b> the agent <b>is performing his assignment and,</b> as such, <b>he is like the customer,</b> i.e., the one who appointed him, and it is as though the latter has purchased the grain himself.
Rabbi Abbahu further explains: <b>Know</b> that the agent is viewed as an extension of the one who appointed him, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 24a): Concerning both <b>one who consecrates his property and one who valuates himself</b> by donating his fixed value to the Temple, the Temple treasury <b>does not have</b> any rights <b>with regard to</b> the donor’s <b>wife’s clothing; and not with regard to his children’s clothing; and not with regard to</b> new clothes colored with <b>dye that the</b> donor <b>dyed for</b> his wife or children; <b>and not with regard to new sandals that</b> the donor <b>purchased for</b> his wife or children. Presumably, the treasurer has no right to these items because they are for the personal use of the donor’s wife and children, and are considered as if owned by them.
Rabbi Abbahu continues: <b>And why</b> is it so, i.e., why is it that the wife is considered the owner of the dyed clothing for which the husband paid? <b>Here also, let</b> us <b>say: Who informed the dyer that he should transfer his dye to the wife? Rather, is it not because we say that</b> the husband <b>is performing his assignment and,</b> as such, he is <b>like</b> an extension of <b>his wife’s hand? Here also,</b> in the case of one who purchases grain for another, the agent <b>is performing his assignment, and is like</b> an extension of the <b>customer’s hand.</b>
The Gemara rejects this explanation. <b>Rabbi Abba said: No,</b> the reason for the ruling of the mishna is that <b>the intention of anyone who consecrates his property is not upon the clothing of his wife and his children,</b> i.e., he does not intend to consecrate those items.
<b>Rabbi Zeira objects to</b> Rabbi Abba’s explanation: <b>And is it the intention of a person</b> who consecrates his property to do so <b>upon his phylacteries?</b> Presumably not. <b>And we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 23b) that with regard to <b>one who consecrates</b> all of <b>his property,</b> his <b>phylacteries are evaluated for him</b> and consecrated. Apparently, lack of intent to consecrate a particular item does not prevent its consecration. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rabbi Zeira: <b>Yes, the intention of a person</b> who consecrates his property <b>is upon</b> his <b>phylacteries,</b> because <b>one who consecrates his property thinks</b> to himself: <b>I am performing a mitzva,</b> and he therefore intends to include his phylacteries; <b>but the intention of a person is not upon the clothing of his wife and his children, due to the enmity</b> that would be engendered if he consecrated their clothing.
<b>Rav Oshaya</b> also <b>objects to</b> Rabbi Abba’s explanation: <b>But is it not</b> so that the matter of <b>those who are obligated in valuations was taught here</b> in the mishna, <b>and we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 21a): Concerning <b>those who are obligated in valuations,</b> the Temple treasury <b>seizes collateral from them</b> to force them to fulfill their vow.
<b>And is the intention of a person upon himself</b> to allow the treasurer <b>to seize collateral from him?</b> Presumably not. Nevertheless, collateral is seized from him, proving that one’s intention does not prevent consecration. Accordingly, even if it is assumed that he does not intend to consecrate the clothing of his wife or children, the clothing should nevertheless be consecrated. Why, then, is the clothing of his wife or children not consecrated?
<b>Rather, Rabbi Abba</b> also holds that the reason the clothing is not consecrated is not due to his intent, and he <b>said</b> a different explanation: <b>Anyone who consecrates his property becomes as one who transferred his wife’s and his children’s clothing to them at the outset.</b> Therefore, the clothing did not belong to him at the time that he consecrated his property.
§ The Gemara presents another situation in which one makes a purchase involving a third party. <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the case of <b>one who purchases a field in the name of another, he is not compelled to sell</b> it. <b>But if he said to him</b> at the time of the sale: I will purchase the field <b>on the condition</b> that he will sell it to me, <b>he is compelled to sell</b> it.
Noting the ambiguity of this statement, the Gemara asks: <b>What is it saying? Rav Sheshet said</b> that <b>this</b> is what it <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>one who purchases a field from another,</b> claiming that he is acting <b>in the name of the Exilarch</b> or another dominant figure, so that others will be discouraged from contesting the sale, <b>the Exilarch is not compelled to sell</b> it to him, i.e., the Exilarch is not required to provide the purchaser with documentation that the field belongs to the purchaser. <b>But if</b> the purchaser <b>said</b> to the seller: I will purchase the field <b>on the condition</b> that the Exilarch will provide me with that documentation, <b>the Exilarch is compelled to sell</b> it to him, i.e., to provide him with the documentation.
The Gemara questions Rav Sheshet’s interpretation. <b>The Master said:</b> With regard to <b>one who purchases a field in the name of the Exilarch, the Exilarch is not compelled to sell</b> it to him. Since the <i>baraita</i> teaches only that the Exilarch is not required to provide the purchaser with documentation that the field is his, it can be understood <b>by inference that</b> the purchaser <b>has</b> nevertheless <b>acquired</b> the field <b>for himself. Let us say that</b> this interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> <b>disagrees with</b> the statement of <b>the residents of the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>who say: And who informed the owner of the wheat that he should transfer the wheat to the customer?</b> Since the seller assumed he was selling the field to the Exilarch, the Sages of Eretz Yisrael would hold that the sale does not take effect.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>If</b> it is <b>due to this</b> inference that it is surmised that the <i>baraita</i> is in conflict with the opinion of the Sages of Eretz Yisrael, it is <b>not difficult,</b> as it can be said that the <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where</b> the purchaser <b>informed the owner of the field and informed the witnesses</b> that he intends to purchase the field for himself.
The Gemara rejects Rav Sheshet’s interpretation for a different reason. <b>Rather, say</b> that <b>the latter clause</b> is difficult, as it states that if the purchaser said to the seller: I will purchase the field <b>on the condition</b> that the Exilarch will sell it to me, <b>the Exilarch is compelled to sell</b> it to him. <b>Why</b> should the Exilarch be compelled to provide the purchaser with documentation? <b>But let the Exilarch say: I do not desire your esteem nor do I desire your disgrace,</b> i.e., I am not involved in your affairs. Since the Exilarch had not been party to the negotiations, how can a stipulation stated by the purchaser render him obligated?
<b>Rather, Abaye said: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>one who purchases a field in the name of his friend, the Exilarch,</b>

Daf 103a

<b>the seller is not compelled to sell</b> the field <b>another time,</b> i.e., to provide the purchaser with a document denoting him as the owner of the field. <b>But if he said to him:</b> I will purchase the field <b>on the condition</b> that you will provide a deed in my name, <b>the seller is compelled to sell</b> the field again, i.e., to provide the purchaser with a document denoting him as the owner.
The Gemara clarifies the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said:</b> In the case of <b>one who purchases a field in the name of another, the seller is not compelled to sell</b> the field <b>another time.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Isn’t</b> this <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that the purchaser <b>can say to</b> the seller: <b>You knew that I took,</b> i.e., purchased, the field <b>for myself, and it was merely</b> for <b>protection [<i>ufanaḥya</i>] that I desired</b> to obtain ownership by claiming to purchase it in the name of the other person, <b>and I do not throw</b> out <b>money for naught. Rather,</b> it was <b>with the intention that you will write another document for him,</b> i.e., the seller, stating that I purchased the field. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us that</b> the seller can <b>say to him: I have performed a matter for you together with the one in whose name you purchased</b> the field, <b>and let him write you another document.</b>
The Gemara discusses Abaye’s interpretation of the latter clause of the <i>baraita</i>, which states: <b>But if he said to him:</b> I will purchase the field <b>on the condition</b> that you will provide a deed in my name, <b>the seller is compelled to sell</b> the field again. Isn’t that <b>obvious? No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the purchaser <b>said to the witnesses in front of</b> the seller: You can <b>see that I require another document. Lest you say</b> that the seller <b>can say to him: I thought</b> that it was <b>a document from the one in whose name you purchased</b> the field that <b>you were saying</b> you required, and not from me. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> the purchaser can <b>say to him:</b> It was <b>for this</b> that <b>I took the trouble and said to the witnesses, in front of you,</b> that I require another document, <b>as it is from you that I require</b> the document.
§ The Gemara mentions a related incident: <b>Rav Kahana gave money</b> to a salesman in exchange <b>for flax,</b> and temporarily left the flax in the possession of the seller. <b>Ultimately,</b> the <b>flax appreciated</b> in value and the <b>owner of the flax sold it</b> for a greater profit on behalf of Rav Kahana, intending to give him all of the money. Rav Kahana then <b>came before Rav,</b> and <b>said to him: What should I do? Should I go and take my money,</b> or would doing so have the appearance of collecting interest for a loan? Rav <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>If, when they sold</b> the flax, <b>they said: This flax is Kahana’s, go take</b> the money, as in such a case it is as though the flax was purchased directly from you. <b>But if</b> they did <b>not</b> say this, <b>do not take</b> the money, since you would be receiving a greater sum of money than you provided, and this would appear to be a loan repaid with interest.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion was Rav’s ruling? Was it only <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the people of the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>who say: Who informed the owner of the wheat that he should transfer the wheat to the owner of the money?</b> As the Gemara taught earlier, the Sages of Eretz Yisrael hold that the sale can be performed on another’s behalf only if such an arrangement is explicitly stated at the time of the transaction. In this case as well, if the seller did not explicitly state that the money would belong to Rav Kahana, all the money from the sale would be acquired by the seller, who would then be prohibited to give it to Rav Kahana due to the appearance of paying interest.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Is that to say that Rav Kahana gave four</b> dinars <b>and took eight</b> in return? He did not lend money to the seller. Rather, <b>the flax appreciated</b> in value <b>by itself,</b> and when the seller sold it <b>he robbed</b> Rav Kahana of his flax, <b>and we learned</b> in a mishna (93b) that <b>all robbers pay</b> compensation <b>according to</b> the value of the stolen item at <b>the time of the robbery.</b> Therefore, according to all opinions the seller owes Rav Kahana the value of the flax at the time the seller sold it for its appreciated value, and Rav Kahana’s accepting the money would not constitute collecting interest for a loan.
Having rejected the previous explanation of Rav’s ruling, the Gemara presents an alternative understanding of the case. The Sages <b>say: There, it was</b> a matter of <b>trust,</b> as the seller was paid in advance <b>and Rav Kahana did not pull the flax</b> as an act of acquisition, or perform any other formal act of acquisition. Consequently, at the time of the second sale the flax belonged to the seller. <b>And Rav</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rav says: One may make</b> an arrangement of <b>trust with regard to</b> the delivery of items such as <b>produce,</b> i.e., one may pay the money in advance with the agreement that he will receive the produce at a later date, <b>but one may not make</b> an arrangement of <b>trust with regard to money,</b> i.e., one may not pay the money in advance with the agreement that he will receive the value of the produce at a later date, as this has the appearance of collecting interest.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who robs another</b> of an item having <b>the value of</b> at least <b>one <i>peruta</i> and takes</b> a false <b>oath to</b> the robbery victim claiming his innocence, and then later wishes to repent, must <b>bring</b> the money, which includes the principal together with an additional one-fifth payment, to the robbery victim, even if this necessitates following <b>after him to</b> a distant place like <b>Medea.</b> The robber <b>may not give</b> the payment <b>to</b> the robbery victim’s <b>son</b> to return it to the robbery victim, <b>and neither</b> may he give it <b>to his agent, but he may give</b> the payment <b>to an agent of the court. And if</b> the robbery victim <b>dies, he returns it to his heirs.</b>
If <b>he gave</b> the robbery victim <b>the principal</b> value of the stolen item <b>but did not give him</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, or if the owner <b>forgave him concerning the principal but did not forgive him concerning</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, or if <b>he forgave him concerning this and concerning that, with the exception of the value of less than one <i>peruta</i> of the principal, he need not pursue him</b> to repay the remaining debt. By contrast, if <b>he gave</b> the robbery victim the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>but did not give him the principal,</b> or if the robbery victim <b>forgave him concerning</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>but did not forgive him concerning the principal,</b> or if <b>he forgave him concerning this and concerning that, with the exception of the value of one <i>peruta</i> of the principal, he must pursue him</b> to repay the remaining debt.
If the robber <b>gave</b> the robbery victim <b>the principal and took</b> a false <b>oath to him concerning</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, asserting that he had already paid it,

Daf 103b

then the additional one-fifth is considered a new principal obligation. The robber <b>pays</b> an additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>apart from</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment about which he had taken a false oath. If he then takes a false oath concerning the second one-fifth payment, he is assessed an additional one-fifth payment for that oath, <b>until the principal,</b> i.e., the additional one-fifth payment about which he has most recently taken the false oath, <b>is reduced to less than the value of one <i>peruta</i>.</b>
<b>And such</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a deposit, as it is stated:</b> “If anyone sins, and commits a trespass against the Lord, and he defrauds his counterpart <b>with regard to a deposit, or with regard to a pledge, or with regard to a robbery, or if he exploited his counterpart; or he has found that which was lost, and deals falsely with it, and swears to a lie</b>…he shall restore it in full, and shall add the fifth part more to it” (Leviticus 5:21–24). <b>This</b> one must <b>pay</b> the <b>principal and</b> an additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if a robber took a false oath that he did not rob, he must travel even as far as Medea in order to repay the robbery victim. This indicates that if <b>he takes an oath to</b> the robbery victim, <b>yes,</b> he is required to go to any length to repay his obligation, but if he <b>did not take an oath to him, no,</b> he does not have to do so. <b>Whose</b> opinion is this? It is <b>not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon and not</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 118b): If one <b>robbed one of five</b> people <b>and he does not know which of them</b> he robbed, <b>and each one</b> of the five <b>says: He robbed me,</b> the robber <b>places</b> the <b>stolen item between them and withdraws</b> from them; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Tarfon. Rabbi Akiva says: This is not</b> the <b>way to spare him from transgression.</b> He is not considered to have returned the stolen item <b>until he pays</b> the value of the <b>stolen item to each and every one</b> of the five.
The Gemara clarifies: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the mishna written? <b>If</b> one suggests that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon,</b> it is not so, because <b>even though</b> the robber <b>took</b> a false <b>oath</b> that he did not rob, Rabbi Tarfon <b>says: He places</b> the <b>stolen item between them and withdraws;</b> it is not his responsibility to ensure that it reaches the robbery victim. <b>If</b> one suggests that it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> it is also not so, because <b>even though</b> the robber <b>did not</b> necessarily <b>take</b> a false <b>oath,</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>says:</b> He is not considered to have returned the stolen item <b>until he pays</b> the value of the <b>stolen item to each and every one</b> of the five, while the mishna rules that his obligation is contingent upon his having taken the false oath.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually, it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, and when Rabbi Akiva says</b> that the robber is not considered to have returned the stolen item <b>until he pays</b> the value of the <b>stolen item to each and every one</b> of the five, it is only in a case <b>where</b> the robber <b>took</b> a false <b>oath that</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>says</b> this. <b>What is the reason? As the verse states</b> with regard to one who takes a false oath concerning a financial obligation: <b>“Unto him to whom it appertains shall he give it, on the day of his being guilty”</b> (Leviticus 5:24). The <i>halakha</i> that the guilty party must make a rigorous effort to return what he owes is stated in the case of one who took a false oath, and Rabbi Akiva would state his ruling only in that case.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>Rabbi Tarfon</b> rule that a robber who took a false oath is not required to pay all claimants, being that the verse indicates otherwise? The Gemara answers: <b>Even though he took</b> a false <b>oath</b> and by Torah law is obligated to return the stolen item to the robbery victim, <b>the Sages instituted an ordinance</b> allowing him to place it between the five possible victims, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says:</b> The Sages <b>instituted a great ordinance</b> stating <b>that if the expense</b> required to return a stolen item to the victim <b>is greater than the principal,</b> the robber may <b>pay the principal and</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>to the court, and</b> he then <b>brings his guilt-offering and achieves atonement for himself.</b> This ordinance would apply here as well, as the expense required to pay all five claimants is greater than the principal.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> doesn’t <b>Rabbi Akiva</b> agree that the Sages instituted this ordinance? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Akiva holds that <b>when the Sages instituted the ordinance,</b> they did so only for cases <b>where</b> the robber <b>knows whom he robbed, as</b> in such cases <b>he is</b> definitely <b>returning the money to its owner</b> by depositing it with the court, who will convey it to the robbery victim. But in the case of one who <b>robbed one of five</b> people, <b>where he does not know whom he robbed,</b> and <b>where,</b> by merely placing the stolen item between the five of them <b>the money is not returned to its owner, the Sages did not institute an ordinance.</b>
<b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda raises an objection</b> to the explanation that Rabbi Akiva stated his opinion specifically in a case where the robber took an oath. The <i>baraita</i> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (<i>Yevamot</i> 14:2) states that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says: Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva did not disagree with regard to one who purchased</b> an item <b>from</b> one of <b>five</b> people <b>and does not know from which of them he purchased</b> it, as both agree <b>that</b> in this case <b>he places the money of the purchase between them and withdraws.</b> Since the purchaser has not transgressed, he is not penalized by being required to suffer the loss of paying each of them. <b>With regard to what did they disagree?</b> They disagree with regard to one <b>who robbed one of five people, and he does not know from which of them he robbed</b> the item, <b>as Rabbi Tarfon says: He places the stolen item between them and withdraws, and Rabbi Akiva says: He has no remedy,</b> i.e., he has not fulfilled his obligation to return the stolen item, <b>until he pays</b> the value of <b>the stolen item to each and every one</b> of them.
Rav Huna bar Yehuda states his objection: <b>And if it enters your mind that</b> Rabbi Akiva stated his ruling specifically <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>took</b> a false <b>oath, what</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> if he <b>purchased</b> an item from another, and <b>what</b> is the difference <b>to me</b> if he <b>robbed</b> him? In either case he has transgressed the prohibition against taking a false oath denying his obligation, and he should be penalized by being required to ensure that the one to whom he owes the money receives it.
<b>And Rava raises another objection</b> to the explanation that Rabbi Akiva stated his opinion specifically in a case where the robber took an oath. There was <b>an incident involving a certain pious</b> man <b>who purchased</b> an item <b>from</b> one of <b>two people, and he did not know from which of them he purchased</b> the item, <b>and he came before Rabbi Tarfon</b> for a ruling. Rabbi Tarfon <b>said to him: Place the money of your purchase between them and withdraw. He</b> then <b>came before Rabbi Akiva,</b> who <b>said to him: You have no remedy until you pay each and every one,</b> i.e., both of them. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that Rabbi Akiva stated his ruling specifically <b>where</b> the purchaser <b>took</b> a false <b>oath, does a pious</b> man <b>take a false oath?</b> It seems from this incident that Rabbi Akiva rules he must pay all potential owners regardless of whether or not he took a false oath.
<b>And if you would say that</b> perhaps <b>he took</b> a false <b>oath and later became a pious</b> man, <b>but</b> isn’t there a tradition that <b>anywhere that we say:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a certain pious</b> man, the pious man is <b>either Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava or Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Elai, and Rabbi Yehuda ben Bava and Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Elai, were</b> both <b>pious</b> men <b>from the beginning.</b>
Due to these objections, the Gemara offers an alternative explanation. <b>Rather,</b> the mishna here <b>is actually</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon, and Rabbi Tarfon concedes</b> that a robber must pay every potential owner in a case <b>where he took</b> a false <b>oath,</b> as is the case in the mishna here. <b>What is the reason? As the verse states: “Unto him to whom it appertains shall he give it, in the day of his being guilty”</b> (Leviticus 5:24). This verse, which requires one to go to any length to return money owed, is referring specifically to one who takes a false oath concerning his financial obligation. <b>And Rabbi Akiva, who said</b> in the mishna in tractate <i>Yevamot</i> that a robber must pay all potential owners <b>even though he did not take</b> a false <b>oath,</b> agrees that the verse is referring specifically to one who takes a false oath, but holds that the Sages <b>penalize</b> the robber by obligating him to pay them all in any event.
The Gemara questions this explanation of the mishna: <b>But</b> if the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Tarfon, after all,</b> the mere fact that it is a case <b>where he took</b> a false <b>oath is not sufficient</b> to obligate him to pay the additional one-fifth and to bring a guilt-offering if it is a case <b>where he did not</b> also <b>admit</b> that he took a false oath and owes the money. Therefore, <b>why</b> would the mishna here <b>specifically</b> state: <b>And he took</b> a false <b>oath? Even without</b> taking the false <b>oath,</b> the robber should <b>also</b> be obligated to pursue the owner as a result of his having admitted his obligation. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Tarfon concedes</b> that <b>in</b> a case where a robber <b>says to two</b> people: <b>I robbed one of you</b> of <b>one hundred dinars and I do not know which of you</b> it was, <b>he gives one hundred dinars to this</b> person <b>and one hundred dinars to that</b> person,

Daf 104a

<b>as he has already admitted</b> his obligation <b>on his own.</b> Rabbi Tarfon concedes that a robber who wishes to repent must go to any length to return the stolen item to its owner. If the mishna here is in accordance with his opinion, it should not have stated its ruling specifically in a case where the robber took a false oath.
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The case of <b>the mishna is different,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> stated here could be in accordance with the opinions of both Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva. <b>For as</b> the robber <b>knows whom he robbed and admitted to him</b> that he robbed him, <b>since it is possible to return the money to its owner,</b> the robbery victim <b>is as the one who says to</b> the robber: The money you owe me <b>will be</b> kept <b>in your possession</b> as a deposit <b>for me. Therefore,</b> in a case where the robber <b>took</b> a false <b>oath, even though</b> the owner is considered to have <b>said to him:</b> The money you owe me <b>will be</b> kept <b>in your possession</b> as a deposit <b>for me, since</b> the robber <b>requires atonement</b> for his false oath, <b>it is not possible</b> for him to achieve atonement <b>until</b> the money <b>reaches the possession of</b> the robbery victim. <b>But</b> in a case where the robber <b>did not take</b> a false <b>oath,</b> the money <b>is</b> considered as a <b>deposit</b> given <b>to</b> the robber <b>until</b> the owner <b>comes and takes it.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that if the robber wishes to return the stolen item, he <b>may not give</b> the payment <b>to</b> the robbery victim’s <b>son</b> to return it to the robbery victim, <b>nor to his agent.</b> The Gemara comments: It <b>was stated</b> with regard to <b>an agent who was appointed in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses</b> to collect a debt from another: <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> Such an agent <b>is</b> a legally recognized <b>agent,</b> so that the debtor is considered to have repaid his debt as soon as he transfers the money to the agent, and the debtor will not be held responsible if an accident occurs causing the loss of the money before the agent gives it to the creditor. <b>Rabba said:</b> Such an agent <b>is not</b> a legally recognized <b>agent,</b> and the debtor remains responsible until the money reaches the creditor’s possession.
The Gemara explains their respective opinions: <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> that he <b>is an agent</b> because it was <b>for this</b> reason that the creditor <b>took the trouble and appointed</b> the agent <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses, in order to place</b> the matter <b>under</b> the agent’s <b>domain. Rabba said</b> that he <b>is not an agent</b> because <b>this is</b> what the creditor <b>is</b> assumed to be <b>saying</b> to the debtor: This individual <b>is a trustworthy person. If you</b> are willing to <b>rely</b> on him, then <b>rely</b> on him to convey the payment to me. Similarly: <b>If you wish to send</b> the debt <b>in his possession,</b> then <b>send</b> it <b>in his possession.</b>
The Gemara cites a mishna that poses a difficulty to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 98b): With regard to <b>one who</b> enters into an agreement to <b>borrow a cow</b> from another, <b>and</b> the owner <b>sent it</b> to the borrower <b>in the possession of his</b> own <b>son,</b> or <b>in the possession of his</b> own <b>slave,</b> or <b>in the possession of his</b> own <b>agent, or</b> if he sent it <b>in the possession of the borrower’s son,</b> or <b>in the possession of</b> the borrower’s <b>slave,</b> or <b>in the possession of</b> the borrower’s <b>agent, and</b> the cow <b>died,</b> the borrower is <b>exempt</b> from paying for the cow, as it never entered his possession.
The Gemara explains the case of the mishna: With regard to <b>this agent of</b> the borrower, <b>what are the circumstances</b> surrounding his appointment? <b>If</b> the mishna is discussing a case <b>where he did not appoint</b> him as his agent <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses, how do we know</b> that he was appointed as an agent? <b>Rather,</b> it must be that it is a case <b>where he appointed</b> him as his agent <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses, and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches that</b> the borrower is <b>exempt.</b> This poses <b>a difficulty to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who holds that one acquires property through his agent. According to his reasoning, the borrower should be held responsible for the cow once it reaches the possession of the agent.
The Gemara answers: It is <b>as that</b> which <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> concerning a different mishna: This is stated <b>with regard to his hired</b> hand <b>or his</b> regular <b>harvester; here also</b> the mishna in <i>Bava Metzia</i> is <b>with regard to his hired</b> hand <b>or his</b> regular <b>harvester.</b> The mishna discusses a case where there were no witnesses to the appointment of the agent, and therefore it does not pose a difficulty to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda. Yet, since it is well known that this person is constantly in the owner’s service, he is assumed to be acting as his agent.
The Gemara poses a difficulty to the opinion of Rav Ḥisda from the mishna here. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: If the robber wishes to return the stolen item, he <b>may not give</b> the payment <b>to</b> the robbery victim’s <b>son</b> to return it to the robbery victim, <b>nor to his agent.</b> With regard to <b>this agent of</b> the robbery victim, <b>what are the circumstances</b> surrounding his appointment? <b>If</b> the mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the robbery victim <b>did not appoint him</b> as his agent <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses, how do we know</b> that he was appointed as an agent? <b>Rather, is it not</b> discussing a case <b>where</b> the robbery victim <b>appointed him</b> as his agent <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> and the robber nevertheless does not fulfill his obligation to return the stolen item by giving it to this agent? The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Ḥisda interpreted</b> the ruling of the mishna <b>with regard to his hired</b> hand <b>or his</b> regular <b>harvester,</b> who do not require witnesses to validate their appointment as his agent.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>an agent who</b> the robbery victim <b>appointed in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Would one say that <b>indeed,</b> one appointed before witnesses <b>is</b> a legally recognized <b>agent?</b> If that is the case, <b>instead of teaching</b> in <b>the latter clause: But he may give</b> the payment <b>to an agent of the court,</b> which indicates that this is the only agent to whom he may give it, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>make a distinction within</b> the case of an agent appointed by the robbery victim <b>itself and teach: An agent who</b> the robbery victim <b>appointed in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses is indeed</b> a legally recognized <b>agent.</b> If an agent appointed in the presence of witnesses is a legally recognized agent, why does the mishna shift to discuss an agent of the court?
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: Although the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna could have stated the case of an agent appointed by the robbery victim in the presence of witnesses, <b>he</b> could <b>not</b> have stated this <i>halakha</i> <b>definitively,</b> as with regard to <b>an agent of the court,</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether the <b>robbery victim appointed him</b> as an agent, i.e., the court appointed him at the behest of the robbery victim, <b>and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether the <b>robber appointed him</b> as an agent, i.e., the court appointed him at the behest of the robber. In both cases <b>he is</b> a legally recognized <b>agent.</b> Therefore, <b>he</b> could state the <i>halakha</i> concerning an agent of the court <b>definitively.</b> By contrast, with regard to <b>an agent who was appointed in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses, that</b> only <b>when</b> the <b>robbery victim appointed him</b> as an agent <b>he is an agent,</b> but when the <b>robber appointed him</b> as an agent, <b>he is not an agent,</b> as the robber cannot appoint an agent to receive payment on behalf of the robbery victim, <b>he</b> could <b>not</b> have stated this <i>halakha</i> <b>definitively.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this mishna, which rules that an agent of the court is an agent even if appointed only by the robber, serves <b>to exclude</b> the opinion of <b>this</b> following <b><i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in the <i>Tosefta</i> (10:11) that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If there was <b>an agent of the court who was appointed by</b> the <b>robbery victim but not appointed by</b> the <b>robber, or</b> an agent who <b>was appointed by</b> the <b>robber, and</b> subsequently <b>the other,</b> i.e., the robbery victim, <b>sent</b> for <b>and took his</b> payment <b>from</b> the agent’s <b>possession,</b> the robber is <b>exempt</b> from paying for any accidental damage to the payment during the delivery. Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar states that the robber is exempt from paying for any accidental damage when he gave the payment to a court agent he appointed only if the robbery victim sent for and took possession of the payment. This is in opposition to the ruling of the mishna that the robber is exempt whenever he gives the payment to an agent of the court.
The Gemara cites the opinion of two other <i>amora’im</i> with regard to the status of an agent appointed in the presence of witnesses. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both say: An agent who was appointed in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses is</b> a legally recognized <b>agent. And if you say: Our mishna</b> contradicts this assertion, as it rules that the stolen item is not considered returned if given to an agent of the robbery victim, this is of no concern.
The Gemara explains: The mishna does not mean to disqualify an agent appointed by the robbery victim in the presence of witnesses, but rather is referring to a case <b>where</b> the robbery victim <b>provides</b> the robber <b>with an agent</b> without appointing him in the presence of witnesses, in <b>that he says to</b> someone: <b>I have money</b> owed to me that is currently <b>with so-and-so, and he is not sending it. Present yourself to him,</b> as <b>perhaps</b> he wishes to return it but <b>cannot find a person with whom to send it.</b>
The Gemara offers a second explanation: <b>Alternatively,</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b> that the mishna is not discussing a case where he appointed the agent in the presence of witnesses, but it is still known that the agent acts on behalf of the robbery victim, as the ruling of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to the victim’s hired</b> hand <b>or his</b> regular <b>harvester.</b> That is why the robber is still liable after having given the payment to the agent.
§ The Gemara discusses another matter relating to the appointment of an agent. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b>

Daf 104b

One who owes a debt <b>may not send money</b> with another to the creditor <b>on the basis of a figure [<i>deyokani</i>]</b> or sign used in place of a signature that is associated with the creditor. The possession of this sign on the part of the other is not sufficient proof that he has been appointed as an agent. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if witnesses</b> verifying that this is the creditor’s sign <b>are signed on it. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: If</b> there are <b>witnesses signed on it, one may send</b> the money with the other.
The Sages <b>say: According to Shmuel, what is the rectification,</b> i.e., what recourse is available to one who wishes to collect a debt without traveling to the debtor’s location? The Gemara answers: One may act <b>like that</b> course of action <b>of Rabbi Abba,</b> who <b>was owed money by Rav Yosef bar Ḥama.</b> Rabbi Abba <b>said to Rav Safra: When you come</b> back from Rabbi Yosef bar Ḥama’s locale, <b>bring</b> my money <b>to me. When</b> Rav Safra <b>went there, Rava,</b> Rav Yosef bar Ḥama’s <b>son, said to him: Did</b> Rabbi Abba <b>write you</b> a document stating: <b>I have received</b> payment, so that my father will have proof that he has absolved himself of the debt? Rav Safra <b>said to him: No.</b> Rava responded: <b>If so, first go</b> to him <b>and let him write you</b> a document stating: <b>I have received</b> payment, and then my father will pay you.
<b>Ultimately,</b> Rava <b>said to him: Even if he writes you</b> a document stating: <b>I have received</b> payment, <b>it is nothing,</b> since <b>perhaps by</b> the time <b>you arrive</b> back here, <b>Rabbi Abba will have died and the money will fall before</b> his <b>orphans</b> as an inheritance, <b>and</b> the document stating: <b>I have received</b> payment, that was written <b>by Rabbi Abba, will be nothing,</b> as the debt is no longer owed to him, but rather, to his heirs. Rav Safra <b>said to him: Rather, what is the rectification?</b> Rava replied: <b>Go,</b> and Rabbi Abba will <b>transfer to you</b> the rights to the money owed to him <b>by means of</b> acquisition of <b>land</b> from him, <b>and</b> then <b>you</b> should <b>come</b> and <b>write for us</b> a document stating: <b>I have received</b> payment. Then, we will pay you.
The Gemara notes: And this is <b>like that</b> course of action <b>of Rav Pappa,</b> who <b>was owed twelve thousand dinars</b> by a resident of <b>Bei Ḥozai,</b> and <b>he transferred</b> his claim to the money <b>to Rav Shmuel bar Abba by means of</b> the acquisition of <b>the threshold of his house. When</b> Rav Shmuel bar Abba <b>came</b> from Bei Ḥozai with the money in hand, Rav Pappa <b>went out as far as Tavakh toward him</b> in his excitement to receive the money.
§ The mishna teaches that if the robber <b>gave</b> the robbery victim <b>the principal</b> value of the stolen item, but did not give him the additional one-fifth payment required of a robber, he is not required to pursue the robbery victim in order to return the additional one-fifth payment. The Gemara comments: <b>Apparently,</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>is</b> considered <b>monetary restitution</b> rather than a fine. <b>And</b> accordingly, <b>if</b> the robber <b>died,</b> the <b>heirs</b> of the robber must <b>pay it</b> to the robbery victim.
<b>And we also learned</b> in the mishna that if the robber <b>gave</b> the robbery victim <b>the principal and takes</b> a false <b>oath</b> to him <b>concerning the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, asserting that he had already paid it, the robber <b>adds</b> an additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>apart from</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment about which he had taken a false oath. <b>Apparently,</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>is monetary restitution,</b> as one is obligated to pay an additional one-fifth for taking a false oath only with regard to monetary restitution, not with regard to fines.
<b>And this is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who robs another and takes</b> a false <b>oath to him</b> that he did not rob him, <b>and</b> then <b>dies,</b> his <b>heirs pay the principal and</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payments to the robbery victim, <b>but are exempt from</b> the obligation to bring <b>the guilt-offering.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> are <b>heirs obligated</b> to <b>pay the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>of their father,</b> indicating that <b>apparently</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>is monetary restitution, and</b> therefore the <b>heirs must pay</b> it? <b>But</b> one could <b>raise a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. After having stated that one is required to add the additional one-fifth payment only for a robbery he commits himself, and not for a robbery committed by his father, the <i>baraita</i> states: <b>I</b> would <b>still say</b> that <b>when does</b> an heir <b>not pay</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>for his father’s robbery?</b> It is only <b>when neither he nor his father took</b> a false <b>oath.</b>
But if <b>he</b> took a false oath, <b>but not his father;</b> or if <b>his father</b> took a false oath, <b>but not he;</b> or if <b>he and his father</b> both took false oaths; <b>from where</b> is the heir’s exemption derived? <b>The verse states:</b> “He shall restore the item <b>that he robbed,” and</b> “the item <b>that he has acquired through exploitation”</b> (Leviticus 5:23), <b>and</b> in this case the heir <b>did not rob and did not exploit.</b> Since the verse states the obligation to pay the additional one-fifth payment when discussing one who robbed or exploited another, and the heir has done neither, he is exempt from payment. This <i>baraita</i> states that heirs are not obligated to pay the additional one-fifth payment.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that it is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the mishna and the first <i>baraita</i>, they discuss a case <b>where</b> the robber <b>admitted</b> his obligation and therefore was required to pay the additional one-fifth payment, and this obligation is transferred to his heir; <b>there,</b> in the latter <i>baraita</i>, it discusses a case <b>where he did not admit</b> his obligation and was never required to pay the additional one-fifth payment.
The Gemara rejects this answer: <b>If</b> the latter <i>baraita</i> discusses a case where <b>he did not admit</b> his obligation, then the <i>halakha</i> would be that the heir <b>would not pay even the principal,</b> as the obligation is not known by anyone. <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>indeed</b> it is so <b>that he does not pay</b> the principal, <b>but</b> isn’t it understood <b>from</b> the fact that the <i>tanna</i> <b>searches for</b> a source to teach the heir’s exemption from only the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>that</b> it means <b>to say that he does pay the principal.</b>
The Gemara also proves that the heir must pay the principal from the continuation of the same <i>baraita</i>. <b>And further,</b> it <b>is taught</b> in that <i>baraita</i>: <b>And I</b> would <b>still say: When does</b> the heir <b>pay the principal for his father’s robbery?</b> It is only <b>when he and his father</b> both <b>took</b> false <b>oaths.</b> But if <b>his father</b> took a false oath, <b>and not he;</b> or if <b>he</b> took a false oath, <b>but not his father;</b> or if <b>neither he nor his father</b> took false oaths; <b>from where</b> is the heir’s obligation to pay the principal derived? <b>The verse states</b> the following terms: <b>“Robbery,” and “exploitation,” “lost item,” and “deposit”</b> (Leviticus 5:23); and <b>there is a derivation [<i>yesh talmud</i>]</b> here to derive that the heir is obligated to pay the principal in all of these cases.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>And Rav Huna sat and stated this <i>halakha</i>,</b> and <b>Rabba, his son, said to him:</b> Was <b>the Master saying</b> that <b>there is a derivation [<i>yesh talmud</i>], or</b> was <b>the Master saying</b> that <b>they will be paid [<i>yishtalmu</i>]?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: I am saying: There is a derivation, and</b> it is <b>from the additional</b> expressions in the <b>verses</b> that <b>I say</b> it can be derived. It is apparent that an heir is obligated to pay the principal, and this refutes Rav Naḥman’s attempted resolution.
<b>Rather, what</b> did Rav Naḥman mean when he suggested that the second <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where <b>he did not admit</b> his obligation and exempts his heir from paying the additional one-fifth but obligates him to pay the principal? The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the <b>father did not admit, but his son did admit,</b> and therefore he is obligated to pay the principal.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> let <b>his son be liable</b> to pay the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>for his own</b> false <b>oath.</b> The Sages <b>say: In</b> the case of the <i>baraita</i>, it is <b>where</b> the <b>stolen item is no</b> longer <b>extant.</b> Although the false oath was taken, it is not the type of obligation for which one must pay an additional one-fifth payment. The Gemara asks: <b>If in</b> the case of the <i>baraita</i> it is <b>where</b> the <b>stolen item is no</b> longer <b>extant,</b> the <i>halakha</i> should be that the heir <b>does not pay even</b> the <b>principal,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is that while heirs must return an item stolen by their father, they are not obligated to compensate the owner if the item is no longer extant. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the ruling <b>is necessary</b> in a case <b>where there is guaranteed</b> property, i.e., land, which the heirs inherited from the robber. Heirs are obligated to compensate the owner of a stolen item with inherited land, even if the stolen item itself is no longer extant.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> even <b>when there is guaranteed property,</b> i.e., land, <b>what of it?</b> After all, such a debt <b>is</b> legally considered <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement, <b>and</b> the creditor of <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement <b>cannot collect from the heirs</b> of the debtor, <b>nor</b> can he collect <b>from those who purchased</b> land from the debtor.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response:

Daf 105a

The reference here is to a case <b>in which</b> the father had already <b>stood trial</b> and was obligated to pay. In such a case, the debt is considered like a loan with a promissory note, which a creditor may collect from the debtor’s heirs. The Gemara rejects this: <b>If</b> it is a case <b>in which</b> the father had already <b>stood trial</b> and was obligated to pay, then the heir, who took a false oath and later confessed, would have to <b>pay even</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>as well,</b> as this would be akin to any monetary obligation; but the <i>baraita</i> rules that he is obligated to pay only the principal. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> The heir is exempt <b>because one does not pay</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>for the denial of</b> a debt that is secured by <b>a lien on land.</b>
<b>Rava said</b> a different explanation: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the stolen item is still extant, yet the heir is exempt because <b>his father’s sack [<i>disakaya</i>]</b> containing the stolen item <b>was deposited in the possession of others.</b> Accordingly, the heir <b>pays the principal, since</b> the stolen item <b>is</b> extant, but <b>he does not pay</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>because when he took an oath</b> that it was not in his possession, <b>he took an oath truthfully, as he did not know</b> that his father had stolen the item.
§ The mishna teaches that if the robbery victim forgave the robber concerning both payments, <b>excepting less than</b> the <b>value of one <i>peruta</i> of the principal,</b> he need not pursue him in order to return the remaining debt. <b>Rav Pappa says: They taught</b> that the robber is not obligated to pursue the robbery victim <b>only when</b> the <b>stolen item is not extant, but</b> if the <b>stolen item is</b> still <b>extant, he must pursue him</b> to return it, as <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the stolen item <b>will appreciate</b> in value, and the debt he owes will exceed the value of one <i>peruta</i>.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> <b>is not different</b> when the <b>stolen item is extant, and</b> it <b>is not different when</b> the <b>stolen item is not extant.</b> In either case <b>he does not need to pursue him</b> because <b>we are not concerned that perhaps it will appreciate</b> in value.
The Gemara cites another ruling with regard to a stolen item worth less than one <i>peruta</i>. <b>Rava says:</b> If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>three bundles</b> of goods that <b>were</b> worth <b>three <i>perutot</i></b> in total, <b>and they depreciated</b> in value <b>and</b> their value <b>stood at two</b> <i>perutot</i>, even <b>if he returned two</b> bundles <b>to</b> the robbery victim he <b>is obligated to return the other</b> bundle. <b>And the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna also <b>taught</b> (96b): If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>leavened bread, and Passover elapsed over it,</b> and it is therefore prohibited to derive benefit from it, the robber <b>says to</b> the victim: <b>That which is yours is before you,</b> and he is not required to pay compensation, despite the fact that the robbery victim has suffered a monetary loss.
The Gemara explains the proof from the mishna: It may be inferred that <b>the reason</b> that he is not required to pay compensation is <b>that</b> the bread <b>is</b> still <b>there in its unadulterated</b> form; <b>but</b> if it <b>is not there in its unadulterated</b> form, <b>even though now it is not</b> worth <b>money, since it was</b> worth <b>money initially,</b> at the time of the robbery, <b>he is required to pay. Here too, even though</b> the third bundle is <b>not worth one <i>peruta</i> now, since initially it was worth one <i>peruta</i>, he is required to pay.</b>
<b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>two bundles</b> of goods that <b>were</b> worth <b>one <i>peruta</i></b> in total, <b>and he returned one of them to</b> the robbery victim, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>now there is no</b> longer <b>a stolen item</b> in the possession of the robber, as the remaining bundle is worth less than one <i>peruta</i>, and he has therefore fulfilled his obligation to return the stolen item; <b>or perhaps</b> we say that since the robber <b>did not return</b> the <b>stolen item that was in his possession</b> in its entirety, he is obligated to return the second bundle?
Rava himself <b>then resolves</b> the dilemma: <b>There is no stolen item here,</b> as the remaining bundle is worth less than one <i>peruta</i>; <b>there is no returning</b> of a stolen item <b>here.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this expression: <b>If there is no stolen item here,</b> as what remains is insignificant, it follows that <b>there is</b> fulfillment of the mitzva of <b>returning</b> the stolen item <b>here,</b> and the robber ought to be exempt, as he is no longer considered to be in possession of a stolen item. The Gemara explains that <b>this is</b> what Rava <b>is saying: Even though</b> the robber is exempt from returning the second bundle, as <b>there is no stolen item here, there is</b> nevertheless <b>no</b> fulfillment of the <b>mitzva of returning</b> a stolen item <b>here,</b> since the returned bundle was worth less than one <i>peruta</i> as well.
§ Following Rava’s previous dilemma, the Gemara cites a similar dilemma raised by Rava. <b>And Rava says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that <b>a nazirite who shaved</b> his head as required <b>but left two hairs</b> uncut <b>has done nothing,</b> and his obligation to shave his head has not been fulfilled. <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If a nazirite shaved and left two hairs, and afterward he <b>shaved one</b> of them, <b>and</b> the other <b>one fell out</b> of its own accord, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this considered shaving one’s entire head or not? <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: Is Rava raising a dilemma</b> as to whether one can <b>shave</b> his head <b>one</b> hair <b>by one</b> hair? How does this case differ from that of one who shaves his entire head one hair at a time, which is a fulfillment of his obligation?
Ravina <b>said to him: No,</b> a resolution to Rava’s dilemma <b>is necessary</b> in a case <b>where one of</b> the hairs <b>fell out</b> first, <b>and</b> then <b>he shaved</b> the other <b>one. Do we say</b> that <b>now, in any event, there is no measure</b> of hair left on his head that requires shaving, as one remaining hair is not significant, and he has therefore fulfilled his obligation; <b>or perhaps</b> we say that <b>this is not</b> considered <b>shaving, as initially he left</b> the significant amount of <b>two hairs</b> uncut, <b>and now when he shaves</b> a second time, <b>there are not two hairs</b> left for him to shave, and this does not qualify as shaving?
Rava himself <b>then resolves</b> the dilemma: <b>There is no hair here; there is no shaving here.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise at this expression: <b>If there is no hair here,</b> then <b>there is shaving here,</b> as no hair remains. The Gemara explains that <b>this is what</b> Rava <b>is saying: Even though there is no hair here,</b> as only one hair remains, nevertheless <b>there is no mitzva of shaving here,</b> as he failed to shave it all on the first attempt, and the second time he shaved less than the required amount.
§ The Gemara cites another dilemma raised by Rava. <b>And Rava says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 10:6) that with regard to a sealed earthenware <b>barrel that was punctured and was</b> then <b>sealed by sediments</b> from its contents, the sediments have effectively <b>saved</b> the contents of the barrel from contracting ritual impurity if the barrel were to come into contact with an impure item, as it is once again considered a sealed barrel. <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If one <b>sealed half of</b> the hole, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Do we say that since the hole is not currently large enough to allow ritual impurity to penetrate, the barrel is considered sealed; or perhaps we say that since the hole was initially large enough to allow impurity to penetrate, and it has not yet been sealed completely, the barrel retains its status and is not considered sealed?
The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi: Isn’t this</b> <i>halakha</i> stated explicitly in <b>our mishna,</b> quoted by Rava above? <b>As we learned</b> in the continuation of that mishna: With regard to an earthenware <b>barrel that was punctured and was</b> then <b>sealed by sediments,</b> the sediments have effectively <b>saved</b> the contents of the barrel from contracting ritual impurity. If it was not sealed by sediments and instead one <b>plugged</b> the hole <b>with a vine,</b> its contents remain susceptible to contracting ritual impurity <b>until he smears</b> clay around the uncovered parts of the hole. If <b>there were two</b> vines placed in the hole in order to plug it, its contents remain susceptible to contracting ritual impurity <b>until he smears</b> clay <b>from the sides</b> of the hole inward, <b>and between one vine and the other.</b>
Rav Yeimar explains: <b>The reason</b> its contents become impervious to contracting ritual impurity is <b>that he smeared</b> clay over the uncovered sections of the hole, <b>but</b> if <b>he did not smear</b> clay over the uncovered sections, the contents would <b>not</b> be impervious to contracting ritual impurity. <b>Why</b> should this not be like the case in Rava’s dilemma? <b>But let it be</b> considered, when one plugs the hole with the vine, <b>as</b> though <b>one</b> had <b>sealed half of</b> the hole, since there is no apparent difference between a hole that is half-sealed and a hole that is partially plugged with a vine. Accordingly, Rava should not have stated his dilemma, as it is clear from the mishna that if the hole is only partially covered, the contents of the barrel are susceptible to contracting ritual impurity.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, if he does not smear</b> clay around the vines, the vine <b>will not remain</b> in place. By contrast, in a case where <b>he sealed half of it with a substance that remains</b> in place, as in Rava’s dilemma, the seal <b>remains</b> in place and could be considered a seal. Rava’s dilemma remains unresolved.
§ The Gemara cites another dilemma raised by Rava. <b>And Rava says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that if one <b>robbed</b> another of <b>leavened bread, and Passover elapsed over it,</b> and it is therefore prohibited to derive benefit from it, the robber <b>may say to</b> the victim: <b>That which is yours is before you. Rava raises a dilemma:</b>

Daf 105b

If the robber <b>took</b> a false <b>oath concerning</b> the robbery of the leavened bread, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since, if it</b> were to be <b>stolen</b> from the robber, the robber <b>would need to pay</b> the initial value of the bread <b>to</b> the robbery victim, as he can no longer say: That which is yours is before you, and therefore <b>he has denied</b> a claim of <b>a monetary matter to</b> the robbery victim and must consequently pay the additional one-fifth payment and bring a guilt-offering? <b>Or perhaps</b> we say that <b>now, in any event, it is resting</b> in the robber’s possession <b>and it is</b> considered as <b>mere dust,</b> since it is prohibited to derive benefit from it, and as such <b>he has not denied</b> a claim of <b>a monetary matter,</b> and the <i>halakhot</i> concerning a false oath do not apply.
The Gemara comments: <b>The matter that was a dilemma for Rava is obvious to Rabba, as Rabba says</b> that in a scenario where one says to another: <b>You stole my ox, and</b> the other <b>says: I did not steal</b> it.
The first asks: <b>What</b> is the <b>nature of its</b> presence <b>in your</b> possession? The second responds: <b>I am an unpaid bailee over it.</b> If the defendant then takes a false oath to that effect, after which he confesses that he stole the ox, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a guilt-offering for denying a claim of a monetary matter, <b>as he exempted himself from</b> liability in cases of <b>theft and loss.</b>
If he responds instead: <b>I am a paid bailee over it,</b> and takes a false oath to that effect, after which he confesses that he stole the ox, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a guilt-offering for denying a claim of a monetary matter, <b>as he exempted himself from</b> liability in cases of <b>breakage and death.</b>
If he responds instead: <b>I am a borrower of it,</b> and takes a false oath to that effect, after which he confesses that he stole the ox, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a guilt-offering for denying a claim of a monetary matter, <b>as he exempted himself from</b> liability in cases where the ox <b>died due to</b> ordinary <b>labor.</b>
In all of these cases, the ox is in the possession of the one who took the false oath, and he admits that it belongs to the other. The Gemara analyzes Rabba’s statement: <b>Apparently,</b> Rabba holds that <b>even though</b> the ox is now <b>extant</b> and can be returned to its owner, <b>since, if it were to be stolen,</b> the robber <b>would</b> be found to <b>be denying</b> a claim of <b>a monetary matter,</b> as according to his claim he would then be exempt from paying, he is <b>now</b> considered to <b>be denying</b> a claim of <b>a monetary matter as well. Here,</b> in the case of the bread <b>also, even though it is</b> considered <b>mere dust, since, if it were to be stolen, he would be required to pay</b> the robbery victim <b>full-fledged monetary restitution,</b> he is <b>now</b> considered to <b>be denying</b> a claim of <b>a monetary matter as well.</b>
<b>Rava sat and said this <i>halakha</i>,</b> that one who protected himself from potential liability for payment by taking a false oath that he is a bailee is liable to pay the additional one-fifth payment and bring a guilt-offering. <b>Rav Amram raised an objection to Rava</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states concerning one who is liable for taking a false oath concerning a monetary matter: <b>“And deals falsely with it”</b> (Leviticus 5:22); this serves to <b>exclude one who admits to the primary</b> feature of a claim.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>How</b> is this <b>so?</b> In a scenario where one says to another: <b>You stole my ox, and</b> the latter <b>says: I did not steal</b> it.
The first asks: <b>What</b> is the <b>nature of its</b> presence <b>in your</b> possession? The second responds with any of the following replies: <b>You sold it to me; you gave it to me as a gift; your father sold it to me; your father gave it to me as a gift; it chased after my cow</b> and entered my domain; <b>it came to me on its own; I found it straying on the road</b> and I brought it home; <b>I am an unpaid bailee over it; I am a paid bailee over it;</b> or <b>I am a borrower of it; and</b> the second <b>takes</b> a false <b>oath</b> to that effect, <b>and</b> then <b>admits</b> that he had done so; one <b>might</b> have thought that he <b>should be liable. The verse states: “And deals falsely with it,”</b> which serves to <b>exclude one who admits to the primary</b> feature of a claim. The <i>baraita</i> states explicitly that one who takes a false oath that he is a bailee is not liable; how can Rava state otherwise?
Rava <b>said to him: Fool, when that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the robber <b>said to</b> the owner: <b>Here you are,</b> and presented the ox to him immediately, so that he did not profit by claiming that he was a bailee. <b>When I spoke,</b> I was referring to a case <b>where</b> the ox <b>was standing in</b> a different place, such as <b>a swamp,</b> and was not returned to the owner.
Several examples of an oath in which the robber admits to the primary feature of a claim were cited in the <i>baraita</i> above. The Gemara analyzes some of these examples. When the robber says: <b>You sold</b> the ox <b>to me,</b> he has asserted that it belongs to him, so <b>what admission to the primary</b> feature of the claim <b>is there?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this in a case <b>where he said to him:</b> You sold the animal to me, but <b>I did not give you</b> the <b>money, take your ox and go.</b>
When the robber says: <b>You gave it to me,</b> or: <b>Your father gave it to me,</b> he has asserted that it belongs to him, so <b>what admission to the primary</b> feature of the claim <b>is there?</b> The Gemara explains: It is a case <b>where he said to him:</b> It was given to me <b>on the condition that I will afford you satisfaction, and I did not do</b> anything <b>for you; take your ox and go.</b>
When the robber says: <b>I found it straying on the road</b> and I brought it home, <b>let</b> the owner <b>say</b> to him: <b>You should have returned it to me. Shmuel’s father said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>in</b> which <b>he says:</b> I take <b>an oath</b> that <b>I found</b> the ox as <b>a lost item, and I did not know that it was yours so that I could return it to you.</b>
§ After discussing a false oath taken by a robber in which he admits to the primary feature of a claim, the Gemara discusses a false oath taken by witnesses. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When a witness takes an oath that he has no knowledge of the status of a lost item, <b>ben Azzai says</b> that <b>there are three</b> possible false <b>oaths,</b> i.e., the oath may be false for one of three reasons: The witness may have <b>recognized</b> the lost item <b>but</b> did <b>not</b> recognize <b>its finder,</b> or he may have recognized <b>its finder but</b> did <b>not</b> recognize the item, or he may have recognized <b>neither</b> the item <b>nor its finder.</b> In each of these cases, the witness took a false oath that he had no knowledge of the lost item, when in fact he had limited knowledge of it.
The Gemara asks: In the third case cited above, where the witnesses recognized <b>neither</b> the item <b>nor its finder, he took his oath in truth</b> when he claimed that he did not have knowledge of the lost item. Why is this cited as an example of a false oath? The Gemara emends the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Say</b> that the reference here is to a case where he recognized both the item <b>and its finder.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>For which <i>halakha</i></b> did ben Azzai cite these examples? <b>Rav Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> says: They were cited <b>to</b> teach that there is <b>exemption</b> in these cases from bringing an offering for taking a false oath of testimony. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that these examples were cited <b>to</b> teach that the witness incurs <b>liability</b> to bring an offering in these cases.
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> Rav Ami and Shmuel disagree <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute</b> between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who administers an oath</b> to <b>a single witness</b> and the witness takes a false oath that he has no awareness of the monetary matter at hand, the witness is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a sin-offering; <b>and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, deems</b> the witness <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>holds</b> that <b>an item that causes financial</b> loss <b>is considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value. Similarly, the potential monetary benefit that the witness can generate by causing the defendant to admit to the debt and pay the owner is considered to have monetary value. Therefore, the witness is considered to have taken a false oath with regard to a monetary matter. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that an item that causes financial loss <b>is not considered</b> to have <b>monetary</b> value. Similarly, the potential monetary benefit that the witness can generate by causing the defendant to admit to the debt and pay the owner is not considered to have monetary value. Therefore, the witness is not considered to have taken a false oath with regard to a monetary matter.
§ The Gemara discusses the <i>halakha</i> concerning a bailee who denies having a deposit in his possession. <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> A bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>denies</b> a claim <b>concerning a deposit becomes</b> as <b>a robber with regard to it, and</b> he is therefore <b>liable</b> to pay even <b>for</b> damage that is the result of <b>accidents.</b> The Gemara notes that <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> also <b>taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> in a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“And deals falsely with it”</b> (Leviticus 5:22–24), and <b>we learned</b> from this verse the <b>punishment</b> for one who denies having a deposit. <b>From where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> itself derived? <b>The verse states: “Neither shall you deal falsely”</b> (Leviticus 19:11). The Gemara explains: <b>What, is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>not</b> referring <b>to</b> the <b>punishment of</b> having to pay <b>money</b> due to his denial even for accidental damage, in accordance with the statement of Rav Sheshet?
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> the <b>punishment</b> for taking a false <b>oath,</b> i.e., the additional one-fifth payment and the bringing of the offering. The Gemara challenges: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> a case <b>where he took an oath, it may be inferred that the first clause</b> teaches a case <b>where he did not take an oath,</b> and the punishment referred to by the <i>baraita</i> is the imposition of liability for accidental damage. <b>As the latter clause teaches</b> that the verse states: <b>“And swear to a lie”</b> (Leviticus 5:22), and <b>we learned</b> from this that there is <b>a punishment</b> for taking a false oath. <b>From where</b> is the <b>prohibition</b> itself derived? <b>The verse states: “Nor lie”</b> (Leviticus 19:11). <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> teaches the <i>halakha</i> <b>where he took an oath, the first clause</b> must be teaching the <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where he did not take an oath.</b>
The Gemara answers: The Sages <b>say</b> in response that both <b>this</b> clause <b>and that</b> clause are referring to a case <b>where he took an oath,</b> but <b>here,</b> in the latter clause, it is <b>where</b> the bailee <b>admitted</b> his false oath, while <b>there,</b> in the first clause, it is <b>where witnesses came</b> and testified that the deposit is in his possession. Where <b>witnesses came,</b> he is <b>liable</b> only <b>for</b> damage that is a result of <b>accidents,</b> and <b>where he admitted</b> his false oath, he is <b>obligated</b> to pay for the <b>principal and</b> an additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and</b> to bring <b>a guilt-offering.</b> Since the <i>baraita</i> is referring in both clauses to a case where the bailee took an oath, it offers no support for Rav Sheshet’s statement.
After dismissing the attempted proof for Rav Sheshet’s statement that a bailee who denies possession of a deposit is considered a robber even without having taken a false oath, the Gemara now attempts to disprove the statement itself. <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises an objection</b> to Rav Sheshet’s statement: Though it is usually the defendant who is required to take an oath in order to avoid having to pay a claim, there are cases in which the plaintiff takes an oath to receive payment. The mishna in <i>Shevuot</i> (44b) lists these cases: <b>And</b> one such case is <b>where</b> the plaintiff’s <b>opponent,</b> i.e., the defendant, <b>is suspect with regard to an oath,</b> i.e., there is reason for the court to believe that he would take a false oath. <b>How</b> would the defendant have become suspect? It would be by having taken a false oath with regard to <b>either an oath of testimony or an oath on a deposit, or even</b> for <b>an oath</b> taken in <b>vain.</b>
The Gemara comments: Since the mishna states that he becomes suspect only as a result of having taken a false oath, it can be inferred that he does not become suspect by virtue of denial of a claim alone. <b>And if it is so</b> that a bailee who denies having taken the deposit is considered a robber even without having taken an oath, then <b>it is with</b> his <b>denial that he</b> ought to be <b>disqualified,</b> as a robber does not have the credibility to take an oath.
The Sages <b>say</b> in defense of Rav Sheshet’s opinion: <b>With what are we dealing here,</b> in the case of the mishna in <i>Shevuot</i>? We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the deposit <b>stands in</b> a place not in the bailee’s possession, e.g., <b>a swamp, as</b> in this case his statement <b>is not</b> considered a complete <b>denial, because he thinks</b> to himself: <b>I will evade</b> the owner by claiming that I never took the deposit <b>until I go and bring it to him.</b> Therefore, he is not considered to be a robber. By contrast, Rav Sheshet is referring to a case where the bailee denied responsibility for the item while it was in his possession, as he intended to keep it for himself.
The Gemara adds: <b>Know</b> that one who denies possession of an item only so that he may later return it is not considered a robber, <b>as Rav Idi bar Avin says: One who denies</b> a claim <b>concerning</b> having taken <b>a loan is fit to bear witness,</b>

Daf 106a

but one who denies a claim <b>concerning</b> having taken <b>a deposit is disqualified from bearing witness,</b> because if it is clear that the deposit is in his possession, yet he denies it, he must be lying.
The Gemara raises a further difficulty with regard to Rav Sheshet’s opinion: <b>But didn’t Ilfa say</b> that <b>an oath effects acquisition,</b> meaning that once he testified falsely that he did not become a bailee, the item in question becomes his property, rendering him liable as a robber even for damage or loss resulting from accidents? The Gemara infers: <b>It is</b> the taking of <b>an oath that effects acquisition, but</b> mere <b>denial</b> of having become a bailee <b>does not effect acquisition.</b> The Gemara rejects this distinction: <b>Here too,</b> Ilfa must be referring to a case <b>where</b> the deposit <b>stands in</b> a place not in the bailee’s possession, e.g., <b>a swamp,</b> and as long as he does not take an oath, it can be assumed that his intention is simply to be evasive. But if the animal was standing in his house, then he acquires it as soon as he denies the claim.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>What</b> is the meaning of Ilfa’s statement that <b>an oath effects acquisition?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav said</b> that if one party says: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession, and the other</b> party <b>says: You do not</b> have any money <b>in my possession, and</b> the latter <b>took an oath</b> to that effect, <b>and later, witnesses came</b> and testified that his oath was false, he is <b>exempt, as it is stated:</b> “The oath of the Lord shall be between them both, to see whether he has not put his hand unto his neighbor’s goods; <b>and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution”</b> (Exodus 22:10); teaching that <b>once the owner received an oath,</b> the one who took the oath <b>no longer pays monetary restitution.</b> Ilfa’s statement that an oath effects acquisition means that the bailee will no longer have to pay monetary restitution, and it does not relate to Rav Sheshet’s statement that the bailee becomes responsible for damage resulting from accidents as soon as he denies the claim.
§ Having mentioned Rav’s ruling, the Gemara addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that if one party says: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession, and the other</b> party <b>says: You do not</b> have any money <b>in my possession, and</b> the latter <b>takes an oath</b> to that effect, <b>and later, witnesses came</b> and testified that his oath was false, he is <b>exempt, as it is stated: “And the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution”</b> (Exodus 22:10); teaching that <b>once the owner received an oath,</b> the one who took the oath <b>no longer pays monetary restitution.</b>
<b>Rava said: Rav’s statement is reasonable in</b> the case of one who denies having taken <b>a loan, which is intended for expenditure.</b> Since the money is no longer in his possession, the Torah exempts him from monetary restitution once he takes an oath. <b>But</b> in the case of one who denies having accepted <b>a deposit, it remains in the owner’s possession</b> and must be returned intact, and it is not considered to be monetary restitution. Rava continues: <b>But, by God, Rav said</b> his statement <b>even in</b> the case of one who denies having accepted <b>a deposit, as when</b> this <b>verse</b> exempting him from payment <b>is written, it is written in</b> the case of one who denies having accepted <b>a deposit.</b>
§ The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Naḥman was sitting and saying this <i>halakha</i>. Rav Aḥa bar Minyumi raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from that which was taught in a mishna (108b): If the owner asked the bailee: <b>Where is my deposit, and</b> the bailee <b>said to him:</b> It is <b>lost,</b> and the owner said: <b>I administer an oath to you, and</b> the bailee <b>said: Amen,</b> thereby accepting the oath, <b>and the witnesses testify about</b> the bailee <b>that he consumed</b> the deposit, then he must <b>pay the principal.</b> If he <b>admitted of his own</b> accord that he had taken a false oath, then he must <b>pay</b> the <b>principal and</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering.</b> This indicates that one is required to pay monetary restitution for a deposit even after taking an oath.
<b>Rav Naḥman said to him: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where one takes an oath outside of court,</b> which does not exempt him from paying restitution. Rav Aḥa bar Minyumi <b>said to him: If so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If the owner asked the bailee: <b>Where is my deposit,</b> and the bailee <b>said to him:</b> It was <b>stolen,</b> and the owner said: <b>I administer an oath to you, and</b> the bailee <b>said: Amen,</b> thereby accepting the oath; <b>and the witnesses testify about</b> the bailee <b>that he stole it,</b> he must <b>pay</b> the <b>payment of double</b> the principal. If he <b>admitted of his own</b> accord that he had taken a false oath, then he must <b>pay</b> the <b>principal and</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering. And if it enters your mind</b> that this oath was taken <b>outside of court, is there</b> an obligation of <b>double payment</b> in such a circumstance?
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I am able to answer you</b> by saying that <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna is referring to one who took an oath <b>outside of court, and the latter clause</b> of the mishna is referring to one who took an oath <b>in court, but we will not answer you with a forced answer.</b> Instead, I will explain it in this manner: Both <b>this</b> clause <b>and that</b> clause are referring to an oath taken <b>in court, and</b> it is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the ruling of the first clause is <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>leaped</b> to take an oath as soon as the other litigant stated his claim, even though the court had not yet required him to do so, which is not considered a full-fledged oath. <b>There,</b> the ruling of the latter clause is <b>with regard to</b> one <b>who did not leap</b> but took an oath only when required by the court.
<b>Rami bar Ḥama said to Rav Naḥman: After all, you do not hold</b> in accordance with the statement <b>of Rav; why are you pledging yourself to</b> explain the statement <b>of Rav</b> so that it not be contradicted by the mishna? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> I said this not to justify Rav’s ruling but <b>to clarify</b> the statement <b>of Rav, as Rav</b> would <b>explain the mishna in this</b> manner, as I did.
The Gemara asks: <b>But Rav quoted a verse,</b> so how could Rav Naḥman not agree with his statement? The Sages <b>said</b> in response: This <b>verse</b> was not written to teach the ruling of Rav; rather, <b>it comes to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> that <b>all those</b> discussed <b>in the Torah</b> who are required to <b>take oaths, take oaths and do not pay;</b> as the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>“And the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution”</b> (Exodus 22:10), teaching that <b>one who has</b> the obligation <b>to pay is</b> the one who <b>takes an oath,</b> and not the one demanding payment.
<b>Rav Hamnuna raises an objection</b> to Rav’s statement from a different mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 36b), which states: If an owner requested the return of his deposit and the purported bailee denied having received it, and the owner <b>administered an oath</b> to the bailee <b>about</b> the deposit <b>five times, whether before the court or not before the court, and</b> the bailee <b>denied</b> the claim each time, <b>he is liable for each and every one</b> of the oaths and must pay the additional one-fifth payment and bring a guilt-offering for each one. <b>And Rabbi Shimon says: What is the reason? Since he is able to retract and admit</b> after each oath, at which point he would be liable to pay, therefore each subsequent false oath is a denial of that liability. It can be seen from this mishna that one who admits liability after having taken a false oath is liable to pay, counter to the statement of Rav.
<b>And here, you cannot say</b> that the mishna in <i>Shevuot</i> is referring to a case where the bailee <b>leaped</b> to volunteer his oath, because it <b>teaches</b> explicitly that the owner <b>administered an oath</b> to the bailee <b>about</b> the deposit. And <b>you cannot say</b> that the mishna in <i>Shevuot</i> is referring to a case where the bailee took his oath <b>outside of court,</b> because it <b>teaches</b> explicitly that the <i>halakha</i> applies whether the oath was taken <b>before the court</b> or not before the court.
The Gemara explains: <b>He,</b> Rav Hamnuna, <b>raised the objection and he resolved it:</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches it disjunctively,</b> i.e., the rulings of the mishna are stated with regard to different circumstances. Where it teaches that the owner <b>administered an oath</b> to the bailee <b>about</b> the deposit, that is referring to <b>outside of court, and</b> when it discusses an oath taken <b>before the court,</b> it is referring to a case where the bailee <b>leaped</b> and volunteered his oath. Therefore, the mishna does not discuss the case with regard to which Rav issued his ruling, where the bailee was forced to take an oath before the court.
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> to Rav’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a homeowner</b> acting as a bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>claimed, with regard to a deposit,</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole it, <b>and he took an oath</b> to that effect <b>and</b> subsequently <b>admitted</b> that he was lying and that in fact he took the item himself, <b>and witnesses came</b> and testified that the bailee himself indeed took the item, then <b>if he admitted</b> his guilt <b>before</b> the <b>witnesses came</b> and testified, <b>he pays</b> the <b>principal</b> value of the item <b>and</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and</b> he must also bring <b>a guilt-offering. But if he admitted</b> his guilt <b>after</b> the <b>witnesses came</b> and testified, <b>he pays</b> the <b>double payment and</b> brings <b>a guilt-offering.</b> This <i>baraita</i> rules that one who takes an oath is not exempt from payment, counter to the statement of Rav.
<b>And here,</b> in this <i>baraita</i>, <b>you cannot say that</b> it is referring to an oath taken <b>outside of court or</b> that he <b>leaped</b> and volunteered his oath, because <b>double payment is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, and one is obligated to pay double payment only when the accused has an oath administered to him before the court.
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> In <b>any</b> case where one <b>admits</b> to having taken a false oath, there <b>is no difference</b> whether one falsely <b>states the claim</b> that the deposit <b>was lost, and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> whether one falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit <b>as well;</b> in these cases, <b>Rav did not say</b> that taking an oath exempts the bailee from restitution, <b>because it is written</b> in the Torah portion discussing a false oath taken with regard to a deposit: <b>“And they shall confess</b> the sin that they performed, and he shall return the principal for his guilt, and he shall add to it one-fifth, and he gives it to the one with regard to whom is guilty” (Numbers 5:7), teaching <b>that</b> anyone who admits to a false oath concerning a deposit <b>is required to pay the principal and</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment.
The Gemara continues Rava's statement: Additionally, in a case where one falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit and takes an oath to that effect <b>and witnesses come</b> and say that he had stolen it, <b>as well, Rav did not say</b> that taking an oath exempts the bailee from restitution, <b>because double payment is written</b> in the Torah (see Exodus 22:8). <b>When he says</b> that taking an oath exempts the bailee from restitution, it is in a case <b>where one</b> falsely <b>states the claim that</b> the deposit <b>was lost and takes an oath</b> to that effect, <b>and did not admit it, and witnesses come</b> and testify that he had stolen it.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Gamda went and said that <i>halakha</i> before Rav Ashi.</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Now</b> consider: <b>And even Rav Hamnuna,</b> who was <b>Rav’s student and knew that Rav says</b> that one who takes a false oath is exempt from paying restitution even in a case where he <b>admitted</b> it; <b>and</b> Rav Hamnuna therefore <b>challenged</b> him from a mishna that teaches that one is not exempt in a case where he <b>admitted</b> it. <b>And you say</b> that <b>Rav did not say</b> his <i>halakha</i> in a case where one <b>admitted</b> that he took a false oath? Presumably, Rav Hamnuna, as Rav’s student, was aware of the scope of his teacher’s ruling. How, then, can you limit it as being narrower than Rav Hamnuna’s interpretation?
<b>Rav Aḥa the Elder said to Rav Ashi: Rav Hamnuna</b> did not raise a difficulty against Rav with regard to the case of one admitting to having taken a false oath, rather, with regard to the case where witnesses came after he took the oath, and <b>this</b> is what <b>is difficult for him:</b>

Daf 106b

<b>Granted, if you say</b> that when <b>one takes</b> a false <b>oath</b> and <b>then witnesses come, he is liable</b> to pay, <b>that is why we hold him liable</b> for a guilt-<b>offering for the final oath, since he can</b> still <b>retract and admit</b> his liability and incur an obligation to pay. Consequently, the fact that he took another false oath constitutes an additional false denial of his monetary liability.
<b>But if you say,</b> as Rav did, that even <b>when witnesses come he is exempt</b> from paying, then the mishna’s ruling is difficult, as <b>is there any</b> similar case <b>where if witnesses come and testify with regard to it, he would be exempt, and</b> yet <b>we would stand and obligate him</b> to bring a guilt-<b>offering for a</b> later <b>oath,</b> for no reason other than <b>since he can</b> still <b>retract and admit</b> his liability? As of <b>now, in any event, he has not admitted</b> to any liability and has no extant debt, and any further oaths that he takes are not denials of monetary liability. It follows, then, that Rava’s explanation of Rav’s opinion cannot be undermined by Rav Hamnuna’s challenge.
§ The Gemara cites another ruling concerning the topic of a bailee who claims that a deposit in his possession was stolen. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: One who</b> falsely <b>states the claim, with regard to a deposit,</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole it, and it becomes clear that he stole it himself, <b>pays double payment. If he slaughtered or sold</b> it, <b>he</b> must <b>pay fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
He explains his ruling by means of a comparison: <b>Since a thief pays double payment, and</b> one who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit also <b>pays double payment,</b> it follows that <b>just as a thief, who</b> ordinarily <b>pays double payment,</b> and if he <b>slaughtered or sold</b> an animal he stole <b>pays fourfold or fivefold payment, so too,</b> one who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole <b>a deposit, who</b> ordinarily <b>pays double payment,</b> if he <b>slaughtered or sold</b> the animal he received as a deposit <b>pays fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a thief?</b> It is notable <b>in that</b> he <b>pays double payment</b> even <b>without</b> having taken a false <b>oath; will you say</b> that this stringency should apply <b>with regard to</b> one who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, <b>who pays double payment only upon</b> taking a false <b>oath?</b> Therefore, one cannot derive from the obligation of a thief to pay fourfold or fivefold payment to the case of one who falsely states the claim that the deposit was stolen.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: Rabbi Yoḥanan did not base his ruling on a logical inference; rather, <b>it is</b> a derivation based upon <b>a juxtaposition,</b> as the verses discussing a thief and one who falsely states the claim that a deposit was stolen are juxtaposed, <b>and one cannot refute</b> through analysis a derivation based upon <b>juxtaposition.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>one</b> verse is stated <b>with regard to a thief and one</b> verse is stated <b>with regard to</b> one who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit. According to him, there is a juxtaposition, and one can <b>well</b> derive one from the other. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>both this</b> verse: <b>“If the thief shall be found,</b> he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6), <b>and: “If the thief shall not be found”</b> (Exodus 22:7), are referring to one who falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit, and neither verse is referring to a thief, <b>what is there to say?</b>
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: Rabbi Yoḥanan’s ruling is derived from an amplification indicated by the verse not employing the term <b>“thief [<i>gannav</i>],”</b> and instead employing the expanded term <b>“the thief [<i>hagannav</i>].”</b> This teaches that the <i>halakha</i> of the fourfold and fivefold payment applies to one who falsely states the claim that the deposit was stolen, as well.
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba raised an objection to</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In a scenario where one said to an unpaid bailee: <b>Where is my ox?</b> Then the bailee responded: It <b>was stolen.</b> And the owner said: <b>I administer an oath to you, and</b> the bailee <b>said: Amen. And the witnesses testify about</b> the bailee <b>that he ate it,</b> he <b>pays double payment. But here,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that it is impossible to</b> eat even <b>an olive-bulk of meat without slaughtering</b> the animal first, indicating that it must have been slaughtered, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>it teaches</b> that he <b>pays double payment.</b> It can be inferred that <b>double payment, yes,</b> he pays; but <b>fourfold or fivefold payment, no,</b> he does not pay.
Rabbi Yoḥanan answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he ate it</b> as an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass.</b> Since it was not killed according to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual slaughter, the thief does not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>answer</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba by saying that it is a case <b>such as where he ate it</b> as <b>an animal with a wound that will cause it to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> in accordance with Rabbi Shimon’s opinion that the legal status of an act of slaughter that is not fit for accomplishing its full ritual purpose is not considered an act of slaughter for which the thief must pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. The Gemara responds that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that the legal status of an act of <b>slaughter that is not fit</b> for accomplishing its full ritual purpose <b>is considered</b> an act of <b>slaughter,</b> and the thief would pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.
The Gemara further asks: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>answer</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba by saying that the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to an animal removed from its mother’s womb after the mother was ritually slaughtered [<i>ben pekua</i>],</b> which is permitted for consumption without slaughter, so that there is a possibility that the thief ate it without first slaughtering it. The Gemara responds that Rabbi Yoḥanan holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>a <i>ben pekua</i> requires slaughter.</b>
The Gemara further asks: <b>And let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>answer</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba by saying that it is a case <b>where</b> the bailee <b>stood in judgment</b> in court, <b>and</b> the judges <b>said to him: Go out</b> and <b>give him</b> the stolen animal, and he did not do so, and subsequently slaughtered or sold it? In this case he would not pay the fourfold or fivefold payment, <b>as doesn’t Rava say</b> that if the judges instruct a thief: <b>Go out</b> and <b>give him</b> the stolen animal, <b>and he</b> instead <b>slaughtered or sold</b> it, he is <b>exempt</b> from paying the fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Once</b> the court <b>ruled on his matter,</b> requiring him to give the animal to the owner, and he did not heed the court’s ruling <b>but slaughtered or sold</b> the animal, <b>he is</b> considered <b>a robber,</b> and not a thief; <b>and a robber does not pay fourfold or fivefold payment.</b>
Rava continues: But if the judges say only: <b>You are obligated to give</b> the animal <b>to him,</b> and he did not heed the court’s statement <b>but slaughtered or sold</b> the animal, then he is <b>obligated</b> to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Since</b> the court <b>has not issued a definitive ruling in</b> this <b>matter, he is still</b> considered <b>a thief</b> rather than a robber.
The Sages <b>say</b> in response: <b>And according to your reasoning, let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>answer</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba by saying that the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to a partner who slaughtered</b> an animal stolen by him and his partner <b>without the other</b> partner’s <b>knowledge,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> is that in such a case, the thief, i.e., the partner who slaughtered the animal, does not pay fourfold or fivefold payment. <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>selected one of two or three</b> possible answers but did not mean to say that it was the only possible answer.
§ The Gemara cites a related ruling: <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim, with regard to a lost item,</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole it, i.e., he found a lost item, and when the owner requested its return, he claimed that it had been stolen from him, and it became known that he lied and had taken the item himself, <b>he pays double payment. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As it is written</b> in the verse concerning double payment for a thief: “For any matter of trespass, from an ox, for a donkey, for a sheep, for a garment, or <b>for any lost item about which one shall say:</b> This is it, the claims of both of them shall come before the judges; the one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor” (Exodus 22:8). It can be seen from here that double payment applies to a false claim of theft even with regard to a lost item.
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel raised an objection to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states: <b>“If a man gives</b> his neighbor money or vessels to safeguard, and it was stolen from the house of the man, if the thief shall be found, he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6). The use of the word “man” indicates that the <b>giving</b> of a deposit <b>by a minor is nothing. And I have</b> derived <b>only</b> a case <b>where he gives</b> the deposit <b>when he is a minor and lodges the claim</b> concerning it <b>against</b> the bailee <b>when he is</b> still a <b>minor. From where</b> is it derived that the <i>halakha</i> would be the same in a case where <b>he gives</b> the deposit <b>when he is a minor and lodges the claim</b> concerning it <b>against</b> the bailee <b>when he is an adult? The verse states: “The claims of both of them shall come before the judges”</b> (Exodus 22:8), i.e., the claim is valid <b>only when</b> the <b>giving</b> of the deposit <b>and</b> the <b>claim are equal,</b> both done when he is an adult.
Based on the ruling of this <i>baraita</i>, Rabbi Abba bar Memel raises his objection: <b>And if it is so</b> that even one who finds a lost item pays double payment for claiming falsely that it was stolen, indicating that the giving of the item as a deposit by the owner is not an essential condition to render the thief liable for double payment, then the claim of a minor <b>should be like a lost item as well,</b> and one who received a deposit from a minor should be liable for double payment. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to him: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the bailee <b>consumed</b> the deposit <b>when</b> the owner <b>was</b> still <b>a minor,</b> so that at the time it was consumed, the owner had no legal standing. Therefore, the bailee is not obligated to pay.
Rabbi Abba bar Memel questions this answer: <b>But</b> had the bailee consumed it <b>when</b> the owner was already <b>an adult, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>; <b>indeed,</b> would the <i>halakha</i> be <b>that</b> the bailee <b>pays? If so, rather than teaching:</b> The claim is valid <b>only when</b> the <b>giving</b> of the deposit <b>and</b> the <b>claim are equal, let</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach:</b> The claim is valid <b>only when</b> the <b>consumption</b> of the deposit <b>and</b> the <b>claim are equal,</b> which would be a more precise ruling. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to him:</b> Emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>teach:</b> The claim is valid <b>only when</b> the <b>consumption</b> of the deposit <b>and</b> the <b>claim are equal.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> a different answer to Rabbi Abba bar Memel’s objection: The two cases <b>are not comparable,</b> so an objection to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba’s statement concerning a lost item cannot be derived from the case of a minor giving a deposit, because the <b>lost item came</b> into the possession of the finder <b>by</b> the <b>power of one</b> who is <b>mentally competent,</b> as the one who lost it is presumed to be an adult, though he did not personally give it to the finder; <b>but this</b> deposit given by a minor <b>did not come</b> into his possession <b>by</b> the <b>power of one</b> who is <b>mentally competent,</b> as from a halakhic perspective, a minor is not considered mentally competent. Therefore, he has no grounds for a claim.
§ The Gemara quotes a related ruling: <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim, with regard to a deposit,</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole it, <b>he is not obligated</b> to take an oath, nor to pay double payment, <b>until he denies part of</b> the claim <b>and admits to part of</b> the claim. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As the verse states:</b> “About which one shall say: <b>This is it”</b> (Exodus 22:8), indicating an admittance of only this part, but no more. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this <b>disagrees</b> with the ruling <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef, as Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says:</b>

Daf 107a

<b>A merging of</b> Torah <b>portions is written here,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> written in this passage is in fact meant to be applied to a different passage. <b>And when it is written: “This is it,”</b> from which the <i>halakha</i> of a partial admission is derived, <b>it is written concerning a loan,</b> not a deposit. The Gemara asks: <b>And what is different</b> about <b>a loan</b> that this <i>halakha</i> would apply only there?
The Gemara answers: It is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabba, as Rabba says: For what</b> reason <b>did the Torah say</b> that one who <b>admits to a part of the claim must take an oath?</b> It is because there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>a person does not exhibit insolence</b> by lying <b>in the presence of his creditor,</b> who had done him a favor by lending money to him. <b>And this</b> person who denies part of the claim actually <b>wants to deny all of</b> the debt, so as to be exempt, <b>and this</b> fact <b>that he does not deny</b> all of <b>it</b> is <b>because a person does not exhibit insolence.</b>
Rabba continues: <b>And</b> in order not to exhibit insolence, he <b>wants to admit to</b> the creditor <b>with regard to all of</b> the debt, <b>and this</b> fact <b>that he denies</b> owing <b>him in part</b> is because he <b>reasons: If I admit to him with regard to all of</b> the debt, <b>he will lodge a claim against me with regard to all of it,</b> and right now I do not have the money to pay. <b>I will evade him at least</b> for <b>now until I have money, and</b> then <b>I will pay</b> him all of it. This rationalization enables one to falsely deny part of a claim. <b>Therefore, the Merciful One imposes an oath on him, in order</b> to ensure <b>that he will admit to him with regard to all of</b> the debt.
The Gemara completes its answer: <b>And it is with regard to a loan that this can be said,</b> as the basis for this explanation is that one will not exhibit insolence before his creditor, who did him a favor by lending him money; <b>but with regard to a deposit, one will certainly exhibit insolence,</b> as the claimant did him no favor. Therefore, there is no reason to say that one who completely denies a claim concerning a deposit is deemed credible any more than one who admitted to part of it, and he is obligated to take an oath in either case.
§ <b>Rami bar Ḥama teaches</b> this <i>baraita</i>: All <b>four</b> types of <b>bailees</b>

Daf 107b

<b>require denial of a part of</b> the claim <b>and admittance of a part of</b> the claim in order to be obligated to take an oath when someone claims to have given them an item as a deposit, <b>and these are they: An unpaid bailee, and a borrower, a paid bailee, and a renter.</b>
The Gemara quotes the source for this statement. <b>Rava said: What is the reasoning</b> for the statement <b>of Rami bar Ḥama?</b> Concerning <b>an unpaid bailee, it is explicitly written with regard to him: “This is it,”</b> as explained earlier. Concerning <b>a paid bailee,</b> Rami bar Ḥama <b>learns</b> by means of a verbal analogy to the term <b>giving</b> used with regard to a paid bailee <b>from</b> the term <b>giving</b> used with regard to <b>an unpaid bailee,</b> since the verses about both a paid and an unpaid bailee begin: “If a man gives his neighbor” (Exodus 22:6, 9).
Rava continues: Rami bar Ḥama learns the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>a borrower</b> from the verse: <b>“And if [<i>vekhi</i>] a man borrow”</b> (Exodus 22:13). There is a principle that the conjunction “and,” represented by the letter <b><i>vav</i>, adds to the previous topic.</b> Based on this principle, the <i>halakhot</i> of a borrower are connected to those of the subject of the previous verse, the bailee. Concerning <b>a renter, if</b> Rami bar Ḥama is stating his ruling <b>according to the one who says</b> that a renter is <b>like a paid bailee,</b> this <b>is</b> the same as <b>a paid bailee; if</b> he is stating his ruling <b>according to the one who says</b> that a renter is <b>like an unpaid bailee,</b> this <b>is</b> the same as <b>an unpaid bailee.</b>
§ <b>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef says:</b> With regard to an unpaid bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>states the claim, with regard to a deposit,</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole it, and is discovered to have lied, <b>he is not liable</b> to pay double payment <b>unless he misappropriates it,</b> i.e., uses it for his own needs, before taking his oath. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The verse states: “If the thief shall not be found, <b>the owner of the house shall approach the judges to determine if he misappropriated his neighbor’s goods”</b> (Exodus 22:7), and the following verse concludes: “The one whom the judges convict shall pay double to his neighbor.” <b>By inference,</b> one can learn <b>that if he misappropriated it, he is liable</b> for double payment; <b>that is to say that we are dealing</b> only <b>with</b> a case <b>where he misappropriates it.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to</b> his students: <b>This</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> that one who falsely claims that the deposit was stolen is liable for double payment <b>with regard to</b> an animal still <b>standing over its</b> feeding <b>trough,</b> i.e., the bailee is still safeguarding it for its owner. <b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: Is he stating</b> his ruling <b>specifically with regard to</b> an animal <b>standing over its</b> feeding <b>trough, but if the</b> bailee <b>misappropriated it</b> before taking an oath, he has <b>acquired</b> it, <b>and an oath is not effective for him at all,</b> not even to cause him to be liable to pay double payment? <b>Or perhaps he is stating</b> his ruling <b>even with regard to</b> an animal <b>standing over its</b> feeding <b>trough,</b> in addition to an animal that the bailee misappropriated?
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to him: I did not hear this</b> ruling, so I cannot transmit Rabbi Yoḥanan’s opinion, but <b>I did hear</b> something <b>similar to it, as Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to an unpaid bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that the deposit <b>was lost and takes an oath</b> to that effect, <b>and retracted and</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit <b>and takes an oath</b> to that effect, <b>and witnesses came</b> and testified that he lied, he is <b>exempt</b> from double payment for the second claim. <b>What is the reason; is it not due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> he already <b>acquired</b> the item <b>with</b> the <b>first oath,</b> and therefore the second oath is disregarded, which is why he is not liable for double payment for a false claim of theft? So too, one who misappropriates the deposit thereby acquires it and is no longer obligated to take an oath.
Rabbi Zeira <b>said to him: No,</b> there is no proof from there, because one could argue that the reason is not because he acquired the item with the first oath; rather, <b>since it left the owner’s possession with</b> the bailee taking the <b>first oath,</b> he is exempt from taking an additional oath with regard to the same claim, but his oath will be significant even after having misappropriated the item.
It <b>was also stated: Rabbi Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ile’a says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who</b> falsely <b>states the claim, with regard to a deposit, that</b> it is now <b>lost, and takes an oath</b> to that effect, <b>and retracts and</b> falsely <b>states the claim that</b> the deposit was taken through <b>theft and takes an oath</b> to that effect, <b>and witnesses come</b> and testify that he lied with regard to the claim of theft, he is <b>exempt</b> from double payment for the second claim, <b>since it left the owner’s possession with</b> the bailee taking the <b>first oath.</b>
The Gemara cites an <i>amora</i> who disputes the ruling of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Yosef. <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> With regard to an unpaid bailee <b>who</b> falsely <b>states the claim, with regard to a deposit,</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole it, and is discovered to have lied, <b>once he misappropriated it</b> before he took an oath he is <b>exempt. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>This is</b> what <b>the Merciful One is saying,</b> i.e., this is how the verse is to be understood: “If the thief shall not be found, <b>the owner of the house shall approach the judges if he has not misappropriated</b> his neighbor’s goods” (Exodus 22:7), indicating that this verse speaks specifically with regard to a case where he did not misappropriate the deposit; <b>consequently,</b> if <b>he misappropriated it,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from double payment.
<b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> Rav Sheshet: <b>But aren’t three oaths administered</b> by the court <b>to</b> any unpaid bailee who claims that the deposit was stolen from him? The first is: <b>An oath that I was not negligent in</b> safeguarding <b>it,</b> thereby enabling it to be stolen; the second is: <b>An oath that I did not misappropriate it;</b> the third is: <b>An oath that it is not in my possession. What, is it not</b> so that: <b>An oath that I did not misappropriate it,</b> is <b>similar to: An oath that it is not in my possession,</b> in the following manner: <b>Just as</b> with regard to: <b>An oath that it is not in my possession, when the matter becomes revealed that it is in his possession,</b> he is <b>liable, so too,</b> with regard to: <b>An oath that I did not misappropriate it, when the matter becomes revealed that he did misappropriate it,</b> he should be <b>liable?</b>
Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: No,</b> there is no proof from there, because one could say that the <i>halakha</i> of: <b>An oath that I did not misappropriate it,</b> is <b>similar to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of: An oath <b>that I was not negligent in</b> safeguarding <b>it,</b> in the following manner: <b>Just as</b> with regard to: <b>An oath that I was not negligent in</b> safeguarding <b>it, when the matter becomes revealed that he was negligent in</b> safeguarding <b>it,</b> he is <b>exempt from double payment, so too,</b> with regard to: <b>An oath that I did not misappropriate it, when the matter becomes revealed that he did misappropriate it,</b> he is <b>exempt from double payment.</b> Since the comparison can be made between different pairings of the oaths to suggest opposite conclusions, none of these comparisons are definitive.
§ The <i>baraita</i> quoted earlier (65b) teaches that a bailee who would be liable for double payment if witnesses were to testify that he had in fact stolen a deposit about which he had taken an oath attesting to its theft does not pay the additional one-fifth payment normally imposed upon one who takes a false oath with regard to a monetary claim. The Gemara explores the reason for this <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma:</b> Is it the <b>monetary</b> obligation <b>that renders him liable</b> for <b>double payment</b> which <b>exempts him from the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>or perhaps</b> is it the taking of the <b>oath that renders him liable for double payment</b> which <b>exempts him from the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment?
The Gemara explains: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which there is a practical difference between these possibilities? It is in a case <b>where he</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit <b>and takes an oath</b> to that effect, <b>and retracts and</b> falsely <b>states the claim</b> that it <b>was lost and takes an oath</b> to that effect,

Daf 108a

<b>and witnesses come</b> and testify <b>with regard to</b> his <b>first</b> claim that at the time he took an oath that the deposit had been stolen, it was actually in his possession; <b>and he admits with regard to</b> his <b>second</b> claim that it had been a lie and that it had not actually been lost, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>: Is he obligated to pay the additional one-fifth payment?
The Gemara explains the two possibilities: Is it being obligated in <b>a monetary</b> obligation <b>that renders him liable</b> for <b>double payment</b> which <b>exempts him from the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and</b> in this case <b>he is liable</b> for <b>the double payment for</b> the deposit due to the witness testimony and would therefore be exempt from the additional one-fifth payment? <b>Or perhaps</b> is it admitting to a false <b>oath that renders him liable</b> for <b>double payment</b> which <b>exempts him from the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>this latter oath</b> that the item was lost, <b>since it does not render him liable</b> for <b>the double payment,</b> as he took an oath that it had been lost, not stolen, <b>will it render him liable</b> for <b>the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment?
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to this dilemma from a mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 49b): In a scenario where one <b>said to someone from the marketplace: Where is my ox that you stole? And</b> the accused <b>says</b> in response: <b>I did not steal</b> it; whereupon the owner of the ox said: <b>I administer an oath to you, and</b> the accused <b>said: Amen,</b> accepting the oath; <b>and the witnesses testify about</b> the accused <b>that he stole it,</b> he must <b>pay double payment. And if he admitted of his own</b> accord that he stole it, then he must <b>pay the principal and</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering.</b>
Rava explains the proof: <b>But here,</b> it is <b>witnesses who render him liable</b> for <b>the double payment,</b> as since the accused was not a bailee, the oath does not render him liable, and yet the mishna teaches that if <b>he admitted of his own</b> accord that he stole it, then <b>yes,</b> he must pay the additional one-fifth payment, <b>but</b> if <b>he admitted after witnesses</b> testified, then <b>no,</b> he is not required to pay the additional one-fifth.
Rava continues: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that it is <b>an oath that renders him liable</b> for <b>double payment</b> which <b>exempts him from the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>why</b> does he <b>not</b> pay the additional one-fifth payment if <b>he admitted</b> that it was a false oath <b>after witnesses</b> testified? <b>After all, this oath does not render him liable</b> to pay <b>the double payment,</b> as the <i>halakha</i> that one who falsely takes an oath that the item was stolen pays double payment applies only in the case of a bailee; therefore, the oath <b>should render him liable</b> to pay <b>the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, as does any false oath taken with regard to a monetary claim.
Rava completes the proof: <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> this mishna that it is the <b>monetary</b> obligation <b>that renders him liable</b> to pay the <b>double payment</b> which <b>exempts him from the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment? The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that the additional one-fifth payment is dependent upon the type of monetary obligation, and not an oath, resolving Rami bar Ḥama’s dilemma.
§ Concerning the additional one-fifth payment, <b>Ravina raises a dilemma:</b> If the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>and the double payment</b> are split <b>among two men, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains the dilemma: <b>What are the circumstances?</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>transferred his ox to two people</b> to safeguard, <b>and they stated the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole <b>it</b> from them; <b>one</b> of them <b>took an oath</b> that it had been stolen <b>and</b> subsequently <b>admitted</b> of his own accord that he had lied, <b>and one</b> of them <b>took an oath</b> that it had been stolen <b>and</b> subsequently <b>witnesses came</b> and testified that he had lied. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case?
Ravina clarifies the possibilities: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>the Merciful One is particular with regard to one man that he does not pay</b> both <b>the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>and the double payment,</b> whereas in this case, <b>this one</b> about whom the witnesses testified <b>will pay the double payment and that one</b> who admitted of his own accord <b>will pay the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment? <b>Or perhaps the Merciful One is particular that the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>and the double payment will not be paid for one monetary</b> obligation, <b>and here too, it is one monetary</b> obligation? The Gemara comments: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ Concerning the additional one-fifth payment, <b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> In a case of <b>two</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payments <b>or two double payments with regard to one man, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>; must he pay twice for the same monetary obligation? The Gemara explains: <b>What are the circumstances?</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>stated the claim</b> that the deposit <b>was lost and took an oath and</b> then <b>admitted</b> that it was not lost, <b>and returned and</b> again <b>stated the claim</b> that the same deposit <b>was lost, and took</b> another <b>oath</b> supporting this claim <b>and</b> again <b>admitted</b> that it was not lost. <b>Alternatively,</b> this is referring to a case <b>where</b> one <b>stated the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the deposit <b>and took an oath and</b> then <b>witnesses came</b> and testified that he had taken it, <b>and he returned and</b> again <b>stated the claim</b> that <b>a thief</b> stole the same deposit <b>and</b> again <b>took an oath and</b> then <b>witnesses came</b> and again testified that he had taken it; <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>?
Rav Pappa clarifies the possibilities: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>the Merciful One states</b> concerning <b>two types of monetary restitution,</b> e.g., double payment and the additional one-fifth payment, <b>that they will not be paid for one monetary</b> obligation, <b>but here, it is</b> only <b>one type,</b> merely doubled; <b>or perhaps the Merciful One states</b> concerning <b>two</b> payments of <b>monetary restitution that they will not be paid for one monetary</b> obligation, <b>and here too, they are two</b> payments of <b>monetary restitution,</b> whether in the case of two additional one-fifth payments or two double payments?
The Gemara suggests resolution to Rav Pappa’s dilemma. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rava says:</b> The verse states: “Or anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full, <b>and shall add the fifth part [<i>ḥamishitav</i>] more thereto”</b> (Leviticus 5:24). By employing a plural term, <i>ḥamishitav</i>, and not the singular <i>ḥamishito</i>, <b>the Torah added many</b> additional <b>one-fifths for one principal,</b> meaning that one can become obligated in multiple one-fifth payments for the same principal. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> Rava’s statement that this is the <i>halakha</i>.
§ The Gemara discusses an amoraic dispute concerning a similar case: If <b>an owner demanded of</b> an unpaid <b>bailee</b> that he return a deposit, and he claimed that it had been stolen from him <b>and took an oath</b> to that effect, <b>and</b> despite being exempt from payment, <b>he paid</b> of his own volition, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>the thief was identified, to whom</b> is <b>double payment</b> paid, the owner or the bailee? <b>Abaye says: To the owner of the deposit. Rava says: To the one in whose</b> possession <b>the deposit</b> was when it was stolen, i.e., the bailee.
The Gemara explains their opinions: <b>Abaye says</b> that the double payment is paid <b>to the owner of the deposit; since</b> the bailee <b>troubled him by</b> taking <b>an oath</b> instead of paying immediately, the owner is <b>not</b> willing to <b>grant acquisition of the double payment to</b> the bailee, so it is paid to the owner. <b>Rava says</b> that the double payment is paid <b>to the one in whose</b> possession <b>the deposit</b> was when it was stolen; <b>once he paid,</b> the owner <b>grants acquisition of the double payment to</b> the bailee.
The Gemara explains: <b>And they disagree with regard to the</b> deductive <b>inference</b> to be drawn from the wording <b>of the mishna, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 33b): In the case of <b>one who deposits with another,</b> i.e., an unpaid bailee, <b>an animal or vessels, and they were stolen or lost,</b> and the bailee <b>paid</b> the owner <b>and did not wish to take an oath,</b> which he may decide to do, <b>as</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>an unpaid bailee takes an oath</b> that he is exempt <b>and is released</b> from the obligation to pay the owner, but may also opt to pay; in such a case the <i>halakha</i> is that if <b>the thief was found he pays double payment,</b> or if the deposited item was a sheep or an ox and the thief <b>slaughtered or sold</b> it <b>he pays</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment. To whom does</b> the thief <b>pay</b> those payments? He pays them <b>to the one in whose</b> possession <b>the deposit</b> was when it was stolen or lost. When the bailee paid the owner for the stolen item, he acquired it and therefore is entitled to any payment of principal or fine paid by the thief.
The mishna continues: If the bailee <b>took an oath and did not wish to pay,</b> and <b>the thief was</b> later <b>found</b> and was required to <b>pay double payment,</b> or he <b>slaughtered or sold</b> the sheep or ox and was required to <b>pay</b> the <b>fourfold or fivefold payment, to whom does</b> the thief <b>pay</b> the money? He pays it <b>to the owner of the deposit,</b> not to the bailee.
The Gemara explains the dispute: <b>Abaye inferred</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the wording of <b>the first clause,</b> and <b>Rava inferred</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the wording of <b>the latter clause. Abaye inferred</b> it <b>from</b> the wording of <b>the first clause, as it teaches:</b> If the bailee <b>paid</b> the owner <b>and did not wish to take an oath,</b> the thief pays the double, fourfold, or fivefold payment to the bailee. Abaye infers from here that <b>the reason</b> the thief pays the bailee is specifically <b>that</b> he <b>did not wish to take an oath,</b>

Daf 108b

<b>but</b> if he <b>took an oath, even though he</b> subsequently <b>paid, to whom does</b> the thief <b>pay</b> double payment? <b>To the owner of the deposit.</b>
<b>Rava inferred</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>from</b> the wording of <b>the latter clause.</b> It teaches: If the bailee <b>took an oath and did not want to pay,</b> the thief must pay the penalty to the owner of the deposit. Rava infers from here that <b>the reason</b> the thief pays the owner is specifically <b>that</b> he <b>did not want to pay, but</b> if he <b>did pay, even though</b> he <b>took an oath</b> previously, <b>to whom does</b> the thief <b>pay</b> double payment? <b>To the one in whose</b> possession <b>the deposit</b> was when it was lost.
The Gemara notes: The inference from <b>the latter clause is difficult for</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye.</b> The Gemara explains. <b>Abaye</b> could have <b>said to you: This is what</b> the latter clause of the mishna <b>is teaching:</b> If the bailee <b>took an oath and did not want to pay</b> initially <b>before</b> taking <b>the oath,</b> but <b>rather</b> wanted to pay only <b>after</b> having taken <b>the oath,</b> in this case <b>to whom does</b> the thief <b>pay</b> double payment? <b>To the owner of the deposit.</b> Similarly, the Gemara notes: The inference from <b>the first clause is difficult for</b> the opinion of <b>Rava.</b> The Gemara explains. <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: This is what</b> the first clause of the mishna <b>is teaching:</b> If he <b>paid,</b> meaning he had taken an oath <b>and did not want to stand by his oath, but</b> instead <b>paid</b> in order to nullify the oath he had taken, <b>to whom does</b> the thief <b>pay</b> double payment? <b>To the one in whose</b> possession <b>the deposit</b> was when it was lost.
§ The Gemara relates another dilemma concerning the status of a bailee and stolen deposits. If the <b>owner</b> of a deposit <b>demanded from a bailee</b> that he return their deposit, and he claimed that it had been stolen from him <b>and took an oath</b> to that effect; <b>and</b> then <b>the thief was recognized,</b> and <b>the bailee demanded of</b> the thief to pay <b>and he admitted</b> to having stolen it; and then the <b>owner demanded of</b> the thief to pay <b>and he denied</b> the claim, <b>and</b> the owner <b>brought witnesses</b> that he had stolen it, <b>did the thief become exempt</b> from double payment <b>through</b> his <b>admission</b> to the <b>bailee,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> when one admits liability to a penalty? Does the bailee have standing vis-à-vis the thief despite having exempted himself by taking an oath to the owner, <b>or did the thief not become exempt through</b> his <b>admission</b> to the <b>bailee?</b>
<b>Rava says: If</b> he <b>took an oath truthfully,</b> i.e., if it now becomes clear through the testimony of witnesses that the bailee’s oath was true, he is assumed to be someone the owner would rely on to collect the stolen item for him, and he remains a bailee. Therefore, <b>the thief became exempt through</b> his <b>admission</b> to the <b>bailee. If</b> his <b>oath</b> was <b>taken falsely,</b> e.g., he took an oath that the animal given as a deposit died naturally and it is now clear that his oath was false, he is assumed to be someone whom the owner would not rely on to collect the stolen item for them, and he is no longer a bailee. In this case, <b>the thief did not become exempt through</b> his <b>admission</b> to the <b>bailee.</b>
<b>Rava raises a dilemma</b> concerning the previous ruling: If a bailee <b>rose to take a false oath but</b> the owner <b>did not let him, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Should he be considered as one who had taken a false oath, as that was his intention, and he is no longer a bailee; or, since he never actually took the false oath, he is still a bailee? The Gemara comments: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Kahana</b> would <b>teach</b> Rava’s question <b>like this,</b> as quoted above. <b>Rav Tavyumei</b> would <b>teach</b> Rava’s question differently: <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If he actually <b>took a false oath, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he still a bailee or not? The Gemara comments: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
The Gemara relates another dilemma concerning the status of a bailee and stolen deposits: If the <b>owners</b> of a deposit <b>demanded from a bailee</b> that he return their deposit <b>and</b> he <b>paid</b> them instead of taking an oath, <b>and</b> then <b>the thief was recognized,</b> and <b>the owners demanded of</b> the thief to pay <b>and he admitted</b> to having stolen it; and then the <b>bailee demanded of</b> the thief to pay <b>and he denied</b> the claim, <b>and</b> the bailee <b>brought witnesses</b> that he had stolen it, did <b>the thief become exempt</b> from double payment <b>through</b> his <b>admission</b> to the <b>owners,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> when one admits liability to a penalty, <b>or not?</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Do we say</b> that the <b>bailee can say to the owners: Once you took your money</b> from me <b>you removed yourselves from here</b> and have no further connection to this deposit. Therefore, I am now considered the owner of the stolen item and the right to the double payment is mine, and the thief’s admission to you is meaningless. <b>Or perhaps</b> the owners <b>can say to him: Just as you performed a service for us</b> by paying us when you were not obligated, <b>we performed</b> a service <b>for you as well.</b> Instead of granting acquisition of the double payment to you, to enable you to be repaid <b>we took the trouble</b> to search <b>after the thief. We will take</b> what is <b>ours,</b> i.e., the stolen item, <b>and you take</b> what is <b>yours,</b> the money you paid us. The Gemara comments: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ It <b>was stated:</b> If an animal given as a deposit <b>was stolen in circumstances beyond the control</b> of the bailee, who is therefore exempt from liability regardless of whether he was paid, <b>and the thief was recognized, Abaye says: If he is an unpaid bailee,</b> then if <b>he</b> so <b>desires</b> he can choose to <b>enter</b> into <b>judgment with</b> the thief, i.e., the bailee will pay the owner and then get reimbursed by the thief; and if <b>he</b> so <b>desires</b> he can <b>take an oath</b> that he was not responsible and the owner can demand his money from the thief. <b>If he is a paid bailee he enters</b> into <b>judgment with</b> the thief <b>and does not</b> have the option to <b>take an oath</b> to become exempt, as the responsibility to collect payment from the thief is part of his duty as a paid bailee. <b>Rava says: Whether this</b> unpaid bailee <b>or that</b> paid bailee <b>enters</b> into <b>judgment with</b> the thief, <b>he does not</b> have the option to <b>take an oath.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that Rava <b>disagrees with</b> the ruling <b>of Rav Huna bar Avin? As Rav Huna bar Avin sent</b> this ruling: If an animal given as a deposit <b>was stolen in circumstances beyond the control</b> of the bailee <b>and the thief was recognized, if he is an unpaid bailee,</b> then if <b>he</b> so <b>desires</b> he can choose to <b>enter</b> into <b>judgment with</b> the thief; and if <b>he</b> so <b>desires</b> he can <b>take an oath</b> that he was not responsible, and the owner can demand his money from the thief. <b>And if he is a paid bailee,</b> then <b>he enters</b> into <b>judgment with</b> the thief <b>and does not</b> have the option to <b>take an oath.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> it happened <b>that first</b> the bailee <b>took an oath,</b> before the thief was recognized. The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But</b> Rav Huna bar Avin <b>says:</b> If <b>he</b> so <b>desires</b> he can choose to <b>enter</b> into <b>judgment with</b> the thief; and if <b>he</b> so <b>desires</b> he can <b>take an oath</b> that he was not responsible, indicating that the bailee had not yet taken an oath. The Gemara answers: Rather, <b>this is</b> what Rav Huna bar Avin <b>is saying:</b> Having first taken an oath before the thief was recognized, if <b>an unpaid bailee</b> so <b>desires</b> he can <b>remain with his oath</b> and not pay the owner, and if he so <b>desires</b> he can choose to <b>enter</b> into <b>judgment with</b> the thief.
<b>Rabba Zuti raises the dilemma like this:</b> If an animal given as a deposit <b>was stolen in circumstances beyond the control</b> of the bailee, <b>and</b> the <b>thief returned</b> the animal to the place from where he had stolen it, and it is now <b>in the house of the bailee, and it</b> then <b>died through</b> the bailee’s <b>negligence, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>once it was stolen in circumstances beyond</b> the bailee’s <b>control his guardianship is completed</b> and he has no more responsibility for the animal, even for subsequent negligence? <b>Or perhaps once it</b> was <b>returned, it returned to his guardianship,</b> and an unpaid bailee is liable for loss resulting from negligence? The Gemara comments: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the owner asked the bailee: <b>Where is my deposit?</b> And the bailee <b>said to him:</b> It was <b>lost.</b> And the owner said: <b>I administer an oath to you, and</b> the bailee <b>said: Amen,</b> therefore accepting the oath; <b>and the witnesses testify about</b> the bailee <b>that he consumed it,</b> then he must <b>pay</b> the <b>principal.</b> If the bailee <b>admitted on his own</b> that he had taken a false oath, then he must <b>pay</b> the <b>principal and</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering.</b>
If the owner asked the bailee: <b>Where is my deposit,</b> and the bailee <b>said to him: It was stolen;</b> and the owner said: <b>I administer an oath to you, and</b> the bailee <b>said: Amen,</b> therefore accepting the oath; <b>and the witnesses testify about</b> the bailee <b>that he stole it,</b> he must <b>pay</b> the <b>payment of double</b> the principal. If the bailee <b>admitted on his own</b> that he had taken a false oath, then he must <b>pay the principal,</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and</b> bring <b>a guilt-offering.</b>
The mishna continues: In the case of <b>one who robs his father</b> and the father demands that he return the stolen item, <b>and he takes an oath to</b> his father that he did not rob him; <b>and</b> then the father <b>dies;</b> and then the son admits that he robbed him and took a false oath, necessitating the return of the principal and the giving of the additional one-fifth payment to his father’s heirs, of which he is either one of several or the only one; what should he do? <b>This</b> son <b>pays</b> the <b>principal and</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>to his</b> father’s <b>sons or brothers, and</b> brings <b>a guilt-offering</b> and does not keep his own share. <b>And if he does not want</b> to forfeit his share <b>or where he does not have</b> sufficient funds to pay the other heirs while forfeiting his share, he <b>borrows</b> money in the amount of the value of the stolen item <b>and the creditors come and are repaid</b> in part from his share in the stolen item.
In the case of <b>one who says to his son</b> in a vow: It is forbidden <b>like an offering [<i>konam</i>],</b> and for that reason <b>you may not derive benefit from my property, if</b> the father then <b>dies</b> the son <b>inherits</b> from <b>him,</b> because it is no longer the father’s property once he dies.

Daf 109a

The mishna continues: If the father stated in his vow that his son may not derive benefit from his property <b>in his life and in his death,</b> then even <b>if</b> the father then <b>dies</b> the son <b>does not inherit</b> from <b>him,</b> as the prohibition is still in effect. <b>And</b> instead of taking his inheritance, <b>he returns</b> his portion in the estate <b>to his sons or to his brothers. And if he does not have</b> sufficient funds to subsist without his inheritance, he <b>borrows</b> money in the amount of the value of his share in the inheritance <b>and</b> the <b>creditors come and are repaid</b> from his share.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the <i>halakha</i> written in the mishna that one who robs his father pays the principal and the additional one-fifth payment to the father’s heirs, <b>Rav Yosef says:</b> One may <b>even</b> put this money <b>in a charity purse</b> if he so chooses. <b>Rav Pappa says: And</b> when giving the money <b>he must say: This</b> is what was <b>robbed</b> from <b>my father.</b>
§ The Gemara questions the mishna’s ruling that one who robs his father must return the stolen item to others even if he is the sole heir. <b>Why</b> must he do this? <b>Let him forgive</b> the debt <b>to himself;</b> as the heir, to whom payment is due, he should be able to forgive it. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (103a) that in the case of a robber who took a false oath claiming to be innocent and later admitted his liability: If the owner <b>forgave him concerning the principal, but did not forgive him concerning the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, he need not pursue him to repay the remaining debt. <b>Apparently,</b> even the principal <b>is subject to forgiveness,</b> so why doesn’t he forgive the obligation to himself?
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. That</b> mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> who says that this obligation can be forgiven, while <b>this</b> mishna, ruling that a son who robbed his father and is his sole heir cannot forgive the obligation to himself, is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> who holds that this obligation cannot be forgiven.
Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:16) that the verse states with regard to one who steals from one who then died: <b>“But if the man has no kinsman</b> to whom <b>restitution may be made for the guilt,</b> the restitution for guilt that is made shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s” (Numbers 5:8). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>But is there</b> any <b>Jewish person who has no kinsmen?</b> Since every Jew descends from Jacob our forefather, all Jews have relatives to inherit from them. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>the verse is speaking of robbery of a convert</b> who never married or had children as a Jew, and in any case is no longer legally related to his gentile family; he has no heirs. In this situation the Torah instructs one who robbed from a now-deceased convert to return the stolen item to a priest.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: In the case of one <b>who robbed a convert and took</b> a false <b>oath to him</b> saying that he did not rob him, <b>and</b> then <b>heard that the convert died; and he was bringing his money,</b> for the principal and the additional one-fifth payment, <b>and his guilt-offering up to Jerusalem</b> to pay his debt to the priests and sacrifice his offering, <b>and he encountered that same convert,</b> who in fact had not died; <b>and,</b> instead of having the robber pay the money right away the convert <b>established it as a loan for</b> the robber, <b>and</b> then the convert <b>died,</b> leaving his property ownerless, as he had no heirs; <b>this</b> robber <b>acquires</b> all <b>that</b> is <b>in his possession,</b> as it is now a loan, not money to pay back the theft; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The robber <b>has no remedy until he will remove his stolen item from his possession.</b>
Rabbi Yoḥanan explains their respective opinions. <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili,</b> there <b>is no difference</b> if the one to whom payment is due forgives the return of a stolen item <b>to himself,</b> such as in this case of a convert who died or in the case of the mishna where a son robbed his father who then died, and there <b>is no difference</b> if he forgives the return of a stolen item <b>to others.</b> In either case, he <b>can forgive</b> payment. <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> there <b>is no difference</b> if the one to whom payment is due forgives the return of a stolen item <b>to others</b> and there <b>is no difference</b> if he forgives the return of a stolen item <b>to himself.</b> In either case, he <b>cannot forgive</b> payment.
Rabbi Yoḥanan continues his analysis: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei</b> HaGelili, <b>the same is true,</b> i.e., the <i>halakha</i> would also be, <b>that</b> no liability would remain in the case of the convert <b>even had he not established</b> the robbery debt <b>as a loan,</b> as the robber could forgive the obligation to himself once the convert died. <b>And</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> its <i>halakha</i> in a case where he <b>established it as a loan for</b> the robber <b>is to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva: That even</b> if he <b>established it as a loan for him,</b> in which case it could be considered as though the robber had returned the stolen item and now has a standard loan debt, nevertheless, the robber <b>has no remedy until he will remove his stolen item from his possession,</b> so as to not benefit from his act of robbery.
<b>Rav Sheshet objects to this</b> interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>If so,</b> then <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, let</b> the mishna on 103a, which indicates that one can forgive the principal payment of a robbery, <b>teach us</b> instead that the robbery victim can forgive the obligation <b>to himself, and</b> it would be understood that <b>all the more so</b> one can forgive the obligation <b>to others.</b> And <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> which Rabbi Yoḥanan explains to be the opinion stated in the mishna here, <b>let it teach us that one cannot forgive</b> the obligation <b>to others, and</b> it would be understood <b>all the more so</b> with regard to the robber, <b>that</b> he <b>cannot forgive</b> the obligation <b>to himself.</b>
<b>Rather, Rav Sheshet said: That</b> mishna <b>and this</b> mishna are both in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. When Rabbi Yosei HaGelili is saying that one can forgive</b> the return of a stolen item, he meant specifically forgiving the obligation <b>to others, but</b> he <b>cannot forgive</b> the obligation <b>to himself.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if that is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>why did this</b> one who robbed a convert who subsequently died <b>acquire</b> all <b>that</b> is <b>in his possession? Because</b> the convert <b>established it as a loan for him,</b> and henceforth it is no longer considered stolen property, but a standard loan debt.
The Gemara offers a different explanation. <b>Rava said: That</b> mishna <b>and this</b> mishna are both in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. When Rabbi Akiva says that</b> he <b>cannot forgive</b> the return of a stolen item he meant specifically forgiving the obligation <b>to himself,</b> as in the case of the convert, <b>but</b> he <b>can forgive</b> the obligation <b>to others.</b>

Daf 109b

The Gemara questions Rava’s explanation: <b>By inference</b> does it follow <b>that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili holds</b> that he <b>can forgive</b> the return of the stolen item <b>even to himself? But</b> if so, payment for <b>robbery of a convert</b> who dies without heirs, about <b>which the Merciful One says</b> that it requires <b>giving</b> repayment <b>to the priests, how can you find these</b> circumstances if in every case where one robs a convert and the convert dies the robber can forgive the return of the item to himself?
<b>Rava said: With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where one robbed the convert and took an oath to him</b> that he did not rob him, <b>and</b> then <b>the convert died, and</b> the robber <b>admitted</b> his false oath <b>after</b> the convert’s <b>death,</b> such <b>that at the time that he admitted</b> to it, <b>the Name,</b> i.e., God, <b>acquired</b> the principal and the additional one-fifth payment <b>and gave it to the priests.</b> Once the right to the payment is transferred to the priests the robber can no longer forgive it. By contrast, if he admitted his false oath while the convert was still alive and then the convert dies, the convert can forgive the obligation to himself, since he already took ownership of it.
§ <b>Ravina raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to payment for <b>robbery of a female convert, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “But if the <b>man</b> has no kinsman” (Numbers 5:8), indicating that the <i>halakha</i> applies to a male convert, <b>but not</b> to <b>a woman,</b> i.e., a female convert; if she dies after being robbed, payment is not given to the priests. <b>Or perhaps it is the manner of the verse</b> to employ masculine wording, but the <i>halakha</i> applies in the case of a female convert as well?
<b>Rav Aharon said to Ravina: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to your dilemma, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states in its entirety: “But if the <b>man</b> has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt that is made shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him.” <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that it is referring to <b>a man; from where</b> is it derived that this applies equally to <b>a woman? When it states:</b> “The restitution for guilt <b>that is made,” there are two</b> instances of the phrase “that is made” <b>here,</b> as the verse mentions making restitution twice, to include a female convert in this <i>halakha</i>.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>If so, what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> specifically <b>“man”?</b> The <i>baraita</i> explains: To pay a convert who is <b>a man, you need to investigate concerning him</b> to determine <b>if he has a kinsman or not,</b> but to pay a convert who is <b>a minor you do not need to investigate concerning him. It is known that he has no kinsman,</b> since as a convert he has no kin among his birth family, and as a minor he does not have children.
§ With regard to the payment to priests in the case of one who robbed a convert who then died without heirs, <b>the Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “Restitution for guilt that is made <b>shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s”</b> (Numbers 5:8), teaching that <b>the Name,</b> i.e., God, <b>acquired it and gave it to the priest who is in that priestly watch.</b> Do <b>you say</b> that it is given only <b>to the priest who is on that priestly watch? Or</b> perhaps that is <b>not</b> the case, and <b>rather</b> he may give it <b>to any priest that he wishes? When it says</b> in that verse: <b>“Besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him,”</b> this teaches that <b>the verse speaks of</b> giving it <b>to the priest who is on that priestly watch.</b> Just as the ram that the robber brings is given only to the priest on duty who sacrifices it, so too, the money is also given only to the priest on duty.
Concerning this payment, <b>the Sages taught:</b> In a case <b>where</b> the one who <b>robs</b> the convert <b>was a priest, from where</b> is it derived <b>that he shall not say: Since</b> the payment usually <b>is removed</b> from the robber and given <b>to the priests and it is</b> now <b>in my possession, it should be mine. And</b> there is <b>a logical derivation</b> to support this reasoning, as follows: <b>If</b> a priest <b>has the right to acquire</b> the payment <b>belonging to others</b> who stole from a convert, then with regard to payment <b>belonging to himself,</b> which is already in his possession, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that he should keep it?
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Natan states</b> this logical inference <b>with different wording: And just as</b> with regard to <b>a matter in which</b> a priest <b>has no portion until it enters his possession,</b> e.g., <i>teruma</i>, which can be given to any priest, <b>once it enters his possession</b> another priest <b>cannot remove it from his possession;</b> so too, with regard to <b>a matter in which</b> a priest <b>has a portion</b> even <b>before it enters his possession,</b> e.g., an item stolen from a convert, in which he has a portion as one of the priests on the priestly watch, <b>isn’t it logical that another</b> priest <b>cannot remove it from his possession</b> once it is in his possession?
The <i>baraita</i> continues, countering that this logical inference is not correct: <b>No, if you said</b> this <b>concerning a matter in which</b> a priest <b>has no portion,</b> where the reason why once it enters his possession another priest cannot remove it from his possession is <b>that just as he has no portion in it, so too, others have no portion in it; would you say</b> the same <b>concerning</b> an item <b>robbed</b> from a convert? As there it could be said <b>that just as</b> the priest who robbed him <b>has a portion in it</b> as one of the priests on the priestly watch, <b>so too, other</b> priests on that watch <b>have a portion in it. Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>the item he stole is removed from his possession and is distributed to all of his brethren, the priests.</b>
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But isn’t it written: “And every man’s hallowed things shall be his;</b> whatsoever any man gives to the priest, it shall be his” (Numbers 5:10), indicating that a priest is not required to give to the other priests the offerings he sacrifices? Therefore, just as he has the right to the flesh of the guilt-offering that he brings to atone for robbing the convert, shouldn’t he also have the right to the payment? The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here,</b> in this case? We are dealing <b>with a ritually impure priest,</b> who is unfit to sacrifice the guilt-offering and therefore does not have rights to the flesh of the offering. In this case, he will not be able to keep the payment for himself.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> the <i>baraita</i> states its ruling specifically <b>with regard to an impure priest,</b> how can it describe the payment as <b>a matter in which</b> the priest <b>has a portion? Does he have</b> a portion in it? Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> must not be referring to an impure priest. <b>Rather,</b> there is another reason why he has no right to the payment. This <i>halakha</i> is <b>derived</b> through a verbal analogy between the phrase <b>“even the priest’s [<i>lakohen</i>]”</b> (Numbers 5:8) written in this context, and the phrase <b>“to the priest [<i>lakohen</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 27:21) <b>from</b> the verse stated concerning <b>an ancestral field,</b> which, if consecrated and then redeemed by another does not revert to its original owner in the Jubilee Year, but is given to the priests, as the <i>baraita</i> will now explain.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: “But the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy unto the Lord, as a field dedicated; the possession thereof shall be to the priest” (Leviticus 27:21). The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states</b> the term: <b>“The possession thereof”? From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> with regard to <b>a field that goes out to the priests in the Jubilee</b> Year <b>and one of the priests redeemed it</b> before the Jubilee Year, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> a priest <b>shall not say: Since</b> a field that is redeemed by another <b>goes out to the priests in the Jubilee</b> Year, <b>and</b> the field that I redeemed <b>is</b> now <b>in my possession, it should be mine,</b> and not be given to the priests in general?
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> there is <b>a logical derivation</b> to support this reasoning, as follows: If <b>I acquire</b> the field <b>belonging to others,</b> who consecrated it and it was then redeemed, then with regard to a field <b>belonging to me,</b> which is already in my possession, is it <b>not all the more so</b> that I should keep it?
The <i>baraita</i> continues, countering that this logical inference is not correct. <b>The verse states: “As a field dedicated; the possession thereof shall be to the priest”</b> (Leviticus 27:21), indicating that a field of which the priest has <b>possession</b> from his ancestors <b>is his, but this</b> field that he redeemed <b>is not his. How so?</b> It <b>is removed from his possession and is distributed to all of his brethren,the priests.</b>
§ The Gemara records another <i>baraita</i> concerning the rights of a priest to offerings he sacrifices. <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Menaḥot</i> 13:17): <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that a priest</b> may <b>come and sacrifice his offerings at any time and at any hour that he wishes</b> and does not have to wait for his priestly watch to serve in the Temple? <b>The verse states:</b> “And if a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel, where he sojourns, <b>and comes with all the desire of his soul</b> unto the place that the Lord shall choose; <b>then he shall minister</b> in the name of the Lord his God” (Deuteronomy 18:6–7).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that the performance of</b> the offering’s <b>service,</b> i.e., eating the meat of the animal he sacrifices, <b>and</b> the offering’s <b>hide, belong to him? The verse states: “And every man’s hallowed things shall be his”</b> (Numbers 5:10). <b>How so? If</b> this priest <b>was blemished, he gives</b> his offering <b>to</b> another <b>priest that is on the same priestly watch</b> as him to sacrifice it, <b>but the performance of its service and its hide belong to him.</b>

Daf 110a

The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And if he was old or sick,</b> so that he cannot perform the Temple service or eat from the offering, <b>he gives it to any priest he wishes</b> to sacrifice it, even to one not on his priestly watch, <b>and performance of its service and its hide</b> are given <b>to the members of the priestly watch.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this old or sick</b> priest? <b>If</b> he is in a condition <b>that he is able to perform</b> the Temple <b>service,</b> then <b>performance of its service and its hide should be his as well,</b> as the priest that sacrificed it was acting as his agent. <b>And if</b> he is in a condition <b>that he is not able to perform</b> the Temple <b>service, how can he appoint an agent?</b> The <i>baraita</i> stated that he may give it to any priest he wishes, indicating that he chooses which priest he will appoint as his agent.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he is able to do</b> it <b>with difficulty.</b> With regard to the Temple <b>service, where</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that if <b>he performs it with difficulty it is</b> still considered performance of the Temple <b>service,</b> he is therefore able to <b>appoint an agent</b> to do it for him. With regard to <b>eating</b> the offering, <b>where</b> the <i>halakha</i> says that <b>if he eats</b> it <b>with difficulty it is excessive eating, and excessive eating is nothing,</b> i.e., he does not thereby fulfill the mitzva to eat the sacrificial portion, he is not able to appoint an agent to eat it for him. <b>Due to that</b> reason, <b>performance of its service and its hide</b> are given <b>to the members of the priestly watch.</b>
<b>Rav Sheshet says: If a priest</b> of the priestly watch <b>was ritually impure,</b> then <b>with regard to a communal offering he gives it to any</b> priest <b>he wishes, and performance of its service and its hide</b> are given <b>to the members of the priestly watch.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> where this <i>halakha</i> applies? <b>If there are ritually pure</b> priests available, then <b>can impure ones perform</b> the Temple service, and by extension appoint an agent to perform it in their stead? <b>And if there are no ritually pure</b> priests there, as all members of the priestly watch are impure, is the <b>performance of its service and its hide</b> given <b>to the members of the priestly watch?</b> Even though communal offerings are sacrificed in such a circumstance, the priests <b>are impure and are not able</b> to <b>eat</b> the offering, even though they may sacrifice it.
<b>Rava said</b> in explanation: <b>Say</b> that they are given <b>to blemished</b> but <b>ritually pure</b> priests <b>who are on that priestly watch.</b> Even though blemished priests are disqualified from performing the Temple service and therefore the offering must be sacrificed by impure priests, the blemished priests are permitted to eat the sacrifice, as they are ritually pure.
<b>Rav Ashi says: If a High Priest was an acute mourner,</b> i.e., one whose immediate relative died on that day but had yet to be buried, and he had an offering to sacrifice on his own behalf, <b>he gives</b> the offering <b>to any priest that he wishes</b> to sacrifice it, <b>and performance of its service and its hide</b> are given <b>to the members of the priestly watch.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Ashi’s statement <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Zevaḥim</i> 11:3): <b>A High Priest may sacrifice</b> an offering even when he is <b>an acute mourner, but he does not eat</b> it during that day while he is an acute mourner <b>and does not</b> receive <b>a portion</b> of the sacrifice <b>to eat at night</b> after his acute mourning is finished. It follows from this <i>baraita</i> that since he sacrifices it by himself he is able to appoint another priest in his stead, and since he may not eat it, it is given to the priestly watch to eat. What, then, was the novelty of Rav Ashi’s statement?
The Gemara answers: It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>when the Merciful One had compassion on the High Priest,</b> permitting him to continue serving in the Temple even while in a state of acute mourning, it was for <b>him to sacrifice; but</b> with regard <b>to appointing an agent, he is not able</b> to <b>appoint</b> one. Therefore, Rav Ashi <b>teaches us</b> that he is able to appoint an agent, since he himself is permitted to perform the Temple service.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who robs a convert and takes a</b> false <b>oath</b> denying having done so, <b>and</b> then the convert <b>dies,</b> the robber, in order to achieve repentance, <b>pays</b> the <b>principal,</b> i.e., the stolen item or, if it is no longer extant, its monetary value, <b>and</b> an additional <b>one-fifth</b> of its value <b>to the priests, and</b> presents <b>a guilt-offering to the altar, as it is stated: “But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, the restitution for guilt that is made shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him”</b> (Numbers 5:8).
The mishna continues: If the robber <b>was bringing the money and the guilt-offering up</b> to Jerusalem <b>and he died</b> before paying the priests and bringing his offering, <b>the money shall be given to</b> the robber’s <b>children, and the</b> animal designated for the <b>guilt-offering shall graze until it becomes blemished</b> and consequently disqualified from being sacrificed. <b>And</b> the animal <b>shall</b> then <b>be sold and</b> the <b>money</b> received <b>for it shall be allocated for</b> communal <b>gift</b> offerings. If the robber <b>gave the money to the members of the priestly watch and</b> then <b>died</b> before they sacrificed his guilt-offering, <b>the heirs cannot remove</b> the money <b>from</b> the priests’ <b>possession, as it is stated:</b> “And every man’s hallowed things shall be his; <b>whatsoever any man gives to the priest, it shall be his”</b> (Numbers 5:10).
The mishna continues: If the robber <b>gave the money to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Joiarib and</b> then gave the <b>guilt-offering to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Jedaiah,</b> the following priestly watch, to sacrifice on his behalf, he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation. By contrast, if he first gave the <b>guilt-offering to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Joiarib and</b> then gave the <b>money to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Jedaiah, if</b> the animal designated for <b>the guilt-offering</b> is <b>extant,</b> then <b>members of</b> the priestly watch of <b>Jedaiah,</b> who received the money, <b>should sacrifice it. But if</b> it is <b>no</b> longer extant because the priestly watch of Joiarib had already sacrificed it, he <b>should return and bring another guilt-offering; for one who brings his stolen item</b> to the priests <b>before</b> he <b>brings his guilt-offering</b> has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation, but one who <b>brings his guilt-offering before</b> he <b>brings his stolen item</b> has <b>not fulfilled</b> his obligation.
Although he cannot sacrifice the offering before paying the principal, if <b>he gave the principal but did not</b> yet <b>give the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, the lack of having given <b>the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>does not preclude</b> sacrificing the offering.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in explanation of the verse cited in the mishna: “But if the man has no kinsman…the restitution for guilt that is made shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s” (Numbers 5:8): With regard to the word <b>“guilt,” this</b> is referring to the <b>principal,</b> i.e., the stolen item itself or its equivalent value; <b>“the restitution…that is made,” this</b> is referring to the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment. <b>Or</b> perhaps this is <b>not</b> the proper interpretation of the verse. <b>Rather,</b> it should be interpreted: <b>“Guilt,” this</b> is referring to the <b>ram</b> of the guilt-offering.
Before continuing the <i>baraita</i> the Gemara interrupts to clarify: <b>And for what purpose</b> does the <i>baraita</i> distinguish between the two interpretations of guilt, as in any event, both the principal and the guilt-offering must be brought? The Gemara explains: <b>To exclude that which Rava</b> holds, <b>as Rava says:</b> With regard to the <b>stolen item of a convert that</b> the robber <b>returned at night,</b> the robber <b>did not fulfill</b> his obligation. And similarly, if <b>he returned it to him</b> in <b>halves,</b> he <b>did not fulfill</b> his obligation. <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One labeled</b> the stolen item with the term <b>“guilt,”</b> teaching that just as a guilt-offering cannot be offered at night or in halves, so too, the stolen item cannot be returned at night or in halves.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>When it says</b> in that verse: <b>“Besides the ram of the atonement”</b> (Numbers 5:8), referring to the offering, <b>you must say</b> concerning the word <b>“guilt”</b> written earlier in the verse that <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>principal.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the word <b>“guilt,” this</b> is referring to the <b>principal; “the restitution…that is made,” this</b> is referring to the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment. <b>Or</b> perhaps this is <b>not</b> the proper interpretation of the verse. <b>Rather,</b> it should be interpreted: <b>“Guilt,” this</b> is referring to the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment. Before continuing the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara interrupts to clarify: <b>For what purpose</b> does the <i>baraita</i> distinguish between the two interpretations? The Gemara explains: <b>To exclude</b> that which <b>the mishna</b> teaches, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna: If he <b>gave him the principal but did not</b> yet <b>give him the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, the lack of having given <b>the</b> additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>does not preclude</b> sacrificing the offering. If “guilt” is referring to the additional one-fifth payment, then, <b>on the contrary,</b> it would follow that the lack of having given the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>precludes</b> sacrificing the offering.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>When it says</b> in the previous verse: <b>“And he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and</b> add unto it <b>the fifth part thereof”</b> (Numbers 5:7), <b>you must say</b> concerning the word <b>“guilt”</b> that <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>principal.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the word <b>“guilt,” this</b> is referring to the <b>principal; “the restitution…that is made,” this</b> is referring to the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment, <b>and the verse is speaking of robbery of a convert. Or</b> perhaps this is <b>not</b> the proper interpretation of the verse. <b>Rather,</b> it should be interpreted: <b>“The restitution…that is made,” this</b> is referring to <b>double payment</b> that a thief must pay, <b>and the verse is speaking of theft from a convert. When it says</b> in the previous verse: <b>“And he shall make restitution for his guilt in full, and</b> add unto it <b>the fifth part thereof”</b> (Numbers 5:7), <b>the verse is speaking of money that is paid</b> exactly <b>according to the principal,</b> and not double payment.
§ Having quoted Rava’s statement, the Gemara returns to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rava says:</b> With regard to the <b>stolen item of a convert that</b> the robber <b>returned at night,</b> the robber <b>did not fulfill</b> his obligation. And similarly, if <b>he returned it to him</b> in <b>halves,</b> he <b>did not fulfill</b> his obligation. <b>What is the reason? The Merciful One labeled</b> the stolen item with the term <b>“guilt,”</b> teaching that just as a guilt-offering cannot be offered at night or in halves, so too, the stolen item cannot be returned at night or in halves.
<b>And Rava says:</b> With regard to the <b>stolen item of a convert that does not have the value of one <i>peruta</i> for each and every priest</b> on the priestly watch, the robber <b>did not fulfill his obligation</b> by giving it to the priestly watch. <b>What is the reason? As it is written: “The restitution for guilt that is made,”</b> meaning that the robber has not fulfilled his obligation to return the stolen item <b>until there will be</b> halakhically significant <b>restitution made to each and every priest,</b> minimally one <i>peruta</i>. If the stolen item was of less value than can be distributed with each priest in the watch receiving at least one <i>peruta</i>, the robber must add to the payment so that each priest receives one <i>peruta</i>.
Based on this <i>halakha</i>, <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> If the stolen item <b>does not have</b> the value of one <i>peruta</i> <b>for</b> each priest on <b>the priestly watch of Joiarib,</b> which had many priests, <b>but it has</b>

Daf 110b

the value of one <i>peruta</i> <b>for</b> each priest on the <b>priestly watch of Jedaiah,</b> which had fewer priests, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> with regard to which Rava raised his dilemma? <b>If we say</b> that the dilemma is raised in a case <b>where he gave</b> the money <b>to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Jedaiah, during</b> the time of the Temple service of the <b>priestly watch of Jedaiah,</b> there would be no dilemma. <b>There is in</b> this payment enough value for each priest to receive one <i>peruta</i>.
The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to raise the dilemma in a case <b>where he gave it to</b> the <b>Jedaiah</b> priestly watch <b>during</b> the time of the Temple service of the <b>priestly watch of Joiarib;</b> in that case, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains the two possibilities: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since it is not</b> during Jedaiah’s <b>priestly watch, it is nothing,</b> i.e., it is not a fulfillment of the mitzva to return the stolen item? <b>Or perhaps</b> we say that <b>since it was not fit for</b> the Joiarib priestly watch, as it was of insufficient value, <b>from the outset it stands</b> ready <b>for</b> the <b>Jedaiah</b> priestly watch, and by giving it to them he fulfilled the mitzva? The Gemara comments: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rava raises</b> another <b>dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>priests, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>whether they may divide</b> among themselves the restitution for <b>robbery of a convert,</b> with some priests taking a larger share <b>in exchange for</b> taking a smaller share in the restitution for another <b>robbery of a convert?</b> In other words, can the priests arrange that one priest or several priests will receive the restitution for one robbery and another priest or several priests will receive the restitution for a different robbery another time?
He explains the two possibilities: <b>Do we say</b> that <b>the Merciful One labeled</b> the stolen item with the term <b>“guilt,”</b> and therefore, <b>just as</b> with <b>a guilt-offering</b> the priests <b>may not divide</b> portions of <b>a guilt-offering,</b> with some priests taking a larger share <b>in exchange for</b> taking a smaller share in other portions of <b>a guilt-offering,</b> but rather all priests of the watch share in the sacrificial flesh, <b>so too</b> with the restitution for <b>robbery:</b> The priests <b>may not divide</b> the restitution for <b>robbery of a convert,</b> with some priests taking a larger share <b>in exchange for</b> taking a smaller share in the restitution for another <b>robbery of a convert? Or perhaps</b> the restitution for <b>robbery of a convert</b> paid to priests is not in fact an offering, but it <b>is monetary restitution,</b> and monetary restitution may be divided in this manner among the priests?
Rava <b>then resolves it</b> himself: <b>The Merciful One labeled</b> the stolen item with the term <b>“guilt,”</b> so it may not be divided in this manner. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, teaches it explicitly</b> as a ruling, and not as a dilemma and solution, that <b>Rava says: Priests may not divide</b> the restitution for <b>robbery of a convert</b> with some priests taking a larger share <b>in exchange for</b> taking a smaller share in the restitution for another <b>robbery of a convert. What is the reason? The Merciful One labeled</b> the stolen item with the term <b>“guilt.”</b>
§ <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> What is the status of <b>priests with regard to</b> the restitution for <b>robbery of a convert? Are they</b> considered <b>heirs</b> of the convert <b>or are they recipients of gifts?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference?</b> The Gemara answers: The difference would be in a case <b>where one robbed</b> a convert of <b>leavened bread, and</b> then <b>Passover elapsed over it,</b> rendering it an item from which one is prohibited to derive benefit and therefore valueless. <b>If you say</b> that the priests <b>are heirs, this is what they inherit:</b> Only that which the robber <b>bequeaths</b> to them, and the priests receive the valueless leavened bread as is. <b>And if you say</b> that <b>they are recipients of gifts,</b> it is <b>a gift that the Merciful One is saying that</b> the robber <b>should give to them, and this</b> robber <b>is not giving them anything, for it is merely dust.</b> Therefore, the robber should have to pay the priests what the value of the bread had been at the time of the robbery.
<b>Rav Zeira raises the dilemma like this: Even if you say</b> that <b>they are recipients of gifts, this</b> question, i.e., whether a robber of leavened bread over which Passover then elapsed fulfills the mitzva to return the stolen item even in this devalued state, <b>is not our dilemma,</b> as this is certainly a fulfillment of the obligation. <b>For this</b> stolen item is the <b>gift</b> with regard to which <b>the Merciful One states</b> in the Torah <b>that</b> the robber <b>should give</b> it <b>to</b> the priests.
Rav Zeira continues: <b>Rather, when we have a dilemma</b> whether the priests are considered as heirs or as recipients of gifts, the practical difference arises in a case <b>where ten animals came into</b> the priest’s possession <b>for</b> payment of <b>robbery of a convert.</b> The dilemma is: <b>Are they obligated to separate tithe from them, or not?</b>
The Gemara explains the two possibilities: Perhaps <b>they are heirs,</b> in which case they will be obligated, <b>for the Master said</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 56b) that if heirs <b>acquired</b> animals <b>in</b> the jointly <b>held</b> property <b>of the estate,</b> i.e., the heirs jointly owned the animals as the inheritance had yet to be divided, <b>they are obligated</b> to separate tithes from animals born to those animals, and the same will apply to the priests. <b>Or perhaps they are recipients of gifts, and we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 55b): <b>One who purchases</b> an animal <b>or one who</b> has an animal <b>given to him as a gift</b> is <b>exempt from</b> the obligation to separate the <b>animal tithe,</b> and the same will apply to the priests. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case?
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ḥalla</i> 2:7–10): <b>Twenty-four priestly gifts were given to Aaron and to his sons, and all of them were given with</b> a derivation from <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization; and</b> with <b>a covenant of salt.</b> The verses in the book of Numbers, chapter 18, detail the gifts of the priesthood. The first verse (18:8) is written in general terms, followed by verses listing the actual gifts (9–18), followed by a final verse written in general terms. The method of interpreting verses written in this manner is one of the thirteen hermeneutical principles. Additionally, the phrase: “Covenant of salt,” is written in the final verse (18:19), and is referring to all of the gifts of the priesthood.
This serves to teach that <b>anyone who fulfills</b> the mitzva of giving the gifts of the priesthood is considered <b>as if he fulfills</b> the entire Torah, which is interpreted using the principle of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization; and</b> as if he has brought all of the offerings, concerning which there is <b>a covenant of salt. And anyone who violates</b> the mitzva of giving the gifts of the priesthood is considered <b>as if he violates</b> the entire Torah, which is interpreted using the principle of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization; and</b> as if he has not brought all of the offerings, concerning which there is <b>a covenant of salt.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And these are</b> the twenty-four gifts: There are <b>ten in the Temple, and four in Jerusalem, and ten in the boundaries</b> of Eretz Yisrael. The <b>ten</b> gifts that the priests consume only <b>in the Temple</b> are <b>an animal sin-offering; and a bird sin-offering; and a definite guilt-offering; and a provisional guilt-offering; and communal peace-offerings,</b> i.e., lambs offered on <i>Shavuot</i>; <b>and a <i>log</i> of oil</b> that accompanies the guilt-offering <b>of</b> a recovered <b>leper; and the surplus of the <i>omer</i>,</b> i.e., what remains of the measure of barley brought as a communal offering on the sixteenth of Nisan; <b>and the two loaves,</b> i.e., the public offering of two loaves from the new wheat offered on <i>Shavuot</i>; <b>and the shewbread; and the leftovers of grain-offerings,</b> after the priests have offered the required handful.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> the <b>four</b> gifts that the priests consume anywhere <b>in Jerusalem: The firstborn</b> of kosher animals; <b>and the first fruits; and the</b> portions <b>separated</b> for the priests <b>from the thanks-offering and the nazirite’s ram; and hides of consecrated</b> animals.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And ten</b> gifts that the priests consume anywhere <b>in the boundaries</b> of Eretz Yisrael: <b><i>Teruma</i>,</b> i.e., the portion of the produce designated for the priest; <b>and <i>teruma</i> of the tithe,</b> which the Levite separates from the tithe he receives and gives to a priest; <b>and <i>ḥalla</i>,</b> i.e., the portion of dough of the five main grains designated for the priest; <b>and the first of the sheared</b> wool; <b>and the gifts</b> of non-sacrificial, slaughtered animals, namely, the right foreleg, the cheeks, and the maw; <b>and</b> money given for the <b>redemption of</b> the firstborn <b>son; and</b> a sheep or goat given as <b>redemption of the firstborn donkey; and</b> a consecrated <b>ancestral field</b> the priests receive in the Jubilee Year; <b>and a dedicated field; and</b> payment for <b>robbery of a convert</b> who died without heirs.
The Gemara infers from the wording of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> this <i>baraita</i>, <b>in any event, labels</b> the payment for robbery of a convert <b>a gift.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that the priests who receive it <b>are</b> considered <b>recipients of gifts,</b> and not heirs. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is so.
§ The mishna teaches: If he <b>gave the money to the members of the priestly watch</b> and then died before they sacrificed his guilt-offering, the heirs cannot remove the money from the priests’ possession. <b>Abaye said: Learn from</b> this mishna that <b>monetary restitution</b> for the robbery <b>atones</b> for <b>half</b> of the sin, <b>for if</b> it <b>does not atone</b> at all, and atonement is not achieved until the guilt-offering is sacrificed, <b>I would say</b> that in the case of robbery of a convert, if the guilt-offering is not brought the priest <b>returns</b> the money <b>to the</b> robber’s <b>heirs. What is the reason</b> I would say this? Because <b>he did not give</b> the money <b>to</b> the priests <b>with this intention</b> of giving the money and not achieving atonement at all, and it would be a mistaken transaction.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> it would follow that <b>a sin-offering whose owners have died,</b> leaving no one to bring the offering, <b>should be transferred to non-sacred</b> status, <b>as</b> the robber <b>did not separate</b> the animal as an offering <b>with this intention</b> of its not being sacrificed to atone for his sin. The Sages <b>say</b> in response: In the case of <b>a sin-offering whose owners have died,</b> the Sages <b>learned this <i>halakha</i> through tradition that</b> the animal <b>is left to die.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, a guilt-offering whose owner has died should be transferred to non-sacred</b> status, <b>as</b> the owner <b>did not separate</b> the animal as an offering <b>with this intention</b> of it not being sacrificed to atone for his sin. The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>a guilt-offering,</b> the Sages <b>also learned this <i>halakha</i> through tradition: Any</b> occurrence <b>that,</b> if it occurs <b>with regard to a sin-offering</b> the animal is placed in isolation for it to <b>die,</b> if it occurs <b>with regard to a guilt-offering</b> the animal is left to <b>graze</b> until it develops a blemish precluding its use as an offering, at which point it can be redeemed.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then in the case of <b>a woman whose husband died childless [<i>yevama</i>], who happened before</b> her late husband’s brother who was <b>afflicted with boils</b> to enter levirate marriage with him, <b>should go out</b> free to marry <b>without</b> being required to perform <b>the ritual through which the <i>yavam</i> frees the <i>yevama</i> of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>]. For she did not betroth herself</b> to this man’s deceased brother <b>with this intention</b> of having a levirate bond with a man afflicted with boils. The Gemara answers: <b>There, it is clear to us</b>

Daf 111a

<b>that it is satisfactory for her to</b> have <b>any</b> kind of marital arrangement, and even had she taken into consideration the possibility of entering a levirate bond with this <i>yavam</i> who is afflicted with boils she still would have accepted betrothal to her husband. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Reish Lakish, as Reish Lakish says</b> that women have a saying: <b>It is better to sit</b> as <b>two bodies [<i>tan du</i>],</b> i.e., to be married, <b>than to sit</b> lonely like <b>a widow.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: If the robber <b>gave the money to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Joiarib</b> and then gave the guilt-offering to the priestly watch of Jedaiah, the following priestly watch, to sacrifice on his behalf, he has fulfilled his obligation. By contrast, if he first gave the guilt-offering to the priestly watch of Joiarib and then gave the money to the priestly watch of Jedaiah, if the guilt-offering is extant, then members of the priestly watch of Jedaiah, who received the money, should sacrifice it. The Gemara quotes a <i>baraita</i> that records a dispute between <i>tanna’im</i> concerning this case. <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:18): If the robber <b>gave the guilt-offering to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Joiarib and</b> then gave <b>the money to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Jedaiah,</b> they <b>should return the money</b> to be <b>with the guilt-offering,</b> i.e., with the priestly watch of Joiarib; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And the Rabbis say</b> the opposite: They <b>should return the guilt-offering</b> to be <b>with the money,</b> and the priestly watch of Jedaiah will sacrifice it.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this dispute? <b>If we say that he gave the guilt-offering to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Joiarib during the priestly watch of Joiarib and the money to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Jedaiah during the priestly watch of Jedaiah,</b> then <b>this</b> one <b>acquired that which belongs to it and that</b> one <b>acquired that which belongs to it.</b> Why would the court remove what was given lawfully to the priestly watch?
<b>Rava said: With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he gave the guilt-offering to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Joiarib during the priestly watch of Joiarib and the money to</b> the priestly watch of <b>Jedaiah</b> also <b>during the priestly watch of Joiarib,</b> and the dispute is as follows: <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>since this is not the priestly watch of Jedaiah, we penalize Jedaiah; therefore,</b> the priestly watch of Jedaiah must <b>return the money</b> in their possession <b>to be with the guilt-offering</b> held by the Joiarib watch. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>the members of</b> the priestly watch of <b>Joiarib acted unlawfully when they accepted the guilt-offering before</b> the robber paid <b>the money,</b> since payment for the robbery must be given before the guilt-offering can be offered. <b>Therefore, we penalize them, and the guilt-offering</b> in their possession <b>returns</b> to be <b>with the money</b> held by the Jedaiah watch.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> on this topic (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:18): <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: According to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> that if during the Joiarib watch the robber gave the guilt-offering to the Joiarib watch and the money to the Jedaiah watch, the money should return to the priestly watch of Joiarib, <b>if the members of</b> the priestly watch of <b>Joiarib went first and sacrificed the guilt-offering</b> before receiving the money from the priestly watch of Jedaiah, then the robber <b>should go back and bring another guilt-offering, and the members of</b> the priestly watch of <b>Jedaiah,</b> who are already in possession of the money, <b>should offer it, and those</b> members of the priestly watch of Joiarib <b>acquired that</b> offering <b>that is in their possession.</b>
The Sages <b>say: For what</b> purpose is that offering <b>useful? It is a disqualified guilt-offering,</b> since it was sacrificed before the payment for the robbery was given, and had to be entirely burned on the altar. <b>Rava said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> acquiring <b>its hide,</b> which the members of the priestly watch of Joiarib keep.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: According to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, if the guilt-offering is</b> still <b>extant,</b> i.e., if the priestly watch of Joiarib did not already sacri-fice it, then the priestly watch of Joiarib <b>should return the guilt-offering</b> to be <b>with the money,</b> and the priestly watch of Jedaiah will sacrifice it.
The Gemara questions this: <b>But Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that they <b>should return</b> the <b>money</b> to be <b>with the guilt-offering.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where</b> it happened <b>that the priestly watch of Joiarib exited</b> at the close of their Temple service <b>and they did not demand</b> the money from the priestly watch of Jedaiah. <b>And this</b> statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>teaches us this: That</b> by doing so, the members of the priestly watch of Joiarib <b>waived</b> their rights to the money <b>in favor of</b> the priestly watch of Jedaiah. Consequently, they are required to give the guilt-offering to the priestly watch of Jedaiah to sacrifice.
<b>It is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: According to the statement of Rabbi Yehuda, if the guilt-offering is</b> still <b>extant,</b> i.e., if the priestly watch of Joiarib did not already sacrifice it, <b>the money</b> must <b>return</b> to be <b>with the guilt-offering.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious? This is</b> what Rabbi Yehuda <b>holds</b> explicitly; what novelty did Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi teach?
The Gemara explains: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> With a case <b>where</b> it happened <b>that the priestly watch of these and of those,</b> i.e., both Joiarib and Jedaiah, <b>exited</b> at the end of their Temple service, <b>and they did not demand</b> of the other the item in possession of the other watch. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>they waived</b> their rights <b>in favor of each other,</b> so that the money stays in possession of the Jedaiah watch, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>teaches us that we say: Since</b> the Jedaiah watch <b>did not demand</b> the guilt-offering from the Joiarib watch after the latter exited, <b>let them go back to the first,</b> standard scenario, returning the money to Joiarib to be with the guilt-offering.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>For one who brings his stolen item</b> to the priests <b>before he brings his guilt-offering</b> has fulfilled his obligation, but one who brings his guilt-offering before he brings his stolen item has not fulfilled his obligation. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rava said:</b> This is <b>as the verse states:</b> “But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, <b>the restitution for guilt that is made shall be the Lord’s, even the priest’s; besides the ram of the atonement, whereby atonement shall be made for him”</b> (Numbers 5:8). Learn <b>by inference that the money</b> must be returned <b>first,</b> before the guilt-offering is brought.
Having understood that the inference is that the wording “besides the ram of the atonement” indicates that the ram must be brought after the money is given, <b>one of the Sages said to Rava: If that is so,</b> then in a different verse, which states concerning the additional offerings sacrificed on the first day of Passover: “You shall offer these <b>besides the burnt-offering of the morning,</b> which is for a continual burnt-offering” (Numbers 28:23), <b>so too</b> should one learn <b>by inference that the additional offerings</b> are brought <b>first,</b> before the morning burnt-offering?
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that no</b> sacrifice <b>shall precede the daily morning offering? The verse states:</b> “And the fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not be extinguished; and the priest shall kindle wood upon it every morning, and <b>he shall prepare the burnt-offering upon it</b> and shall cause the fats of the peace-offerings to go up in smoke upon it” (Leviticus 6:5). <b>And Rava says: “The burnt-offering,”</b> with the definite article, is referring to <b>the first burnt-offering,</b> i.e., the daily morning offering, which is first both chronologically and in terms of importance.
Rava <b>said to him:</b> I do not hold that the <i>tanna</i> derives this <i>halakha</i> from the wording of: “Besides the ram of the atonement,” but <b>I</b> hold that the <i>tanna</i> <b>derives it from</b> the phrase in the same verse: <b>“Whereby atonement shall be made for him”</b> (Numbers 5:8), which is written in the future tense, indicating that he will achieve atonement in the future by bringing the ram of atonement, <b>but</b> as of now, when he is giving payment for the robbery, the offering <b>did not yet atone</b> for his sin.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>he gave the principal to him</b> but did not yet give the additional one-fifth payment, his not giving it does not preclude sacrificing the offering. The Gemara now clarifies the source of this <i>halakha</i>. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> on the topic of the guilt-offering brought by one who misuses consecrated property, which is accompanied by repayment of the value of the item and an additional fifth of its value: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that if he brought his</b> payment for his benefit from <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>but did not bring his guilt-offering,</b> or if he brought <b>his guilt-offering but did not bring his</b> payment for his benefit from <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>that he did not fulfill</b> his obligation?
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>The verse states: “With the ram of the guilt-offering [<i>ha’asham</i>], and he shall be forgiven”</b> (Leviticus 5:16). The <i>baraita</i> interprets the phrase: “The ram of the guilt-offering,” to be referring to two entities: The ram, i.e., the offering, and the payment, represented by the words “the guilt-offering”; this teaches that forgiveness and atonement are achieved only after both the ram of the guilt-offering is sacrificed and the restitution of the monetary payment is given.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if he brought his guilt-offering before bringing his</b> payment for his benefit from <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>that he did not fulfill</b> his obligation? <b>The verse states: “With the ram of the guilt-offering,”</b> indicating that <b>the guilt-offering was already</b> brought.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>just as the ram and guilt-offering,</b> i.e., payment, <b>preclude</b> his achieving atonement, <b>so too,</b> payment of the additional <b>one-fifth</b> of the value <b>precludes</b> his achieving it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “With the ram of the guilt-offering, and he shall be forgiven,”</b> which teaches that <b>the ram and guilt-offering,</b> i.e., payment, <b>preclude</b> his achieving atonement <b>with regard to consecrated</b> property, <b>but</b> the payment of the additional <b>one-fifth does not preclude</b> his achieving it.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>And let</b> the <i>halakha</i> of misuse of <b>consecrated</b> property <b>be learned from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>common</b> money, i.e., payment for robbery of a convert who died without heirs, <b>and</b> let the <i>halakha</i> of <b>common</b> money be learned <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of misuse of <b>consecrated</b> property.
In what manner? The <i>halakha</i> of misuse of <b>consecrated</b> property can be learned <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>common</b> money as follows: <b>Just as</b> the word <b>“guilt” that is</b> written <b>there,</b> in the context of robbery of a convert, is referring to the <b>principal,</b> i.e., the payment itself, <b>so too,</b> the word <b>“guilt” that is</b> written <b>here,</b> in the context of misuse of consecrated property, is referring to the <b>principal. And</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>common</b> money can be learned <b>from</b> the <i>halakha</i> of misuse of <b>consecrated</b> property as follows: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of misuse of <b>consecrated</b> property the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>does not preclude</b> his achieving atonement, <b>so too,</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of <b>common</b> money <b>as well,</b> the additional <b>one-fifth</b> payment <b>does not preclude</b> his achieving atonement.

Daf 111b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who robs</b> another of food <b>and feeds</b> it to <b>his children, or</b> who <b>left</b> a stolen item <b>to them</b> and then died, the children <b>are exempt from paying</b> the victim of the robbery after their father’s death. But <b>if</b> the stolen item <b>was something that serves</b> as a legal <b>guarantee</b> of a loan, the heirs <b>are obligated to pay.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> If one <b>robbed</b> another, <b>and the owners</b> of the stolen item <b>have not</b> yet <b>despaired</b> of retrieving it, <b>and another</b> person <b>came,</b> took it <b>from</b> the robber <b>and ate it,</b> if the owner <b>wishes he may collect from this one,</b> i.e., the first robber, and if <b>he wishes he may collect from that one,</b> i.e., the second robber. <b>What is the reason</b> that he may collect from whomever he chooses? It is because <b>as long as the owners did not despair</b> of retrieving it, <b>it remains the possession of its owner,</b> so that when the second robber stole it from the first, he was in fact stealing from the original owner. Nevertheless, since the first robber was already obligated to return the item, his obligation remains in force and the owner may demand payment from him if he wishes.
The Gemara questions this opinion based on what <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: In the case of <b>one who robs</b> another of food <b>and feeds</b> it <b>to his children, or</b> one who <b>left</b> a stolen item <b>to them</b> as an inheritance, the children <b>are exempt from paying</b> the victim of the robbery after their father’s death. This appears to be <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b> who holds that one who steals from a thief is obligated to pay the owner. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> could have <b>said to you: When that</b> mishna <b>is taught,</b> it is addressing a case where it is <b>after</b> the owners had already <b>despaired</b> of retrieving the item, whereas Rav Ḥisda was referring to a case where the owners had not yet despaired.
§ The mishna stated that <b>if one left</b> a stolen item <b>to</b> his children as an inheritance, the children <b>are exempt from paying</b> the owner. <b>Rami bar Ḥama said: That is to say</b> that <b>the domain of an heir is comparable to the domain of a purchaser.</b> Just as an item that is purchased leaves the domain of the seller, an item that is inherited leaves the domain of the deceased and is considered the property of the heir. Since the owner has despaired of retrieving the item and the item has changed domains, it is entirely the property of the new owner, and he is exempt from payment.
<b>Rava</b> disagreed and <b>said</b> that <b>the domain of an heir is not comparable to the domain of a purchaser.</b> Consequently, the item has not undergone a complete change of ownership and the heir would be required to return it. <b>And</b> as for the explanation of the mishna, <b>here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where they</b> had already <b>consumed</b> the stolen goods, so there is nothing to return to the owner.
The Gemara questions the opinion of Rava: <b>From the fact</b> that <b>the latter clause teaches: If it was something that serves</b> as a legal <b>guarantee,</b> and is, therefore, an existing commodity, the heirs <b>are obligated to pay, it may be inferred that</b> in <b>the first clause we are</b> also <b>dealing with a stolen item that is extant.</b> This is contrary to Rava’s statement that the mishna is discussing stolen goods that have been consumed. The Gemara answers: <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>this is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying: If their father left them guaranteed property,</b> i.e., land, <b>they are obligated to pay</b> from that property, even if the stolen item is not extant.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>teach Rabbi Shimon, his son,</b> that this mishna is <b>not</b> referring only to <b>something that may actually serve</b> as a legal <b>guarantee,</b> i.e., land? <b>Rather,</b> it is referring <b>even</b> to <b>a cow</b> that <b>he plows with,</b> or <b>a donkey</b> that <b>he drives</b> by directing it from <b>behind,</b> which the heirs <b>are obligated to return because of the honor of their father.</b> This indicates that the mishna is referring to stolen property that is extant, and not to land.
<b>Rather, Rava said: When I die, Rabbi Oshaya will come toward me</b> from his place in heaven in order to greet me, <b>as I explain the mishna in accordance with his</b> opinion and thereby honor him. <b>As Rabbi Oshaya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case of <b>one who robs</b> another <b>and feeds</b> the stolen goods to <b>his children,</b> the latter <b>are exempt from paying</b> the owner. If <b>he left</b> a stolen item <b>to them</b> as an inheritance, if <b>the stolen item is extant,</b> the heirs <b>are obligated</b> to return it to the owner; if <b>it is not extant,</b> they <b>are exempt.</b> If <b>their father left them guaranteed property,</b> i.e., land, <b>they are obligated to pay</b> the owner. Rava explains the mishna as being consistent with the <i>baraita</i> of Rabbi Oshaya, although this explanation is not consistent with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s interpretation.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i> of Rabbi Oshaya. <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that if the <b>stolen item is not extant,</b> the heirs <b>are exempt</b> from payment. <b>Let us say that</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>is a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b> who says that heirs are obligated to pay for stolen goods that they consumed. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>when that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is referring to a case where it is <b>after</b> the owners had already <b>despaired</b> of retrieving the item, whereas Rav Ḥisda was referring to a case in which the owners had not yet despaired.
The Gemara continues: <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that if the <b>stolen item is extant,</b> the heirs <b>are obligated to pay. Let us say that</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>is a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Rami bar Ḥama,</b> since according to his understanding, the heirs should be exempt from payment because the stolen item is considered to have changed ownership when they inherited it. The Gemara answers: <b>Rami bar Ḥama</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>when that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b>

Daf 112a

it is referring to a case where it is <b>before</b> the owners have <b>despaired</b> of retrieving their property. Consequently, the heirs have not acquired the stolen property, and it must be returned.
<b>Rav Adda bar Ahava teaches that</b> statement <b>of Rami bar Ḥama</b> cited above <b>with regard to this</b> <i>baraita</i>: If <b>their father left them money</b> that he obtained by taking <b>interest,</b> which is prohibited, <b>even if they are aware that</b> the money <b>is</b> from <b>interest, they are not obligated to return</b> the money to the debtor who paid it. <b>Rami bar Ḥama said: That is to say</b> that <b>the domain of an heir is comparable to the domain of a purchaser,</b> and because the money has changed domains, the heirs have acquired it.
<b>Rava said: Actually, I will say to you</b> that <b>the domain of an heir is not comparable to the domain of a purchaser. And</b> the reason they do not have to return the money is because <b>it is different here, as the verse states: “Take no interest of him or increase,</b> but fear your God, that your brother may live with you” (Leviticus 25:36), which teaches that you must <b>return</b> the interest <b>to him so that he may live with you.</b> Since the interest is returned for this reason and not because it is considered stolen goods, it is apparent that <b>the Merciful One is cautioning him,</b> the lender, to return it, but <b>the Merciful One is not cautioning his son</b> to return it.
The Gemara points out: <b>The one who teaches</b> Rami bar Ḥama’s statement <b>with regard to the <i>baraita</i>,</b> i.e., Rav Adda bar Ahava, <b>all the more so</b> would apply it <b>to the mishna,</b> since there is no other explanation for why the heirs are exempt from payment. Conversely, according to <b>the one who teaches</b> Rami bar Ḥama’s statement <b>with regard to the mishna,</b> it is limited to that case. <b>But with regard to the <i>baraita</i>,</b> he holds that <b>Rami bar Ḥama teaches it as</b> explained by <b>Rava,</b> that the heirs are not exempt from payment because the domain of an heir is comparable to the domain of a purchaser, but rather because heirs are never required to return interest.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:21): With regard to <b>one who robs</b> another of food <b>and feeds</b> it to <b>his children,</b> the children <b>are exempt from paying</b> the owner. In a case where <b>he left</b> the stolen items <b>to them</b> as an inheritance, if the heirs are <b>adults they are obligated to pay,</b> and if they are <b>minors they are exempt from paying. If the adult</b> heirs <b>said: We do not know</b> what <b>calculations our father made with you</b> and whether he paid you for the stolen goods, <b>they are exempt.</b>
The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>Because they say: We do not know,</b> they are <b>exempt?</b> Since it is clear that they are in possession of stolen property, how can they be exempt due to the uncertain claim that perhaps their father repaid the owner after the theft? <b>Rava said</b> that the heirs are certain about their claim and that the <i>baraita</i> should be formulated differently, and <b>this is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> In the case of <b>adult</b> heirs <b>who said</b> to the claimant: <b>We know the calculations our father made with you and there is nothing of yours left with him,</b> as he paid his debt to you, they <b>are exempt.</b>
It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who robs</b> another of food <b>and feeds</b> it to <b>his children,</b> the children <b>are exempt from paying.</b> If <b>he left</b> stolen items <b>to them</b> as an inheritance <b>and they consumed them, whether they are adults or minors, they are obligated</b> to pay the owner. The Gemara asks: Are <b>minors obligated</b> to pay? <b>Let</b> it <b>be only</b> like a case <b>where one caused damage,</b> and a minor who causes damage is exempt. <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should be formulated differently, and <b>this is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> If <b>he left</b> the stolen items <b>to them</b> as an inheritance <b>and they did not yet consume them, whether they are adults or minors, they are obligated</b> to return the stolen items, since the items are still extant.
<b>Rava says:</b> In the case of children whose <b>father</b> died and <b>left them a cow</b> that he had <b>borrowed, they may use it for the entire duration of its loan.</b> Nevertheless, if it <b>died, they are not liable</b> to pay if its death was caused by <b>an unavoidable accident,</b> despite the fact that a borrower is liable for damage caused by an unavoidable accident. This is because liability for accidental damage pertains only to the actual borrower, i.e., the deceased father. If the children <b>thought that it</b> actually <b>belonged to their father and they slaughtered it and ate it, they</b> are liable to <b>pay</b> the owner <b>the value of inexpensive meat.</b> Rava adds: If <b>their father left them guaranteed property,</b> i.e., land, <b>they are liable to pay.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>Some teach this</b> final statement of Rava <b>with regard to the first clause,</b> which states that the heirs are exempt from payment for accidental damage. According to this interpretation, if the father left them land, they are obligated to pay for the cow if it dies due to unavoidable accident. <b>And some teach it with regard to the latter clause,</b> which states that heirs who slaughter and consume a cow must pay the owner the value of inexpensive meat. According to this interpretation, if the father left them land, they must pay for the full value of the cow.
<b>The one who teaches it with regard to the first clause</b> holds it to be true <b>all the more so with regard to the latter clause,</b> where the heirs actually consumed the meat themselves. <b>And,</b> accordingly, this understanding <b>differs</b> with the forthcoming opinion <b>of Rav Pappa.</b> By contrast, <b>the one who teaches it with regard to the latter clause</b> holds it to be true in that clause exclusively, <b>but with regard to the first clause,</b> it is <b>not</b> true. <b>And this is</b> consistent with the forthcoming opinion of <b>Rav Pappa.</b>
<b>As Rav Pappa says:</b> If <b>he had a stolen cow</b> in his possession, <b>and he slaughtered it on Shabbat,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>because he was already rendered liable</b> for the <b>theft before he came to</b> transgress the <b>Shabbat prohibition</b> of slaughtering an animal on Shabbat. But if <b>he had a borrowed cow</b> in his possession <b>and he slaughtered it on Shabbat,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from payment, <b>as</b> the transgression of <b>the Shabbat prohibition</b> of slaughtering an animal on Shabbat <b>and the prohibition against theft</b> occur <b>as one,</b> as the act of slaughter is tantamount to the theft of the animal. This indicates that according to Rav Pappa, a borrower’s liability to pay for accidental damage is initiated only when the damage is inflicted. Accordingly, in the case discussed by Rava, since the damage was not inflicted during the father’s lifetime, the deceased’s property was never liened to the cow’s owner, and consequently the heirs are not obligated to pay for any accidental damage.
After having cited two <i>baraitot</i> that express different opinions with regard to the obligation of heirs to pay for property stolen by their deceased father, the Gemara cites a third <i>baraita</i> that presents both opinions. <b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to the verse: “Then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, <b>that he shall restore the item that he robbed”</b> (Leviticus 5:23); <b>what</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states “that he robbed”?</b> It means that the robber must <b>return the same</b> item <b>that he robbed.</b>
<b>From here,</b> based on this exposition, the Sages <b>stated:</b> In a case of <b>one who robs</b> another of food <b>and feeds</b> it to <b>his children,</b> the children are <b>exempt from paying</b> the owner. If <b>he left</b> stolen goods <b>to them</b> as an inheritance, <b>whether they are adults or minors, they are obligated</b> to return the stolen goods. <b>They said in the name of Sumakhos:</b> If the heirs are <b>adults</b> they <b>are obligated,</b> but if they are <b>minors</b> they <b>are exempt.</b>
The Gemara recounts a related incident: <b>The son of Rabbi Yirmeya’s father-in-law,</b> i.e., his wife’s brother, who was a minor, <b>shut the doors</b> of his father’s house <b>before Rabbi Yirmeya</b> in order to prevent Rabbi Yirmeya from establishing legal possession of the house or a chamber that he claimed belonged to him. Rabbi Yirmeya <b>came before Rabbi Avin</b> to file a legal claim against his brother-in-law.
Rabbi Avin <b>said</b> to Rabbi Yirmeya: Your brother-in-law is <b>claiming</b> ownership of that which is <b>his,</b> since he retains the presumptive ownership of his father’s house upon his father’s death. Rabbi Yirmeya <b>said to him: But I can bring witnesses who can testify that I took possession of it during his father’s lifetime.</b> Rabbi Avin <b>said to him: But does</b> the court <b>accept witnesses</b>

Daf 112b

who testify <b>in the absence of a litigant?</b> Since the defendant is a minor his presence is not legally recognized, and the court does not accept testimony against him. Rabbi Yirmeya questioned this assertion: <b>And</b> is it so that the court does <b>not</b> accept such testimony? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> that if a robber leaves stolen goods to his children, <b>whether they are adults or minors, they are obligated</b> to pay the owner? If the court obligates minors to pay, it must accept testimony about them. Rabbi Avin <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Sumakhos’s dispute is at your side,</b> i.e., Sumakhos disagrees with this ruling and holds that the minors are exempt from paying. Rabbi Yirmeya <b>said</b> to him: <b>Did the whole world go to the effort to hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Sumakhos</b> in order <b>to seize what is mine?</b>
<b>In the meantime, the matter circulated and</b> eventually <b>came before Rabbi Abbahu,</b> who <b>said: Did you not hear that which Rav Yosef bar Ḥama says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya</b> says? <b>As Rav Yosef bar Ḥama says</b> that <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> With regard to <b>a child who took his slaves and descended into the field of another and said: It is mine,</b> the court <b>does not say: Let us wait until he matures</b> before we assess his claims. <b>Rather,</b> the court <b>removes it from his possession immediately, and when he matures he may bring witnesses</b> to attest to his claim <b>and we will see</b> how to judge the case. Similarly, Rabbi Yirmeya should be awarded the disputed property until his minor brother-in-law may litigate in court.
The Gemara rejects Rabbi Abbahu’s assertion: <b>Is</b> the case that Rav Yosef bar Ḥama discusses <b>comparable</b> to the case of Rabbi Yirmeya? <b>It is there,</b> in Rav Yosef bar Ḥama’s case, <b>that we seize</b> the property <b>from him, because there is no presumption</b> of ownership <b>from his father; but where he does have a presumption</b> of ownership <b>from his father, no,</b> we do not seize his property. Since Rabbi Yirmeya’s brother-in-law has a presumption of ownership due to the fact that the property belonged to his father, he retains control of the property.
§ Having mentioned the issue of testimony in the absence of a litigant, the Gemara discusses this matter in greater detail. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Shabbtai says:</b> The court <b>accepts witnesses</b> even <b>in the absence of a litigant. Rabbi Yoḥanan wondered at this</b> statement of Rav Ashi, and said: <b>Does</b> the court in fact <b>accept witnesses in the absence of a litigant?</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina received</b> the following guideline <b>from</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: The court accepts testimony in the absence of the defendant only in a case <b>where</b> the plaintiff <b>was ill, or his witnesses were ill, or his witnesses wished to travel overseas and</b> the judges <b>sent</b> for the defendant <b>and he did not come.</b> Since there is a concern that the plaintiff will not be able to present his claims at a later date, the testimony is accepted even in the absence of the defendant.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The court <b>accepts witnesses in the absence of a litigant. Mar Ukva said:</b> This statement <b>was explained to me</b> personally <b>by Shmuel himself,</b> and he said that it applies in a case <b>where</b> the court <b>opened his case and sent for him, but he did not appear. But</b> if it <b>did not</b> yet <b>open the case for him, he may say to</b> the plaintiff: <b>I am going to the High Court</b> to resolve this case and will not appear in the local court.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then even <b>when</b> the court already <b>opened</b> the case <b>for him, he</b> should <b>also</b> be <b>able</b> to <b>say to them: I am going to the High Court</b> to resolve this case. The Gemara answers that <b>Ravina said:</b> The defendant may not defer an opened case to the High Court if, <b>for example,</b> the local court <b>obtained a license from the High Court</b> authorizing it to adjudicate the case.
§ Having discussed testimony in the absence of a litigant, the Gemara addresses a similar matter. <b>Rav says:</b> The court <b>ratifies a document in the absence of a litigant. And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The court <b>does not ratify a document in the absence of a litigant. Rav Sheshet said to Rabbi Yosei bar Abbahu: I will explain Rabbi Yoḥanan’s reasoning to you. The verse states</b> with regard to an ox that gored: <b>“And warning has been given to its owner and he has not secured it”</b> (Exodus 21:29). <b>The Torah</b> means to <b>say:</b> Let <b>the owner of the ox come and stand by his ox</b> when the testimony about the ox is provided. Similarly, a document may be ratified only in the presence of the individual it implicates.
<b>Rava said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that the court <b>ratifies a document in the absence of a litigant, and</b> this is the case <b>even</b> if the other litigant <b>stands and screams</b> in protest that the document is a forgery. <b>And if he said: Give me time until I bring witnesses and disqualify the document, we give him</b> time before forcing him to pay. <b>If he has come</b> with witnesses within the time allotted to him, <b>he has come,</b> and the court reviews the case accordingly. <b>If he does not come</b> within the time allotted to him, <b>we give him</b> an additional three days on which to bring witnesses, when the court is in session: <b>Monday, Thursday, and Monday.</b>
<b>If he</b> still <b>has not come, we write a document of ostracism against him</b> for <b>ninety days.</b> During <b>the first thirty</b> days <b>we do not descend to his property</b> to collect his debt, <b>as</b> the court <b>says:</b> Perhaps <b>he is occupied</b> with <b>borrowing money</b> to pay his debt. During <b>the middle</b> period of thirty days <b>as well, we do not descend to his property, as</b> the court <b>says: Perhaps he did not find</b> someone <b>to borrow</b> from and <b>he is</b> now <b>occupied with selling</b> his property in order to pay his debt. During the <b>final</b> thirty days <b>as well, we do not descend to his property, as</b> the court <b>says:</b> Perhaps the debtor has found a purchaser and <b>the purchaser himself is occupied with</b> obtaining the <b>money</b> so that he can pay the debtor for the sale, and the debtor will then pay his debt.
If the debtor still <b>did not come</b> to pay his debt after ninety days, <b>we write</b> a document of <b>authorization [<i>adrakhta</i>]</b> allowing the creditor to collect his due from any <b>property</b> belonging to the debtor. <b>And this statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where</b> the debtor <b>said: I am coming</b> to pay and then he does not actually make an appearance. <b>But</b> if <b>he said: I am not coming, we immediately write</b> a document of authorization without waiting for ninety days to pass.
Furthermore, <b>this matter</b> of a ninety-day waiting period applies only <b>with regard to a loan,</b> as the debtor requires time in order to obtain the money to pay it back. <b>But with regard to a deposit</b> that the owner demands back from a bailee, <b>we write</b> a document of authorization <b>immediately.</b> Since a bailee should have immediate access to the deposit, there is no reason to grant him an extension.
The Gemara adds: <b>When we write</b> a document of authorization, the document applies only <b>to</b> the borrower’s <b>land, but</b> with regard <b>to movable property,</b> the court does <b>not</b> draft such a document. The reason for this is that <b>perhaps the creditor will seize and consume</b> the borrower’s <b>movable property, and when the borrower</b> later <b>comes and brings witnesses and</b> thereby <b>invalidates the</b> creditor’s <b>document, he will not find anything to collect</b> in order to retrieve his money.
<b>And if the creditor</b> owns <b>land, we write</b> a document authorizing the creditor to collect from any property that belongs to the borrower, including movable property. Since the creditor owns land, there is no concern that if the borrower manages to overturn the ruling he will have nothing from which to collect. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so.</b> The court <b>does not draft</b> a document of <b>authorization with regard to movable property even if</b> the creditor <b>has land.</b> This is because <b>we are concerned lest</b> the creditor’s land <b>depreciate</b> in value and the borrower will be unable to retrieve his money.
The Gemara teaches another <i>halakha</i> with regard to this matter: <b>When we write</b> the document of <b>authorization, we inform</b> the party that is liable to pay, as a final warning before authorizing a creditor to locate and take possession of his property in repayment of the debt. <b>And this matter</b> applies only <b>when he is nearby, but</b> if he is <b>distant,</b> the court does <b>not</b> notify him before authorizing the creditor.
<b>And if he is distant but there are relatives</b> of his nearby, <b>or</b> if <b>there are caravans that go</b> to the borrower’s current location <b>and return, we delay</b> issuing <b>his</b> document of authorization for the <b>twelve months</b> of <b>the year, until the caravan goes and returns,</b> so that if he wishes to make a claim, he can do so. This is <b>like that</b> incident <b>where Ravina delayed</b> for the <b>twelve months</b> of <b>the year</b> before issuing a document of authorization <b>for Mar Aḥa, until a caravan went</b> to <b>and returned from Bei Ḥozai.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so. There,</b> Ravina delayed issuing the document because the creditor <b>was a violent man,</b> and <b>if</b> a document of <b>authorization would come into his possession, it would not be possible to take it from him</b> if the borrower would prove that the original document was invalid. <b>But here,</b> i.e., in general, <b>we wait for</b> the defendant to be informed <b>only</b> if he is close enough to be informed within a day. Consequently, if the court decided the issue on Monday, <b>a messenger</b> would <b>go</b> inform the defendant <b>on Tuesday, and he</b> could <b>come</b> from his location to the court <b>on Wednesday and stand trial on Thursday.</b> If a debtor is more than a day’s travel away, however, the court does not trouble itself to notify him.
§ Apropos the Gemara’s discussion of summoning an individual to court by means of a messenger, the Gemara discusses this issue in a more general manner. <b>Ravina said: We deem the agent of the Rabbis,</b> who was sent to summon an individual to court, as <b>credible as two</b> witnesses if he says that the defendant refuses to come to court. <b>And this matter</b> applies only with regard <b>to excommunication, but</b> with regard <b>to</b> issuing <b>a document of ostracism, since it causes</b> the defendant <b>loss of money, as he must give money to the scribe</b> for drafting the document, <b>no,</b> the agent is not deemed credible.
Additionally, <b>Ravina said: We may give</b> a defendant a particular <b>time</b> to appear in court by informing him of the trial <b>by</b> word of <b>mouth from a woman or from his neighbors,</b> as these people are trusted to notify the defendant of the court’s summons. The Gemara comments: <b>And we said</b> this <b>only when</b> the defendant is <b>not in the city.</b>

Daf 113a

<b>But</b> if the defendant <b>is in the city,</b> the court does <b>not</b> ostracize him for failing to respond to a summons conveyed through a woman or a neighbor, <b>as we say:</b> Perhaps <b>they did not tell him</b> of the court’s summons, <b>as they said</b> to themselves: Since the defendant is in the city, <b>a court agent</b> has already <b>found him and told him.</b> As a result, these unofficial messengers will not deliver the court’s summons to the defendant at all.
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>we said</b> that the court will ostracize one who does not respond to a summons conveyed through a woman or a neighbor <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he does not pass by the court’s entrance</b> on his way home, <b>but</b> if he does <b>pass by the court’s entrance,</b> the court does <b>not</b> ostracize him. This is because it is possible that the unofficial messengers will <b>say</b> to themselves: Since he passes by the courthouse, <b>the court</b> has already <b>found him and told him.</b>
<b>And</b> furthermore, <b>we said</b> that the court will ostracize one who does not respond to a summons <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he comes</b> home <b>on the</b> same <b>day</b> that the woman or neighbor is sent to deliver the court summons. <b>But</b> if he does <b>not come</b> home <b>on the</b> same <b>day,</b> he is <b>not</b> ostracized, because it is possible to <b>say</b> that <b>they forgot</b> to notify him.
<b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>one</b> who had <b>a document of ostracism written about him due to</b> the fact that <b>he did not come to court, we do not tear up the document for him until he</b> actually <b>comes to court,</b> and it is not enough for him to simply commit to appearing. Similarly, if the document of ostracism was written <b>due to</b> the fact that <b>he did not obey</b> the ruling of <b>the court, we do not tear it up for him until he</b> actually <b>obeys</b> the ruling. The Gemara comments: This second statement <b>is not so.</b> Rather, <b>once he</b> has acquiesced and <b>said: I will obey, we</b> immediately <b>tear up the document for him.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The court <b>sets a date</b> for an individual to appear in court on the upcoming <b>Monday. And</b> if he does not appear, they set a date for that <b>Thursday, and</b> if he does not appear, they set a date for the following <b>Monday,</b> so that he has a second <b>date and</b> then a third <b>date after</b> the first <b>date. And</b> if he does not appear in court by the third date, then <b>on the next day we write</b> a document of ostracism.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Asi happened</b> to come to <b>the house of Rav Kahana. He saw</b> that there was <b>a certain woman whom</b> Rav Kahana had <b>summoned to</b> appear in <b>court in the evening,</b> but she did not appear, <b>and in the morning</b> Rav Kahana <b>wrote a document of ostracism concerning her.</b> Rav Asi said <b>to him:</b> Does <b>the Master not hold</b> in accordance with <b>that which Rav Ḥisda says,</b> that the court <b>sets a date</b> for the coming <b>Monday, and</b> then <b>Thursday, and</b> then the following <b>Monday</b> before it issues a document of ostracism?
Rav Kahana <b>said to him: That matter</b> applies only with regard to <b>a man, as he is a victim of circumstance and is not</b> always <b>in the city</b> due to his vocational activities. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a woman, since she is</b> always <b>in the city,</b> when <b>she does not come</b> to court the first time <b>she is</b> immediately considered <b>rebellious,</b> and the court may issue a document of ostracism right away.
Continuing the discussion of court dates, <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> The court <b>does not set a date for</b> legal proceedings <b>during the days of Nisan, nor during the days of Tishrei,</b> and also <b>not on the eve of a Festival nor the eve of Shabbat</b> because these are busy times. <b>But during Nisan we may set</b> a court date to take place <b>after Nisan, and</b> likewise, <b>during Tishrei</b> we may set a court date to take place <b>after Tishrei.</b> By contrast, <b>on the eve of Shabbat we do not</b> set a court date to take place <b>after the eve of Shabbat. What is the reason</b> for this? It is because <b>one is preoccupied with his work</b> in preparation <b>for Shabbat</b> and it is possible that he will forget about the court summons.
<b>Rav Naḥman says: We do not set</b> a court <b>date for participants in the <i>kalla</i>,</b> the gatherings for Torah study during Elul and Adar, <b>during</b> the months of the <b><i>kalla</i>, nor for participants in</b> the public discourses prior to <b>the Festival during the</b> period leading up to <b>the Festival.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>When</b> people <b>would come before Rav Naḥman</b> during the <i>kalla</i> period in order to make legal claims against others, <b>he would say to them: Did I gather you</b> here <b>for your</b> own needs? No, I gathered you to participate in Torah study. The Gemara adds: <b>But now that there are scoundrels,</b> who do not come to study Torah but rather to avoid trial, <b>we are concerned</b> that they will continue to evade prosecution, and therefore we summon them to court even during these time periods.
§ The mishna teaches, with regard to one who left a stolen item to his children, <b>if</b> the item <b>was something that may serve</b> as a legal <b>guarantee</b> of a loan, the heirs <b>are obligated to pay</b> the owner. The Gemara states that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi would <b>teach</b> this mishna to <b>Rabbi Shimon, his son,</b> and explain that it does <b>not</b> refer only to <b>something that can actually</b> serve as <b>a guarantee</b> for a loan, i.e., land. <b>Rather,</b> it refers <b>even</b> to <b>a cow</b> that <b>he plows with,</b> or <b>a donkey</b> that <b>he drives</b> by directing it from <b>behind,</b> which the heirs <b>are obligated to return because of the honor of their father,</b> so that people will not continually point out that the inheritance was stolen and thereby disgrace their deceased parent.
<b>Rav Kahana raises a dilemma before Rav:</b> If the robber left his heirs a stolen item that is used in relative privacy, such as <b>a bed that he lies on</b> or <b>a table upon which he eats,</b> rather than something as conspicuous as a large animal, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Are the heirs obligated to return it to its owner? Rav <b>said to him: “Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser”</b> (Proverbs 9:9), meaning that from the fact that the heirs must return a cow and a donkey, one can infer that they must also return a bed and a table.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not exchange</b> larger coins for smaller ones <b>from the trunk of customs collectors nor from the purse of tax collectors, and one may not take charity from them,</b> as they are assumed to have obtained their funds illegally. <b>But one may take</b> money <b>from</b> the collector’s <b>house or from</b> money he has with him in <b>the market</b> that he did not take from his collection trunk or purse.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the prohibition against exchanging money from the trunk of a customs collector: <b>But one may give</b> the customs collector <b>a dinar</b> as payment for a debt that amounts to less than a dinar, <b>and</b> when the collector <b>gives him change,</b> he may accept it.
It was taught in the mishna that one may not exchange money from the trunks of <b>customs collectors,</b> which are assumed to include stolen funds. The Gemara questions this ruling: <b>But doesn’t Shmuel say</b> that <b>the law of the kingdom is the law,</b> i.e., <i>halakha</i> requires Jews to obey the laws of the state in which they live. Accordingly, the customs are collected legally and it should be permitted to make use of the funds.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana said</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The mishna is discussing <b>a customs collector who does not have a limitation</b> placed by the governor on the amount he may collect, and he collects as he pleases. Alternatively, the Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai said:</b> The mishna is discussing <b>a customs collector who stands on his own,</b> i.e., he was not appointed by the government but, on his own, he forces people to give him money.
The Gemara notes: <b>There are</b> those <b>who teach</b> the statements of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana and the Sages of the school of Rabbi Yannai <b>with regard to this</b> following mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 9:2) and its attendant discussion. The customs collectors would not levy a duty for the garments one was wearing. In light of this, the mishna teaches: <b>A person may not wear</b> a garment made of <b>diverse kinds,</b> i.e., a combination of wool and linen, <b>even</b> if he wears it <b>on top of ten garments,</b> in order <b>to avoid</b> paying <b>customs.</b> It was noted that this <b>mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is prohibited to avoid</b> paying <b>customs</b> by wearing a garment of diverse kinds. <b>Rabbi Shimon says in the name of Rabbi Akiva: It is permitted to avoid</b> paying <b>customs</b> in this manner.
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds, they disagree about this:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> i.e., Rabbi Akiva, <b>holds</b> that <b>an unintentional act is permitted.</b> In this case, the prohibition is to benefit from wearing the garment, and that is not his intent, as his intention is merely to avoid paying the customs duties. Therefore, it is permitted. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>holds</b> that <b>an unintentional act is prohibited. But is</b> it ever <b>permitted to avoid customs? Doesn’t Shmuel say: The law of the kingdom is the law?</b>
In answer to this question, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana said</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The dispute in the <i>baraita</i> is <b>with regard to a customs collector who does not have a limitation</b> placed on the amount he may collect. Alternatively, Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai said:</b> The dispute is <b>with regard to a customs collector who stands on his own,</b> i.e., who is self-appointed.
The Gemara notes: <b>And there are</b> those <b>who teach</b> the statements of Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana and the Sages of the school of Rabbi Yannai <b>with regard to this</b> mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 27b): One <b>may vow before murderers, plunderers, and customs collectors</b> in order to reinforce the claim <b>that</b> a certain item that is being commandeered <b>is <i>teruma</i>,</b> or that <b>it belongs to the king’s house,</b> and thereby avoid its seizure, <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that it is not <i>teruma</i></b> or <b>that it does not belong to the king’s house.</b> It was asked: Can it be that it is permitted to pronounce such a vow <b>before customs collectors? But doesn’t Shmuel say: The law of the kingdom is the law?</b> It should therefore be prohibited to state such a vow before the customs collectors.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Kahana said</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The mishna in <i>Nedarim</i> issues its ruling <b>with regard to a customs collector who does not have a limitation</b> placed on the amount he may collect. Alternatively, the Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yannai say:</b> The mishna issues its ruling <b>with regard to a customs collector who stands on his own.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The mishna issues its ruling <b>with regard to a gentile customs collector,</b> whom one may deceive, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a Jew and a gentile who approach</b> the court <b>for judgment</b> in a legal dispute, <b>if you can vindicate</b> the Jew <b>under Jewish law, vindicate him, and say to</b> the gentile: <b>This is our law.</b> If he can be vindicated <b>under gentile law, vindicate him, and say to</b> the gentile: <b>This is your law. And if</b> it is <b>not</b> possible to vindicate him under either system of law, <b>one approaches</b> the case <b>circuitously,</b> seeking a justification to vindicate the Jew. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva</b> disagrees and <b>says: One does not approach</b> the case <b>circuitously</b> in order to vindicate the Jew <b>due to the sanctification of God’s name,</b> as God’s name will be desecrated if the Jewish judge employs dishonest means.
The Gemara infers from this <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> even according to <b>Rabbi Akiva, the reason</b> that the court does not employ trickery in order to vindicate the Jew is only <b>because there is</b> the consideration of <b>the sanctification of God’s name. Consequently,</b> if there <b>is no</b> consideration of <b>the sanctification of God’s name,</b> the court does <b>approach</b> the case circuitously. Apparently, it is permitted to deceive a gentile.
The Gemara challenges this assertion: <b>But is robbery</b> from <b>a gentile permitted? Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon said</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva taught this matter when he came from Zephirin: From where</b> is it derived that it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>rob a gentile?</b> It is from the fact that <b>the verse states</b> with regard to a Jew who has been sold as a slave to a gentile: <b>“After he is sold he may be redeemed”</b> (Leviticus 25:48),

Daf 113b

indicating <b>that</b> one should <b>not take</b> a Hebrew slave by force <b>and</b> thereby allow him to <b>leave</b> the gentile’s jurisdiction. Rather, the Jew must be freed by legal means. <b>One might have thought</b> that it is permitted to <b>deceive him</b> in order to free the Jew. <b>Therefore, the verse states: “And he shall reckon with him that bought him”</b> (Leviticus 25:50), in order to teach that one must <b>be precise</b> in the financial dealings <b>with</b> the <b>purchaser</b> of a Hebrew slave, and one must pay him the appropriate sum without employing any form of deception. This indicates that it is prohibited to steal from a gentile.
The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> It is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> ruling that permits the court to deceive a gentile is issued <b>with regard to</b> a regular <b>gentile,</b> whereas <b>that</b> verse, which teaches that it is prohibited to deceive a gentile, is stated <b>with regard to a gentile who resides in Eretz Yisrael and observes the seven Noahide mitzvot [<i>ger toshav</i>].</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: How is it possible to differentiate between a gentile and a <i>ger toshav</i>? <b>Aren’t both of them written next to each other,</b> indicating that the same <i>halakha</i> pertains to both? As it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: One who violates the prohibitions of the Sabbatical Year will be punished by having to resort to selling himself as a slave. And he will sell himself <b>not to you, but to a stranger, as it is stated:</b> “And sell himself unto <b>the stranger”</b> (Leviticus 25:47), <b>and not to a stranger</b> who is a convert, <b>but to a <i>ger toshav</i>, as it is stated:</b> “And sell himself unto <b>the stranger who is a settler [<i>ger toshav</i>]</b> with you” (Leviticus 25:47).
The verse continues and states: “Or to the offshoot of a stranger’s family.” When it says <b>“a stranger’s family,” this</b> is referring to <b>the gentile</b> family members of a <i>ger toshav</i>, who are idolaters. <b>When it says “or to the offshoot,” this</b> is referring to a Jew <b>who is sold to idol worship,</b> i.e., to work in a temple dedicated to idolatry. Since it is subsequently stated: “He shall reckon with him that bought him” (Leviticus 25:50), it is apparent that this reckoning applies equally to each of the above, including the gentile. This contradicts Rav Yosef’s answer.
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> It is <b>not difficult</b> because <b>here,</b> in the case of the slave, the <i>halakha</i> is stated <b>with regard to</b> an actual act of <b>robbery</b> committed against a gentile, <b>but there,</b> in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, where it would be permitted to employ deception if not for the desecration of God’s name, the <i>halakha</i> is stated <b>with regard to abrogating his loan.</b> Abrogating a loan owed to a gentile is permitted because it does not entail actually taking money.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: The release of <b>a Hebrew slave</b> from his gentile master <b>is</b> akin to the <b>abrogation of his loan.</b> The purchase price paid by the master is considered as a loan that the slave pays back over the years of his servitude until he goes free at the Jubilee. Consequently, deceptively bringing about his early release is akin to abrogating a loan, yet Rabbi Akiva derives from the verse that it is prohibited to do so. The Gemara answers that <b>Rava</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rava says: The body of a Hebrew slave is owned</b> by his master, and retaking him from the gentile by deceptive means would therefore constitute actual robbery.
The Gemara cites another statement related to stealing from a gentile. <b>Rav Beivai bar Giddel says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon Ḥasida says:</b> It is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>rob a gentile,</b> but it is <b>permitted</b> to retain <b>his lost item,</b> i.e., one is not required to return it to him. The Gemara examines the basis for each of these rulings: It is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>rob a gentile, as Rav Huna says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> it is <b>prohibited</b> to <b>rob a gentile?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated: “And you shall consume all the peoples that the Lord your God shall deliver unto you”</b> (Deuteronomy 7:16), indicating that it is permitted to consume the other nations’ property only <b>when they are delivered into your hand,</b> i.e., in times of war, <b>but not when they are not delivered into your hand.</b>
It is <b>permitted</b> to retain <b>his lost item, as Rav Ḥama bar Gurya says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived that it is <b>permitted</b> to retain <b>the lost item of a gentile?</b> It is derived from a verse, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to the mitzva of returning a lost item: <b>“With every lost thing of your brother’s”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3), indicating that it is only <b>to your brother</b> that <b>you return</b> a lost item, <b>but you do not return</b> a lost item <b>to a gentile.</b>
The Gemara questions this derivation: <b>But say</b> that <b>this applies</b> only <b>where</b> the item <b>has not yet come into</b> the Jew’s <b>hand, as he is not obligated to pursue it</b> in an effort to find the lost item and return it. <b>But</b> in a case <b>where the item had</b> already <b>come into his hand, say</b> that he must <b>return it</b> to the gentile. The Gemara answers that <b>Ravina said:</b> It is understood from the verse itself, as it states: “And so shall you do with every lost thing of your brother’s, which he has lost, <b>and you have found”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:3), which <b>indicates</b> that the verse refers even to an item <b>that</b> has already <b>come into one’s hand.</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir says: In a case where there is</b> a concern that retention of an article lost by a gentile will result in the <b>desecration of</b> God’s <b>name,</b> it is <b>prohibited even</b> to retain a gentile’s <b>lost item.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>Shmuel says</b> that it is <b>permitted</b> to financially benefit from a business <b>error</b> of a gentile, i.e., it need not be returned. The Gemara notes that this is <b>like that</b> incident <b>where Shmuel purchased a golden bowl [<i>lakna</i>] from a gentile in exchange [<i>bemar</i>] for</b> the price <b>of an iron</b> bowl, which was <b>four dinars, and</b> Shmuel <b>included one</b> additional <b>dinar</b> in the payment so that the gentile would not realize his mistake.
The Gemara relates another incident: <b>Rav Kahana purchased one hundred and twenty barrels from a gentile for</b> the price of <b>one hundred</b> barrels, <b>and he included one</b> additional <b>dinar</b> in the payment. Rav Kahana <b>said to him: Take note that I am relying upon you</b> to check that the transaction has been carried out properly. The Gemara records a third episode: <b>Ravina and a gentile purchased a palm tree</b> together in order <b>to chop it up</b> and split the wood between them. Ravina <b>said to his attendant: Hurry and precede</b> the gentile so that you can bring my share of the wood <b>from the trunk</b> of the tree, which is thicker than the upper part of the tree, <b>as the gentile knows</b> only the <b>number</b> of logs that he is due to receive and will not realize that you are taking thicker pieces.
The Gemara relates a final anecdote: <b>Rav Ashi was traveling on the road</b> and <b>he saw a branch of a grapevine in an orchard, and</b> there were <b>clusters of grapes hanging on it. He said to his attendant: Go see</b> to whom these clusters belong. <b>If they are</b> owned by <b>a gentile, bring</b> some to me, but <b>if they are</b> owned by <b>a Jew, do not bring me</b> any. <b>A certain gentile who was sitting in the orchard overheard</b> Rav Ashi’s instructions. The gentile <b>said to him:</b> Is it <b>permitted</b> to steal the property <b>of a gentile?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: A gentile takes money</b> for his grapes, and I intended to pay for them, but <b>a Jew does not take money</b> for his grapes and I did not want to take them without paying for them.
§ The Gemara relates to <b>the</b> matter of civil law <b>itself. Shmuel says: The law of the kingdom is the law,</b> and the halakhic principle is that Jews must obey the laws of the state in which they reside. <b>Rava said: Know</b> that this principle is true from the fact <b>that</b> the municipal authorities <b>cut down palm trees</b> without the consent of their owners <b>and construct bridges</b> from them, <b>and</b> yet <b>we cross over them.</b> Evidently, the wood is not considered stolen property, which one is prohibited from using, because the law of the kingdom is the law.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rava: <b>Perhaps</b> the reason the bridges may be used is <b>because their owners despaired of retrieving them</b> and not because the law of the kingdom is the law. Rava <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>If not</b> for the fact that <b>the law of the kingdom is the law, how</b> would the <b>despair</b> of the owners of the trees allow us to use the bridges? The fact that the owners have despaired of retrieving their wood does not effect a transfer of property, and it therefore still belongs to them.
The Gemara questions Rava’s understanding: <b>But</b> the municipal authorities <b>do not act as the king said. The king said: Go and cut</b> down a bit of wood <b>from all the valleys</b> in the area so that each individual loses only a small amount of wood. <b>They,</b> however, disobey the king and <b>go and cut</b> down all the wood needed for the bridge <b>from one valley.</b> Therefore, even if the law of the kingdom is the law, this cannot be the reason that the <i>halakha</i> permits Jews to cross over such bridges, as the authorities are not enforcing the law of the kingdom, but rather their own unlawful inclinations.
The Gemara answers: <b>An agent of a king</b> is <b>like the king</b> himself, and he is <b>not</b> expected to <b>trouble</b> himself to collect wood proportionally from each valley. <b>They,</b> the owners of the land where the wood is cut, <b>cause themselves a loss, as they should collect</b> compensation <b>from all</b> the other residents <b>of the valleys and take money</b> from them for this purpose. Since the land owners whose wood was used have permission to collect compensation from all the residents in the area, the authorities are acting within their rights by confiscating wood from a single location.
Similarly, <b>Rava says:</b> When the king’s agents come to collect the king’s share of the grain from a field owned by several partners, the <b>one who is found in the granary</b> must <b>pay the king’s share</b> for the entire property, as the agents are not expected to locate and exact payment from each individual proprietor separately. The partner who paid may later claim reimbursement from the other owners for covering their share of the tax. <b>And this statement</b> applies only to <b>partners</b> who share ownership of the field. <b>But a sharecropper collects his portion</b> from the crop but does not own a share of the land. Consequently, the tax may not be collected from his produce, and doing so would constitute robbery.
<b>And Rava</b> also <b>says:</b> Property that belongs to <b>a town dweller may be taken as security for</b> the tax owed by another <b>town dweller. And this statement applies</b> only <b>to the property tax and head tax of that year, but</b> with regard to taxes from <b>the previous year, since the king has</b> already <b>been appeased,</b> the ability to take property belonging to someone else has <b>passed.</b> The tax collector has already paid the entire amount he must pay the king for the previous year, and everything else he collects is his own profit. Although he has the right to collect this extra amount, he may not take property for one person as security for the taxes of someone else.
<b>And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>those</b> gentiles <b>who construct pens</b> for their animals <b>inside the</b> city <b>limits</b> and charge a fee to bring their animals through the fields around the city to fertilize the fields, it is <b>prohibited to purchase</b> animals <b>from them. What is the reason?</b> It is <b>because the livestock of the</b> Jewish residents of the <b>town become intermingled with their</b> livestock, and it is possible that the animal one would buy is actually stolen property.
Rava adds: If the pens were <b>outside the</b> city <b>limits,</b> it is <b>permitted to purchase</b> livestock <b>from them,</b> as it is unlikely that a Jew’s livestock became intermingled with the seller’s livestock. <b>Ravina said: If the owners</b> of the livestock <b>were pursuing</b> the animals, then <b>even</b> if the pens were <b>outside the</b> city <b>limits, it is prohibited</b> to purchase livestock from the owners of the pens.
§ Apropos the discussion of legal dealings between Jews and gentiles, the Gemara relates: <b>Rava declared, and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Huna</b> who declared: All <b>who ascend upward</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>and</b> all who <b>descend downward</b> to Babylonia agree that in the case of <b>a Jew who knows</b> of <b>evidence concerning</b> the legal claim of <b>a gentile, and</b> the gentile <b>did not demand from him</b> that he testify, <b>and</b> the Jew nevertheless <b>went and testified for him in a gentile court, against his fellow Jew, we excommunicate him. What is the reason</b> that we excommunicate him? It is <b>because they,</b> the gentile courts, <b>expropriate money</b>

Daf 114a

based <b>on the word of one</b> witness, which is insufficient evidence according to Jewish law. <b>And we said</b> that this is so <b>only</b> when <b>one</b> individual testifies alone against his fellow Jew, <b>but when two</b> witnesses testify against a Jew, we do <b>not</b> excommunicate them, as their testimony is sufficient evidence according to Jewish law as well, and they have not caused the defendant any unjustified financial loss even according to <i>halakha</i>. <b>And</b> in a case of <b>a single</b> witness <b>also, we said</b> that we excommunicate him <b>only</b> if he testified <b>in a court of villagers [<i>demagista</i>], but</b> if he testified in <b>the</b> official government <b>courthouse [<i>bei davar</i>],</b> he is not excommunicated. This is because <b>they also prescribe an oath to</b> the defendant based on the testimony of <b>a single</b> witness, but they do not expropriate money, in accordance with Jewish law.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ashi said: When I was in the academy of Rav Huna,</b> the following <b>dilemma was raised before us:</b> What is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to an <b>important person,</b> whose testimony <b>is relied upon</b> by the gentile courts <b>as</b> if it were the testimony of <b>two</b> witnesses? Since the gentile court will <b>expropriate money</b> based <b>on his word,</b> should the <i>halakha</i> be that <b>he should not testify? Or perhaps, since he is an important person, he cannot escape</b> the authorities who demand his testimony, <b>and he may</b> therefore <b>testify.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The Gemara cites another situation where a Jew is excommunicated for causing harm to another Jew. <b>Rav Ashi said:</b> In the case of <b>a Jewish man who sells a gentile</b> a plot of <b>land</b> that is <b>on the border of</b> the property of <b>his fellow Jew, we excommunicate him. What is the reason? If we say</b> it is <b>because</b> he has ignored <b>the right of one</b> whose field <b>borders</b> the field of his neighbor to be the first one offered the purchase of the field, <b>but doesn’t the Master say:</b> With regard to <b>one who purchases</b> land <b>from a gentile, and one who sells</b> land <b>to a gentile, there is no right of one</b> whose field <b>borders</b> the field of his neighbor to be the first one offered the purchase of the field?
<b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because we say to him</b> on behalf of the owner of the adjacent field: <b>You have placed a lion,</b> i.e., a dangerous individual, <b>on my border,</b> as the gentile might now cause me harm. Consequently, <b>we excommunicate him until he accepts upon himself</b> responsibility for <b>all harm that comes</b> upon the neighbor <b>due to</b> the gentile’s activities.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>customs collectors took one’s donkey and gave him a different donkey</b> that was taken from another Jew in its stead, or if <b>bandits took his garment and gave him a different garment</b> that was taken from a Jew in its stead, <b>these</b> items <b>are</b> now <b>his because the owners despaired of</b> retrieving <b>them</b> when they were stolen, and they may therefore be acquired by another. In a case of <b>one who salvages</b> items <b>from a river, or from a troop [<i>hagayis</i>]</b> of soldiers, <b>or from bandits, if the owners</b> of the items <b>despaired</b> of retrieving them, <b>they are his,</b> i.e., they belong to the one who salvaged them. <b>And so too,</b> with regard to <b>a swarm of bees, if</b> the owners <b>despaired</b> of retrieving the bees, <b>they are his,</b> i.e., they belong to the one who found them.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka said: A woman or a minor,</b> whose testimony is not generally accepted by the court, <b>is deemed credible to say:</b> It was <b>from here that this swarm emerged,</b> and it therefore belongs to a certain individual. <b>And</b> one <b>may walk into another’s field</b> in order <b>to salvage his</b> own <b>swarm</b> of bees that has relocated there, <b>and if he damaged</b> some property in the process, <b>he must pay</b> for <b>what he has damaged. But</b> if the bees settled on a branch of a tree, <b>he may not cut</b> off the other’s <b>branch</b> in order to take the bees, even <b>on the condition</b> that he will later <b>give him the money</b> for it. <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: He may even cut</b> off the branch <b>and</b> later <b>give</b> him <b>the money</b> for it as compensation.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who is given an item by a customs collector or a bandit may keep the item. It was <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If he took</b> a donkey from the customs collector, <b>he</b> must <b>return</b> it <b>to the original owners.</b> The Gemara explains: The <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>despair alone does not effect</b> legal <b>acquisition.</b> Consequently, the customs collector did not acquire the donkey, <b>and it initially came into the possession</b> of the individual to whom the customs collector gave it <b>illegally,</b> and he is therefore required to return it to the original owner.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means that <b>if he</b> wants to act beyond the letter of the law and <b>comes to return it</b> voluntarily, he should <b>return it to the original owners,</b> but he is not required to return it. <b>What is the reason</b> that he is not required to return it? It is because <b>despair alone effects</b> legal <b>acquisition</b> and the donkey was, therefore, acquired by the Jew when the customs collector gave it to him. <b>Nevertheless, if he said: I do not want</b> to accept <b>money that is not mine, he returns</b> it <b>to the original owners.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that if customs collectors or bandits replaced one’s item with one taken from another Jew, <b>these</b> items <b>are</b> now <b>his because the owners</b> despaired of retrieving them when they were stolen. In this regard, <b>Rav Ashi says: They taught</b> that the owners certainly despaired of recovering their property <b>only</b> when it was stolen by <b>a gentile bandit, but</b> if it was taken by <b>a Jewish bandit, no,</b> the owner did not necessarily despair of recovering it. This is because the victim of the theft might <b>reason: Tomorrow, I will take him to court</b> and force him to return what he stole.
<b>Rav Yosef objects to this: On the contrary, the opposite is</b> more <b>reasonable:</b> When dealing with <b>gentiles, who judge</b> a case and impose their verdicts <b>with force, he does not despair</b> because he realizes that the gentile court will enforce the law. By contrast, when dealing with <b>a Jew, since</b> Jewish courts merely <b>pronounce a verbal</b> decision but do not have the authority to enforce it, the victim <b>despairs</b> of recovering his property.
<b>Rather, if</b> Rav Ashi’s distinction <b>was stated, it was stated with regard to the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which states: In the case of <b>one who salvages</b> an item <b>from gentiles or from bandits,</b> if the owners despaired of retrieving it, the one who finds it may keep it. The Gemara infers: <b>If</b> it is known that <b>the owners despaired</b> of retreating it, <b>yes,</b> the finder may keep the item; but in <b>an unspecified</b> situation, where it is not known whether the owners despaired, the finder may <b>not</b> keep the item.
Concerning this, Rav Ashi said: <b>They taught</b> this <b>only</b> when the item was stolen by <b>a gentile</b> bandit, <b>because</b> the gentile court <b>judges</b> a case and imposes its verdict <b>with force,</b> and therefore it cannot be assumed that the owners despair. <b>But</b> if the robbery was committed by <b>a Jewish bandit, since</b> Jewish courts merely <b>pronounce a verbal</b> decision but do not have the authority to enforce it, the victim <b>despairs</b> of recovering his property.
§ Apropos the discussion with regard to an owner’s despair of retrieving a lost or stolen item, the Gemara notes that <b>we learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Kelim</i> 26:8): With regard to <b>hides</b> that are tanned by the <b>owner</b> himself, <b>thought renders them susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> Hides and leather are susceptible to contracting impurity only if they are in a finished state. If a private individual uses a piece of hide or leather for a certain purpose, e.g., as a cot or a table top, and decides that this will be its fixed purpose, it is considered a finished product and is susceptible to contracting impurity.
<b>But</b> with regard to hides <b>belonging to a leatherworker, thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> Since this individual sells leather to others, when he uses a piece of leather for a household purpose and decides that this will be its fixed purpose, it is not considered a finished state, as he is likely to change his mind and sell the leather to one who will process it further and put it to a different use.
The mishna continues: If the hides are those <b>of a thief,</b> who has stolen them from another, the thief’s <b>thought renders them susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> If they are those <b>of a robber,</b> his <b>thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity,</b> because he is not considered the owner of the hide. The difference is that unlike the case of a thief, who steals items stealthily, the identity of a robber, who takes the item openly, is known to the owner, and he harbors hope of finding him and getting the item back. Consequently, he does not despair of recovering his property.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says</b> that <b>the matters are reversed:</b> In the case <b>of a robber,</b> the robber’s <b>thought renders them susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> If the hides are those <b>of a thief, thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity, because the owners have not despaired</b> of recovering them and the thief has not acquired the hide. Rabbi Shimon’s reasoning is that a robber, who seizes items brazenly, is a more difficult criminal to apprehend and bring to justice than a thief.
The Gemara analyzes the scope of the dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the first <i>tanna</i>. <b>Ulla says: The dispute</b> is only with regard <b>to an unspecified</b> case, where it is unknown whether or not the owners despaired, <b>but where it is known</b> that the owners despaired, <b>all agree</b> that their <b>despair</b> effects legal <b>acquisition.</b> By contrast, <b>Rabba says:</b> Even in cases <b>where it is known</b> that the owners despaired, there is <b>also a dispute,</b> because although the owner may have expressed despair verbally, he may still hope to retrieve the item.
<b>Abaye said to Rabba: Do not disagree with Ulla, as</b> the formulation of the <i>halakha</i> that <b>we learned in the mishna</b> is <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion. The mishna states that according to Rabbi Shimon, thought does not render the hides of a thief susceptible to ritual impurity <b>because the owners did not despair</b> of retrieving them, and therefore the hides do not belong to the thief. This indicates that <b>the reason</b> the thought of the thief does not render the hides susceptible to ritual impurity <b>is that the owners did not despair</b> of retrieving them. <b>But</b> if <b>the owners</b> had <b>despaired</b> of retrieving them, then <b>these</b> items would be <b>his,</b> and his thoughts would render the hides susceptible to ritual impurity.
Rabba <b>said to him: We learned</b> the mishna as saying: A thief cannot render the hides susceptible to ritual impurity <b>because there is no</b> true <b>despair for owners</b> of stolen goods, even if they state they have despaired.
<b>We learned</b> in the mishna here that if <b>customs collectors took one’s donkey</b> and replaced it with a donkey taken from another Jew, or if bandits took his garment and replaced it with a garment taken from another Jew, he may keep these items because the owners despaired of retrieving them when they were stolen. The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in this mishna?
<b>If</b> it is in accordance with <b>the Rabbis,</b> who hold that the owner despairs only in the case of a thief who steals secretly, it <b>is difficult,</b> because the mishna indicates that the victim of <b>a robber</b> also despairs of retrieving his property, as in the case of a customs collector. And <b>if</b> it is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that the owner despairs only in the case of a robber, it <b>is difficult,</b> because the mishna indicates that the victim of <b>a thief</b> also despairs of retrieving his property, as in the case of bandits.
<b>Granted, according to Ulla, who says</b> that all agree that if <b>it is known</b> that the owners despaired, the individual in possession of the items <b>acquires</b> them, <b>here too</b> it is possible to explain that the mishna is discussing a case <b>where it is known</b> that the owners despaired, <b>and all agree</b> that the recipient of the stolen property may keep it.
<b>But according to Rabba, who says</b> that even in cases <b>where it is known</b> that the owners despaired, there is <b>also a dispute,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna written? <b>It is not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and it is not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> The Gemara answers that the mishna is discussing a case of <b>an armed bandit,</b> who is similar to a robber in that he steals using force and aggression. <b>And it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that the victim of a robber despairs of recovering his property.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, this is</b> identical to the case of <b>a robber,</b> i.e., the customs collector, and there is no reason for the mishna to teach the same <i>halakha</i> twice. The Gemara answers that the mishna in fact teaches the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>two</b> different <b>types</b> of <b>robbers,</b> the customs collector and the armed bandit.
The Gemara suggests another proof with regard to the dispute between Ulla and Rabba. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a thief, a robber, and one who forces</b> another to sell him some-thing, <b>their consecrated items are</b> considered <b>consecrated, and their <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, <b>is</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>, and their tithes are</b> considered <b>tithes.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in this <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> it is in accordance with <b>the Rabbis,</b> it <b>is difficult</b> because the <i>baraita</i> assumes that even the victim of <b>a robber</b> despairs of retrieving his property, as seen from the <i>halakha</i> that the robber’s act of consecration or separation of <i>teruma</i> or tithes is valid. This contradicts the opinion of the Rabbis, who hold that the thoughts of a robber do not render the hides susceptible to ritual impurity, because he is not considered the owner of the hides. Conversely, <b>if</b> it is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> it <b>is difficult</b> because the <i>baraita</i> assumes that the victim of <b>a thief</b> despairs of retrieving his property, as seen from the <i>halakha</i> that the thief's act of consecration or separation of <i>teruma</i> or tithes is valid. This contradicts the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, as he holds that the thoughts of a thief do not render the hides susceptible to ritual impurity, because he is not considered the owner of the hides.
<b>Granted, according to Ulla, who says</b> that <b>all agree</b> that if <b>it is known</b> that the owners despaired of recovering their property, the individual in possession of the items <b>acquires</b> them, <b>here too,</b> it is possible to explain that the mishna is discussing a case <b>where it is known</b> that the owners despaired. <b>But according to Rabba, who says</b> that even in cases <b>where it is known</b> that the owners despaired, there is <b>also a dispute,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i> written? It is <b>not</b> written in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and</b> it is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> when the <i>baraita</i> mentions a thief it is actually referring to <b>an armed bandit,</b> who is considered a robber because he steals using force and aggression. <b>And it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that the victim of a robber despairs of recovering his property. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, this</b> case of a thief <b>is</b> identical to the case of <b>a robber,</b> and there is no reason for the <i>baraita</i> to teach the same <i>halakha</i> twice. The Gemara answers that the <i>baraita</i> wishes to teach the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>two</b> different <b>types</b> of <b>robbers.</b>
The Gemara offers an alternative explanation: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>this <i>baraita</i></b> is referring to an actual thief, and <b>it is</b> written in accordance the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: A thief</b> is <b>like a robber.</b>

Daf 114b

<b>And we maintain,</b> as the Gemara concludes below, that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi means that the <i>halakha</i> that applies to a thief is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> that applies to <b>a robber according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that the owner despairs of recovering his item once it is stolen by a robber.
§ The Gemara examines <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that applies to a thief is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> that applies to <b>a robber. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Was Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>saying</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that applies to a thief is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> that applies to <b>a robber</b> according to the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who hold that the owners do not despair of recovering their item, <b>and</b> a thief therefore does <b>not acquire</b> the items he steals? <b>Or perhaps he was saying</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that applies to a thief is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> that applies to <b>a robber</b> according to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that the owners despair of recovering their property, <b>and</b> a thief therefore <b>acquires</b> the stolen items.
The Gemara attempts to resolve the dilemma. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: If <b>customs collectors took</b> one’s <b>donkey</b> and gave him a different donkey that was taken from another Jew in its stead, or if bandits took his garment and gave him a different garment that was taken from a Jew in its stead, these items are now his because the owners despaired of retrieving them when they were stolen. It is therefore apparent that despair is assumed both in the case of a robber, i.e., the customs collector, and in the case of a thief, i.e., the bandits.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in this mishna? <b>If</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who assume that the owners despair only in the case of a thief, it <b>is difficult</b> because the mishna assumes that the victim of <b>a robber</b> also despairs of retrieving his property. And <b>if</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who assumes that the owners despair only in the case of a robber, it <b>is difficult</b> because the mishna assumes that the victim of <b>a thief</b> also despairs of retrieving his property.
The Gemara presents the proof: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was saying</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that applies to a thief is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> that applies to <b>a robber</b> according to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that the owners despair of recovering their property, <b>and</b> a thief therefore <b>acquires</b> the stolen items, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, and it is <b>due to that</b> reason that a thief <b>acquires</b> the stolen goods.
<b>But if you say</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was saying</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that applies to a thief is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> that applies to <b>a robber</b> according to the opinion <b>of the Rabbis, and</b> a thief therefore does <b>not acquire</b> the stolen goods, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? Since the mishna rules that the owners have presumably despaired with regard to both a thief and a robber, it is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and it is not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, and it is not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with an armed bandit,</b> who is considered a robber because he steals using force and aggression, <b>and</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that despair is assumed in the case of a robber. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, this is</b> identical to the case of <b>a robber,</b> i.e., the mishna’s first case of the customs collector, and there is no reason for the mishna to teach the same <i>halakha</i> twice. The Gemara answers: The mishna wishes to teach the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>two</b> different <b>types</b> of <b>robbers.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a different proof based upon the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a thief, a robber, and one who forces</b> another to sell him something, <b>their consecrated items are</b> considered <b>consecrated, and their <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, <b>is</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>, and their tithes are</b> considered <b>tithes.</b>
<b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in this <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> it is in accordance with <b>the Rabbis,</b> it <b>is difficult</b> because the <i>baraita</i> assumes that the victim of <b>a robber</b> also despairs of retrieving his property, and therefore the robber’s act of consecration or separation of <i>teruma</i> or tithes is valid. Conversely, <b>if</b> it is in accordance with <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> it <b>is difficult</b> because the <i>baraita</i> assumes that the victim of <b>a thief</b> despairs of retrieving his property.
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>was saying</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that applies to a thief is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> that applies to <b>a robber</b> according to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that the owner despairs of recovering his property, it is <b>due to that</b> reason that a thief therefore <b>acquires</b> the stolen items. <b>But if you say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that applies to a thief is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> that applies to <b>a robber</b> according to the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> <i>baraita</i> written?
The Gemara responds: When the <i>baraita</i> refers to a thief, it is actually referring <b>to an armed bandit,</b> who is legally considered a robber, <b>and it is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> who holds that victims of a robber despair of recovering their property. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, this is</b> identical to the case of <b>a robber</b> that is mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> wishes to teach the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>two</b> different <b>types</b> of <b>robbers.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said to Rabba: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s own interpretation of the mishna (111b) that states that children who inherit an item that was stolen by their father are obligated to return it to the owner if it is something that serves as a legal guarantee of a loan, e.g., land. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>would teach Rabbi Shimon, his son,</b> that the mishna is <b>not</b> referring only to <b>something that may actually serve</b> as a legal <b>guarantee,</b> i.e., land. <b>Rather,</b> it is referring <b>even</b> to <b>a cow</b> that <b>he plows with,</b> or <b>a donkey</b> that <b>he drives</b> by directing it from <b>behind,</b> which the heirs <b>are obligated to return because of the honor of their father.</b>
The Gemara infers: The <b>reason</b> that the heirs must return the stolen item is <b>due to the honor of their father. But</b> if it were <b>not</b> for <b>the honor of their father,</b> they would <b>not</b> be required to return it. <b>Conclude from it</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>was saying</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that applies to a thief is <b>like</b> the <i>halakha</i> that applies to <b>a robber</b> according to the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that this is so.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And so too,</b> with regard to <b>a swarm of bees,</b> if the owners despaired of retrieving the bees, they belong to the one who found them. The Gemara inquires: <b>What</b> is the reason that the mishna includes the case of the bees, which begins with the term: <b>And so too?</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>This is</b> what <b>it is saying:</b> The <i>halakha</i> stated by the mishna applies <b>even</b> to <b>a swarm of bees, which is</b> the property of the owners via <b>a rabbinic</b> form of <b>acquisition</b> due to the fact that one cannot effect a legal acquisition of bees by Torah law. It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that in <b>this</b> case, <b>since one acquires</b> the swarm of bees <b>only by rabbinic law, even</b> where the owners’ response is <b>unspecified</b> it can be assumed that they <b>despair</b> of recovering the bees, and the finder may keep them. To counter this, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that <b>if</b> it is known that <b>the owners</b> of the bees <b>despaired</b> of recovering them, <b>yes,</b> the finder may keep the bees; <b>if</b> they did <b>not</b> despair, <b>no,</b> he may not keep them.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka said: A woman or a minor is deemed credible</b> to say: It was from here that this swarm emerged, and it therefore belongs to a certain individual.
The Gemara asks: <b>Are a woman and a minor eligible for testimony?</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that women and minors cannot present testimony in court, so how can Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka rule that they are deemed credible? The Gemara explains that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: Here, we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where the owners were pursuing</b> the bees, <b>and the woman and the minor were speaking offhandedly and saying:</b> It was <b>from here that this swarm emerged.</b> In this context, it can be assumed that the individual identified as the owner is the real owner of the bees, even in the absence of formal testimony in court.
Having mentioned a case of offhand remarks, the Gemara states that <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> Information gleaned from <b>one who speaks offhandedly is valid only with regard to testimony</b> enabling <b>a woman</b> to remarry, as the Sages were lenient and decreed that the incidental remarks of certain individuals who are not eligible to serve as witnesses may be relied upon in such a case.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: And</b> is it so that one does <b>not</b> rely upon offhand remarks in other situations? <b>But</b> the case in the mishna of <b>a swarm of bees is</b> a case of <b>one</b> who <b>speaks offhandedly,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is that he is deemed credible. Rav Ashi answered: <b>A swarm of bees is different, as it is</b> the property of its owners via <b>a rabbinic</b> form of <b>acquisition.</b> Consequently, the Sages relied on offhand remarks.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is there <b>no</b> case where offhand remarks expressed by those who are ineligible to testify in court would be accepted <b>by Torah law? But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a certain person who was speaking offhandedly and saying: I remember when I was a child and I</b> would still <b>ride on father’s shoulder. And they took me from school, and removed my tunic, and immersed me</b> in a ritual bath so that I would be able <b>to partake of <i>teruma</i> that evening.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Ḥanina</b> would <b>conclude</b> his retelling of the incident <b>as follows:</b> That individual then went on to say: <b>And my friends</b> would <b>separate</b> themselves <b>from me, and they would call me: Yoḥanan, eater of <i>ḥallot</i>,</b> a reference to the portion of dough given to the priests, which has the same status as <i>teruma</i>. <b>And</b> after hearing this anecdote, <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>elevated him to the priesthood</b> and granted him the right to partake of <i>teruma</i> based <b>on his statement.</b> Since it is prohibited for non-priests to consume <i>teruma</i> by Torah law, it is apparent that offhand remarks may be relied upon even with regard to Torah law, even in cases unrelated to enabling a woman to remarry.
Rav Ashi answers: Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi granted him the right to partake of produce that is <b><i>teruma</i></b> only <b>by rabbinic law,</b> as he holds that the requirement to separate <i>teruma</i> after the destruction of the Temple is by rabbinic law. One can still posit that offhand remarks made by individuals who are ineligible to testify in court are not deemed credible with regard to Torah law.
The Gemara asks: <b>And still,</b> is there <b>no</b> other case where offhand remarks made by those who are ineligible to testify in court would be accepted <b>by Torah law? But when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, didn’t <b>he say</b> that <b>Rav Ḥana of Carthage [Kartigna], and some say</b> that it was <b>Rav Aḥa of Carthage, related: An incident came before Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, and some say</b> that this <b>incident came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>with regard to a certain child who was speaking offhandedly and said: My mother and I were captured</b> and held <b>among the gentiles.</b> When <b>I would go out to draw water, my mind</b> was <b>on my mother,</b> and when I would go out <b>to gather wood, my mind</b> was <b>on my mother.</b> Since the child was always conscious of his mother, he was aware that she was not violated by her captors.
The Gemara concludes the statement of Rav Dimi and explains the challenge: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>married her to a priest</b> based <b>on his statement.</b> Since it is prohibited by Torah law for a priest to marry a woman who has engaged in sexual intercourse with a man forbidden to her by Torah law and with whom she cannot establish a marital bond, e.g., a gentile, it is clear that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi relied on an offhand remark even with regard to a prohibition by Torah law.
The Gemara answers: The Sages <b>were lenient with regard to a captured woman.</b> By Torah law, a woman taken captive may be presumed to remain permitted to a priest, and it is the Sages who decreed that she is forbidden due to the concern that she was raped. It is this rabbinic decree that may be disregarded on the basis of offhand remarks.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But</b> if the bees settled on a branch of a tree, <b>he may not cut</b> off the other’s <b>branch</b> in order to take the bees, even on the condition that he will later give him the money for it. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: It is a stipulation of the court,</b> which takes effect even without being confirmed by individuals, <b>that one will</b> be permitted to <b>enter another’s field and cut off another’s branch</b> in order <b>to salvage his</b> own <b>swarm</b> of bees. <b>And</b> the owner of the field then <b>collects the value of his branch from his fellow’s swarm.</b>
<b>And it is</b> also <b>a stipulation of the court that</b> one who sees another’s honey barrel break <b>should pour out his</b> own <b>wine and</b> then use the empty wine barrel to <b>salvage the other’s honey,</b> which is more expensive than wine. <b>And</b> the owner of the wine then <b>collects the value of his wine from the other’s honey. And it is</b> also <b>a stipulation of the court that one</b> who sees that another’s donkey has fallen <b>should unload his</b> own <b>wood</b> from his own donkey <b>and load the other’s flax,</b> which is more expensive than wood, in its place. <b>And</b> the owner of the wood then <b>collects the value of his wood from the other’s flax.</b> These stipulations take effect <b>as</b> it was <b>on this condition</b> that <b>Joshua apportioned Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to the Jewish people.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>one who recognizes his</b> stolen <b>vessels and scrolls in another’s possession, and a rumor had spread in the city</b> that the former had been the victim of <b>theft, the purchaser,</b> i.e., the one in possession of these items, <b>must take an oath to</b> the victim as to <b>how much</b> money <b>he spent</b> on the purchase, <b>and he</b> then <b>takes</b> that sum of money in exchange for returning the items. <b>And if no</b> such rumor had spread, <b>it is not in</b> the purported victim’s <b>power</b> to assert that the items were stolen, and he is not entitled to demand their return, <b>as I</b> could <b>say:</b> The items were never stolen; rather, the purported victim <b>sold them to another, and this</b> individual who currently possesses the item <b>purchased them from</b> that other person.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And if a rumor spread in the city</b> that he had been the victim of <b>theft, what of it? Let us suspect</b> that <b>perhaps he sold the items and he himself is spreading the rumor</b> that they were stolen so that he will be able to buy them back.
The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> The mishna is discussing a case <b>where people,</b> i.e., guests, <b>came into his house, and he arose at night and shouted [<i>vehifgin</i>], and said: My vessels have been stolen,</b> in which case it seems clear that he was the victim of theft. The Gemara rejects this rationale: On the contrary, the suspicion that he is lying should apply <b>all the more so,</b> as <b>he has found a pretext</b> for claiming that his property was stolen, and it should be suspected that he is taking advantage of the situation dishonestly.
<b>Rav Kahana</b> would <b>conclude this</b> <i>halakha</i> by stating <b>in the name of Rav:</b> The mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> a group of people spent the night in his house. And <b>there was a tunnel</b> that had been <b>burrowed into his house, and the people that stayed overnight</b> as guests <b>in his house left with bundles of vessels on their shoulders, and everyone says: So-and-so’s vessels were stolen.</b> In such a case, there is clear evidence that the homeowner was the victim of theft.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But perhaps</b> only <b>vessels were</b> stolen but <b>scrolls were not.</b> Why must the purchaser return the scrolls as well as the vessels? The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> everyone <b>is saying</b> that <b>scrolls</b> were <b>also</b> stolen.
The Gemara asks: <b>But let us suspect</b> that <b>perhaps</b> only <b>small</b> scrolls were taken, while <b>he is claiming</b> that <b>large</b> scrolls were stolen. If this is the case, he is claiming scrolls that do not belong to him. The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said:</b> The mishna is discussing a case where people <b>are saying: Such and such a scroll and such and such</b> a scroll were stolen, i.e., it is known which scrolls were taken from the homeowner.
The Gemara questions this as well: <b>But perhaps</b> the scrolls that were stolen <b>were old</b> and had therefore depreciated in value, while <b>he is claiming</b> that <b>new</b> scrolls were taken. If so, he is claiming scrolls that do not belong to him. <b>Rav said:</b> The mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> people <b>say</b> explicitly: <b>These are so-and-so’s vessels</b> and <b>these are so-and-so’s scrolls.</b> In this case it is known exactly which items were stolen.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rav</b> actually <b>say this? But doesn’t Rav</b> himself <b>say</b> that <b>a burglar</b> who came in <b>and took vessels and left is exempt</b> from paying for those items? <b>What is the reason</b> for this exemption? It is because <b>he purchases them with</b> his <b>blood.</b> Since a homeowner is allowed to kill a burglar, a burglar is exempt from returning the stolen items, based on the principle: One receives the greater punishment. Consequently, if the burglar himself is exempt, how can one who purchases an item from the burglar be required to return it?
The Gemara explains: <b>This matter, that</b> one who steals <b>acquires</b> what he stole, <b>applies</b> only <b>to a burglar, as he initially subjected himself to</b> be <b>killed</b> when he broke into the house. <b>But</b> concerning <b>these</b> thieves, who stayed overnight as guests of the homeowner, <b>since they did not</b> break into the house and thereby <b>subject themselves to</b> being <b>killed,</b> they are <b>not</b> exempt from returning the stolen item.
The Gemara notes that <b>Rava says: We taught</b> that all of these conditions must be met before the purchaser can be forced to return the item <b>only</b> with regard to <b>a homeowner who is wont to sell his vessels, but</b> with regard to <b>a homeowner who is not wont to sell his vessels,</b>

Daf 115a

one <b>does not need to pursue</b> the matter in <b>all this</b> detail.
The Gemara questions this ruling: <b>Perhaps he needed money, and he</b> therefore <b>sold</b> the items despite the fact that he does not generally sell his personal belongings. The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Ashi said: A rumor spread in the city</b> that he had been a victim of <b>theft.</b> It is reasonable to assume that he is the rightful owner, as he does not usually sell his belongings and it is common knowledge that he was the victim of theft.
§ Having assessed the mishna’s ruling with regard to a case where the thief remained unidentified, the Gemara discusses a case where the thief was found. <b>It was stated:</b> In a case where a thief <b>stole</b> an item <b>and sold</b> it, <b>and later the thief was identified, Rav says in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya:</b> The homeowner’s <b>claim</b> can be pursued only <b>with the first</b> one, i.e., the thief, but he has no claim against the purchaser. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> The homeowner’s <b>claim</b> can also be pursued <b>with the second</b> one, i.e., with the purchaser.
<b>Rav Yosef said:</b> Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>do not disagree. Here,</b> in the case about which Rabbi Yoḥanan issues his ruling, the item was purchased from the thief <b>before</b> the victim of the theft <b>despaired</b> of recovering the stolen item. Consequently, <b>the claim</b> can be pursued even <b>with the second</b> one, i.e., the purchaser. Conversely, <b>there,</b> in the case about which Rav issues his ruling, the item was purchased <b>after</b> the victim <b>despaired,</b> and therefore <b>the claim</b> can be pursued only <b>with the first</b> one, i.e., the thief.
Rav Yosef continues: <b>And both</b> Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan have accepted as <i>halakha</i> <b>the ruling of Rav Ḥisda</b> (111b), that if the owner had not yet despaired of retrieving his item, he can press his claim against either the thief or the purchaser.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>And</b> is it so that Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>do not disagree? Isn’t</b> a case involving <b>gifts</b> to which members <b>of the priesthood</b> are entitled <b>comparable</b> to a case of a stolen item that was sold <b>before</b> the onset of the owner’s <b>despair,</b> as the priest still hopes to receive the gifts, <b>and</b> yet Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagree</b> with regard to their legal status? This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 132a): If <b>one said to</b> a butcher: <b>Sell me the innards of a cow, and the gifts of the priesthood were in them,</b> the purchaser <b>must give</b> the gifts <b>to a priest, and</b> he <b>may not deduct</b> the value of the gifts <b>from the money</b> he agreed to pay the butcher. By contrast, if <b>he purchased</b> the innards <b>from</b> the butcher <b>by weight, he must give</b> the gifts <b>to a priest and</b> he <b>may deduct</b> the value of the gifts <b>from the money</b> he agreed to pay the butcher.
<b>And Rav says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only where</b> the purchaser <b>weighed</b> the innards <b>for himself, but</b> if <b>the butcher weighed</b> the innards <b>for him, the</b> priest’s <b>claim</b> may be pursued only <b>with the butcher.</b> The butcher is comparable to a thief when he sells the gifts of the priesthood to a non-priest, and Rav holds that the priest can press his claim only against the butcher. Similarly, in the case of the mishna he would hold that the owner can press his claim only against the thief and not against the purchaser.
The Gemara refutes Abaye’s objection: <b>Say</b> that Rav meant that the priest can <b>even</b> pursue his <b>claim with the butcher,</b> although he is certainly able to claim the gifts from the purchaser. And Rav had to teach this <b>lest you say</b> that <b>gifts of the priesthood are not</b> considered to have been <b>stolen</b> even if the butcher sells them, because wherever they are they remain the legal property of the priests. Rav therefore <b>teaches us</b> that they are considered to have been stolen in this case, and therefore the priest can press his claim against the butcher.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according <b>to Abaye, who said</b> that Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagree, with regard to what</b> do they <b>disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: They disagree <b>with regard to</b> the ruling <b>of Rav Ḥisda.</b> Rav disagrees with Rav Ḥisda and rules that one is entitled to collect only from the thief, while Rabbi Yoḥanan accepts the ruling of Rav Ḥisda and allows one to collect from either the thief or the purchaser.
The Gemara presents another explanation of the dispute between Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Rav Zevid said</b> that both agree that if the owner has not yet despaired of retrieving his item, he can press his claim against either party. They disagree in a case <b>where the owners despaired</b> of retrieving it only after the item was already <b>in the possession of the purchaser, but they did not</b> yet <b>despair</b> when it was <b>in the possession of the thief.</b>
<b>And it is with regard to this</b> that <b>they disagree:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>holds</b> that if there is <b>despair</b> on the part of the owner <b>and afterward</b> there is <b>a change in possession</b> of a stolen item, e.g., it leaves the possession of the thief and enters the possession of a purchaser, the purchaser <b>acquires</b> the item. By contrast, if there is first <b>a change in possession</b> of a stolen item <b>and afterward</b> there is <b>despair</b> on the part of the owner, then the purchaser does <b>not acquire</b> the item. Since in this case the owner did not despair until after the change of possession from the thief to the purchaser, the purchaser did not legally acquire the item, and the owner can press his claim against him. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that there <b>is no difference</b> whether the despair or change of possession came first. As long as the owner has despaired of recovering his item, it becomes the property of the purchaser, and the owner cannot demand that he return it.
The Gemara presents a third explanation of the dispute: <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>with regard to</b> a stolen <b>cloak</b> itself, <b>everyone agrees that it</b> must be <b>returned</b> by the purchaser <b>to its owner. But here, it is with regard to</b> whether the Sages <b>implemented the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case that Rav and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>disagree.</b>
<b>Rav says in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> that <b>the claim</b> can be pursued only <b>with the first</b> one, i.e., the thief, meaning that <b>the law with regard to the purchaser</b> is <b>that,</b> after returning the item to its owner, <b>he can collect money</b> only <b>from the thief, and</b> the Sages <b>did not implement the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yannai</b> that <b>the claim</b> of the purchaser can be pursued <b>with the second one,</b> meaning that <b>the law with regard to the purchaser</b> is that <b>he can</b> also <b>collect</b> the <b>money from the owner</b> when he returns the item to him, <b>and</b> the Sages <b>did implement the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case.
The Gemara questions this answer: <b>And did Rav hold</b> that the Sages <b>did not implement the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case? <b>But wasn’t Rav Huna a student of Rav, and</b> yet when a certain thief known as <b>Ḥanan the Wicked stole a cloak and</b> then <b>sold it,</b> and the case <b>came before Rav Huna, he said to that man</b> from whom the cloak was stolen: <b>Go redeem your pledge</b> from the purchaser, i.e., reimburse the purchaser for the garment that he returned to you. Evidently, Rav’s own student held that the Sages did allow a purchaser to claim reimbursement from the owner.
The Gemara answers that <b>Ḥanan the Wicked is different. Since</b> he has no money, <b>there is no</b> way for the purchaser <b>to collect payment from him,</b> and the case is therefore <b>comparable</b> to a case where the thief <b>was not identified,</b> with regard to which case the Sages implemented the provision ensuring the integrity of the marketplace.
<b>Rava says: If he is a well-known thief,</b> the Sages <b>did not implement the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case. The purchaser should have been aware that the item may be stolen and should not have purchased it. The Gemara asks: <b>But wasn’t Ḥanan the Wicked well known, and</b> yet, according to Rav Huna, the Sages <b>implemented the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case? The Gemara answers: <b>Although</b> he was <b>well known for villainy,</b> he was <b>not well known for theft.</b>
§ The Gemara continues to examine the provision ensuring the integrity of the marketplace. <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to one who <b>stole and repaid his debt</b> with the stolen item, or one who <b>stole and repaid his</b> debt from <b>credit</b> that was extended to him with the stolen item, the Sages <b>did not implement the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case, <b>as they say</b> to the creditor: <b>It was not with the expectation of</b> receiving <b>these</b> stolen items <b>that you gave</b> the debtor <b>anything.</b>
With regard to the integrity of the marketplace, it was also stated that if a thief provided a stolen item <b>worth two hundred</b> dinars as <b>collateral for</b> a loan of <b>one hundred</b> dinars, the Sages <b>implemented the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case. Consequently, the creditor is entitled to reimbursement from the owner for returning the collateral. If the collateral and the loan were <b>of equal value, Ameimar said:</b> The Sages <b>did not implement the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case, while <b>Mar Zutra said:</b> The Sages <b>did implement the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case.
The Gemara comments: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Mar Zutra that the Sages <b>did implement the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case.
The Gemara examines other applications of this provision: In <b>a sale,</b> if the stolen item was purchased <b>for an amount equal</b> to its actual market value, the Sages <b>implemented the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case. If a stolen item <b>worth one hundred</b> dinars was purchased <b>at</b> the price of <b>two hundred</b> dinars, <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> The Sages <b>did not implement the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case, while <b>Rava says:</b> The Sages <b>did implement the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case.
The Gemara states: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>in all these</b> cases the Sages <b>implemented the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace, except</b> with regard to one who <b>stole and repaid his debt</b> with the stolen item and one who <b>stole and repaid his</b> debt from <b>credit</b> that was extended to him with the stolen item.
The Gemara recounts a related incident: <b>Avimi bar Nazi, the father-in-law of Ravina, was owed four dinars by a certain man,</b> who then <b>stole a cloak and brought it to</b> Avimi as repayment for the loan. Avimi then <b>lent him four additional dinars. In the end, the thief was identified</b> as the debtor, and the case <b>came before Ravina</b> to determine whether or not the owner would have to pay Avimi for returning the cloak.
Ravina <b>said</b> to Avimi: With regard to the <b>first</b> four dinars that were lent, the thief is viewed as one who <b>stole and repaid his debt, and</b> the owner is <b>not required to give anything</b> in exchange for the garment’s return as the Sages’ ordinance ensuring the integrity of the marketplace does not apply in such a case. With regard to <b>those four additional dinars, take your money</b> from the owner of the cloak <b>and return the cloak</b> to him. Since Avimi lent the second set of dinars only because he had received the cloak, Ravina ruled that the Sages’ ordinance applied to him.
<b>Rav Kohen objects to this: But perhaps the cloak was given</b> to Avimi only in payment <b>for these first</b> four <b>dinars,</b> and it was a case of a thief who <b>stole and repaid his debt</b> or who <b>stole and repaid his</b> debt from <b>credit</b> that was extended to him with the stolen item. <b>And the latter four dinars</b> were loaned because Avimi <b>trusted the debtor, just as he trusted him initially,</b> when he lent the first four dinars. The cloak was not collateral for the second loan, and therefore the Sages’ ordinance should not apply. <b>The matter circulated</b> until <b>it came before Rabbi Abbahu,</b> who <b>said:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Kohen.</b>
The Gemara recounts another incident: <b>A resident of Naresh stole a scroll</b> and <b>sold it to a resident of Pappunya for eighty dinars. The resident of Pappunya</b> then <b>went and sold it to a resident of Meḥoza for one hundred and twenty dinars. In the end, the thief was identified</b> and <b>Abaye said: The</b> original <b>owner of the scroll should go and give the resident of Meḥoza eighty dinars and take his scroll</b> in return. <b>And</b> afterward, <b>the resident of Meḥoza should go and take</b> the remaining <b>forty</b> dinars <b>from the resident of Pappunya.</b>
<b>Rava objects to this: Now</b> that it has been established that with regard to one who <b>purchases from a thief,</b> the Sages <b>implemented the provision</b> ensuring <b>the integrity of the marketplace in this</b> case despite the fact that he dealt with the thief directly, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that the same would apply to one who <b>purchased</b> a stolen item <b>from a purchaser?</b> Accordingly, the final purchaser is entitled to receive from the original owner the full amount that he paid for the item.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>the</b> original <b>owner of the scroll should go and give the resident of Meḥoza one hundred and twenty dinars and take his scroll</b> in return. <b>And</b> afterward <b>the</b> original <b>owner of the scroll should go and collect forty</b> dinars <b>from the resident of Pappunya and eighty</b> dinars <b>from the resident of Naresh,</b> as each profited from the sale in these amounts, respectively.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a situation where <b>this</b> individual <b>came with his barrel of wine, and that</b> individual <b>came with his jug of honey,</b> if <b>the barrel of honey cracked and this</b> first individual <b>poured</b> out <b>his wine and salvaged the</b> other’s <b>honey,</b> which is worth more than the wine, by collecting it <b>into</b> his wine barrel,

Daf 115b

the owner of the wine <b>has</b> the right to collect <b>only his wage,</b> i.e., compensation for the effort he put into salvaging the honey. He is not, however, entitled to compensation for the wine itself. <b>But if</b> the owner of the wine <b>said: I will salvage your</b> honey <b>and you will pay me the value of my</b> wine, the owner of the honey is <b>obligated to pay him</b> compensation for the wine.
Similarly, if <b>a river washed away his donkey and the donkey of another,</b> and <b>his</b> donkey was <b>worth one hundred dinars and</b> the donkey <b>of the other</b> was <b>worth two hundred, and</b> the individual with the less valuable donkey <b>abandoned his</b> donkey <b>and</b> instead <b>salvaged</b> the donkey <b>of the other, he has</b> the right to collect <b>only his wage,</b> i.e., compensation for the effort he put into salvaging his fellow’s donkey. <b>But if he said to</b> the owner of the more valuable donkey: <b>I will salvage your</b> donkey <b>and you will pay me the</b> monetary value <b>of mine</b> in exchange, the owner of the more valuable donkey is <b>obligated to pay</b> the rescuer compensation for his donkey.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>And why</b> does one who pours out wine have the right to collect only this wage? <b>Let him say to</b> the owner of the honey: <b>I have acquired</b> your honey <b>from ownerless</b> property. <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who was laden</b> with <b>jugs of wine and jugs of oil and saw that they were breaking</b> and their contents were leaking out should <b>not say: This is hereby</b> separated as <b><i>teruma</i> and tithe for</b> the <b>produce that I have in my house. And</b> even <b>if he said</b> this, it is as though <b>he did not say anything.</b> The fact that one cannot separate produce that is about to be lost as <i>teruma</i> or tithe indicates that such property is considered ownerless.
The Gemara answers that it is <b>as Rabbi Yirmeya says</b> in a different context, that the ruling discussed there is referring to a case <b>where the basket of the olive press</b> was <b>wrapped around it</b> so that the barrel would not break completely, and some of the contents would remain inside. <b>So too,</b> here, the mishna issued its ruling only <b>when the basket of the olive press</b> was <b>wrapped around</b> the honey barrel so that it would not break completely, and the contents are therefore not rendered ownerless.
The Gemara challenges the <i>baraita</i> that stated: <b>And</b> even <b>if he said</b> that the wine or oil is separated as <i>teruma</i> or tithe, it is as though <b>he did not say anything. But isn’t it taught</b> in a different <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one was traveling on the road and had money in his possession, and</b> he saw <b>a ruffian</b> moving <b>toward him,</b> he <b>should not say: The</b> second-tithe <b>produce that I have in my house is hereby desacralized onto these coins,</b> i.e., the sanctity of the produce is hereby transferred to the coins. <b>But if he said</b> so, <b>his statement stands,</b> and the produce is desacralized while the coins attain the sanctity of the second tithe.
The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where he is capable of saving</b> his money from the ruffian and that is why he may transfer the sanctity of the second tithe to the coins. The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where he is capable of saving</b> the money, <b>why should he not say</b> that the produce should be desacralized <b><i>ab initio</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: It is a case <b>where he is capable of saving</b> the money only <b>with difficulty.</b> Consequently, he should not transfer the sanctity of the second tithe to the coins, as it may be lost; but if he does so, the transfer takes effect, as it is not certain that the money will be lost.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>wherever there is</b> a potential <b>loss one should not say</b> that the sanctity is transferred to the money <b><i>ab initio</i>? But isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in the following <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one had ten barrels of ritually impure, untithed</b> wine, i.e., first-tithe wine from which the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe had not yet been separated, <b>and he saw that one of them had broken</b> and that its contents were leaking out, <b>or that it had been exposed</b> and is forbidden for consumption, <b>he may say: This</b> barrel <b>is hereby</b> separated as <b>the <i>teruma</i> of the tithe for the other nine</b> barrels. <b>But with regard to oil, he should not do so due to the priest’s loss.</b>
The Gemara answers that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> issued its ruling only <b>when</b> the <b>basket of the olive press</b> was <b>wrapped around</b> the barrel so that some of its contents would remain inside. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> this rationale applies to a barrel <b>that was broken,</b> as the remaining contents are still <b>fit</b> for use, <b>but</b> with regard to a barrel that was <b>exposed, for what</b> use <b>is it fit?</b>
<b>And if you would say</b> that the exposed wine is <b>fit for sprinkling,</b> in order to spread its pleasant aroma, <b>isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in the following <i>baraita</i>? With regard to <b>water that was exposed, one may not pour it</b> out <b>in the public domain, nor mix clay with it, nor settle</b> dust <b>with it</b> by sprinkling it in <b>a house, nor give it to his animal to drink, nor</b> give it <b>to the animal of another.</b> This proves that exposed liquids may not be used even for sprinkling.
The Gemara answers: The wine is fit for use <b>because he passed it through a strainer,</b> and it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A vessel covered with <b>a strainer is subject to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>exposure</b> if the vessel is left unsupervised. <b>Rabbi Neḥemya said: When</b> is this so? It is so <b>when the lower vessel,</b> in which the liquid collects after passing through the strainer, <b>is exposed. But when the lower vessel is covered, even if the upper vessel is exposed, it is not subject to</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>exposure, because the venom of a snake is like a sponge</b> in that <b>it floats and stays in place.</b>
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to</b> Rabbi Neḥemya’s ruling that <b>Rabbi Simon says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: They taught</b> Rabbi Neḥemya’s ruling <b>only where one did not mix it, but</b> if <b>one mixed</b> the wine, any venom found in it becomes capable of penetrating the strainer? Consequently, the wine remains <b>forbidden</b> even if it is passed through a strainer.
The Gemara answers: <b>There, too, it is possible</b> to prevent the venom from mixing with the wine <b>by placing something upon the mouth of a barrel that will filter it</b> slowly so that the venom will not penetrate the strainer, and the wine may therefore be used.
It has now been established that the <i>baraita</i>, which states that if one’s barrel of untithed, impure wine is breaking, he may separate it as <i>teruma</i> of the tithe for other barrels of untithed, impure wine, may be explained in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Neḥemya. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Neḥemya, may we separate <i>teruma</i></b> from impure produce for other impure produce?
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may separate <i>teruma</i> from</b> produce that is <b>impure for</b> other produce that is <b>impure, and from</b> produce that is <b>pure for</b> other produce that is <b>pure, and from</b> produce that is <b>pure for</b> produce that is <b>impure, but not from</b> produce that is <b>impure for</b> produce that is <b>pure. Rabbi Neḥemya says: Even</b> with regard to separating <b>from</b> produce that is <b>impure for</b> produce that is <b>impure,</b> the Sages <b>permitted one to separate <i>teruma</i></b> in this manner <b>only in the case of doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>].</b> Consequently, how can the aforementioned <i>baraita</i> unequivocally permit one to separate impure wine as <i>teruma</i> of the tithe for other impure wine? The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, it is discussing <b>a case of <i>demai</i>.</b>
The Gemara discusses the continuation of the <i>baraita</i> cited previously: <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But with regard to oil, he should not do so, due to the priest’s loss.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about a leaking barrel of impure <b>oil,</b> which one may not separate as <i>teruma</i>, because if he does so the priest will suffer a loss? That case is different <b>because</b> the impure <i>teruma</i> oil <b>is fit</b> to be used <b>to kindle</b> a fire, and the priest will now not receive that oil. The Gemara challenges: But <b>wine is also fit</b> to be used, as the priest is able <b>to sprinkle</b> it in order to impart a pleasant aroma. Why is there is no concern that the priest will suffer a loss? <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>sprinkling is nothing,</b> i.e., it is insignificant, <b>doesn’t Shmuel say in the name of Rabbi Ḥiyya: One drinks from a <i>log</i></b> of wine worth one <b><i>sela</i>, and one sprinkles from a <i>log</i></b> of wine worth <b>two</b> <i>sela</i>, which indicates that there is greater benefit in sprinkling wine than in drinking it?
The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with new</b> wine that has not yet developed an aroma and is therefore not fit for sprinkling. The Gemara counters: <b>But isn’t it fit to</b> allow it to <b>age</b> so that it will become fit for sprinkling? The Gemara responds: If one waits for it to age, he might <b>come to</b> experience <b>a mishap with it,</b> as he will forget that it is impure <i>teruma</i>, which is forbidden for consumption.
The Gemara asks: <b>Oil</b> should <b>also</b> be subject to the concern that one might <b>come to experience a mishap with it,</b> as he might forget that it is forbidden and mistakenly drink it. The Gemara explains: The halakha is <b>that</b> the priest must <b>place</b> the oil <b>in a foul vessel,</b> and there is no concern that he will consume it, as such oil is used only for kindling. The Gemara asks: <b>Let the wine also be placed in a foul vessel,</b> in which case there would be no concern that he would drink it. The Gemara responds: <b>Now that he desires</b> to use <b>it for sprinkling, would he place it in a foul vessel?</b> This would ruin its aroma. Consequently, the wine may not be kept due to concern over a possible mishap, while the oil may be kept.
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> the concern with regard to <b>a mishap itself is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a barrel of <i>teruma</i> wine that became impure</b> and is therefore forbidden for consumption, <b>Beit Shammai say:</b>

Daf 116a

The wine must <b>all be poured out</b> in order to prevent a possible mishap. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> Let the wine <b>be used</b> for <b>sprinkling. Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: I will decide</b> the <i>halakha</i> by proposing an intermediate opinion: If the wine became impure <b>in a house, it may be used</b> for <b>sprinkling,</b> as it can be used immediately, <b>but</b> if it became impure <b>in the field, it must all be poured out,</b> as it is possible that by the time it is brought to the house and used for sprinkling, someone may drink it.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that he decided the <i>halakha</i> as follows: <b>With regard to aged</b> wine, <b>it may be used</b> for <b>sprinkling,</b> as it is fit to be sprinkled immediately, <b>but with regard to new</b> wine, which does not yet have a pleasant aroma, <b>it must all be poured out</b> in order to prevent a possible mishap. <b>They said to</b> Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei: <b>A decision</b> by <b>a third</b> party <b>does not</b> conclusively <b>decide</b> the <i>halakha</i>.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>if</b> the owner of the wine <b>said to</b> the owner of the honey: <b>I will salvage your</b> honey and you will pay me the value of my wine, the owner of the honey is obligated to give him compensation for the wine. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is the stipulation binding? <b>Let</b> the owner of the honey <b>say to him: I was</b> merely <b>fooling with you</b> when I accepted your condition, and I did not agree to it at all.
<b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case <b>where one was fleeing from prison and there was a ferry before him,</b> and <b>he said to</b> the ferryman: <b>Take</b> this entire <b>dinar and take me across</b> the river, the ferryman <b>has</b> the right to collect <b>only his</b> usual <b>wage,</b> but not the entire dinar. <b>Apparently,</b> the prisoner could have <b>said to him: I was</b> merely <b>fooling with you</b> and never intended to pay you a full dinar. <b>Here also, let</b> the owner of the honey <b>say to</b> the owner of the wine: <b>I was</b> merely <b>fooling with you.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> case in the mishna <b>is not comparable</b> to the case cited above; <b>rather,</b> it is comparable <b>to the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>, which states: <b>And if he said to</b> the ferryman: <b>Take this dinar as your wage and take me across</b> the river, the prisoner must <b>give him his wage in the full amount,</b> i.e., the entire dinar.
<b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause,</b> which states that the ferryman receives only his regular wage, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> which states that he receives the full dinar? <b>Rami bar Ḥama said:</b> The latter clause deals <b>with a trapper who scoops fish from the sea,</b> i.e., a fisherman, <b>and he</b> can <b>say to</b> the prisoner: <b>You have caused me a loss</b> of <b>fish [<i>kavrei</i>]</b> worth <b>a dinar,</b> which I would have caught had I not taken you across the river. Similarly, in the case in the mishna, the owner of the wine sustains a financial loss in order to save the honey, and therefore he is entitled to the compensation that the owner of the honey agreed to pay.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>a river washed away his donkey and the donkey of the other</b> man, and <b>his donkey is worth one hundred dinars,</b> etc. The Gemara notes: <b>And it</b> is <b>necessary</b> to teach both the case of the barrels of wine and honey and the case of the donkeys, <b>as if it</b> had <b>taught us</b> only <b>the first</b> case, that of the wine and honey, it might be said that <b>it is</b> only <b>there,</b> in that case, <b>that when</b> the owner of the wine <b>states</b> his stipulation, the owner of the honey <b>gives him the value of</b> the <b>entire</b> loss. Why is this? It is <b>because</b> the wine <b>is lost through</b> the direct <b>action</b> of its owner. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the donkeys, <b>since</b> the donkey is lost <b>by itself</b> in the river, <b>let us say:</b> The one who salvages the donkey of his fellow <b>has</b> the right to <b>only his wage,</b> i.e., compensation for his labor.
<b>And if</b> the mishna had <b>taught us</b> only the case of <b>the latter clause,</b> it might be said: <b>It is here,</b> in the case of the donkeys, <b>that</b> if the intention of the one who saved the donkey was <b>unspecified,</b> i.e., he did not stipulate that the owner of the other donkey would compensate him for the loss of his own donkey, he <b>has</b> the right to <b>only his wage, because</b> the donkey is lost <b>by itself. But there,</b> where the barrel of wine is lost <b>through</b> the direct <b>action</b> of its owner, one might <b>say: Even in</b> a case where the intention of the owner of the wine was <b>unspecified,</b> the owner of the honey must <b>give him the value of</b> the <b>entire</b> barrel of wine. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, both cases are <b>necessary.</b>
The Gemara cites a relevant discussion. <b>Rav Kahana raised a dilemma before Rav:</b> If one <b>descended</b> into the river <b>to rescue</b> another’s donkey instead of his own after stipulating that he would be compensated for the loss of his own donkey, <b>and his</b> own donkey <b>emerged</b> from the river <b>by itself, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the rescuer still entitled to payment from the owner of the donkey that he saved, despite the fact that he did not suffer a monetary loss? Rav <b>said to him:</b> The rescuer is still compensated because it was <b>from Heaven</b> that <b>mercy was bestowed upon him,</b> and his good fortune does not affect the stipulation.
This <b>is like that</b> case where <b>Rav Safra was traveling in a caravan,</b> and <b>a certain lion</b> followed them, <b>accompanying them</b> along the way. <b>Every night,</b> the travelers <b>would send one of their donkeys to</b> the lion, <b>and</b> the lion <b>would eat</b> it. <b>When Rav Safra’s time arrived</b> to provide the lion with prey, <b>he sent it</b> his <b>donkey but</b> the lion <b>did not eat it. Rav Safra went ahead and acquired it</b> back, as his donkey had become ownerless when he presented it to the lion. Although Rav Safra did not lose his donkey, he had fulfilled his obligation to provide the lion with a donkey, and his good fortune did not affect his obligation vis-à-vis the other travelers.
With regard to this episode, <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: Why</b> was it necessary <b>for him to acquire</b> the donkey again? <b>Although</b> Rav Safra <b>made it ownerless</b> by sending it to the lion, it was <b>made ownerless</b> only <b>with the intention that the lion</b> would consume it, but <b>it was not made ownerless with the intention that everyone</b> else could acquire it. Accordingly, no one else could have acquired the donkey. Ravina <b>said to him: Rav Safra did</b> so <b>as an added precaution.</b>
<b>Rav raised a dilemma before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: If one <b>descended</b> into the river in order <b>to rescue</b> another’s donkey instead of his own, <b>but</b> he <b>did not</b> manage to <b>rescue</b> it, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does the stipulation still apply so that the owner of the donkey he attempted to rescue must compensate him for the loss of his own donkey? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: And is this a question?</b> It is clear that <b>he has</b> the right to collect <b>only his wage,</b> but he is not entitled to the value of his own donkey.
Rav <b>raised an objection to</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s ruling from a <i>baraita</i>: In a case of <b>one who hires a laborer</b>

Daf 116b

<b>to bring cabbage and plums to an ill</b> person, <b>and he went and found that</b> the patient had already <b>died or recovered,</b> the employer nevertheless <b>gives</b> the worker <b>his entire wage.</b> Evidently, one is paid for his efforts even if the desired result is not accomplished. Accordingly, the rescuer’s stipulation should apply, and one should be obligated to pay another for attempting to salvage his donkey even if he did not actually succeed in doing so.
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: Are</b> those two cases <b>comparable? There,</b> in the case of the ill person, <b>the agent performed his assignment,</b> as he procured and delivered the foods to the ill person, but <b>here,</b> in the case of the donkeys, <b>the agent did not perform his assignment,</b> as he was unable to rescue the animal from the river.
§ Apropos the episode involving Rav Safra, the Gemara discusses the division of expenses among travelers in a caravan. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a caravan that was traveling in the desert and a troop</b> of bandits <b>stood over it</b> in order <b>to</b> attack and <b>pillage</b> it, and the members of the caravan agreed to pay ransom to the bandits, they <b>calculate</b> each traveler’s contribution <b>according to</b> the amount of <b>money</b> he is carrying, <b>and</b> they <b>do not calculate according to</b> the number of <b>souls</b> in the caravan, i.e., the expense is not divided equally among the travelers.
<b>But if they hired a scout who travels in front of them</b> and leads them safely through the desert, the travelers <b>calculate</b> each one’s contribution to paying the scout’s wages <b>even according to</b> the number of <b>souls. And they should not differ from the</b> usual <b>custom of donkey drivers,</b> who often have set procedures for such situations.
<b>The donkey drivers are permitted to stipulate that</b> with regard to <b>anyone whose donkey becomes lost,</b> the caravan <b>will provide him</b> with <b>a different donkey.</b> If the donkey was lost <b>through negligence, they do not provide him</b> with another donkey, but if it was lost <b>not through negligence, they provide him</b> with another donkey. <b>And if</b> the individual whose donkey became lost <b>said: Give me</b> money instead of the donkey <b>and I will guard</b> the caravan along with everyone else, <b>they do not listen to him.</b>
The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious? No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this for a case <b>where he</b> already <b>has another donkey, lest you say</b> that <b>he will guard</b> the caravan <b>for its</b> sake. Since he still owns one donkey, he never lost his incentive to guard the caravan, and the other drivers should therefore give him money if he wishes. The <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that <b>guarding one</b> donkey <b>is different from guarding two</b> donkeys, and the driver will be more likely to guard the caravan properly if they supply him with another donkey.
§ The Gemara cites another <i>baraita</i> that discusses the division of expenses among a group. <b>The Sages taught:</b> In a case of <b>a boat that was traveling on the sea</b> when <b>a gale arose</b> and threatened <b>to sink it, and</b> the sailors <b>lightened its load</b> by throwing some of their belongings overboard, the sailors <b>calculate</b> the amount that each must throw out <b>according to weight, but</b> they <b>do not calculate</b> it <b>according to</b> how much <b>money</b> the items are worth. <b>And they should not differ from the</b> usual <b>custom of sailors.</b>
<b>And</b> if a number of boats are traveling together, <b>the sailors are permitted to stipulate that</b> with regard to <b>anyone whose boat was lost,</b> the others <b>will provide him</b> with <b>a different boat.</b> If <b>his</b> boat <b>was lost through negligence,</b> the other sailors <b>do not provide</b> him with another boat, but if it was lost <b>not through negligence,</b> the sailors <b>provide him</b> with another boat. <b>And if</b> the boat <b>sailed to a place where the boats do not travel,</b> the other sailors <b>do not provide</b> him with a different boat.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary because in</b> the month of <b>Nisan,</b> the boats <b>distance</b> themselves from the shore by <b>one rope</b> length, <b>and in</b> the month of <b>Tishrei,</b> they <b>distance</b> themselves by <b>two rope</b> lengths. <b>And</b> in this case, the boat <b>was traveling during Nisan</b> and sailed <b>to the place</b> where boats sail during <b>Tishrei. Lest you say</b> that the sailor is not considered negligent because he <b>is taking his</b> usual <b>route and traveling</b> as he is accustomed to, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that his actions are considered negligent.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case of <b>a caravan that was traveling in the desert and a troop</b> of bandits <b>stood</b> over it <b>and pillaged it, and one of</b> the travelers <b>arose and rescued</b> the caravan from the bandits, <b>he has rescued</b> the property <b>for the common</b> good, i.e., each member of the caravan receives back his property. <b>And if he stated: I will rescue</b> the property from the bandits <b>for myself,</b> then <b>he has</b> effectively <b>rescued</b> the items <b>for himself,</b> and he is now the legal owner of all the property.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case? <b>If</b> each member of the caravan is <b>able to rescue</b> his property, then <b>even</b> in the <b>latter clause,</b> where the rescuer states that he is saving the property for himself, the <i>halakha</i> should <b>also</b> be that the possessions are rescued <b>for the common</b> good, as the other members of the caravan did not despair of retrieving their property. <b>And if</b> each member of the caravan is <b>unable to rescue</b> his property, they despair of retrieving their property and relinquish ownership of it. Consequently, <b>even</b> in the <b>first clause,</b> the <i>halakha</i> should <b>also</b> be that the possessions are saved <b>for himself,</b> so that he is their legal owner. Why is there a discrepancy between the <i>halakha</i> in the first clause and the <i>halakha</i> in the latter clause?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rami bar Ḥama said: Here,</b> in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>we are dealing with</b> a caravan whose members are <b>partners</b> and jointly own the confiscated property, <b>and</b> in a case <b>such as this, a partner may divide</b> the property <b>without the other</b> partner’s <b>consent.</b> Therefore, if <b>he said</b> that he intends to save the property for himself, <b>he has</b> dissolved the partnership and <b>divided</b> the property so that if he is able to rescue only some of the property, the property he rescues is his share of the joint property. If <b>he did not say</b> that he intends to save the property for himself, <b>he has not divided</b> the property, and whatever he rescues is jointly owned by the partners.
<b>Rava stated</b> a different answer: <b>Here,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>we are dealing with laborers</b> who were hired to protect the caravan, and one of these guards saved the travelers’ property. <b>And it is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, as Rav says: A laborer may retract</b> his commitment to his employer <b>even in the middle of the day.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>As long as he did not retract</b> his commitment, he is <b>considered</b> to be under the <b>jurisdiction of the employer,</b> so that anything he saves automatically belongs to the employer. <b>And when he retracts</b> his commitment, <b>it is</b> for <b>a different reason</b> that he is able to do so, <b>as it is written: “For unto Me the children of Israel are servants”</b> (Leviticus 25:55), indicating that Jews are servants of God, <b>but not servants of servants,</b> i.e., of other Jews. Consequently, it is permitted for a laborer to conclude his term of employment whenever he wants. Once he does so, if he saves property that the members of the caravan are unable to rescue, the property belongs to him.
<b>Rav Ashi stated</b> another answer: The <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where</b> the other members of the caravan are <b>able to rescue</b> the property <b>with difficulty.</b> Therefore, if <b>he revealed his intention</b> to rescue the property for himself and the other travelers did not protest, it is clear that they have despaired of recovering their property, and the rescuer has secured the property <b>for himself.</b> If he <b>did not reveal his intention</b> to rescue the property for himself, the status quo remains and the property has been rescued <b>for the common</b> good.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>one who robs a field from an-other and thugs [<i>massikin</i>]</b> subsequently <b>take</b> the field from the robber, the <i>halakha</i> is dependent upon the circumstances: <b>If it is a regional disaster</b> in which the thugs seize all the property in the region, the robber <b>says to</b> the owner of the field: <b>That which is yours is before you,</b> i.e., it is your prerogative to try to reclaim it from the thugs. No compensation is required since the thugs would have seized the property in any event. But <b>if</b> the thugs took that field alone <b>due to the robber,</b> the robber is <b>obligated to provide</b> the owner with <b>a different field.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: One who teaches</b> the mishna using the term <b><i>massikin</i> does not err, and one who teaches</b> the mishna using the term <b><i>matzikin</i></b> also <b>does not err,</b> as both terms may be used to refer to thugs. <b>One who teaches</b> the mishna using the term <b><i>matzikin</i> does not err, as it is written: “In the siege and in the distress [<i>matzok</i>]</b> with which your enemies shall distress you” (Deuteronomy 28:55). Consequently, <i>matzikin</i> are individuals who cause distress to others.
<b>And one who teaches</b> the mishna using the term <b><i>massikin</i> does not err, as it is written:</b> “All your trees and the fruit of your land <b>shall the locust consume”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:42), <b>and,</b> in the standard Aramaic translation, <b>we translate</b> this phrase as: <b>Shall the locust [<i>sakke’a</i>] consume.</b> Consequently, <i>massikin</i> are those who consume the property of others.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>If</b> the thugs took the field <b>due to the robber,</b> the robber is <b>obligated</b> to provide the owner with a different field. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case in the latter clause of the mishna? <b>If we say</b> that <b>they seized</b> only <b>his land,</b> i.e., the robber’s land, <b>and did not seize all</b> the other <b>lands</b> in the region, <b>you already learned this from the first clause</b> of the mishna: <b>If it is a regional disaster</b> in which the thugs seize all the property in the region, the robber is not obligated to compensate the owner of the field, which indicates that <b>if it is not</b> a regional disaster, the robber is <b>not</b> exempt from payment. What novelty does the latter clause teach?
The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for a case <b>where</b> the individual did not actually take control of the property before it was seized by the thugs, but rather <b>showed</b> the field to the thugs and thereby facilitated their occupation of the field. <b>A different version</b> of this answer is as follows: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> A case <b>where gentiles coerced</b> someone <b>and told him to show them his land</b> for them to seize, <b>and he showed</b> them <b>that</b> field belonging to another, <b>along with</b> his own fields, and the thugs then seized all the land he showed them.
The Gemara recounts a related incident: There was <b>a certain man who showed piles of wheat,</b> belonging <b>to the Exilarch’s household,</b> to thugs, who seized them. The case <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> for judgment, and <b>Rav Naḥman deemed</b> that man <b>liable to pay</b> the Exilarch for the stolen wheat. <b>Rav Yosef was sitting behind Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya, and Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya was sitting before Rav Naḥman. Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya said to Rav Naḥman:</b> Did you deem him liable to pay because that is <b>the <i>halakha</i>, or</b> was it <b>a fine?</b>
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him:</b> This individual’s liability <b>is</b> written explicitly in <b>the mishna,</b> i.e., it is the <i>halakha</i>, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>If</b> thugs took the field <b>due to the robber,</b> he is <b>obligated to provide</b> the owner with a different <b>field. And it was established</b> that the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> an individual <b>showed</b> the field to thugs, who later seized it. So too, in this case, the one who showed the Exilarch’s wheat pile to the thugs is obligated to pay for them. <b>After</b> Rav Naḥman <b>left, Rav Yosef said to Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya: What difference does it make to you</b>

Daf 117a

<b>if</b> it is <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> or <b>if</b> it is <b>a fine?</b> Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya <b>said to him: If</b> it is <b>the <i>halakha</i>, we learn from it</b> and apply this ruling to other cases, but <b>if</b> it is <b>a fine, we do not learn from it,</b> as it is possible that Rav Naḥman had a specific reason to impose a fine in this case.
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do you say that we do not learn from</b> the imposition of <b>a fine</b> in one case and apply the ruling in other cases? The Gemara answers that the source is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Initially,</b> the Sages <b>would say</b> that <b>one who renders</b> another’s food <b>ritually impure,</b> thereby rendering it unfit for him to consume, <b>and one who pours</b> another’s wine as <b>a libation</b> for idol worship, thereby rendering it an item from which deriving benefit is prohibited, are liable to pay the owner for the financial loss they caused despite the fact that damage is not evident. <b>Subsequently,</b> they added to this list, <b>to say</b> that <b>even one who intermingles</b> <i>teruma</i>, the portion of the produce designated for the priest, with another’s non-sacred produce, thereby rendering the non-sacred food forbidden to non-priests, is liable to compensate the owner for the loss of value of the produce, as fewer people will be willing to buy it from him.
The Gemara comments: It may be inferred from the <i>baraita</i> that it is only because the Sages <b>subsequently</b> added to the list that <b>yes,</b> one who intermingles <i>teruma</i> with another’s non-sacred produce must compensate him. But if <b>they had not subsequently</b> added to the list, he would <b>not</b> be liable. <b>What is the reason</b> that we do not learn that he is liable from the cases of one who renders another’s food impure or pours wine as a libation for idol worship, as this is also a case in which one causes damage that is not evident? <b>Is it not due to</b> the fact that his payment <b>is a fine, and</b> with regard to <b>a fine, we do not learn from</b> one case that it may be imposed in other circumstances?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this is not the reason. Rather, <b>initially</b> the Sages <b>maintained</b> that they <b>were concerned</b> with regard <b>to a large</b> financial <b>loss,</b> e.g., the cases of one who renders another’s food impure or pours his wine as a libation for idol worship, but with regard <b>to a small</b> financial <b>loss,</b> e.g., one who intermingles <i>teruma</i> with another’s non-sacred produce, <b>they were not concerned. And ultimately</b> the Sages <b>maintained</b> that they <b>were concerned</b> with regard <b>to a small loss as well</b> and imposed liability.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t the father of Rabbi Avin teach</b> the <i>baraita</i> as follows: <b>Initially they would say</b> that <b>one who renders</b> another’s produce <b>impure and one who intermingles</b> <i>teruma</i> with another’s non-sacred produce are both liable to pay for the financial loss that they caused, despite the fact that the damage is not evident. <b>Subsequently,</b> they added to this list, <b>to say</b> that <b>even one who pours</b> another’s wine as <b>a libation</b> for idol worship is <b>also</b> liable to pay a fine for the loss that he caused. It may be inferred that it is only because the Sages <b>subsequently</b> added to the list, that <b>yes,</b> one who pours the libation is liable. But if <b>they had not subsequently</b> added to the list, he would <b>not</b> be liable.
The Gemara comments: Since one who offers libations for idol worship causes a large financial loss, the rationale offered previously cannot apply to this version of the <i>baraita</i>. Accordingly, <b>what is the reason</b> that the liability for pouring another’s wine as a libation could not be extrapolated from the fine imposed for rendering another’s food impure or intermingling it with <i>teruma</i>? Is it <b>not due to</b> the fact that <b>we do not learn from</b> the imposition of <b>a fine</b> in one case that a fine may be imposed in other cases?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this is not the reason. Rather, the reason is that <b>initially</b> the Sages <b>held in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Avin, and ultimately they held in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yirmeya.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Initially they held in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Avin, as Rabbi Avin says:</b> If one stood in the public domain on Shabbat and <b>shot an arrow from the beginning of</b> an area measuring <b>four</b> cubits <b>to the end of</b> an area measuring <b>four</b> cubits, <b>and</b> the arrow <b>tore</b> another’s <b>silks [<i>shira’in</i>] in</b> the course of <b>its travel</b> through the air, the one who threw it is <b>exempt</b> from paying for the cloth. The reason for this is <b>that lifting</b> an item <b>is a necessity for placing</b> it elsewhere, and therefore the entire process, from when one shoots the arrow until it comes to a rest, is considered to be a single act. The one performing it is <b>liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty for violating Shabbat. One who performs a single act for which he is liable to receive the death penalty and is also liable to pay money receives only the death penalty. Similarly, one who pours another’s wine as a libation for idol worship incurs the death penalty, and is therefore exempt from paying for the wine.
<b>And ultimately they held</b> that the liabilities are not incurred simultaneously, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yirmeya, as Rabbi Yirmeya says: From the time of the lifting,</b> the thief <b>acquires</b> the wine and is therefore immediately <b>liable</b> to pay <b>money to</b> the owner. But <b>he is not liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty <b>until the time</b> that he pours the <b>libation.</b> Once the Sages concluded that the liabilities are not incurred simultaneously, they ruled that one who pours another’s wine as a libation for idol worship is liable to reimburse him.
§ The Gemara returns to the matter of one who showed another’s field to thugs. <b>Rav Huna bar Yehuda happened</b> to come <b>to</b> the town of <b>Bei Abiyonei</b> and <b>came before Rava,</b> who <b>said to him: Did any</b> legal <b>incident come to you</b> for judgment recently? Rav Huna bar Yehuda <b>said to him:</b> There was a case of <b>a Jew whom gentiles coerced and,</b> as a result <b>he showed</b> them <b>property</b> belonging to <b>another,</b> which the gentiles later seized. He <b>came to me</b> for judgment, <b>and I deemed</b> him <b>liable</b> to compensate the owner for the loss.
Rava <b>said to</b> Rav Huna bar Yehuda: <b>Reverse</b> your decision in this <b>case</b> and return the money <b>to its owner,</b> i.e., the thug, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a Jew whom gentiles coerced and,</b> as a result <b>he showed</b> them <b>property</b> belonging to <b>another</b> that the gentiles later seized, he is <b>exempt</b> from reimbursing the owner of the property. <b>But if he</b> actively <b>took</b> the property <b>and gave</b> it to the gentiles <b>by</b> his own <b>hand,</b> he is <b>liable</b> to compensate the owner.
The Gemara adds that <b>Rabba says: If he showed</b> the gentiles the property <b>of his own</b> volition, it is <b>as though he</b> actively <b>took</b> the property <b>and gave</b> it to the gentiles <b>by</b> his own <b>hand,</b> and he is liable to compensate the owner.
The Gemara recounts another incident: There was <b>a certain man that gentiles</b> had <b>coerced and</b> so <b>he showed them the wine of Rav Mari, son of Rav Pineḥas, son of Rav Ḥisda, and</b> the gentiles <b>said to him: Carry</b> the wine <b>and bring it with us.</b> Complying with the gentiles, <b>he carried and brought</b> it <b>with them.</b> The case <b>came before Rav Ashi,</b> and he <b>exempted</b> the man from compensating Rav Mari for the wine.
<b>The Rabbis said to Rav Ashi: But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> he <b>took</b> the property <b>and manually transferred</b> it to the gentiles, he is <b>liable</b> to compensate the owner? Rav Ashi <b>said to them: That statement applies</b> only in a case <b>where</b> the Jew <b>did not bring</b> the gentiles <b>to</b> the property <b>at the outset; but if he brought</b> the gentiles <b>to</b> the property <b>at the outset,</b> it is as though <b>he</b> already <b>burned</b> it, as the gentiles then had access to the property. Since the damage inflicted by the Jew was committed by merely showing the wine to the gentiles, he is exempt from payment even though he later actively carried the wine with his hands.
<b>Rabbi Abbahu raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ashi</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where <b>a ruffian said to</b> a Jew: <b>Pass me this bundle of grain, or this cluster of grapes, and</b> the Jew <b>passed it to him,</b> the Jew is <b>liable</b> to pay the owner of the grain or the grapes. Since the ruffian was already present, it is evident from this <i>baraita</i> that one who hands over another’s property to a third party is liable despite the fact that the latter already had access to it. Rav Ashi answered: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the Jew and the ruffian were <b>standing on two</b> different <b>sides of a river,</b> so that the ruffian did not have access to the item when the Jew passed it to him.
The Gemara points out that the language of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is also precise</b> according to this explanation, <b>as it teaches</b> its ruling using the term: <b>Pass,</b> which indicates that the ruffian could not have reached the item himself, <b>and</b> it <b>did not teach</b> using the term: <b>Give,</b> which would indicate that the ruffian was standing next to the other individual. The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from</b> the language of the <i>baraita</i> that Rav Ashi’s interpretation is correct.
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain</b> fishing <b>net over which two</b> people <b>were quarreling. This one said: It is mine, and that one said: It is mine. One of them went and gave it to an officer [<i>lefarhagna</i>] of the king. Abaye said:</b> He is exempt from payment because <b>he can say</b> to the court: <b>When I gave</b> it to the official, <b>I gave</b> what is <b>mine. Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>And is it in his</b> power to do so when the ownership of the net is the subject of dispute? <b>Rather, Rava said: We excommunicate him until he brings</b> the net back <b>and stands in court</b> for adjudication.
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain man who desired to show another</b> individual’s <b>straw</b> to the gentile authorities, who would seize it. <b>He came before Rav,</b> who <b>said to him: Do not show</b> it <b>and do not show</b> it, i.e., you are absolutely prohibited from showing it. The man <b>said to him: I will show</b> it <b>and I will show</b> it, i.e., I will certainly show it. <b>Rav Kahana was sitting before Rav,</b> and, hearing the man’s disrespectful response, <b>he dislodged</b> the man’s <b>neck from him,</b> i.e., he broke his neck and killed him.
Seeing Rav Kahana’s action, <b>Rav read</b> the following verse <b>about him: “Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as an antelope in a net”</b> (Isaiah 51:20). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>this antelope, once it falls into the net,</b> the hunter <b>does not have mercy upon it, so too</b> with regard to <b>the money of a Jew, once it falls into the hand of gentiles, they do not have mercy upon him,</b> i.e., the Jew. Since gentiles who seek a Jew’s money will kill him in order to seize the property, Rav Kahana acted appropriately when he broke the miscreant’s neck, as he protected the Jew’s property and, by extension, the Jew himself.
<b>Rav</b> then <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>Kahana, until now there were Persian</b> rulers <b>who were not particular about bloodshed. But now there are Greeks who are particular about bloodshed, and they</b> will <b>say: Murder [<i>meradin</i>], murder,</b> and they will press charges against you. Therefore, <b>get up</b> and <b>ascend to Eretz Yisrael</b> to study there under Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>and accept upon yourself that you will not raise</b> any <b>difficulties to</b> the statements of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> for <b>seven years.</b>
Rav Kahana <b>went</b> to Eretz Yisrael and <b>found Reish Lakish, who was sitting and reviewing</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan’s <b>daily</b> lecture in the <b>academy for the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the students in the academy. When he finished, Rav Kahana <b>said to</b> the students: <b>Where is Reish Lakish? They said to him: Why</b> do you wish to see him? Rav Kahana <b>said to them:</b> I have <b>this difficulty and that difficulty</b> with his review of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s lecture, <b>and this resolution and that resolution</b> to the questions he raised. <b>They told</b> this to <b>Reish Lakish. Reish Lakish</b> then <b>went and said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: A lion has ascended from Babylonia,</b> and <b>the Master</b> ought <b>to examine</b> the discourse he will deliver <b>in the academy tomorrow,</b> as Rav Kahana may raise difficult questions about the material.
<b>The next day, they seated</b> Rav Kahana <b>in the first row, in front of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>stated a <i>halakha</i> and</b> Rav Kahana <b>did not raise a difficulty,</b> in accordance with Rav’s instruction. Rabbi Yoḥanan stated another <b><i>halakha</i> and</b> again, Rav Kahana <b>did not raise a difficulty.</b> As a result, <b>they placed</b> Rav Kahana further <b>back</b> by one row. This occurred until he had been moved back <b>seven rows, until he was seated in the last row. Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: The lion you mentioned has become a fox,</b> i.e., he is not knowledgeable.
Rav Kahana <b>said</b> to himself: <b>May it be</b> God’s <b>will that these seven rows</b> I have been moved <b>should replace the seven years that Rav told me</b> to wait before raising difficulties to the statements of Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>He stood up on his feet and said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: Let the <b>Master go back to the beginning</b> of the discourse and repeat what he said. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>stated a <i>halakha</i> and</b> Rav Kahana <b>raised a difficulty.</b> Therefore, <b>they placed him in the first row,</b> and again, Rav Yoḥanan <b>stated a <i>halakha</i>, and he raised a difficulty.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan was sitting upon seven cushions [<i>bistarkei</i>]</b> so that he could be seen by all the students, <b>and</b> since he could not answer Rav Kahana’s questions, <b>he removed one cushion from under himself</b> to demonstrate that he was lowering himself out of respect for Rav Kahana. He then <b>stated</b> another <b><i>halakha</i> and</b> Rav Kahana <b>raised</b> another <b>difficulty.</b> This happened repeatedly <b>until</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>removed all the cushions from underneath himself until he was sitting on the ground. Rabbi Yoḥanan was an old man and his eyebrows drooped</b> over his eyes. <b>He said to</b> his students: <b>Uncover my eyes for me and I will see</b> Rav Kahana, so <b>they uncovered</b> his eyes <b>for him with a silver eye brush.</b>
Once his eyes were uncovered, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>saw that</b> Rav Kahana’s <b>lips were split</b> and <b>thought</b> that Rav Kahana <b>was smirking at him.</b> As a result, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>was offended, and</b> Rav Kahana <b>died</b> as punishment for the fact that he offended Rabbi Yoḥanan. <b>The next day, Rabbi Yoḥanan said to the Rabbis,</b> his students: <b>Did you see how that Babylonian,</b> Rav Kahana, <b>behaved</b> in such a disrespectful manner? <b>They said to him: His</b> usual <b>manner</b> of appearance <b>is such,</b> and he was not mocking you. Hearing this, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>went up to</b> Rav Kahana’s burial <b>cave</b> and <b>saw</b> that <b>it was</b>

Daf 117b

<b>encircled by a serpent [<i>akhna</i>],</b> which had placed its tail in its mouth, completely encircling the cave and blocking the entrance. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to it: Serpent, serpent, open your mouth and</b> allow <b>the teacher</b> to <b>enter</b> and be <b>near the disciple, but</b> the serpent <b>did not open</b> its mouth to allow him entry. He then said: Allow <b>a colleague</b> to <b>enter</b> and be <b>near</b> his <b>colleague, but</b> still the serpent <b>did not open</b> its mouth. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Allow the <b>disciple</b> to <b>enter</b> and be <b>near the teacher,</b> referring to Rav Kahana as his own teacher. The snake then <b>opened</b> its mouth <b>for him</b> to allow him entry. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>requested</b> divine <b>mercy</b> from God and <b>raised</b> Rav Kahana from the dead.
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>Had I known that this was the Master’s manner</b> of appearance, <b>I would not have been offended. Now</b> let <b>the Master come with me</b> to the study hall. Rav Kahana <b>said to him: If you are able to request</b> divine <b>mercy</b> so <b>that I will not die again, I will go</b> with you, <b>and if not, I will not go</b> with you. The Gemara comments: <b>Since the time</b> decreed for his death <b>had passed, it had passed.</b>
Rabbi Yoḥanan then completely <b>awakened him</b> and <b>stood him up.</b> Thereafter, <b>he asked him</b> about <b>every uncertainty that he had, and</b> Rav Kahana <b>resolved</b> each of <b>them for him. And this is</b> the background to <b>that which Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> to his students on several occasions: What <b>I said was yours is</b> in fact <b>theirs,</b> i.e., I thought that the Torah scholars in Eretz Yisrael were the most advanced, but in fact the scholars of Babylonia are the most advanced, as evidenced by Rav Kahana’s knowledge.
§ The Gemara relates another incident pertaining to one who informed gentiles of the whereabouts of another Jew’s property. There was <b>a certain</b> individual <b>who showed Rabbi Abba’s silk [<i>ametakesa</i>]</b> to gentiles, who later seized it. <b>Rabbi Abbahu and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa sat</b> together to determine whether Rabbi Abba was entitled to compensation from the informer, <b>and Rabbi Ile’a sat next to them.</b>
The judges <b>thought to deem</b> the informer <b>liable</b> to reimburse Rabbi Abba <b>based upon that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 28b): If a judge <b>issued a judgment</b> and erred, and he <b>acquitted</b> one who was in fact <b>liable,</b> or <b>deemed liable</b> one who should have in fact been <b>acquitted,</b> or if he <b>ruled</b> that <b>a pure</b> item is <b>impure,</b> or <b>ruled</b> that <b>an impure</b> item is <b>pure,</b> and by doing so he caused a litigant a monetary loss, <b>what he did is done,</b> i.e., the judgment stands, <b>and</b> the judge <b>must pay</b> damages <b>from his home,</b> i.e., from his personal funds. This indicates that one is liable to pay for a financial loss that he causes even if his involvement was only through speech.
<b>Rabbi Ile’a said to them: This is</b> what <b>Rav says: And that</b> mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the judge not only issued a ruling, but actively <b>took</b> the money from the one whom he found liable, <b>and gave</b> it to the other party <b>by</b> his own <b>hand.</b> Consequently, it cannot serve as a precedent to render the informer liable in this case. The Sages serving as judges <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>Go to Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim and Rabbi Elazar ben Pedat, who rule</b> that there is <b>liability</b> for damage caused by <b>indirect</b> action.
Rabbi Abba <b>went to them,</b> and <b>they deemed</b> the informer <b>liable</b> to reimburse Rabbi Abba, as it is taught <b>in the mishna: If</b> the thugs seized the field <b>due to the robber, he is liable to provide</b> the owner with <b>a different field. And it was established that</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> an individual <b>showed</b> the field to thugs who later seized it. The <i>halakha</i> stated in the mishna would apply to this case as well.
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain man</b> with <b>whom a silver cup was deposited. Thieves came upon him</b> in his home and <b>he took</b> the cup and <b>gave it to them.</b> The case <b>came before Rabba,</b> and Rabba <b>exempted him</b> from payment. <b>Abaye said to him: This</b> individual is <b>saving himself with another’s property,</b> and he should therefore be liable. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said,</b> in explanation of Rabba’s ruling: <b>We look</b> at his financial status: <b>If</b> the bailee <b>is a wealthy man,</b> the thieves <b>came with the intent</b> to steal <b>his</b> property, and he is therefore liable to pay, as he saved himself from financial loss by handing over another’s property. <b>And if</b> he is <b>not</b> wealthy, the thieves presumably <b>came with the intent</b> to steal <b>the silver</b> cup, and he is therefore exempt from liability.
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain man with whom the purse</b> containing funds collected <b>for the redemption of captives was deposited. Thieves came upon him</b> and <b>he took</b> the purse and <b>gave it to them.</b> The case <b>came before Rabba,</b> and Rabba <b>exempted him</b> from payment. <b>Abaye said to him: But this</b> individual <b>is saving himself with another’s property,</b> and he should therefore be liable to pay. Rabba <b>said to him: You have no greater redemption of captives than this.</b> Since the man used the money to avoid being harmed by the thieves, Rabba considered the money to have been used for its intended purpose.
The Gemara relates another incident: There was <b>a certain man who hastened and brought his donkey</b> onboard <b>a ferry [<i>lemavra</i>] before</b> other <b>people boarded the ferry.</b> The donkey began to move around and <b>was about</b> to cause the boat <b>to sink. A certain</b> other <b>man came</b> and <b>pushed the donkey of that</b> first <b>man into the river, and it drowned.</b> The case <b>came before Rabba,</b> and Rabba <b>exempted him</b> from payment. <b>Abaye said to him: But this</b> individual <b>is saving himself with another’s property,</b> and he should therefore be liable to pay. Rabba <b>said to him: This</b> owner of the donkey <b>was</b> considered <b>a pursuer from the outset,</b> as he endangered the other travelers. It is permitted to stop a pursuer by any means necessary, including by destroying his property.
The Gemara notes that <b>Rabba</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rabba says:</b> In the case of <b>a pursuer who was chasing after another</b> in order <b>to kill him and</b> the pursuer <b>broke vessels</b> during the chase, <b>whether</b> they <b>belonged to the pursued</b> party <b>or to anyone</b> else, he is <b>exempt</b> from reimbursing the owner of the vessels. This is <b>because he is liable to</b> receive the <b>death</b> penalty for attempted murder and is consequently exempt from any monetary liability he incurs simultaneously.
<b>And a pursued</b> individual <b>who broke the vessels of the pursuer</b> is also <b>exempt</b> from payment, <b>as the pursuer’s property shall not be cherished more than his body,</b> i.e., his life. Since it is permitted to kill the pursuer in order to save his intended victim, it is permitted to destroy his property for that purpose. <b>But</b> if he destroyed property <b>belonging to anyone</b> else, he is <b>liable</b> to reimburse them, <b>as it is prohibited</b> for him <b>to save himself with another’s property.</b>
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>a pursuer who was chasing after</b> another <b>pursuer</b> in order <b>to save</b> the latter’s intended victim, <b>and</b> he <b>broke vessels</b> during the chase, <b>whether</b> they <b>belonged to the pursued</b> individual, i.e., the individual attempting murder, <b>or to anyone</b> else, he is <b>exempt</b> from payment. The Gemara notes: <b>And this is not</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>by</b> Torah <b>law, but if you do not say so, you</b> will <b>not have</b> any <b>person that saves another from a pursuer.</b> In order to encourage people to attempt to save the lives of others, the Sages instituted that one who damages another’s property in the process of saving a life is exempt from payment.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>a river flooded</b> a misappropriated field, the robber <b>may say to</b> its owner: <b>That which is yours is before you,</b> and no compensation is required. Since the field would have been flooded in any case, the robber has not caused the damage to the field, and is therefore exempt.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the case of <b>one who robbed a field from another and a river</b> then <b>flooded it,</b> the robber is <b>liable to provide</b> the field’s owner with <b>a different field.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar. And the Rabbis say:</b> He is exempt from doing so, as <b>he</b> can <b>say to</b> the owner: <b>That which is yours is before you.</b>
The Gemara analyzes this dispute: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Rabbi Elazar interpreted</b> the verses: “If any one sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit…or anything about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full” (Leviticus 5:21–24), according to the hermeneutical principle of <b>amplifications and restrictions.</b> The phrase: “If any one sin, and commit a trespass against the Lord, <b>and deal falsely with his neighbor,”</b> is <b>an amplification.</b> When the verse states: <b>“In a matter of deposit,”</b> it has <b>restricted</b> the <i>halakha</i> to the case of a deposit. When the verse then states: <b>“Or anything about which he has sworn falsely,</b> he shall restore it in full,” <b>it</b> has <b>then amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> again.
Accordingly, as the Torah <b>amplified and</b> then <b>restricted and</b> then <b>amplified</b> again, it has <b>amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include <b>everything,</b> with only a single exception. <b>And what</b> is included due to the fact that the verse <b>has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The verse <b>has amplified</b> the <i>halakha</i> to include <b>everything</b> that one steals.
<b>And what</b> is excluded due to the fact that the verse <b>restricted</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>It restricted</b> the <i>halakha</i> in order to exclude financial <b>documents,</b> which are dissimilar to a deposit in that their value is not intrinsic, but rather due to their function. Consequently, according to Rabbi Elazar, land that was stolen is included in the <i>halakhot</i> stated in these verses, and one who steals land must reimburse the field’s owner.
<b>And the Rabbis interpreted</b> these verses according to the hermeneutical principle of <b>generalizations and details.</b> The phrase: <b>“And deal falsely</b> with his neighbor,” is <b>a generalization,</b> while the subsequent phrase: <b>“In a matter of deposit,”</b> is <b>a detail.</b> When the verse then states: <b>“Or anything</b> about which he has sworn falsely, he shall restore it in full,” <b>it</b> has <b>then generalized</b> again. In a case of <b>a generalization, and a detail, and a generalization, you may deduce</b> that the verse is referring <b>only</b> to items <b>similar to the detail.</b>
Accordingly, <b>just as the detail,</b> i.e., a deposit, <b>is movable property and</b> has <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value, <b>so too,</b> the verse includes <b>anything that is movable property and</b> has <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value. Consequently, <b>land has been excluded, as it is not movable property. Slaves have been excluded, as they are compared to land</b> with regard to many areas of <i>halakha</i>. Financial <b>documents have been excluded because, although they</b> are <b>movable property, they do not</b> have <b>intrinsic monetary</b> value.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> there is <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who robbed</b> another of <b>a cow and a river washed it away,</b> the robber is <b>liable to provide</b> the owner with another <b>cow;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Elazar. And the Rabbis say:</b> The robber can <b>say to</b> the owner: <b>That which is yours is before you,</b> and he would consequently be exempt. The Gemara asks: <b>There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>with regard to what do they disagree?</b> The rationale offered previously cannot apply, as a cow is movable property and has intrinsic value, and yet Rabbi Elazar and the Rabbis still disagree.
<b>Rav Pappa said: There, with what are we dealing?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where he</b> had <b>robbed another of a field, and there was</b>

Daf 118a

<b>a prone cow in it, and a river washed it</b> away. <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning,</b> as he maintains that land is included in the category of items that are not subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of robbery. Consequently, the robber acquires the land and simultaneously becomes liable to return it. Since he acquires the land, he acquires the cow that is on the land as well, and is liable to compensate its owner when it gets washed away by the river. <b>And the Rabbis</b> conform <b>to their</b> standard line of <b>reasoning,</b> as they hold that land was excluded by the verse. Therefore, the robber does not acquire the land and also does not acquire the cow.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who robs another or</b> who <b>borrowed</b> money <b>from him, or</b> one <b>with whom</b> another had <b>deposited</b> an item, if any of these interactions took place <b>in a settled area, he may not return</b> the item <b>to him in an unsettled area,</b> where it is of little benefit to the owner and he cannot safeguard it. If the loan or deposit was given <b>on the condition</b> that the recipient <b>may go out</b> and return it to the owner <b>in an unsettled area, he may return</b> it <b>to him in an unsettled area.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to the mishna from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A loan may be repaid in any location,</b> while <b>a lost item and a deposit are returned only in their location,</b> i.e., the same type of place, settled or unsettled, where they were found or received. <b>Abaye said: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: A loan may be claimed</b> by the creditor <b>in any location.</b> Yet, if the borrower initiates the process of repaying the loan in an unsettled area, the creditor may refuse to accept the repayment until they reach a settled area. Conversely, <b>a lost item and a deposit may be claimed only in their location.</b>
The mishna teaches that if the loan or deposit was given <b>on the condition</b> that the recipient <b>may go out</b> and return it to the owner <b>in an unsettled area,</b> he may do so. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that an explicit stipulation to this effect is binding? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary, as</b> the mishna is discussing a case <b>where</b> the depositor <b>said to</b> the bailee: <b>Let this deposit be with you, as I am going out to an unsettled area, and</b> the bailee <b>said to him: I also need to go out to an unsettled area,</b> so <b>if I need to return</b> the deposit <b>to you there,</b> I will <b>return it to you</b> there.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who says to another: I robbed you,</b> or: <b>You lent me</b> money, or: <b>You deposited</b> an item <b>with me, and I do not know if I returned</b> your property <b>to you</b> or <b>if I did not return</b> it <b>to you,</b> he is <b>liable to pay</b> the sum or item in question. <b>But if he said to him: I do not know if I robbed you,</b> or: I do not know <b>if you lent me money,</b> or: I do not know <b>if you deposited</b> an item <b>with me,</b> he is <b>exempt from paying</b> the sum or item in question.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara cites a related dispute: It <b>was stated</b> that if one individual says to another: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession, and the other says: I do not know</b> whether or not this is true, <b>Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda say</b> that he is <b>liable</b> to pay the plaintiff, <b>and Rav Naḥman and Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that he is <b>exempt</b> from paying.
The Gemara explains the reason for each opinion: <b>Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda say</b> that he is <b>liable</b> to pay, because when there is <b>a certain</b> claim <b>and an uncertain</b> claim, <b>the certain</b> claim is <b>superior. Rav Naḥman and Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> that he is <b>exempt</b> from paying because of the principle: <b>Establish the money in the possession of its owner,</b> i.e., money is not taken from one’s possession without clear proof that he is liable to pay it.
The Gemara attempts to derive a proof: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: <b>But if he said to him: I do not know if you lent me money,</b> he is <b>exempt</b> from paying. <b>What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that the mishna is discussing a case where the lender <b>did not claim</b> the money from <b>him, the first clause</b> must <b>also</b> discuss a situation where the lender <b>did not claim</b> the money from him. If so, <b>why is</b> the borrower <b>liable</b> to pay in the case discussed in the first clause? <b>Rather,</b> the mishna must be discussing a case where the lender <b>did claim</b> the money from <b>him, and the latter clause</b> nevertheless <b>teaches</b> that the borrower is <b>exempt from paying,</b> even though his claim is uncertain and that of the lender is certain. This supports the opinion of Rav Naḥman and Rabbi Yoḥanan.
The Gemara answers: <b>No, actually</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the lender <b>did not claim</b> the money from <b>him, and the first clause</b> is discussing a case <b>where</b> the borrower <b>comes to fulfill</b> his obligation <b>to Heaven.</b>
The Gemara adds that it <b>was also stated: Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of <b>one who says to another: I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession, and the other</b> individual <b>says: I do not know</b> whether or not this is true, the latter is <b>liable</b> to pay. This applies <b>where he comes to fulfill</b> his obligation <b>to Heaven</b> even though he cannot be forced to pay. This statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who stole a lamb from a flock and returned it</b> without informing the owner that he had done so, <b>and</b> then <b>it died or was stolen,</b> the thief is <b>liable</b> to pay <b>restitution</b> for <b>it.</b> If <b>the</b> lamb’s <b>owners did not know</b> about the entire incident, i.e., they did <b>not</b> know <b>that it was stolen and</b> they did <b>not</b> know <b>that it was returned, and they counted the</b> flock of <b>sheep and</b> found <b>it whole,</b> the thief is <b>exempt</b> from paying.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara presents several ways to understand the mishna: <b>Rav says:</b> In a case where the owners <b>had knowledge</b> of the fact that their lamb was stolen, the thief is <b>required</b> to return it with the <b>knowledge</b> of the owners in order to be exempt from liability if the lamb is subsequently harmed. In a case where the owners <b>had no knowledge</b> that the lamb was taken, their <b>count</b> of the flock after the thief returned it <b>exempts</b> the thief from further liability. <b>And when</b> the mishna <b>teaches: And they counted the</b> flock of <b>sheep and</b> found <b>it whole,</b> it is referring specifically <b>to the latter clause,</b> i.e., the case where the owners were unaware that the lamb was stolen, as it is specifically in that case that the count exempts the thief from liability.
<b>And Shmuel says: Whether</b> the owners <b>had knowledge</b> of the theft <b>or whether</b> they did <b>not have knowledge</b> of it, their <b>count</b> of the flock <b>exempts</b> the thief from payment. <b>And when</b> the mishna <b>teaches: And they counted</b> the flock of sheep <b>and</b> found <b>it whole,</b> the thief is <b>exempt,</b> it is referring <b>to the entire</b> mishna, as this exempts the thief from liability in both cases mentioned in the mishna.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In a case where the owners <b>had knowledge</b> of the theft, their <b>count</b> of the flock <b>exempts</b> the thief, and in a case where the owners <b>had no knowledge</b> of the theft, <b>even counting is not required</b> for the thief to be exempt. <b>And when</b> the mishna <b>teaches: And they counted the</b> flock of <b>sheep and</b> found <b>it whole,</b> it is referring specifically <b>to the first clause</b> of the mishna, as it is particularly in that case that the count is relevant.
<b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> In a case where the owners <b>had knowledge</b> of the theft, their <b>count</b> of the flock <b>exempts</b> the thief. In a case where the owners <b>had no knowledge</b> of the theft, the thief is <b>required</b> to return the lamb with their <b>knowledge</b> in order to become exempt from liability for future damage. <b>And when</b> the mishna <b>teaches: And they counted the</b> flock of <b>sheep and</b> found <b>it whole,</b> it is referring specifically <b>to the first clause</b> of the mishna, where the owners were aware of the theft, as it is only in that case that counting the flock is sufficient to exempt the thief from further liability.
<b>Rava says:</b>

Daf 118b

<b>What is the reasoning of Rav Ḥisda,</b> who holds that the requirement to return the animal with the owner’s knowledge is in the case where the owners did not know about the theft? <b>Since</b> the thief <b>taught</b> the lamb to take <b>steps outside,</b> i.e., to leave the owners’ property, it will now require greater supervision, which the owners can provide only if they are aware of the situation.
The Gemara assumes that since Rava explained Rav Ḥisda’s reasoning, he accepts Rav Ḥisda’s ruling. The Gemara asks: <b>But did Rava</b> actually <b>say this? Doesn’t Rava say</b> that in the case of <b>this person who saw another lift a lamb from his flock</b> in order to steal it, <b>and</b> the owner then <b>raised</b> his <b>voice at</b> the thief, <b>and</b> the thief <b>discarded it, but</b> the owner <b>did not know if</b> the thief <b>returned</b> the lamb or <b>if he did not return it, and</b> the lamb then <b>died or was stolen,</b> the thief is to pay <b>restitution</b> for <b>it?</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>What,</b> is this statement of Rava <b>not</b> applicable <b>even if</b> the owner <b>counted</b> his flock after this incident? Accordingly, Rava rules that if the owner knew about the theft, the thief is rendered exempt from liability only if he returns the lamb with the owner’s knowledge, which is not in accordance with the ruling of Rav Ḥisda. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> Rava’s ruling applies only <b>where</b> the owner <b>did not count</b> the flock.
The Gemara examines Rav’s ruling. <b>But did Rav</b> actually <b>say this? Doesn’t Rav say</b> that if the thief <b>returned</b> the lamb <b>to the</b> owner’s <b>flock that is in an unsettled area,</b> he has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation to return it? This indicates that the thief is exempt from further liability even though the thief did not inform the owner of the lamb’s return and the owner did not count the flock. The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Abba said: Rav concedes</b> that the thief is exempt in this case only <b>where</b> the lamb was <b>spotted [<i>birkuata</i>].</b> Since the lamb’s spots are distinctive, the owner immediately becomes aware of its return.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that the amoraic dispute cited previously is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who steals a lamb from a flock or a <i>sela</i> from a purse</b> must <b>return</b> it <b>to the place</b> from where <b>he stole</b> it; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael. Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The thief is <b>required</b> to return it with the <b>knowledge of</b> its <b>owners.</b>
The Gemara explains: The Sages discussing the matter <b>assumed that everyone accepts</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says: A person is prone to feel his purse constantly,</b> and therefore becomes aware of the theft soon after it takes place. <b>What, is it not</b> a case <b>where a <i>sela</i></b> was stolen with the owner’s <b>knowledge, and</b> the dispute of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva is parallel <b>to the dispute of Rav and Shmuel?</b> According to this explanation, Rav rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, and Shmuel rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael.
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> they disagree <b>in</b> the case of <b>a lamb that</b> was stolen <b>without the knowledge</b> of its owners, i.e., they did not know that it was stolen, <b>and</b> the dispute of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva is parallel <b>to the dispute of Rav Ḥisda and Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b> Rav Ḥisda rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva that the lamb must be returned with the owner’s knowledge, and Rabbi Yoḥanan rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yishmael that the owners do not need to become aware of the lamb’s return.
<b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava: With regard to a bailee who stole</b> a lamb <b>from the owner’s domain, everyone,</b> including Rabbi Yishmael, <b>agrees</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b> and the owner must be aware of the animal’s return in order for the thief to become exempt from further liability. <b>And here it is with regard to</b> whether <b>a bailee who stole from</b> within <b>his</b> own <b>domain may return</b> what he stole <b>to the place from</b> where <b>he stole</b> it that <b>they disagree. Rabbi Akiva holds: His safeguarding was terminated</b> when he stole the lamb and he must therefore return it with the owner’s knowledge. <b>And Rabbi Yishmael holds: His safeguarding was not terminated</b> and he may return it to his own domain.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let</b> us <b>say</b> that with regard to the dispute over whether the owner’s <b>counting</b> of his flock <b>exempts</b> a thief who returned a stolen lamb without notifying the owner, it <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who robbed another and</b> then <b>included</b> the money he owed <b>him</b> for the robbery <b>in the calculation</b> of the payment for a different transaction, i.e., he compensated the owner by overpaying him for a different transaction, <b>it is taught</b> in <b>one</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>He</b> has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation to pay, <b>and it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>He</b> has <b>not fulfilled</b> his obligation to pay.
The Sages discussing the matter <b>assumed that everyone accepts</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says: A person is prone to feel his purse constantly,</b> and therefore becomes aware that he has been compensated soon after the payment is made. <b>What, is it not with regard to this</b> following point that <b>they disagree: The one who says</b> that the robber has <b>fulfilled</b> his obligation <b>holds</b> that the <b>counting</b> of the property <b>exempts</b> a robber from further liability, <b>and the one who says</b> that the robber has <b>not fulfilled</b> his obligation <b>holds</b> that the <b>counting does not exempt</b> a robber from further liability.
The Gemara responds: One can <b>say</b> that <b>if we held in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak,</b> it would follow that <b>everyone agrees that</b> the <b>counting</b> of the property <b>exempts</b> a robber from further liability. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> itself that <b>they disagree:</b> One <b>Sage accepts</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak, and</b> one <b>Sage does not accept</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>everyone accepts</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak, and</b> it <b>is not difficult: This</b> first <i>baraita</i>, which rules that the robber fulfilled his obligation, is discussing a case <b>where</b> the robber <b>counted</b> the money <b>and placed it</b> directly <b>in</b> the owner’s <b>purse,</b> which the owner will soon open and count. <b>And that</b> other <i>baraita</i>, which rules that the robber did not fulfill his obligation, is discussing a case <b>where he counted</b> the money <b>and placed it in</b> the owner’s <b>hand.</b> Consequently, it is possible that the owner will put the money directly into a container with other coins in it and will never realize that he was compensated for the theft.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that both <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are discussing a case <b>where</b> the robber <b>counted</b> the money <b>and placed it in</b> the owner’s <b>purse. This</b> <i>baraita</i> discusses a case <b>where he has other dinars in his purse,</b> but he did not know how many. Therefore, when he counts the money, he will not realize that the robber inserted an additional sum. Whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>where he does not have other dinars in his purse,</b> so that when he counts the money he will realize that an additional sum has been included in the payment.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One may not purchase wool, milk, and kids from the shepherds</b> who tend the flocks of others, due to the concern that they have stolen these items from the owners of the flocks. <b>And</b> similarly, one may <b>not</b> purchase <b>wood and produce from produce watchmen.</b>
<b>But one may purchase from women woolen goods in Judea, and linen goods in the Galilee, and calves in the Sharon,</b> as women in these locations often work with those commodities and it can be assumed that they are selling the items with the owner’s consent. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all these</b> items, in a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>told</b> the buyer <b>to conceal</b> the purchase, <b>it is prohibited,</b> as there is good reason to suspect that the items are stolen. <b>And one may purchase eggs and chickens from everywhere,</b> as it is unlikely that one would steal and sell these commodities.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:9): <b>One may purchase from shepherds neither goats, nor kids, nor fleeces, nor torn</b> pieces <b>of wool, but one may purchase sewn</b> garments <b>from them, because they are</b> presumed to be <b>theirs. And one may purchase milk and cheese from them in an unsettled area, but not in a settled area.</b>
<b>And one may purchase from them four or five sheep</b> or <b>four or five fleeces</b> at a time, because it is unlikely that a shepherd would risk stealing such a significant quantity at once. <b>But</b> one may <b>not</b> purchase <b>two sheep, and</b> similarly, one may <b>not</b> purchase <b>two fleeces</b> at a time, as it is reasonable to assume that the shepherd would attempt to steal this amount from the owner.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may purchase domesticated</b> animals <b>from them,</b> as it is unlikely that the shepherds would steal them from their owner, who would notice if they did not return home. Conversely, <b>one may not purchase desert,</b> i.e., non-domesticated, animals <b>from them,</b> as it is more likely that a shepherd would steal these animals. <b>The principle of the matter</b> is that with regard to <b>anything that the shepherd sells and the owner</b> would <b>perceive its</b> absence if it were stolen, <b>one may purchase</b> it <b>from them.</b> But if the owner <b>would not perceive its</b> absence, one <b>may not purchase</b> it <b>from them.</b>
The Gemara examines the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> that <b>one may purchase from them four or five sheep</b> or <b>four or five fleeces</b> at a time. <b>Now</b> that <b>it can be said</b> that <b>we</b> may <b>buy four</b> sheep, as it is unlikely that the shepherd would steal such a large quantity at one time, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to state that we may buy <b>five?</b> The Gemara answers that <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The meaning of the <i>baraita</i> is that one may purchase <b>four</b> sheep <b>out of</b> a flock consisting of <b>five</b> sheep, as it is reasonable to assume that the shepherd would not attempt to steal four-fifths of the owner’s flock. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda said</b> as follows: <b>Four</b> sheep may be purchased <b>from</b> the shepherd of <b>a small flock, and five</b> may be purchased <b>from</b> the shepherd of <b>a large flock.</b>
The Gemara asks another question with regard to the <i>baraita</i>: <b>This matter itself is difficult,</b> as <b>you said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: One may purchase <b>from them four or five sheep</b> or <b>four or five fleeces</b> at a time, which indicates that purchasing <b>four or five, yes,</b> it is permitted, <b>but</b> purchasing <b>three, no,</b> it is prohibited. <b>Say the latter clause: But</b> one may <b>not</b> purchase <b>two sheep.</b> This indicates <b>that we may purchase three</b> sheep at a time.
The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult: This</b> clause, which permits the purchase of three sheep, is discussing a case <b>where</b> the sheep are <b>robust,</b> and therefore the owner is more attentive to them and would notice if three were missing. Conversely, <b>that</b> clause, which prohibits the purchase of three sheep, is discussing a case <b>where</b> the sheep are <b>frail.</b> Consequently, the owner does not care about them as much, and it is possible that he would not notice if only three of them went missing.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may purchase domesticated</b> animals <b>from them,</b> but <b>one may not purchase desert</b> animals <b>from them. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda referring to the first clause, and</b> his statement is therefore <b>a stringency? Or perhaps</b> it <b>is referring to the latter clause, and</b> his statement is <b>a leniency?</b>
The Gemara elaborates: Is it <b>referring to the first clause, and</b> his statement is therefore <b>a stringency, as he</b> would be <b>saying: One may purchase four or five sheep from them,</b> and <b>this statement applies</b> only to <b>domesticated</b> animals, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>desert</b> animals, <b>even four or five sheep</b> may <b>not</b> be purchased? <b>Or perhaps</b> it <b>is referring to the latter clause and</b> it is <b>a leniency, as he</b> would be <b>saying: But</b> one may <b>not</b> purchase <b>two sheep, and</b> similarly, one may <b>not</b> purchase <b>two fleeces,</b> and <b>this statement applies</b> only to <b>desert</b> animals, <b>but</b> with regard to <b>domesticated</b> animals, <b>one may purchase even two</b> animals.
The Gemara presents an answer: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to the dilemma, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One may purchase domesticated</b> animals <b>from them, but one may not purchase desert</b> animals <b>from them. But one may always purchase four or five sheep from them.</b>

Daf 119a

<b>From</b> the fact <b>that he stated</b> that four or five animals may <b>always</b> be purchased, <b>conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Yehuda’s statement <b>is referring to the latter clause, and</b> his statement is a <b>leniency.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that Rabbi Yehuda intended his statement as a leniency.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> similarly, one may <b>not</b> purchase wood and produce <b>from produce watchmen.</b> The Gemara relates that <b>Rav purchased grapevine branches from a sharecropper. Abaye said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>And</b> similarly, one may <b>not</b> purchase <b>wood and produce from produce watchmen?</b> The same <i>halakha</i> should apply with regard to a sharecropper, who, like a watchman, is not the owner of the produce. Rav <b>said to him: This statement applies</b> only <b>with regard to a watchman, as he has no</b> share <b>at all in the land itself. But</b> with regard to <b>a sharecropper, who does have</b> a share <b>in it, say: He is selling</b> merchandise <b>from his own</b> share of the land. Since it is plausible that the sharecropper is selling his own property, it is permitted to buy it from him.
The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> which discusses purchasing items from watchmen: <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:8): With regard to <b>produce watchmen, one may purchase</b> produce <b>from them when they are sitting and selling</b> the produce, <b>and the baskets are before them and the scales [<i>veturtanei</i>] are before them,</b> as in these circumstances it is reasonable to assume that they are not selling stolen merchandise. <b>But</b> in <b>all</b> cases <b>where they said</b> to the buyer: <b>Conceal</b> your purchase, it is <b>prohibited</b> to purchase from them, as there is good reason to suspect that the merchandise is stolen. The <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>One may purchase from</b> a watchman <b>from the entrance of the garden, but not from the back of the garden,</b> because if the produce is being sold inconspicuously, there is a concern that it might have been stolen.
§ Having discussed the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to suspected theft, the Gemara proceeds to examine the <i>halakha</i> pertaining to purchasing items from a known robber. <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>a robber, from when is it permitted to purchase</b> items <b>from him? Rav says:</b> It is prohibited <b>until the majority</b> of his possessions are <b>from his</b> own property, i.e., property that he obtained legally. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> It is permitted to purchase items from a known robber <b>even</b> if only <b>a minority</b> of his possessions are from <b>his</b> own property.
The Gemara notes that <b>Rav Yehuda instructed Adda,</b> his <b>attendant, in accordance with the statement of the one who says:</b> It is permitted to purchase items from a known robber <b>even</b> if only <b>a minority</b> of his possessions are from <b>his</b> own property, i.e., in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel.
With regard to the <b>property</b> of <b>an informer,</b> i.e., one who informs gentiles of the whereabouts of another’s property, facilitating its theft or misuse, there is a dispute between <b>Rav Huna and Rav Yehuda. One says:</b> It is <b>permitted to physically destroy it, and one says:</b> It is <b>prohibited to physically destroy it.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: The rationale of <b>the one who says</b> that it is <b>permitted to physically destroy it</b> is that an informer’s <b>property should not be</b> subject to a more <b>stringent</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>than his body.</b> Since it is permitted to physically harm or even kill an informer, it would be unreasonable to prohibit the destruction of his property. <b>And</b> the rationale of <b>the one who says</b> that it is <b>prohibited to</b> physically <b>destroy it</b> is that <b>perhaps he will have good children, and it is written: The wicked may prepare it, but the just shall put it on</b> (see Job 27:17).
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Ḥisda had a certain sharecropper who would weigh</b> the field’s produce <b>and give</b> Rav Ḥisda his portion, and <b>weigh</b> the produce <b>and take</b> his own portion. Rav Ḥisda <b>dismissed him,</b> and <b>read</b> the following verse <b>about him:</b> “A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s chil-dren; <b>and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous”</b> (Proverbs 13:22).
§ The Gemara examines various verses pertaining to robbers. <b>“For what is the hope of the godless, though he profits, when God takes away his soul?”</b> (Job 27:8). This verse is the subject of a dispute between <b>Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda. One says</b> that the phrase “God takes away his soul” is referring to <b>the soul of the robbed, and one says</b> that it is referring to the <b>soul of the robber.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: The rationale of <b>the one who says</b> that the verse is referring to <b>the soul of the robbed</b> is <b>as it is written: “So are the ways of every one that is greedy for profit; it takes away the life of the owner thereof”</b> (Proverbs 1:19), which teaches that one who robs another of his property is considered as one who robbed him of his soul. And the rationale of <b>the one who says</b> that it is referring to <b>the soul of the robber</b> is <b>as it is written: “Rob not the weak, because he is weak, neither crush the poor in the gate; for the Lord will plead their cause, and despoil of life those that despoil them”</b> (Proverbs 22:22–23).
The Gemara questions each opinion: <b>And</b> according to <b>the other</b> opinion, i.e., the latter one, <b>isn’t it also written: “It takes away the life of the owner thereof,”</b> which indicates that the soul of the robbed is taken? The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“the owner thereof”?</b> It is referring to <b>its current owner,</b> i.e., the robber, who has acquired the stolen item.
<b>And</b> according to <b>the other</b> opinion, who said that the life of the robbed is taken, <b>isn’t it also written: “And despoil of life those that despoil them,”</b> which indicates that the soul of the robber is taken? The Gemara answers that the verse <b>is saying: What is the reason.</b> The verse teaches: <b>What is the reason</b> that God <b>will despoil</b> the life of <b>those who despoil them?</b> It is <b>because they despoiled the soul</b> of their victims.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who robs another</b> of an item <b>worth one <i>peruta</i></b> is considered <b>as though he takes his soul from him, as it is stated: “So are the ways of every one that is greedy for profit; it takes away the life of the owner thereof”</b> (Proverbs 1:19). <b>And it states: “And they shall consume your harvest, and your bread,</b> they shall consume <b>your sons and your daughters”</b> (Jeremiah 5:17). Since they will consume the harvest and bread, it is as though they consume one’s children as well because there will be no food to feed them.
<b>And it states:</b> “Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, <b>for the extortion of the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land”</b> (Joel 4:19). The verse here considers extortion like the shedding of innocent blood. <b>And it states</b> with regard to a famine: “And the Lord said: <b>It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites”</b> (II Samuel 21:1).
The Gemara asks: Since Rabbi Yoḥanan’s point was proven by the first verse, <b>what</b> was the purpose of adding each subsequent verse by saying: <b>And it states?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>And if you would say</b> that the robber takes only <b>his,</b> i.e., the victim’s, <b>life, but the lives of his sons and daughters</b> are <b>not</b> taken, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> the second verse, which mentions <b>the flesh of his sons and daughters.</b>
<b>And if you would say: This matter applies</b> only <b>where</b> the robber <b>does not give</b> his victim <b>compensation</b> for the stolen item, <b>but where he gave compensation</b> for the stolen item, it is <b>not</b> comparable to murder, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> the verse: <b>“For the extortion of the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.”</b> Extortion is referring to coercing someone to sell an item that he does not want to sell. It is a form of robbery, and the verse equates it with murder.
<b>And if you would say: This matter applies</b> only <b>where he committed</b> the robbery <b>by</b> direct <b>action, but</b> if he committed it through <b>indirect</b> action, the transgression is <b>not</b> as severe, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> the verse: <b>“It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites.” And where did we</b> ever <b>find that Saul killed the Gibeonites?</b> He did not do so. <b>Rather, due to</b> the fact that <b>he killed</b> the residents of <b>Nob, the city of the priests, who would provide</b> the Gibeonites with <b>water</b> (see I Samuel, chapter 22) <b>and food, the verse ascribes him</b> blame for their death <b>as though he</b> had <b>killed</b> the Gibeonites himself.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But one may purchase</b> specific goods <b>from women</b> in certain places. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:5): <b>One may purchase from women woolen goods in Judea, and linen goods in the Galilee, but not wines, oils, and flours,</b> as these are not usually sold by women and there is a concern that perhaps the women stole them from their husbands. <b>And no</b> items may be purchased <b>from slaves, or from children. Abba Shaul says: A woman may sell</b> items <b>for</b> up to <b>four and five dinars in order to make a cap [<i>kippa</i>] for her head,</b> as it is assumed that her husband allows her to sell these items in order to purchase additional articles of clothing. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>all</b> of <b>those</b> cases, <b>where they told</b> the buyer <b>to conceal</b> his purchase, it is <b>prohibited</b> to enter into the transaction.
<b>Charity collectors may take something</b> worth <b>a small</b> amount <b>from</b> women, <b>but not something</b> worth <b>a large</b> amount, as it is possible that they do not have permission to give away expensive items.
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>olive pressers,</b> one <b>may purchase from them olives in</b> a substantial <b>measure, and oil in</b> a substantial <b>measure,</b> as there is no concern that they would steal such a large amount, <b>but not olives in a small</b> amount, <b>and</b> not <b>oil in a small</b> amount. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: One may purchase olives in small</b> amounts <b>from women in the Upper Galilee,</b> where olives are exceptionally expensive, <b>as at times, a person is embarrassed to sell</b> olives <b>at the entrance of his house, and</b> so <b>he gives</b> some olives <b>to his wife, and she sells</b> them. Since there is a reason to presume that the women have been given the right to sell the olives by their husbands, and it is unlikely that the women would sell them without permission, as even a small amount missing would be noticed due to their great value, it may be assumed that the olives are being sold with permission.
The Gemara relates: When <b>Ravina arrived at Bei Meḥoza, the women of Bei Meḥoza came and tossed chains and bracelets before him</b> so that he could distribute the jewelry as charity, and <b>he accepted</b> it <b>from them. Rabba Tosfa’a said to Ravina: But isn’t it taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Charity collectors may accept something</b> worth <b>a small</b> amount <b>from</b> women, <b>but not something</b> worth <b>a large</b> amount? How can you accept jewelry, which is worth a significant sum? Ravina <b>said to him: For the residents of Meḥoza, these</b> chains and bracelets <b>are</b> considered <b>something small,</b> and it is therefore permitted for me to accept them.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Strands</b> of wool <b>that the launderer removes</b> from the garment <b>belong to him,</b> as it can be assumed that the customer is uninterested in them, <b>but</b> strands that <b>the carder,</b> i.e., one who prepares wool for use as a textile, <b>removes belong to the customer,</b> as it is assumed that the customer would want them, since the carder often removes a significant number of strands. <b>A launderer takes three threads</b> that were inserted at the edge of a garment, <b>and they are his,</b> but with regard to <b>more</b> threads <b>than this, these</b> additional threads <b>belong to the customer. If</b> these <b>were black</b> threads <b>on a white</b> garment, <b>he takes all of them and they are his.</b> As the removal of the threads improves the appearance of the garment, the customer does not want them.
In the case of <b>a tailor who left</b> enough <b>thread</b> attached to the cloth that it could be used <b>in order to sew with it, or</b> if there was <b>a patch</b> of cloth <b>that is three</b> fingerbreadths <b>by three</b> fingerbreadths left from the cloth given to the tailor by the customer, <b>these</b> items <b>belong to the customer. That which a carpenter removes with an adze belongs to him,</b> because an adze removes only small shavings of wood, which the customer is uninterested in; <b>but</b> what he removes <b>with an ax [<i>uvakashil</i>] belongs to the customer. And if he was doing</b> his work <b>in</b> the domain of <b>the customer,</b> then <b>even the sawdust belongs to the customer.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:13): <b>One may purchase strands</b> of wool <b>from a launderer, because they are</b> assumed to be <b>his. A launderer may take the two upper threads</b> of a garment, <b>and they are his.</b>

Daf 119b

<b>And</b> a carder <b>should not place in</b> a piece of cloth <b>more than three stitches</b> for each loop that he attaches to the cloth in order to stretch it out, as this causes the cloth to overstretch and require trimming. <b>And he should not card the cloth</b> along <b>its warp,</b> i.e., vertically, <b>but</b> along <b>its weft,</b> i.e., horizontally. <b>And he may even out</b> the cloth by cutting it along <b>its length, but not</b> along <b>its width, and if he comes to even out</b> the cloth by removing <b>up to a handbreadth</b> of material, it is <b>permitted</b> for him to do so.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that the launderer may take <b>two threads. But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that the launderer may take <b>three</b> threads? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult:</b> The ruling of <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which allows only two threads, is stated <b>with regard to thick</b> threads, <b>and</b> the ruling of <b>that</b> mishna, which allows three threads, is stated <b>with regard to thin</b> ones.
It was also stated in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And he should not card the cloth</b> along <b>its warp but</b> along <b>its weft.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that <b>the opposite</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult:</b> The ruling of <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which prohibits carding along the warp, is stated <b>with regard to</b> an ordinary <b>garment,</b> which is designed for durability, and one should therefore avoid wearing out the material by carding along the warp. The ruling of <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which allows one to card along the warp, is stated <b>with regard to</b> an elegant <b>cape [<i>besarbela</i>],</b> which is made for aesthetic appearance and is therefore improved by carding in this manner.
The Gemara examines the next clause of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> a carder <b>should not place in</b> a cloth <b>more than three stiches</b> for each loop. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma</b> with regard to the definition of the term stitch in this context: Does drawing the needle <b>in and out</b> constitute <b>one</b> stitch, <b>or perhaps</b> does drawing the needle <b>in and out</b> constitute <b>two</b> stitches? The Gemara responds: The question <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
It was further stated in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And he may even out</b> the cloth by cutting it along <b>its length, but not</b> along <b>its width.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that <b>the opposite</b> is true? The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult:</b> The statement of <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i>, which rules that one should even out the cloth along its length, is stated <b>with regard to a garment,</b> where an uneven length would be conspicuous. The statement of <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which rules that one should even it out along its width, is stated <b>with regard to a belt,</b> as the width of a belt is more noticeable than its length while it is being worn.
§ The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that discusses which items may be purchased from a carder. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:12): <b>One may not purchase strands</b> of thread <b>from a carder, because</b> it is assumed that <b>they are not his. And in a place where</b> the residents <b>were accustomed</b> to allow carders to retain strands, the strands may be presumed <b>to be his</b> and <b>one may purchase</b> them. <b>And in every place, one may purchase from them a cushion full of</b> stuffing made from <b>strands, or a mattress full of</b> stuffing made from <b>strands. What is the reason</b> that it is permitted? The reason is that even if the carder had stolen the strands, once he uses them to make a cushion or mattress, <b>he has acquired</b> them <b>through a change</b> of form.
§ Apropos the <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to weaving, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that discusses which items may be purchased from various craftsmen. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:11): <b>One may purchase from a weaver neither</b> woolen <b>wads [<i>irin</i>],</b> which are used to hold the bobbin in place on a shuttle, <b>nor heddles [<i>nirin</i>], nor threads of the bobbin [<i>punkalin</i>], nor remnants of</b> coils of thread that were left on the <b>spool,</b> as there is a concern that these items were taken from the customer without his consent.
<b>But one may purchase a spotted garment from them,</b> even though the design indicates that it was made from strands of different colors, which the weaver may have stolen from other garments that he was weaving. It is also permitted to purchase <b>warp</b> threads <b>and weft</b> threads from them, as well as wool that was <b>spun</b> into thread <b>or woven.</b> All of these items may be purchased from the weaver because they have undergone a physical change, and have therefore been acquired by the weaver even if he did steal them.
The Gemara asks: <b>Say: Now</b> that the <i>baraita</i> taught that one <b>may purchase spun</b> wool despite the fact that it has undergone only a minor physical change, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that one may purchase <b>woven</b> wool, which has undergone a greater change of form? The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it mentions <b>woven</b> wool? It is not referring to wool woven into a garment, but to wool that was twisted into <b>chains,</b> which is also a minor physical change.
The Gemara examines which items may be bought from a dyer. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may purchase from a dyer neither</b> pieces of wool used for <b>tests, nor</b> pieces used as a color <b>sample [<i>dugmut</i>], nor detached</b> pieces <b>of wool,</b> as these might have been stolen. <b>But one may purchase from him a colored garment, spun</b> threads, and <b>clothes</b> fashioned from the aforementioned pieces of material. The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that the <i>baraita</i> taught that one <b>may purchase spun</b> threads from the dyer, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that one may purchase <b>clothes?</b> It is obvious that one may purchase clothes, as the clothes themselves are made of spun threads. The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it mentions <b>clothes?</b> It is referring to <b>felt</b> garments, which are not made of spun thread.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:16): In the case of <b>one who gives hides to a tanner, the trimmings</b> of hide <b>and the detached</b> hairs <b>belong to the customer, but</b> the substance that <b>comes up</b> while being <b>washed in water belongs to him,</b> the tanner.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>if</b> the threads <b>were black</b> on a white garment, the launderer may take all of them. <b>Rav Yehuda said:</b> A launderer <b>is called a <i>katzra</i></b> in Aramaic, <b>and he takes the short [<i>katzra</i>]</b> shreds of wool <b>for himself. Rav Yehuda</b> also <b>said: All</b> the threads, even those usually removed from the garment, <b>are counted toward the</b> minimum <b>number of</b> thumb-lengths between the hole through which the <b>sky-blue wool</b> is inserted for ritual fringes and the edge of the garment. <b>But Yitzḥak, my son, is particular about these</b> threads, and makes sure that the garment is of the proper measurement even if the threads were to be removed.
The mishna teaches: In the case of <b>a tailor who left</b> enough <b>thread</b> attached to the cloth in order to sew with it, this thread belongs to the customer. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> thread is necessary in order to be able <b>to sew? Rav Asi said: The length of a needle outside the needle. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Did Rav Asi mean that the thread must be <b>the size of</b> the <b>needle and</b> that <b>beyond the needle</b> there must be an additional amount of thread <b>equivalent to the size of</b> the <b>needle? Or perhaps</b> he meant that it must be <b>the size of</b> the <b>needle, and</b> that <b>beyond the needle</b> there must be <b>any</b> minimal <b>amount</b> of additional string. In other words, was Rav Asi saying that the thread must be two needle lengths, or slightly more than one needle length?
The Gemara responds: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a tailor who left the thread</b> attached to the cloth, but it was <b>less than</b> the length necessary <b>in order to sew with it, or</b> if there was <b>a patch</b> of cloth <b>that is less than three</b> fingerbreadths <b>by three</b> fingerbreadths left from the cloth given to the tailor by the customer, the <i>halakha</i> is dependent upon the customer’s inclination: <b>When the customer is particular about</b> such items, <b>these</b> items <b>belong to the customer,</b> but if <b>the customer is not particular about them, these</b> items <b>belong to</b> the tailor.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i> to deduce the answer: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that Rav Asi meant to say that the thread must be <b>the size of</b> the <b>needle and</b> that <b>beyond the needle</b> there must be an additional amount of thread <b>equivalent to the size of</b> the <b>needle,</b> then the ruling in the <i>baraita</i> that a slightly shorter thread belongs to the customer if he wishes to keep it is reasonable, since a thread which is <b>less than that</b> length <b>is</b> still <b>fit for</b> use as the stitching of <b>a loop. But if you say</b> that Rav Asi meant that the thread must be <b>the size of</b> the <b>needle and</b> that <b>beyond the needle</b> there must be <b>any amount</b> of additional string, then with regard to a thread that is even <b>less than that,</b> for what use <b>is</b> it <b>fit</b> that the customer might wish to keep it?
<b>Rather, learn from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that Rav Asi meant that the thread must be <b>the size of</b> the <b>needle and</b> that <b>beyond the needle</b> there must be an additional amount of thread <b>equivalent to the size of</b> the <b>needle,</b> so that the thread must be a total of two needle lengths. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that this is so.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>That which the carpenter</b> removes with an adze belongs to him, but what he removes with an ax belongs to the customer. The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> to this ruling based upon a <i>baraita</i>: <b>That which the carpenter removes with an adze and that which is severed with a saw belong to the customer. But</b> with regard to <b>that which comes out from under a drill or under a plane [<i>rehitni</i>], and that which is scraped by the saw,</b> i.e., sawdust, <b>these belong to</b> the carpenter. Whereas the mishna rules that the carpenter may keep what is removed with an adze, the <i>baraita</i> rules that it belongs to the customer.
The Gemara presents an answer: <b>Rava said: In the place of the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>there are two</b> kinds of <b>blades</b> used by carpenters: <b>The larger</b> blade <b>is called an ax, and the smaller</b> one <b>is called an adze.</b> By contrast, <b>in the place of the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, there is</b> only <b>one</b> carpenter’s <b>blade, and they called it an adze.</b> Consequently, the adze referred to in the <i>baraita</i> is actually an ax and the rulings are therefore congruent.
The mishna teaches: <b>And if he was doing</b> his work <b>in</b> the domain of the customer, then even the sawdust belongs to the customer. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:18): <b>Stone chiselers are not in</b> violation of a transgression <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery</b> if they take the leftover chips of rock. Furthermore, with regard to <b>those who prune trees, those who prune vines, those who trim shrubs, those who weed plants, and those who hoe vegetables,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is dependent upon the owner’s inclination: <b>When the owner is particular about</b> the plant trimmings, the workers <b>are in</b> violation of a transgression <b>due to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery</b> if they take the trimmings, but if <b>the owner is not particular about them,</b> then <b>these</b> items <b>belong to</b> the workers.
<b>Rav Yehuda says: Dodder [<i>keshut</i>] and green grain [<i>veḥaziz</i>], are not subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery,</b> as they grow on their own and no one tends to them. But <b>in a place where</b> people <b>are particular</b> about the ownership of dodder and green grain, <b>they are subject to</b> the prohibition against <b>robbery. Ravina said: And the city</b> of <b>Meḥasya is a city where</b> the residents <b>are particular</b> about dodder and green wheat.
