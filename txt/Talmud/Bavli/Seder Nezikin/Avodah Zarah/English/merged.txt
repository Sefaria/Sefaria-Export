Daf 2a



Daf 2b



Daf 3a



Is it not taught: R. Meir used to say. 
‘Whence do we know that even an idolater who studies the Torah is equal to a High Priest? 
From the following verse: 
Ye shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances which, if a man do, he shall live by them. It does not say "If a Priest, Levite, or Israelite do, he shall live by them," but "a man"; here, then, you can learn that even a heathen who studies the Torah is equal to a High Priest!’
