Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Partners who wished to make a partition [<i>meḥitza</i>] in</b> a jointly owned <b>courtyard build the wall</b> for the partition <b>in the middle</b> of the courtyard. What is this wall fashioned from? In <b>a place where it is customary to build</b> such a wall with <b>non-chiseled stone [<i>gevil</i>],</b> or <b>chiseled stone [<i>gazit</i>],</b> or <b>small bricks [<i>kefisin</i>],</b> or <b>large bricks [<i>leveinim</i>], they must build</b> the wall with that material. <b>Everything is in accordance with the regional custom.</b>
If they build the wall with <b>non-chiseled stone, this</b> partner <b>provides three handbreadths</b> of his portion of the courtyard <b>and that</b> partner <b>provides three handbreadths,</b> since the thickness of such a wall is six handbreadths. If they build the wall with <b>chiseled stone, this</b> partner <b>provides two and a half handbreadths and that</b> partner <b>provides two and a half handbreadths,</b> since such a wall is five handbreadths thick. If they build the wall <b>with small bricks, this</b> one <b>provides two handbreadths and that</b> one <b>provides two handbreadths,</b> since the thickness of such a wall is four handbreadths. If they build <b>with large bricks, this</b> one <b>provides one and a half handbreadths and that</b> one <b>provides one and a half handbreadths,</b> since the thickness of such a wall is three handbreadths. <b>Therefore, if the wall</b> later <b>falls,</b> the assumption is that <b>the space</b> where the wall stood <b>and the stones belong to both of them,</b> to be divided equally.
<b>And similarly with regard to a garden,</b> in <b>a place where it is customary to build a partition</b> in the middle of a garden jointly owned by two people, and one of them wishes to build such a partition, the court <b>obligates</b> his neighbor to join in building the partition. <b>But with regard to</b> an expanse of <b>fields [<i>babbika</i>],</b> in <b>a place where it is customary not to build a partition</b> between two people’s fields, and one person wishes to build a partition between his field and that of his neighbor, the court <b>does not obligate</b> his neighbor to build such a partition.
<b>Rather, if</b> one person <b>wishes</b> to erect a partition, <b>he must withdraw into his own</b> field <b>and build</b> the partition there. <b>And he makes</b> a border <b>mark on the outer side</b> of the barrier facing his neighbor’s property, indicating that he built the entire structure of his own materials and on his own land. <b>Therefore, if the wall</b> later <b>falls,</b> the assumption is that <b>the space</b> where the wall stood <b>and the stones</b> belong only <b>to him,</b> as is indicated by the mark on the wall.
Nevertheless, in a place where it is not customary to build a partition between two people’s fields, <b>if they made</b> such a partition <b>with the agreement of the two of them, they build it in the middle,</b> i.e., on the property line, <b>and make</b> a border <b>mark on the one</b> side <b>and on the other</b> side. <b>Therefore, if the wall</b> later <b>falls,</b> the assumption is that <b>the space</b> where the wall stood <b>and the stones</b> belong <b>to both of them,</b> to be divided equally.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages initially <b>assumed: What</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>meḥitza</i></b> mentioned in the mishna? It means <b>a partition, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Consider the case where <b>a partition of [<i>meḥitzat</i>] a vineyard</b> which separates the vineyard from a field of grain <b>was breached,</b> resulting, if the situation is not rectified, in the grain and grapes becoming items from which deriving benefit is prohibited due to the prohibition of diverse kinds planted in a vineyard. The owner of the field of grain may <b>say to</b> the owner of the vineyard: <b>Build a partition</b> between the vineyard and the field of grain. If the owner of the vineyard did so, and the partition <b>was breached again,</b> the owner of the field of grain may <b>say to him</b> again: <b>Build a partition.</b>

Daf 2b

If the owner of the vineyard <b>neglected</b> to make the necessary repairs <b>and did not</b> properly <b>build a partition</b> between the fields, the grain and grapes are <b>rendered forbidden</b> due to the prohibition of diverse kinds planted in a vineyard, <b>and he is liable for the</b> monetary <b>loss.</b> He must compensate the owner of the grain for the damage suffered, as it is the vineyard owner’s fault that deriving benefit from the grain is now prohibited.
According to the understanding that the term <i>meḥitza</i> means a partition, one can infer: <b>The reason</b> that they build a wall <b>is that they</b> both <b>wished</b> to make a partition in their jointly owned courtyard. <b>But if they did not</b> both <b>wish</b> to do so, the court <b>does not obligate</b> the reluctant partner to build such a wall, although his neighbor objects to the fact that the partner can see what he is doing in his courtyard. <b>Apparently,</b> it may be concluded that <b>damage</b> caused by <b>sight,</b> that is, the discomfort suffered by someone because he is exposed to the gaze of others while he is in his own private domain, <b>is not called damage.</b>
The Gemara objects to this conclusion: <b>But say</b> that the term <b><i>meḥitza</i></b> used in the mishna means <b>a division, as it is written: “And the division of [<i>meḥetzat</i>] the congregation was”</b> (Numbers 31:43), referring to the half of the spoil that belonged to the entire congregation. According to this interpretation the mishna means: <b>Since they wished</b> to divide the jointly owned courtyard, <b>they build</b> a proper <b>wall</b> in the center even <b>against the will</b> of one of the partners. <b>Apparently,</b> it may be concluded that <b>damage</b> caused by <b>sight is called damage.</b>
The Gemara rejects this line of reasoning: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the term <i>meḥitza</i> means a division, the words: <b>Who wished to make a division,</b> are imprecise, as the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have said: Who wished to divide. Rather, what</b> is the meaning of the term <i>meḥitza</i>? <b>A partition.</b> The Gemara retorts: If so, the words: <b>They build the wall,</b> are imprecise, as the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have said: They build it,</b> since the wall and the partition are one and the same. The Gemara responds: <b>Had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught:</b> They build <b>it, I would say that a mere partition of pegs [<i>bimseifas</i>]</b> would suffice. He therefore <b>teaches us</b> that they build an actual <b>wall,</b> all in accordance with the regional custom.
The mishna teaches: Partners who wished to make a partition in a jointly owned courtyard <b>build the wall</b> for the partition <b>in the middle</b> of the courtyard. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that if they agree to build a wall it should be built in the middle? Why should one of them contribute more than the other?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where one</b> of the partners <b>went ahead and convinced the other</b> that they should build a partition. <b>Lest you say</b> that the second <b>can</b> later <b>say to</b> the first when the latter comes to begin construction: <b>When I was persuaded by you</b> to build a partition, it was <b>with regard to the airspace.</b> I agreed to the erection of a minimal barrier that would result in a loss of open space in the courtyard. <b>But I was not persuaded by you with regard to the use</b> of the courtyard. I did not agree to forfeit any usable space on the ground in my share of the courtyard for the building of a wall. To counter this, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that since they agreed to make a partition, they must each contribute a part of the courtyard for the building of the wall.
§ After having determined that the wording of the mishna is unproblematic only if the term <i>meḥitza</i> means a wall, it follows that damage caused by sight is not called damage. The Gemara asks: <b>And is damage</b> caused by <b>sight</b> in fact <b>not called damage?</b> The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the proofs, which follow, that challenge this assumption: <b>Garden, wall, compels, and they divide, windows, as Rav Naḥman.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> that which the mishna teaches: <b>And similarly with regard to a garden,</b> in a place where it is customary to build a partition in the middle of a garden jointly owned by two people, and one of them wishes to build such a partition, the court obligates his neighbor to join in building the partition. This indicates that invading one’s privacy by looking at him while he is in his private domain is called damage.
The Gemara answers: <b>A garden is different</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> governing invasion of privacy, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Abba, as Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It is <b>prohibited for a person to stand in another’s field</b> and look at his crop <b>while</b> the grain <b>is standing,</b> because he casts an evil eye upon it and thereby causes him damage, and the same is true for a garden. Since the issue in this case is damage resulting from the evil eye, no proof can be brought with regard to the matter of damage caused by sight.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches: And similarly</b> with regard to a garden, which suggests that a garden and a courtyard are governed by the same rationale. The Gemara answers: The term: And similarly, is stated not with regard to the reason for the obligation to construct a wall, but <b>with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>non-chiseled and chiseled stones.</b> A partition in a garden is built with the same materials used for the building of a wall in a courtyard, in accordance with regional custom.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (5a): In the case of a dividing <b>wall</b> in a jointly owned <b>courtyard that fell,</b> if one of the owners wishes to rebuild the wall, the court <b>obligates</b> the other owner <b>to build</b> the wall with him again <b>up to</b> a height of <b>four cubits.</b> This indicates that damage caused by sight is called damage. The Gemara rejects this proof: The case of a wall that <b>fell is different;</b> since a wall had already stood there, the court compels the owners to rebuild it as it was.
The Gemara expresses its astonishment: <b>And he who asked</b> the question, <b>why did he ask it</b> at all? The mishna is clearly referring to a wall that has fallen, which means that the joint owners have already agreed in the past to build a partition between their respective portions. The Gemara answers: He who asked the question maintains that the joint owners can be compelled to build a wall even in a case where a wall had not stood there before, to prevent any invasion of privacy. And the mishna does not address the case of a wall that fell to teach that only in such a case is there an obligation to build a wall. Rather, <b>it was necessary</b> to teach <b>the latter clause,</b> which states that even in a case where there had previously been a high wall the court <b>does not obligate him</b> to rebuild it <b>higher than four cubits,</b> because once there is a wall of four cubits there is no further invasion of privacy.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an additional proof that damage caused by sight is called damage, from what is taught in a mishna (7b): The residents of a courtyard <b>can compel</b> each inhabitant of that courtyard <b>to</b> financially participate in the <b>building of a gatehouse and a door to the</b> jointly owned <b>courtyard,</b> so that the courtyard not be open to the eyes of those standing in the public domain. <b>Learn from it</b> that <b>damage</b> caused by <b>sight is called damage.</b> The Gemara answers: This is not a proof to the <i>halakha</i> in the case of two neighbors, as the <b>damage</b> of being exposed to the gaze <b>of</b> the general <b>public,</b> which has unimpeded sight of what is happening in the courtyard, <b>is different</b> and certainly called damage.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> exposure to the sight of <b>an individual not</b> considered damage? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that it is called damage from what is taught in a mishna (11a): <b>One divides a courtyard</b> at the request of one of the co-owners <b>only</b> if its area is sufficient so <b>that there will be in it four</b> by four <b>cubits for this one and four</b> by four <b>cubits for that one,</b> that is, the same minimal dimensions for each of the co-owners. This means that <b>if there is enough for this</b> one <b>and enough for that</b> one, <b>they do divide</b> the courtyard at the request of one of the owners. <b>What, is it not</b> so that the courtyard must be divided <b>with a wall</b> that will prevent one neighbor from seeing the other? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> perhaps it is divided <b>with a mere partition of pegs</b> through which one can still see.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof that damage caused by sight is called damage from what is taught in a mishna (22a): One who desires to build a wall opposite <b>the windows</b> of a neighbor’s house must distance the wall <b>four cubits</b> from the windows, <b>whether above, below, or opposite. And</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught with regard to</b> that mishna: Concerning the requirement of a distance <b>above,</b> the wall must be high <b>enough so that one cannot peer</b> into the window <b>and see</b> into the window; concerning the requirement of a distance <b>below,</b> the wall must be low <b>so that he will not</b> be able to <b>stand</b> on top of it <b>and see</b> into the window; <b>and</b> concerning the requirement of a distance <b>opposite,</b> one must distance the wall from the windows <b>so that it will not darken</b> his neighbor’s house by blocking the light that enters the house through the window. This indicates that there is a concern about the damage caused by exposure to the gaze of others.
The Gemara rejects this argument: The <b>damage</b> of being exposed to the sight of others while <b>in</b> one’s own <b>house is different,</b> as people engage in activities in their homes that they do not want others to see. By contrast, a courtyard is out in the open and it is possible that the residents are indifferent to being observed.
The Gemara challenges this distinction: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If one’s <b>roof is adjacent to another’s courtyard, he must make a parapet</b> around the roof <b>four cubits high</b> so that he will not be able to see into his neighbor’s courtyard. This indicates that the damage of being exposed to the eyes of others even in a courtyard is called damage. The Gemara refutes this proof: The situation <b>is different there, as the owner of the courtyard can say to the owner of the roof: I</b> make <b>use</b> of <b>my</b> courtyard <b>on a regular</b> basis. <b>You,</b> by contrast, <b>do not</b> make <b>use</b> of <b>your</b> roof <b>on a regular</b> basis, but only infrequently. Consequently, <b>I do not know when you will go up</b> to the roof,

Daf 3a

<b>so that I can hide from you</b> at that time and avoid coming under your gaze.
§ The Gemara has so far presented one version of the discussion of the mishna. <b>A different version relates</b> the discussion as follows: The Sages initially <b>assumed: What</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>meḥitza</i></b> mentioned in the mishna? <b>A division,</b> not a partition, <b>as it is written: “And the division of [<i>meḥetzat</i>] the congregation was”</b> (Numbers 31:43). According to this interpretation, the mishna means to say: <b>Since they wished</b> to divide the jointly owned courtyard, <b>they build</b> a proper <b>wall</b> in the center even <b>against the will</b> of one of the partners. <b>Apparently,</b> it may be concluded that <b>damage</b> caused by <b>sight is called damage.</b>
The Gemara objects to this conclusion: <b>But</b> why not <b>say: What</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>meḥitza</i></b> mentioned in the mishna? It means <b>a partition.</b> This usage would be <b>as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Consider the case where <b>a partition of [<i>meḥitzat</i>] a vineyard</b> which separates the vineyard from a field of grain <b>was breached,</b> resulting, if the situation is not rectified, in the grain and grapes becoming items from which deriving benefit is prohibited. The owner of the field of grain may <b>say to</b> the owner of the vineyard: <b>Build a partition</b> between the vineyard and the field of grain. If the owner of the vineyard did so, and the partition <b>was breached again,</b> the owner of the field of grain may <b>say to him</b> again: <b>Build a partition.</b> If the owner of the vineyard <b>neglected</b> to make the necessary repairs <b>and did not</b> properly <b>build a partition</b> between the fields, the grain and grapes are <b>rendered forbidden</b> due to the prohibition of diverse kinds planted in a vineyard, <b>and he is liable for the</b> monetary <b>loss.</b>
The Gemara concludes stating the objection: <b>And</b> according to the understanding that the term <i>meḥitza</i> means a partition, one can infer: <b>The reason</b> that they build a wall is <b>that they</b> both <b>wished</b> to make a partition in their jointly owned courtyard. <b>But if they did not</b> both <b>wish</b> to do so, the court <b>does not obligate</b> the reluctant partner to build such a wall, although his neighbor objects to the fact that the partner can see what he is doing in his courtyard. <b>Apparently,</b> it may be concluded that <b>damage</b> caused by <b>sight is not called damage.</b>
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>If so,</b> the words: <b>They build the wall,</b> are imprecise, as the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have said: They build it,</b> since the wall and the partition are one and the same. The Gemara retorts: <b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning of the term <i>meḥitza</i>? <b>A division. If</b> it is <b>so</b> that the term <i>meḥitza</i> means a division, the words: <b>Who wished to make a division,</b> are imprecise, as the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have said: Who wished to divide.</b> The Gemara answers: The phrasing of the mishna is <b>as people</b> commonly <b>say: Come, let us make a division.</b> Consequently, the mishna can also be understood as referring to two people who wished to divide a jointly owned area.
The Gemara asks, according to the understanding that <i>meḥitza</i> means division: <b>But if damage</b> caused by <b>sight is called damage, why</b> does the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically</b> teach that <b>if they wish,</b> they build a wall? <b>Even if they did not</b> both <b>wish</b> to do so, it should <b>also</b> be possible to compel the reluctant party to build a wall between them. <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Our mishna</b> is referring to a courtyard <b>that is not subject to the <i>halakha</i> of division.</b> Joint owners of a courtyard cannot be compelled to divide the courtyard unless each party will receive at least four square cubits of the courtyard. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>this</b> ruling of the mishna applies only in the case <b>where they</b> both <b>wished</b> to divide the courtyard.
The Gemara asks: According to this understanding, <b>what is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaching us?</b> Is he teaching us <b>that when</b> a courtyard <b>is not subject to the <i>halakha</i> of division, if they</b> nevertheless <b>wished</b> to do so, <b>they divide</b> it? But <b>we</b> already <b>learned</b> this in the latter clause of a different mishna (11a): <b>When</b> do they not divide the courtyard because it is not large enough to compel division? <b>When</b> the joint owners <b>do not both wish</b> to divide it. <b>But when both of them wish</b> to divide it, <b>they divide</b> it <b>even</b> if it is <b>smaller than this,</b> i.e., smaller than four square cubits for each party. The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> we had learned this <i>halakha</i> only <b>from there, I would say</b> that they divide the courtyard <b>even</b> if it is <b>smaller than this by</b> constructing <b>a mere partition of pegs,</b> which does not prevent invasion of privacy. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us here</b> in this mishna that if they wish to divide the courtyard they can be compelled to build a proper <b>wall.</b>
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach this</b> mishna <b>and not teach that</b> other mishna, as this mishna teaches more details than the later one. The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to teach the other mishna to introduce <b>the last clause</b> of that mishna, which states: <b>And</b> jointly owned <b>sacred writings</b> that are contained in a single scroll <b>should not be divided even if both</b> owners <b>wish</b> to do so.
The Gemara brings <b>a different version</b> of the previous discussion: <b>And if they wished</b> to divide the courtyard, <b>what of it?</b> What forces them to build the wall? If one of the parties does not wish to build a wall, <b>let him retract. Rav Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said</b> that the mishna is not discussing a case where they merely reached a verbal agreement to divide the courtyard, but rather with a case where each party <b>performed</b> an act of <b>acquisition with</b> the other, confirming their respective commitments. Therefore, neither side can retract.
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather than teaching us</b> a case <b>where</b> the courtyard <b>is not subject to the <i>halakha</i> of division, but</b> nevertheless <b>they wished</b> to divide it, <b>let</b> the mishna <b>teach us</b> a case <b>where</b> the courtyard <b>is subject to the <i>halakha</i> of division, even if they did not</b> both <b>wish</b> to divide it. The Gemara answers: <b>Had it taught us</b> only a case <b>where</b> the courtyard <b>is subject to the <i>halakha</i> of division</b> that applies <b>even if they did not</b> both <b>wish</b> to divide it, <b>I would say</b> that in a case where the courtyard <b>is not subject to the <i>halakha</i> of division</b> then <b>even if they</b> both <b>wished</b> to divide it, if one of the parties does not wish to build a proper wall he <b>cannot</b> be compelled to do so. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that he is compelled to participate.
The Gemara asks: <b>But how can you say this? Doesn’t the latter clause</b> of the mishna (11a) <b>teach: When</b> do they not divide the courtyard because it is not large enough to compel division? <b>When the</b> joint owners <b>do not both wish</b> to divide it. <b>But when both of them wish</b> to divide it, <b>they divide</b> it even if it is smaller than this. <b>What,</b> is this clause of the mishna <b>not</b> referring <b>to</b> the fact that either one can force the other to build a proper <b>wall?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is referring to <b>a mere partition of pegs</b> and not to an actual wall.
The Gemara asks: If so, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach this</b> mishna <b>and not teach that</b> other mishna, as this mishna teaches more details than the later one. The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary</b> to teach the other mishna for <b>the last clause</b> of that mishna, which states: <b>And</b> jointly owned <b>sacred writings</b> that are contained in a single scroll <b>should not be divided even if both</b> owners <b>wish</b> to do so. This concludes the alternative version of the discussion.
The Gemara continues its analysis of the mishna: <b>To what</b> case <b>did you interpret the mishna</b> to be referring? To a case <b>where</b> the courtyard <b>is not subject to the <i>halakha</i> of division.</b> But <b>if there is no <i>halakha</i> of division,</b> then <b>if they wished</b> to divide the courtyard, <b>what of it;</b> how can either one force the other to build a wall? If the parties no longer want to build a wall, <b>let them retract. Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> It is referring to a case where each party <b>performed</b> an act of <b>acquisition with</b> the other, confirming their respective commitments. Therefore, neither party can retract.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even <b>if</b> each party <b>performed</b> an act of <b>acquisition with</b> the other, <b>what of it? It is merely a verbal acquisition,</b> meaning there was no actual transfer of property, but only a verbal agreement to act in a certain manner in the future and not a true act of acquisition. The Gemara answers: <b>They performed</b> an act of <b>acquisition with</b> the other <b>with regard to directions,</b> i.e., not only did they verbally agree to divide the courtyard, they also determined which of them would get which part of the courtyard. Consequently, the acquisition related to actual property, a particular plot of land. <b>Rav Ashi said: For example, this one walked through his</b> designated portion and <b>performed an act demonstrating ownership</b> there, <b>and that one walked through his</b> designated portion <b>and performed an act demonstrating ownership</b> there.
§ The mishna teaches: In <b>a place where it is customary to build</b> such a wall with non-chiseled stone [<i>gevil</i>], or chiseled stone [<i>gazit</i>], or small bricks [<i>kefisin</i>], or large bricks [<i>leveinim</i>], they must build the wall with that material. The Gemara identifies the various building materials: <b><i>Gevil</i></b> refers to <b>stones that are not planed. <i>Gazit</i></b> means <b>stones that are planed, as it is written: “All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of chiseled stones [<i>gazit</i>],</b> sawed with saws, within and without” (I Kings 7:9). This teaches that chiseled stones are those that have been planed and smoothened. <b><i>Kefisin</i></b> refers to <b>small bricks. <i>Leveinim</i></b> means <b>large bricks.</b>
<b>Rabba, the son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: From where</b> do you know <b>that <i>gevil</i></b> refers to <b>stones that are not planed, and this extra handbreadth</b> that a wall of <i>gevil</i> has compared to what a wall of <i>gazit</i> has is <b>for the protruding edges?</b> That is, a wall of <i>gevil</i> is six handbreadths thick because the stones have not been planed and smoothened, and therefore protrude somewhat outward. <b>Perhaps</b> <i>gevil</i> refers to planed stones that <b>are half</b> the thickness <b>of <i>gazit</i>,</b> namely, just two and a half handbreadths, as compared to <i>gazit</i>, which is five handbreadths thick; <b>and this extra handbreadth</b> in a wall of <i>gevil</i> <b>is</b> for the space <b>between the</b> two <b>rows [<i>urbei</i>].</b> That is, a wall of <i>gevil</i> is actually two walls of planed stones that are each two and a half handbreadths thick; and the two walls are separated by one handbreadth, which is later filled in with mortar for added strength.
A proof for this explanation can be brought from <b>what we say,</b> i.e., that <b><i>kefisin</i></b> are <b>small bricks,</b> whereas <b><i>leveinim</i></b> are <b>large bricks,</b> twice the thickness of small bricks. <b>And this extra handbreadth</b> of thickness that a wall of <i>kefisin</i> has compared to what a wall of <i>levinim</i> has is for the space <b>between the</b> two <b>rows</b> of small bricks.
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning, from where do we</b> derive that <b><i>kefisin</i></b> are <b>small bricks? Rather,</b> the Sages <b>learned this as a tradition.</b> And <b>so too, they learned as a tradition</b> that <b><i>gevil</i> refers to non-planed stones.</b>
The Gemara presents a different version of the discussion. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: From where</b> do you know <b>that <i>kefisin</i> are small bricks,</b> one-half the width of large bricks, <b>and this extra handbreadth</b> of thickness that a wall of <i>kefisin</i> has compared to what a wall of <i>leveinim</i> has covers the space <b>between the</b> two <b>rows</b> of <i>kefisin</i>? <b>Perhaps</b> you should say <b>what</b> are <b><i>kefisin</i>? Stones that</b> are <b>not planed, and this extra handbreadth</b> of thickness that a wall of <i>kefisin</i> has in comparison to what a wall of <i>leveinim</i> has <b>is for the protruding edges.</b> And proof for this explanation can be brought from <b>what we say,</b> i.e., that <b><i>gevil</i></b> refers to <b>stones that</b> are <b>not planed,</b> whereas <b><i>gazit</i></b> means <b>planed stones, and this extra handbreadth</b> of thickness that a wall of <i>gevil</i> has compared to what a wall of <i>gazit</i> has <b>is for the protruding edges.</b>
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning, from where do we</b> derive that <b><i>gevil</i> are stones that</b> are <b>not planed? Rather,</b> the Sages <b>learned</b> this <b>as a tradition. Here too, they learned as a tradition</b> that <i>kefisin</i> are small bricks.
<b>Abaye said: Learn from it</b> that the space left <b>between the</b> two <b>rows</b> of a wall <b>is always a handbreadth.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>This matter</b> applies only when the two rows of the wall are filled in <b>with mortar. But</b> when they are filled in <b>with gravel [<i>berikhsa</i>], more</b> space <b>is required. And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>this matter</b> applies only when the two rows of the wall are filled in <b>with gravel. But when mortar</b> is used to fill in the space, <b>not as much</b> space <b>is required,</b> and less than a handbreadth suffices.
§ The Gemara asks: Is this <b>to say that</b> in the case of a wall of <b>chiseled stone, if for every four cubits of height there are five</b> handbreadths <b>of thickness</b> the wall <b>will stand,</b> and <b>if not it will not stand,</b> as this is the required ratio between a wall’s height and its thickness? <b>But wasn’t there</b> the <b>one-cubit-thick wall separating the Holy of Holies from the Sanctuary of the Temple [<i>amah teraksin</i>]</b> separating the Holy of Holies from the Sanctuary, <b>which was thirty cubits high and its thickness was only six handbreadths and</b> nevertheless <b>stood?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since there was an extra handbreadth</b> of thickness, it was able to <b>stand</b> even to such a great height.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>in the Second Temple they did not fashion an <i>amah teraksin</i></b> to separate between the Holy of Holies and the Sanctuary, as they had done in the First Temple? The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> a partition <b>stands</b> even though it is only six handbreadths thick, <b>it is</b> able to remain standing up to <b>thirty</b> cubits in height. But <b>it will not</b> be able to <b>stand</b> if it is <b>more</b> than that height. The Second Temple was taller than the First Temple, and therefore the partition separating the Holy of Holies from the Sanctuary also had to be higher.
The Gemara comments: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that</b> the Second Temple <b>was taller</b> than the First Temple? <b>As it is written: “The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former”</b> (Haggai 2:9). <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagree about the meaning of this verse, <b>and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar</b> who disagreed as to its meaning. <b>One</b> of them <b>said</b> that it means that the Second Temple will be greater <b>in</b> the size of its <b>structure,</b> i.e., taller. <b>And one</b> of them <b>said</b>

Daf 3b

that it will be greater <b>in years,</b> meaning that the Second Temple will stand for a longer period of time than the First Temple. <b>And</b> the Gemara comments that <b>this is</b> true <b>and that is</b> true, meaning that the Second Temple was taller than the First Temple and also stood for a longer period of time.
The Gemara asks: If so, if the Second Temple building was taller, then to separate between the Holy of Holies and the Sanctuary in the Second Temple <b>they should have made a wall thirty cubits</b> high <b>and</b> then <b>made a curtain</b> for <b>the rest</b> of the height, the seventy-cubit difference in height between the First and Second Temples. The Gemara answers: This would have been impossible, as <b>even when a thirty-cubit</b> wall that is six handbreadths thick <b>stands, it is due to the ceiling and plaster</b> which attaches it to the ceiling that <b>it stands.</b> But <b>without a ceiling and plaster</b> holding it in place, <b>it does not stand.</b>
The Gemara continues: <b>But they should have made a wall</b> as high <b>as</b> can <b>possibly</b> stand by itself, <b>and</b> then should have <b>made a curtain</b> for <b>the rest</b> of the height. <b>Abaye said:</b> The Sages <b>learned</b> as a tradition that the partition separating the Holy of Holies from the Sanctuary should be built <b>either entirely as a wall or entirely as a curtain.</b> It should be built <b>either entirely as a wall,</b> as is learned <b>from</b> the First <b>Temple, or</b> it should be built <b>entirely as a curtain,</b> as is learned <b>from</b> the <b>Tabernacle.</b> At no time, however, was there a partition that combined a wall and a curtain.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Do the measurements given in the mishna apply to <b>them,</b> the thickness of the materials themselves, <b>and the plaster</b> with which the materials were coated, <b>or perhaps</b> just to <b>them without their plaster? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: It is reasonable</b> to say the measurements refer to <b>them and their plaster, as, if</b> it should <b>enter your mind</b> to say they refer to <b>them without their plaster,</b> then the <i>tanna</i> <b>should have taught the measurements</b> of the plaster as well. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from here</b> that the measurements refer to <b>them and their plaster?</b> The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <b>No, actually I</b> could <b>say to you</b> that they apply to <b>them without their plaster, and since</b> the plaster <b>does not have</b> the thickness of <b>one handbreadth</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>did not teach</b> such a small measurement.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach with regard to bricks</b> that <b>this</b> one <b>provides one and a half handbreadths, and that</b> one <b>provides one and a half handbreadths?</b> Evidently, the <i>tanna</i> lists even an amount less than one handbreadth. The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> mention is made of half-handbreadths because <b>they are fit to be combined</b> into a full handbreadth.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to the question, from a mishna (<i>Eiruvin</i> 13b) in which it is taught: <b>The</b> cross <b>beam, which</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> may be used to render an alleyway fit for one to carry within it on Shabbat, must be <b>wide enough to receive</b> and hold <b>a small brick. And</b> this <b>small brick</b> is <b>half a large brick,</b> the width <b>of</b> which is <b>three handbreadths.</b> That mishna is referring to a brick without the plaster.
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the mishna in <i>Eiruvin</i> is referring to <b>large bricks</b> that measure three full handbreadths, whereas here the mishna is referring to bricks that measure slightly less than three handbreadths, and the measurement of three handbreadths includes the plaster with which they are coated. The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna there <b>is also precise, as it teaches</b> about a brick <b>of three handbreadths,</b> from which one can conclude <b>by inference that there exists</b> also <b>a smaller-</b>sized brick. The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from here</b> that the mishna there is referring to large bricks.
§ <b>Rav Ḥisda says: A person may not demolish a synagogue until he</b> first <b>builds another synagogue</b> to take its place. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the reason for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>due to</b> potential <b>negligence,</b> lest he fail to build a new structure after the old one has been razed. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the reason for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>due to</b> the disruption of <b>prayer,</b> for in the meantime there will be nowhere to pray.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> these two explanations? The Gemara answers that <b>there is</b> a difference <b>between them</b> in a situation <b>where there is another synagogue.</b> Even though the community has an alternative place to pray there is still a concern that the new synagogue will never get built. It is related that <b>Mareimar and Mar Zutra demolished and built a summer synagogue in the winter, and,</b> in like manner, <b>they built a winter synagogue in the summer,</b> so that the community would never be left without a synagogue.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if <b>money</b> for the construction of a new synagogue <b>has</b> already <b>been collected and it rests</b> before us for that purpose? Is it then permitted to demolish the old synagogue before building the new one? Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> Even if the money has been collected there is still concern that <b>perhaps</b> an opportunity for <b>redeeming captives will present itself, and they will hand over</b> the money for that urgent requirement, and the community will be left without a synagogue.
Ravina continues: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if <b>the bricks</b> to be used for the construction of the new synagogue <b>are piled up, the boards are prepared, and the beams are ready?</b> Is it permitted to demolish the old synagogue before building the new one? Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> Even so, <b>sometimes</b> an opportunity for <b>redeeming captives will present itself, and they will sell</b> the building materials <b>and hand over</b> the proceeds for this purpose. Ravina raises an objection: <b>If so,</b> that is, if you are concerned that they will sell the materials to redeem captives, then <b>even</b> in a case where <b>they</b> already <b>built</b> the synagogue there should be a concern that they might come to sell the structure for that purpose, and therefore one should never be permitted to destroy an old synagogue. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: People do not sell their residences,</b> and certainly not their synagogues.
The Gemara comments: <b>And we said</b> that an old synagogue must not be razed before its replacement is built <b>only</b> in a case <b>where cracks are not seen</b> in the old synagogue. <b>But if cracks are seen they may</b> first <b>demolish</b> the old synagogue <b>and</b> then <b>build</b> the new one. <b>This is like</b> the incident involving <b>Rav Ashi,</b> who <b>saw cracks in the synagogue</b> in his town <b>of Mata Meḥasya</b> and immediately <b>demolished it. He</b> then <b>brought his bed in there,</b> to the building site, so that there should be no delays in the construction, as he himself required shelter from the rain, <b>and he did not remove</b> his bed from there <b>until they</b> finished building the synagogue and even <b>affixed drainpipes</b> to the structure.
The Gemara asks: <b>How could Bava ben Buta have advised Herod to raze the Temple</b> and build another in its place, as will be described later? <b>But doesn’t Rav Ḥisda say</b> that <b>a person must not demolish a synagogue unless he</b> first <b>builds another synagogue</b> to take its place? The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>he saw cracks in</b> the old Temple structure. And <b>if you wish, say</b> that actions taken by <b>the government are different, as</b> the government <b>does not go back</b> on its decisions. Therefore, there is no need to be concerned about negligence, as there is in the case of ordinary people. <b>As Shmuel says: If the government says</b> it will <b>uproot mountains, it will uproot mountains and not retract</b> its word.
§ The Gemara elaborates on the episode involving Bava ben Buta. <b>Herod was a slave in the house of the Hasmoneans. He set his eyes upon a certain young girl</b> from the house of the Hasmoneans. <b>One day that man,</b> Herod, <b>heard a Divine Voice that said: Any slave who rebels now will succeed. He rose up</b> and <b>killed all his masters, but spared that girl. When that girl saw that he wanted to marry her, she went up to the roof and raised her voice,</b> and <b>said: Whoever comes and says: I come from the house of the Hasmoneans, is a slave, since only that girl,</b> i.e., I, <b>remained from them. And that girl fell from the roof to the ground</b> and died.
It is related that Herod <b>preserved</b> the girl’s body <b>in honey for seven years</b> to prevent it from decaying. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>he engaged in necrophilia with her</b> corpse and <b>there are</b> those <b>who say he did not engage in necrophilia with her</b> corpse. According to those <b>who say he engaged in necrophilia with her</b> corpse, the reason <b>that he preserved her</b> body was <b>to gratify his</b> carnal <b>desires. And</b> according to those <b>who say he did not engage in necrophilia with her</b> corpse, the reason <b>that he preserved her</b> body was <b>so that</b> people <b>would say he married a king’s daughter.</b>
Herod <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Who expounds</b> the verse: <b>“One from among your brothers you shall set as king over you”</b> (Deuteronomy 17:15) as meaning that he who is appointed as king must come from a Jewish family and cannot be an emancipated slave or a convert? It is <b>the Sages</b> who expound the verse in this manner, insisting that a king must have Jewish roots. <b>He</b> then <b>rose up and killed all the Sages,</b> but <b>spared Bava ben Buta in order to take counsel with him.</b>

Daf 4a

Herod <b>placed a garland</b> made <b>of porcupine</b> hide <b>on</b> Bava ben Buta’s head, which <b>pricked his eyes out. One day</b> Herod <b>came and sat before him</b> without identifying himself in order to test him. <b>He,</b> Herod, <b>said: See, Master, what this evil slave</b> Herod <b>is doing.</b> Bava ben Buta <b>said to him: What should I do to him?</b> Herod <b>said to him:</b> The <b>Master should curse him.</b> Bava ben Buta <b>said to him:</b> But <b>it is written: “Do not curse the king, not even in your thoughts”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:20). Herod <b>said to him: He is not a king,</b> since he rules illegally. Bava ben Buta <b>said to him: And</b> even if <b>he were merely a rich man</b> I would not curse him, as <b>it is written: “And do not curse a rich person in your bedchamber”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:20). <b>And</b> even <b>were he only a leader</b> I would not curse him, as <b>it is written: “And you shall not curse a leader among your people”</b> (Exodus 22:27).
Herod <b>said to him:</b> That <i>halakha</i> stated <b>with regard to</b> “a leader among your people,” that is, to a fit Jew who <b>acts as</b> a member of <b>your people,</b> i.e., in accordance with Torah law, <b>and this one does not do the deeds of your people.</b> Bava ben Buta <b>said to him:</b> Nevertheless, <b>I am afraid of him.</b> Herod <b>said to him: There is nobody who will go and tell him, since you and I are sitting</b> here alone. Bava ben Buta <b>said to him:</b> Nevertheless, <b>it is written: “For a bird of the sky shall carry the sound, and that which has wings shall tell the matter”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:20).
Herod <b>said to him: I am he. Had I known that the Sages were so cautious I would not have killed them. Now, what is that man’s remedy,</b> i.e., what can I do to repent for my sinful actions? Bava ben Buta <b>said to him: He</b> who <b>extinguished the light of the world</b> by killing the Torah Sages, <b>as it is written: “For the mitzva is a lamp, and the Torah is light”</b> (Proverbs 6:23), <b>should go and occupy himself with the light of the world,</b> the Temple, <b>as it is written</b> with regard to the Temple: <b>“And all the nations shall flow [<i>venaharu</i>] unto it”</b> (Isaiah 2:2), the word <i>venaharu</i> alluding to light [<i>nehora</i>]. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>he said to him: He</b> who <b>blinded the eye of the world, as it is written</b> in reference to the Sages: <b>“And if</b> it be committed through ignorance <b>by the eyes of the congregation”</b> (Numbers 15:24), <b>should go and occupy himself with the eye of the world,</b> the Temple, <b>as it is written: “I will desecrate my Temple, the pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes”</b> (Ezekiel 24:21).
Herod <b>said to him: I am afraid of the</b> Roman <b>government,</b> that they will not permit me to make changes in the Temple. Bava ben Buta <b>said to him: Send a messenger</b> who will <b>travel</b> there for <b>a year, and remain</b> there for another <b>year, and</b> take yet another <b>year</b> to <b>return. In the meantime, you can demolish</b> the Temple <b>and rebuild it. He did so.</b> Eventually, <b>they sent</b> a message <b>to</b> Herod from Rome: <b>If you have not</b> yet <b>demolished it, do not demolish it; and if you have</b> already <b>demolished it, do not rebuild it; and if you have demolished it and</b> already <b>rebuilt it,</b> you shall be counted among <b>those who act wickedly, seeking counsel</b> only <b>after they have</b> already <b>acted.</b> Even <b>if you are armed</b> and in command of a military force, <b>your book,</b> i.e., your genealogical record, <b>is here.</b> You are <b>neither a king [<i>reikha</i>] nor the son of a king,</b> but rather <b>Herod the slave who has made himself a freeman [<i>kelonya</i>].</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the word <b><i>reikha</i>?</b> It denotes <b>royalty, as it is written: “I am today a tender [<i>rakh</i>] and anointed king”</b> (II Samuel 3:39). <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the meaning of the word is learned <b>from here,</b> from the term describing Joseph after he was appointed viceroy to the king: <b>“And they cried before him, <i>Avrekh</i>”</b> (Genesis 41:43).
The Sages <b>say: One who has not seen Herod’s building has never seen a beautiful building in his life.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With what did he build it? Rabba said: With stones of white and green marble [<i>umarmara</i>]. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that he built it <b>with stones of blue, white, and green marble.</b> Alternate rows of stones <b>sent out an edge</b> a bit <b>and drew in an edge</b> a bit, <b>so that they would</b> better <b>receive</b> and hold <b>the plaster. He considered covering it with gold,</b> but <b>the Rabbis said to him: Leave it,</b> and do not cover it, <b>since it is more beautiful this</b> way, <b>as it looks like the waves of the sea.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And how did Bava ben Buta do this,</b> i.e., give advice to Herod the wicked? <b>But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> who says: <b>For what</b> reason <b>was Daniel punished? Because he offered advice to Nebuchadnezzar, as</b> after sharing a harsh prophecy with him, <b>it is stated: “Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, redeem your sins with charity and your iniquities with graciousness to the poor, that there may be a lengthening of your prosperity”</b> (Daniel 4:24). <b>And it is written: “All this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar”</b> (Daniel 4:25). <b>And it is written: “And at the end of twelve months”</b> (Daniel 4:26). Only after a year was the prophecy fulfilled but not before that, apparently because Nebuchadnezzar heeded Daniel’s advice.
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>a slave</b> like Herod <b>is different since he is obligated in the mitzvot,</b> and therefore Bava ben Buta had to help him repent. <b>And if you wish, say the Temple is different, as without</b> the help of <b>the government it would not have been built.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that Daniel was punished? If we say</b> we know this <b>because it is written: “And Esther called for Hatach,</b> one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her” (Esther 4:5), <b>and Rav said: Hatach is Daniel. This works out well according to the one who says</b> Daniel was called Hatach because <b>they cut him down [<i>ḥatakh</i>] from his greatness</b> and turned him into a minor attendant. <b>But according to the one who says</b> he was called Hatach <b>because all governmental matters were determined [<i>ḥatakh</i>] according to his word, what is there to say?</b> What punishment did he receive? The Gemara answers: His punishment was <b>that they threw him into the den of lions.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: In a place where it is customary to build a wall of non-chiseled stone, or chiseled stone, or small bricks, or large bricks, they must build the partition with that material. <b>Everything is in accordance with the regional custom.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does the word <b>everything</b> serve <b>to add?</b> The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to add a place where it is customary</b> to build a partition <b>out of palm and laurel branches.</b> In such a place, the partition is built from those materials.
The mishna teaches: <b>Therefore, if the wall</b> later <b>falls,</b> the assumption is that <b>the space</b> where the wall stood <b>and the stones belong to both of them,</b> to be divided equally. The Gemara questions the need for this ruling: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that this is the case, since both neighbors participated in the construction of the wall? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> for a case <b>where</b> the entire wall <b>fell into the domain of one of them. Alternatively,</b> it is necessary in a case <b>where one of them</b> already <b>cleared</b> all the stones <b>into his</b> own <b>domain. Lest you say</b> that <b>the other</b> party <b>should be</b> governed by the principle that <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> that is, if the other party should have to prove that he had been a partner in the construction of the wall, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that they are presumed to have been partners in the building of the wall, and neither requires further proof.
§ The mishna continues: <b>And similarly with regard to a garden,</b> in <b>a place where it is customary to build a partition</b> in the middle of a garden jointly owned by two people, and one of them wishes to build such a partition, the court <b>obligates</b> his neighbor to join in building the partition. The Gemara comments: <b>This</b> matter <b>itself</b> is <b>difficult.</b> On the one hand, <b>you said: And similarly with regard to a garden,</b> in <b>a place where it is customary to build a partition</b> in the middle of a garden jointly owned by two people, and one of them wishes to build such a partition, the court <b>obligates</b> his neighbor to join in building the partition. One can infer <b>that ordinarily,</b> where there is no custom, the court <b>does not obligate him</b> to build a partition.
But <b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>But</b> with regard to an expanse of <b>fields,</b> in <b>a place where it is customary not to build a partition</b> between two people’s fields, and one person wishes to build a partition between his field and that of his neighbor, the court <b>does not obligate</b> his neighbor to build such a partition. One can infer <b>that ordinarily,</b> where there is no custom, the court <b>obligates him</b> to build a partition. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Now</b> that <b>you said</b> by inference that in <b>an ordinary garden</b> the court <b>does not</b> obligate him to build a partition, <b>is it necessary</b> to say that the court does not obligate him to build a partition in <b>an ordinary field?</b> Clearly in a field there is less of a need for a partition, as there is less damage caused by exposure to the gaze of others.
<b>Abaye said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: And similarly</b> with regard to <b>an ordinary garden, and</b> also <b>in a place where it is customary to build a partition in</b> an expanse of <b>fields,</b> the court <b>obligates him</b> to build a partition. <b>Rava said to him: If so, what</b> is the point of the word: <b>But,</b> mentioned afterward in connection with an expanse of fields, which seems to indicate that the issue of fields had not yet been addressed? <b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> <b>is teaching: And similarly an ordinary garden is</b> treated <b>like a place where it is customary to build a partition, and</b> therefore the court <b>obligates him</b> to build a partition. <b>But an ordinary</b> expanse of <b>fields is</b> treated <b>like a place where it is customary not</b> to build a partition, <b>and</b> therefore the court <b>does not obligate him</b> to build one.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rather, if</b> one person <b>wishes</b> to erect a partition, <b>he must withdraw into his own</b> field <b>and build</b> the partition there. <b>And he makes</b> a border <b>mark on the outer side</b> of the barrier facing his neighbor’s property, indicating that he built the entire structure of his own materials and on his own land. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of a border <b>mark? Rav Huna said: He bends the edge</b> of the wall <b>toward the outside.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let him make it on the inside.</b> The Gemara explains: In that case, <b>his neighbor might also make</b> a mark <b>on the outside,</b> that is, on the side facing his own property, <b>and say:</b> The wall <b>is</b> both <b>mine and his.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>If so,</b> that is, there is a concern about such deception, <b>now also</b> when the person who builds the wall makes a border mark on the outer side of the wall, <b>his neighbor might cut it off and say:</b> The wall <b>is</b> both <b>mine and his.</b> The Gemara answers: Such <b>a cut is noticeable</b> and the deception will not work.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that in answer to the question: What is the meaning of a border mark, <b>Rav Huna said: He bends the edge</b> of the wall <b>toward the inside.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let him make it on the outside.</b> The Gemara explains: In that case, <b>his neighbor might cut it off and say:</b> The wall <b>is</b> both <b>mine and his.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that is, there is a concern for such deception, <b>now also</b> when the person who builds the wall makes a border mark toward the inside, <b>his neighbor might add</b> a border mark on his own side <b>and say:</b> The wall <b>is</b> both <b>mine and his.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>An addition is noticeable</b> and the deception will not work. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> that he makes the border mark <b>on the outside</b> and not on the inside? The Gemara comments: This is <b>a difficulty.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b>

Daf 4b

The party who builds the wall <b>should smear it</b> with clay <b>up to a cubit</b> at the top of the wall <b>on the outside.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let him do</b> this <b>on the inside.</b> The Gemara explains: In that case, <b>his neighbor might</b> also <b>do</b> it <b>on the outside,</b> that is, on the side facing his own property, <b>and say:</b> The wall <b>is</b> both <b>mine and his.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>If so,</b> that is, if there is a concern for such deception, <b>now also</b> when the person who builds the wall smears it with clay on the outside, <b>his neighbor can peel it off and say:</b> The wall <b>is</b> both <b>mine and his.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Peeling</b> clay <b>is noticeable</b> and the deception will not succeed.
The Gemara asks: If he builds a partition of <b>palm branches,</b> how does he make a border mark? <b>Rav Naḥman said: He directs the tips of the branches to the outside.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let him do</b> this <b>to the inside.</b> The Gemara states: If he so directs the branches, <b>his neighbor might also do</b> the same <b>to the outside,</b> that is, to the side facing his own property, <b>and say:</b> The partition <b>is</b> both <b>mine and his.</b> The Gemara objects: <b>If so,</b> that is, if there is concern for such deception, <b>now also</b> when the one who builds the partition directs the tips of the branches to the outside, the neighbor <b>can cut off</b> the tips <b>and throw</b> them away, <b>and say:</b> The partition <b>is</b> both <b>mine and his.</b> The Gemara counsels: <b>He should smear</b> the tips of the palm branches <b>with clay.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Now also, the neighbor might come and peel</b> the clay off. The Gemara answers: <b>Peeling is noticeable.</b>
<b>Abaye said:</b> One who builds a partition of <b>palm branches has no remedy</b> to prove who erected it, <b>except with</b> a written <b>document.</b> The neighbor should draw up a document stating that he has no claim to the space or to the partition, because they belong exclusively to the other neighbor.
§ The mishna teaches: Nevertheless, in a place where it is not customary to build a partition between two people’s fields, <b>if they made</b> such a partition <b>with the agreement of the two of them,</b> they build it in the middle, i.e., on the property line, and make a border mark on the one side and on the other side. Therefore, if the wall later falls, the assumption is that the space where the wall stood and the stones belong to both of them, to be divided equally. <b>Rava from Parzika said to Rav Ashi: Neither this one nor that one should make</b> a border mark. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: No,</b> this ruling <b>is necessary</b> in a case <b>where one of them went ahead and made</b> a border mark <b>for himself,</b> so that <b>if his neighbor does not make</b> one as well, the first one <b>will say</b> that <b>it is</b> entirely <b>his.</b>
Rava from Parzika asked him: <b>And is the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>teaching us a remedy</b> to be used <b>against a swindler?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: But isn’t the former clause</b> of the mishna’s ruling also <b>a remedy</b> to be used <b>against a swindler?</b> That clause teaches that one who builds a wall should make a border mark to indicate that the wall is his.
Rava from Parzika <b>said to him: Granted,</b> in <b>the former clause</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught the <i>halakha</i></b> that if one wishes to build a partition between his own field and that of his neighbor, he does so at his own expense and on his own land, <b>and due to</b> the need to teach that <b><i>halakha</i> he</b> also <b>taught a remedy</b> to be used against a swindler. <b>But does he teach a <i>halakha</i></b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> so <b>that he</b> also <b>teaches a remedy</b> to be used against a swindler? <b>Ravina said: Here,</b> in the latter clause, <b>we are dealing with</b> a barrier made of <b>palm branches.</b> This is <b>to the exclusion</b> of the opinion <b>of Abaye, who said:</b> One who builds a partition of <b>palm branches has no remedy</b> to prove who erected it, <b>except with</b> a written <b>document. He teaches us that</b> a border <b>mark suffices.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who surrounds another on three sides,</b> that is, he owns parcels of land on three sides of the other person’s field, <b>and he built a partition</b> on <b>the first, the second, and the third</b> sides, the court <b>does not obligate</b> the neighbor who owns the inner field to contribute to the construction of the partition if he does not wish to do so. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: If he arose and built a partition</b> on <b>the fourth</b> side of the field, the court <b>imposes upon</b> the owner of the inner field the responsibility to pay his share for <b>all</b> of the partitions.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who says</b> that <b>if he arose and built a partition</b> on <b>the fourth</b> side of the field, the court <b>imposes upon</b> the owner of the inner field the responsibility to pay his share for <b>all</b> of the partitions. The Gemara comments: It <b>is no different</b> if it was the owner of the <b>surrounded</b> field who <b>arose</b> and built a partition on the fourth side, and it <b>is no different</b> if it was the owner of the <b>surrounding</b> field who <b>arose</b> and built a partition on the fourth side. The <i>halakha</i> is the same in both cases.
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to the following point. <b>Rav Huna says</b> that when Rabbi Yosei said the court obligates the owner of the inner field to pay his share for <b>all</b> of the partitions, he pays <b>in accordance with what</b> the other person actually spent when he <b>built the partitions.</b> That is, the owner of the inner field must contribute his share according to the cost of the partition his neighbor built. <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav says:</b> He must pay his share for <b>all</b> of the partitions <b>in accordance with a reduced</b> assessment of the <b>price of reeds,</b> and no more. The owner of the surrounded field can claim he had no desire for a more substantial partition.
The Gemara attempts to bring a proof from what <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>one who surrounds another on three sides,</b> that is, he owns parcels of land on three sides of the other person’s field, <b>and he built a partition</b> on <b>the first, the second, and the third</b> sides, the court <b>does not obligate</b> the neighbor who owns the inner field to contribute to the construction of the partition. By inference, if he also built a partition on the <b>fourth</b> side of the field, the court <b>does obligate</b> the owner of the inner field to contribute to the building of the partition. The Gemara continues with its proof: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei says: If he arose and built a partition</b> on <b>the fourth</b> side of the field, the court <b>imposes upon</b> the owner of the inner field the responsibility to pay his share for <b>all</b> of the partitions. The first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yosei seem to be stating the same ruling.
<b>Granted, according to Rav Huna, who says</b> that the owner of the inner field pays for <b>all</b> of the partitions <b>in accordance with what</b> the other person actually spent when he <b>built the partitions, this is</b> the difference <b>between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yosei: The first <i>tanna</i> maintains</b> that <b>yes,</b> he pays his share for <b>all</b> of the partitions <b>in accordance with a reduced</b> assessment of the <b>price of reeds, but not</b> a larger sum in accordance with <b>what</b> the other person actually spent when he <b>built the partitions. And Rabbi Yosei maintains</b> that he pays his share for <b>all</b> of the partitions <b>in accordance with what</b> the other person actually spent when he <b>built the partitions.</b>
<b>But according to Ḥiyya bar Rav, who says</b> he pays his share for <b>all</b> of the partitions <b>in accordance with the value of</b> a partition fashioned from <b>inexpensive reeds, what</b> difference <b>is there between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yosei? If</b> according to the first <i>tanna</i> <b>he does not give him</b> his share for all of the partitions in accordance with <b>a reduced</b> assessment of the <b>price of reeds, what does he give him?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say there is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to <b>the wage of a watchman. The first <i>tanna</i> maintains</b> that <b>yes,</b> since his field is safeguarded by the partition which surrounds it, the one who built the partition can demand payment of <b>the wage of a watchman.</b> He cannot, however, demand the cost of building the partition, <b>not</b> even the other’s share for all of the partitions in accordance with <b>a reduced</b> assessment of the <b>price of reeds. And Rabbi Yosei maintains</b> that he can demand the other’s share for all of the partitions in accordance with <b>a reduced</b> assessment of the <b>price of reeds.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say there is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the partitions built on the <b>first, second, and third</b> sides of the inner field. <b>The first <i>tanna</i> maintains</b> that the owner of the inner field must <b>give to</b> his neighbor money for the partition built on the <b>fourth</b> side, <b>but</b> he is <b>not</b> required to <b>give him</b> money for the partitions built on the <b>first, second, and third</b> sides. <b>And Rabbi Yosei maintains</b> that <b>he</b> must <b>also give him</b> money <b>for</b> the partitions built on <b>the first, the second, and the third</b> sides.
The Gemara suggests another difference between the two opinions: <b>If you wish, say there is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the issue of whether the partition on the fourth side was built by the owner of the <b>surrounding</b> field <b>or</b> by the owner of the <b>surrounded</b> field. This is <b>because the first <i>tanna</i> maintains</b> that <b>the reason</b> the owner of the <b>surrounded</b> field must contribute his share of the entire expense is <b>that he arose</b> and built a partition on the fourth side of his field. Therefore, the court <b>imposes upon him</b> the responsibility to pay his share for <b>all</b> of the partitions, because his actions demonstrate that he wants the partition between their fields. <b>But</b> if the owner of the <b>surrounding</b> field <b>arose</b> and built a partition on the fourth side of the field, the owner of the surrounded field <b>must give him only</b> his share of <b>the value of</b> the partition of the <b>fourth</b> side.
<b>And Rabbi Yosei maintains</b> that it is <b>no different</b> if it was the owner of the <b>surrounded</b> field who arose and built a partition on the fourth side, <b>and</b> it is <b>no different</b> if it was the owner of the <b>surrounding</b> field who arose and built a partition on the fourth side. <b>If</b> either one <b>arose and built a partition</b> on the fourth side, the court <b>imposes upon</b> the owner of the inner field the obligation to pay his share for <b>all</b> of the partitions.
The Gemara reports <b>another version</b> of this last answer: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to the issue of whether the partition on the fourth side was built by the owner of the <b>surrounding</b> field <b>or</b> by the owner of the <b>surrounded</b> field. <b>The first <i>tanna</i> maintains</b> that even <b>if</b> the owner of the <b>surrounding</b> field <b>built a partition</b> on <b>the fourth</b> side, the owner of the surrounded field <b>also gives him</b> his share of the cost of the partitions. <b>And Rabbi Yosei maintains</b> that only <b>if</b> the owner of the <b>surrounded</b> field <b>arose</b> and <b>built a partition</b> on <b>the fourth</b> side <b>does he give</b> the owner of the surrounding field his share of the cost of the partitions. Why is that? <b>Because he reveals that he is pleased</b> with the partitions. <b>But if</b> the owner of the <b>surrounding</b> field <b>built a partition</b> on the fourth side, the owner of the surrounded field <b>does not give him anything,</b> as he can continue to claim that he has no interest in the partitions.

Daf 5a

It is related that a man named <b>Ronya</b> had a field that <b>was surrounded by</b> fields belonging to <b>Ravina on</b> all <b>four sides.</b> Ravina built partitions around his fields and <b>said to him: Give me</b> your share of the expense <b>in accordance with what I</b> actually spent when I <b>built the partitions,</b> i.e., half the cost of the partitions. Ronya <b>did not give</b> it <b>to him.</b> Ravina said to him: <b>Give me</b> then at least your share of the expense <b>in accordance with a reduced</b> assessment of the <b>price of reeds.</b> Ronya <b>did not give</b> it <b>to him.</b> Ravina said to him: <b>Give me</b> then at least <b>the wage of a watchman.</b> But <b>he did not give</b> even this <b>to him.</b>
<b>One day,</b> Ronya <b>was harvesting dates.</b> Ravina <b>said to his sharecropper: Go take a cluster [<i>kibbura</i>] of dates from him.</b> The sharecropper <b>went to bring them,</b> but Ronya <b>raised his voice at him</b> in protest, whereupon Ravina <b>said to him: You have revealed that you are pleased</b> with the partitions and the protection that they provide you. Even <b>if it were only a goat</b> that entered your field, <b>wouldn’t</b> the field <b>need safeguarding,</b> to prevent the goat from eating the dates? Ronya <b>said to him:</b> If it were <b>only a goat, doesn’t</b> one <b>need</b> merely <b>to chase it away [<i>le’akhluyei</i>]?</b> No partition is required. Ravina <b>said to him: But wouldn’t you need a man to chase</b> the goat <b>away?</b> Pay me then at least the wage of a watchman.
Ravina <b>came before Rava</b> to adjudicate the matter. Rava <b>said to</b> Ronya: <b>Go appease</b> Ravina <b>with what he</b> expressed his willingness to be <b>appeased with,</b> namely, the wage of a watchman. <b>And if not, I will judge you in accordance with</b> the ruling of <b>Rav Huna in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> and you will be required to pay half the cost of the partition based on what Ravina actually spent on it.
Incidental to that episode, the Gemara relates another encounter between Ravina and Ronya. <b>Ronya</b> once <b>bought land adjoining</b> property belonging to <b>Ravina. Ravina considered removing him due to the <i>halakha</i> of one</b> whose field <b>borders</b> the field of his neighbor. When land is up for sale, the owners of the adjoining fields have the right of first refusal. If one of the neighbors is willing to match the highest price being offered to the seller, that neighbor has the preemptive right to purchase the property, and if somebody else buys it, that buyer can be removed. Since Ravina owned the adjacent property, he thought that he enjoyed the right of first refusal. <b>Rav Safra, son of Rav Yeiva, said to Ravina: People say: Four</b> dinars <b>for a large hide [<i>tzalla</i>], four for a small hide [<i>tzelala</i>].</b> Since Ronya also owned land bordering the desired parcel, you cannot remove him even though his plot of land is smaller than yours.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a dividing <b>wall</b> in a jointly owned <b>courtyard that fell,</b> if one of the owners wishes to rebuild the wall, the court <b>obligates</b> the other owner <b>to build</b> the wall with him <b>up to</b> a height of <b>four cubits.</b> If after the wall was built one of the neighbors claims he alone constructed it and the other did not participate in its building, the latter is nevertheless <b>presumed to have given</b> his share of the money, <b>unless</b> the claimant <b>brings proof that</b> the other <b>did not give</b> his part.
The court <b>does not obligate</b> the reluctant neighbor to contribute to the building of the wall <b>higher than four cubits.</b> But if the reluctant neighbor <b>built another wall close</b> to the wall that had been built higher than four cubits, in order to set a roof over the room that was thereby created, the court <b>imposes upon him</b> the responsibility to pay his share for <b>all</b> of the rebuilt wall, <b>even though he has not</b> yet <b>set a roof over it.</b> Since he has demonstrated his desire to make use of what his neighbor built, he must participate in the cost of its construction. If the builder of the first wall later claims that he did not receive payment from his neighbor, the neighbor <b>is presumed not to have given</b> his share of the money, <b>unless he brings proof that he did</b> in fact <b>give</b> money for the building of the wall.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> If a lender <b>set a time for another</b> to repay the loan that he had extended to him <b>and</b> when the debt came due the borrower <b>said to</b> the lender: <b>I</b> already <b>repaid you within the time, he is not deemed credible,</b> as people do not ordinarily repay their debts before they are due. The lender would be happy <b>if</b> the borrower <b>would only repay</b> his debt <b>on time. Abaye and Rava</b> disagree with Reish Lakish, <b>as they both say: A person is apt to repay</b> his debt <b>within its time,</b> i.e., before it is due. This is because <b>sometimes he happens to have money</b> and the borrower <b>says</b> to himself: <b>I will go</b> and <b>repay</b> my debt

Daf 5b

<b>so that he will not trouble me</b> later by constantly demanding the money.
The Gemara attempts to bring a proof in support of the opinion of Abaye and Rava from what <b>we learned</b> in the mishna (5a): If after the wall was built one of the neighbors claims he alone constructed it and the other did not participate in its building, the latter is nevertheless <b>presumed to have given</b> his share of the money, <b>unless</b> the claimant <b>brings proof that</b> the other <b>did not give</b> his part.
The Gemara clarifies the matter: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case under discussion? <b>If we say</b> that <b>he said to him: I paid you at the time</b> when the payment became due, when the wall was completed, it is <b>obvious</b> that <b>he is presumed to have given</b> his part. <b>Rather, is it not that he said to him: I paid you within the time</b> before the payment became due, while the wall was still under construction? And with regard to such a case the mishna states that he is presumed to have given his share. <b>Apparently, a person is apt to repay</b> his debt <b>within its time,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Abaye and Rava. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Here</b> it <b>is different, because the time</b> to pay is upon the completion of <b>each and every row.</b> Payment does not become due specifically at the completion of the entire wall.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof in support of the opinion of Reish Lakish from the continuation of the mishna (5a): The court does not obligate the reluctant neighbor to contribute to the building of the wall higher than four cubits. But if the reluctant neighbor built another wall close to the wall that had been built higher than four cubits, in order to set a roof over the room that was thereby created, the court imposes upon him the responsibility to pay his share for all of the rebuilt wall, even though he has not yet set a roof over it. If the builder of the first wall later claims he did not receive payment from his neighbor, the neighbor <b>is presumed not to have given</b> his share of the money, <b>unless he brings proof that he did</b> in fact <b>give</b> money for the building of the wall.
The Gemara clarifies the matter: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case under discussion? <b>If we say</b> that <b>he said to him: I paid you at the time</b> that the payment became due, when the wall was completed, <b>why</b> is he <b>not</b> deemed credible? <b>Rather,</b> is it <b>not that he said to him: I paid you within the time</b> before the payment became due, and therefore he is not deemed credible? <b>Apparently, a person is not apt to repay</b> his debt <b>within its time,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Reish Lakish. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Here</b> it <b>is different, since</b> the reluctant neighbor <b>says: Who says that the Rabbis will obligate me</b> to pay for this wall? In such a case he certainly does not pay before the payment becomes due.
<b>Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, acted</b> in such a case <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye and Rava. Mar bar Rav Ashi acted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> that one is not deemed credible when he says that he repaid a loan before it became due. <b>And</b> if the debtor dies, the court collects payment <b>even from</b> his <b>orphans</b> based on this assumption. <b>And even though the Master said</b> that <b>one who comes to collect</b> money <b>from the property of orphans cannot collect unless</b> he first takes <b>an oath</b> that he did not already collect the debt from the deceased, here he can collect without taking an oath because there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>a person is not apt to repay</b> his debt <b>within its time.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if the lender stipulated a time with the borrower for repayment of the debt, and <b>he demanded</b> payment of the money <b>after the time</b> that the payment became due had passed, <b>and</b> the borrower <b>said to him: I</b> already <b>repaid you within the time</b> before the payment became due? <b>Do we say</b> that even <b>where there is a presumption</b> against someone’s claim, as in this case where there is a presumption that people do not pay their debts before they become due, <b>we say</b> that the borrower can claim: <b>Why would I lie?</b> If one of the litigants could have advanced a claim more advantageous to his cause than the one he actually did, the assumption is that he is telling the truth. Consequently, in this case had the borrower wished to lie, he could have said that he repaid his debt when it became due, and he would have been deemed credible. Therefore, when he claims that he repaid it before it came due he should also be deemed credible.

Daf 6a

<b>Or perhaps where there is a presumption</b> against a person’s claim, <b>we do not say</b> that the borrower can claim: <b>Why would I lie?</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: If after the wall was built one of the neighbors claims he alone constructed it and the other did not participate in its building, the latter is nevertheless <b>presumed to have given</b> his share of the money, <b>unless</b> the claimant <b>brings proof that</b> the other <b>did not give</b> his share.
The Gemara clarifies the matter: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case? <b>If we say that</b> one partner <b>demanded</b> that the other party pay the money <b>after the time</b> that the payment became due, i.e., after the wall was rebuilt, <b>and</b> the other partner <b>said to him: I paid you at the time</b> that the payment became due, it is <b>obvious</b> that he is presumed to have given him the money. <b>Rather, is it not</b> a case <b>where he said to him: I paid you within the time,</b> i.e., before the payment became due? <b>Apparently, even where there is a presumption</b> against a person’s claim, <b>we say</b> that the defendant can claim: <b>Why would I lie?</b> The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Here</b> it <b>is different, because the time</b> to pay is upon the completion of <b>each and every row.</b> Therefore, it is as if he said: I paid you at the time that the payment became due.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from the continuation of the mishna. The court <b>does not obligate</b> the reluctant neighbor to contribute to the building of the part of the wall that is <b>above four cubits.</b> But if the reluctant neighbor <b>built another wall close to</b> the wall that was built higher than four cubits, in order to set a roof over the room that was thereby created, the court imposes upon him the responsibility to pay his share for all of the rebuilt wall, even though he has not yet set a roof over it. If the builder of the first wall later claims that he did not receive payment from his neighbor, the neighbor is presumed not to have given his share of the money, <b>unless he brings proof that he did</b> in fact <b>give</b> money for the building of the wall.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case? <b>If we say that</b> one partner <b>demanded</b> that the other party pay the money <b>after the time</b> that the payment became due, <b>and he,</b> the latter, <b>said to him: I paid you at the time</b> that the payment became due, <b>why</b> is he <b>not</b> deemed credible? <b>Rather, is it not that he said: I paid you within the time,</b> before the payment became due? And with regard to this case, the mishna states that he is not deemed credible. <b>Apparently, where there is a presumption</b> against a person’s claim, <b>we do not say</b> that the defendant can claim: <b>Why would I lie?</b> The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Here</b> it <b>is different, since</b> the reluctant neighbor <b>says: Who says that the Rabbis will obligate me</b> to pay for this additional part of the wall? In such a case he certainly does not pay before the payment becomes due. The mishna does not provide a proof one way or the other.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from what is taught in a mishna (<i>Shevuot</i> 38b): If one said to another: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession,</b> and the other one <b>said to him</b> in the presence of witnesses: <b>Yes,</b> that is so; and <b>the next day</b> the lender <b>said to</b> the borrower: <b>Give me</b> the money that you owe me, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: <b>If</b> the borrower <b>said: I</b> already <b>gave it to you,</b> he is <b>exempt.</b> But if he said: <b>Nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>liable.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the matter: <b>What, is it not</b> that when he says: <b>I</b> already <b>gave it to you, he is saying to him: I repaid you at the time</b> that the payment became due; and when he says: <b>Nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession, he is saying to him: I repaid you within the time,</b> before the payment became due? <b>And</b> yet, the mishna <b>teaches</b> with regard to the latter case that he is <b>liable. Apparently, where there is a presumption</b> against a person’s claim, <b>we do not say</b> that the borrower can claim: <b>Why would I lie?</b> The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No, what</b> does he mean when he says: <b>Nothing</b> of <b>yours</b> is <b>in my possession?</b> He is saying: <b>There were never such matters;</b> i.e., the purported loan never occurred. <b>As the Master says: Anyone who says: I did not borrow, is</b> treated <b>as one who says: I did not repay,</b> and since it is known by his own admission that he borrowed money, he is liable to pay.
§ The mishna teaches: But if the reluctant neighbor <b>built another wall close to</b> the wall that was built higher than four cubits, in order to set a roof over the room that was thereby created, the court <b>imposes upon him</b> the responsibility to pay his share for <b>all</b> of the rebuilt wall. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If <b>he built</b> another wall <b>close to</b> the first wall that was <b>half</b> the length or the height of the wall that was built higher than four cubits, it is as if <b>he built</b> it <b>close to</b> the height and length of <b>the entire</b> wall. Since he can easily add to his wall so that it will be equal in length or height to the wall the neighbor rebuilt, he must therefore pay half the cost of the entire rebuilt wall. <b>And Rav Naḥman says:</b> With regard to <b>that which he built close, he built</b> it <b>close;</b> with regard to <b>that which he did not build close, he did not</b> yet <b>build</b> it <b>close.</b> Accordingly, he is required to pay an additional share only for the part of the wall corresponding to the new wall he built.
<b>And Rav Huna concedes with regard to an attachment to the corner</b> of his house that he is not required to pay half the cost of the entire rebuilt wall. If he built the extension of his house in this manner, it is not considered as if he built it close to the entire wall, as it is unlikely that he will add to it. <b>And Rav Naḥman concedes</b> that <b>in</b> a case in which he places a heavy <b>beam [<i>be’afriza</i>]</b> on the wall that can support a roof, <b>or</b> carves into the wall <b>indentations to fix beams in place,</b> then even if he has not yet made use of the entire height of the wall, he has demonstrated his desire to do so in the future, and therefore he must pay half the cost of the entire wall.
§ The mishna teaches that if the builder of the first wall later claims that he did not receive payment from his neighbor, the neighbor is presumed not to have given his share of the money, unless he brings proof that he did in fact give money for the building of the wall. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> Even if <b>openings in the wall</b> were built on the side facing the reluctant partner and these openings are suited to serve as beam rests, this does <b>not</b> create <b>a presumption</b> that the reluctant partner contributed his share to the building of the wall. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if</b> the builder of the wall <b>made sills</b> for these openings. As the builder of the wall can <b>say to</b> his neighbor: <b>I said</b> to myself that <b>when you will appease me</b> and pay me for the construction of the wall, you might want to attach beams to it, and I do <b>not</b> want <b>the foundations of my wall to be damaged</b> by your fashioning new openings in it. Therefore, from the outset, I built the wall with these openings.
With regard to the use of a neighbor’s wall, <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If one <b>acquired the privilege to</b> place <b>thin beams</b> on his neighbor’s wall, i.e., if one had used the wall in that manner in the past and the owner did not protest, so the one using it can maintain that he had acquired from the owner the right to do so, <b>he has not acquired the privilege to</b> place <b>thick beams</b> there. But if he acquired the privilege <b>to</b> place <b>thick beams</b> on the wall, <b>he has acquired the privilege to</b> place <b>thin beams</b> there. <b>Rav Yosef says:</b> If <b>he acquired the privilege to</b> place <b>thin beams, he</b> also <b>has acquired the privilege to</b> place <b>thick beams.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If one <b>acquired the privilege to</b> place <b>thin beams</b> on his neighbor’s wall, <b>he has acquired the privilege to</b> place <b>thick beams</b> there; and if he acquired the privilege <b>to</b> place <b>thick beams, he has acquired the privilege to</b> place <b>thin beams.</b> This version of Rav Naḥman’s statement accords with the statement of Rav Yosef.
With regard to a similar matter, <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If one <b>acquired the privilege to</b> let <b>water drip</b> from his roof into his neighbor’s courtyard, <b>he has acquired the privilege to</b> let the <b>water pour</b> there though a drainpipe. If the neighbor did not protest about the water dripping from the roof into his courtyard, he would certainly allow him to build a drainpipe, which would limit the water to a single place. But if <b>he acquired the privilege to</b> let the <b>water pour</b> through a drainpipe into his neighbor’s courtyard, <b>he has not acquired the privilege</b> to let <b>water drip</b> there from his roof. <b>And Rav Yosef says: Even</b> if <b>he acquired the privilege to</b> let <b>water pour</b> there through a drainpipe, <b>he</b> also <b>has acquired the privilege to</b> let <b>water drip</b> there from his roof.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> If one <b>acquired the privilege to</b> let <b>water pour</b> through a drainpipe into his neighbor’s courtyard, <b>he has acquired the privilege to</b> let <b>water drip</b> there from his roof; and <b>if he acquired the privilege to</b> let <b>water drip</b> from his roof into his neighbor’s courtyard, <b>he has acquired the privilege to</b> let <b>water pour</b> there through a drainpipe. <b>But</b> he has <b>not</b> acquired the privilege <b>to</b> let water drip from <b>a hut</b> whose roof is composed <b>of willow branches</b> into his neighbor’s courtyard. <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> He has acquired the privilege to let water drip there <b>even</b> from <b>a hut</b> whose roof is composed <b>of willow branches.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Rav Yosef performed an action,</b> i.e., issued a practical ruling, <b>with regard to a hut</b> whose roof is composed <b>of willow branches,</b> allowing the neighbor to let water drip from there after he had acquired the privilege to use a drainpipe.
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> If <b>one rents a room to another</b>

Daf 6b

<b>in a large building</b> with many residences, the renter <b>may make use of the</b> building’s <b>projections and of the</b> cavities in its external <b>walls up to</b> a distance of <b>four cubits</b> from his room, <b>and</b> he may make use <b>of the thickness of the wall in a place where it is customary</b> to do so. <b>But</b> as for making use <b>of the building’s</b> front <b>garden [<i>betarbatz</i>],</b> he may <b>not</b> do so. <b>And Rav Naḥman himself said:</b> He may make use <b>of even the building’s</b> front <b>garden. But</b> he may <b>not</b> use <b>the yard that is at the back of the house. And Rava said:</b> He may use <b>even the yard that is at the back of the house.</b>
Apropos the use of a wall between neighbors, <b>Ravina says:</b> If one’s <b>beam</b> supporting a covering <b>for shade</b> was resting on his neighbor’s wall <b>for up to thirty days, there is no acquired privilege</b> for him to continue using it, since the neighbor can claim that he had assumed that the beam was there only temporarily and for that reason he did not protest. But <b>after thirty days, there is an acquired privilege. And if it was</b> for <b>a <i>sukka</i></b> that was being used <b>for the mitzva</b> on the festival of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>for up to seven days there is no acquired privilege</b> for him to continue using it, since it is assumed that it is there for the mitzva and that after the Festival it will be removed. But if <b>after seven days</b> the neighbor did not protest, <b>there is an acquired privilege</b> for him to continue using it. <b>And if</b> the one using the beam <b>attached it with clay, there is immediately</b> such <b>an acquired privilege.</b>
§ <b>Abaye says:</b> If there were <b>two houses on two sides of a public domain, this</b> one, the owner of one of the houses, must <b>build a fence for half his roof, and that</b> one, the owner of the other house, must <b>build a fence for half his roof.</b> They must position the fences so that <b>one</b> fence <b>is not opposite the other</b> fence, <b>and</b> each one must <b>add</b> to his fence a little beyond the midway point, so that each one should not be able to see the activity on the other’s roof.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> discuss <b>specifically</b> the case of two houses on opposite sides of <b>a public domain,</b> considering that the same <i>halakha</i> should apply <b>even</b> if the two houses are separated by <b>a private domain?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for</b> Abaye to mention <b>a public domain, lest you say</b> that one neighbor can <b>say</b> to the other: <b>Ultimately, you need to conceal</b> yourself <b>from people in the public domain.</b> Since in any event you have to build a fence across your entire roof, you cannot compel me to build a fence on my roof.
To counter this, Abaye <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so, because the second homeowner <b>can say to</b> the first in response: <b>The public can see me</b> only <b>during the day,</b> when pedestrians pass by, <b>but they cannot see me at night. You,</b> by contrast, <b>can see me both during the day and at night. Alternatively,</b> he can say: <b>The public can see me</b> from the street only <b>when I am standing,</b> but <b>they cannot see me when I am sitting. You,</b> by contrast, <b>can see me both when I am standing and when I am sitting.</b> And furthermore, <b>the public can see me</b> only <b>when they look</b> specifically at me, <b>but they cannot see me when they do not look</b> specifically at me, since the average pedestrian does not look up to see what is happening on the roofs. <b>You,</b> by contrast, <b>can see me in any case,</b> because you live opposite me.
<b>The Master,</b> i.e., Abaye, <b>said</b> above: <b>This</b> one, the owner of one of the houses, must <b>build a fence for half his roof, and that</b> one, the owner of the other house, must <b>build a fence for half his roof.</b> They must position the fences so that <b>one</b> fence <b>is not opposite the other</b> fence, <b>and</b> each one must <b>add</b> to his fence a little beyond the midway point. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that each one must make a fence for half his roof?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case where <b>one of them went ahead</b> on his own and <b>constructed</b> a fence on half his roof, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>the other can say to him: Take</b> from me compensation for <b>the expenditure [<i>uzinka</i>], and you build the entire</b> fence, and in that way we will not invade one another’s privacy. Therefore, Abaye <b>teaches us</b> that the neighbor who built the fence for half his roof <b>can say to him: What is the reason you do not</b> want to <b>build</b> a fence? It is <b>because</b> the added weight <b>will damage your house’s foundation. My foundation too will be damaged</b> if I continue to build on my roof.
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If one’s <b>roof is adjacent to his neighbor’s courtyard, he must build a fence</b> on the roof <b>four cubits high,</b> so that he will not be able to see into his neighbor’s courtyard, <b>but</b> he is <b>not</b> required to build a fence <b>between</b> one <b>roof and</b> another <b>roof. And Rav Naḥman him-self says: He is not required to</b> build a fence <b>four cubits</b> high on the roof, <b>but he is required to</b> build <b>a partition</b> that is <b>ten</b> handbreadths high.
The Gemara asks: <b>For what</b> purpose, according to Rav Naḥman, does the neighbor have to build such a partition? <b>If</b> it is <b>to</b> prevent <b>damage</b> caused by exposure to the <b>sight</b> of others, <b>we require</b> a partition of <b>four cubits. If</b> it is <b>to catch</b> the neighbor <b>as a thief,</b> i.e., to set a boundary between the two properties so that any trespass will be construed as attempted theft, <b>a mere partition of pegs suffices.</b> And <b>if</b> it is to prevent <b>kid goats and lambs</b> from crossing from one roof to the other, a low partition that is high <b>enough so that</b> the goat or lamb <b>will not</b> be able to <b>leap headlong</b> from one roof to the other <b>suffices.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> it is built <b>to catch</b> the neighbor <b>as a thief. With a partition of pegs he can give an excuse and say</b> that <b>he was</b> merely <b>stretching himself,</b> but <b>with a partition of ten</b> handbreadths <b>he cannot give</b> such <b>an excuse.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav Naḥman from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If his courtyard was higher than the other’s roof, he is not required to attend to it. What, is it not</b> teaching <b>that he is not required to attend to it at all,</b> i.e., that he need not build any type of fence? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it means that <b>he is not required to attend</b> to building a partition <b>of four cubits, but he must attend to</b> building <b>a partition of ten</b> handbreadths, as maintained by Rav Naḥman.
<b>It was stated</b> that <i>amora’im</i> disagree about the following case: If there are <b>two</b> adjoining <b>courtyards, one higher than the other, Rav Huna says</b> that the owner of <b>the lower</b> courtyard <b>builds</b> the wall separating the courtyards <b>from his level and upward, and</b> the owner of <b>the upper</b> courtyard <b>builds</b> the wall <b>from his level and upward. And Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The owner of <b>the upper</b> courtyard <b>assists</b> the owner of the lower courtyard <b>and builds from below,</b> even including that part of the wall which is opposite the lower courtyard.
The Gemara notes that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda:</b> If there were <b>two</b> adjoining <b>courtyards, one higher than the other,</b> the owner of <b>the upper</b> courtyard <b>cannot say: I will build from my level and upward, but</b> rather <b>he assists</b> the owner of the lower courtyard <b>and builds from below. And if his courtyard is higher than the roof of his neighbor, he is not required to attend to it.</b> The owner of the upper courtyard need not build a partition because people do not ordinarily use their roofs.
§ It is related that <b>two</b> people <b>were living</b> in a two-story building; <b>one was living in the upper</b> story, <b>and one was living in the lower</b> one. <b>The lower</b> story began to <b>collapse,</b> its walls sinking into the ground to the point that it was no longer fit for dwelling. The owner of <b>the lower</b> story <b>said to</b> the owner of <b>the upper</b> story: <b>Come and let us</b> demolish the whole building and <b>rebuild it</b> together. The owner of the upper story <b>said to him: I am living comfortably</b> and am under no obligation to rebuild your residence.

Daf 7a

The owner of the lower story <b>said to him: I will dismantle</b> the structure <b>and rebuild it.</b> The owner of the upper story <b>said:</b> But then <b>I</b> will <b>have no place to live</b> while you are renovating. The owner of the lower story <b>said to him: I will rent a place for you</b> to live for the duration. The owner of the upper story <b>said to him: I do not</b> want <b>to bother</b> with moving. The owner of the lower story said to him: But <b>I cannot live</b> in my apartment in this condition, as the walls have sunk into the ground. The owner of the upper story said to him: That is not my problem. <b>Crawl on your stomach to go in, and crawl on your stomach to go out.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥama said: By law,</b> the owner of the upper story <b>can prevent</b> his downstairs neighbor from rebuilding. The Gemara comments: <b>And this statement</b> applies <b>only when the beams</b> supporting the second story <b>have not reached lower than ten</b> handbreadths from the ground. <b>But if</b> those <b>beams have reached lower than ten</b> handbreadths from the ground, the owner of the lower story <b>can say to</b> the owner of the upper story: <b>Below ten</b> handbreadths <b>is my domain and</b> my domain <b>is not bound to you</b> to support your residence.
The Gemara further comments: <b>And this statement,</b> that the owner of the upper story can prevent his downstairs neighbor from rebuilding, applies <b>only</b> when <b>they did not stipulate with each other</b> that if the house sinks they will rebuild the house anew. <b>But if they made</b> such <b>a stipulation with each other, they must dismantle</b> the house <b>and rebuild it.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And if they made</b> such <b>a stipulation with each other, to what extent</b> must the ceiling of the lower story drop before they implement the stipulation? <b>The Sages said before Rabba in the name of Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, who said in the name of Rav Naḥman: Like that which we learned</b> in a mishna (98b): If one takes upon himself to build a house for another person, without stipulating its dimensions, <b>its height</b> must be equal to the sum of <b>half its length and half its width. Rabba said to them: Did I not tell you not to hang empty pitchers on Rav Naḥman,</b> meaning not to attribute foolish opinions to him? Rather, <b>this is what Rav Naḥman said: As people normally live,</b> and no more. <b>And how much</b> space is that? <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> The ceiling of the lower story must be high enough <b>so that one could bring in bundles</b> of reeds <b>of</b> the type made in <b>Meḥoza and</b> be able to <b>turn around.</b>
It is further related that <b>a certain man built a wall outside the windows of his neighbor.</b> The neighbor <b>said to him: You are</b> blocking the light with your wall and <b>darkening my</b> house. The one who built the wall <b>said to him: I will seal</b> your windows <b>here and make</b> new <b>windows for you</b> in your wall <b>above the wall</b> that I am building. The neighbor <b>said to him:</b> By doing so <b>you will damage my wall.</b> The one who built the wall <b>said to him: I will demolish your wall until the level of the windows and rebuild it, and</b> then <b>I will make windows for you in</b> the new part of <b>the building above my wall.</b> The neighbor <b>said to him: A wall that is old at the bottom and new at the top will not endure.</b>
The one who built the wall <b>said to him: I will demolish</b> the wall <b>until the ground and</b> entirely <b>rebuild it, and</b> then <b>I will make windows for you in it</b> above my wall. The neighbor <b>said to him: One new wall in an old house will not endure.</b> The one who built the wall <b>said to him: I will demolish your entire house and put windows in the</b> new <b>building</b> that I will erect in its place. The neighbor <b>said to him:</b> But in the meantime <b>I will have no place to live.</b> The one who built the wall <b>said to him: I will rent a place for you</b> to live. The neighbor <b>said to him: I do not</b> want <b>to bother</b> with moving. <b>Rav Ḥama said: By law,</b> the neighbor <b>can prevent</b> him from building the wall.
The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> case <b>is</b> identical to <b>that</b> case; this case is very similar to the previous case of the owner of the upper story who can prevent the owner of the lower story from rebuilding. <b>Why do I</b> need <b>this additional</b> case? The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us that even if he uses</b> the house <b>only for</b> storing <b>straw and wood,</b> he can still maintain that blocking the light causes him damage and can prevent the neighbor from erecting the wall.
The Gemara further relates: <b>There were two brothers who divided</b> their father’s estate <b>between them. One received a hall [<i>aspelida</i>]</b> in his share <b>and one received a garden. The one who received the garden went and built a wall in front of the opening of the hall.</b> His brother <b>said to him: You are</b> blocking the light with your wall and <b>darkening my</b> house. The one who received the garden <b>said to him: I am building on my</b> property. <b>Rav Ḥama said: By right he said</b> that <b>to him,</b> as it is permitted for him to build there.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this <b>different from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>two brothers divided</b> their father’s estate between them, <b>one of them taking a vineyard and</b> the other <b>one taking a grain field, the owner of the vineyard has</b> the right to an area <b>four cubits</b> wide <b>in the grain field</b> for the purpose of working the vineyard, <b>since it was on that condition</b> that <b>they divided</b> the estate. Why in this case does the owner of the hall not have the right to make use of the light coming in from the garden?
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: There,</b> the reason is that <b>they made an assessment with each other</b> with regard to the value of the fields, arranging for compensation if one received more than the other, and they took the work area into account. Ravina asked: <b>But what</b> did they do <b>here? Did they not make an assessment with each other? Are we dealing with fools, that this one took the</b> valuable <b>hall and the</b> other <b>one took</b> the much less valuable <b>garden without making an assessment with each other? Rav Ashi said to him: Although they assessed with each other the value of the bricks, the beams, and the boards, they did not assess with each other the value of the airspace.</b> With regard to that, each one retained full rights to his respective airspace.
The Gemara says: <b>And let</b> the one who received the hall <b>say to</b> the other: <b>Initially, you gave me</b> a well-lit <b>hall; now you are making it</b> into <b>a small</b> dark <b>room [<i>idrona</i>]. Rav Shimi bar Ashi said: He gave him only</b> a place that is called a hall <b>by name,</b> that is, a place that is called a hall even though it is no longer used that way.
Rav Ashi continues: <b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who says</b> to another: <b>I am selling you a <i>beit kor</i> of dirt, it becomes his even if it is only a <i>letekh</i>,</b> i.e., a half-<i>kor</i>, and the sale is not void, <b>because he sold him only</b> a place that is called a <i>beit kor</i> <b>by name.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And this</b> ruling applies only as long as the land he is selling him <b>is</b> actually <b>called a <i>beit kor</i>.</b> Similarly, if he says to him: <b>I am selling you an orchard, it becomes his even if it lacks pomegranates, because he sold him only</b> a place that is called an orchard <b>by name.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And this</b> applies only as long as the land he is selling <b>is</b> actually <b>called an orchard.</b> And similarly, if he says to him: <b>I am selling you a vineyard, it becomes his even if it lacks grapevines, because he sold him only</b> a place that is called a vineyard <b>by name.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And this</b> applies only as long as the land he is selling <b>is</b> actually <b>called a vineyard.</b>
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>Are these</b> cases <b>comparable? There, the seller can say to the buyer: I sold you</b> only a place that is called that <b>by name; here,</b> the one who received the hall <b>can say to</b> his brother: <b>I took</b> this portion <b>as my share on condition that I would live there the way our fathers lived</b> there, and that you would not change that by blocking the light entering through the windows.
With regard to Rav Ḥama’s ruling that it is permitted for the brother who received the garden to build a wall in front of the hall, <b>they said to him,</b>

Daf 7b

i.e., <b>Mar Yenuka and Mar Kashisha, sons of Rav Ḥisda,</b> said to <b>Rav Ashi: The</b> Sages <b>of Neharde’a</b> follow <b>their</b> usual line of <b>reasoning,</b> as Rav Ḥama, who was from Neharde’a, issued his ruling in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel, who was also from that city. <b>As Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> In the case of <b>brothers who divided</b> their father’s estate, <b>they do not have</b> a right-of-<b>way against each other.</b> Although the father would traverse the outer field from the inner field to access the public domain, the brother who received the inner field as an inheritance does not have the right to traverse his brother’s outer field.
Shmuel continues: <b>Nor</b> do they have the right of <b>windows against each other,</b> i.e., the right to prevent the other from building a wall facing his windows; <b>nor</b> do they have the right of <b>ladders against each other,</b> i.e., the right to set up a ladder in the other’s property in order to get to his own; <b>nor</b> do they have the right of <b>a water channel against each other,</b> i.e., the right to pass a water channel through the other’s property. <b>And be careful with these, since they are established <i>halakhot</i>. Rava says:</b> The brothers <b>do have</b> all of the aforementioned rights. Rav Ḥama agrees with Shmuel’s opinion, that each brother can do as he pleases on his own property without the other one preventing him from doing so.
Since Rav Ḥama’s rulings were mentioned, the Gemara cites another halakhic ruling in his name. There was <b>a certain promissory note</b> inherited <b>by orphans</b> from their father, stating that somebody owed them money, <b>against which a receipt was produced</b> by the borrower, stating that the debt was already paid. <b>Rav Ḥama said: We cannot</b> use the note to <b>collect</b> the debt on behalf of the orphans, <b>nor can we tear it up.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>We cannot collect</b> with the note because <b>a receipt against it was produced</b> by the borrower; and <b>we cannot tear</b> the note <b>up because perhaps when the orphans grow up they will bring proof</b> that the receipt was forged <b>and undermine it.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Ravina: What</b> is <b>the <i>halakha</i>?</b> Ravina <b>said to him: In all</b> the cases in this discussion, <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥama, except for</b> the case of <b>the receipt, because we do not presume that the witnesses are liars.</b> Since witnesses signed the receipt, the court trusts that the debt was paid and they tear up the promissory note.
<b>Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari, said: In this</b> case <b>as well, the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥama,</b> because the validity of the receipt is in doubt. <b>As, if it is so</b> that <b>it</b> is <b>a valid receipt,</b> the borrower <b>should have produced it during their father’s lifetime. And since he did not produce it</b> at the proper time, <b>we learn from this that he</b> may have <b>forged it.</b> Even though this is not an absolute proof, it is sufficient reason not to tear up the promissory note.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The residents of a courtyard <b>can compel</b> each inhabitant of that courtyard <b>to</b> financially participate in the <b>building of a gatehouse and a door to the</b> jointly owned <b>courtyard. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> disagrees and <b>says: Not all courtyards require a gatehouse,</b> and each courtyard must be considered on its own in accordance with its specific needs. Similarly, the residents of a city <b>can compel</b> each inhabitant of that city <b>to</b> contribute to the <b>building of a wall, double doors, and a crossbar for the city. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> disagrees and <b>says: Not all towns require a wall.</b>
With regard to this latter obligation, the mishna asks: <b>How long</b> must one live <b>in the city to be</b> considered <b>like</b> one of <b>the people of the city</b> and therefore obligated to contribute to these expenses? <b>Twelve months.</b> But if he <b>bought</b> himself <b>a residence in</b> the city, <b>he is immediately</b> considered <b>like</b> one of <b>the people of the city.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> making <b>a gatehouse is beneficial? But</b> wasn’t there <b>that pious man, with whom</b> the prophet <b>Elijah was accustomed to speak,</b> who <b>built a gatehouse, and</b> after-ward Elijah <b>did not speak with him again?</b> The objection to the building of a gatehouse is that the guard who mans it prevents the poor from entering and asking for charity. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult: This,</b> the case presented in the mishna, is referring to a gatehouse built <b>on the inside</b> of the courtyard, in which case the poor can at least reach the courtyard’s entrance and be heard inside the courtyard; <b>that,</b> the story of the pious man and Elijah, involves a gatehouse that was built <b>on the outside</b> of the courtyard, completely blocking the poor’s access to the courtyard’s entrance.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that in <b>both</b> cases the gatehouse was built <b>outside</b> the courtyard, <b>and</b> yet this is <b>not difficult:</b> In the one case, <b>there is a door</b> to the gatehouse, so that the poor cannot be heard inside the courtyard, while in the other case <b>there is no door. Or if you wish, say</b> that in <b>both</b> cases <b>there is a door, and</b> still this is <b>not difficult:</b> In the one case, <b>there is a key</b> needed to open the door, and the key is not available to the poor people, whereas in the other case, <b>there is no key</b> needed. <b>Or if you wish, say</b> that in <b>both</b> cases <b>there is a key</b> needed, <b>and</b> even so this is <b>not difficult:</b> In the one case <b>the key is on the inside,</b> so that the poor cannot reach it, while in the other case of the mishna, <b>the key is on the outside.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that the residents of a courtyard <b>can compel</b> each inhabitant of that courtyard <b>to</b> financially participate in the <b>building of a gatehouse and a door to the</b> jointly owned <b>courtyard. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not all courtyards require a gatehouse. Rather, a courtyard that adjoins the public domain requires a gatehouse</b> to prevent people from peering in. <b>But</b> a courtyard <b>that does not adjoin the public domain does not require a gatehouse.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why don’t <b>the Rabbis</b> make this distinction? The Gemara answers: Even if a courtyard does not adjoin the public domain, <b>people in the public domain sometimes are forced</b> toward the courtyard due to crowding in the public domain, <b>and come and enter</b> the courtyard.
§ The mishna teaches that the residents of a city <b>can compel</b> each inhabitant of that city <b>to</b> contribute to the <b>building</b> of a wall, double doors, and a crossbar <b>for the city. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The residents of a city <b>can compel</b> each inhabitant of that city <b>to build double doors and a crossbar for the city. And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Not all cities require a wall. Rather, a city that adjoins the</b> state <b>border requires a wall, whereas</b> a city <b>that does not adjoin the</b> state <b>border does not require a wall.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why don’t <b>the Rabbis</b> make this distinction? The Gemara answers: Even if a city does not adjoin the border, <b>it sometimes happens that</b> invading <b>troops come</b> into the area. Therefore, it is always good for a city to be protected by a wall.
With regard to this issue, <b>Rabbi Elazar asked Rabbi Yoḥanan: When</b> the residents of the city <b>collect</b> money to build a wall, <b>do they collect based on</b> the number of <b>people</b> living in each house, <b>or perhaps they collect based on the</b> net <b>worth</b> of each person? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: They collect based on the</b> net <b>worth</b> of each person, <b>and Elazar, my son,</b> you shall <b>fix nails in this,</b> i.e., this is an established <i>halakha</i>, and you must not veer from it.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar asked Rabbi Yoḥanan: When they collect</b> money to build a wall, <b>do they collect based on the proximity of the houses</b> to the wall, so that those people who live closer to the wall pay more? <b>Or perhaps they collect based on the</b> net <b>worth</b> of each person. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: They collect based on the proximity of the houses</b> to the wall, <b>and Elazar, my son,</b> you shall <b>fix nails in this.</b>
§ It is related that <b>Rabbi Yehuda Nesia</b> once <b>imposed</b> payment of the tax for <b>the wall</b> even <b>on the Sages. Reish Lakish said to him: The Sages do not require protection, as it is written:</b> “How precious are your dear ones to me, O God…<b>If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand”</b> (Psalms 139:17–18). <b>If I should count whom? If we say</b> this is referring to <b>the righteous,</b> and the verse is saying <b>that they are greater in number than the</b> grains of <b>sand,</b> this is difficult. <b>Now</b> if <b>it is written about all of Israel: “As the sand which is upon the seashore”</b> (Genesis 22:17), can <b>the righteous themselves,</b> who are a part of Israel, <b>be greater in number than the</b> grains of <b>sand?</b> How can they possibly outnumber the grains of sand upon the seashore?
<b>Rather, this</b> is what the verse <b>is saying:</b> If <b>I should count the deeds of the righteous, they are greater in number than the</b> grains of <b>sand. And</b> it follows by <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>If the</b> grains of <b>sand, which are fewer</b> in number, <b>protect</b> the shore from <b>the sea,</b> barring it from flowing inland (see Jeremiah 5:22), <b>do not all the more so the deeds of the righteous, which are greater</b> in number, <b>protect them?</b> Consequently the Sages do not need additional protection.
<b>When</b> Reish Lakish <b>came before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and reported the exchange to him, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: What is the reason</b> that <b>you did not quote this</b> verse <b>to him: “I am a wall and my breasts are like towers”</b> (Song of Songs 8:10), which may be explained as follows: <b>“I am a wall”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Torah. “And my breasts are like towers”;</b>

Daf 8a

<b>these are Torah scholars,</b> and towers do not require additional protection? The Gemara comments: <b>And Reish Lakish,</b> who did not cite this verse, <b>holds</b> in accordance with the way that <b>Rava expounded</b> the verse: <b>“I am a wall”; this</b> is referring to <b>the Congregation of Israel. “And my breasts are like towers”; these are the synagogues and study halls.</b>
It is similarly related that <b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda</b> once <b>imposed</b> payment of <b>the</b> poll <b>tax [<i>karga</i>]</b> even <b>on the Sages. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to him: You have transgressed</b> the words of <b>the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings.</b>
You have transgressed the words of <b>the Torah, as it is written: “Even when He loves the peoples, all His holy ones are in Your hand”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:3), which is understood to mean that <b>Moses said to the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, even when You hold the</b> other <b>nations dear</b> and grant them dominion over Israel, let <b>“all His holy ones,”</b> meaning the Torah scholars, <b>be</b> exclusively <b>in Your hand</b> and free from the authority of the nations, and therefore be exempt from pay-ing taxes. The continuation of that verse can also be understood as referring to Torah scholars, as it states: <b>“And they sit [<i>tukku</i>] at Your feet,</b> receiving Your words” (Deuteronomy 33:3), and <b>Rav Yosef teaches: These are Torah scholars who pound [<i>mekhatetim</i>] their feet from city to city and from country to country to study Torah; “receiving [<i>yissa</i>] Your words,” to discuss [<i>lissa velitten</i>] the utterances of God.</b>
And you have transgressed the words of <b>the Prophets, as it is written: “Though they have hired lovers [<i>yitnu</i>] among the nations, now I will gather them, and they will begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of kings and princes”</b> (Hosea 8:10). With regard to this verse, <b>Ulla says:</b> Part of <b>this verse is stated in the Aramaic language;</b> the word <i>yitnu</i> should be understood here in its Aramaic sense: To learn. And the verse should be interpreted as follows: <b>If all</b> of Israel <b>learns</b> Torah, <b>I will gather them</b> already <b>now; and if</b> only <b>a few of them</b> learn Torah, <b>they will be excused from the burden</b> imposed <b>by kings and princes.</b> This indicates that those who study Torah should not be subject to paying taxes.
And furthermore, you have transgressed the words of <b>the Writings, as it is written: “It shall not be lawful to impose tribute, impost or toll upon them”</b> (Ezra 7:24), i.e., upon the priests and Levites who serve in the Temple. This <i>halakha</i> would apply to Torah scholars as well. <b>And Rav Yehuda says: “Tribute”; this</b> is referring to <b>the king’s portion,</b> a tax given to the king. <b>“Impost”; this</b> is referring to <b>the head tax. “Toll”; this</b> is referring to <b>a tax [<i>arnona</i>]</b> paid with property that was imposed from time to time.
It is related that <b>Rav Pappa</b> once <b>imposed</b> a tax for <b>the digging of a new</b> cistern even <b>on orphans. Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said to Rav Pappa: Perhaps</b> they will dig, but in the end <b>they will not draw</b> any <b>water</b> from there, and it will turn out that the money will have been spent for nothing. The rest of the townspeople can relinquish their rights to their money, but orphans who are minors cannot do so. Rav Pappa <b>said to him: I shall collect</b> money <b>from</b> the orphans; <b>if they draw</b> water, <b>they</b> will <b>draw</b> water, <b>and if not, I will return</b> the money <b>to</b> the orphans.
<b>Rav Yehuda says: All</b> of the city’s residents must contribute <b>to</b> the building and upkeep of <b>the city gates [<i>le’aglei gappa</i>],</b> and for this purpose money is collected <b>even from orphans. But the Sages do not require protection</b> and are therefore exempt from this payment. <b>All</b> of the city’s residents must contribute <b>to the digging of cisterns [<i>lekarya patya</i>],</b> and for this purpose money is collected <b>even from the Sages,</b> since they too need water. The Gemara comments: <b>And we said</b> this <b>only when</b> the people are <b>not</b> required to <b>go out en masse [<i>be’akhluza</i>]</b> and do the actual digging, but are obligated merely to contribute money for that purpose. <b>But if</b> the people are required to <b>go out en masse</b> and actually dig, <b>the Sages</b> are <b>not</b> expected to <b>go out</b> with them <b>en masse,</b> but rather they are exempt from such labor.
It is related that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi once <b>opened</b> his <b>storehouses</b> to distribute food <b>during years of drought. He said: Masters of Bible, masters of Mishna, masters of Talmud, masters of <i>halakha</i>, masters of <i>aggada</i> may enter</b> and receive food from me, <b>but ignoramuses should not enter. Rabbi Yonatan ben Amram,</b> whom Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi did not know, <b>pushed</b> his way in, <b>and entered,</b> and <b>said to him: Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>sustain me.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him: My son, have you read</b> the Bible? Rabbi Yonatan ben Amram <b>said to him,</b> out of modesty: <b>No.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi continued: <b>Have you studied</b> Mishna? Once again, Rabbi Yonatan ben Amram <b>said to him: No.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi then asked him: <b>If so, by what</b> merit <b>should I sustain you?</b> Rabbi Yonatan ben Amram <b>said to him: Sustain me like a dog and like a raven,</b> who are given food even though they have not learned anything. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was moved by his words and <b>fed him.</b>
<b>After</b> Rabbi Yonatan <b>left, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>sat, and was distressed, and said: Woe is me, that I have given my bread to an ignoramus.</b> His son, <b>Rabbi Shimon bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>said to him: Perhaps he was your disciple Yonatan ben Amram, who never in his life wanted to</b> materially <b>benefit from the honor</b> shown to the <b>Torah? They investigated</b> the matter <b>and found</b> that such was the case. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi then <b>said: Let everyone enter,</b> as there may also be others who hide the fact that they are true Torah scholars.
Commenting on Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion, the Gemara notes that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi conformed <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning,</b> as <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: Suffering comes to the world only due to ignoramuses.</b> This is <b>like</b> the incident of <b>the crown tax [<i>kelila</i>] that was imposed on</b> the residents of the city of <b>Tiberias.</b> The heads of the city <b>came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and said to him: The Sages should contribute</b> along <b>with us.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to them: No,</b> the Sages are exempt. <b>They said to him:</b> Then <b>we will run away</b> and the entire burden will fall on the Torah scholars. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to them: Run away</b> as you please. <b>Half</b> of the city’s residents <b>ran away.</b> The authorities then <b>waived half</b> the sum that they had initially imposed on the city.
<b>The half</b> of the population that remained in the city then <b>came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, and <b>said to him: The Sages should contribute</b> along <b>with us.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to them: No,</b> the Sages are exempt. They said to him: Then <b>we</b> too <b>will run away.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to them: <b>Run away</b> as you please. <b>They all ran away,</b> so that only <b>one launderer was left</b> in the city. The authorities <b>imposed</b> the entire tax <b>on the launderer. The launderer</b> then <b>ran away</b> as well. <b>The crown tax was</b> then <b>canceled</b> in its entirety. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: You see</b> from this <b>that suffering comes to the world only due to ignoramuses,</b> for as soon as they all fled from the city, the crown tax was completely canceled.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And how long</b> must one live <b>in the city to be</b> considered <b>like</b> one of <b>the people of the city?</b> Twelve months. <b>And we raise a contradiction</b> from what is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>a donkey caravan or a camel caravan that was journeying from place to place, and it lodged inside</b> an idolatrous city, <b>and its</b> members <b>were led astray</b> along <b>with</b> the other residents of the city, and they too engaged in idol worship, <b>they,</b> the members of the caravan, are liable to death <b>by stoning</b> like ordinary individual idolaters, <b>and their property escapes</b> destruction, i.e., they are not treated like the residents of an idolatrous city, who are liable to death by the sword and whose property is destroyed.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And if</b> the caravan members <b>had remained</b> in that city for <b>thirty days, they</b> are liable to death <b>by the sword and their property is destroyed,</b> just as it is for the rest of the residents of the city. This seems to indicate that once an individual has lived in a city for thirty days, he is already considered one of its residents.
<b>Rava said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> period, i.e., twelve months, is required in order to be considered one of the <b>members of the city;</b> and <b>that</b> period, i.e., thirty days, suffices in order to be considered one of the <b>residents of the city. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who is prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from the people of a</b> particular <b>city</b> is <b>prohibited from deriving benefit from anyone who has stayed there</b> for <b>twelve months,</b> but it is permitted for him to derive benefit from anyone who has stayed there for <b>less</b> time <b>than that.</b> By contrast, if he prohibited himself by way of a vow from deriving benefit <b>from the residents of a</b> particular <b>city,</b> he is <b>prohibited from deriving benefit from anyone who has stayed there</b> for <b>thirty days,</b> but <b>it is permitted for him to derive benefit from</b> anyone who has stayed there for <b>less</b> time <b>than that.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And do we require</b> that one live in a city for <b>twelve months for all matters? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one lives in city for <b>thirty days,</b> he must contribute <b>to</b> the <b>charity platter</b> from which food is distributed to the poor. If he lives there for <b>three months,</b> he must contribute <b>to</b> the charity <b>box.</b> If he lives there for <b>six</b> months, he must contribute <b>to</b> the <b>clothing</b> fund. If he lives there for <b>nine</b> months, he must contribute <b>to</b> the <b>burial</b> fund. If he lives there for <b>twelve</b> months, he must contribute <b>to</b> the <b>columns of the city [<i>lepassei ha’ir</i>],</b> i.e., for the construction of a security fence. <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When we learned twelve months in the mishna, we learned</b> that with regard to contributing <b>to</b> the <b>columns of the city,</b> money used for protecting and strengthening the city, but not for other matters.
<b>And Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All</b> are required to contribute <b>to</b> the <b>columns of the city, and</b> money is collected for that purpose <b>even from orphans. But the Sages</b> are <b>not</b> required to contribute, <b>since the Sages do not need protection. Rav Pappa said:</b> Money is collected <b>even from orphans for the</b> city <b>wall, for the</b> city <b>horseman, and for the guard [<i>uletarzina</i>]</b> of the city armory, <b>but the Sages do not require protection. The principle of the matter</b> is: Money is collected <b>even from orphans</b> for <b>anything from which they</b> derive <b>benefit.</b>
It is reported that <b>Rabba imposed</b> a contribution to a certain <b>charity on the orphans of the house of bar Maryon. Abaye said to him: But didn’t Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda teach: One does not impose a charity</b> obligation <b>on orphans even for</b> the sake of <b>redeeming captives,</b> since they are minors and are not obligated in the mitzvot? Rabba <b>said to him: I did this to elevate them</b> in standing, i.e., so that people should honor them as generous benefactors; not in order that the poor should benefit.
Incidental to this story, the Gemara relates that <b>Ifera Hurmiz, the mother of King Shapur,</b> king of Persia, <b>sent a purse [<i>arneka</i>]</b> full <b>of dinars to Rav Yosef. She said</b> to him: <b>Let</b> the money be used <b>for a great mitzva. Rav Yosef sat and considered</b> the question: <b>What</b> did Ifera Hurmiz mean when she attached a condition to the gift, saying that it should be used for <b>a great mitzva? Abaye said to him: From what Rav Shmuel bar Yehuda taught,</b> that <b>one does not impose a charity</b> obligation <b>on orphans even for</b> the sake of <b>redeeming captives, learn from this</b>

Daf 8b

that <b>redeeming captives is a great mitzva.</b>
<b>Rava said to Rabba bar Mari:</b> Concerning <b>this matter that the Sages stated, that redeeming captives is a great mitzva, from where is</b> it derived? Rabba bar Mari <b>said to him: As it is written: “And it shall come to pass, when they say to you: To where shall we depart? Then you shall tell them: So says the Lord: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for famine, to famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity”</b> (Jeremiah 15:2). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Whichever</b> punishment <b>is</b> written <b>later in this verse is more severe than the one</b> before it.
Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: <b>The sword is worse than death. If you wish, say</b> that this is learned from <b>a verse; if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived by way of <b>logical reasoning. If you wish, say</b> that this is derived by way of <b>logical reasoning: This</b> punishment, i.e., death by sword, <b>mutilates</b> the body, <b>but that</b> punishment, i.e., natural death, <b>does not mutilate</b> it. <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the fact that the sword is worse than death is learned from <b>a verse: “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His pious ones”</b> (Psalms 116:15).
<b>Famine is worse than the sword. If you wish, say</b> that this is derived by way of <b>logical reasoning: This one,</b> who dies of famine, <b>suffers</b> greatly before departing from this world, <b>but that one,</b> who dies by the sword, <b>does not suffer. If you wish, say</b> instead that the fact that famine is worse than the sword is learned from <b>a verse: “More fortunate were the victims of the sword than the victims of famine”</b> (Lamentations 4:9). And <b>captivity is worse than all of them, as it includes all of them,</b> i.e., famine, the sword, and death.
§ In connection with the previous discussion concerning charity distribution, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> in which <b>the Sages taught:</b> Money for <b>the charity fund is collected by two</b> people <b>and distributed by three</b> people. <b>It is collected by two</b> people <b>because one does not appoint an authority over the community</b> composed <b>of fewer than two</b> people. <b>And it is distributed by three people, like</b> the number of judges needed in cases of <b>monetary law,</b> since the distributors determine who receives money and who does not, as well as how much each person receives.
Food for <b>the charity platter is collected by three</b> people <b>and distributed by three</b> people <b>because its collection and its distribution</b> take place on <b>the same</b> day. Food for <b>the charity platter</b> is collected and distributed <b>every day,</b> and therefore a third individual must participate in the collection so that he will be available to take part in the distribution without delay; whereas the money of <b>the charity fund</b> is distributed only once a week, on <b>each Shabbat eve.</b>
There are additional differences between these two types of charity operations: The food from <b>the charity platter</b> is distributed <b>to the poor of the world,</b> meaning, to any poor individual arriving in the city; the money of <b>the charity fund</b> is allocated exclusively <b>to the poor of the city. But it is permitted for the residents of the city to use</b> money that has been collected for <b>the charity fund</b> to purchase food for <b>the charity platter</b> to feed the poor; <b>and</b> similarly they may use food that had been collected for <b>the charity platter</b> for <b>the charity fund.</b> In general, it is permitted for them <b>to change</b> the purpose toward which charity will be used <b>to whatever they want,</b> in accordance with the needs of the community.
Similarly, <b>it is permitted for the residents of the city to set the measures</b> used in that city, <b>the prices</b> set for products sold there, <b>and the wages</b> paid <b>to</b> its <b>workers, and to fine</b> people <b>for violating their</b> specifications, in order to enforce observance of these <i>halakhot</i>. This marks the end of the <i>baraita</i>, the details of which the Gemara proceeds to analyze.
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>One does not appoint an authority over the community</b> composed <b>of fewer than two</b> people. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that this is derived from a verse referring to those engaged in building the Tabernacle and weaving the priestly vestments, who received the community’s donations. <b>The verse states: “And they shall take the gold,</b> and the sky-blue wool, and the purple wool” (Exodus 28:5). The plural “they” indicates that the collection must be performed by two people.
The Gemara comments: The <i>baraita</i> indicates that <b>authority may not be exercised</b> by less than two people, <b>but</b> even a single individual <b>is trusted</b> to be a treasurer. That is, money for the charity fund is collected by two people, not because a single individual is not trusted not to misappropriate the money, but rather because a single individual should not be given authority over the community. <b>This supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina says: There was an incident where Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>appointed two brothers to</b> administer <b>the charity fund.</b> Even though the brothers were relatives who are not trusted to testify against each other, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was not concerned and he appointed them.
The Gemara asks: <b>What authority</b> is associated with collecting charity? The Gemara answers: <b>As Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: Because they can seize collateral for the charity;</b> i.e., they can collect charity by force, <b>and even on Shabbat eve,</b> when people are busy and might claim that they have no time or money. The Gemara objects: <b>Is that so? But isn’t it written: “I will punish all that oppress them”</b> (Jeremiah 30:20), <b>and Rabbi Yitzḥak bar Shmuel bar Marta says in the name of Rav: And</b> punishment will be meted out <b>even to charity collectors?</b> If charity collectors are permitted to force people to contribute charity, why are they counted among Israel’s oppressors?
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> Rabbi Naḥman’s statement, applies <b>when</b> the contributor is <b>rich,</b> in which case the collectors may seize money from him even by force. <b>That,</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak’s statement, applies <b>when</b> he is <b>not rich,</b> in which case the collectors who take money from him by force are termed oppressors of Israel. <b>This</b> right to force contributions from the rich is <b>like</b> what occurred in the incident in which <b>Rava compelled Rav Natan bar Ami and took four hundred dinars from him for charity.</b>
Having raised the issue of charity collection, the Gemara cites various rabbinic expositions with regard to the matter. The verse states: <b>“And they who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament;</b> and they who turn many to righteousness like the stars for ever and ever” (Daniel 12:3). <b>“And they who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament”; this is a judge who judges an absolutely true judgment,</b> as his wisdom and understanding lead him to a correct judgment. <b>“And they who turn many to righteousness like the stars for ever and ever”; these are the charity collectors,</b> who facilitate the giving of charity.
<b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: “And they who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the firmament”; this is a judge who judges an absolutely true judgment and</b> also <b>charity collectors. “And they who turn many to righteousness like the stars for ever and ever”; these are schoolteachers.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Like whom?</b> Certainly not every schoolteacher is worthy of such accolades. <b>Rav said: For example, Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat. As</b> it is told that <b>Rav</b> once <b>found Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat standing in a garden.</b> Rav <b>said to him: Have you abandoned your trust</b> and neglected your students? Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat <b>said to him: It has been thirteen years</b> now <b>that I have not seen</b> my garden, <b>and even now my thoughts are on</b> the children.
In light of the praises heaped upon judges, tax collectors, and schoolteachers, the Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> was said about <b>the Sages? Ravina said</b> that about them it is stated: <b>“But let them that love Him be as the sun when it comes out in its might”</b> (Judges 5:31).
The Gemara resumes its discussion of the <i>halakhot</i> of charity collection: <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Charity collectors may not separate from each other,</b> each one collecting in a different place; <b>but</b> in a place where the two can see each other, one collector <b>may separate</b> from the other, e.g., <b>this</b> one going <b>to the gate</b> of a house <b>and that</b> one going <b>to a store.</b> If a charity collector <b>found coins in the market, he may not put them into his</b> own <b>pocket, but</b> rather <b>he must put them into the charity purse, and</b> then later <b>when he comes home, he may take them</b> from there. This is necessary so that people should not suspect him of taking charity money for himself. <b>Similarly,</b> if the charity collector <b>was owed one hundred dinars by another, and</b> the latter <b>repaid</b> his debt <b>in the market,</b> the collector <b>may not put</b> the money he received <b>into his</b> own <b>pocket, but</b> rather <b>he must put it into the charity purse, and</b> then later <b>when he comes home, he may take it.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Charity collectors who have no poor people to</b> whom they can <b>distribute</b> the money, <b>may exchange [<i>poretin</i>]</b> the money, i.e., exchange the copper coins, which tend to rust, for silver dinars, <b>with other</b> people, <b>but they should not change it</b> by <b>themselves,</b> i.e., with their own coins, to avoid any suspicion of wrongdoing. Likewise, <b>collectors</b> of food <b>for the charity platter who do not have poor people</b> to whom <b>to distribute</b> the food <b>may sell</b> the food <b>to others, but they should not sell it to themselves,</b> for a similar reason. <b>Coins of charity are not counted two</b> by two, <b>but rather one by one,</b> to avoid errors in tallying.
<b>Abaye said: At first,</b> my <b>Master,</b> Rabba, <b>would not sit on the mats in the synagogue because</b> they had been purchased with charity funds. <b>Once he heard that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that it is permitted for the residents of a city <b>to change</b> the purpose toward which charity will be used <b>to whatever they want, he did sit</b> on them. <b>Abaye said: At first,</b> my <b>Master,</b> Rabba, <b>would make two purses, one for the poor of</b> the rest of <b>the world, and one for the poor of his city. Once he heard what Shmuel said to Rav Taḥalifa bar Avdimi: Make</b> only <b>one purse,</b>

Daf 9a

<b>and stipulate about it</b> with the people of your city that the money collected will be given to whomever needs it, <b>he too made</b> only <b>one purse and stipulated</b> with the people of his city <b>about it. Rav Ashi said: I do not even need to make a stipulation, as whoever comes</b> to donate to this charity fund <b>comes</b> relying <b>on my discretion and</b> understanding that <b>I will give</b> the funds <b>to whomever I want.</b>
The Gemara relates: There were <b>these two butchers who made an agreement with each other that whichever one of them worked on the day</b> assigned <b>to the other</b> according to their mutually agreed-upon schedule <b>would tear up the hide</b> of the animal that he slaughtered that day. <b>One of them went and worked on the other’s day, and</b> the other butcher <b>tore up the hide</b> of the animal that he slaughtered. <b>They came before Rava</b> for judgment, and <b>Rava obligated him to pay</b> the butcher who slaughtered that animal.
<b>Rav Yeimar bar Shelamya raised an objection to Rava:</b> Isn’t it stated among actions that the residents of a city may take: <b>And to fine</b> people <b>for violating their</b> specifications, i.e., those ordinances that the residents passed? <b>Rava did not respond to him. Rav Pappa said: He did well that he did not respond to him,</b> as <b>this matter</b> applies only <b>where there is no important person</b> in the city, in which case it is permitted for the residents of the city to draw up ordinances on their own. <b>But where there is an important person, it is not in</b> the residents’ <b>power to make stipulations,</b> i.e., regulations; rather, they are required to obtain the approval of the city’s leading authority to give force to their regulations.
§ <b>The Sages taught: One does not calculate</b> sums <b>with charity collectors concerning</b> the money they collected <b>for charity,</b> to verify how much they received and how much they distributed, <b>nor</b> does one calculate sums <b>with the</b> Temple <b>treasurers concerning</b> the property <b>consecrated</b> to the Temple. <b>And even though there is no</b> explicit <b>proof of the matter</b> from the Bible, there is nevertheless <b>an allusion to the matter, as it is stated: “And they did not reckon with the men into whose hand they delivered the money to pay out to the workmen; for they dealt in good faith”</b> (II Kings 12:16).
<b>Rabbi Elazar says: Even though a person has a trusted treasurer in his house</b> like the aforementioned Temple treasurers, who were fully trusted, <b>he should</b> nevertheless <b>tie up</b> his money <b>and count</b> it, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And the king’s scribe and the High Priest came up, <b>and they tied</b> it in bags <b>and counted</b> the money…And they gave the money that was counted into the hands of them that did the work, that had the oversight of the House of the Lord” (II Kings 12:11–12).
<b>Rav Huna says:</b> Charity collectors <b>examine</b> the level of poverty of one who asks <b>for food, but they do not examine</b> the level of poverty of one who asks <b>for clothing.</b> If a person comes before the charity collectors in tattered clothes, he is given clothing without any questions being asked. <b>If you wish, say</b> that this distinction is derived from <b>a verse; if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived via <b>logical reasoning.</b>
<b>If you wish, say</b> that this distinction is derived via <b>logical reasoning: This one</b> who stands before us in rags <b>is exposed to contempt, whereas that one</b> who is hungry <b>is not exposed to contempt. If you wish, say</b> instead that this distinction is derived from <b>a verse,</b> as it is written: <b>“Is it not to share [<i>paros</i>] your bread with the hungry?”</b> (Isaiah 58:7). The word <i>paros</i> <b>is written with a <i>shin</i>,</b> alluding to the word <i>parosh</i>, meaning <b>examine</b> and investigate, <b>and</b> only <b>then</b> should you <b>give him. And there</b> in the same verse <b>it is written</b> with regard to clothing: <b>“When you see the naked, that you cover him,”</b> indicating that <b>“when you see”</b> him you should <b>immediately</b> cover him.
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> just the opposite: Charity collectors <b>examine</b> the level of poverty of one who asks <b>for clothing, but they do not examine</b> the level of poverty of one who asks <b>for food.</b> He too adduces supports for his opinion. <b>If you wish, say</b> that this distinction is derived via <b>logical reasoning; if you wish, say</b> instead that it is derived from <b>a verse.</b>
<b>If you wish, say</b> that this distinction is derived via <b>logical reasoning: This one</b> who is hungry <b>suffers, whereas that one</b> who is in tattered clothing <b>does not suffer</b> in the same way. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that this distinction is derived from <b>a verse. Here, it is written: “Is it not to share [<i>paros</i>] your bread with the hungry?”</b> meaning, <b>share</b> it <b>immediately, just as</b> the word <b>is read.</b> Since the word is read with a <i>samekh</i>, Rav Yehuda does not understand it as alluding to examining the recipient. <b>And there, it is written: “When you see the naked, that you cover him,”</b> meaning, <b>when it will be</b> clearly <b>apparent to you,</b> after you have investigated the matter and found that the supplicant is deserving, then you shall cover him. The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yehuda:</b> If a poor person <b>said: Cover me</b> with clothing, the charity collectors <b>examine him;</b> but if he said: <b>Sustain me</b> with food, <b>they do not examine him.</b>
<b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Pe’a</i> 8:7): <b>One does not give a poor person who is traveling from place to place</b> requesting charity <b>less than a loaf</b> worth <b>a <i>pundeyon</i>,</b> one forty-eighth of a <i>sela</i>, when the standard price of grain is <b>four <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>.</b> If the poor person <b>sleeps</b> in that place, <b>one gives him provisions for lodging.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>provisions for lodging? Rav Pappa said: A bed and a pillow [<i>bei sadya</i>].</b> And if he <b>spends Shabbat</b> in that place, <b>one gives him food for three meals.</b> A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> a poor person <b>was going door to door</b> asking for charity, one is <b>not</b> required to <b>attend to him</b> and give him money from the charity fund.
It is related that <b>a certain poor person who was going door to door</b> requesting charity <b>came before Rav Pappa,</b> the local charity collector, but Rav Pappa <b>did not attend to him. Rav Sama, son of Rav Yeiva, said to Rav Pappa: If the Master does not attend to him, nobody else will attend to him</b> either; <b>should he</b> be left to <b>die</b> of hunger? Rav Pappa said to him: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> a poor person <b>was going door to door</b> asking for charity, one is <b>not</b> required to <b>attend to him?</b> Rav Sama <b>said to him:</b> That <i>baraita</i> means to say that one is <b>not</b> required to <b>attend to him</b> and give him <b>a large gift,</b> since he is already collecting money as he goes door to door, <b>but one does attend to him</b> and give him <b>a small gift.</b>
<b>Rav Asi says: A person should never prevent himself from giving</b> at least <b>one-third of a shekel a year</b> in charity, <b>as it is stated: “And we also established mitzvot upon ourselves, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the House of our God”</b> (Nehemiah 10:33). <b>And Rav Asi says: Charity is equivalent to all the</b> other <b>mitzvot</b> combined, <b>as it is stated</b> in that verse: <b>“We also established mitzvot upon ourselves.” A mitzva is not written here, but</b> rather <b>mitzvot,</b> in the plural, thereby teaching that this mitzva is equivalent to all the other mitzvot.
The Gemara offers <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the following statements extolling the mitzva of charity: <b>Greater; Temple; Moses. Rabbi Elazar says: One who causes others to perform [<i>me’aseh</i>]</b> a meritorious act <b>is greater than one who performs</b> that act himself, <b>as it is stated: “And the causing [<i>ma’aseh</i>] of righteousness shall be peace, and the work of righteousness, quietness, and assurance forever”</b> (Isaiah 32:17). If one <b>merits,</b> the following verse is applied to him: <b>“Is it not to share your bread with the hungry?”</b> (Isaiah 58:7), i.e., he will wholeheartedly give charity to the poor. If he <b>does not merit,</b> the latter clause of that verse is applied to him: <b>“You shall bring the poor that are cast out to your house,”</b> i.e., he will be compelled by the government to billet soldiers in his house and sustain them against his will.
<b>Rava said to the people of Meḥoza: I beg of you, strive with each other</b> to perform acts of charity and righteousness, <b>so that you will</b> live in <b>peace with the government,</b> since if you do not act charitably toward each other, you will end up paying fines to the government. <b>And Rabbi Elazar says: When the Temple is standing, a person contributes his shekel</b> for the Temple service <b>and achieves atonement</b> for his sins. <b>Now that the Temple no longer stands, if</b> people <b>act charitably,</b> it will be <b>well</b> for them; <b>but if not, the nations of the world will come and take</b> their money <b>by force.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And even so,</b> the money taken from them by force <b>is credited to them as</b> if they had freely given <b>charity, as it is stated:</b> “And I will make <b>your oppressors charity”</b> (Isaiah 60:17).
<b>Rava said: This</b> following matter <b>was told to me</b> by <b>the infant</b>

Daf 9b

<b>who perverted the ways of his mother.</b> He said <b>in the name of Rabbi Elazar: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And He donned charity like a coat of mail”</b> (Isaiah 59:17)? This verse serves <b>to tell you</b> that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>this coat of mail, each and every scale</b> of which it is fashioned <b>combines to</b> form <b>one large coat of mail, so too</b> with regard to <b>charity, each and every <i>peruta</i></b> that one gives <b>combines to</b> form <b>a great sum. Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> The same idea is derived <b>from here,</b> as it is stated: <b>“And all our charity is as a polluted garment”</b> (Isaiah 64:5). <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>this garment, each and every thread</b> in it <b>combines to</b> form <b>one large garment, so too</b> with regard to <b>charity, each and every <i>peruta</i> combines to</b> form <b>a great sum.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>Why was</b> this Sage <b>called the infant who perverted the ways of his mother?</b> It was because of the following incident: <b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami asked Rav Sheshet: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a leper renders a person impure</b> through contact <b>during his days of counting,</b> i.e., during the seven days that the leper must count from the start of his purification process, when he brings his birds, until he completes that process with the bringing of his sacrifices? Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: Since he renders</b> his <b>garments impure,</b> as it states that on the seventh day of his purification he must wash his clothes (see Leviticus 14:9), <b>he</b> also <b>renders people impure.</b>
Rav Aḥadvoi <b>said to him: Perhaps connected impurity is different,</b> meaning perhaps he renders his garments impure because they are connected to the source of the impurity, but this does not mean that he renders impure a person whom he touches. A proof for this distinction may be brought from the fact <b>that</b> if <b>one moves an animal carcass,</b> an action that renders him impure even if there was no actual contact with the carcass, <b>he renders</b> the <b>garments</b> that he is wearing <b>impure but does not render</b> another <b>person impure.</b>
Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: But from where do we</b> derive that the carcass of <b>a creeping animal renders a person impure? Is it not because</b> we know <b>that it renders</b> his <b>garments impure?</b> Rav Aḥadvoi <b>said to him: It is written explicitly</b> with regard to the carcass of <b>a creeping animal: “Or a man who touches any creeping animal,</b> whereby he may be made unclean” (Leviticus 22:5). Rav Sheshet said to him: <b>But from where do we</b> derive that <b>semen renders a person impure? Is it not because</b> we say that <b>since it renders</b> his <b>garments impure</b> (see Leviticus 15:17) <b>it</b> also <b>renders a person impure?</b> Rav Aḥadvoi <b>said to him: It is also written explicitly</b> with regard to <b>semen: “Or a man</b> from whom semen is expelled” (Leviticus 22:4), and the Sages expound the superfluous word “or” as serving <b>to include</b> as impure <b>one who touches</b> semen.
The Gemara relates that with each of his answers Rav Aḥadvoi <b>responded to</b> Rav Sheshet <b>in a mocking tone,</b> intimating that he doubted Rav Sheshet’s grasp of Torah verses. <b>Rav Sheshet was</b> deeply <b>offended,</b> and as punishment, <b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Ami became mute and forgot his learning.</b> Rav Aḥadvoi’s <b>mother came and wept before</b> Rav Sheshet. <b>She cried and cried but he ignored her.</b> As she had once been Rav Sheshet’s nursemaid, <b>she said to him: Look at these breasts of mine from which you suckled.</b> Upon hearing that, Rav Sheshet <b>prayed for mercy for</b> Rav Aḥadvoi, <b>and he was healed.</b> And since it was Rav Aḥadvoi whose behavior led to his mother’s acting in this manner, he was referred to as the infant who perverted his mother’s ways.
The Gemara comments: With regard to <b>that which we arrived at,</b> i.e., this particular subject, let us clarify the matter: <b>From where do we</b> derive that a leper renders impure a person with whom he comes into contact during his days of counting? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai says: Washing garments is stated with respect to his days of counting, and washing garments is stated with respect to his days of confirmed</b> leprosy, after he has been declared conclusively impure by a priest. <b>Just as there,</b> when he is a confirmed leper <b>he renders a person impure,</b> as is explicitly stated in the Torah, <b>so too here,</b> during his days of counting <b>he renders a person impure.</b>
§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the virtues of giving charity. <b>Rabbi Elazar said: One who performs</b> acts of <b>charity in secret is greater than Moses, our teacher. Whereas with regard to Moses, our teacher, it is written: “For I was afraid of the anger and the wrath”</b> (Deuteronomy 9:19), <b>with regard to one who performs</b> acts of <b>charity it is written: “A gift in secret pacifies anger, and a present in the bosom fierce wrath”</b> (Proverbs 21:14). The Gemara comments: <b>And this</b> statement <b>disagrees with</b> a statement <b>of Rabbi Yitzḥak, as Rabbi Yitzḥak says:</b> A secret gift <b>pacifies anger,</b> but it <b>does not pacify wrath, as it is stated: “And a present in the bosom fierce wrath,”</b> meaning that <b>although a present is in the bosom,</b> i.e., even if one gives charity in secret, nevertheless <b>fierce wrath</b> can still harm him. <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> as follows: <b>Any judge who accepts a bribe brings fierce wrath upon the world, as it is stated: “And a present in the bosom</b> fierce wrath.”
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Anyone who gives a <i>peruta</i> to a poor person receives six blessings, and whoever consoles him with words</b> of comfort and encouragement <b>receives eleven blessings.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>One who gives a <i>peruta</i> to a poor person receives six blessings, as it is written: “Is it not to share</b> your bread with the hungry, <b>and that you shall bring the poor that are cast out to your house? When you see the naked,</b> that you cover him” (Isaiah 58:7). And the next verses list six blessings: “Then shall your light break forth like the dawn, and your health shall spring forth speedily, and your righteousness shall go before you, the glory of the Lord shall be your rearguard. Then, shall you call, and the Lord shall answer; you shall cry, and He shall say: Here I am” (Isaiah 58:8–9).
<b>And whoever consoles</b> a poor person <b>with words</b> of comfort and encouragement <b>receives eleven blessings, as it is stated: “And if you draw out your soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul, then shall your light shine in darkness, and your gloom shall be as the noonday. And the Lord shall guide you continually, and satisfy your thirst in drought… And they that shall be of you shall build the old waste places, you shall raise up the foundations of many generations”</b> (Isaiah 58:10–12).
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He who pursues charity and mercy finds life, charity, and honor”</b> (Proverbs 21:21)? Is this to say that <b>because one has pursued charity, he</b> himself <b>shall find charity?</b> That is, shall the reward of one who has always given charity be that he will eventually become poor and other people will act charitably toward him? <b>Rather,</b> the verse serves <b>to tell you</b> that with regard to <b>anyone who pursues charity,</b> giving to the poor and leading others to do so, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, furnishes him with money with which to perform</b> his acts of <b>charity.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, sends him people who are deserving of charity, so that he will reap</b> his just <b>reward for</b> helping <b>them.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>What</b> does this statement serve <b>to exclude?</b> It serves <b>to exclude Rabba’s homiletical interpretation</b> of a different verse, <b>as Rabba taught: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Let them be made to stumble before You; deal thus with them in the time of Your anger”</b> (Jeremiah 18:23)? The prophet <b>Jeremiah said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, even when</b> those wicked men who pursued me <b>subdue their inclinations and seek to perform</b> acts of <b>charity before You, cause them to stumble upon</b> dishonest <b>people who are not deserving</b> of charity, <b>so that they will not receive reward</b> for coming to their assistance.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Anyone who is accustomed to performing</b> acts of <b>charity merits</b> blessing; <b>he will have sons who are masters of wisdom, masters of wealth, and masters of <i>aggada</i>.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>Masters of wisdom, as it is written:</b>

Daf 10a

“He who pursues charity and mercy, <b>finds life”</b> (Proverbs 21:21), and with regard to wisdom it is written: “He who finds Me, finds life” (Proverbs 8:35). <b>Masters of wealth, as it is written:</b> “He who pursues charity and mercy finds <b>charity,”</b> meaning he will be able to give charity. <b>Masters of <i>aggada</i>, as it is written:</b> “He who pursues charity and mercy, finds <b>honor.”</b> And how do we know that this refers to masters of <i>aggada</i>? <b>It is written here “honor,” and it is written there: “The wise shall inherit honor”</b> (Proverbs 3:35).
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir would say: An opponent may bring an argument against you and say to you: If your God loves the poor, for what</b> reason <b>does He not support them</b> Himself? In such a case, <b>say to him:</b> He commands us to act as His agents in sustaining the poor, <b>so that through them we will be</b> credited with the performance of mitzvot and therefore be <b>saved from the judgment of Gehenna. And this is the question that Turnus Rufus the wicked asked Rabbi Akiva: If your God loves the poor, for what</b> reason <b>does He not support them</b> Himself? Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him:</b> He commands us to sustain the poor, <b>so that through them</b> and the charity we give them <b>we will be saved from the judgment of Gehenna.</b>
Turnus Rufus <b>said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>On the contrary, it is this</b> charity <b>which condemns you,</b> the Jewish people, <b>to Gehenna</b> because you give it. <b>I will illustrate</b> this <b>to you with a parable. To what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to a king of flesh and blood who was angry with his slave and put him in prison and ordered that he should not be fed or given to drink. And one person went ahead and fed him and gave him to drink. If the king heard about this, would he not be angry with</b> that person? <b>And you,</b> after all, <b>are called slaves, as it is stated: “For the children of Israel are slaves to Me”</b> (Leviticus 25:55). If God decreed that a certain person should be impoverished, one who gives him charity defies the will of God.
<b>Rabbi Akiva said to</b> Turnus Rufus: <b>I will illustrate</b> the opposite <b>to you with a</b> different <b>parable. To what is this matter comparable?</b> It is comparable <b>to a king of flesh and blood who was angry with his son and put him in prison and ordered that he should not be fed or given to drink. And one person went ahead and fed him and gave him to drink. If the king heard</b> about this once his anger abated, <b>would he not</b> react by <b>sending</b> that person <b>a gift? And we are called sons, as it is written: “You are sons of the Lord your God”</b> (Deuteronomy 14:1).
Turnus Rufus <b>said to him: You are called sons and you are called slaves. When you fulfill the will of the Omnipresent, you are called sons; when you do not fulfill the will of the Omnipresent, you are called slaves. And</b> since <b>now you do not fulfill the will of the Omnipresent,</b> the parable that I offered is more apt. Rabbi Akiva <b>said to him:</b> The verse <b>states: “Is it not to share your bread with the hungry, and</b> that <b>you shall bring the poor that are cast out to your house?”</b> (Isaiah 58:7). <b>When</b> do we <b>bring the poor that are cast out</b> into our <b>houses? Now,</b> when we have to billet the Roman soldiers in our homes; <b>and</b> about that very time, the verse <b>states: “Is it not to share your bread with the hungry?”</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda, son of Rabbi Shalom taught: Just as a person’s</b> entire <b>livelihood is allocated to him from Rosh HaShana,</b> when God issues His judgments for the entire year, <b>so too are a person’s</b> monetary <b>losses allocated to him from Rosh HaShana.</b> If <b>one merits,</b> the following verse is applied to him: <b>“You shall share your bread with the hungry,”</b> i.e., he will spend the sum allocated to him on gifts of charity; and if <b>he does not merit,</b> the following verse is applied to him: <b>“You shall bring the poor that are cast out to your house,</b> i.e., he will be compelled by the government to billet soldiers in his house and feed them against his will.
It is <b>like this</b> incident <b>involving the nephews of Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai,</b> who once <b>saw in a dream that</b> his nephews <b>were</b> destined <b>to lose seven hundred dinars</b> over the course of the year. <b>He encouraged them</b> and <b>took</b> money <b>from them for charity, and they were left with seventeen dinars</b> out of the seven hundred. <b>When Yom Kippur eve arrived, the government sent</b> messengers who came and <b>took</b> the remaining seventeen dinars.
<b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to them: Do not fear</b> that they will take even more from you; <b>they took from you</b> the <b>seventeen dinars</b> that were still <b>with you.</b> The nephews <b>said to him: How did you know?</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to them: I saw a dream about you,</b> and he related his dream to them. <b>They said to him: And why did you not tell us</b> about the dream? Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to them: I said,</b> It is better <b>that they perform a mitzva for its own sake.</b> Had you known from the start that you were fated to lose that amount of money, the mitzva would not have been performed purely for its own sake.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Pappa was</b> once <b>climbing</b> up <b>a ladder</b> when <b>his foot slipped and he almost fell. He said: Now, is the one who hates us,</b> a euphemism for himself, <b>liable like Shabbat desecrators and idol worshippers,</b> who are subject to death by stoning, which is similar to death by falling, the punishment that Rav Pappa narrowly escaped? <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav of Difti said to Rav Pappa: Perhaps a poor person</b> once <b>approached you and you did not sustain him,</b> and therefore you were given a glimpse of the punishment that you actually deserve.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: Anyone who turns his eyes away from</b> one seeking <b>charity is</b> considered <b>as if he worships idols.</b> From where is this derived? <b>It is written here: “Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart…</b>and your eye be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing” (Deuteronomy 15:9). <b>And it is written there: “Certain base men have gone out…</b>and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods” (Deuteronomy 13:14). <b>Just as there,</b> the base men sin with <b>idolatry, so too here,</b> the base thought is treated like <b>idolatry.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: All</b> acts of <b>charity and kindness that Jews perform in this world</b> make <b>great peace and</b> are <b>great intercessors between the Jewish people and their Father in Heaven, as it is stated: “So said the Lord, enter not into a house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them, for I have taken away My peace from this people,</b> says the Lord, <b>both kindness and mercy”</b> (Jeremiah 16:5). <b>“Kindness”; this</b> is referring to <b>acts of kindness. “Mercy”; this</b> is referring to acts of <b>charity.</b> This indicates that when there is kindness and mercy, God is at peace with His people.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Great is charity in that it advances the redemption, as it is stated: “So said the Lord, uphold justice and do charity, for My salvation is near to come, and My righteousness to be revealed”</b> (Isaiah 56:1). <b>He would say: Ten strong entities were created in the world,</b> one stronger than the other. <b>A mountain is strong,</b> but <b>iron,</b> which is stronger, <b>cleaves it. Iron is strong,</b> but <b>fire melts it. Fire is strong,</b> but <b>water extinguishes it. Water is strong,</b> but <b>clouds bear it. Clouds are strong,</b> but <b>wind disperses them. Wind is strong,</b> but the human <b>body withstands it.</b> The human <b>body is strong,</b> but <b>fear breaks it. Fear is strong,</b> but <b>wine dispels it. Wine is strong,</b> but <b>sleep drives it off. And death is stronger than them all, but charity saves</b> a person <b>from death, as it is written: “And charity delivers from death”</b> (Proverbs 10:2, 11:4).
<b>Rabbi Dostai, son of Rabbi Yannai, taught: Come and see that the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He, is not like the attribute of flesh and blood.</b> An illustration of <b>the attribute of flesh and blood</b> is that when <b>a person brings a great gift to the king, it is uncertain whether</b> the king <b>will accept it from him or will not accept it from him. And if you say that</b> the king <b>will accept it from him, it is uncertain whether</b> the person who brought the gift <b>will</b> eventually <b>see the face of the king, or will not see the face of the king. But the Holy One, Blessed be He, does not</b> act in <b>this way.</b> Even when <b>a person gives a</b> mere <b><i>peruta</i> to a poor person, he merits to receive the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “As for me, I will behold Your face through charity; I will be satisfied, when I awake, with Your likeness”</b> (Psalms 17:15).
It is related that <b>Rabbi Elazar would</b> first <b>give a <i>peruta</i> to a poor person and</b> only <b>then</b> would he <b>pray. He said: As it is written</b> in the same verse: <b>“I will behold Your face through charity.”</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that which is written: <b>“I will be satisfied, when I awake, with your likeness”? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: These are Torah scholars,</b> who in pursuit of their studies <b>banish sleep from their eyes in this world, and the Holy One, Blessed be He, satiates them with the radiance of the Divine Presence in the World-to-Come.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He that graciously gives to the poor makes a loan to the Lord,</b> and that which he has given, He will pay him back” (Proverbs 19:17)? How can it be that one is considered to have granted a loan to God? <b>Were it not</b> explicitly <b>written in the verse, it would be impossible to say this,</b> that somebody who is gracious to a poor person is seen as lending to God. It would be impertinent, since <b>“the borrower is servant to the lender”</b> (Proverbs 22:7), <b>as it were.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: Rabbi Yoḥanan raises a contradiction</b> between two texts. In one place <b>it is written: “Riches profit not on the day of wrath, but charity delivers from death”</b> (Proverbs 11:4), <b>and</b> elsewhere <b>it is written: “Treasures of wickedness profit nothing, but charity delivers from death”</b> (Proverbs 10:2). <b>Why</b> is it necessary to have <b>these two</b> verses about <b>charity,</b> that it delivers from death? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba continues: <b>One</b> verse serves to teach <b>that</b> charity <b>delivers from an unnatural death</b> in this world, <b>and one</b> verse serves to teach <b>that</b> charity <b>delivers from the judgment of Gehenna</b> in the World-to-Come. <b>And</b> in <b>which</b> of the verses <b>is that</b> charity <b>which delivers from the judgment of Gehenna</b> mentioned? It is in <b>that</b> verse <b>in which “wrath” is written, as</b> with regard to the day of judgment <b>it is written: “That day is a day of wrath”</b> (Zephaniah 1:15). <b>And which</b> type of charity <b>is that which delivers from an unnatural death?</b>

Daf 10b

It is the type in which <b>one gives</b> the charity <b>without knowing to whom he gave it,</b> and the other <b>one takes it without knowing from whom he took it.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>One gives it without knowing to whom he gave it,</b> this serves <b>to exclude</b> the practice <b>of Mar Ukva,</b> who would personally give charity to poor people without their knowing he was the donor. The other one <b>takes it without knowing from whom he took it;</b> this serves <b>to exclude</b> the practice <b>of Rabbi Abba,</b> who would render his money ownerless, so that poor people would come and take it without his knowing whom he helped, although they would know from whom the money came. The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, how</b> then <b>should one act</b> to conceal his own identity and also remain ignorant of the identities of the recipients? The Gemara answers: The best method is <b>to put</b> the money <b>into the charity purse.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from what is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What should a person do to have male offspring? Rabbi Eliezer says: He should distribute his money liberally among the poor. Rabbi Yehoshua says: He should gladden his wife before</b> engaging in the <b>mitzva</b> of conjugal relations. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: A person should not donate a <i>peruta</i> to the charity purse unless</b> a great and trusted individual <b>like Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyon is appointed</b> as supervisor <b>over it.</b> This seems to indicate that putting money into the charity box is not always preferred. The Gemara answers: <b>When we say</b> that putting money into the charity box is the preferred way to give charity, this is referring to <b>when</b> a man <b>like Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyon is appointed</b> as supervisor <b>over it.</b>
The Gemara discusses other matters concerning charity. <b>Rabbi Abbahu says: Moses said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, with what shall the horn of Israel be exalted?</b> God <b>said to him: With</b> the passage of <b>“When you raise,”</b> i.e., Israel will be exalted by way of the donations and charity that they will give, as it is stated: “When you raise the heads of the children of Israel…then shall they give” (Exodus 30:12).
<b>And Rabbi Abbahu says: They asked</b> King <b>Solomon, son of David: How far does the power of charity extend?</b> King Solomon <b>said to them: Go out and see what my father David explained: “He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor, his righteousness endures forever, his horn shall be exalted with honor”</b> (Psalms 112:9). <b>Rabbi Abba said:</b> It is derived <b>from here</b> how far the power of charity extends: <b>“He shall dwell on high, his place of defense shall be the fortress of rocks; his bread shall be given, his water shall be sure”</b> (Isaiah 33:16). <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>“He shall dwell on high, his place of defense shall be the fortress of rocks”? Because “his bread shall be given”</b> to the poor, <b>and “his water shall be sure,”</b> i.e., it shall be given faithfully and he can be trusted in the matter.
<b>And Rabbi Abbahu says: They asked</b> King <b>Solomon: Who is one</b> who is destined <b>for the World-to-Come?</b> King Solomon <b>said to them: All</b> those about whom it is stated: <b>“And before His Elders will be His glory”</b> (Isaiah 24:23), referring to those who are honored in this world due to their wisdom. This is <b>like</b> the incident involving <b>Yosef, son of Rabbi Yehoshua, who became ill</b> and <b>fainted.</b> When he returned to good health, <b>his father said to him: What did you see</b> when you were not conscious? Yosef <b>said to him: I saw an inverted world. Those above,</b> i.e., those who are considered important in this world, were <b>below,</b> insignificant, while <b>those below,</b> i.e., those who are insignificant in this world, were <b>above.</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: You have seen a clear world.</b> The world you have seen is the true world, one in which one’s spiritual and moral standing determines his true importance. Rabbi Yehoshua further asked him: <b>And how did you see us,</b> the Torah scholars, there? Yosef <b>said to him: Just as we are important here, we are important there.</b>
Yosef added: <b>And I heard that they were saying</b> in that world: <b>Happy is the one who arrives with his studies in hand. And I</b> also <b>heard that they were saying: Those executed by the government</b> enjoy such exalted status that <b>no one can stand in their section.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who are these</b> martyrs to whom Yosef was referring? <b>If we say</b> that he was referring to <b>Rabbi Akiva and his colleagues,</b> who were killed by the Romans, this cannot be: Is their elevated status <b>due</b> only <b>to</b> the fact that <b>they were martyred by</b> the Roman <b>government and nothing more?</b> These men were exceptional in their piety and sanctity during their lives as well. Therefore <b>it</b> is <b>obvious that even without</b> their martyrdom they would be greater than other people. <b>Rather,</b> it is referring to those like <b>the martyrs of Lod,</b> who died for the sanctification of God’s name but were not Torah scholars.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to his students: My sons, what is</b> the meaning of <b>that which the verse states: “Righteousness exalts a nation, but the kindness of the peoples is sin”</b> (Proverbs 14:34)? <b>Rabbi Eliezer answered and said: “Righteousness exalts a nation”; these are</b> the people of <b>Israel, as it is written: “And who is like your people Israel, one nation on the earth?”</b> (I Chronicles 17:21). <b>“But the kindness of the peoples is sin,”</b> meaning that <b>all the</b> acts of <b>charity and kindness that the nations of the world perform is</b> counted as <b>a sin for them, since they perform them only to elevate themselves</b> in prestige, <b>as it is stated: “That they may sacrifice offerings of pleasing aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and of his sons”</b> (Ezra 6:10). Even though they donated offerings, they did so only for their own benefit.
The Gemara asks: <b>And if one acts this way, is it not full-fledged charity? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one who says:</b> I am contributing <b>this <i>sela</i> to charity so that my sons will live, or</b> if he says: I am performing the mitzva <b>so that I will merit</b> a share in <b>the World-to-Come, this</b> person <b>is a full-fledged righteous person,</b> as far as that mitzva is concerned, even though he has his own welfare in mind? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the statement that he is considered absolutely righteous is <b>with regard to a Jew;</b> while <b>there,</b> the statement that such benefaction is not credited as charity is <b>with regard to a gentile.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua answered</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s challenge to interpret the verse <b>and said: “Righteousness exalts a nation”; these are</b> the people of <b>Israel, as it is written: “And who is like your people Israel, one nation</b> on the earth.” <b>“But the kindness of the peoples is sin”</b> means that <b>all the</b> acts of <b>charity and kindness that the nations of the world perform is</b> counted as <b>a sin for them, since they perform them only to perpetuate their dominion, as it is stated</b> by Daniel to Nebuchadnezzar: <b>“Therefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by charity, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; that there may be an extension of your serenity”</b> (Daniel 4:24). Since this is the argument that persuaded Nebuchadnezzar, it would appear that his actual motive was his own benefit.
<b>Rabban Gamliel answered and said: “Righteousness exalts a nation”; these are</b> the people of <b>Israel, as it is written: “And who is like your people Israel,</b> one nation on the earth.” <b>“But the kindness of the peoples is sin”</b> means that <b>all the</b> acts of <b>charity and kindness that the nations of the world perform is</b> counted as <b>a sin for them, since they perform them only in order to act haughtily through them, and whoever acts haughtily falls into Gehenna, as it is stated: “The proud and haughty one, scorner is his name, acts in arrogant wrath”</b> (Proverbs 21:24). <b>And wrath means nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “That day is a day of wrath”</b> (Zephaniah 1:15).
<b>Rabban Gamliel said: We still need</b> to hear what <b>the Moda’i</b> has to say, as <b>Rabbi Eliezer HaModa’i says: “Righteousness exalts a nation”; these are</b> the people of <b>Israel, as it is written: “And who is like your people Israel, one nation on the earth.” “But the kindness of the peoples is sin”</b> means that <b>all the</b> acts of <b>charity and kindness that the nations of the world perform is</b> counted as <b>a sin for them, since they perform them only to taunt us with them, as it is stated</b> that the Babylonian officer Nebuzaradan said: <b>“The Lord has brought it, and done according as He has said; because you have sinned against the Lord and have not obeyed His voice, therefore this matter is come upon you”</b> (Jeremiah 40:3).
<b>Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana answered and said: “Righteousness exalts a nation and kindness”</b> is referring to <b>Israel; and</b> in addition, <b>“of the peoples is sin.” Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to his students: The statement of Rabbi Neḥunya ben HaKana appears</b> to be more precise <b>than</b> both <b>my statement and your statements, because he assigns</b> both <b>righteousness and kindness to Israel, and sin to the peoples</b> of the world. The Gemara asks: <b>By inference,</b> it appears <b>that he,</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai, <b>also offered</b> an interpretation of this verse. <b>What is it? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to them</b> that the verse should be understood as follows: <b>Just as a sin-offering atones for Israel, so charity atones for the nations of the world.</b>
It is related that <b>Ifera Hurmiz, the mother of King Shapur,</b> king of Persia, <b>sent four hundred dinars to Rabbi Ami, but he did not accept them. She</b> then <b>sent them to Rava, and he accepted them for the sake of peace with the kingdom. Rabbi Ami heard</b> what Rava had done <b>and was angry. He said: Does</b> Rava <b>not accept</b> the lesson of the verse: <b>“When the boughs are withered, they shall be broken off; the women shall come and set them on fire”</b> (Isaiah 27:11), meaning that when righteousness has ceased from a particular nation, it is time for its citizens to be punished, and therefore we should not help them perform any meritorious deeds, which would delay their punishment? The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why did <b>Rava</b> accept the money? The Gemara answers: He did so <b>for the sake of peace with the kingdom.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> did <b>Rabbi Ami</b> not <b>also</b> see the importance of accepting the money <b>for the sake of peace with the kingdom?</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ami maintains that Rava <b>should have distributed</b> the money <b>to the gentile poor</b> rather than to the Jewish poor, as it is a disgrace to the Jews to require the kindness of the nations of the world in order to support their poor. The Gemara comments: In fact, <b>Rava also gave</b> the money <b>to the gentile poor</b> and not to the Jewish poor. <b>And Rabbi Ami got angry</b> because

Daf 11a

those who reported the story to him <b>did not conclude it before him;</b> consequently, Rav Ami was not informed that Rava had indeed given the money to the gentile poor.
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The following <b>was said about Binyamin the righteous, who was appointed</b> supervisor <b>over the charity fund. Once, a woman came before him during years of drought</b> and <b>said to him: My master, sustain me. He said to her:</b> I swear <b>by the Temple service that there is nothing</b> left <b>in the charity fund. She said to him: My master, if you do not sustain me, a woman and her seven sons will die. He arose and sustained her with his own</b> funds. <b>After some time, he fell deathly ill. The ministering angels said to the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, You said</b> that <b>anyone who preserves a single life in Israel is</b> regarded <b>as if he has preserved an entire world. Should</b> then <b>Binyamin the righteous, who saved a woman and her seven sons, die after these few years,</b> still in his youth? <b>They immediately tore up his sentence.</b> A Sage <b>taught: They added twenty-two years to his life.</b>
<b>The Sages taught:</b> There was <b>an incident involving King Munbaz, who liberally gave away his treasures and the treasures of his ancestors in the years of drought,</b> distributing the money to the poor. <b>His brothers and his father’s household joined together against him</b> to protest against his actions, <b>and they said to him: Your ancestors stored up</b> money in their treasuries <b>and added to</b> the treasures <b>of their ancestors, and you are liberally distributing</b> it all to the poor. King Munbaz <b>said to them:</b> Not so, <b>my ancestors stored up below, whereas I am storing above, as it is stated: “Truth will spring out of the earth and righteousness will look down from heaven”</b> (Psalms 85:12), meaning that the righteous deeds that one has performed are stored up in heaven. <b>My ancestors stored up</b> treasures <b>in a place where the</b> human <b>hand can reach,</b> and so their treasures could have been robbed, <b>whereas I am storing up</b> treasures <b>in a place where the</b> human <b>hand cannot reach,</b> and so they are secure, <b>as it is stated: “Righteousness and justice are the foundation of Your throne”</b> (Psalms 89:15).
<b>My ancestors stored up something that does not generate profit,</b> as money sitting in a treasury does not increase, <b>whereas I am storing up something that generates profit, as it is stated: “Say of the righteous, that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings”</b> (Isaiah 3:10). <b>My ancestors stored up treasures of money, whereas I am storing up treasures of souls, as it is stated: “The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and he that wins souls is wise”</b> (Proverbs 11:30). <b>My ancestors stored up for others,</b> for their sons and heirs, when they themselves would pass from this world, <b>whereas I am storing up for myself, as it is stated: “And it shall be as righteousness to you”</b> (Deuteronomy 24:13). <b>My ancestors stored up for this world, whereas I am storing up for the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “And your righteousness shall go before you, the glory of the Lord shall be your rearguard”</b> (Isaiah 58:8).
§ The Gemara resumes its analysis of the mishna, which taught that one must reside in a place for twelve months in order to be considered a resident for the purposes of issues such as paying taxes. But if he <b>bought</b> himself <b>a residence in</b> the city, <b>he is</b> immediately considered <b>like</b> one of <b>the people of the city.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If he bought any amount of land in</b> the city, and not necessarily a residence, <b>he is</b> immediately considered <b>like</b> one of <b>the people of the city.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If</b> one <b>bought land that is suitable for a residence, he is</b> immediately considered <b>like</b> one of <b>the people of the city.</b> This contradicts the first <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara answers: This is a dispute between <b>two <i>tanna’im</i> and</b> they disagree <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The court <b>does not divide a courtyard</b> at the request of one of the joint owners <b>unless there will be</b> in it four by <b>four cubits for this one and</b> four by <b>four cubits for that one,</b> i.e., this minimum area for each of the joint owners. <b>And</b> the court does <b>not</b> divide <b>a</b> jointly owned <b>field unless there is</b> space <b>in it</b> to plant <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed <b>for this one and nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed <b>for that one. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The court does not divide a field <b>unless there is</b> space <b>in it</b> to plant <b>nine half-<i>kav</i></b> of seed <b>for this one and nine half-<i>kav</i></b> of seed <b>for that one. And</b> the court does <b>not</b> divide a jointly owned <b>garden unless there is</b> space <b>in it</b> to plant <b>a half-<i>kav</i></b> of seed <b>for this one and a half-<i>kav</i></b> of seed <b>for that one. Rabbi Akiva says</b> that half that amount is sufficient, i.e., the <b>area required for sowing a quarter-<i>kav</i> of seed [<i>beit rova</i>].</b>
Similarly, the court does <b>not</b> divide <b>a hall [<i>hateraklin</i>], a drawing room, a dovecote, a cloak, a bathhouse, an olive press, and an irrigated field unless there is enough for this one</b> to use the property in the usual manner <b>and enough for that one</b> to use the property in the usual manner. <b>This is the principle: Anything</b> for <b>which</b> when it <b>is divided,</b> each of the parts is large enough to <b>retain the name</b> of the original item, the court <b>divides</b> it. <b>But if</b> the parts will <b>not</b> retain the original name, the court <b>does not divide</b> it.
<b>When</b> does this rule apply? It applies <b>when</b> the joint owners <b>do not both wish</b> to divide the item; when only one of the owners wishes to divide the property, he cannot force the other to do so. <b>But when both of them wish</b> to divide the item, <b>they may divide</b> it, <b>even</b> if each of the owners will receive <b>less than</b> the amounts specified above. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>sacred writings,</b> i.e., a scroll of any of the twenty-four books of the Bible, that were inherited by two people, <b>they may not divide</b> them, <b>even if both of them wish</b> to do so, because it would be a show of disrespect to cut the scroll in half.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The four cubits</b> of the courtyard <b>which they said</b> each of the joint owners must receive is <b>in addition to</b> the space in front of <b>the entrances</b> to each of the houses that is assigned to the owner of the house for loading and unloading. <b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The court <b>does not divide a courtyard unless</b> its area is sufficient so that <b>there will be in it eight cubits for this one and eight cubits for that one.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that it suffices that there be <b>four cubits for this one and four cubits for that one? Rather, conclude from it</b> that the <i>baraita</i> was taught <b>in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Asi.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from it</b> that it is so.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who raise</b> the <i>baraita</i> as a contradiction to what is taught in the mishna and use the previously mentioned point to reconcile the two texts. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: The court <b>does not divide a courtyard</b> at the request of one of the joint owners <b>unless there will be</b> in it four by <b>four cubits for this one and</b> four by <b>four cubits for that one. But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The court does not divide a courtyard unless there are <b>eight cubits for this one and eight cubits for that one?</b> About this <b>Rabbi Asi said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: The four cubits</b> of the courtyard <b>which they said</b> each of the joint owners must receive is <b>in addition to</b> the space in front of <b>the entrances</b> to each of the houses.
Further with regard to the division of a courtyard, <b>Rav Huna says: A courtyard is divided according to its entrances.</b> Each of the owners receives a share of the courtyard in proportion to the number of entrances that his house has opening onto the courtyard. <b>And Rav Ḥisda says: Four cubits are allotted</b> to each of the owners <b>for each and every entrance, and the rest</b> of the courtyard <b>is</b> then <b>divided equally</b> between them.
The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda:</b> Each of <b>the entrances</b> opening <b>to a courtyard</b> is allotted <b>four cubits.</b> If <b>this one has one entrance and that one has two entrances, the one who has one entrance takes four cubits, and the one who has two entrances takes eight cubits, and they divide the rest</b> of the courtyard <b>equally</b> between them. If <b>this one had an entrance eight cubits wide,</b> he <b>takes eight cubits adjacent to the entrance and four cubits in the courtyard.</b> The Gemara expresses surprise: <b>What are</b> these <b>four cubits in the courtyard doing here?</b> Doesn’t it all depend on the size of the courtyard? <b>Abaye said: This</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> For the entrance <b>he takes eight cubits along the length of the courtyard and four cubits along the width of the courtyard.</b> In other words, he takes a strip four cubits wide along the entire length of his entrance.
<b>Ameimar says: A pit for</b> holding <b>animal food [<i>peira desuflei</i>] has four cubits on each and every side</b> so that there will be sufficient space for the animals to stand. The Gemara adds: <b>And we said</b> this <b>only when</b> the pit <b>has no special entrance</b> to reach it, but rather it is accessed from all sides.

Daf 11b

<b>But</b> if <b>he designates an entrance</b> leading to this pit and does not approach it from all sides, <b>he has four cubits only in front of his entrance.</b>
<b>Rav Huna says: A portico [<i>akhsadra</i>]</b> that opens onto a courtyard <b>does not have</b> the adjoining <b>four cubits.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> that four cubits were granted for each entrance? The four cubits were granted so that the owner would have room <b>for unloading</b> his animal of <b>its burden. Here he can go inside</b> the portico <b>and unload. Rav Sheshet raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Both gates of houses and gates of porticos have</b> the adjoining <b>four cubits</b> for unloading. The Gemara answers: <b>When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught, it is</b> specifically <b>with regard to the portico of a study hall,</b> which is closed and is not used for unloading burdens. The Gemara expresses surprise at this answer: It is <b>obvious that</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>the portico of a study hall,</b> as <b>it is a proper room. Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a Roman portico,</b> which is more open than the portico of a study hall, but also not used for unloading.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A gatehouse, a portico, and a balcony</b> with a staircase leading down to the courtyard <b>have</b> the adjoining <b>four cubits</b> for unloading. Even if <b>five houses open onto the balcony, they only have four cubits</b> in front of the entrance to the staircase that leads to the balcony. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan asked Rabbi Yannai:</b> Does <b>a chicken coop</b> that also has a staircase <b>have four cubits or does it not have four cubits?</b> Rabbi Yannai <b>said to him: What is the reason</b> that four cubits are granted? It is so that the owner will have room <b>for unloading</b> the <b>burden</b> of <b>his</b> animal. <b>Here</b> this space is not needed, as the chickens <b>climb up</b> to get into the coop <b>and climb down</b> to get out. No additional place is required for the owner to stand alongside them.
<b>Rava asked Rav Naḥman:</b> If <b>a house</b> is <b>half roofed and half unroofed, does it have</b> the adjoining <b>four cubits or does it not have</b> the <b>four cubits?</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: It does not have</b> the <b>four cubits.</b> The Gemara comments: It is <b>not necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> when the house’s <b>roofing is</b> over <b>the inside</b> portion of the house, <b>since it is possible</b> for the owner <b>to go inside and unload</b> his animal. <b>Rather, even</b> when the house’s <b>roofing is</b> over <b>the outside</b> portion of the house, it is not given four cubits, as even in such a case <b>it is possible</b> for the owner <b>to go inside and unload</b> his animal there.
§ <b>Rav Huna asked Rabbi Ami:</b> If <b>one of the residents of an alleyway</b> onto which several courtyards open <b>wishes to alter his entrance to a different alleyway,</b> i.e., to make an entrance to his courtyard that will open onto a different alleyway, can <b>the residents of the</b> other <b>alleyway prevent him</b> from opening this entrance, <b>or can they not prevent him</b> from doing so? Rabbi Ami <b>said to him: The residents of</b> the other <b>alleyway can prevent him</b> from making the change.
Rav Huna further asked: When a king issues <b>a billeting</b> order to the residents of a courtyard, obligating them to house his soldiers in their homes, is the burden <b>divided according to</b> the number of <b>people</b> in each household, <b>or</b> is it <b>divided according to</b> the number of <b>entrances</b> that each house has opening into the courtyard? Rabbi Ami <b>said to him: It is divided according to the</b> number of <b>people</b> in each household. The Gemara comments: <b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The dung in a courtyard</b> which the residents wish to use <b>is divided</b> among them <b>according to</b> the number of <b>entrances</b> that open into the courtyard, whereas <b>billeting</b> is divided <b>according to</b> the number of <b>people</b> in each household.
<b>Rav Huna says:</b> If <b>one of the residents of an alleyway wishes to close off</b> an area <b>adjacent to his entrance,</b> i.e., to build a structure in the alleyway adjacent to the entrance to his courtyard, <b>the residents of the alleyway can prevent him</b> from doing so. This is because <b>it will increase the way for them,</b> since they will have to circumvent the structure when going to and from their homes.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>five courtyards open onto an alleyway, all</b> the residents of the alleyway may <b>use</b> that part of the alleyway that faces the entrance to <b>the outermost</b> courtyard, <b>and</b> the residents of <b>the outermost</b> courtyard may <b>use</b> only that part of the alleyway adjacent to <b>its own</b> entrance. <b>And</b> similarly, the residents of <b>the other</b> courtyards may <b>use</b> that part of the alleyway that faces <b>the second</b> courtyard, i.e., the one next to the outermost courtyard, <b>and</b> the residents of <b>the second</b> courtyard may <b>use</b> that part of the alleyway adjacent to <b>its own</b> entrance <b>and</b> they may <b>use</b> that part of the alleyway facing <b>the outermost</b> courtyard.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The <b>outcome</b> is that the residents of <b>the innermost</b> courtyard may <b>use</b> that part of the alleyway adjacent to <b>its own</b> entrance, <b>and</b> they may <b>use</b> that part of the alleyway facing <b>each and every</b> other courtyard as well. According to this analysis, it should be permitted for the owner of the innermost courtyard to close off the area in front of his courtyard, since he is the only one who has permission to use it.
The Gemara answers: It <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one of the residents of an alleyway wishes to alter his entrance to a different alleyway, the residents of the</b> other <b>alleyway can prevent him</b> from doing so. If <b>there had been</b> an entrance there beforehand which is now <b>sealed and he wishes to open it, the residents of the</b> other <b>alleyway cannot prevent him</b> from doing so; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If there are <b>five courtyards which open onto an alleyway,</b> the residents of all the courtyards <b>may all use the alleyway with each other.</b>
The Gemara expresses surprise about this last ruling: <b>Courtyards, who mentioned anything about them?</b> Why are they mentioned, considering that the <i>baraita</i> is not discussing the <i>halakhot</i> of courtyards? The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: Additionally,</b> if there are <b>five courtyards which open onto an alleyway,</b> the residents of all the courtyards <b>may all use</b> the area facing <b>the outermost</b> courtyard, <b>and the</b> residents of the <b>outermost one</b> may <b>use</b> only the area facing their <b>own</b> entrance; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b> If there are <b>five courtyards which open onto an alleyway,</b> the residents of all the courtyards <b>may all use the alleyway.</b>
The Gemara directs the discussion to the details mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master said:</b> If <b>there had been</b> an entrance there beforehand that is now <b>sealed and he wishes to open it, the residents of the</b> other <b>alleyway cannot prevent him</b> from doing so. <b>Rava says: This was taught only when he did not break its doorposts,</b> i.e., when the doorposts remained intact even after the entrance was sealed. <b>But if he</b> sealed the entrance and <b>broke its doorposts,</b> thereby demonstrating that the entrance had been completely negated, <b>the residents of the</b> other <b>alleyway can prevent him</b> from opening a new entrance. <b>Abaye said to Rava:</b> A <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught which supports you:</b>

Daf 12a

<b>A house</b> that has <b>a sealed</b> entrance still <b>has</b> the <b>four cubits</b> adjoining that entrance because the entrance can be reopened. If <b>one broke its doorposts</b> and sealed the entrance, the entrance is completely negated, and <b>it does not have</b> the <b>four cubits</b> adjoining it.
There is a similar distinction with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity. There is a <i>halakha</i> that a house in which there is a corpse transmits ritual impurity only through its doorways. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>A grave whose entrance is sealed does not render all its surroundings ritually impure;</b> the ritual impurity extends only to the area opposite the entrance. But if <b>one broke its doorposts and sealed it,</b> it is no longer considered an entrance, and the grave <b>renders all its surroundings ritually impure,</b> because impurity that has no egress bursts from all sides. Similarly, <b>a house</b> in which there is a corpse that has <b>a sealed</b> entrance <b>does not render all its surroundings ritually impure.</b> But if <b>one broke its doorposts,</b> it is no longer considered an entrance, and the corpse <b>renders all of its surroundings ritually impure.</b>
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>alleyways that are open to another city,</b> and through which one would ordinarily travel to reach that other city, if <b>the residents of the city</b> in which the alleyways are located <b>wished to block them</b> off, <b>the residents of the city</b> into which the alleyways open <b>can prevent them</b> from doing so, because they have a right to reach their city via those routes. The Gemara explains: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state <b>that they can prevent</b> them from blocking the alleyways <b>when there is no alternative route</b> to reach their town, <b>but they can prevent</b> them from blocking the alleyways <b>even when there is an alternative route.</b>
This is <b>due to</b> the reasoning that <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Rav says. As Rav says:</b> One is <b>prohibited from ruining a path that the public has established</b> as a public thoroughfare, i.e., steps may not be taken to prevent people from using it. This is in accordance with the statement <b>of Rav Giddel, as Rav Giddel says:</b> If <b>the public has chosen a route for itself</b> and they walk on it, <b>what they have chosen is chosen,</b> and it cannot be taken away from them.
<b>Rav Anan says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>alleyways that open onto a public thoroughfare,</b> if <b>the residents of the alleyways wished to put up doors</b> at the entrance to their alleyways, <b>the people</b> who use <b>the public thoroughfare can prevent them</b> from doing so.
Some Sages <b>understood from this</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies specifically to the area <b>within four cubits</b> of the public thoroughfare, <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>that Rabbi Zeira</b> says that <b>Rav Naḥman says, as Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: The four cubits</b> in an alleyway <b>that are adjacent to the public thoroughfare are considered like the public thoroughfare</b> itself. Consequently, this area has the <i>halakha</i> of a public thoroughfare. <b>But</b> that <b>is not so. There,</b> the ruling of Rav Naḥman was stated <b>with regard to the issue of ritual impurity,</b> with regard to which only the first four cubits of the alleyway are considered like the public thoroughfare. <b>But here,</b> with regard to doors set up at the entrance to the alleyway, <b>sometimes the public thoroughfare becomes crowded with people and they enter far</b> into the alleyway, even farther than four cubits.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> the court does <b>not</b> divide a jointly owned <b>field unless there is</b> space <b>in it</b> to plant <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed <b>for this one and nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed <b>for that one.</b> Rabbi Yehuda says: The court does not divide a field unless there is space in it to plant nine half-<i>kav</i> of seed for this one and nine half-<i>kav</i> of seed for that one. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> they <b>do not disagree</b> with regard to the fundamental <i>halakha</i>, as this <b>Sage</b> ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the custom of <b>his locale, and</b> that <b>Sage</b> ruled <b>in accordance with</b> the custom of <b>his locale.</b> In Rabbi Yehuda’s locale, even a smaller parcel of land was considered a viable field.
The Gemara asks: The mishna was taught in Eretz Yisrael; <b>what</b> practice should be followed <b>in Babylonia? Rav Yosef said:</b> In Babylonia, a parcel of land the size of which is <b>the area of a day’s plowing</b> is considered a field; if each of the parties will receive less than that, the field should not be divided.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by a parcel of land the size of which is <b>the area of a day’s plowing? If</b> it means <b>a day’s</b> plowing in <b>the planting</b> season, i.e., the winter, when it is easy to plow, since the earth has already been turned over at the end of the summer, the field will <b>not</b> require <b>two</b> full <b>days</b> of plowing in <b>the plowing</b> season, i.e., at the end of the summer, when it is more difficult to plow, since the earth is hard and dry. In that case, he will have to pay his summer plowman two days’ wages for less than two days of work. And <b>if</b> it means <b>a day’s</b> plowing in the <b>plowing</b> season, the field will <b>not</b> require a full <b>day</b> of plowing in the <b>planting</b> season. In that case, he will have to pay his winter plowman a full day’s wages for less than a full day of work.
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> it is referring to <b>a day’s</b> plowing in the <b>plowing</b> season, and the field will still require a full day of plowing in the planting season <b>since he plows</b> once before he sows the seeds <b>and</b> then he <b>repeats</b> the plowing after the seeds are sown. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is referring to <b>a day’s</b> plowing in the <b>planting</b> season, and the field will in fact require two full days of plowing in the plowing season if it is <b>rocky ground,</b> on which plowing takes longer.
In connection with this discussion, the Gemara clarifies the conditions under which <b>a cistern,</b> from which its joint owners draw their water, is divided. <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> It should be divided only if each party will receive <b>the volume of</b> water needed for <b>a day’s irrigation</b> work. As for <b>an orchard, Shmuel’s father says:</b> It should be divided only if each party will receive <b>an area</b> large enough to plant <b>three <i>kav</i>,</b> one-third of the measure required for a field.
<b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says to another: I am selling you part of a vineyard,</b> without specifying how much of the vineyard, <b>Sumakhos says: He may not</b> give him <b>less than an area</b> large enough to plant <b>three <i>kav</i>. Rabbi Yosei said: These are nothing other than words of prophecy,</b> i.e., I do not see the logic behind this statement, and it is as if based on prophecy and a heavenly decree, as the seller did not mention any area, but rather spoke in the most general of terms: Part of a vineyard. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the measure with regard to this matter <b>in Babylonia? Rava bar Kisna said: Three rows [<i>atzyata</i>] of twelve vines, which is</b> the area <b>a person can hoe in</b> a single <b>day.</b>
§ In connection with Rabbi Yosei’s statement that Sumakhos’s words are nothing but words of prophecy, the Gemara reports that <b>Rabbi Avdimi from Haifa says: From the day that the Temple was destroyed prophecy was taken from the prophets and given to the Sages.</b> The Gemara expresses astonishment: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>a Sage is not</b> fit to be <b>a prophet?</b> Rabbi Avdimi seems to say that these are two distinct categories of people. The Gemara explains: <b>This is what</b> Rabbi Avdimi <b>is saying: Even though</b> prophecy <b>was taken from the prophets, it was not taken from the Sages.</b>
<b>Ameimar said: And a Sage is greater than a prophet, as it is stated: “And a prophet has a heart of wisdom”</b> (Psalms 90:12), i.e., he is wise. When comparisons are drawn, <b>who is compared to whom? You must say</b> that <b>the lesser is compared to the greater.</b> Here too, prophecy is compared to wisdom, thus indicating that wisdom is greater than prophecy.
<b>Abaye said: Know</b> that this is so, that the Sages still enjoy the prophetic gift, <b>as a great man makes a statement</b> with regard to a point of <i>halakha</i> <b>and</b> the same statement <b>is</b> then <b>cited in the name of a different great man in accordance with his</b> statement, indicating that the Sages makes their statements by way of prophecy. <b>Rava</b> disagreed and <b>said: And what is the difficulty</b> with explaining this? <b>Perhaps they were born under the same constellation,</b> and since they are similar in their traits, they reach the same conclusions. <b>Rather, Rava said: Know</b> that this is so, <b>as a great man makes a statement and</b> the same statement <b>is</b> then <b>cited</b>

Daf 12b

<b>in the name of</b> the well-known <i>tanna</i> <b>Rabbi Akiva bar Yosef in accordance with his</b> statement. It certainly cannot be maintained that the first Sage is similar in his nature to the illustrious Rabbi Akiva, so he must have arrived at his statement through prophecy. <b>Rav Ashi said: And what is the difficulty</b> with explaining this? <b>Perhaps</b> they were born under <b>the same constellation,</b> and <b>with regard to this issue</b> the first Sage has the same understanding as Rabbi Akiva.
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: Know</b> that this is so, <b>as a great man makes a statement and</b> the same statement <b>is</b> then <b>cited as a <i>halakha</i></b> transmitted <b>to Moses from Sinai in accordance with his</b> statement. The Sage makes a statement that corresponds to words pronounced in Heaven, which, without prophecy, is beyond human capability. The Gemara states: <b>But perhaps</b> he arrived at this idea by chance, without the assistance of prophecy, <b>like a blind man</b> who makes his way <b>through a skylight.</b> A blind man cannot deliberately find a skylight; therefore, his finding it occurs by chance. The Gemara answers: <b>But does</b> the Sage <b>not offer a reason</b> for his statement? The fact that he demonstrates an understanding of the issue indicates that he does not arrive at his idea by chance, but rather by prophecy.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From the day that the Temple was destroyed, prophecy was taken from the prophets and given to imbeciles and children.</b> The Gemara explains: In <b>what</b> way was prophecy given <b>to imbeciles?</b> It was <b>like this</b> incident involving <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi, who was standing in the street [<i>beristeka</i>] of Meḥoza</b> when <b>he heard a certain imbecile say: The head of the yeshiva who will be appointed in Mata Meḥasya signs</b> his name <b>Tavyumei.</b> Mar bar Rav Ashi <b>said</b> to himself: <b>Who among the Sages signs</b> his name <b>Tavyumei?</b> Nobody but <b>me. Conclude from</b> the statement by the imbecile <b>that my hour has arrived,</b> and I will reap success in this matter. <b>He arose and went</b> to Mata Meḥasya. <b>By the time he arrived, the Sages</b> had already <b>decided to appoint Rav Aḥa of Difti as the head</b> of the yeshiva.
<b>As soon as</b> the Sages <b>heard that</b> Mar bar Rav Ashi <b>had arrived,</b> they determined not to proceed with their appointment without the approval of an important figure such as him. <b>They sent a pair of Sages to him to consult with him,</b> and <b>he detained them. They again sent a pair of Sages</b> to him, and <b>he detained them</b> as well. This continued <b>until they completed</b> a quorum <b>of ten</b> Sages. <b>Once they reached ten</b> men, Mar bar Rav Ashi <b>opened</b> his lecture, <b>taught, and expounded.</b> He did not speak earlier <b>because one should not open a lecture during <i>kalla</i>,</b> the gatherings for Torah study during the months of Elul and Adar, when <b>less than ten</b> men are present. He was then appointed as head of the yeshiva.
Understanding that he had been passed over for the position, <b>Rav Aḥa</b> of Difti <b>read about himself</b> the rabbinic aphorism: <b>Anyone who is treated poorly will not soon be treated well; and anyone who is treated well will not soon be treated poorly.</b> Rav Aḥa understood that he had lost the chance to be appointed, whereas Mar bar Rav Ashi had the good fortune to be appointed, and would remain in his position.
And in <b>what</b> way was prophecy given <b>to children?</b> It was <b>like this</b> incident involving the <b>daughter of Rav Ḥisda,</b> who when she was a child <b>was sitting on her father’s lap</b> while he sat and learned. <b>Rava and Rami bar Ḥama were sitting before him.</b> Rav Ḥisda jokingly <b>said to</b> his daughter: <b>Which of them would you want</b> as a husband? <b>She said:</b> I want <b>both of them. Rava said: And I</b> will be <b>last.</b> And this is what happened; first she married Rami bar Ḥama, and when he died she married Rava.
Having already cited one statement of Rabbi Avdimi from Haifa, the Gemara cites another statement in his name: <b>Rabbi Avdimi from Haifa says: Before a person eats and drinks he has two hearts,</b> meaning his heart is unsettled because he is distracted by hunger. But <b>after he eats and drinks he has only one heart, as it is stated: “A hollow [<i>nevuv</i>] man is two-hearted”</b> (Job 11:12). How is it indicated that “<i>nevuv</i>” means hungry? <b>As it is written</b> concerning the altar: <b>“<i>Nevuv luḥot</i>”</b> (Exodus 27:8), <b>which we translate</b> into Aramaic as: <b>Hollow with planks,</b> meaning that a hollow person, i.e., one who has not yet eaten, is two-hearted.
The Gemara continues to discuss the meaning of <i>nevuv</i>, <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says:</b> With regard to <b>one who is accustomed to wine, although his heart,</b> i.e., his mind, <b>is closed like a virgin, wine opens it, as it is stated: “And new wine opens [<i>yenovev</i>] the virgins”</b> (Zechariah 9:17). The word <i>yenovev</i> is used here in the sense of clearing out a space: Even if one’s heart and mind are closed, wine will open them to understanding.
§ The Gemara resumes its discussion of the division of property. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says:</b> It is <b>obvious</b> that if a person inherits <b>a portion</b> of his father’s estate because he is the <b>firstborn, and</b> he also inherits <b>a portion</b> of that estate as <b>an ordinary</b> son, like the rest of his brothers, <b>he is given</b> his two portions <b>along one boundary,</b> so that they are adjacent to one another and form a single property. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a <i>yavam</i>,</b> a man whose brother died without children, who is obligated by Torah law to marry his deceased brother’s widow or grant her <i>ḥalitza</i>? If he marries his brother’s widow, the <i>halakha</i> dictates that he receive his brother’s portion of their father’s estate in addition to his own. Does he too receive the two portions along one boundary?
<b>Abaye said: This</b> case <b>is</b> equal to <b>that</b> case. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The Merciful One calls</b> the <i>yavam</i> <b>“firstborn”</b> (see <i>Yevamot</i> 24a) and therefore he is treated like a firstborn in all regards. He receives the two portions of his father’s estate as a single parcel of land. But <b>Rava said: The verse states: “And it shall be, the firstborn”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:6). With regard to <b>his being,</b> i.e., his inheritance itself, he <b>is like a firstborn; but</b> as for <b>the distribution</b> of the estate, he <b>is not like a firstborn,</b> and the brothers are not obligated to give him two adjacent portions.
It is reported that <b>a certain person bought land along the boundary of his father’s property.</b> After some time the father died. <b>When they</b> came to <b>divide</b> the estate, this person <b>said to</b> his brothers: <b>Give me my portion</b> of the estate <b>along my boundary. Rabba said: In</b> a case <b>such as this,</b> the court <b>compels</b> people to refrain from <b>conduct</b> characteristic <b>of Sodom.</b> The court forces a person to waive his legal rights in order to prevent him from acting in a manner characteristic of the wicked city of Sodom. Since it makes no difference to the brothers which portion they receive since the parcels of land must be of equal value, whereas it matters to this brother that the area he receives should be adjacent to the land he already bought, the court forces the others to give this brother his portion along his boundary.
<b>Rav Yosef objects to this,</b> saying this is not a case involving conduct characteristic of Sodom, since the brothers can explain their refusal to grant the request. <b>The brothers</b> can <b>say to him: We assess this</b> field that you want for yourself <b>as</b> particularly <b>valuable, like the property of the house of bar Maryon.</b> The brothers can claim that the portion he wants is more desirable than the others, and for that reason they do not want to give it to him. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef,</b> and the brothers can refuse the request.
If a father leaves his two sons <b>two</b> parcels of <b>land next to two</b> water <b>channels [<i>nigrei</i>],</b> and one brother requests the field that is next to a field that he already owns, <b>Rabba says: In</b> a case <b>such as this,</b> the court <b>compels</b> people to refrain from <b>conduct</b> characteristic <b>of Sodom</b> and allows that brother to receive the field adjoining his own. <b>Rav Yosef objects to this,</b> saying that if the other brother protests and wants that parcel of land, it is not a case involving conduct characteristic of Sodom because he may have a valid reason for objecting: <b>Sometimes this</b> water channel <b>continues running</b> well, <b>while this</b> second one <b>does not continue running</b> well; therefore, the second brother wants to receive land that adjoins a water channel on both sides. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef.</b>
If a father leaves his two sons <b>two</b> parcels of land <b>next to one channel</b> and one of the brothers already owns a field next to one of those parcels of land, <b>Rav Yosef said: In</b> a case <b>such as this,</b> the court <b>compels</b> people to refrain from <b>conduct</b> characteristic <b>of Sodom</b> and allows that brother to receive the field adjoining his own. <b>Abaye objects to this,</b> saying that this is not a case involving conduct characteristic of Sodom because the other brother <b>can say</b> to him: <b>I want</b> the number of <b>sharecroppers to increase.</b> If my field is in the middle and you have fields on either side, you will need more sharecroppers to work them and my field will enjoy greater security. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef</b> because <b>the increase</b> of sharecroppers <b>is</b> considered as <b>nothing,</b> and this is therefore not a valid reason for objecting.

Daf 13a

If there is a water <b>channel</b> on <b>one side</b> of the field <b>and a river</b> on <b>the other side,</b> the field <b>is divided diagonally [<i>bekarna zol</i>]</b> between the two brothers, so that they each receive land adjoining both the river and the water channel.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>a hall,</b> a drawing room, and the like should <b>not</b> be divided unless the two parties will be able to use their respective portions in the same manner that they had previously used them. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>there is not enough for this one and that one?</b> What is to be done if one of the parties wishes to dissolve the partnership? <b>Rav Yehuda said: There is a <i>halakha</i></b> of: Either <b>you set</b> a price <b>or I will set</b> a price. That is to say, one party can say to the other: Set a price you are willing to pay for my share, and I will sell my share to you or purchase your share from you at that price. <b>Rav Naḥman said: There is no <i>halakha</i></b> of: Either <b>you set</b> a price <b>or I will set</b> a price; rather, the partnership continues.
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: According to you who say</b> that <b>there is no <i>halakha</i></b> of: Either <b>you set</b> a price <b>or I will set</b> a price, <b>what should they do</b> if there was <b>a firstborn</b> son <b>and</b> an <b>ordinary</b> brother <b>whose father left them a slave and a non-kosher animal</b> as an inheritance? How are they to be divided? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I say that they work for this one,</b> the ordinary brother, <b>one day, and for the other one,</b> the firstborn, <b>two days.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Yehuda’s approach from what is taught in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 41a): <b>One who is half-slave half-freeman,</b> e.g., a slave who had been jointly owned by two people, one of whom emancipated him, <b>serves his master one day and himself one day;</b> this is <b>the statement of Beit Hillel. Beit Shammai say: You have remedied</b> the situation of <b>his master,</b> who benefits fully from all his rights to the slave, but <b>you have not remedied his own</b> situation. <b>He cannot marry a maidservant,</b> since half of him is free, and a free Jew may not marry a Canaanite maidservant. <b>He is</b> also <b>not able to marry a free woman,</b> since half of him is a slave, and a Jewish woman may not marry a Canaanite slave. And if you say <b>he should be idle</b> and not marry, <b>but is it not</b> true that <b>the world was created only for procreation, as it is stated: “He did not create it to be a waste; He formed it to be inhabited”</b> (Isaiah 45:18)?
<b>Rather,</b> the court <b>forces his master to make him a freeman</b> by emancipating the half that he owns, <b>and</b> the court <b>writes a bill</b> in which the slave accepts responsibility to pay <b>half his value</b> to his master. This was the original version of the mishna. The ultimate version of the mishna records the retraction of Beit Hillel: <b>And Beit Hillel retracted</b> its opinion and <b>ruled in accordance with the statement of Beit Shammai.</b> This indicates that it is only in this case, where there is the particular consideration of procreation, that the court compels one of the parties to forfeit his portion and dissolve the partnership. But in other cases there is no <i>halakha</i> of: Either you set a price or I will set a price.
The Gemara answers: <b>It is different here, because</b> the slave can say: <b>I will set</b> a price, but he is <b>not</b> able to say: <b>You set</b> a price. In other words, the slave cannot offer to sell himself, because his Jewish side precludes him from selling himself as a Canaanite slave. Therefore, the court would not be able force the master to sell his share, were it not for the consideration of procreation. By contrast, in a situation where either side can buy or sell, one partner can compel the other to either buy his portion or sell his portion to him.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from what is taught in a mishna (172a): In a case where there are <b>two brothers, one poor and one rich, and their father left them a bathhouse or an olive press</b> as an inheritance, if the father had <b>built</b> these facilities <b>for profit,</b> i.e., to charge others for using them, <b>the profit</b> that accrues after the father’s death is <b>shared equally</b> by the two brothers. If the father had <b>built them for himself</b> and for the members of his household to use, the poor brother, who has little use for these amenities, cannot force the rich brother to convert the facilities to commercial use; rather, <b>the rich</b> brother can <b>say to the poor</b> brother:

Daf 13b

Go <b>take servants for yourself, and they will bathe in the bathhouse.</b> Or he can say: Go <b>take olives for yourself and come and transform</b> them into oil <b>in the olive press.</b> Evidently, the poor brother cannot say to him: Buy my share. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>There too</b> the poor brother can say: <b>You set</b> a price and buy my share, as the rich brother has the means to buy his poor brother’s portion; but he is <b>not</b> able to say: Or else <b>I will set</b> a price and buy your share, as the poor brother does not have the money to buy his brother out.
The Gemara further proposes: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from what is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Anything which,</b> even after it <b>is divided,</b> each of the parts <b>retains the name</b> of the original item, <b>may be divided.</b> And <b>if</b> the parts will <b>not</b> retain the original name, the item should not be divided, but rather <b>its monetary</b> value <b>is assessed,</b> because one of the joint owners can say to the other: Either you set a price and buy it from me, or I will set a price and buy it from you. The Gemara explains: Actually, this matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If a courtyard or the like was not large enough to warrant division into two, and one of the co-owners said to the other: <b>You take</b> a minimum <b>measure</b> of the courtyard, e.g., four cubits, <b>and I</b> will take <b>less,</b> the court <b>listens to him. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: They do not listen to him.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case under discussion? <b>If we say it is</b> exactly <b>as it is taught, what is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s reasoning?</b> Why does he rule that the court ignores the party who is prepared to settle for less? <b>Rather, is it not that</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what it <b>is saying:</b> If one of the co-owners said to the other: <b>You take</b> a minimum <b>measure</b> of the courtyard, <b>and I</b> will take <b>less,</b> all agree that the court <b>listens to him.</b> And the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> adds: <b>And</b> if one says: Either <b>you set</b> a price and buy it from me, <b>or I will set</b> a price and buy it from you, <b>they also listen to him. And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel comes to say:</b> In the first case the court does listen to him, but <b>they do not listen to him</b> when he says: Either you set a price or I will set a price. Accordingly, this issue is the subject of a tannaitic dispute.
The Gemara rejects this interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> should <b>actually</b> be understood exactly <b>as it is taught. And with regard to what you said: What is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel’s reasoning?</b> Why can’t one of the parties say that they should divide the property and he will settle for less? It is <b>because</b> the second one <b>can say to him: If</b> you want me to compensate you with <b>money</b> for the difference between my share and your share, <b>I have no money to give you.</b> And if you wish to give it to me as <b>a gift, I am not at ease</b> with that, <b>as it is written: “But he who hates gifts shall live”</b> (Proverbs 15:27). The <i>baraita</i> indicates that there is a <i>halakha</i> of: Either you set a price or I will set a price, in accordance with the opinion of Rav Yehuda.
As a continuation of this discussion, <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: That</b> statement <b>of Rav Yehuda is</b> actually the opinion <b>of Shmuel,</b> his teacher, <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna (11a): <b>But</b> in the case of <b>sacred writings,</b> i.e., a scroll of any of the twenty-four books of the Bible, that were inherited by two people, <b>they may not divide</b> them, <b>even if both of them wish</b> to do so, because it would be a show of disrespect to cut the scroll in half. <b>And Shmuel said: They taught</b> that sacred writings should not be divided <b>only</b> if they are contained <b>in one scroll; but</b> when they are contained <b>in two scrolls, they may be divided. And if it should enter your mind</b> to say <b>that there is no <i>halakha</i> of:</b> Either <b>you set</b> a price <b>or I will set</b> a price, <b>why</b> does the <i>halakha</i> apply <b>specifically to one scroll? Even</b> if the sacred writings were contained <b>in two scrolls,</b> they should <b>also</b> not divide them, since the respective parts will not be even and one of the recipients will have to compensate the other.
<b>Rav Shalman interpreted</b> the mishna: It is referring to a case <b>where they both want</b> to divide the sacred writings; therefore, Shmuel said that they may do so when they are contained in two scrolls. But if just one of them wishes to divide them, there is no proof that he can compel the other one to accept the division.
<b>Ameimar said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of Rav Yehuda that <b>there is a <i>halakha</i> of:</b> Either <b>you set</b> a price <b>or I will set</b> a price. <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: What</b> about <b>that</b> statement <b>of Rav Naḥman,</b> who disagrees with Rav Yehuda and says that there is no such <i>halakha</i>? Ameimar <b>said to him: I do not know</b> of it, <b>that is to say, I do not maintain</b> this opinion. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is the <i>halakha</i> <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav Naḥman? <b>But</b> it happened that <b>the father of Ravin bar Ḥinnana and Rav Dimi bar Ḥinnana</b> died and <b>left them two maidservants, one</b> of whom <b>knew how to bake and to cook, and the other</b> of whom <b>knew how to spin and to weave.</b> One of the brothers suggested that each of them take one of the maidservants entirely for himself and forfeit his rights to the other maidservant. <b>They came before Rava and he said to them: There is no <i>halakha</i> of:</b> Either <b>you set</b> a price <b>or I will set</b> a price.
The Gemara answers: It is <b>different there, since this master wanted both of them and the other master wanted both of them.</b> Therefore, <b>when</b> one of the brothers <b>said to</b> the other: <b>You take one and I</b> will take the other <b>one, it is not</b> a case of: Either <b>you set</b> a price <b>or I will set</b> a price. The Gemara asks: <b>And can we not say so? But</b> there is the case of <b>sacred writings, which both of them</b> presumably <b>want, and Shmuel said: They taught</b> that sacred writings should not be divided <b>only</b> if they are contained <b>in one scroll; but</b> when they are contained <b>in two scrolls, they may be divided.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Shalman interpreted</b> the mishna: It is referring to a case <b>where they</b> both <b>want</b> to divide the sacred writings, and in such a case they may divide them, provided that they are in two scrolls.
§ The Gemara now begins a general discussion about sacred writings. <b>The Sages taught: A person may attach the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings together as one</b> scroll; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: The Torah</b> should be a scroll <b>by itself,</b> the books of the <b>Prophets</b> a scroll <b>by themselves, and</b> the books of the <b>Writings</b> a scroll <b>by themselves. And the Sages say: Each one</b> of the books of the Prophets and the Writings should be a scroll <b>by itself.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> There was <b>an incident involving Baitos ben Zunin, who had eight</b> books <b>of the Prophets attached together as one</b> scroll, and he did this <b>with the approval of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya. And others say that each and every one</b> of the books was a scroll <b>by itself,</b> in accordance with the opinion of the Sages. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said:</b> There was <b>an incident where they brought before us the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings attached together as one</b> scroll <b>and we</b> ruled in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir and <b>deemed them fit.</b>
The Gemara states: When different books are included in the same scroll, <b>four</b> empty <b>lines</b> of space should be left <b>between each book of the Torah, and similarly between one</b> book of <b>the Prophets and another. But</b> between each of the books of <b>the Twelve Prophets</b> only <b>three</b> empty <b>lines</b> should be left, because they are considered one book. <b>And</b> the scribe may <b>finish</b> a book <b>at the bottom</b> of one column <b>and begin</b> the next book <b>at the top</b> of the next column without leaving any empty space in between.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who wishes to attach the Torah, the Prophets, and the Writings together as one</b> scroll <b>may attach</b> them. <b>He should leave enough</b> empty parchment <b>at the beginning</b> of the scroll <b>for winding around the pole</b> to which the beginning of the scroll is fastened. <b>And at the end</b> of the scroll he should leave enough empty parchment <b>for winding around the</b> entire <b>circumference</b> of the rolled-up scroll. <b>And he may finish</b> a book <b>at the bottom</b> of one column <b>and begin</b> the next book <b>at the top</b> of the next column without leaving any empty space between them.

Daf 14a

<b>And if he wishes to cut</b> the scroll, <b>he may cut</b> it. The Gemara is surprised at this: <b>What is</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>saying?</b> Why is mention made here of cutting the scroll? The Gemara answers: <b>This is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b> He arranges the text so that if he finishes a book at the bottom of one column, he begins the next book at the top of the next column without leaving any empty space, <b>so that if he wishes to cut</b> the scroll, <b>he may cut</b> it. If he does not begin the next book at the top of the next column, he will not be able to cut the scroll, because it is not fitting for a scroll to begin with an empty space.
The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between this <i>baraita</i> and another <i>baraita</i> that teaches: <b>Enough</b> parchment should be left at <b>the beginning of the scroll and at its end for winding.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>For winding</b> around <b>what? If</b> it means <b>for winding around the pole</b> to which the beginning of the scroll is fastened, this is <b>difficult</b> in light of what is taught in the first <i>baraita</i>, that at the end of the scroll enough parchment should be left for winding around the entire <b>circumference</b> of the scroll. And <b>if</b> it means <b>for winding around</b> the entire <b>circumference,</b> this is <b>difficult</b> in light of what is taught in the first <i>baraita</i> that at the beginning of the scroll enough parchment should be left for winding around the <b>pole.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>disjunctively,</b> referring to two separate cases. He issues a general statement requiring that enough parchment be left for winding as needed: At the beginning of the pole, enough to wind around the pole, and at the end of the scroll, enough to wind around the circumference.
<b>Rav Ashi said: When that</b> second <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> indicating that the same measure of parchment is left at both the beginning and the end of the scroll, it was referring <b>to a Torah scroll, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>All</b> other <b>scrolls are wound from the beginning to the end</b> around a single pole, <b>but a Torah scroll is wound</b> from both ends <b>to the middle</b> around two <b>poles,</b> one of which <b>he attaches at this</b> end of the scroll <b>and</b> the other <b>at the other</b> end. <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, said: This is how the scribes in Jerusalem made their scrolls,</b> i.e., with poles at either end so that it could be rolled to the middle.
§ <b>The Sages taught: A Torah scroll should not be made</b> in such a manner <b>that its length,</b> i.e., its height, <b>is greater than its circumference</b> when it is rolled up; <b>nor</b> should <b>its circumference be greater than its length. They asked Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>What should the size of a Torah scroll be?</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to them:</b> If it was written <b>on a hide that was treated with gallnuts [<i>gevil</i> ]</b> it should be <b>six</b> handbreadths long. They asked him further: <b>How much</b> should it be if it was written <b>on</b> ordinary <b>parchment [<i>kelaf</i> ]?</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to them: <b>I do not know.</b>
It is related that <b>Rav Huna wrote seventy Torah scrolls</b> himself, <b>and it happened for him</b> only <b>once</b> that the length and the circumference were equal. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov wrote one</b> Torah scroll <b>on calf hide and it happened</b> to have the same length and circumference. <b>The Sages looked at him</b> and his achievement with jealousy, <b>and he died</b> from their envious gaze.
<b>The Sages said to Rav Hamnuna: Rabbi Ami wrote four hundred Torah scrolls.</b> Rav Hamnuna <b>said to them: Perhaps he wrote</b> the verse: <b>“Moses commanded us the Torah”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:4) four hundred times, rather than four hundred complete Torah scrolls, as it is difficult to say that he could have written so many, even over a lifetime. Similarly, <b>Rava said to Rabbi Zeira: Rabbi Yannai planted four hundred vineyards.</b> Rava <b>said to him: Perhaps</b> he did not plant large vineyards, but only the smallest possible vineyards recognized by <i>halakha</i>, which are composed of <b>two</b> vines <b>facing</b> another <b>two</b> vines, with a fifth <b>one protruding</b> like <b>a tail,</b> extending out beyond the square.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to what is taught with regard to the length of a Torah scroll from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>the Ark</b> of the Covenant <b>that Moses fashioned, its length was two and one-half cubits, its width was one and one-half cubits, and its height was one and one-half cubits</b> (see Exodus 25:10), <b>the cubit</b> used for these measurements <b>being six handbreadths.</b> Therefore, the Ark was fifteen handbreadths long, nine handbreadths wide, and nine handbreadths high.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> as for <b>the tablets, their length was six</b> handbreadths, <b>their width was six</b> handbreadths, <b>and their thickness was three</b> handbreadths. The tablets <b>were placed along the length of the Ark,</b> one next to the other. If so, <b>how much</b> space did <b>the tablets occupy</b> along the length <b>of the Ark? Twelve handbreadths,</b> as each tablet was six handbreadths long. <b>Three handbreadths were left there</b> along the length of the Ark, for a total of fifteen handbreadths. <b>Deduct a handbreadth from them: One-half</b> a handbreadth <b>for this wall,</b> namely, the thickness of the wooden Ark itself, <b>and one-half</b> a handbreadth <b>for the other wall.</b> Accordingly, <b>two handbreadths were left there, in which the Torah scroll</b> written by Moses <b>lay.</b>
What biblical source indicates that a Torah scroll was placed there? <b>As it is stated: “There was nothing in the Ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses put there”</b> (I Kings 8:9). <b>What</b> does <b>“there was nothing in the Ark except”</b> mean? This is an example of <b>a restriction following a restriction,</b> as both terms, “nothing” and “except,” indicate that the Ark was empty. <b>And</b> there is a hermeneutical principle that <b>a restriction following a restriction serv</b>es <b>only to amplify</b> and include other matters. In this case, it serves <b>to include a Torah scroll that lies in the Ark.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: With this explanation <b>you have accounted for the</b> entire <b>length of the Ark; go</b> now <b>and account for the width of the Ark,</b> which was nine handbreadths. <b>How much</b> space did <b>the tablets occupy</b> of the width <b>of the Ark,</b> which was nine handbreadths wide? <b>Six handbreadths;</b> therefore, <b>three handbreadths were left there</b> along the width of the Ark. <b>Deduct a handbreadth from them: One-half</b> a handbreadth <b>for</b> the thickness of <b>this wall and one-half</b> a handbreadth <b>for</b> the thickness of <b>the other wall.</b> Accordingly, <b>two handbreadths were left there.</b> What was their purpose? These were necessary <b>so that the Torah scroll would be able to go in and out without being pressed;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> The <b>cubit</b> used for all the measurements of the Ark <b>was five handbreadths</b> long. There-fore, the Ark was twelve and one-half handbreadths long, seven and one-half handbreadths wide, and seven and one-half handbreadths high. <b>And</b> as for <b>the tablets, their length was six</b> handbreadths, <b>their width was six</b> handbreadths, <b>and their thickness was three</b> handbreadths, and <b>they were placed along the length of the Ark,</b> one next to the other. If so, <b>how much</b> space did <b>the tablets occupy</b> along the length <b>of the Ark? Twelve handbreadths,</b> so that <b>one-half a handbreadth was left there,</b> which is two fingerbreadths. <b>One fingerbreadth</b> of those two was <b>for</b> the thickness of <b>this wall and one fingerbreadth</b> of those two was <b>for</b> the thickness of <b>the other wall.</b>
With this explanation, <b>you have accounted</b> for <b>the</b> entire <b>length of the Ark; go</b> now <b>and account for the width of the Ark,</b> which was seven and one-half handbreadths. <b>How much</b> space did <b>the tablets occupy in the Ark? Six handbreadths,</b> meaning that <b>one and one-half handbreadths were left there</b> along the width of the Ark. <b>Deduct one-half a handbreadth, one and one-half fingerbreadths for</b> the thickness of <b>this wall, and one and one-half fingerbreadths for</b> the thickness of <b>the other wall.</b> Accordingly, <b>one handbreadth was left there in which the</b> silver <b>columns were placed</b> on either side of the tablets, <b>as it is stated: “King Solomon made himself a palanquin of the timbers of Lebanon; he made its columns of silver, its back of gold, its seat of purple”</b> (Song of Songs 3:9–10). This is understood as an allusion to the Ark of the Covenant.
<b>And the chest in which the Philistines sent the gift to the God of Israel was placed alongside</b> the Ark, <b>as it is stated: “And put the golden devices which you are restoring to Him for a guilt-offering in a chest by the side of it, and send it away that it may go”</b> (I Samuel 6:8). <b>And upon</b> this chest <b>lay the Torah scroll, as it is stated: “Take this Torah scroll and put it at the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:26). This means that <b>it was placed at the side</b> of the Ark, <b>and not inside</b> it.
<b>And</b> accordingly, <b>how do I realize</b> the meaning of that which is stated: <b>“There was nothing in the Ark except</b> the two tablets of stone which Moses put there,” which, according to the opinion of Rabbi Meir, teaches that something else was in the Ark besides the tablets themselves? It serves <b>to include</b>

Daf 14b

<b>the broken pieces of the</b> first set of <b>tablets, which were placed in the Ark.</b> Having cited the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara now presents its objection to what was taught earlier with regard to the dimensions of a Torah scroll: <b>And if it should enter your mind</b> to say, as Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi held, that <b>the circumference of a Torah scroll is six handbreadths, now since any</b> cylindrical object <b>having a circumference of three handbreadths has a diameter of one handbreadth,</b> a Torah scroll with a circumference of six handbreadths has a diameter of two handbreadths. <b>And since</b> a Torah scroll <b>is wound to the middle,</b> since it is rolled from both sides, <b>it</b> must take up <b>more than two handbreadths</b> due to <b>the space between</b> the sheets of parchment and the double rolling. According to Rabbi Meir, who says that the Torah scroll was placed inside the ark, <b>how did</b> the scroll <b>fit in</b> the remaining <b>two handbreadths [<i>pushkei</i>]</b> of space in the Ark?
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said: The scroll of the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> which was kept in the Ark, <b>was wound to its beginning,</b> i.e., it had only a single pole, so that its circumference was only two handbreadths. The Gemara asks: <b>But still, how does</b> an item <b>that is two</b> handbreadths wide <b>fit into</b> a space that is precisely <b>two</b> handbreadths? It would be impossible to fit it in. <b>Rav Ashi said: A small section</b> of the scroll <b>was wound</b> separately <b>and</b> then <b>placed on top</b> of the scroll.
Having concluded its current discussion, the Gemara now addresses the details of the aforementioned <i>baraita</i> and asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who says that the Torah scroll rested on the chest that came from the Philistines, <b>where was the Torah scroll placed before the chest arrived?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>A shelf protruded from</b> the Ark <b>and the Torah scroll rested on it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who says that the Torah scroll rested inside the Ark, <b>what does he do with this</b> verse: “Take this Torah scroll and put it <b>at the side of the Ark”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:26)? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires</b> that verse to teach <b>that</b> the Torah scroll <b>was placed at the side</b> of the tablets, <b>and that it was not placed between</b> the two <b>tablets, but</b> it was <b>actually</b> placed <b>inside</b> the Ark <b>at the side</b> of the tablets.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Meir, where were the</b> silver <b>columns placed?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Outside</b> the Ark. The Gemara further asks: <b>And from where does Rabbi Meir</b> derive that <b>the broken pieces of the</b> first set of <b>tablets were placed in the Ark,</b> as the verse from which Rabbi Yehuda learns this: “There was nothing in the Ark except” (I Kings 8:9), is needed by Rabbi Meir to teach that the Torah scroll was placed there? The Gemara answers: <b>He derives</b> this point <b>from what Rav Huna</b> expounded, <b>as Rav Huna says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written:</b> “The Ark of God, <b>whereupon is called the Name, the name of the Lord of hosts that sits upon the cherubs”</b> (II Samuel 6:2)? The phrase “the name, the name of the Lord” <b>teaches that</b> both <b>the</b> second <b>tablets and the broken pieces of the</b> first set of <b>tablets were placed in the Ark.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>the other</b> Sage, i.e., Rabbi Yehuda, derive from this verse? The Gemara responds: <b>He requires</b> that text <b>for</b> that <b>which Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says:</b> This <b>teaches that the</b> ineffable <b>name</b> of God <b>and all of His appellations were placed in the Ark.</b>
The Gemara inquires: <b>And</b> doesn’t <b>the other</b> Sage, Rabbi Meir, <b>also require it for that?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so. Rather, from where does he</b> derive that <b>the broken pieces of the</b> first set of <b>tablets were placed in the Ark?</b> The Gemara expounds: <b>He derives</b> this <b>from</b> that <b>which Rav Yosef taught, as Rav Yosef taught</b> a <i>baraita</i>: The verses state: “At that time the Lord said to me: Hew for yourself two tablets of stone like the first…and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, <b>which you broke, and you shall put them</b> in the Ark” (Deuteronomy 10:1–2). <b>This teaches that</b> both <b>the</b> second set of <b>tablets and the broken pieces of the</b> first set of <b>tablets were placed in the Ark.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what does <b>the other</b> one, Rabbi Yehuda, learn from this verse? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for</b> that <b>which Reish Lakish</b> teaches, <b>as Reish Lakish says:</b> What is the meaning of that which is stated: “The first tablets, <b>which you broke [<i>asher shibbarta</i>]”?</b> These words allude to the fact that God approved of Moses’ action, as if <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: May your strength be straight [<i>yishar koḥakha</i>] because you broke</b> them.
§ <b>The Sages taught: The order of the</b> books of the <b>Prophets</b> when they are attached together is as follows: <b>Joshua and Judges, Samuel and Kings, Jeremiah and Ezekiel,</b> and <b>Isaiah and the Twelve</b> Prophets. The Gemara asks: <b>Consider: Hosea preceded</b> some of the other prophets whose books are included in the Bible, <b>as it is written: “The Lord spoke first to Hosea”</b> (Hosea 1:2). At first glance this verse is difficult: <b>But did God speak first with Hosea,</b> and not with any other prophet before him? <b>Weren’t there many prophets between Moses and Hosea? And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: He was the first of four prophets who prophesied in that period, and they were: Hosea and Isaiah, Amos and Micah.</b> Accordingly, Hosea preceded those three prophets; <b>and</b> the book of <b>Hosea</b> as well <b>should precede</b> the books of those prophets.
The Gemara answers: <b>Since his prophecy is written together with</b> those of <b>Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi</b> in one book of the Twelve Prophets, <b>and Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi were the last of the prophets, he is counted with them.</b> The Gemara inquires: <b>But let</b> the book of Hosea <b>be written separately and let it precede</b> the others. The Gemara answers: Were it written separately, <b>since it is small it would be lost.</b>
The Gemara further asks: <b>Consider: Isaiah preceded Jeremiah and Ezekiel; let</b> the book of <b>Isaiah precede</b> the books of those other prophets. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the book of <b>Kings ends with the destruction</b> of the Temple, <b>and</b> the book of <b>Jeremiah</b> deals <b>entirely with</b> prophecies of <b>the destruction, and</b> the book of <b>Ezekiel begins with the destruction</b> of the Temple <b>but ends with consolation</b> and the rebuilding of the Temple, <b>and Isaiah</b> deals <b>entirely with consolation,</b> as most of his prophecies refer to the redemption, <b>we juxtapose destruction to destruction and consolation to consolation.</b> This accounts for the order: Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Isaiah.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>The order of the Writings</b> is: <b>Ruth and the book of Psalms, and Job and Proverbs; Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, and Lamentations; Daniel and the Scroll of Esther;</b> and <b>Ezra and Chronicles.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>Job</b> lived <b>in the time of Moses, let</b> the book of <b>Job precede</b> the others. The Gemara answers: <b>We do not begin with suffering,</b> i.e., it is inappropriate to start the Writings with a book that deals so extensively with suffering. The Gemara asks: But the book of <b>Ruth,</b> with which the Writings opens, <b>is also</b> about <b>suffering,</b> since it describes the tragedies that befell the family of Elimelech. The Gemara answers: This is <b>suffering which has a future</b> of hope and redemption. <b>As Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Why was she named Ruth,</b> spelled <i>reish</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>tav</i>? Because there <b>descended from her David who sated,</b> a word with the root <i>reish</i>, <i>vav</i>, <i>heh</i>, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, with songs and praises.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> now considers the authors of the biblical books: <b>And who wrote</b> the books of the Bible? <b>Moses wrote his own book,</b> i.e., the Torah, <b>and the portion of Balaam</b> in the Torah, <b>and</b> the book of <b>Job. Joshua wrote his own book and eight verses in the Torah,</b> which describe the death of Moses. <b>Samuel wrote his own book,</b> the book of <b>Judges, and</b> the book of <b>Ruth. David wrote the book of Psalms by means of ten elders</b> of previous generations, assembling a collection that included compositions of others along with his own. He included psalms authored <b>by Adam the first</b> man, <b>by Melchizedek</b> king of Salem, <b>and by Abraham, and by Moses, and by Heman, and by Jeduthun, and by Asaph,</b>

Daf 15a

<b>and by the three sons of Korah.</b>
<b>Jeremiah wrote his own book, and the book of Kings, and Lamentations. Hezekiah and his colleagues wrote</b> the following, and <b>a mnemonic</b> to remember which books they wrote is <b><i>yod</i>, <i>mem</i>, <i>shin</i>, <i>kuf</i>: Isaiah [<i>Yeshaya</i>], Proverbs [<i>Mishlei</i>], Song of Songs [<i>Shir HaShirim</i>], and Ecclesiastes [<i>Kohelet</i>]. The members of the Great Assembly wrote</b> the following, and <b>a mnemonic</b> to remember these books is <b><i>kuf</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>dalet</i>, <i>gimmel</i>: Ezekiel [<i>Yeḥezkel</i> ], and the Twelve Prophets [<i>Sheneim Asar</i>], Daniel</b> [<b><i>Daniel</i></b> ], <b>and the Scroll of Esther [<i>Megillat Ester</i>]. Ezra wrote his own book and the genealogy of</b> the book of <b>Chronicles until his</b> period.
The Gemara comments: This <b>supports Rav, as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Ezra did not ascend from Babylonia</b> to Eretz Yisrael <b>until he established his own genealogy, and</b> after that he <b>ascended.</b> This genealogy is what is written in the book of Chronicles. <b>And who completed</b> the book of Chronicles for the generations following Ezra? <b>Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah.</b>
The Gemara elaborates on the particulars of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master said</b> above that <b>Joshua wrote his own book and eight verses of the Torah.</b> The Gemara comments: This <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught in accordance with the one who says that</b> it was <b>Joshua</b> who <b>wrote the</b> last <b>eight verses in the Torah.</b> This point is subject to a tannaitic dispute, <b>as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And Moses the servant of the Lord died there”</b> (Deuteronomy 34:5); <b>is it possible that</b> after <b>Moses died, he</b> himself <b>wrote “And Moses died there”? Rather, Moses wrote</b> the entire Torah <b>until this point,</b> and <b>Joshua wrote from this</b> point <b>forward;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. And some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Neḥemya</b> stated this opinion.
<b>Rabbi Shimon said to him: Is it possible</b> that the <b>Torah scroll was missing a single letter? But it is written: “Take this Torah scroll”</b> (Deuteronomy 31:26), indicating that the Torah was complete as is and that nothing further would be added to it. <b>Rather, until this point the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses repeated</b> after Him <b>and wrote</b> the text. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> with respect to Moses’ death, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, dictated and Moses wrote with tears.</b> The fact that the Torah was written by way of dictation can be seen <b>later, as it is stated</b> concerning the writing of the Prophets: <b>“And Baruch said to them: He dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them with ink in the scroll”</b> (Jeremiah 36:18).
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rabbi Yehoshua bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Giddel says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> When the Torah is read publicly in the synagogue, <b>one</b> person <b>reads the</b> last <b>eight verses in the Torah,</b> and that section may not be divided between two readers? <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>this is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> as according to Rabbi Shimon these verses are an integral part of the Torah, written by Moses just like the rest? The Gemara answers: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that this was said in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, since they differ</b> from the rest of the Torah in one way, as Moses wrote them with tears, <b>they differ</b> from the rest of the Torah in this way as well, i.e., they may not be divided between two readers.
It is stated in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Joshua wrote his own book.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written</b> toward the end of the book: <b>“And Joshua, son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died”</b> (Joshua 24:29)? Is it possible that Joshua wrote this? The Gemara answers: Aaron’s son <b>Eleazar completed it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it</b> also <b>written: “And Eleazar, son of Aaron, died”</b> (Joshua 24:33)? The Gemara answers: <b>Pinehas completed it.</b>
It is also stated in the <i>baraita</i> that <b>Samuel wrote his own book.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “And Samuel died”</b> (I Samuel 28:3)? The Gemara answers: <b>Gad the seer and Nathan the prophet finished it.</b>
It is further stated that <b>David wrote the book of Psalms by means of ten elders,</b> whom the <i>baraita</i> proceeds to list. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then <b>let it also count Ethan the Ezrahite</b> among the contributors to the book of Psalms, as it is he who is credited with Psalms, chapter 89. <b>Rav says: Ethan the Ezrahite is</b> the same person as <b>Abraham.</b> Proof for this is the fact that <b>it is written here:</b> “A Maskil of <b>Ethan the Ezrahite”</b> (Psalms 89:1), <b>and it is written there: “Who raised up one from the east [<i>mizraḥ</i>], whom righteousness</b> met wherever he set his foot” (Isaiah 41:2). The latter verse is understood as referring to Abraham, who came from the east, and for that reason he is called Ethan the Ezrahite in the former verse.
The Gemara asks: The <i>baraita</i> <b>counts Moses</b> among the ten elders whose works are included in the book of Psalms, <b>and it</b> also <b>counts Heman. But doesn’t Rav say:</b> The <b>Heman</b> mentioned in the Bible (I Kings 5:11) <b>is</b> the same person as <b>Moses?</b> This is proven by the fact that <b>it is written here: “Heman”</b> (Psalms 88:1), which is Aramaic for trusted, <b>and it is written there</b> about Moses: <b>“For he is the trusted one in all My house”</b> (Numbers 12:7). The Gemara answers: <b>There were two Hemans,</b> one of whom was Moses, and the other a Temple singer from among the descendants of Samuel.
The <i>baraita</i> further states that <b>Moses wrote his own book,</b> i.e., the Torah, <b>the portion of Balaam, and</b> the book of <b>Job. This supports Rabbi Levi bar Laḥma, as Rabbi Levi bar Laḥma says: Job</b> lived <b>in the time of Moses. It is written here</b> with regard to Job: <b>“Oh, that my words were written now [<i>eifo</i>]”</b> (Job 19:23), <b>and it is written there</b> in Moses’ words to God: <b>“For in what shall it be known here [<i>eifo</i>]”</b> (Exodus 33:16). The unusual use of the word <i>eifo</i> in these two places indicates that Job and Moses lived in the same generation.
The Gemara comments: <b>But</b> if that is the proof, <b>say</b> that Job lived <b>in the time of Isaac, as it is written</b> in connection with Isaac: <b>“Who then [<i>eifo</i>] is he that has taken venison”</b> (Genesis 27:33). <b>Or say</b> that he lived <b>in the time of Jacob, as it is written</b> with respect to Jacob: <b>“If it must be so now [<i>eifo</i>], do this”</b> (Genesis 43:11). <b>Or say</b> that he lived <b>in the time of Joseph, as it is written</b> with respect to Joseph: “Tell me, I pray you, <b>where [<i>eifo</i>] are they feeding their flocks?”</b> (Genesis 37:16).
The Gemara answers: It could <b>not enter your mind</b> to say this, <b>as it is written</b> in the continuation of the previously mentioned verse: <b>“Oh, that</b> my words <b>were inscribed [<i>veyuḥaku</i>] in a book”</b> (Job 19:23), <b>and it is Moses who is called the inscriber, as it is written</b> with regard to him: <b>“And he provided the first part for himself, for there was the inscriber’s [<i>meḥokek</i>] portion reserved”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:21).
<b>Rava says: Job</b> lived <b>at the time of the spies</b> whom Moses sent to scout the land of Canaan. This is proven by the fact that <b>it is written here: “There was a man in the land of Utz, whose name was Job”</b> (Job 1:1), <b>and it is written there</b> in the account of the spies: <b>“Whether there are trees [<i>eitz</i>] in it”</b> (Numbers 13:20). The Gemara asks: <b>Is it comparable? Here</b> the word that is used is <b><i>Utz</i>,</b> whereas <b>there</b> the word is <b><i>eitz</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This is what Moses said to Israel,</b> i.e., to the spies: <b>Is that man</b> named Job still alive, <b>he whose years are as long as</b> the years <b>of a tree and who protects his generation like a tree?</b> This is why the allusion to him here is through the word <i>eitz</i>, rather than <i>Utz</i>.
The Gemara relates that <b>one of the Sages sat before Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani and he sat and said: Job never existed and was never created;</b> there was never such a person as Job. <b>Rather,</b> his story <b>was a parable.</b> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani <b>said to him:</b> In rebuttal <b>to you, the verse states: “There was a man in the Land of Utz whose name was Job”</b> (Job 1:1), which indicates that such a man did indeed exist.
The Gemara asks: <b>But if that is so,</b> that the words “there was” prove that Job existed, what shall we say about the parable that Natan the prophet presented to David: “There were two men in one city; the one rich and the other poor. The rich man had very many flocks and herds, <b>but the poor man had nothing except one little lamb, which he had bought and reared”</b> (II Samuel 12:3)? <b>Was there</b> really such a person? <b>Rather, it was merely a parable; here too it is merely a parable.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that it is a parable, <b>why</b> state <b>his name and the name of his city?</b> Rather, Job was clearly a real person.
The Gemara cites another opinion with regard to the time when Job lived. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar both say: Job was among those who ascended from the exile</b> to Eretz Yisrael at the start of the Second Temple period, <b>and his house of study was in Tiberias.</b> The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from what is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The days of Job’s life</b> extended <b>from when Israel entered Egypt until they left,</b> indicating that this is the period during which he lived and not, as suggested, in the early days of the Second Temple.

Daf 15b

The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> means that the duration of Job’s life lasted as long <b>as from when Israel entered Egypt until when they left,</b> but not that he lived during that specific time frame.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from another <i>baraita</i> against the notion that Job was a Jew: <b>Seven prophets prophesied to the nations of the world, and they are: Balaam and his father</b> Beor, <b>and Job, Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and Elihu ben Barachel the Buzite,</b> which indicates that Job was not Jewish. <b>He said to him: And according to your reasoning</b> that Job could not have been Jewish because he prophesied to the nations of the world, <b>was Elihu ben Barachel not a Jew? Is it</b> not <b>written: “Of the family of Ram”</b> (Job 32:2), meaning Abraham?
<b>Rather,</b> one must explain that Elihu is included in this list because <b>he prophesied to the nations of the world;</b> and <b>so too</b> it may be maintained that <b>Job</b> is included in this list, even though he is Jewish, because he <b>prophesied to the nations of the world.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But did not all the</b> other <b>prophets</b> also <b>prophesy to the nations of the world?</b> Why then are only these seven mentioned? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to the other prophets, <b>their main prophecies were</b> directed <b>to Israel,</b> whereas <b>here,</b> with regard to these seven prophets, <b>their main prophecies were</b> directed <b>to the nations of the world.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from what is taught in a different <i>baraita</i>: <b>There was a</b> certain <b>pious man among the nations of the world and his name was Job, and he came into the world only to receive his reward. The Holy One, Blessed be He, brought afflictions upon him,</b> and <b>he began to blaspheme and curse. The Holy One, Blessed be He, doubled his reward in this world in order to expel him from the World-to-Come.</b> This <i>baraita</i> states that Job was not a Jew, but rather a gentile.
The Gemara responds: The matter of whether or not Job was Jewish <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the period during which Job lived: <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Job</b> lived <b>in the days of the judging of the Judges, as it is stated</b> in connection with Job: <b>“Behold, all you yourselves have seen it; why then have you become altogether vain?”</b> (Job 27:12). <b>Which generation was completely vain? You must say it was the generation of the judging of the Judges,</b> when the people judged the Judges, as will be explained shortly.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: Job</b> lived <b>in the days of Ahasuerus, as it is stated: “And in all the world were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job”</b> (Job 42:15). In <b>which generation were beautiful women sought? You must say it was the generation of Ahasuerus</b> (Esther, chapter 2). The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> it was <b>in the days of David, as it is written: “And they sought a beautiful maiden”</b> (I Kings 1:3)? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the time of David, they searched <b>“throughout the territory of Israel”</b> (I Kings 1:3), whereas <b>here,</b> in the time of <b>Ahasuerus,</b> they searched <b>throughout the world,</b> as is similarly stated with regard to Job’s daughters.
<b>Rabbi Natan says: Job</b> lived <b>in the days of the kingdom of Sheba, as it is stated: “And Sheba fell upon them, and took them away”</b> (Job 1:15). <b>And the Rabbis say: Job</b> lived <b>in the days of</b> the kingdom of <b>the Chaldeans</b> in the time of Nebuchadnezzar, <b>as it is stated: “The Chaldeans formed three bands”</b> (Job 1:17). <b>And some say</b> that <b>Job</b> lived <b>in the days of Jacob and</b> that <b>he married Dina, the daughter of Jacob.</b> As <b>it is written here: “You speak as one of the loathsome women speaks”</b> (Job 2:10), <b>and it is written there</b> in the account of the incident involving Dina: <b>“He has done a loathsome act in Israel”</b> (Genesis 34:7). This concludes the text of the <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara comments: <b>And all</b> these <b><i>tanna’im</i> hold that Job was a Jew except for</b> the opinion introduced with the phrase: <b>And some say,</b> according to which Job lived in the time of Jacob, and he was certainly not one of Jacob’s sons.
And what is the proof that all these <i>tanna’im</i> maintain that Job was Jewish? <b>As if it should enter your mind</b> to say that he came <b>from the nations of the world,</b> there is a difficulty: <b>After Moses died, did the Divine Presence rest</b> any longer <b>on the nations of the world? But doesn’t the Master say: Moses requested that the Divine Presence not rest</b> again <b>on the nations of the world, and</b> his request <b>was granted to him, as it is stated: “That we shall be differentiated, I and Your people,</b> from all the people that are upon the face of the earth” (Exodus 33:16), and it is stated there that God acceded to his request.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The generation of Job was awash in licentiousness, as it is stated: “Behold, all of you yourselves have seen [<i>ḥazitem</i>] it; why then have you become altogether vain?”</b> (Job 27:12), <b>and it is written: “Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look [<i>veneḥeze</i>] upon you”</b> (Song of Songs 7:1), which teaches that the phrase “you have seen it” connotes a licentious gaze. The Gemara asks: But <b>say</b> that the phrase “you yourselves have seen it” signifies <b>prophecy, as it is written: “The vision [<i>ḥazon</i>] of Isaiah ben Amoz”</b> (Isaiah 1:1). The Gemara answers: <b>If so, why do I</b> need the words: <b>“Why then have you become altogether vain”?</b> Rather, the reference must be to inappropriate licentious gazing.
<b>And</b> further, with regard to Rabbi Elazar’s statement in the <i>baraita</i> that the generation of the judging of the Judges was one of vanity, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And it happened in the days of the judging of the Judges”</b> (Ruth 1:1)? This indicates <b>a generation that judged its judges.</b> If a judge would <b>say to</b> the defendant standing before him: <b>Remove the splinter from between your eyes,</b> meaning rid yourself of some minor infraction, the defendant would <b>say to him: Remove the beam from between your eyes,</b> meaning you have committed far more severe sins. If the judge would <b>say to him: “Your silver is become dross”</b> (Isaiah 1:22), meaning your coins are counterfeit, the defendant would <b>say to him: “Your wine is mixed with water”</b> (Isaiah 1:22), meaning you yourself dilute your wine with water and sell it. Since nobody behaved in proper manner, the judges were unable to judge.
<b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Anyone who says that the queen of Sheba [<i>malkat Sheva</i>]</b> who came to visit King Solomon (see I Kings, chapter 10) <b>was a woman is nothing other than mistaken. What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>malkat</i> Sheba? The kingdom [<i>malkhuta</i>] of Sheba,</b> as is mentioned in Job: “And Sheba fell on them and took them away” (Job 1:15).
§ Having mentioned the book of Job, the Gemara addresses several matters relating to it. It is stated: <b>“Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and the Satan came also among them. And the Lord said to the Satan: From where do you come? And the Satan answered</b> the Lord, and said: From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking through it” (Job 1:6–7). The Satan <b>said to</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, I have gone to and fro throughout the entire world and I have not found anyone as faithful as Your servant Abraham, to whom You said: “Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to you”</b> (Genesis 13:17). <b>And even so, when he did not find a place to bury Sarah before he purchased</b> a burial site <b>for four hundred silver shekels, he did not find fault with Your ways</b> or complain about the fact that you had failed to fulfill Your promise.
<b>“And the Lord said to the Satan: Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on earth,</b> a perfect and upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil?” (Job 1:8). About this <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: That</b> which <b>is stated about Job is greater than that</b> which <b>is stated about Abraham. As with regard to Abraham it is written: “For now I know that you fear God”</b> (Genesis 22:12), <b>with regard to Job it is written: “A perfect and an upright man, one who fears God and turns away from evil”</b> (Job 1:8).
The Gemara clarifies the meaning of the aforementioned verse: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>“and turns away from evil”? Rabbi Abba bar Shmuel says: Job was forgiving with his money.</b> It is <b>the way of the world</b> that <b>one pays the storekeeper</b> for even <b>half-<i>peruta</i></b> of merchandise purchased from him. But if somebody bought an item of such little value from <b>Job,</b> he <b>would forgive him</b> his half-<i>peruta</i>.
The Gemara continues to clarify the verses concerning Job. <b>“Then the Satan answered the Lord, and said: Does Job fear God for naught? Have You not made a hedge about him, and about his house,</b> and about all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his cattle is increased in the land” (Job 1:9–10). <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>“You have blessed the work of his hands”? Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: Anyone who took a <i>peruta</i> from Job was blessed.</b> Not only was Job’s own handiwork blessed, but anybody who received anything from him was also blessed.
The Gemara continues with its explication of these verses. <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>“And his livestock is increased [<i>paratz</i>] in the land”</b> (Job 1:10)? <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says: Job’s livestock breached [<i>paretzu</i>] the order of the world.</b> It is <b>the way of the world</b> that <b>wolves kill goats,</b> but in the case of <b>Job’s livestock, the goats killed the wolves.</b>
The Gemara continues to relate the Satan’s challenge to God: <b>“But now put forth Your hand, and touch all that he has, and he will curse You to Your face. And the Lord said to the Satan: Behold, all that he has is in your power; only upon himself do not put forth your hand.</b> And the Satan went out from the presence of the Lord” (Job 1:11–12). The verses relate what then occurred: <b>“Now there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house, and there came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were plowing,</b> and the asses were feeding beside them” (Job 1:13–14). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>“The oxen were plowing and the asses were feeding beside them”? Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, gave Job a taste</b>

Daf 16a

<b>of the World-to-Come,</b> when plowing and harvesting will take place at the same time. Here too, the oxen plowed and the donkeys grazed on the crops that grew from that effort.
The Gemara continues to interpret verses from the book of Job. <b>“While he was yet speaking, there came also another and said: The fire of God</b> has fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them…<b>While he was yet speaking, there came also another and said: The Chaldeans formed three bands, and fell among the camels, and have carried them away,</b> and have slain the servants with the edge of the sword…<b>While he was yet speaking, there came also another and said: Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house; and, behold, there came a great wind from across the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men,</b> and they are dead…<b>Then Job arose, and rent his coat, and shaved his head,</b> and fell down on the ground and prostrated himself. <b>And he said: I came naked out of my mother’s womb, and naked I shall return there; the Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away, blessed be the name of the Lord. In all this Job sinned not, nor did he lay reproach on God”</b> (Job 1:16–22).
<b>“Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves</b> before the Lord, and the Satan came also among them to present himself before God. <b>And the Lord said to the Satan: From where do you come? And the Satan answered the Lord, and said: From going to and fro in the earth</b> and from walking up and down in it” (Job 2:1–2). The Satan <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, I have gone to and fro across the entire world and have not found anyone as faithful as your servant Abraham, to whom you said: “Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to you”</b> (Genesis 13:17). <b>And when he wanted to bury Sarah, he could not find a place to bury her, and</b> yet <b>he did not criticize Your ways,</b> or accuse You of having failed to keep Your promise.
About this it says: <b>“And the Lord said to the Satan: Have you considered My servant Job, that there is none like him on earth,</b> a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God and turns away from evil? <b>And still he holds fast to his integrity, although you moved Me against him, to destroy him without cause”</b> (Job 2:3).
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Were it not</b> explicitly <b>written in the verse, it would be impossible to say this,</b> as it would be insulting to God’s honor. The verse states: “You moved Me against him,” <b>like a person whom others persuade and</b> allows himself to be <b>persuaded,</b> as if God had not wanted to do anything, but allowed Himself to be persuaded to bring harm to Job.
<b>It was taught in a <i>baraita</i></b> with regard to the methods of the Satan: He <b>descends</b> to this world <b>and misleads</b> a person into sinning. He then <b>ascends</b> to Heaven, levels accusations against that very sinner, <b>and inflames</b> God’s <b>anger</b> against him. He then <b>receives permission</b> to act <b>and takes away the</b> sinner’s <b>soul</b> as punishment.
The Gemara returns to discuss the text of the book of Job: <b>“And the Satan answered the Lord, and said: Skin for skin, for all that a man has he will give for his life. But put forth Your hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse You to Your face. And the Lord said to the Satan: Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life. So the Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord, and smote Job</b> with vile sores from the sole of his foot to his crown” (Job 2:4–7). <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: Satan’s suffering was more difficult than that of Job.</b> This can be explained by means of <b>a parable involving a servant whose master said to him: Break the barrel but save its wine.</b> Here too, God told the Satan that he could do whatever he liked short of taking Job’s life, and that limitation caused Satan to suffer.
<b>Reish Lakish says: Satan, the evil inclination, and the Angel of Death are one,</b> that is, they are three aspects of the same essence. <b>He is the Satan</b> who seduces people and then accuses them, <b>as it is written: “So the Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord,</b> and smote Job with vile sores” (Job 2:7). <b>He is</b> also <b>the evil inclination,</b> as <b>it is written there:</b> “The impulse of the thoughts of his heart <b>was only evil continuously”</b> (Genesis 6:5); <b>and it is written here: “Only upon himself do not put forth your hand”</b> (Job 1:12). The verbal analogy between the various uses of the word “only” teaches that the evil inclination is to be identified with the Satan. <b>He is</b> also <b>the Angel of Death, as it is written: “Only spare his life”</b> (Job 2:6); <b>apparently</b> Job’s life <b>depends upon him,</b> the Satan, and accordingly the Satan must also be the Angel of Death.
<b>Rabbi Levi says:</b> Both <b>Satan,</b> who brought accusations against Job, <b>and Peninnah,</b> who tormented Hannah, mother of Samuel the prophet, acted with <b>intent</b> that was <b>for the sake of Heaven.</b> As for <b>Satan, when he saw that the Holy One, Blessed be He, inclined to</b> favor <b>Job</b> and praised him, <b>he said: Heaven forbid that He should forget the love of Abraham.</b> With regard to <b>Peninnah, as it is written: “And her rival wife also provoked her sore, to make her fret”</b> (I Samuel 1:6), i.e., Peninnah upset Hannah in order to motivate her to pray. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov taught</b> this <b>in Paphunya,</b> and <b>Satan came and kissed his feet</b> in gratitude for speaking positively about him.
The Gemara considers the character of Job. The verse states: <b>“In all this Job did not sin with his lips”</b> (Job 2:10). <b>Rava says:</b> A close reading of the verse indicates that <b>he did not sin with his lips,</b> but <b>he sinned in his heart. What did he say</b> that suggests that he had wicked thoughts? <b>“The earth is given into the hand of the wicked, he covers the faces of its judges; if not he, then who is it?”</b> (Job 9:24). <b>Rava says: Job sought to turn the bowl upside down,</b> that is to say, he alluded here to a heretical thought, as he said that the earth is given into the hand of the wicked, indicating that he had God in mind. <b>Abaye said to him: Job was referring</b> here <b>only to the Satan,</b> he being the wicked one into whose hands the land was given.
The Gemara comments: This is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.” Rabbi Eliezer says: Job sought to turn the bowl upside down; Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: Job was referring</b> here <b>only to the Satan.</b>
The Gemara continues to discuss Job’s statements: <b>“Although You know that I am not wicked, and there is none that can deliver out of Your hand”</b> (Job 10:7). <b>Rava says: Job sought to exempt the whole world from judgment,</b> claiming that all of a person’s actions are directed by God, and therefore one cannot be held culpable for his misdeeds. Job <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, You created the ox with split hooves,</b> making it kosher, and <b>You created the donkey with closed hooves,</b> making it forbidden; <b>You created the Garden of Eden,</b> and <b>You created Gehenna;</b> and similarly, <b>You created righteous people</b> and <b>You created wicked people; who can restrain You?</b> Seeing that You created people as either righteous or wicked, You cannot later complain about their actions.
<b>And how did Job’s friends answer him? “You do away with fear, and impair devotion before God”</b> (Job 15:4) with such statements. True, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, created the evil inclination,</b> but <b>He</b> also <b>created the Torah</b> as <b>an antidote</b> to counter its effects and prevent it from gaining control of a person.
<b>Rava interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written,</b> Job saying about himself: <b>“The blessing of him that was lost came upon me, and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy”</b> (Job 29:13). <b>“The blessing of him that was lost came upon me” teaches that</b> Job <b>used to steal a field from orphans,</b> cultivate it, <b>improve it, and</b> then <b>return it to them;</b> consequently, they would bless him for the field they had lost. <b>“I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy”</b> teaches that <b>anywhere that there was a widow whom no one would marry, he would go</b> and <b>cast his name upon her,</b> i.e., he would start a rumor that she was related to him, <b>and</b> then <b>somebody would</b> come forward and <b>marry her.</b>
Job further said: <b>“O that my vexation were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances”</b> (Job 6:2). <b>Rav says: Dust</b> should be put <b>in the mouth of Job,</b> meaning, he should not have spoken in such a manner, as if he were weighing his deeds against those of God; may one act as if he is in <b>a friendship with Heaven?</b> And similarly, Job said: <b>“There is no arbiter between us, who may lay his hand upon us both”</b> (Job 9:33). <b>Rav says: Dust</b> should be put <b>in the mouth of Job</b> for saying this; <b>is there a servant who rebukes his master?</b> Job also said: <b>“I have made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I look upon a virgin?”</b> (Job 31:1). <b>Rava says: Dust</b> should be put <b>in the mouth</b> of <b>Job</b> for saying this; <b>he</b> did not look <b>at other</b> women, but <b>Abraham did not even look at his own</b> wife, <b>as it is written: “Now I know that you are a beautiful woman”</b> (Genesis 12:11). One may learn <b>by inference that initially he did not know</b> how beautiful she was because he had not gazed at her.
Job further said: <b>“As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to the grave shall come up no more”</b> (Job 7:9). <b>Rava says: From here</b> it may be inferred <b>that Job denied the resurrection of the dead,</b> as he said that one who goes down to the grave will not come up and live again, just as a cloud that dissipates will not return. He also stated: <b>“He crushes me with a tempest, and multiplies my wounds without cause”</b> (Job 9:17). <b>Rabba says: Job blasphemed with</b> mention of <b>a tempest and he was answered with</b> mention of <b>a tempest.</b>
Rabba explains: <b>He blasphemed with</b> mention of <b>a tempest [<i>bise’ara</i>], as it is written: “He crushes me with a tempest.”</b> Job <b>said before</b> God: <b>Master of the Universe, perhaps a tempest passed before You and You confused <i>Iyov</i>,</b> Job, <b>with <i>oyev</i>,</b> enemy. <b>He was answered with</b> mention of <b>a tempest, as it is written: “Then the Lord answered Job out of the tempest, and said:</b> Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? <b>Gird up now your loins like a man, for I will demand of you and let me know your answer”</b> (Job 38:1–3).
What is the meaning of “out of the tempest”? God <b>said to him: I have created many hairs [<i>nimin</i>] on a person, and for each hair I created its own follicle</b> through which the hair is sustained, <b>so that two</b> hairs <b>should not draw from one follicle. As were two</b> hairs <b>to draw from one follicle, they would impair a man’s vision.</b> Now, if <b>I do not confuse one follicle with another, would I confuse <i>Iyov</i> with <i>oyev</i>?</b> The Hebrew word for tempest, <i>se’ara</i>, is phonetically identical to the Hebrew word for hair.
God further said to Job: <b>“Who has divided a channel [<i>te’ala</i>] for the torrent</b> of rain, or a path for the lightning of thunder”? (Job 38:25). <b>I have created many drops</b> of water <b>in the clouds, and for each drop I created its own channel, so that two drops should not emerge from the same channel. As were two drops to emerge from the same channel they would destroy the earth and it would not yield produce.</b> Now, if <b>I do not confuse one drop with another, would I confuse <i>Iyov</i> with <i>oyev</i>?</b> Incidentally, the Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> term <b><i>te’ala</i></b> means <b>a channel? Rabba bar Sheila said: As it is written</b> with regard to Elijah the prophet: <b>“And he fashioned a channel [<i>te’ala</i>]</b> about the altar, <b>as</b> great as would contain <b>two <i>se’a</i> of seed”</b> (I Kings 18:32).
The second half of the aforementioned verse in Job states: <b>“Or a path for the lightning of thunder,”</b> which is interpreted as follows: God said: <b>I have created many thunderclaps in the clouds, and for each and every thunderclap I created its own path, so that two thunderclaps should not issue forth from the same path. As were two thunderclaps to issue from the same path, they would destroy the world.</b> Now, <b>if I do not confuse one thunderclap with another, would I confuse <i>Iyov</i> with <i>oyev</i>?</b>
It is further stated there: <b>“Do you know when the wild goats of the rock give birth? Can you mark when the hinds do calve?”</b> (Job 39:1). <b>This goat is cruel to her young</b> and shows them no pity; <b>when she squats</b>

Daf 16b

<b>to give birth she ascends to the top of a mountain so that</b> the kid <b>should fall down from her and die. And I summon her an eagle that receives it with his wings and places it before her; and if</b> the eagle <b>reached</b> her <b>one moment early or was one moment late,</b> the kid <b>would immediately die.</b> Now, if <b>I do not confuse one moment with another moment, would I confuse <i>Iyov</i> with <i>oyev</i>?</b>
Similarly: <b>“Can you mark when the hinds do calve?”</b> (Job 39:1). <b>The womb of this hind is narrow,</b> which makes for a difficult delivery. <b>When she squats to give birth, I summon her a snake [<i>derakon</i>] that bites her at the opening of the womb, which</b> then <b>becomes loose, and she gives birth, and if</b> the snake <b>reached</b> her <b>one moment early or was one moment late, she would immediately die.</b> Now, if I <b>do not confuse one moment with another moment, would I confuse <i>Iyov</i> with <i>oyev</i>?</b>
The Gemara comments: On the one hand, the text states: <b>“Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom”</b> (Job 34:35). <b>But</b> on the other hand, <b>it is written</b> with regard to Job’s friends: <b>“You have not spoken of Me the thing that is right, like my servant Job”</b> (Job 42:8). <b>Rava said: From here</b> it may be inferred <b>that a person is not held responsible</b> for what he says <b>when he is in distress.</b> Although Job uttered certain words that were wrong and inappropriate, he was not punished for them because he said them at a time of pain and hardship.
The verse states: <b>“And Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him”</b> (Job 2:11). <b>What</b> does <b>“they had made an appointment together”</b> mean? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: This</b> phrase <b>teaches that they all entered</b> through <b>one gate</b> at the same time. <b>And</b> a Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There were <b>three hundred parasangs between each and every one</b> of them, i.e., each one lived three hundred parasangs away from the other.
The Gemara asks: <b>How did they</b> all <b>know</b> at the same time what had happened to Job so that the three of them came together? <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>they</b> each <b>had a crown</b> which displayed certain signs when something happened to one of the others. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say they</b> each <b>had trees and when</b> the trees <b>withered they knew</b> that sorrow had visited one of them. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> closeness between Job and his friends explains the adage <b>that people say: Either a friend like the friends of Job or death.</b> If a person lacks close friends, he is better off dead.
The Gemara cites another place where Job is mentioned. <b>“And it came to pass, when men began to multiply [<i>larov</i>] on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them”</b> (Genesis 6:1). <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> <i>Larov</i> means that <b>propagation [<i>reviyya</i>] came to the world</b> through these daughters. <b>Reish Lakish says: Strife [<i>meriva</i>] came to the world.</b> Once daughters were born, the men began to fight among themselves over them. <b>Reish Lakish said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: According to you who say</b> that due to the daughters <b>propagation came to the world, for what</b> reason <b>were</b> the number of <b>Job’s daughters not doubled,</b> when at the end of the story God doubled everything that Job had lost (see Job 1:3, 42:12)?
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Granted,</b> the numbers of Job’s daughters <b>were not doubled in name,</b> meaning they did not become twice as many, <b>but they were doubled in beauty, as it is written: “He had also seven sons and three daughters. And he called the name of the first Jemimah, and the name of the second was Keziah, and the name of the third one was Keren-happuch”</b> (Job 42:13–14). All three names relate to the daughters’ beauty.
<b>Jemimah [<i>Yemima</i>];</b> in her beauty <b>she was similar to the day [<i>yom</i>]. Keziah; her scent wafted like</b> the <b>cassia [<i>ketzia</i>]</b> tree. <b>Keren-happuch; in the school of Rav Sheila they say: She was similar to the horn [<i>keren</i>] of a <i>keresh</i>,</b> an animal whose horns are particularly beautiful. <b>They laughed at this in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, since it is considered <b>a blemish</b> when a person resembles <b>the horn of a <i>keresh</i>. Rather, Rav Ḥisda said:</b> She was <b>like garden saffron [<i>kekurkema derishka</i>],</b> which is the best <b>of its kind.</b> <i>Keren</i> refers to a garden, and <i>pukh</i> means ornament, <b>as it is stated: “Though you enlarge</b> your eyes <b>with paint [<i>pukh</i>],</b> you beautify yourself in vain” (Jeremiah 4:30).
It is reported that <b>a daughter was born to Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, and <b>he was upset</b> that he did not have a son. <b>His father said to him: Propagation has come to the world</b> through the birth of a daughter. <b>Bar Kappara said to</b> Rabbi Shimon: <b>Your father has consoled you with meaningless consolation, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The world cannot endure without males and females,</b> as both are needed for the perpetuation of humanity. <b>But fortunate is he whose children are males and woe to him whose children are females.</b> Similarly, <b>the world cannot endure without either a spice dealer</b> whose wares are sweet-smelling, <b>or a tanner [<i>bursi</i>],</b> who is engaged in a foul-smelling occupation. <b>Fortunate is he whose occupation is a spice seller,</b> and <b>woe to him whose occupation is a tanner.</b>
The Gemara comments that this disagreement is <b>parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>:</b> The Torah states: <b>“And the Lord blessed Abraham with everything [<i>bakkol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 24:1), and the Sages disagree about <b>what <i>bakkol</i></b> means. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The blessing is <b>that he did not have a daughter. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> On the contrary, the blessing was <b>that he had a daughter. Others say: Abraham had a daughter and her name was Bakkol. Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i says: Abraham our forefather was so knowledgeable in astrology [<i>itztagninut</i>] that all the kings of the East and the West would come early to his door</b> due to his wisdom. This is the blessing of <i>bakkol</i>, that he possessed knowledge that everybody needed. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says: A precious stone hung around the neck of Abraham our forefather; any sick person who looked at it would immediately be healed. When Abraham our forefather died, the Holy One, Blessed be He, hung</b> this stone <b>from the sphere of the sun,</b> which from that point on brought healing to the sick. <b>Abaye said: This</b> explains the adage <b>that people say: As the day progresses, sickness is lifted.</b>
<b>Alternatively,</b> what is the blessing of <i>bakkol</i>? <b>That Esau did not rebel in</b> Abraham’s <b>lifetime,</b> that is to say, as long as Abraham lived Esau did not sin. <b>Alternatively,</b> the blessing of <i>bakkol</i> is <b>that Ishmael repented in</b> Abraham’s <b>lifetime.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>From where do we</b> derive that <b>Esau did not rebel in</b> Abraham’s <b>lifetime? As it is written:</b> “And Jacob was cooking a stew <b>and Esau came in from the field and he was faint”</b> (Genesis 25:29), <b>and</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>taught: On that day Abraham our forefather passed away, and Jacob our forefather prepared a lentil stew to comfort Isaac, his father,</b> as it was customary to serve mourners lentil stew.
The Gemara explains: <b>And what is different about lentils</b> that they in particular are the fare customarily offered to mourners? <b>They say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rabba bar Mari: Just as this lentil has no mouth,</b> i.e., it does not have a crack like other legumes, <b>so too a mourner has no mouth,</b> that is, his anguish prevents him from speaking. <b>Alternatively, just as this lentil is</b> completely <b>round, so too mourning comes around to the inhabitants of the world.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the two explanations? The Gemara answers: <b>There is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> with regard to whether it is appropriate <b>to console</b> a mourner <b>with eggs,</b> which have no opening but are not completely round.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: That wicked</b> Esau <b>committed five transgressions on that day</b> that Abraham died: <b>He engaged in sexual intercourse with a betrothed maiden, he killed a person, he denied the principle</b> of God’s existence, <b>he denied resurrection of the dead, and he despised the birthright.</b>
The Gemara cites proofs to support these charges. <b>He engaged in sexual intercourse with a betrothed maiden,</b> as <b>it is written here: “And Esau came in from the field”; and it is written there</b> with regard to rape of a betrothed maiden: <b>“For he found her in a field”</b> (Deuteronomy 22:27). <b>He killed a person,</b> as <b>it is written here:</b> “And he was <b>faint”; and it is written there: “Woe is me, for my soul faints before the slayers”</b> (Jeremiah 4:31). <b>And he denied the principle</b> of God’s existence, as <b>it is written here: “What profit is this to me”</b> (Genesis 25:32); <b>and it is written there: “This is my God and I will glorify Him”</b> (Exodus 15:2). When he questioned the profit of “this,” he was challenging the assertion that “this is my God.” <b>And he denied resurrection of the dead, as it is written: “Behold, I am at the point of death”</b> (Genesis 25:32), indicating that he did not believe in resurrection after death. <b>And he despised the birthright, as it is written: “And Esau despised the birthright”</b> (Genesis 25:34).
<b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that Ishmael repented in</b> Abraham’s <b>lifetime? From</b> the incident involving <b>Ravina and Rav Ḥama bar Buzi,</b> who <b>were sitting before Rava, and Rava was dozing</b> while they were talking. <b>Ravina said to Rav Ḥama bar Buzi: Is it true that you say</b> that <b>any death with regard to which</b> the word <b><i>gevia</i>,</b> expire, is mentioned <b>is the death of the righteous?</b> Rav Ḥama bar Buzi <b>said to him: Yes.</b> For example: “And Isaac expired [<i>vayyigva</i>], and died” (Genesis 35:29). Ravina objected: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the generation of the flood</b> it states: “And all flesh expired [<i>vayyigva</i>]” (Genesis 7:21), and there they died for their wickedness. Rav Ḥama bar Buzi <b>said to him: We say</b> this only when both <b><i>gevia</i> and <i>asifa</i>,</b> gathering, are used; when these two terms are mentioned together they indicate the death of a righteous person.
Ravina asked: <b>But isn’t there Ishmael, about whom <i>gevia</i> and <i>asifa</i> are written,</b> as it is stated: “And these are the years of the life of Yishmael…and he expired and died [<i>vayyigva vayyamot</i>]; and was gathered to his people” (Genesis 25:17)? <b>Meanwhile Rava,</b> who had heard the discussion in his dozed state, fully <b>awoke</b> and <b>said to them: Children [<i>dardekei</i>], this is what Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Ishmael repented in the lifetime of his father, as it is stated: “And Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him”</b> (Genesis 25:9). The fact that Ishmael allowed Isaac to precede him demonstrates that he had repented and accepted his authority.
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps</b> the verse <b>listed them in the order of their wisdom;</b> that is to say, perhaps in fact Ishmael preceded Isaac but the Torah did not list them in that order. The Gemara answers: <b>But if that is so,</b> consider that the verse states: <b>“And Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him”</b> (Genesis 35:29). <b>What is the reason</b> that the verse there <b>did not list them in the order of their wisdom? Rather, since</b> Ishmael <b>allowed</b> Isaac <b>to precede him,</b> it is clear that he <b>made</b> Isaac <b>his leader, and since he made him his leader, learn from it that he repented in</b> Abraham’s <b>lifetime.</b>
Incidental to the discussion of the verse “And God blessed Abraham with everything” (Genesis 24:1), the Gemara states that <b>the Sages taught:</b> There were <b>three</b> people <b>to whom the Holy One, Blessed be He, gave</b> already <b>in this world</b>

Daf 17a

<b>a taste of the World-to-Come. They are: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Abraham, as it is written with regard to him:</b> “And the Lord blessed Abraham <b>with everything”</b> (Genesis 24:1). <b>Isaac, as it is written with regard to him:</b> “And I have eaten <b>from everything”</b> (Genesis 27:33). <b>Jacob, as it is written with regard to him:</b> “Because I have <b>everything”</b> (Genesis 33:11). This teaches that already in their lifetimes they merited everything, i.e., perfection.
There were <b>three</b> people <b>over whom the evil inclination had no sway. They are: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as it is written</b> with regard <b>to them,</b> respectively: <b>“With everything,” “from everything,” “everything.”</b> The completeness of their blessings means that they did not have to contend with their evil inclinations. <b>And some say</b> that <b>even David</b> was not subject to his evil inclination, <b>as it is written: “And my heart has died within me”</b> (Psalms 109:22), meaning that the evil inclination in his heart was nullified as if his heart had died. <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> authority, who does not include David in his list, explain this verse? <b>He is mentioning his travails.</b> David means to say that his heart died within him owing to all the suffering that he endured, but he says nothing about his evil inclination.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> There were <b>six</b> people <b>over whom the Angel of Death had no sway</b> in their demise, <b>and they are: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as it is written</b> with regard <b>to them,</b> respectively: <b>“With everything,” “from everything,” “everything”;</b> since they were blessed with everything they were certainly spared the anguish of the Angel of Death. <b>Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, as it is written</b> with regard <b>to them</b> that they died <b>“by the mouth of the Lord”</b> (Numbers 33:38; Deuteronomy 34:5), which indicates that they died with a kiss, and not at the hand of the Angel of Death.
The Gemara asks: <b>But with regard to Miriam it is not written: “By the mouth of the Lord.” Rabbi Elazar says: Miriam also died with a kiss, as this is learned</b> through a verbal analogy between the word <b>“there”</b> mentioned in regard to Miriam: “And Miriam died there” (Numbers 20:1), and the word <b>“there”</b> mentioned in regard <b>to Moses:</b> “And Moses died there” (Deuteronomy 34:5). <b>And for what</b> reason <b>is “by the mouth of the Lord” not stated with</b> regard to <b>her? It is unseemly to mention</b> death by a kiss with regard to a woman.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> There were <b>seven</b> people <b>over whom the worm and the maggot had no sway, and they are: Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Moses, Aaron and Miriam, and Benjamin, son of Jacob. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as it is written with regard to them,</b> respectively: <b>“With everything,” “from everything,” “everything.” Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, as it is written with regard to them: “By the mouth of the Lord”; Benjamin, son of Jacob, as it is written: “And to Benjamin he said: The beloved of the Lord, he shall dwell in safety by Him”</b> (Deuteronomy 33:12). Even in death, he rests securely, unbothered by worms. <b>And some say</b> that <b>even David</b> is included, <b>as it is written: “My flesh also dwells secure”</b> (Psalms 16:9). The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how does <b>the other</b> authority, who does not include David, explain this? The Gemara answers: <b>He is asking for mercy,</b> that his flesh should dwell secure and not be subject to worms and maggots, but his request was denied.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There were <b>four</b> people <b>who died</b> only <b>because of the counsel of the</b> primordial <b>snake,</b> in the wake of which all of humanity became mortal, and not on account of any personal sin. <b>And they are: Benjamin, son of Jacob; Amram, father of Moses; Yishai, father of David; and Chileab, son of David. And all of these are known through tradition except for Yishai, father of David, with regard to</b> whom <b>it is written explicitly: “And Absalom placed Amasa over the army instead of Joab, and Amasa was the son of a man whose name was Ithra the Israelite, who engaged in intercourse with Abigail, daughter of Nahash, the sister of Zeruiah, mother of Joab”</b> (II Samuel 17:25). <b>But was</b> Abigail <b>the daughter of Nahash? Was she not the daughter of Yishai, as it is written: “And their sisters were Zeruiah and Abigail”</b> (I Chronicles 2:16)? <b>Rather,</b> she was called “daughter of Nahash” to indicate that <b>she was the daughter of one who died</b> only <b>because of the counsel of the snake.</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person may not dig a pit close to the pit of another,</b> in order to avoid damaging the latter’s pit. <b>And</b> similarly, one <b>may not</b> dig <b>a ditch, nor a cave,</b> i.e., a covered pit, <b>nor a water channel, nor a launderer’s pond,</b> which is a pit used for washing clothes, <b>unless he distanced</b> all of these <b>three handbreadths from the wall of another and he plasters lime</b> on the place where there is water.
<b>And one must distance the solid residue</b> of produce that has been pressed free of its oil, e.g., the refuse of olives from which oil has been squeezed, <b>and</b> animal <b>manure, and salt, and lime, and rocks three handbreadths from the wall of another,</b> as all these items produce heat and can damage the wall. <b>Or, alternatively, he</b> may <b>plaster</b> the wall <b>with lime</b> to prevent damage. <b>One must</b> likewise <b>distance seeds,</b> i.e., one may not plant seeds, <b>and</b> one may not operate <b>the plow, and</b> one must eliminate <b>urine, three handbreadths from the wall</b> of another.
The mishna continues: <b>And one must distance a mill</b> from a neighbor’s wall by <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>from the lower stone</b> of the mill, <b>which is four</b> handbreadths <b>from the</b> smaller <b>upper stone</b> of the mill. <b>And</b> there must be a distance of <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>from the</b> protruding <b>base [<i>hakalya</i>]</b> of <b>an oven</b> until the wall, <b>which is four</b> handbreadths <b>from the</b> narrow <b>upper rim [<i>hassafa</i>]</b> of the oven.

Daf 17b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>opens by</b> speaking of <b>a pit:</b> A person may not dig a pit close to the pit of another, <b>and</b> yet <b>he ends with</b> a reference to <b>a wall:</b> Unless he distances it from the wall of another. <b>Let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teach: Unless he distanced</b> his pit or ditch <b>three handbreadths from the pit of another,</b> just as he begins his statement by referring to a pit. Why does the mishna suddenly mention a wall here?
<b>Abaye said, and some say it was Rav Yehuda</b> who said: <b>We learned</b> that the mishna means: <b>From the wall of his pit.</b> In other words, one should read the mishna as follows: Unless he distanced his pit or ditch three handbreadths from the wall of another’s pit. The neighbor also built his pit close to the border between the two properties, and the mishna is teaching that the one digging a pit must distance it three handbreadths from the wall of the pit of the other.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> even so, <b>let it teach: Unless he distanced</b> his excavations <b>three handbreadths from the pit of another,</b> and one would understand that the term pit is referring to the wall of the other’s pit. The Gemara responds: By using the phrase: From the wall of another, <b>this teaches us</b> incidentally <b>that the wall of a pit</b> must be at least <b>three handbreadths</b> thick, as the wall of the other’s pit occupied the full three handbreadths between the cavity of his pit and the property of his neighbor. The practical <b>difference</b> of this observation is <b>with regard to buying and selling, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says to another: I am selling you a pit and its walls, the wall</b> of the pit <b>must be</b> at least <b>three handbreadths</b> thick.
§ <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who comes to</b> dig any of these excavations or <b>place</b> any of the items listed in the mishna <b>close to the boundary</b> of his field, where his neighbor currently has no pit, <b>Abaye says: He may</b> dig or <b>place</b> them <b>close</b> to the boundary; <b>and Rava says: He may not</b> dig or <b>place</b> them <b>close</b> to the boundary. The Gemara explains: <b>All agree that he may not</b> dig or <b>place</b> them <b>close</b> to <b>a field</b> of his neighbor if <b>that</b> field <b>is designated for</b> digging <b>pits,</b> as he will thereby restrict his neighbor from using his field in the manner it is expected to be used. <b>When they disagree</b> it is <b>with regard to a field that is not designated for</b> digging <b>pits.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Abaye says: He may</b> dig these excavations or <b>place</b> these items <b>close</b> to the boundary, <b>as</b> the neighbor’s field <b>is not designated for pits,</b> so he is not causing any damage by doing so. <b>Rava says: He may not</b> dig these excavations or <b>place</b> these items <b>close</b> to the boundary, <b>as</b> the neighbor can <b>say to him: Just as you changed your mind and dug</b> a pit, <b>I too</b> might <b>change my mind and dig</b> a pit, and I will no longer be able to dig near my border if you dig your pit close to the boundary.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of this discussion: <b>All agree</b> that <b>one may</b> dig these excavations or <b>place</b> these items <b>close</b> to the boundary of <b>a field that is not designated for</b> digging <b>pits. When they disagree</b> it is <b>with regard to a field that is designated for</b> digging <b>pits. Abaye says: One may</b> dig these excavations or <b>place</b> these items <b>close</b> to the boundary; and this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say</b> in the mishna (25b): <b>One must distance a tree twenty-five cubits from a cistern,</b> lest the roots of the tree grow and damage a neighbor’s cistern in his field. The difference is that <b>there it</b> is prohibited, <b>as when he plants</b> the tree <b>there is</b> already <b>a cistern. But here,</b> at the time <b>when he digs</b> his cistern, <b>there is</b> as yet <b>no cistern</b> in his neighbor’s field.
<b>And Rava says:</b> One <b>may not</b> dig these excavations or <b>place</b> these items <b>close</b> to the boundary; and this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who says</b> in that same mishna: <b>This one may dig in his</b> field <b>and that one may plant in his</b> field, i.e., one need not distance his tree for fear of damaging his neighbor’s field through expanding roots. The reason that Rava maintains that his ruling is correct even according to the opinion of Rabbi Yosei is that <b>this matter</b> applies only <b>there, as when he plants</b> the tree, <b>its roots, which</b> might <b>damage the cistern, are not</b> yet present. Consequently, when he plants he does not cause any damage. <b>But here,</b> the neighbor can <b>say to him: Each and every strike of yours with the hoe loosens my earth,</b> and therefore you are already causing damage as you dig your cistern.
The Gemara suggests a proof: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>a person may not dig a pit close to the pit of another,</b> unless he does so at a distance of three handbreadths from his neighbor’s wall. The Gemara analyzes this statement: Apparently, the <b>reason</b> he may not dig close to the boundary of his neighbor’s field <b>is that there is a pit</b> there, from which it may be inferred that if <b>there is no pit he</b> may dig his pit <b>close</b> to his neighbor’s wall. <b>Granted, according to that</b> second <b>version</b> of the dispute, <b>in which you said: All agree</b> that <b>one may</b> dig these excavations or <b>place</b> these items <b>close</b> to the boundary of <b>a field that is not designated for</b> digging <b>pits,</b> one can explain that <b>the mishna</b> is referring <b>to a field that is not designated for</b> digging <b>pits.</b>
<b>But</b> according <b>to that</b> first <b>version</b> of the dispute, <b>in which you said</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to a field that is not designated for</b> digging <b>pits,</b> there is a difficulty. <b>Granted,</b> this <b>works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye,</b> who says that one may dig one’s pit near the boundary when the neighbor has no pit. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava,</b> who maintains that it is prohibited to dig a pit near the boundary under any circumstances, the ruling of this mishna is <b>difficult.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you: Wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Abaye says, and some say it was Rav Yehuda</b> who says: <b>We learned</b> that the mishna means: <b>From the wall of his pit?</b> This indicates that the neighbor must distance the edge of his pit from the boundary by the thickness of his wall, which is three handbreadths. Therefore, even according to the ruling of the mishna, one may not dig his pit directly adjacent to the boundary.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> this discussion in the form of a challenge to the opinion of Abaye. The mishna teaches that one must distance his pit from that of his neighbor, <b>and it was stated with regard to that</b> ruling that <b>Abaye says, and some say it was Rav Yehuda</b> who says: <b>We learned</b> that it means: <b>From the wall of his pit.</b> In other words, the edge of the neighbor’s pit must be three handbreadths away from the boundary. <b>Granted, according to that</b> first <b>version</b> of the dispute, <b>in which you said: All agree that he may not</b> dig or <b>place</b> them <b>close</b> to <b>a field</b> of his neighbor if <b>that</b> field <b>is designated for</b> digging <b>pits,</b> one can explain that <b>the mishna</b> is referring <b>to a field that is designated for</b> digging <b>pits.</b>
<b>But according to that</b> second <b>version</b> of the dispute, <b>in which you said</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to a field that is designated for</b> digging <b>pits,</b> there is a difficulty. <b>Granted,</b> this <b>works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava,</b> who says that it is prohibited to dig a pit near the boundary in this case. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye,</b> the ruling of this mishna is <b>difficult,</b> as if the mishna is referring to the wall of the neighbor’s pit, this indicates that the first pit was dug close to the boundary.
The Gemara explains: <b>Abaye</b> could have <b>said to you: The mishna</b> is referring to the specific case <b>where</b> both neighbors <b>came to</b> dig their <b>pits at the same time.</b> Consequently, they must both distance their pits from one another. If there is no pit as yet next to the boundary, and the neighbor is not digging at that point, one may dig his pit alongside the boundary.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>rock that</b> is so soft that it <b>crumbles in</b> one’s <b>hands,</b> and no tool is needed, <b>this one may dig his pit from here, and that one may dig his pit from there. This one distances</b> his pit <b>three handbreadths and plasters with lime, and that one distances</b> his pit <b>three handbreadths and plasters with lime.</b> This indicates that the first one who digs a pit must distance his pit even when the second one does not yet have a pit. The Gemara rejects this proof: Rock that <b>crumbles in</b> one’s <b>hands is different.</b> In this case, one must maintain a distance from the boundary due to the softness of the ground.
The Gemara is puzzled by this exchange: <b>And he who asked it, why did he ask it?</b> The <i>baraita</i> is explicitly referring to rock that crumbles in one’s hands, so this is clearly a unique case. The Gemara answers that the Sage who asked the question assumed that the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> includes all types of soil, and he thought that <b>it was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to mention the specific example of rock that <b>crumbles in</b> one’s <b>hands,</b> as it could <b>enter your mind to say that since</b> this substance <b>crumbles in</b> one’s <b>hands he is required</b> to keep his pit at an even <b>greater distance.</b> To counter this, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that a distance of three handbreadths is sufficient.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: <b>One must distance the solid residue</b> of produce that has been pressed free of its oil, <b>and</b> animal <b>manure, and</b>

Daf 18a

<b>salt, and lime, and rocks three handbreadths from the wall of another, or he</b> can <b>plaster</b> the wall <b>with lime.</b> The Gemara analyzes this statement: The <b>reason</b> for this ruling <b>is that there is a wall</b> there belonging to his neighbor, from which it may be inferred that if <b>there is no wall</b> there, <b>one may place</b> these substances <b>close</b> to the boundary of his neighbor’s courtyard. This presents a difficulty for the opinion of Rava according to the first version of the dispute, which states that one may not place these substances close to a boundary even in the case of a field that is not designated for pits.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No,</b> even <b>if there is no wall one may also not place</b> these substances <b>close</b> to the boundary. The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what does</b> mentioning a wall here <b>teach us?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us that</b> all <b>these</b> substances <b>are damaging to a wall.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from the mishna: <b>One must distance seeds, and the plow, and urine three handbreadths from the wall</b> of another. The Gemara analyzes this ruling: The <b>reason</b> for this ruling <b>is that there is a wall,</b> from which it may be inferred that if <b>there is no wall, one may place</b> these substances <b>close</b> to the boundary of the field. The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>No,</b> even <b>if there is no wall, one may also not place</b> these substances <b>close</b> by the boundary. The Gemara asks: <b>But rather, what does</b> this <b>teach us?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us that dampness [<i>dimtunta</i>] is damaging to a wall.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from the mishna: <b>And</b> one must distance <b>a mill</b> from a wall by <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>from the lower stone</b> of the mill, <b>which is four</b> handbreadths <b>from the upper stone.</b> The Gemara analyzes this statement: The <b>reason</b> for this ruling <b>is that there is a wall,</b> from which it may be inferred that if <b>there is no wall, one may place</b> a mill <b>close</b> by the boundary. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No,</b> even <b>if there is no wall, one may also not place</b> his mill <b>close</b> by the boundary. The Gemara asks: <b>But rather, what does</b> this <b>teach us?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us that vibrations are damaging to a wall.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from the mishna: <b>And the oven</b> must be distanced <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>from the base, which is four</b> handbreadths <b>from the upper rim</b> of the oven. The Gemara analyzes this statement: The <b>reason</b> for this ruling <b>is that there is a wall,</b> from which it may be inferred that if <b>there is no wall, one may place</b> an oven <b>close</b> by the boundary. The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>No,</b> even <b>if there is no wall, one may also not place</b> his oven <b>close</b> by the boundary. The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what does</b> this <b>teach us?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us that heat is damaging to a wall.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna (20b): <b>A person may not open a bakery or a dye shop beneath</b> the wine <b>storeroom of another, nor may one</b> open <b>a cattle barn</b> there. The Gemara analyzes this mishna: The <b>reason</b> for this ruling <b>is that there is a storeroom</b> already in place, from which it may be inferred that <b>if there is no storeroom one may do</b> so. If this is the case, then with regard to a pit as well, one may dig next to a boundary if there is as yet no pit.
The Gemara answers: The case of <b>a residence is different,</b> as in general one can use his domicile in any manner of his choosing unless he directly causes damage to another or his property. The Gemara adds: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as</b> an explicit <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught with regard to that</b> mishna: <b>If</b> the construction of <b>the cattle barn preceded the storeroom,</b> it is <b>permitted.</b> Nothing can be inferred from the case of the <i>baraita</i> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna, which does not concern living quarters.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (26a): <b>A person may not plant a tree close to</b> another’s <b>field unless he distances it four cubits from</b> his neighbor. <b>And it is taught with regard to this</b> mishna: The <b>four cubits of</b> which the Sages <b>spoke</b> are <b>to</b> enable <b>the work of the vineyard,</b> i.e., a small space next to the trees is necessary to enable animals to plow between them.
The Gemara analyzes this ruling: The <b>reason</b> this distance is required <b>is due to the work of the vineyard,</b> from which it may be inferred that if <b>not</b> for the problem <b>due to the work of the vineyard,</b> it would be permitted for one to plant his tree <b>close</b> to the boundary, <b>and</b> apparently, this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though there are roots</b> of the tree <b>that damage</b> his neighbor’s field. The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> a hard <b>rock [<i>tzunema</i>] interrupts</b> between the two fields, preventing the roots from passing through to the other field.
The Gemara continues: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> with regard to this point, <b>as it teaches</b> further on: If there <b>was a fence between them, this one places,</b> i.e., plants a tree, <b>close</b> to <b>the fence from here, and that one places,</b> i.e., plants a tree, <b>close</b> to <b>the fence from here.</b> If the <i>baraita</i> were referring to a case where the roots could travel across, how could it be permitted for both neighbors to plant their trees alongside each other? Consequently, it must be referring to a situation where a rock separates between the two fields below, and therefore the neighbors may plant their trees near the fence.
The Gemara responds: <b>If so, say the last clause</b> of that mishna: If <b>the roots</b> of the tree <b>extended into</b> the field <b>of another,</b> the neighbor <b>may cut them off to a depth of three handbreadths, so that they do not impede the plow.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But if a rock interrupts</b> between the two fields and forms a barrier, <b>what are</b> these roots <b>doing there,</b> i.e., how did they get there? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>is saying: And if</b> there is <b>no rock, and the roots</b> of the tree <b>extended into</b> the field <b>of another,</b> the neighbor <b>may cut them off to a depth of three handbreadths so that they do not impede the plow.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (25b): <b>One must distance a tree twenty-five cubits from a cistern.</b> The Gemara analyzes this <i>halakha</i>: The <b>reason</b> for this ruling <b>is that there is a cistern,</b> from which it may be inferred that <b>if there is no cistern, one may place,</b> i.e., plant, his tree <b>close</b> to the neighbor’s field. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> even <b>when there is no cistern one may also not place</b> it <b>close</b> to the neighbor’s field. <b>And</b> by mentioning a cistern, the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>teaches us this: That the roots</b> of a tree <b>extend and damage the cistern up to</b> a distance of <b>twenty-five cubits</b> away.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the last clause</b> of that mishna: <b>And if the tree preceded</b> the cistern, <b>one is not</b> required to <b>cut down</b> the tree. <b>But if</b> one <b>may not place</b> the tree <b>close</b> to the boundary even if there is no cistern, <b>how can you find</b> a case where the tree preceded the cistern? Why would its owner not be required to cut it down? The Gemara answers: This is <b>as Rav Pappa says</b> with regard to a similar matter, that it is referring <b>to a buyer</b> who purchases part of a field. <b>So too</b> here, it is referring <b>to a buyer.</b> In other words, a field contained a cistern and tree alongside each other, and the owner sold the part of the field containing the cistern.
The Gemara cites yet another source: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (25a): <b>One must distance the water in which flax is steeped from vegetables</b> growing in a neighbor’s field, <b>and</b> one must distance <b>leeks from onions</b> growing in a neighbor’s field, <b>and</b> one must likewise distance <b>mustard from bees</b> that are in a neighbor’s field. The Gemara analyzes this statement: The <b>reason is that there are vegetables</b> present, from which it may be inferred that <b>if there are no vegetables, one may place</b> the water <b>close</b> to the neighbor’s field. The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>No,</b> even <b>if there are no vegetables one may also not place</b> the water <b>close</b> to the neighbor’s field. <b>And</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us that these</b> items mentioned in that mishna <b>are harmful to each other.</b>
The Gemara responds: <b>If so, say the last clause</b> of that mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei renders it permitted</b> to plant near the neighbor’s bees <b>in the</b> case of <b>mustard.</b> As explained in a <i>baraita</i>, this is <b>because he can say to</b> the owner of the bees: <b>Just as you say to me: Keep your mustard away from my bees,</b> I can say to you: <b>Keep your bees away from my mustard, as they come and eat my mustard plants.</b> In other words, you are damaging my property as well.

Daf 18b

<b>And if</b> one <b>may not place</b> an item that might cause damage <b>close</b> to his neighbor’s boundary, <b>how can you find</b> a case where each neighbor is damaging the property of the other? <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> This is referring <b>to a buyer</b> who purchased part of his neighbor’s field, and it contains a substance or items that might cause damage, e.g., the water in which flax is steeped or mustard. In the other section of the field the neighbor retained an item or substance that could be damaged. In this manner, it is possible for the item that causes damage to be found near the boundary of the neighbor without one having violated the ruling of the mishna.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> this is referring <b>to a buyer, what is the reason of the Rabbis,</b> who say that the neighbor can demand that the buyer distance that which causes damage? After all, he has not acted improperly. <b>And furthermore, what is the reason of Rabbi Yosei</b> for disagreeing only in the case of the mustard and the bees? <b>Even</b> the case of <b>water in which flax is steeped and vegetables</b> is <b>also</b> subject to the same reasoning: Why should he have to distance his water, considering that he did not act improperly?
<b>Ravina said</b> that the explanation is as follows: <b>The Rabbis hold</b> that the responsibility falls <b>on the one who causes damage to distance himself.</b> The one who has the potential to cause damage must act to prevent the damage from occurring. This is the <i>halakha</i> even if his initial placement was done in accordance with <i>halakha</i>, as in the case where one bought part of a field.
The Gemara asks: Does this prove <b>by inference</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who disagrees with the ruling of the Rabbis, <b>holds that</b> that the responsibility falls <b>on the</b> one whose property <b>was damaged to distance himself;</b> i.e., to avoid being damaged? But <b>if</b> the responsibility to distance oneself falls <b>on the</b> one whose property <b>was damaged, even</b> in the case of <b>water in which flax is steeped and vegetables</b> the owner should <b>also</b> not have to distance himself. Why does Rabbi Yosei distinguish between that situation and the case of bees and mustard?
<b>Rather, actually Rabbi Yosei also holds</b> that the responsibility to distance oneself falls <b>on the one who causes damage,</b> even if he did not act improperly. <b>And this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yosei is saying to the Rabbis:</b> Your explanation <b>works out well</b> with regard to <b>water in which flax is steeped and vegetables,</b> where the one who causes damage must distance himself, as <b>these damage those, but those do not damage these,</b> i.e., the water in which flax is steeped damages the vegetables, but the vegetables do not damage the water. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>mustard and bees, they both damage one another.</b> In light of this factor, and since the initial planting of the mustard was permitted, the owner of the bees should distance them from the mustard.
<b>And</b> as for <b>the Rabbis,</b> how do they respond to this claim? They maintain that <b>bees do not damage mustard.</b> Their reasoning is that <b>if</b> it is referring <b>to a seed,</b> the bees will <b>not find it. If</b> it is referring <b>to a leaf, it will grow back,</b> and therefore no damage has been caused.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does Rabbi Yosei hold</b> that the responsibility falls <b>on the one who causes damage to distance himself? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (25b) that <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even though the cistern preceded the tree,</b> the owner need <b>not cut down</b> the tree, <b>as this one digs a cistern in his</b> property, <b>and that one plants</b> the tree <b>in his</b> property? <b>Rather, actually Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that the responsibility falls <b>on the</b> one whose property <b>was damaged to distance himself. And</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>spoke to the Rabbis in accordance with their statement.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: Rabbi Yosei was saying to the Rabbis: <b>In my</b> opinion, the responsibility falls <b>on the</b> one whose property <b>was damaged to distance himself, and</b> therefore <b>even</b> in the case of <b>water in which flax is steeped and vegetables,</b> the owner of the water <b>need not distance</b> himself. <b>But according to your</b> opinion, that the responsibility falls <b>on the one who causes damage</b> to distance himself, this <b>works out well</b> with regard to <b>water in which flax is steeped and vegetables, as these damage those and those do not damage these. But mustard and bees both damage one another,</b> and if the mustard owner acted properly, the owner of the bees should be required to move his bees.
The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> how do <b>the Rabbis</b> respond to this claim? They hold that <b>bees do not damage mustard: If</b> this is referring <b>to a seed,</b>

Daf 19a

the bees will <b>not find it; if</b> it is referring <b>to a leaf, it will grow back.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Nor</b> may one set up <b>a launderer’s pond</b> near his neighbor’s wall unless he distances it three handbreadths from the wall. <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: They taught this only with regard to a soaking pond,</b> in which soiled clothes are left to soak for several days. <b>But</b> in the case <b>of a washing pond [<i>hanadyan</i>],</b> where clothes are actively cleaned, <b>four cubits</b> are required. <b>That</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A launderer’s pond</b> must be kept <b>four cubits</b> from one’s neighbor’s wall. <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that one must keep a distance of only <b>three handbreadths? Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that the statement of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> is correct?
<b>And some raise</b> this <b>as a contradiction,</b> and present the mishna and <i>baraita</i> as apparently conflicting sources. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>a launderer’s pond</b> must be kept <b>three handbreadths</b> from his neighbor’s property. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>four cubits</b> are required? <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the mishna is referring to <b>a soaking pond,</b> which requires three handbreadths; <b>there,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>a washing pond,</b> in which case four cubits are necessary. <b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Avya, teaches</b> the mishna <b>explicitly</b> as reading: <b>Unless he distanced three handbreadths from the rim of the soaking pond and the wall.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that one who digs a pit must distance it three handbreadths from another’s property and <b>plaster</b> it <b>with lime. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: What is the precise wording of the mishna? <b>Did we learn: And plasters with lime,</b> meaning that the walls must be plastered with lime in addition to distancing the pit three handbreadths, <b>or perhaps we learned: Or plasters with lime,</b> i.e., one may plaster the walls with lime instead of digging the pit at a distance of three handbreadths.
The Gemara answers: It is <b>obvious that we learned: And plasters with lime, as, if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we learned: Or plasters with lime,</b> which is the same as what is stated in the clause of the mishna discussing olive refuse, <b>if so, let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>combine them and teach them</b> together. If the same <i>halakha</i> applied in all circumstances, all of the mishna’s cases could be taught together.
The Gemara answers: This is not proof, as <b>perhaps</b> these cases are taught separately <b>because this</b> type of <b>damage is not similar to that</b> type of <b>damage. The first clause</b> of the mishna addresses the issue of <b>damage</b> due <b>to moisture,</b> whereas <b>the last clause</b> addresses the issue of <b>damage</b> due <b>to heat.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>rock that</b> is so soft it <b>crumbles in</b> one’s <b>hands, this one digs his pit from here,</b> on his property, <b>and that one digs his pit from there. This one distances</b> his pit <b>three handbreadths and plasters with lime, and that one distances</b> his pit <b>three handbreadths and plasters with lime.</b> The Gemara analyzes this ruling: The specific <b>reason</b> one must also plaster with lime is that he is using rock that <b>crumbles in</b> one’s <b>hands,</b> from which it may be inferred that if it is rock that <b>does not crumble in</b> one’s <b>hands,</b> one would <b>not</b> be required to plaster with lime as well.
The Gemara answers: One could say that <b>the same is true,</b> i.e., <b>that even though</b> he is using rock <b>that does not crumble in</b> one’s <b>hands,</b> he must <b>also plaster with lime. And it was necessary for</b> the <i>tanna</i> to mention the case of rock that <b>crumbles in</b> one’s <b>hands,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since it crumbles in</b> one’s <b>hands, let us require a greater distance.</b> Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>one must distance the solid residue</b> of produce that has been pressed free of its oil, <b>and</b> animal <b>manure, and salt, and lime, and rocks</b> three handbreadths from the wall of another, or plaster its receptacle with lime. The Gemara comments: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Shabbat</i> 47b): <b>With what</b> substances <b>may one insulate</b> a pot of cooked food on Shabbat eve, <b>and with what</b> substances <b>may one not insulate</b> it?
<b>One may insulate</b> the pot <b>neither with the solid residue</b> of produce that has been pressed free of its oil, <b>nor with manure, nor with salt, nor with lime, nor with sand, whether</b> those materials are <b>moist</b> or <b>whether</b> they are <b>dry.</b> All of these materials spontaneously generate heat when piled up for an extended period of time. Therefore, they add heat to the pot they insulate. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different here that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>rocks and it does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>sand, and what is different there that it teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>sand and it does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>rocks?</b>
<b>Rav Yosef says:</b> There is a practical reason for this difference. Rocks are not mentioned there <b>because it is not customary for people to insulate</b> food <b>with rocks. Abaye said to him: And is it customary for people to insulate</b> food <b>with wool fleece and tabs of purple wool? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may insulate</b> food <b>with wool fleece; with combed wool clumps,</b> which are unwoven; <b>with tabs of purple wool; and with</b> swatches of <b>soft material; but</b> one <b>may not move them</b> on Shabbat because they are set-aside [<i>muktze</i>].
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the <i>tanna</i> follows the biblical aphorism in the verse that states: <b>“Its neighbor tells about him”</b> (Job 36:33), i.e., one example is mentioned and the same applies to the other case. <b>He taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>rocks here and the same is true of sand; he taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>sand there and the same is true of rocks. Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>If</b> this is correct, that <b>“its neighbor tells about him,” let him teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>all of</b> these examples <b>in one</b> case, <b>and let him teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> of just <b>one in the other</b> case, <b>and</b> it can be said that <b>the same is true</b> with regard <b>to the others.</b>
<b>Rather, Rava said: There, this is</b> the <b>reason that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>rocks: Because they break,</b> i.e., scratch, <b>the pot,</b> and consequently people do not use them for insulating food at all. <b>Here, this is</b> the <b>reason that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>does not teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of <b>sand: Because it heats hot</b> items <b>and cools cold</b> items, and therefore it does not cause any damage to the wall.
The Gemara asks: <b>But Rabbi Oshaya taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that one must distance <b>sand</b> from his neighbor’s wall. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it is referring <b>to damp</b> sand, which must be kept at a distance due to its moisture. The Gemara challenges: <b>Let the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>also teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of sand <b>and we will interpret it</b> as referring <b>to damp</b> sand. The Gemara answers: This <i>tanna</i> <b>already taught</b> the case of <b>a water channel,</b> which is a source of dampness, and therefore there was no need to mention damp sand as well.
The Gemara rejects this answer: That is incorrect, as <b>is that to say</b> that the mishna includes only one example of a source of dampness? <b>Doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the case of <b>a water channel? And</b> yet <b>it</b> also <b>teaches</b> the example of <b>a launderer’s pond.</b> This demonstrates that the mishna teaches many cases, despite the similarity between them, and therefore it should have mentioned the <i>halakha</i> in the case of sand as well.
The Gemara answers: Both of <b>those</b> particular examples <b>are necessary, as, had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> only the case of <b>a water channel,</b> one would have claimed that a distance must be kept <b>because it is fixed,</b> i.e., water constantly passes through it. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a launderer’s pond, which is not fixed,</b> as it sometimes holds water and sometimes does not, one might <b>say</b> that one need <b>not</b> distance it from his neighbor’s property. <b>And</b> conversely, <b>had</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> only the case of <b>a launderer’s pond,</b> one might have said that this must be distanced <b>because</b> its water <b>is fixed and standing</b> in one location and therefore leaks out. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>a water channel,</b> one might say distancing it is <b>not</b> required. Consequently, <b>it is necessary</b> to state both examples. By contrast, including the <i>halakha</i> in the case of sand would not add any novel understanding.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One must distance seeds,</b> i.e., one may not plant seeds, <b>and</b> one may not operate <b>the plow,</b> and one must eliminate urine, three handbreadths from the wall of another. The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary to mention <b>seeds?</b> Let him <b>derive this</b> requirement to distance the seeds <b>due to</b> the requirement to distance <b>a plow,</b> as in any event the ground must be plowed before it can be sown? The Gemara answers: This is referring to planting <b>with a single hand motion,</b> which is performed without plowing.
The Gemara further challenges: The mishna teaches that one must distance <b>a plow; but</b> let him <b>derive this</b> requirement to distance a plow <b>due to</b> the requirement to distance the <b>seeds,</b> as plowing is preparation for planting. The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to one who plows</b> to prepare the ground <b>for trees.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if so, let him <b>derive this</b> requirement to distance a plow due to the requirement to distance the <b>water.</b> If there are trees, there must be a water channel to irrigate them, and arranging one’s field in such a manner should be prohibited for that reason. The Gemara answers: <b>The <i>tanna</i> is referring to Eretz Yisrael,</b> concerning <b>which it is written: “And drinks water as the rain of heaven comes down”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:11). In Eretz Yisrael, water channels were not needed.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that seeds</b>

Daf 19b

<b>take root to the sides,</b> i.e., the growing roots spread sideways and cause damage to walls? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:1): With regard to <b>one who bends</b> a branch of <b>a grapevine into the ground</b> so that it strikes roots and produces a new vine, <b>if it does not have three handbreadths of earth over it he may not plant a seed above</b> it, as he would thereby transgress the prohibition of diverse kinds?
<b>And it is taught with regard to</b> this mishna: <b>But one may plant on either side</b> of that bent branch. This indicates that there is no concern that the roots of the seeds will spread out sideways. <b>Rabbi Ḥagga says in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> The issue here is not that the roots will spread out sideways and reach the wall. Rather, it is prohibited to plant seeds near one’s neighbor’s property <b>because they break up the ground and cause loose soil to rise up,</b> which damages the foundation of the wall.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And urine</b> must be kept at a distance of <b>three handbreadths from the wall</b> of one’s neighbor. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says:</b> It <b>is permitted</b> for <b>a person to urinate alongside the wall of another, as it is written: “And I will cut off from Ahab those who urinate against the wall, and him that is shut up and him that is left at large in Israel”</b> (I Kings 21:21). As the verse employs the term “those who urinate against the wall” to mean males, it seems that urinating against a wall was a common practice. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>urine</b> must be kept a distance of <b>three handbreadths from the wall?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the mishna is referring to urine <b>that is poured</b> from a chamber pot, as opposed to urine that is passed from the body.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not pour water at the side of the wall of another unless he distances</b> the water <b>three handbreadths from it.</b> If pouring water is prohibited, then all the more so should urination be prohibited. The Gemara explains: <b>There too,</b> it is referring to urine <b>that is poured</b> from a chamber pot.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not urinate alongside the wall of another unless he distances</b> himself <b>three handbreadths from it. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>in</b> the case of <b>a brick wall. But in</b> the case of <b>a stone wall,</b> one must distance himself <b>enough so that it does not cause damage. And how far</b> must he distance himself? One <b>handbreadth. And</b> if there is <b>hard rock</b> present, it is <b>permitted</b> to urinate there. The Gemara comments: <b>The refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana is a conclusive refutation,</b> and his ruling is rejected.
The Gemara asks: <b>But Rabba bar bar Ḥana stated a verse</b> in support of his opinion; how can the <i>baraita</i> rule counter to what is written in a verse? The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> is what it <b>is saying there,</b> i.e., this is the meaning of that verse: <b>I will not even leave</b> Ahab <b>something whose manner is to urinate against a wall. And what is that? A dog.</b> According to this interpretation, the verse is not referring to people at all.
§ <b>Rabbi Tovi bar Kisna says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: A wafer does not reduce</b> the dimensions <b>of a window.</b> When a corpse, or a significant part thereof, is in one room, its impurity can spread to a room adjacent to it if there is a window of a certain size between the rooms. Shmuel states that when one puts a wafer in a window, the wafer is not considered an obstruction, so the size of the opening as relevant to this <i>halakha</i> remains the same. The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> discuss <b>specifically</b> this case? Why does Shmuel teach this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a wafer? Even a thick</b> chunk of bread <b>also</b> does not reduce the dimensions of a window.
The Gemara answers: Shmuel <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>thick</b> bread. <b>Since it is fit for him</b> to consume, <b>he does not nullify it,</b> i.e., he does not plan to leave it in the window for an extended amount of time. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a wafer, which</b> becomes <b>disgusting</b> when placed in a window, <b>I might say</b> that <b>he does nullify it</b> and it becomes part of the house, thereby reducing the size of the window. To counter this, Shmuel <b>teaches us</b> that even a wafer is not nullified, as it can be used to feed animals, as one is not particular about their food. Therefore, the wafer does not become part of the window in which it is placed.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And</b> let him <b>derive this</b> <i>halakha</i> from the fact that a wafer is <b>an item that is susceptible to ritual impurity, and any item that is susceptible to impurity does not serve as a barrier against</b> the spread of <b>impurity.</b> The Gemara explains: This is referring to a wafer <b>that was kneaded in fruit juice,</b> which is not one of the liquids that renders food susceptible to ritual impurity, and therefore the wafer is not susceptible to ritual impurity. Consequently, one might have thought that it serves as a barrier before ritual impurity and reduces the dimensions of the window.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Shmuel’s opinion from a mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 6:2): With regard to <b>a basket</b> that is <b>full of straw, or</b> an earthenware <b>barrel full of dried figs, which are placed in a window,</b> one <b>considers: If the straw or dried figs would stand on their own were</b> the basket or barrel <b>removed,</b> then <b>they would serve as a barrier against</b> the spread of impurity. <b>But if</b> they would <b>not</b> stand on their own <b>they would not serve as a barrier.</b> The Gemara explains the objection: <b>But</b> why should the straw or dried figs serve as a barrier? Even <b>straw</b> that can stand on its own <b>is fit for</b> feeding to <b>one’s animal</b> and will likely be removed from the opening, which means it should not be considered part of the window.
The Gemara answers: The ruling of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to rotted</b> straw, which is unfit for animal consumption. The Gemara asks: But <b>it is fit for</b> use in the making of <b>clay</b> for bricks. The Gemara answers: This is referring to straw <b>that has thorns in it</b> and therefore is not fit for making bricks. The Gemara challenges: Even so, it is <b>fit for kindling</b> a fire. The Gemara answers that this is referring <b>to wet</b> straw. The Gemara responds: Nevertheless, it is <b>fit for kindling a large</b> fire. If one builds a large fire, wet straw will dry and become ignitable. The Gemara answers: <b>A large fire is not common,</b> and therefore, in all likelihood, the straw will remain in the window.
The Gemara further asks: But <b>dried figs are fit for him</b> to consume, and he will certainly remove them. Consequently, they should not be considered fixed in their place. <b>Shmuel says:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the figs <b>became worm infested [<i>beshehitrifu</i>]. And so Rabba bar Avuh teaches:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the figs <b>became worm infested.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the</b> exact <b>circumstances of this barrel</b> that held the dried figs? <b>If</b> this is referring to a case <b>where</b> its <b>opening faced outward,</b> i.e., not toward the source of the ritual impurity,

Daf 20a

<b>let</b> the barrel <b>itself serve as a barrier.</b> It should not be susceptible to impurity in this case, <b>as an earthenware vessel does not contract impurity if its exterior</b> is exposed to impurity. <b>Rather,</b> one must say <b>that its opening faces inward,</b> and it is rendered impure because the impurity enters through its opening. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>actually its opening faces outward, and with what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with a metal barrel,</b> which does contract impurity through its exterior.
The Gemara <b>raises</b> another <b>objection</b> to the assumption that an item for which there is a use does not reduce the dimensions of a window, even if is not susceptible to impurity, from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Oholot</i> 14:6): With regard to <b>grass that one plucked and placed in a window or that grew on its own in windows; and scraps of fabric that do not measure three by three</b> fingerbreadths; <b>and a limb or flesh dangling from an animal or a beast; and a bird resting in the window; and a gentile sitting in the window; and</b> a child <b>born</b> after <b>eight</b> months of pregnancy, who is not expected to survive, <b>that is placed in the window; and salt; and an earthenware vessel; and a Torah scroll, all these reduce the dimensions of the window.</b> Consequently, impurity passes through only if there remains an open space of a square handbreadth. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>snow, hail, frost, ice, and water, all these do not reduce the dimensions of a window.</b>
The Gemara proceeds to challenge Shmuel’s ruling from each of the cases of the <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> according to Shmuel, who says that an item that has a use is not considered part of the window and does not reduce the dimensions of the space, <b>grass is fit</b> for consumption by <b>one’s animal,</b> so it will not remain in the window. Yet the <i>baraita</i> states that grass reduces the dimensions of the window. The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to <i>afrazta</i>,</b> which is poisonous grass that is unfit for an animal to consume.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>Or</b> grass <b>that grew on its own</b> also reduces the dimensions of the window. The Gemara asks: But <b>since</b> the grass <b>damages the wall,</b> the owner <b>will remove it.</b> Therefore, it should not serve as a barrier to impurity. <b>Rabba says:</b> This is referring <b>to a wall of a ruin,</b> whose structural integrity is insignificant, and therefore the owner will not trouble himself to remove the grass. <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> The <i>baraita</i> may even be referring <b>to a wall</b> in <b>a settled</b> house, and it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the grass <b>comes from three</b> handbreadths <b>beyond</b> the <b>window.</b> In other words, the grass does not grow on the window but takes root some distance away, and from there it reaches the window. The homeowner is not particular about this grass and will not uproot it.
The Gemara further asks: Why do <b>scraps of fabric</b> reduce the dimensions of the window? After all, <b>they are fit for</b> patching <b>a tear in a garment.</b> The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to thick</b> scraps, which are unsuitable for patching. The Gemara challenges: Nevertheless, they are <b>fit for a bloodletter</b> to wipe up the blood at the point of incision. The Gemara answers: It is referring <b>to sackcloth,</b> which scratches the skin, and would not be used for that purpose.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is referring <b>to sackcloth,</b> why does the <i>baraita</i> state <b>that it is not three by three</b> fingerbreadths? It <b>should have</b> said that <b>it is not four by four</b> handbreadths. Rough woven material of the kind used for sacks rather than clothes is susceptible to impurity only if its area measures at least four by four handbreadths. The Gemara answers: It is not actual sackcloth; rather, it is <b>like sackcloth,</b> i.e., it is stiff, and will therefore not be used by a bloodletter, but is woven like regular clothing.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And a limb or flesh dangling from an animal or a beast</b> reduces the dimensions of a window. The Gemara asks: According to the opinion of Shmuel, why should this be so? After all, the animal can <b>arise and escape,</b> and therefore it should not be considered as part of the window. The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to</b> an animal that is <b>tied</b> in place.
The Gemara challenges: But the owner of the animal will take it and <b>slaughter it.</b> The Gemara answers: It is referring <b>to</b> an animal that is <b>non-kosher</b> and will not be slaughtered. The Gemara challenges: Even so, <b>he</b> will take it and <b>sell it to a gentile.</b> The Gemara responds: It is referring <b>to a lean</b> animal, which no one will buy. The Gemara continues: Even if the animal does not move, there is a use for the part that is dangling, <b>since he</b> can <b>cut it off</b> and <b>throw it to the dogs.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since there is suffering to an animal</b> if he cuts it off, <b>he will not do</b> that.
The <i>baraita</i> further teaches: <b>And a bird resting in the window</b> reduces its dimensions. The Gemara challenges: But it will <b>fly away,</b> and therefore it should not be considered as part of the window. The Gemara answers: This is referring to a bird <b>that is tied</b> in place. The Gemara further challenges: But the owner will take it and <b>slaughter it.</b> The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to a non-kosher bird,</b> which he will not slaughter. The Gemara continues: Even if it is non-kosher <b>he</b> will take it and <b>sell it to a gentile.</b> The Gemara responds: It is referring <b>to a <i>kelanita</i>,</b> a type of bird that is so bony that no one would purchase it to consume it.
The Gemara asks: But even so, <b>he</b> can <b>give it to a child</b> to play with, so why does it reduce the dimensions of the window? The Gemara answers: It is referring to a bird <b>that scratches.</b> The Gemara challenges: But <b>a <i>kelanita</i> does not scratch.</b> The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a type of bird that is <b>like a <i>kelanita</i></b> in that it is bony, but is inclined to scratch people.
The <i>baraita</i> further states: <b>And a gentile sitting in the window</b> reduces its dimensions. The Gemara asks: But the gentile will <b>arise and leave,</b> so why does he reduce the dimensions of the window? The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to</b> someone <b>who is tied</b> in place. The Gemara continues: <b>Another</b> person <b>will come</b> and <b>release him.</b> The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to a leper,</b> whom people are afraid to touch. The Gemara challenges: <b>Another leper will come</b> and <b>release him. Rather,</b> this is referring <b>to a prisoner of the monarchy.</b> Since he is confined as a punishment, others are afraid to release him.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>And</b> a child <b>born</b> after <b>eight</b> months of pregnancy <b>who is placed in the window</b> reduces its dimensions. The Gemara challenges: Perhaps <b>his mother will come and remove him</b> from there. The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to Shabbat,</b> when it is prohibited to move this child, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A child <b>born</b> after <b>eight</b> months <b>is like a stone</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of set-aside [<i>muktze</i>], <b>and</b> therefore <b>it is prohibited to move him; but his mother may bend over</b> the child <b>and nurse him, due to the danger</b> that failure to nurse will cause her to fall ill.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>Salt</b> reduces the dimensions of a window. The Gemara challenges: <b>It is fit</b> for use and people will remove it from there. The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to bitter</b> salt, which is not used as a seasoning. The Gemara challenges: Nevertheless, <b>it is fit for</b> tanning <b>hides.</b> The Gemara responds: It is referring to salt <b>that has thorns</b> mixed with it, and therefore it will not be used for tanning.
The Gemara challenges: Even so, <b>since</b> this salt <b>is damaging to the wall, he will remove it</b> from there. The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where it sits on a shard</b> of earthenware, and consequently it does not damage the wall. The Gemara states: If it is resting on earthenware, <b>let</b> the <b>shard itself serve as a barrier</b> against the spreading of the impurity. Why, then, is the salt mentioned?

Daf 20b

The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the shard <b>does not have</b> the sufficient <b>measure</b> for ritual impurity, and is therefore considered insignificant. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shabbat</i> 82a): One who carries a shard of <b>earthenware</b> on Shabbat is liable only if it is <b>equivalent</b> in size to that which is used <b>to place between one pillar and another</b> when they are piled on the ground, to strengthen the pillars.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>An earthenware vessel</b> reduces the dimensions of a window. The Gemara challenges: But it is <b>fit for one</b> to use; therefore, it is likely to be removed from the window. The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the earthenware <b>is dirty.</b> The Gemara challenges: Even so, <b>it is fit for a bloodletter</b> to collect the blood. It would not matter to him if the earthenware were dirty. The Gemara answers: It is referring to a case <b>where it is perforated</b> and therefore unfit for that use.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: <b>A Torah scroll</b> reduces the dimensions of a window. The Gemara challenges: But it <b>is fit for reading;</b> therefore, it might be removed. The Gemara answers: This is referring to a Torah scroll <b>that is worn out</b> and unfit for reading. The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> one is <b>required</b> to place the Torah scroll in <b>a repository</b> for unusable sacred books; therefore, he will certainly remove it to be stored away. The Gemara answers: This is referring to one who determines that <b>its repository will be there.</b> In other words, it was placed in the window with the intent of storing it there in its worn-out state.
§ With regard to the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> referring to salt, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rav says: One can construct a barrier</b> to delineate a private domain on Shabbat or to block the spreading of ritual impurity <b>with anything except for salt and fat,</b> as salt crumbles and fat melts in the heat. <b>And Shmuel says: Even salt</b> can be used as a barrier. <b>Rav Pappa said: And they do not disagree,</b> as <b>this</b> ruling of Shmuel is referring to <b>Sodomite salt,</b> which is like stone and can be used as a barrier, and <b>that</b> ruling of Rav is referring <b>to <i>isterokanit</i> salt,</b> which is taken from the sea and is composed of grains.
The Gemara adds: <b>And now that Rabba said:</b> If <b>a person makes two piles of salt</b> at the opening to an alleyway <b>and places</b> a cross <b>beam on top of them,</b> so <b>that the salt supports the</b> cross <b>beam and the</b> cross <b>beam supports the salt</b> by weighing it down and compressing it, he can use this beam to render it permitted to carry in the alleyway on Shabbat, one can say that <b>even <i>isterokanit</i> salt</b> can be used as a barrier. <b>And</b> even so, Rav and Shmuel <b>do not disagree: This</b> ruling of Shmuel is referring to a case <b>where there is</b> a cross <b>beam</b> to weigh the salt down, and <b>that</b> ruling of Rava is referring to a case where <b>there is no</b> cross <b>beam.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that <b>one must distance a mill</b> from a neighbor’s wall by a distance of <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>from the lower stone</b> of the mill, <b>which is four</b> handbreadths <b>from the upper stone</b> of the mill. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that one must distance a mill from the property of his neighbor? It is <b>due to the vibrations</b> it causes. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> the measure for distancing a mill <b>on a base</b> is <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>from the lower millstone [<i>ha’isterobil</i>], which is four</b> handbreadths <b>from the mouth [<i>hakelet</i>],</b> where the wheat is fed in? But <b>there, what vibrations are there? Rather,</b> the reason for the distancing is <b>due to the noise</b> generated by the mill.
The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> there must be a distance of <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>from the</b> protruding <b>base</b> of <b>an oven</b> until the wall, <b>which is four</b> handbreadths <b>from the</b> narrow <b>upper rim</b> of the oven. <b>Abaye said: Learn from</b> the mishna that <b>the base of an oven</b> is <b>a handbreadth</b> wider than its rim. The practical <b>difference</b> of this observation is with respect <b>to buying and selling,</b> i.e., a buyer should know that this is the proper ratio for the dimensions of an oven.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person may not set up an oven inside a house unless there is a space four cubits high above it,</b> i.e., between the top of the oven and the ceiling, to avoid burning the ceiling, which serves as the floor of the residence above. If <b>one was setting up</b> an oven <b>in the upper story, there must be a plaster floor beneath it,</b> which serves as the ceiling of the lower story, at least <b>three handbreadths</b> thick, so that the ceiling below does not burn. <b>And</b> in the case <b>of a stove</b> the plaster floor must be at least one <b>handbreadth</b> thick.
<b>And if</b> he <b>causes damage</b> in any case, <b>he pays</b> compensation for that <b>which he damaged. Rabbi Shimon says: They said all of these measurements</b> to teach <b>only that if he causes damage he is exempt from paying,</b> as he took all reasonable precautions.
The mishna continues: <b>A person may not open a bakery or a dye shop beneath the storeroom of another, and</b> he <b>may not</b> establish <b>a cattle barn</b> there, as these produce heat, smoke, and odors, which rise and damage the items in the storeroom. The mishna comments: <b>In truth,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that in the case <b>of</b> a storeroom of <b>wine</b> the Sages rendered it <b>permitted</b> to set up a bakery and a dye shop beneath, as the heat that rises does not damage the wine. <b>But</b> they did <b>not</b> render it permitted to establish <b>a cattle barn,</b> because its odor damages the wine.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that in the case of <b>an oven</b> the plaster floor must be <b>four</b> handbreadths thick, <b>and with regard to a stove</b> it must be <b>three?</b> By contrast, the mishna says that the plaster floor beneath and oven and a stove must be three handbreadths and one handbreadth thick, respectively. <b>Abaye said: When that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> ovens and stoves <b>of bakers.</b> Since they bake all day long, their implements get very hot. The <b>oven</b> discussed <b>in our</b> mishna is similar to <b>a baker’s stove,</b> which is why in both cases a distance of three handbreadths is required.
The mishna teaches that one <b>may not open a bakery</b> or a dye shop beneath the storeroom of another, and he may not establish a cattle barn there. A Sage <b>taught: If the cattle barn preceded the storeroom it is permitted,</b> i.e., the barn owner is not required to move it. With regard to this point, <b>Abaye raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>he cleaned and sprinkled</b> the area, i.e., he prepared it for use <b>as a storeroom</b> but he has not yet filled it, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered a storeroom already, and therefore others may no longer put a cattle barn beneath it, or perhaps the <i>halakha</i> is that as long as it is empty he cannot prevent others from establishing a cattle barn?
Similarly, if he <b>added windows</b> for ventilation, which demonstrates his intention to use it as a storeroom, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Likewise, if he establishes <b>an enclosed veranda beneath the storeroom, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? If he <b>built an upper room on top of his house</b> for storage, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? None of these questions are answered, and the Gemara declares that they <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. The Gemara cites a similar question: <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, raises a dilemma:</b> If he placed <b>dates and pomegranates</b> there, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is this considered the start of its use as a storeroom or not? No answer was found to this question either, and the Gemara declares: The dilemma <b>shall stand [<i>teiku</i>]</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>in truth, it is permitted</b> in the case <b>of wine</b> but not in the case of a cattle barn. The Gemara states that a Sage <b>taught: They permitted</b> it in the case <b>of wine because</b> the heat and the smoke <b>improve</b> the wine. <b>But</b> they did <b>not</b> permit one to establish <b>a cattle barn, because</b> a barn <b>creates a bad odor. Rav Yosef said: This</b> wine <b>of ours</b> spoils quickly, and therefore <b>even the smoke of a candle also damages it. Rav Sheshet said: And alfalfa [<i>ve’aspasta</i>] is considered like a cattle barn</b> in this regard, because it rots over time and creates a foul odor.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a resident wants to open <b>a store in</b> his <b>courtyard,</b> his neighbor <b>can protest</b> to prevent <b>him</b> from doing so <b>and say to him: I am unable to sleep due to the sound of people entering</b> the store <b>and the sound of people exiting. But</b> one <b>may fashion utensils</b> in his house and <b>go out and sell</b> them <b>in the market,</b> despite the fact that he is not allowed to set up a store in the courtyard, <b>and</b> the neighbor <b>cannot protest</b> against <b>him</b> doing so <b>and say to him: I am unable to sleep due to the sound of the hammer</b> you use to fashion utensils, <b>nor</b> can he say: I cannot sleep <b>due to the sound of the mill</b> that you use to grind, <b>nor</b> can he say: I cannot sleep <b>due to the sound of the children.</b> It is permitted for one to make reasonable use of his own home.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, which states that one can prevent his neighbor from opening a store in the courtyard because the noise keeps him awake, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> which states that one cannot protest when his neighbor performs labor that is noisy? <b>Abaye said:</b> In <b>the latter clause we arrive at</b> the case of one who operates in <b>another courtyard,</b> i.e., one cannot prevent activity in a separate courtyard that is connected to the alleyway in which he lives. <b>Rava said to him: If so, let it teach</b> that <b>in a different courtyard it is permitted.</b> Why does the mishna not specify that it is referring to a different courtyard? <b>Rather, Rava said:</b>

Daf 21a

In <b>the latter clause we arrive at</b> the case of <b>schoolchildren</b> who come to learn Torah in his house, <b>and</b> this ruling applies <b>from</b> the time of <b>the ordinance of Yehoshua ben Gamla and onward.</b>
What was this ordinance? <b>As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Truly, that man is remembered for the good, and his name is Yehoshua ben Gamla. If not for him</b> the <b>Torah would have been forgotten from the Jewish people. Initially, whoever had a father</b> would have his father <b>teach him Torah,</b> and <b>whoever did not have a father would not learn Torah</b> at all. The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> verse <b>did they interpret homiletically</b> that allowed them to conduct themselves in this manner? They interpreted the verse that states: <b>“And you shall teach them [<i>otam</i>]</b> to your sons” (Deuteronomy 11:19), to mean: <b>And you yourselves [<i>atem</i>] shall teach,</b> i.e., you fathers shall teach your sons.
When the Sages saw that not everyone was capable of teaching their children and Torah study was declining, <b>they instituted</b> an ordinance <b>that teachers of children should be established in Jerusalem.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> verse <b>did they interpret homiletically</b> that enabled them to do this? They interpreted the verse: <b>“For Torah emerges from Zion”</b> (Isaiah 2:3). <b>But still, whoever had a father,</b> his father <b>ascended with him</b> to Jerusalem <b>and had him taught, but whoever did not have a father, he did not ascend and learn.</b> Therefore, the Sages <b>instituted</b> an ordinance <b>that</b> teachers of children <b>should be established</b> in one city <b>in each and every region [<i>pelekh</i>]. And they brought</b> the students <b>in at</b> the <b>age</b> of <b>sixteen</b> and <b>at</b> the <b>age</b> of <b>seventeen.</b>
<b>But</b> as the students were old and had not yet had any formal education, a student <b>whose teacher grew angry at him</b> would <b>rebel against him and leave.</b> It was impossible to hold the youths there against their will. This state of affairs continued <b>until Yehoshua ben Gamla came and instituted</b> an ordinance <b>that teachers of children should be established in each and every province and in each and every town, and they</b> would <b>bring</b> the children <b>in</b> to learn <b>at</b> the <b>age</b> of <b>six</b> and <b>at</b> the <b>age</b> of <b>seven.</b> With regard to the matter at hand, since this system was established for the masses, the neighbors cannot prevent a scholar from teaching Torah in the courtyard.
Concerning that same issue, <b>Rav said to Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat,</b> a teacher of children: <b>Do not accept</b> a student <b>before</b> the age of <b>six,</b> as he is too young, and it is difficult for him to learn in a steady manner. <b>From this</b> point <b>forward, accept him and stuff him</b> with Torah <b>like an ox. And Rav</b> further <b>said to Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat: When you strike a child</b> for educational purposes, <b>hit him only with the strap of a sandal,</b> which is small and does not cause pain. Rav further advised him: <b>He who reads,</b> let him <b>read</b> on his own; <b>whoever does not read, let him be a companion to his friends,</b> which will encourage him to learn to read.
With regard to a courtyard, the Gemara concluded that it is permitted for one to establish an elementary school to teach Torah and the neighbors cannot protest. The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this ruling from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one member of a courtyard who wishes to become a doctor, a bloodletter, a weaver [<i>vegardi</i>], or a teacher of children, the</b> other <b>members of the courtyard can prevent him</b> from doing so. This indicates that neighbors can protest the teaching of children in their shared courtyard. The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here,</b> i.e., when can they protest his teaching children? We are dealing <b>with</b> a case of <b>gentile children,</b> as there is no mitzva to educate them. In this situation, the neighbors can protest about the noise.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>two people who are residing in</b> one <b>courtyard, and one of them sought to become a doctor, a bloodletter, a weaver, or a teacher of children, the other can prevent him</b> from doing so. The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> we are dealing <b>with</b> a case of <b>gentile children.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who has a house in a jointly owned courtyard may not rent it to a doctor, nor to a bloodletter, nor to a weaver, nor to a Jewish teacher [<i>sofer</i>], nor to a gentile teacher.</b> This indicates that one’s neighbors can prevent him from teaching Jewish children. The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with the scribe [<i>sofer</i>] of the town,</b> who does not teach children but writes documents and letters for residents of the town. This type of work is not a mitzva, and since many people seek his services, the residents of the courtyard can prevent him from performing this job near their houses.
§ With regard to the ordinance of Yehoshua ben Gamla, and concerning teaching children in general, <b>Rava says: From</b> the time of <b>the ordinance of Yehoshua ben Gamla,</b> that schoolteachers must be established in each town, <b>and onward, one does not bring a child from one town to another.</b> Rather, each child is educated where he resides. <b>But one does bring them from one synagogue</b> where they learn <b>to another synagogue. And if a river separates</b> the areas <b>one does not bring</b> the children across, lest they fall into the river. <b>And if there is a bridge</b> spanning the river <b>one may bring</b> them across the river. <b>But if there is</b> only <b>a narrow bridge [<i>gamla</i>] one does not bring</b> them.
<b>And Rava said:</b> The maximum <b>number</b> of students for one <b>teacher of children</b> is <b>twenty-five children. And if there are fifty</b> children in a single place, <b>one establishes two</b> teachers, so that each one teaches twenty-five students. <b>And if there are forty</b> children, <b>one establishes an assistant, and</b> the teacher <b>receives help from</b> the residents of <b>the town</b> to pay the salary of the assistant.
<b>And Rava said:</b> If there is <b>a teacher of children who teaches</b> a few subjects, <b>and there is another who teaches more</b> subjects <b>than him, one does not remove</b> the first teacher from his position to hire the second, as <b>perhaps</b> the other teacher <b>will come to be negligent</b> due to the lack of competition. <b>Rav Dimi from Neharde’a said:</b> On the contrary, <b>all the more so</b> is it the case that he will <b>teach</b> in <b>a better</b> manner if he knows that he is the sole instructor in the place, as <b>jealousy among teachers increases wisdom.</b> The one who was dismissed will try to refine his skills so that he will be rehired, and this will prevent negligence on the part of the other teacher.
<b>And Rava said:</b> If there are <b>two teachers of children, one</b> who <b>teaches</b> a lot of material <b>but is not precise</b> in his statements, <b>and one</b> who <b>is precise but does not teach</b> a lot of material, <b>one hires the one who teaches</b> a lot of material <b>but is not precise.</b> Why is this? <b>Errors will be corrected by themselves,</b> and no lasting harm will be caused. By contrast, <b>Rav Dimi of Neharde’a said: One hires</b> the instructor <b>who is precise and does not teach</b> a lot of material, <b>as once an error is taught, it is taught,</b> and cannot be easily corrected.
The Gemara cites a proof for the opinion of Rav Dimi of Neharde’a: This is <b>as it is written: “For Joab and all Israel remained there six months until he had cut off every male in Edom”</b> (I Kings 11:16). <b>When</b> Joab <b>came before</b> King <b>David</b> after this episode, David <b>said to him:</b>

Daf 21b

<b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you did that?</b> Why did you kill only the males? Joab <b>said to him: As it is written: You shall blot out the males [<i>zakhar</i>] of Amalek,</b> i.e., the male descendants of Amalek, who descend from Edom. David <b>said to him: But we read</b> the verse as stating: <b>“You shall blot out the remembrance [<i>zekher</i>] of Amalek”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:19). Joab <b>said to him: I was taught to read it as <i>zakhar</i>.</b> Joab <b>went and asked his</b> childhood Bible <b>teacher.</b> Joab <b>said to him: How did you read</b> this word <b>to us?</b> The teacher <b>said to him:</b> I read it as <b><i>zekher</i>.</b> The teacher had read it the proper way, but he failed to notice that his student had learned it incorrectly.
Joab <b>took a sword to kill him.</b> The teacher <b>said to him: Why</b> do you want to kill me? Joab <b>said to him: As it is written: “Cursed is he who does the work of the Lord with a slack hand”</b> (Jeremiah 48:10), and you taught me incorrectly. The teacher <b>said to him: Leave that man to remain as cursed.</b> This is a sufficient punishment; there is no need to kill me. Joab <b>said to him: It is</b> also <b>written: “And cursed is he who keeps back his sword from blood”</b> (Jeremiah 48:10). <b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Joab <b>killed him, and there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>he did not kill him.</b> In any event, this episode demonstrates that an error learned in one’s childhood stays with him his whole life.
<b>And Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>a teacher of children,</b> a professional <b>tree planter, a butcher, a bloodletter, and a town scribe, all</b> these <b>are considered forewarned.</b> In other words, they need not be exhorted to perform their jobs correctly, as if they err in the performance of their duties they can be dismissed immediately. The <b>principle of the matter</b> is: With regard to <b>any</b> case <b>where loss is irreversible,</b> the individual <b>is</b> considered <b>forewarned.</b>
§ <b>Rav Huna said:</b> There was <b>a certain resident of an alleyway who set up a mill</b> in the alleyway and earned his living grinding grain for people. <b>And</b> subsequently <b>another resident of the alleyway came and set up</b> a mill <b>next to his. The <i>halakha</i> is that</b> the first one <b>may prevent him</b> from doing so if he wishes, <b>as he</b> can <b>say to him: You are disrupting my livelihood</b> by taking my customers.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that a <i>baraita</i> <b>supports his</b> opinion: <b>One must distance fish traps from fish,</b> i.e., from other fish traps, <b>as far as the fish travels,</b> i.e., the distance from which the fish will travel. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is this distance? <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says: Up to a parasang [<i>parsa</i>].</b> This indicates that one must distance himself from the place where another has established his business. The Gemara responds that this is no proof: Perhaps <b>fish are different, as they look around.</b> One fish explores the area ahead of the others, indicating to them where to go. Once they encounter the first trap they will not approach the second.
<b>Ravina said to Rava: Shall we say</b> that <b>Rav Huna spoke in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 60a): <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: A storekeeper may not hand out toasted grain and nuts to children</b> who patronize his store, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he</b> thereby <b>accustoms them to come to him</b> at the expense of competing storekeepers. <b>And the Rabbis permit</b> doing so. This indicates that according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, all forms of competition are prohibited, which would include the scenario concerning the mill.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that Rav Huna holds in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. The Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Yehuda only there, as</b> the storekeeper <b>can say to</b> his competitor: If <b>I distribute walnuts, you</b> can <b>distribute almonds [<i>shiyuskei</i>]. But here,</b> with regard to a resident of an alleyway who sets up a mill in that alleyway where another mill already exists, <b>even the Rabbis concede that</b> the owner of the first mill can <b>say to him: You are disrupting my livelihood,</b> as beforehand whoever required grinding came to me, and you have provided them with another option.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A man may establish a shop alongside the shop of another, and a bathhouse alongside the bathhouse of another, and</b> the other <b>cannot protest, because</b> the newcomer <b>can say to him: You operate in your</b> space, <b>and I operate in my</b> space.
The Gemara answers: This entire matter <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The residents of an alleyway can compel one another</b> to agree <b>not to allow among them</b> in that alleyway <b>a tailor, a tanner, a teacher of children, nor any type of craftsman.</b> They can bar outside craftsmen from plying their trade in that alleyway. <b>But one cannot compel his neighbor,</b> i.e., one who already lives in the alleyway, to refrain from practicing a particular occupation there. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> One can <b>even compel his neighbor</b> not to conduct such work in the alleyway. Rav Huna holds in accordance with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says:</b> It is <b>obvious to me</b> that <b>a resident of</b> one <b>town can prevent a resident of another town</b> from establishing a similar business in the locale of the first individual. <b>But if he pays the tax of that</b> first town, <b>he cannot prevent him</b> from doing business there, as he too is considered a resident of the town. <b>The resident of an alleyway cannot prevent a resident of his alleyway</b> from practicing a particular trade there, in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis in the <i>baraita</i>, and contrary to the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.
With these conclusions in mind, <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a resident of</b> one <b>alleyway</b> protesting about <b>a resident of another alleyway</b> conducting business there, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? No answer was found, and the Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. <b>Rav Yosef said: And Rav Huna,</b> who said that a resident of an alleyway can prevent another from setting up an additional mill, <b>concedes with regard to those who teach children that one cannot prevent</b> him from working, <b>as the Master said: Ezra instituted</b> an ordinance <b>for the Jewish people</b> requiring <b>that they establish</b> one <b>teacher alongside</b> another <b>teacher,</b> to raise the standard of teaching.
The Gemara challenges: <b>And let us be concerned lest</b> the teachers <b>will</b> thereby <b>come to be negligent.</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> the Sage who raised this objection:

Daf 22a

<b>Jealousy among teachers increases wisdom.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: And Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> who said that townspeople can bar craftsmen who come from other cities, <b>concedes with regard to</b> perfume <b>salesmen who travel from</b> one <b>town</b> to another <b>that</b> the townspeople <b>cannot prevent</b> them from entering their town. <b>As the Master said: Ezra instituted</b> an ordinance <b>for the Jewish people that</b> perfume <b>salesmen shall travel from town to town so that cosmetics will be available to Jewish women.</b> Since this ordinance was instituted on behalf of Jewish women, the Sages ruled that these peddlers could not be barred from entering a town.
The Gemara continues: <b>And this matter</b> applies only to one who seeks <b>to travel</b> from town to town as a salesman. <b>But</b> if he wants <b>to establish</b> a shop, this ruling was <b>not</b> stated, and the townspeople can prevent him from doing so. <b>And if he is a Torah scholar he may even establish</b> a shop as a perfume salesman. This is <b>like that</b> incident in <b>which Rava permitted Rabbi Yoshiya and Rav Ovadya to establish</b> a shop <b>not</b> in accordance <b>with the <i>halakha</i>. What is the reason</b> for this ruling? The reason is that <b>since they are rabbis, they are likely to be distracted from their studies</b> should they be required to travel from place to place.
§ The Gemara relates: There were <b>these basket sellers who brought baskets to Babylonia. The townspeople came</b> and <b>prevented them</b> from selling there. The two parties <b>came before Ravina</b> for a ruling. Ravina <b>said to them:</b> The basket sellers <b>came from outside</b> the town, <b>and they sell to</b> those from <b>outside</b> the town, i.e., to guests who are not residents of the town. The Gemara comments: <b>And this statement</b> applies only <b>on a market day,</b> when people from other towns come to shop, <b>but</b> they may <b>not</b> sell their wares <b>on non-market days. And even with regard to market days, we say</b> so <b>only</b> with regard <b>to selling in the market, but</b> this <i>halakha</i> does <b>not</b> apply <b>to circulating</b> around the town.
The Gemara further relates: There were <b>these wool sellers who brought wool to</b> the city of <b>Pum Nahara. The townsfolk came</b> and <b>prevented them</b> from selling it. The two parties <b>came before Rav Kahana</b> for a ruling. Rav Kahana <b>said to them: The <i>halakha</i> is that they may prevent you</b> from selling your wares. The wool sellers <b>said to him: We have debts</b> to collect in the city, and we must sell our wares in the meantime to sustain ourselves until we are paid. Rav Kahana <b>said to them: Go</b> and <b>sell the amount</b> needed <b>to sustain yourselves until you have collected your debts, and</b> then <b>leave.</b>
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Dimi of Neharde’a brought dried figs on a ship</b> to sell them. <b>The Exilarch said to Rava: Go</b> and <b>see; if he is a Torah scholar, reserve the market for him,</b> i.e., declare that he has the exclusive right to sell dried figs. <b>Rava said to</b> his student <b>Rav Adda bar Abba: Go</b> and <b>smell his jar,</b> i.e., determine whether or not Rav Dimi is a Torah scholar.
Rav Adda bar Abba <b>went</b> and <b>asked</b> Rav Dimi a question: With regard to <b>an elephant that swallowed a wicker basket and excreted it</b> intact along <b>with its waste, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the vessel still susceptible to ritual impurity or is it considered digested and not susceptible to impurity? An answer <b>was not available to</b> Rav Dimi. Rav Dimi <b>said to</b> Rav Adda bar Abba: <b>Is the Master Rava,</b> i.e., are you Rava, as you have asked me such a difficult question? Rav Adda bar Abba <b>struck him on his shoe</b> in a disparaging way and <b>said to him: There is a great</b> difference <b>between me and Rava; but I am perforce your teacher, and Rava is your teacher’s teacher.</b>
Based on this exchange, Rav Adda bar Abba decided that Rav Dimi was not a great Torah scholar, and therefore <b>he did not reserve the market for him, and</b> Rav Dimi <b>lost his dried figs,</b> as they rotted. Rav Dimi <b>came before Rav Yosef</b> to complain, and <b>said to him: The Master</b> should <b>see what they did to me.</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: He Who did not delay</b> retribution for <b>the humiliation of the King of Edom should not delay</b> His response to <b>your humiliation,</b> but should punish whoever distressed you, <b>as it is written: “So says the Lord: For three transgressions of Moab, indeed for four I will not reverse for him, because he burned the bones of the King of Edom into lime”</b> (Amos 2:1).
The Gemara reports that <b>Rav Adda bar Abba died. Rav Yosef said: I punished him,</b> i.e., I am to blame for his death, <b>as I cursed him. Rav Dimi from Neharde’a said: I punished him, as he caused my loss of dried figs. Abaye said: I punished him,</b> i.e., he was punished on my account because he did not exhibit the proper respect for me. <b>As</b> Rav Adda bar Abba <b>said to the Sages: Instead of gnawing the bones in the school of Abaye, you</b> would do <b>better</b> to <b>eat fatty meat in the school of Rava,</b> i.e., it is preferable to study with Rava than with Abaye. <b>And Rava said: I punished him, as when he would go to the butcher to buy a piece of meat, he would say to the butchers: I will take meat before Rava’s servant, as I am greater than he is.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: I punished him,</b> i.e., he was punished because of me, <b>as Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak was the head of the <i>kalla</i></b> lectures, the gatherings for Torah study during Elul and Adar. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak would teach the students immediately following the lesson taught by the head of the academy. <b>Every day, before he went in for the <i>kalla</i></b> lecture, <b>he reviewed his lecture with Rav Adda bar Abba, and then he would enter</b> the study hall <b>for the <i>kalla</i></b> lecture.
On <b>that day Rav Pappa and Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, seized Rav Adda bar Abba, because they had not been present at the conclusion</b> of Rava’s lecture. <b>They said to him: Tell us how Rava stated these <i>halakhot</i> of animal tithe.</b> Rav Adda bar Abba <b>said to them: Rava said this and Rava said that. Meanwhile, it grew late for Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak, and Rav Adda bar Abba</b> had <b>not</b> yet <b>arrived.</b>
<b>The Sages said to Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak: Arise</b> and teach us, <b>as it is late for us. Why does the Master sit</b> and wait? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>said to them: I am sitting and waiting for the bier of Rav Adda bar Abba,</b> who has presumably died. <b>Meanwhile, a rumor emerged that Rav Adda bar Abba had</b> indeed <b>died.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And so too, it is reasonable</b> to conclude that <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak punished him,</b> i.e., he died as a result of Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak’s statement, as the unfortunate event occurred just as he announced that Rav Adda bar Abba’s bier was on its way.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One whose wall was close to the wall of another may not</b> build <b>another wall close</b> to the neighbor’s wall <b>unless he distances it four cubits from</b> the wall of the neighbor. And one who desires to build a wall opposite <b>the windows</b> of a neighbor’s house must distance the wall <b>four cubits</b> from the windows, <b>whether above, below, or opposite.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: Before addressing the construction of the second wall, one could ask: <b>And</b> with regard to the <b>first</b> man, <b>how did he place</b> his wall <b>close</b> to the neighbor’s wall in the first place? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>this is what</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying:</b>

Daf 22b

<b>One who comes to place</b> a wall <b>close</b> to his neighbor’s wall <b>may place</b> that wall <b>close</b> to the neighbor’s wall <b>only if he distances</b> his wall <b>four cubits from the existing wall.</b> Accordingly, the mishna is discussing one constructing a wall close to his neighbor’s wall the first time. <b>Rava objects to this</b> explanation: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches: One whose wall was near the wall of another,</b> which indicates that there had already been a wall there.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is teaching:</b> In a case of <b>one whose wall was near the wall of another at a distance of four cubits and</b> it <b>fell, he may not place another wall close</b> to his neighbor’s wall <b>unless he distances</b> the wall <b>four cubits from it. What is the reason</b> that this distance must be observed? The reason is <b>that walking here benefits there,</b> i.e., the ground is strengthened by people walking on the land in the area between the walls.
<b>Rav says: They taught</b> that one must leave a space of four cubits between his wall and that of his neighbor <b>only</b> if he builds it alongside <b>the wall of</b> his neighbor’s <b>garden,</b> where people do not usually walk due to the seeds. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the wall of a courtyard,</b> where people walk, <b>if he comes to place</b> his wall <b>close</b> by, <b>he may place</b> it <b>close</b> by. By contrast, <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> With regard to <b>both the wall of a garden and the wall of a courtyard, if one comes to place</b> his wall <b>close</b> by, <b>he may not place</b> his wall <b>close</b> by.
<b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: And</b> the two <i>amora’im</i> <b>do not disagree,</b> as they are referring to different cases. <b>This</b> statement of Rav is referring <b>to an old city,</b> whose ground is well trodden and stable, and <b>that</b> statement of Rabbi Oshaya is referring <b>to a new city,</b> where even the wall of a courtyard requires walking on its adjacent ground to strengthen it.
With regard to the claim that the <i>halakha</i> of the mishna is due to the need for space for people to walk on the ground between the walls, the Gemara asks: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: And one who desires to build a wall opposite <b>the windows</b> of a neighbor’s house must distance the wall <b>four cubits</b> from the windows, <b>whether above, below, or opposite. And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to this</b> ruling: Concerning the requirement of a distance <b>above,</b> the wall must be high <b>enough so that one cannot peer</b> into the window <b>and see</b> into the window; concerning the requirement of a distance <b>below,</b> the wall must be low <b>so that he will not</b> be able to <b>stand</b> on top of it <b>and see</b> into the window; <b>and</b> concerning the requirement of a distance <b>opposite,</b> one must distance the wall from the windows <b>so that it will not darken</b> his neighbor’s house by blocking the light that enters the house through the window.
The Gemara analyzes this statement: The <b>reason</b> that distance is required opposite the window is so <b>that he will not darken</b> his neighbor’s house by blocking the light that enters the house through the window, <b>but</b> it is <b>not due to</b> the fact that <b>walking</b> will strengthen the ground. The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a wall <b>that is positioned to the side,</b> i.e., perpendicular to the wall with the window in it, and therefore it blocks the light from entering the house through the window but does not prevent walking along the length of the neighbor’s wall.
The Gemara asks: <b>And how far</b> must one distance his wall if it is perpendicular to the other wall? <b>Yeiva, the father-in-law of Ashyan bar Nidbakh, says in the name of Rav:</b> As much <b>as the full width of the window.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why is this sufficient? <b>Can’t he</b> still <b>peer into</b> the window if he is that close? <b>Rav Zevid says:</b> This is referring <b>to one who slopes his wall,</b> i.e., he fashions an incline on the upper surface of the wall so that he will not be able to stand on top of it and look through the window.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that one must keep the wall <b>four cubits</b> away from the window? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; here,</b> he builds the wall <b>on one side</b> of the window, whereas <b>there,</b> in the mishna, he builds walls <b>on two sides</b> of the window. In the latter case, if he builds the walls any closer he will block the light from entering the house through the window even if they are perpendicular.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a further difficulty from the mishna below with regard to the claim that the requisite gap between the walls is for the purpose of walking, as the mishna teaches: <b>And</b> one must distance his <b>wall four cubits from a roof gutter so that</b> his neighbor <b>can lean a ladder</b> in the empty space to clean and repair the gutter. The Gemara analyzes this statement: The <b>reason</b> this distance is required is <b>due to</b> the fact that he will be able to lean <b>a ladder, but</b> it is <b>not due to</b> the fact that <b>walking</b> will strengthen the ground. The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with a sloping roof gutter,</b> which protrudes beyond the boundary of the wall. <b>As</b> in this case, <b>if</b> the reason for distancing the wall <b>is due to walking, one can walk back and forth beneath it.</b> Nevertheless, a distance of four cubits from the roof gutter is required so that repairs can be performed.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One must distance</b> his <b>ladder four cubits from</b> a neighbor’s <b>dovecote so that a mongoose will not</b> be able to <b>jump</b> from the ladder to the dovecote and devour the birds. <b>And</b> one must distance his <b>wall four cubits from a roof gutter, so that</b> the neighbor <b>can lean a ladder</b> in the empty space to clean and repair the gutter.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, as, if</b> it were in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, doesn’t</b> he <b>say</b> with regard to planting a tree next to a neighbor’s cistern: <b>This one digs within his</b> land, <b>and that one plants within his</b> land, and neither individual need consider what is happening in the property of the other?
The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna follows the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> as <b>didn’t Rav Ashi say: When we were</b> studying <b>in the study hall of Rav Kahana, he would say</b> to us that <b>Rabbi Yosei concedes with regard to his arrows,</b> i.e., he concedes that one must distance himself if his actions will cause damage to his neighbor. <b>Here too, sometimes when he places</b> the ladder, the mongoose might be <b>sitting in a hole and</b> will immediately <b>jump</b> up and climb the ladder to the dovecote. The Gemara challenges: <b>But that is indirect</b> damage, as he is not the immediate cause. <b>Rav Tovi bar Mattana said: That is to say</b> that it <b>is prohibited</b> to cause even <b>indirect damage.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Yosef had certain small palm trees [<i>talei</i>],</b> and

Daf 23a

<b>bloodletters</b> would <b>come and sit beneath them</b> and perform their work there, <b>and crows</b> would <b>come, eat the blood, and fly up to the palm trees and damage the dates. Rav Yosef said to</b> the bloodletters: <b>Remove these crowing</b> birds <b>from here,</b> i.e., leave in order to avoid further damage. <b>Abaye said to him: But it is an indirect</b> action, as the bloodletters themselves are not damaging the dates. Rav Yosef <b>said to him</b> that <b>Rav Tovi bar Mattana said</b> as follows: <b>That is to say</b> that it <b>is prohibited</b> to cause even <b>indirect damage.</b>
Abaye said to Rav Yosef: <b>But they have established an acquired privilege</b> to use that particular spot for their work. Rav Yosef replied: <b>Doesn’t Rav Naḥman say</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: There is no acquired privilege</b> of use <b>in</b> cases of <b>damage,</b> i.e., an established situation may not be allowed to continue in the event that damage results. Abaye inquired further: <b>But wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> statement of Rav Naḥman that <b>Rav Mari said</b> it is referring specifically <b>to smoke, and Rav Zevid said</b> it is referring <b>to a bathroom?</b> In other words, this principle was stated specifically in the context of damage caused by these substances. Rav Yosef <b>said to him: For me, as I am sensitive, these are like smoke and a bathroom to me,</b> which is why I have the right to demand that the bloodletters leave.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One must distance a dovecote fifty cubits from the city</b> to prevent doves from eating seeds in the town. <b>And a person should not establish a dovecote within his own</b> property <b>unless he has fifty cubits in each direction</b> between the dovecote and the edge of his property. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that one must have surrounding the dovecote the <b>area required for sowing four <i>kor</i></b> of seed on each side, which generally extends <b>as far as a dove flies</b> in a single flight. <b>And if one bought</b> the dovecote with the land, <b>he has the acquired privilege</b> of its use <b>even if</b> it has surrounding it only the <b>area required for sowing a quarter-<i>kav</i> of seed [<i>beit rova</i>]</b> around it, and he need not remove it from there.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Must one distance a dovecote only <b>fifty cubits</b> from the city <b>and no more?</b> Is that as far as one can expect a dove to fly? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 79b): One <b>may spread out traps [<i>neshavin</i>] for doves only if</b> this was performed <b>at a distance of</b> at least <b>thirty <i>ris</i>,</b> or four <i>mil</i>, which is eight thousand cubits, <b>from</b> any <b>settled area,</b> to avoid catching birds that belong to another. Apparently, doves fly a distance of thirty <i>ris</i>, whereas the mishna here states fifty cubits.
<b>Abaye said:</b> Doves do <b>fly great distances,</b> which is why one must avoid catching others’ birds by keeping traps thirty <i>ris</i> away from settled areas. <b>But</b> as they eat along their way, <b>their stomachs are filled</b> after a distance of <b>fifty cubits,</b> at which point they will do no more damage to seeds. The Gemara asks: <b>And do they fly</b> only <b>thirty <i>ris</i> and no more? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And in a settled area,</b> one <b>may not spread out</b> a trap <b>even</b> if the area under his control extends as far as <b>one hundred <i>mil</i></b> in each direction? <b>Rav Yosef says:</b> That <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a settled area of vineyards,</b> i.e., a contiguous region of vineyards and gardens. In that case the doves pass from place to place even over a great distance.
<b>Rava said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to a settled area of dovecotes,</b> i.e., where many dovecotes are distributed. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to Rava, <b>let</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>derive</b> that one may not establish a new dovecote there <b>due to</b> the other <b>dovecotes themselves,</b> as he will trap doves belonging to others. The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that this is referring to <b>his own</b> dovecotes. <b>And if you wish, say</b> it is referring to the dovecotes of <b>a gentile,</b> whose property one is not obligated to protect from harm. <b>And if you wish, say</b> it is referring <b>to ownerless</b> dovecotes.
§ <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that one must have surrounding the dovecote the <b>area required for sowing four <i>kor</i></b> of seed on each side, which is as far as a dove flies in a single flight. And if one bought the dovecote with the land, he has the acquired privilege of its use. <b>Rav Pappa said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Zevid: That is to say</b> that a court <b>issues a claim</b> on behalf <b>of a buyer, and issues a claim</b> on behalf <b>of an heir.</b> This is referring to the <i>halakha</i> of taking possession. If one has been physically in possession of an item for a period of time, generally three years, this serves as proof that he is in fact the legal owner. This possession must be accompanied by a claim of how one acquired the item; he cannot simply state that no one protested his possessing the item for three years. Rav Pappa is saying that the court will lodge a claim on behalf of a buyer or heir that they acquired the item from someone who was the owner, just as here the court assumes that the previous owner of the dovecote came to an agreement with his neighbors that he may use it.
The Gemara asks: Why is it necessary for Rav Pappa to state this <i>halakha</i>? <b>We</b> already <b>learn</b> this with regard to <b>an heir</b> (41a): In the case of land <b>that comes as an inheritance, one is not required to make a claim</b> as to how the land came into his benefactor’s possession when one’s ownership of the land is challenged. The Gemara answers: <b>It was necessary for him</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a buyer.</b> The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>a buyer as well, we learn</b> this in a mishna (60a): If one <b>bought a courtyard in which there are projections and balconies [<i>ugzuztraot</i>]</b> extending into the public domain, this courtyard <b>retains its presumptive status,</b> i.e., the owner has the acquired privilege of their use, and the court does not demand their removal.
The Gemara answers: It was <b>necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna to state this <i>halakha</i> in both cases, <b>as, if he had taught us this</b> only <b>there,</b> in that mishna, one might have said that it applies specifically <b>with regard to</b> a protrusion or a balcony that extends into <b>the public domain, as</b> one can <b>say</b> that perhaps <b>it is</b> a case where the seller had <b>drawn back into his own</b> land before adding the projections and balconies, and they in fact do not extend into the public thoroughfare. <b>Alternatively,</b> perhaps <b>the public waived</b> their right <b>to him</b> and allowed him to place them over the common area, as otherwise they would have protested. <b>But here,</b> where he causes damage to private individuals, one might have thought that the buyer does <b>not</b> have a privilege of use, and therefore the mishna teaches us otherwise.
<b>And if he had taught this</b> only in the mishna <b>here,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>since</b> the party potentially suffering damage <b>is an individual,</b> the owner of the dovecote <b>appeased</b> his neighbor by paying him to permit him to construct it. <b>Alternatively,</b> the neighbor might have <b>waived</b> his right <b>to him. But</b> in a case where damage is caused to <b>the public,</b> one might argue: <b>Whom did he appease, and who yielded</b> to him? Consequently, one might <b>say</b> that the purchaser does <b>not</b> retain the privilege of use. Therefore, it is <b>necessary</b> for the <i>tanna</i> to state the <i>halakha</i> in this case as well.
§ The mishna teaches that if one bought the dovecote with the land, <b>he has the acquired privilege</b> of use. The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says: There is no acquired privilege</b> of use <b>for</b> cases of <b>damage?</b> Why should he retain his acquired privilege of use when his doves cause damage? <b>Rav Mari said:</b> Rav Naḥman’s statement is referring specifically <b>to smoke,</b> which causes serious damage, and that is why it overrides an acquired privilege. <b>Rav Zevid said:</b> It is referring <b>to a bathroom,</b> whose odor is particularly strong.

Daf 23b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to a dove <b>chick [<i>nippul</i>] that was found within fifty cubits</b> of a dovecote, <b>it belongs to the owner of the dovecote.</b> If it was found <b>beyond fifty cubits</b> from a dovecote, <b>it belongs to its finder.</b> In a case where it <b>was found between two dovecotes,</b> if it was <b>close to this one,</b> it belongs <b>to</b> the owner of this dovecote; if it was <b>close to that one,</b> it belongs <b>to</b> the owner of that dovecote. If it was <b>half and half,</b> i.e., equidistant from the two dovecotes, <b>the two</b> owners <b>divide</b> the value of the chick.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> When resolving an uncertainty with regard to the halakhic status of an item, e.g., a found item, if the status of the <b>majority</b> of like items indicates that it has one status <b>but</b> the item in question is <b>proximate</b> to a source that indicates otherwise, one <b>follows the majority. And even though</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>majority</b> applies <b>by Torah law and</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of proximity</b> also applies <b>by Torah law, even so the majority is preferable.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises an objection</b> from the Torah’s statement with regard to a murder victim where the identity of the murderer is unknown. In a case of this kind, the court measures the distances between the corpse and the nearby towns, in order to determine which town is closest and must consequently perform the rite of the heifer whose neck is broken. The verse states: <b>“And it shall be, that the city that is nearest to the slain man,</b> the Elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd…and shall break the heifer’s neck” (Deuteronomy 21:3–4). <b>And</b> this town is chosen <b>even though there</b> might <b>be another</b> town <b>that is larger</b> in population <b>than it.</b> According to Rabbi Ḥanina, in a case of this kind one should follow the majority.
The Gemara answers: This verse is referring to a situation <b>where there is no</b> other town that is larger than that one. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> still, if one follows the majority, why should the court follow the closest city? <b>Let us follow the majority of the world,</b> as most people are found elsewhere. The Gemara answers: This is referring <b>to</b> a case where the city <b>sits</b> in isolation <b>between mountains,</b> and therefore it is unlikely that the murderer arrived from elsewhere.
The Gemara continues to discuss the issue of majority as opposed to proximity. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna: With regard to a dove <b>chick that was found within fifty cubits</b> of a dovecote, <b>it belongs to the owner of the dovecote. And</b> as the mishna does not make a distinction between different cases, it indicates that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though there is another</b> dovecote <b>that is larger than</b> the proximate one in terms of number of birds. This shows that closeness, not majority, is the determining factor. The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where there is no</b> other dovecote in the area.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: If it was found <b>beyond fifty cubits</b> from a dovecote, <b>it belongs to its finder. And if there is no</b> other dovecote in the area, it <b>certainly fell from that</b> dovecote. How, then, can it be given to the finder? The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with</b> a chick that <b>hops</b> from place to place but does not yet fly. <b>As Rav Ukva bar Ḥama says:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> creature <b>that hops,</b> it <b>does not hop more than fifty</b> cubits. Consequently, any bird found within fifty cubits of a dovecote is assumed to have come from there. If it is farther away than that, it likely came from elsewhere or was dropped by travelers.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>one leg</b> of the chick was <b>within fifty cubits</b> of the dovecote, <b>and one leg</b> was <b>beyond fifty cubits, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara comments: <b>And it was for</b> his question about <b>this</b> far-fetched scenario <b>that they removed Rabbi Yirmeya from the study hall,</b> as he was apparently wasting the Sages’ time.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the mishna: In a case where it <b>was found between two dovecotes,</b> if it was <b>close to this one,</b> it belongs <b>to</b> the owner of this dovecote; if it was <b>close to that one,</b> it belongs <b>to</b> the owner of that dovecote. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though one of them is greater</b> in number of birds <b>than the other one.</b> Apparently, one rules based on proximity, not majority. The Gemara explains: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a situation <b>where the two</b> dovecotes <b>are equal</b> in size. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even so, why should one follow the closer dovecote? <b>Let us follow the majority of the world,</b> as there are many other dovecotes besides these, and the number of doves they contain is greater. The Gemara responds: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b>

Daf 24a

We are dealing <b>with a path that</b> passes between <b>vineyards,</b> and these two dovecotes are situated there. <b>As, if it is so that</b> you claim the chick <b>came from</b> anywhere else in <b>the world, since it</b> only <b>hops, it could not have come</b> there. The reason is <b>that any</b> bird <b>that hops and turns</b> and <b>sees its nest</b> will continue <b>to hop; but if it does not</b> see its nest because it has gone too far, <b>it will not hop</b> farther. Consequently, this found chick that hops must have come from one of these two dovecotes.
<b>Abaye said: We learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 17b) <b>as well</b> that one follows the majority rather than proximity: With regard to <b>blood that is found in the corridor [<i>baperozdor</i>],</b> i.e., the cervical canal, and <b>it is uncertain</b> whether or not it is menstrual blood, it is <b>ritually impure</b> as menstrual blood, <b>as</b> there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>it</b> came <b>from</b> the uterus, which is <b>the source</b> of menstrual blood. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though there is an upper chamber,</b> which empties into the canal, <b>which is closer.</b>
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye, in response to this claim: <b>You state</b> a proof from a case where the factors of <b>majority and frequency</b> are both present. When there is <b>majority and frequency, there is no one who says</b> that one ignores the majority and follows proximity. Here, not only is the blood from the uterus greater in quantity, it also passes through the canal more frequently, as blood generally does not come from the upper chamber.
Rava cites a proof for his statement. <b>As Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches: Blood that is found in the corridor</b> is considered definite menstrual blood, and therefore if she engages in sexual intercourse, both she and her partner would be <b>liable as a result of it</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for entering the Temple</b> intentionally when ritually impure or to bring an offering for entering unwittingly. <b>And one burns <i>teruma</i> due to it,</b> if the woman touches such produce. Evidently, the status of this blood is not considered uncertain.
<b>And Rava says: Learn from</b> that which <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya</b> said <b>three</b> conclusions: <b>Learn from</b> his statement that when the relevant factors are <b>majority and proximity, follow the majority; and learn from</b> his statement that the <i>halakha</i> that one follows <b>the majority</b> applies <b>by Torah law,</b> as <i>teruma</i> is burned in this case on account of the blood and she is liable to receive <i>karet</i> if she enters the Temple in this state; <b>and learn from</b> his statement that <b>there is</b> a source <b>for</b> that <b>which Rabbi Zeira</b> said.
This statement of Rabbi Zeira was issued in reference to a case discussed in tractate <i>Ketubot</i> (15a). If there are ten stores in a city, nine of which sell kosher meat and one of which sells non-kosher meat, and one found meat outside the stores and he does not know from which store it came, one follows the majority. The Gemara there suggests that perhaps one follows the majority only in a case where the gates of the city are unlocked, when the meat could have come to the city from the majority of kosher meat outside in a circumstance where the majority of the meat sold in the surrounding area was kosher. In this case there are two majorities, the majority of kosher meat stores inside the city, and the majority from outside. The Gemara there explains <b>that Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>even if the city gates are locked</b> one follows the majority, and the meat is kosher, as there is a no need for a double majority.
The Gemara elaborates: The two cases are analogous, <b>as the woman</b> here <b>is considered like the locked gates of the city,</b> i.e., there is only a single majority, <b>and even so we follow the majority.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But Rava is the one who says</b> with regard to the case of the blood that when there is <b>majority and frequency, there is no</b> one <b>who says</b> that one ignores the majority and follows the proximity. In other words, Rava rejected this case as proof of the principle that one follows the majority even when it is not frequent. Here, by contrast, Rava claims that one can learn from the ruling of Rabbi Ḥiyya that one follows the majority by Torah law. The Gemara answers: <b>Rava retracted that</b> claim in favor of the opinion that one follows the majority in all cases.
§ <b>It was stated:</b> In the case of <b>a barrel</b> of wine <b>that</b> was found <b>floating in a river,</b> and the status of the wine was unknown, <b>Rav says:</b> If it was <b>found opposite a town of which the majority</b> of residents <b>are Jews,</b> the wine is <b>permitted,</b> as it can be assumed that the wine belongs to a Jew. If it was <b>found opposite a town of which the majority are gentiles, it is forbidden,</b> as it presumably belongs to a gentile. <b>And Shmuel says: It is forbidden even</b> if it was <b>found opposite a town of which the majority are Jews.</b> Why? Regardless of where it was found, one can <b>say</b> that <b>it came from that</b> place called <b>Dekira,</b> where the majority of people are gentiles. In other words, there is a distinct possibility that a floating barrel came from far away.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say that</b> Rav and Shmuel <b>disagree with regard to</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> in <b>that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> and he rules based on the majority, which in this case includes even distant locales, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> which is why he rules based on proximity.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No; everyone agrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina, and here they disagree about this: As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav, <b>holds</b> that <b>if it is so, that</b> the barrel <b>came from that</b> place called <b>Dekira,</b> this cannot be, as <b>the currents and bays</b> of the river, where the river flow is weak, <b>would have sunk it.</b> Therefore, it is logical that the barrel came from a nearby town. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Shmuel, <b>holds</b> that perhaps <b>the force of the river caught</b> the barrel <b>and brought it,</b> as it is evident that the flow of a river can bring items from far away.
The Gemara relates that <b>Ravina</b> deemed <b>permitted a certain barrel of wine that was found</b> hidden <b>in a vineyard</b> where there were <b><i>orla</i></b> grapes, and he was not concerned that the wine might be from the grapes of that vineyard. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that this is <b>because he holds</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina</b> that one follows the majority of vineyards, which are not <i>orla</i>, rather than proximity?
The Gemara answers: It <b>is different there, as, if</b> thieves <b>had stolen</b> the barrel <b>from</b> that very vineyard <b>they would not have hidden it there.</b> Since the barrel was hidden there, it is reasonable to assume that it was stolen from somewhere else. The Gemara comments: <b>And this matter,</b> that thieves would not hide a stolen barrel in the same vineyard from which they stole it, <b>applies</b> only <b>to wine; but they</b> would <b>hide grapes</b> there, as grapes are not readily identifiable by the owner. Consequently, there is a concern that grapes found hidden there might be from that same vineyard.
The Gemara further relates that <b>there were these jugs of wine that were found between vines [<i>bei kofa’ei</i>]</b> of a Jew. <b>Rava</b> deemed the contents <b>permitted</b> and was unconcerned that they might be wine owned by a gentile. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that Rava <b>does not hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who says that one follows the majority, in this case gentiles? The Gemara answers: <b>There it is different, as the majority</b>

Daf 24b

<b>of those who pour wine</b> from barrels into jugs <b>are Jews,</b> and therefore it is reasonable that the wine belongs to a Jew. The Gemara comments: <b>And this matter</b> applies <b>only to large</b> jugs. <b>But</b> if they were <b>small</b> jugs, one can <b>say</b> that <b>they were dropped by travelers,</b> most of whom are gentiles, and therefore the jugs of wine are forbidden. <b>And if there are large</b> jugs <b>among</b> the found jugs, <b>say</b> that they all belong to Jews, as travelers do not usually carry large jugs; it can be assumed that the small ones <b>were placed to balance</b> the donkey’s load, and the jugs all fell together.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One must distance a tree twenty-five cubits from the city, and</b> in the cases <b>of a carob tree and of a sycamore tree,</b> which have a great many branches, they must be distanced <b>fifty cubits. Abba Shaul says: Every barren tree</b> must be distanced <b>fifty cubits. And if the city preceded</b> the tree, as one later planted the tree alongside the city, he <b>cuts down</b> the tree, <b>and</b> the city <b>does not give money</b> to the tree’s owner in compensation. <b>And if the tree preceded</b> the city, which expanded after one planted the tree until it reached the tree, he <b>cuts down</b> the tree <b>and</b> the city <b>gives money</b> to its owner. If it is <b>uncertain whether this one was first or that one was first,</b> he <b>cuts down</b> the tree <b>and</b> the city <b>does not give money.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that one must distance a tree from a city? <b>Ulla says:</b> It is <b>due to the beauty of the city,</b> as it is unattractive for a city’s walls to be obscured by tree branches. The Gemara suggests: <b>And let him derive</b> this <i>halakha</i> from the statement in tractate <i>Arakhin</i> (33b) <b>that one may neither convert a field</b> of a city into <b>an open area</b> surrounding the city, <b>nor may one</b> convert <b>an open area</b> into <b>a field,</b> as these have fixed places and measurements (see Numbers 35:1–8). If one plants trees in a city’s open area, he thereby turns the open area into a field.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to supply the reason given by Ulla <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, who says:</b> One <b>may convert a field</b> into <b>an open area, and an open area</b> into <b>a field. Here, we do not</b> plant trees, <b>due to the beauty of the city.</b>
<b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis as well, who say</b> that <b>one may not convert a field</b> into <b>an open area, nor</b> convert <b>an open area</b> into <b>a field,</b> one can say that <b>this matter</b> applies only to <b>seeds,</b> i.e., one may not plant seeds in a city’s open area and thereby turn it into a field. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>trees, we do</b> plant them in an open area. <b>But here</b> we do <b>not</b> plant trees, <b>due to the beauty of the city.</b>
<b>And from where do you say,</b> i.e., on what basis do you maintain, <b>that</b> there is <b>a difference between seeds and trees? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that discusses the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat: With regard to <b>an enclosure [<i>karpef</i> ]</b> whose area is <b>greater than two <i>beit se’a</i></b> but <b>that was enclosed</b> from the outset <b>for the purpose of residence,</b> it is permitted to carry within it on Shabbat regardless of its size, as it is considered a private domain.
If subsequently <b>the greater part of it was sown</b> with seed crops, <b>it is</b> considered <b>like a garden,</b> which is not a place of residence, <b>and it is prohibited</b> to carry anything within it on Shabbat. If <b>the greater part of it was planted</b> with trees, <b>it is</b> considered <b>like a courtyard,</b> which is a place of dwelling, <b>and it is permitted</b> to carry there on Shabbat. This shows that planting trees in an enclosure does not transform the area into a field, as is the case when seeds are planted.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And if the city preceded</b> the tree he <b>cuts down</b> the tree, <b>and</b> the city <b>does not give money.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different with regard to a cistern, that</b> the <i>tanna</i> of another mishna (25b) <b>teaches</b> that if one plants a tree next to a neighbor’s existing cistern, the owner of the tree <b>cuts down</b> the tree <b>and</b> the owner of the cistern <b>gives money; and what is different here that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> that the owner of the tree <b>cuts down</b> the tree <b>and</b> the city <b>does not give money?</b>
<b>Rav Kahana said,</b> citing a popular aphorism: <b>A pot belonging to partners is neither hot nor cold,</b> i.e., no one takes responsibility for an item that belongs to several people, as opposed to a single individual. Here too, there is no specific person who will pay for the tree.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the difficulty</b> to begin with? <b>Perhaps damage</b> caused <b>to public</b> property <b>is different from damage</b> caused to the property <b>of an individual.</b> Consequently, when one’s tree causes damage to the public he is not compensated for having to cut it down, whereas he does receive payment when his tree damages a private cistern.
<b>Rather, if Rav Kahana’s</b> comment <b>was stated</b> in this context, <b>it was stated about the latter clause: If the tree preceded</b> the city, he <b>cuts down</b> the tree <b>and</b> the city <b>gives money</b> to its owner. Concerning this <i>halakha</i> one could ask: <b>And let</b> the tree owner <b>say to</b> the city residents: <b>Give me money first and then I will cut down</b> the tree. In this context, <b>Rav Kahana said: A pot belonging to partners is neither hot nor cold.</b> If the owner of the tree is entitled to wait until he had first collects money, a good deal of time would pass before the tree would be cut down. Therefore, a community need not collect money and pay immediately, unlike an individual.
§ The mishna teaches that if it is <b>uncertain whether this one was first or that one was first,</b> he <b>cuts down</b> the tree <b>and</b> the city <b>does not give money.</b> The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> that of a tree alongside <b>a cistern,</b> concerning <b>which you said</b> in the mishna (25b) that in a case of uncertainty the owner of the tree need <b>not cut down</b> the tree?
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> if it were a case <b>of certainty</b> the tree would <b>not</b> be <b>subject to being cut down;</b> therefore, in a case <b>of uncertainty too, we do not say to</b> the owner of the tree: <b>Cut</b> it <b>down.</b> In that case, if the tree preceded the cistern, the owner of the tree would not be required to cut it down. <b>Here,</b> if it were a case <b>of certainty,</b> the tree would be <b>subject to being cut down</b> even if it preceded the city, and the only uncertainty is whether or not the owner of the tree would need to be compensated. Consequently, in a case <b>of uncertainty too, we say to</b> the owner of the tree: <b>Cut</b> it <b>down. And if</b> the owner of the tree lodges a claim <b>due</b> to the <b>value</b> of the tree, as he wants compensation for it, <b>we say to him: Bring proof</b> that your tree came first, <b>and take</b> your money. Since he has no proof, he does not receive any money.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One must distance a permanent threshing floor fifty cubits from the city,</b> so that the chaff will not harm the city’s residents. Furthermore, <b>a person should not establish a permanent threshing floor</b> even <b>on his own</b> property <b>unless he has fifty cubits</b> of open space <b>in every direction. And one must distance</b> a threshing floor <b>from the plantings of another and from</b> another’s <b>plowed field</b> far <b>enough that it does not cause damage.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause</b> of the mishna, which states a fixed measurement for the distance of a threshing floor from a city, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> which does not provide a measurement but simply states in general terms: Enough that it does not cause damage? <b>Abaye said:</b> In <b>the latter clause we arrive at</b> the case of <b>a threshing floor that is not permanent.</b> This threshing floor must be far enough from a neighbor that it does not cause damage to his property.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>a threshing floor that is not permanent? Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> It refers to <b>any</b> threshing floor <b>where</b> one processes such a small quantity of grain that <b>he does not winnow with a winnowing shovel,</b> but employs some other method that does not scatter the chaff as far. This is one resolution of the contradiction.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the phrase: Enough that it does not cause damage, is not referring to a distance but provides an explanation. In other words, the <i>tanna</i> <b>is saying: What is the reason</b> for the ruling of the first clause, as follows: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>one must distance a permanent threshing floor fifty cubits from the city?</b> It must be far <b>enough</b> away <b>that it does not cause damage.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against the opinion of Abaye from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One must distance a permanent threshing floor fifty cubits from the city; and just as one distances</b> it <b>fifty cubits from the city, so too does one distance</b> it <b>fifty cubits from the gourds, cucumbers, plantings, and plowed field of another, enough that it does not cause damage. Granted,</b> this <b>works out well according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ashi,</b> as he claims that in both clauses the same distance is required: One must move a threshing floor fifty cubits from a plowed field and from those plantings. <b>But according to</b> the explanation of <b>Abaye,</b> it is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara comments: Indeed, it is <b>difficult.</b>
The Gemara asks with regard to the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Granted,</b> one must distance his threshing floor <b>from his</b> neighbor’s <b>cucumbers and gourds, as the chaff</b> from the threshing floor <b>goes</b> and penetrates <b>into the heart</b> of the flower <b>and dries it out. But why</b> must one distance the threshing floor <b>from</b> another’s <b>plowed field? Rabbi Abba bar Zavda said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Abba bar Zutra:</b> It is <b>because</b>

Daf 25a

<b>he turns it</b> into <b>manure,</b> i.e., the chaff acts like manure, and an excessive amount of manure damages the seeds.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One must distance</b> animal <b>carcasses, and graves, and a tannery [<i>haburseki</i>],</b> a place where hides are processed, <b>fifty cubits from the city. One may establish a tannery only on the east side of the city,</b> because winds usually blow from the west and the foul smells would therefore be blown away from the residential area. <b>Rabbi Akiva says: One may establish</b> a tannery <b>on any side</b> of a city <b>except for the west,</b> as the winds blowing from that direction will bring the odors into the city, <b>and one must distance</b> it <b>fifty cubits</b> from the city. <b>One must distance from vegetables water in which flax is steeped,</b> because this water ruins them; <b>and</b> likewise one must distance <b>leeks from onions, and mustard from bees. And Rabbi Yosei permits</b> one not to do so in the case <b>of mustard.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>what</b> case <b>is Rabbi Akiva speaking?</b> Did he mean that <b>one may establish</b> a tannery <b>on any side</b> of a city, <b>and</b> one may even <b>place</b> the tannery <b>close</b> to the city, <b>except for the west side,</b> where <b>one must establish it at a distance of fifty cubits? Or perhaps</b> he meant that <b>one may establish</b> a tannery <b>on any side and distance it fifty cubits, except for the west side,</b> where one <b>may not establish</b> a tannery <b>at all.</b>
The Gemara cites a proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Akiva says</b> that <b>one may establish</b> a tannery <b>on any side</b> of the city <b>and distance it fifty cubits, except for the west side,</b> where one <b>may not establish</b> a tannery <b>at all, because</b> the western wind is <b>frequent.</b>
§ With regard to the last statement of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: What</b> does <b>frequent</b> mean in this context? <b>If we say</b> it means <b>frequent among the winds,</b> i.e., this wind blows all the time, that is difficult. <b>But doesn’t Rav Ḥanan bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rav says: Four winds blow every day</b> from different directions, <b>and the northern wind</b> blows <b>with each of</b> the other three; <b>as, if this were not so,</b> i.e., if it did not blow, <b>the world would not exist for even one hour,</b> as the northern wind is pleasant and tempers the bitter effects of the other winds. <b>And the southern wind</b> is <b>harsher than all of them, and were it not</b> for the angel named <b><i>Ben Netz</i>,</b> who <b>stops it</b> from blowing even harder, it would <b>destroy the</b> entire <b>world, as it is stated: “Does the hawk [<i>netz</i>] soar by your wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?”</b> (Job 39:26). This indicates that the northern wind is the most constant, not the western wind.
<b>Rather, what</b> is the meaning of <b>frequent?</b> It means <b>frequent with the Divine Presence,</b> i.e., the Divine Presence is found on the western side, and therefore it is inappropriate to set up a tannery there with its foul odors. <b>As Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Come and let us be grateful to our ancestors who revealed</b> to us <b>the place of prayer, as it is written: “And the hosts of heaven bow down to You”</b> (Nehemiah 9:6). Since the celestial bodies move from east to west, they bow in that direction, which indicates that the Divine Presence is in the west.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov objects to this: But perhaps</b> the celestial bodies are <b>like a servant who receives a gift from his master and walks backward</b> while <b>bowing.</b> If so, the Divine Presence is in the east and the celestial bodies are moving backward. The Gemara comments: Indeed, this is <b>difficult,</b> i.e., the verse does not provide a definitive proof.
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Oshaya holds</b> that <b>the Divine Presence</b> is found <b>in every place, as Rabbi Oshaya says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “You are the Lord, even You alone, You have made heaven…</b>You preserve them all alive and the hosts of heaven bow down to You” (Nehemiah 9:6)? This indicates that <b>Your messengers are not like the messengers of flesh and blood. The messengers of flesh and blood return to the place from where they were sent</b> to report on <b>their mission. But Your messengers return</b> and report on <b>their mission from the</b> very same <b>place</b> to <b>which they are sent, as it is stated “Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go out and say to you: Here we are?”</b> (Job 38:35). The verse <b>does not state: They will come and say,</b> i.e., they do not return to their point of departure, <b>but: “They may go out and say,”</b> which <b>teaches that the Divine Presence</b> is found <b>in every place.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And Rabbi Yishmael, too, holds</b> that <b>the Divine Presence</b> is <b>in every place, as</b> one of the Sages of <b>the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that the Divine Presence</b> is <b>in every place? As it is stated: “And behold the angel who spoke with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him”</b> (Zechariah 2:7). Although both angels were coming from the Divine Presence, the verse <b>does not state: After him, but: “To meet him,”</b> which <b>teaches that the Divine Presence</b> is <b>in every place,</b> and therefore the angels depart for their missions from every place.
<b>And Rav Sheshet, too, holds</b> that <b>the Divine Presence</b> is <b>in every place, as Rav Sheshet said to his servant: Set me facing any direction</b> to pray <b>except for the east.</b> Rav Sheshet, who was blind, required the assistance of his aide to prepare for prayer. He explained to his servant: <b>And</b> the reason I do not wish to face east is <b>not because it does not contain the Divine Presence, but because the heretics instruct</b> people to pray <b>in that</b> direction.
<b>But Rabbi Abbahu says: The Divine Presence</b> is <b>in the west, as Rabbi Abbahu says: What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>oriyya</i>,</b> which is a name for the west? It means <b>the air of God [<i>avir Yah</i>],</b> i.e., this is the place of the Divine Presence.
The Gemara cites a statement connected to the four winds. <b>Rav Yehuda said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “My doctrine shall drop as the rain,</b> my speech shall distill as the dew; as the small rain upon the tender growth, and as the showers upon the herb” (Deuteronomy 32:2)? “My doctrine shall drop [<i>ya’arof</i> ] as the rain”; <b>this is the western wind, which comes from the back of [<i>me’orpo</i>] the world,</b> as the west is also referred to as the back.
<b>“My speech shall distill [<i>tizzal</i>] as the dew”; this is the northern wind, which</b> brings dry air that reduces the rain and grain and thereby <b>devalues [<i>mazzelet</i>] gold.</b> When grain crops are reduced their price appreciates, and consequently the value of gold decreases. <b>And in addition, it says: “You who lavish [<i>hazzalim</i>] gold out of the bag”</b> (Isaiah 46:6).
<b>“As the small rain [<i>kisirim</i>] upon the tender growth”; this is the eastern wind that rages through [<i>maseret</i>] the entire world like a demon [<i>sa’ir</i>]</b> when it blows strongly. <b>“And as the showers upon the herb”; this is the southern wind, which raises showers and causes herbs to grow.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The <b>world</b>

Daf 25b

<b>is similar to</b> a partially enclosed <b>veranda [<i>le’akhsadra</i>],</b> enclosed on three sides, <b>and the northern side</b> of the world <b>is not enclosed</b> with a partition like the other directions. The sun begins its revolution in the east and passes to the south and the west, <b>and once the sun reaches the northwestern corner it turns around and ascends</b> throughout the night <b>above the sky</b> to the east side and does not pass the north side. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua says: The world is similar to a small tent [<i>lekubba</i>], and the north side is enclosed</b> with a partition as well, <b>but once the sun reaches the northwestern corner</b> it emerges from this small tent, and <b>circles and passes behind the dome,</b> i.e., outside the northern partition, until it reaches the east.
<b>As it is stated:</b> “The sun also rises and the sun goes down, and hastens to its place, where it rises again. <b>It goes toward the south, and turns about to the north;</b> round and round goes the wind, and on its circuits the wind returns” (Ecclesiastes 1:5–6). The verse is understood as describing the sun’s movements, as follows: <b>“It goes toward the south” during the day, “and turns about to the north,”</b> on the outside of the firmament, <b>at night. “Round and round goes the wind [<i>ruaḥ</i>] and the wind returns again to its circuits”;</b> as the word <i>ruaḥ</i> can also mean direction or side, Rabbi Yehoshua explains that <b>these are the face of the east and the face of the west. Sometimes,</b> in the short winter days, the sun <b>turns about them</b> without being seen, <b>and sometimes,</b> in the long summer days, <b>it traverses them</b> visibly.
The <i>baraita</i> continues:  <b>He would say.</b> Before continuing its citation, the Gemara interjects: In this statement,  <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> that the world is like a partially enclosed veranda. The Gemara resumes its citation of the baraita: There is proof from a verse that the north side is open: <b>“Out of the chamber comes the storm”; this is the southern side</b> that forms a room with the other two sides. <b>“And cold out of the dispersed parts”</b> (Job 37:9); <b>this is the northern side,</b> which is open, and from which a cold wind comes. <b>“By the breath of God ice is given”; this is the western side. “And the breadth of the waters is straitened”</b> (Job 37:10); <b>this is the eastern side,</b> from which the rains come.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t the Master say</b> that <b>the southern wind raises showers and causes herbs to grow?</b> The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult: This</b> is referring to <b>rain that falls gently,</b> which waters plants and brings growth; <b>that</b> is referring to <b>a downpour</b> of rain that causes damage.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Out of the north comes gold”</b> (Job 37:22)? <b>This is the northern wind, which devalues gold</b> by causing a drought that raises the price of grain. <b>And, in addition, it says: “You who lavish gold out of the bag”</b> (Isaiah 46:6).
§ <b>Rafram bar Pappa says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says: From the day the Temple was destroyed the southern wind has not brought rain, as it is stated</b> in the description of the destruction of the Temple: <b>“He decrees on the right and there is hunger, and consumes on the left and they are not satisfied”</b> (Isaiah 9:19). This means that God decreed that the southern wind, which is called right, shall bring famine with it. <b>And it is written: “North and right, You have created them”</b> (Psalms 89:13). This proves that the term right means south.
<b>And Rafram bar Pappa says</b> that <b>Rav Ḥisda says: From the day the Temple was destroyed, the rains no</b> longer <b>descend from the good storehouse, as it is stated: “The Lord will open to you His good storehouse,</b> the skies, to give the rain of your land in its season” (Deuteronomy 28:12). <b>In a time when the Jewish people perform God’s will, and the Jewish people are settled in their land, rain descends from the good storehouse. In a time when the Jewish people are not settled in their land, rain does not descend from the good storehouse.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: One who wishes to become wise should face south, and</b> one who wishes <b>to become wealthy should face north. And your mnemonic</b> for this is that in the Temple the <b>Table,</b> which symbolized blessing and abundance, <b>was in the north, and the Candelabrum,</b> which symbolized the light of wisdom, <b>was in the south</b> of the Sanctuary. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: One should always face south, as once he becomes wise he will</b> subsequently also <b>become wealthy, as it is stated</b> with regard to the Torah: <b>“Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor”</b> (Proverbs 3:16).
The Gemara asks: <b>But Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says</b> that <b>the Divine Presence is in the west.</b> How, then, can one pray facing south? The Gemara explains <b>that one should turn aside</b> slightly, so that he faces southwest. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said to Rav Ashi:</b> An individual <b>such as you, who lives to the north of Eretz Yisrael, should face south</b> when you pray. <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that Babylonia is located to the north of Eretz Yisrael? As it is written</b> in a prophecy concerning the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians: <b>“Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land”</b> (Jeremiah 1:14).
§ The mishna teaches that <b>one must distance from vegetables the water in which flax is steeped,</b> and distance mustard from bees. A Sage <b>taught</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei permits</b> one not to do so in the case <b>of mustard because he can say to</b> the beekeeper: <b>Before you tell me: Distance your mustard from my bees,</b> I can tell you: <b>Distance your bees from my mustard, as they come and eat my mustard plants.</b> In other words, you are also causing damage to my property. Since they each cause damage to the other, neither can force his neighbor to move.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One must distance a tree twenty-five cubits from a cistern, and</b> in the case <b>of a carob and of a sycamore tree,</b> whose roots extend farther, one must distance the tree <b>fifty cubits.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>whether</b> the cistern or tree <b>is</b> located <b>above or to the side</b> of the other. <b>If</b> the digging of <b>the cistern preceded</b> the tree, the owner of the tree <b>cuts down</b> the tree <b>and</b> the owner of the cistern <b>pays</b> him <b>money. And if the tree preceded</b> the cistern the owner of the tree need <b>not cut down</b> the tree. If it is <b>uncertain whether this came first or that came first,</b> the owner of the tree need <b>not cut down</b> the tree. <b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even if the cistern preceded the tree,</b> the owner of the tree need <b>not cut down</b> the tree. This is due to the fact <b>that this one digs in his own</b> property, <b>and that one plants in his own</b> property.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara discusses the mishna’s statement that a tree must be distanced if it is above a cistern. A Sage <b>taught:</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>whether the cistern is below and the tree is above,</b> or <b>whether the cistern is above and the tree is below.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> if the <b>cistern is below and the tree is above,</b> it will cause damage, as <b>the roots extend and damage the cistern</b> when they breach its walls. <b>But</b> if <b>the cistern is above and the tree is below, why</b> should he have to distance the tree, considering that the roots extend downward? <b>Rabbi Ḥagga says in the name of Rabbi Yosei:</b> He must distance the tree <b>because</b> its roots <b>form holes in the ground and ruin the floor of the cistern.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yosei says: Even if the cistern preceded the tree,</b> the owner of the tree need <b>not cut down</b> the tree. This is due to the fact <b>that this one digs in his own</b> property, <b>and that one plants in his own</b> property. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. Rav Ashi said: When we were</b> studying <b>in the study hall of Rav Kahana, we would say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei concedes with regard to one’s arrows,</b> i.e., one must distance his activities from his neighbor if his actions will cause immediate damage to his neighbor, even if he is acting on his own property.
The Gemara relates that a man called <b>Pappei Yona’a was poor and became wealthy.</b> He <b>built a mansion [<i>appadna</i>]</b> on his land. <b>There were these</b> sesame seed <b>pressers in his neighborhood who</b> would work, and <b>when they would press the sesame seeds</b> their activity <b>would shake his mansion. He came before Rav Ashi</b> to complain. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: When we were</b> studying <b>in the study hall of Rav Kahana, we would say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei concedes with regard to one’s arrows.</b> Here too, because the sesame seed pressers cause immediate damage they must distance themselves.
The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> must the mansion shake for the owner to have the right to compel the sesame seed pressers to distance themselves?

Daf 26a

It must shake enough <b>that the lid [<i>nakhtema</i>]</b> positioned <b>at the mouth of a jug shakes</b> if it is placed on a wall.
The Gemara relates: <b>When the</b> members of the <b>household of bar Maryon, son of Ravin, would beat</b> their <b>flax, the chaff [<i>rakta</i>] would fly off and harm people.</b> Those people <b>came before Ravina</b> to complain. Ravina <b>said to them: When we say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yosei concedes with regard to his arrows, this statement</b> applies only <b>when</b> the damaging item <b>moves by his direct force. Here,</b> by contrast, <b>it is the wind that carries</b> the chaff.
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi objects to this:</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> one who <b>winnows</b> on Shabbat by throwing the grain into the wind so that the chaff is blown away <b>and the wind assists him?</b> That is considered a primary category of labor on Shabbat despite the fact that the act is performed partly with the aid of the wind. The Gemara relates that the Sages <b>stated</b> this objection with regard to beating flax <b>before Mareimar.</b> Mareimar <b>said to them: This</b> case <b>is</b> the same as <b>one who winnows and the wind assists him.</b> Just as this is considered his direct force for the purposes of the <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, it is likewise considered his direct force with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of damages.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Ravina,</b> who rejects this comparison and claims that flying chaff is not considered one’s arrow, in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this situation <b>different from</b> that of <b>a spark that flies from a hammer and causes damage,</b> in which case all agree <b>that</b> the one wielding the hammer <b>is liable to pay?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> it is <b>preferable for him that</b> the spark <b>go</b> as far as possible, rather than staying nearby. <b>Here</b> it is <b>not preferable for him,</b> i.e., it is immaterial to him, <b>that</b> the chaff <b>go</b> some distance.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person may not plant a tree near the field of another unless he distances it four cubits from</b> the field. This is the case <b>whether</b> he is planting <b>grapevines or any</b> kind of <b>tree.</b> If there <b>was a fence between</b> them, <b>this</b> one <b>may place,</b> i.e., plant, his grapevines or trees <b>close to the fence from here, and that</b> one <b>may place,</b> i.e., plant, his produce <b>close to the fence from there.</b>
If the <b>roots were spreading into</b> the field <b>of another,</b> the owner of the field <b>may dig to a depth</b> of <b>three handbreadths</b> even if he severs those roots, <b>so that</b> they do <b>not impede</b> his <b>plow.</b> If he <b>was digging a cistern</b> in that spot, or <b>a ditch, or a cave,</b> and he came upon the roots of his neighbor’s tree, <b>he may cut downward</b> normally, <b>and the wood</b> from the roots <b>is his.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught:</b> The <b>four cubits that</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> one must leave between a vineyard and a neighbor’s field are <b>for the work of the vineyard,</b> so that the owner of the vineyard does not take oxen and a plow into his neighbor’s field while working his vineyard. <b>Shmuel says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only with regard to Eretz Yisrael, but in Babylonia two cubits</b> are sufficient, as their plows are shorter. <b>This</b> opinion <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not plant a tree near the field of another unless he distances</b> the tree <b>two cubits from</b> the field. <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna: <b>Four cubits? Rather, is it not</b> correct that there is a difference between Eretz Yisrael and Babylonia in this regard, <b>as</b> stated <b>by Shmuel?</b> The Gemara concludes: Indeed, <b>learn from it</b> that it is so.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who raise</b> this matter in the form <b>of a contradiction. We learned</b> in the mishna that <b>a person may not plant a tree near the field of another unless he distances it four cubits from</b> the field. <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>two cubits</b> are sufficient? <b>Shmuel said</b> that this is <b>not difficult: Here</b> it is referring <b>to Babylonia,</b> whereas <b>there</b> it is referring <b>to Eretz Yisrael.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rava bar Rav Ḥanan had these palm trees</b> that stood <b>adjacent to the boundary of Rav Yosef’s vineyard. Birds would come and roost on the palm trees and</b> would subsequently <b>descend to the vineyard and damage it.</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to</b> Rava bar Rav Ḥanan: <b>Go</b> and <b>cut down</b> your palm trees. Rava bar Rav Ḥanan <b>said to him: But I distanced</b> them the required amount. Rav Yosef <b>said to him: This matter,</b> i.e., this specific distance, applies only <b>to trees, but a greater</b> distance <b>is required for vines.</b>
Rava bar Rav Ḥanan protested: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>whether</b> he is planting <b>grapevines or any</b> kind of <b>tree?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: This matter</b> applies only to the distance between one <b>tree and</b> another <b>tree, or</b> the distance between one <b>vine and</b> other <b>vines. But</b> with regard to the space between <b>a tree and vines, one requires a greater distance.</b>
Rava bar Rav Ḥanan <b>said to him: I</b> myself <b>will not cut them down, as Rav said:</b> With regard to <b>this palm tree that produces one <i>kav</i></b> of fruit, it is <b>prohibited to cut it down,</b> due to the verse: “You shall not destroy the trees” (Deuteronomy 20:19). <b>And Rabbi Ḥanina says: My son Shikhḥat died only because he cut down a fig tree before its time.</b> Rava bar Rav Ḥanan continued: <b>If the Master is amenable</b> to do so, he <b>may cut</b> them down, but I will not do it.
The Gemara further relates that <b>Rav Pappa had these palm trees</b> that stood <b>adjacent to the boundary of</b> the property of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua. He went</b> and <b>found</b> Rav Huna <b>digging and cutting his roots.</b> Rav Pappa <b>said to him: What is this?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him</b> that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna: If the <b>roots were spreading into</b> the field <b>of another,</b> the owner of the field <b>may dig to a depth</b> of <b>three handbreadths</b> even if he severs those roots, <b>so that</b> they do <b>not impede</b> his <b>plow.</b>
Rav Pappa <b>said to him: This statement</b> applies only up to <b>three</b> handbreadths, whereas the <b>Master is digging</b> and cutting <b>more</b> than three. Rav Huna <b>said to him: I am</b> digging <b>cisterns, ditches, and caves, as we learned</b> in the mishna: If he <b>was digging a cistern, a ditch, or a cave, he may cut downward</b> normally <b>and the wood</b> from the roots <b>is his. Rav Pappa said: I told him all</b> the proofs I could find, <b>but I was unable to</b> convince <b>him</b> that I was correct,

Daf 26b

<b>until I told him that</b> which <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>a strip</b> of land over <b>which the public has an acquired privilege</b> of use, one <b>may not destroy it.</b> Here too, since I have an acquired privilege of use of this land, you are not permitted to destroy that which I possess. <b>After</b> Rav Pappa <b>left,</b> Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, <b>said: Why did I not say to him</b> that <b>there,</b> an acquired privilege of use is effective when it is <b>within sixteen cubits,</b> as within that area the roots are considered part of the tree, whereas <b>here</b> I cut the roots of the palm trees <b>beyond sixteen cubits.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that if <b>he was digging a cistern, a ditch, or a cave, he may cut downward and the wood is his.</b> The Sage <b>Ya’akov of Hadeyyav raised a dilemma before Rav Ḥisda: To whom does the wood belong?</b> The mishna says that the wood is his, without specifying to which of the two individuals this refers, the owner of the tree or the owner of the land.
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: You learned</b> the answer in a mishna in tractate <i>Me’ila</i> (13b). If <b>roots of a tree</b> belonging <b>to an ordinary person [<i>hedyot</i>] extend into</b> a field belonging <b>to the Temple</b> treasury, <b>one may not derive benefit</b> from them, but if one derived benefit from them he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. That is, even if one does transgress the prohibition and benefit from them, it is not considered misuse and he is not liable to bring an offering.
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>we follow the tree,</b> and the roots are considered part of it, it is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>one is not</b> liable for <b>misuse,</b> as the tree is not consecrated. <b>But if you say we follow the land,</b> i.e., the roots belong to the land’s owner, <b>why</b> is he <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property?
The Gemara asks: <b>Rather, what</b> will you say, that <b>we follow the tree?</b> If so, <b>say the last clause</b> of that mishna: If roots of a tree belonging <b>to the Temple</b> treasury <b>extend into</b> a field <b>of an ordinary person, one may not derive benefit</b> from them, but if one derived benefit from them he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. <b>But if we follow the tree, why</b> is he <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property?
The Gemara responds: <b>Are the cases comparable?</b> In both clauses of the mishna <b>we are dealing with growths that came thereafter,</b> i.e., after the tree was consecrated, <b>and</b> the <i>tanna</i> of that mishna <b>holds</b> that <b>with regard to growths</b> that grew from a consecrated plant or tree, they are <b>not</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. Only the original plant is. Consequently, there is no connection between that mishna and the question of whether roots are considered part of the tree or part of the land.
<b>Ravina said</b> that it is <b>not difficult: Here,</b> in the first clause of the mishna in <i>Me’ila</i>, it is referring to <b>within sixteen cubits</b> of the tree. In this case the roots are considered part of the tree. <b>There,</b> in the second clause, it is referring to roots <b>beyond sixteen cubits,</b> in which case the roots are considered part of the ground where they are found.
<b>Ulla said:</b> An individual who maintains <b>a tree that is within sixteen cubits of a boundary is a robber,</b> as it draws nourishment from the neighbor’s land, <b>and one does not bring first fruits from it,</b> since that would be a mitzva that is fulfilled by means of a transgression.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where does Ulla</b> derive <b>that</b> measurement? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>from</b> that <b>which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 1:6), this is problematic. That mishna teaches: If there were <b>ten saplings scattered in a <i>beit se’a</i>, one may plow the entire <i>beit se’a</i> for their</b> sake <b>until Rosh HaShana</b> of the Sabbatical Year. Although it is prohibited to plow other land in the time leading into the Sabbatical Year, to avoid the appearance of preparing to work the ground in that year, it is permitted to do so for the purpose of sustaining these young trees.
The Gemara calculates: <b>How much is</b> the area of a <i>beit se’a</i>? It is <b>2,500</b> square <b>cubits. And how much</b> area is allocated <b>for each and every one</b> of the ten trees? It is <b>250</b> square cubits. <b>This is not</b> the distance <b>that Ulla</b> taught. An area of sixteen cubits to each side of the tree is a square of thirty-two by thirty-two cubits, or 1,024 square cubits, which is much larger than 250.
<b>But rather,</b> Ulla derived this measurement <b>from</b> that <b>which we learned</b> in the following mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 1:5): If there were <b>three</b> large <b>trees</b> belonging <b>to three</b> different <b>people</b> in one <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>these</b> trees <b>combine, and one may plow the entire</b>

Daf 27a

<b><i>beit se’a</i> for their</b> sake. <b>How much</b> is that area in cubits? It is <b>2,500</b> square <b>cubits. And how much</b> area is that <b>for each</b> of the trees? It is <b>833⅓. Still, Ulla's</b> amount <b>is greater</b> than this. The Gemara answers: Ulla <b>was not precise</b> in this matter.
The Gemara asks: One can <b>say that we say</b> that a Sage <b>was not precise</b> in his measurements when his ruling leads <b>to a stringency;</b> but <b>do we say</b> that he <b>was not precise</b> if his measurements lead <b>to a leniency?</b> According to the previous explanation, Ulla exempts the owner of a tree from first fruits even in a case where his tree does not in fact draw nourishment from his neighbor’s field.
The Gemara answers: <b>Do you maintain</b> that <b>we say</b> the roots extend that far <b>in a square,</b> i.e., one measures sixteen cubits to each side of the tree? Not so; <b>we say</b> this <b>with regard to a circle,</b> that is, the roots extend in a circle surrounding the tree, as the area of a circle is smaller than that of the square circumscribing it.
The Gemara asks: <b>Now,</b> by <b>how much is</b> the area of <b>a square greater than the</b> area of a <b>circle</b> with a diameter the length of the side of that square? It is greater by <b>one-quarter</b> of the area of the circle. If so, <b>768</b> square cubits, three-quarters of 1,024, <b>remain</b> for each tree, but <b>there still remains half a cubit</b> more based on the mishna’s calculation. In other words, the measurement would be more accurate if a tree is considered to draw nourishment from a distance of sixteen and a half cubits on each side. The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> why we said that Ulla <b>was not precise, and</b> he was <b>not precise</b> in a manner that leads <b>to a stringency,</b> as one brings first fruits even from a tree that stands just sixteen cubits from the boundary, rather than 16½.
The Gemara cites a proof against the opinion of Ulla. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> the following mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:11): <b>One who buys a tree and its land brings</b> first fruits <b>and recites</b> the requisite Torah verses (Deuteronomy 26:5–11) over them. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case where one buys <b>any amount</b> of land with the tree? The Gemara rejects this claim: <b>No;</b> it is referring to a case where one buys <b>sixteen cubits</b> of land around the tree.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> an additional proof from another mishna (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:6): If one <b>bought two trees in</b> the field <b>of another, he brings</b> first fruits <b>and does not recite</b> the verses, because the land does not belong to him. It may be inferred from here that if he bought <b>three</b> trees <b>he does bring</b> first fruits <b>and recite</b> the verses. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case where one buys <b>any amount</b> of land with the trees? The Gemara rejects this claim as well: <b>No; here too</b> it is referring to a case where he acquires <b>sixteen cubits</b> of land around the trees.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:6). <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The owner of <b>land of any</b> size <b>is obligated in <i>pe’a</i> and in first fruits, and</b> a lender <b>can write a document that prevents the Sabbatical Year from abrogating an outstanding debt [<i>prosbol</i>] for</b> this land, so that loans he provided will not be canceled at the close of the Sabbatical Year,

Daf 27b

<b>and he can acquire property that does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, along <b>with it.</b> There are specific modes of acquisition for movable property, but if one is acquiring any amount of land at the same time as the movable property, the mode of acquisition employed to acquire the land suffices for the acquisition of the movable property as well. Apparently, any amount of land is subject to first fruits, whereas according to Ulla a tree acquired with less than sixteen cubits of land surrounding it draws nourishment from the land surrounding it and is exempt from first fruits. The Gemara rejects this: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with wheat,</b> which is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of first fruits and requires very little land to nourish it.
The Gemara comments that the language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches:</b> Land <b>of any</b> size, which indicates even a miniscule amount, and all normal trees certainly require more land than that. The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from it</b> that it is so.
The Gemara further suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ma’asrot</i> 2:22): If there is <b>a tree, part of which is in Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>and part of which is outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, it is considered as though <b>untithed produce,</b> i.e., produce that is subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>terumot</i> and tithes, <b>and non-sacred produce,</b> i.e., produce that is exempt from the <i>halakhot</i> of <i>terumot</i> and tithes, <b>are mixed together</b> in each one of this tree’s fruits. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> With regard to the fruits in the part of the tree that is <b>growing in</b> a place where there is <b>an obligation</b> to separate tithes, i.e., in Eretz Yisrael, the owner is <b>obligated</b> to separate tithes. With regard to the fruits that are <b>growing in</b> a place where there is <b>an exemption</b> from separating tithes, i.e., outside of Eretz Yisrael, the owner is <b>exempt.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>They disagree only in that</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds</b> that <b>there is</b> retroactive <b>designation,</b> and therefore it is assumed that the nourishment drawn from Eretz Yisrael sustained the fruit that grew on that side of the tree, and the nourishment drawn from outside Eretz Yisrael sustained the fruit that grew there. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that <b>there is no</b> retroactive <b>designation,</b> and the fruit is considered mixed.
<b>But</b> if the tree <b>grew</b> entirely <b>in</b> a place where there is <b>an exemption</b> from separating tithes, i.e., outside Eretz Yisrael, <b>all agree</b> that the owner is <b>exempt,</b> even though the tree might have roots within sixteen cubits of Eretz Yisrael and draw nourishment from there. This presents a difficulty for the opinion of Ulla, as he claims that the place from where a tree draws its nourishment is decisive with regard to first fruits.
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where a rock divides</b> the roots up to the trunk, and therefore it is possible to distinguish between the parts of the tree that draw nutrients from Eretz Yisrael and the parts that draw nutrients from outside of Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, what is the reasoning of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi? Why does he view the fruits as being a mixture? The Gemara answers: He holds that although there is a division between the roots, they cannot be distinguished from one another, <b>as they then become mixed</b> in the body of the tree.
The Gemara asks: <b>And with regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds: The air</b> above the ground <b>mixes</b> the nutrients, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds: This</b> part of the tree <b>stands alone and this</b> part of the tree <b>stands alone.</b> From the roots up to the branches, it is as if the tree were cut along the line of the border.
The Gemara raises a difficulty against Ulla’s opinion from a different perspective: <b>And</b> do roots extend <b>sixteen cubits and no more? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (25b): <b>One must distance a tree twenty-five cubits from a cistern?</b> This indicates that tree roots reach more than sixteen cubits. <b>Abaye said:</b> The roots <b>extend farther,</b> but <b>they weaken the ground only up to sixteen cubits;</b> with regard to an area any <b>more</b> distant than that, <b>they do not weaken</b> the ground.
Concerning this matter the Gemara relates that <b>when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said: Reish Lakish raised a dilemma before Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> With regard to <b>a tree</b> that is <b>within sixteen cubits of a boundary, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him:</b> The owner <b>is a robber, and one does not bring first fruits from it.</b>
By contrast, <b>when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he related that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Both</b> in the case of <b>a tree that is close to a boundary and a tree that leans</b> into a neighbor’s yard, <b>one brings</b> first fruits <b>and recites</b> the verses, <b>as it was on this condition that Joshua apportioned Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to the Jewish people,</b> i.e., that they would not be particular about such matters.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a tree that leans into the field of another,</b> the neighbor <b>may cut</b> the branches <b>to the height of an ox goad</b> raised <b>over the plow,</b> in places where the land is to be plowed, so that the branches do not impede the use of the plow. <b>And</b> in the case <b>of a carob tree and</b> the case <b>of a sycamore tree,</b> whose abundance of branches cast shade that is harmful to plants, all the branches overhanging one’s property may be removed <b>along the plumb line,</b> i.e., along a line perpendicular to the boundary separating the fields. And if the neighbor’s field is <b>an irrigated field, all</b> branches of <b>the tree</b> are removed <b>along the plumb line. Abba Shaul says: All barren trees</b> are cut <b>along the plumb line.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before them:</b> Is <b>Abba Shaul referring to the first clause</b> of the mishna, which states that a tree extending into a neighbor’s field is cut only to the height of an ox goad, and Abba Shaul maintains that barren trees have the same <i>halakha</i> as carob and sycamore trees in that they are cut along the plumb line? <b>Or</b> is he <b>referring to the latter clause,</b> which discusses an irrigated field, and he permits cutting only barren trees along the plumb line, but not fruit trees?
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution to this dilemma, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>an irrigated field, Abba Shaul says: All</b> types of <b>trees</b> are cut <b>along the plumb line, because the shade is harmful to an irrigated field.</b> This shows that he does not dispute the <i>halakha</i> of the latter clause. <b>Learn from it</b> that <b>he is referring to the first clause</b> of the mishna. The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from it</b> that it is so.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that the wording of <b>the mishna is also precise, as it teaches: All barren trees. Granted, if you say</b> that Abba Shaul <b>is referring to the first clause</b> of the mishna, <b>this</b> is the reason <b>that</b> Abba Shaul <b>teaches: All</b> barren <b>trees. But if you say</b> that <b>he is referring to the latter clause, he should have</b> said simply: <b>Barren trees,</b> as the first <i>tanna</i> permits one to cut down any type of tree. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from it</b> that he is <b>referring to the first clause?</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from it</b> that it is so.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a tree that extends into the public domain, one cuts</b> its branches <b>so that a camel can pass</b> beneath the tree <b>with its rider</b> sitting on it. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One cuts enough branches that <b>a camel loaded with flax or bundles of branches</b> can pass beneath it. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> One cuts <b>all</b> branches of <b>the tree that</b> extend into the public domain <b>along the plumb line,</b> so that they do not hang over the public area at all, <b>due to ritual impurity.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught</b> that <b>with regard to damage</b> one <b>follows the current assessment,</b> and future damage is not taken into account? The mishna states that the tree’s branches are cut to the height of a camel and its rider or load but no more, despite the fact that they will certainly grow again.
<b>Reish Lakish says:</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>is taught as a dispute, and it is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer. As we learned</b> in a mishna (60a): One <b>may not make</b> an empty <b>space beneath the public domain</b> by digging <b>pits, ditches, or caves. Rabbi Eliezer permits</b> one to dig a pit if it is subsequently covered with material strong <b>enough that a wagon loaded with stones can travel on it</b> without it collapsing. If the cover can withstand such weight when the pit is dug, it is permitted, despite the fact that the cover might eventually rot.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna here represents the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who prohibit one from digging beneath the public domain under any circumstances. The difference is that <b>there,</b> the cover <b>will occasionally deteriorate, and</b> as this matter is <b>not on his mind</b> it will cause damage. <b>But here,</b> as <b>each</b> branch grows <b>he cuts it off.</b> Since the potential cause of damage is visible, there is no concern that it might be neglected.
§ The mishna teaches that if the branches of a tree extend into the public domain, one may cut them to allow a camel and its rider to pass underneath; <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> One cuts enough branches that <b>a camel loaded with flax or bundles of branches</b> can pass beneath it. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is <b>Rabbi Yehuda’s measure greater, or</b> is <b>perhaps the Rabbis’ measure greater?</b> Which reaches a greater height, a camel and rider or a camel loaded with flax?
The Gemara answers: It is <b>obvious that the Rabbis’ measure</b> is <b>greater, as, if it enters your mind</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda’s measure</b> is <b>greater, how would the Rabbis act in</b> the circumstance of <b>Rabbi Yehuda’s measure?</b> It is clear that a camel will have to pass beneath the tree with a burden, and it would not be able to do so. The Gemara expresses surprise at this claim: <b>Rather, what</b> then would you say? That <b>the Rabbis’ measure</b> is <b>greater?</b> If so, <b>how would Rabbi Yehuda act in</b> the circumstance of <b>the Rabbis’ measure?</b> It is also clear that a camel will have to pass there with its rider. The Gemara answers: <b>It is possible for</b> the rider <b>to bend over and to pass underneath</b> the branches.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> One cuts <b>all</b> branches of <b>the tree</b> that extend into the public domain <b>along the plumb line, due to ritual impurity.</b> The Gemara explains: A <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that this is <b>due to ritual impurity</b> imparted in <b>a tent.</b> Branches over a corpse might create a tent, thereby transferring impurity to whatever is beneath the branches, rendering impure those passing under the tree in the public domain. The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: It is <b>obvious</b> that this is the reason. <b>We</b> already <b>learned</b> that it is <b>due to ritual impurity.</b> How else could ritual impurity be transferred through branches other than by means of a tent?
The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> this is learned <b>from the mishna</b> alone, <b>I would say</b> that the concern is that <b>perhaps a crow might bring</b> a source of <b>impurity</b> and perch on the tree’s branches <b>and throw it there. And</b> if that were the only concern, <b>a mere scarecrow [<i>bedaḥlulei</i>] would be sufficient</b> to frighten the crows away and prevent that type of impurity. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that the concern is due to impurity imparted in a tent.

Daf 28a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to the <b>presumptive ownership of houses; and</b> of <b>pits; and</b> of <b>ditches; and</b> of <b>caves,</b> which are used to collect water; <b>and</b> of <b>dovecotes; and</b> of <b>bathhouses; and</b> of <b>olive presses; and</b> of <b>irrigated fields,</b> which must be watered by people; <b>and</b> of <b>slaves; and all</b> similar property <b>that constantly,</b> i.e., throughout the year, <b>generates profits, their presumptive ownership</b> is established by working and profiting from them for a duration of <b>three years from day to day.</b> If the one in possession of the property can prove that he worked and profited from it for the previous three full years, there is a presumption that it belongs to him, and would remain in his possession if another were to claim that the property belonged to him or to his ancestors.
With regard to <b>a non-irrigated field,</b> i.e., one that is watered by rain, in which produce grows during certain seasons during the year, <b>its presumption</b> of ownership is established in <b>three years, but they are not from day to day,</b> since the fields are not worked and harvested continually throughout the three-year period.
<b>Rabbi Yishmael says: Three months</b> of possession <b>in the first</b> year, <b>three</b> months of possession <b>in the last</b> year, <b>and twelve months</b> of possession <b>in the middle, which are eighteen months,</b> suffice to establish the presumption of ownership with regard to a non-irrigated field.
<b>Rabbi Akiva says: A month</b> of possession <b>in the first</b> year, <b>and a month</b> of possession <b>in the last year, and twelve months</b> of possession <b>in the middle, which are fourteen months,</b> suffice to establish the presumption of ownership with regard to a non-irrigated field.
<b>Rabbi Yishmael said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that eighteen months are required for a non-irrigated field, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to a white field [<i>bisdeh lavan</i>],</b> i.e., a grain field. <b>But with regard to a field of trees,</b> once <b>he gathered his produce, and</b> then <b>harvested his olives,</b> and then <b>gathered his figs, these</b> three harvests <b>are</b> the equivalent of <b>three years.</b> Since he harvested three types of produce, this is equivalent to having possessed the field for three years.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: I heard from those who travel to Usha</b> to study with the Sages there <b>that they would say: From where</b> is it derived <b>that presumptive ownership</b> is established in <b>three years? From the forewarned ox: Just as</b> in the case of <b>a forewarned ox, once it has</b> intentionally <b>gored three gorings, it left</b> the <b>presumptive status of an innocuous</b> ox <b>and it is established as</b> having the <b>presumptive status of a forewarned</b> ox, <b>here too, once he has</b> worked and <b>profited</b> from the land for <b>three years,</b> the land <b>left the possession of</b> the <b>seller, and it is established</b> as being <b>in the possession of</b> the <b>buyer.</b>
The Gemara questions this comparison: <b>If</b> so, say that <b>just as with a forewarned ox,</b> the owner <b>is not liable</b> to pay full damages <b>until the fourth goring, here too,</b> the land should <b>not be established</b> as being <b>in his possession until the fourth year.</b> The Gemara rejects this question: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There, once it has gored three</b> times <b>it is forewarned,</b>

Daf 28b

<b>and</b> the requirement for there to be <b>another,</b> fourth, incident for the owner to be liable to pay full damages exists because <b>before it gores</b> after having become a forewarned ox, <b>what</b> is there for the owner <b>to pay? Here, once he has</b> worked and <b>profited</b> from the land for <b>three years,</b> the land <b>is established</b> as being <b>in his possession.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> according to the explanation that the forewarned ox is the source for the presumption of ownership with regard to land, even <b>possession that is not accompanied by a claim,</b> i.e., where the possessor has no explanation as to how he acquired it, <b>should be</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, just as goring three times automatically establishes its having the status of a forewarned ox. <b>Why did we learn</b> in a mishna (41a): <b>Any possession that is not accompanied by a claim</b> explaining how the possessor became the owner <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership?
The Gemara answers: <b>What is the reason</b> that possession that is not accompanied by a claim is not sufficient to establish the presumption of ownership? <b>Because</b> in a standard case where one has presumptive ownership, <b>we say</b> that even if the claimant proves that the field was once his, since the other is in possession of the land, <b>perhaps</b> the truth is <b>as he says,</b> that he purchased it from the previous owner. But <b>now</b> that <b>he</b> himself <b>does not claim</b> that he purchased it, <b>will we claim</b> this <b>for him?</b>
<b>Rav Avira objects to</b> the explanation that the presumption with regard to land is derived from the <i>halakha</i> of a forewarned ox: <b>If that is so, a protest that</b> the claimant lodges during the three years <b>not in the presence</b> of the possessor <b>should not be</b> considered <b>a protest,</b> because it must be <b>similar</b> to the <i>halakha</i> <b>of a forewarned ox: Just as we require</b> that the testimony concerning <b>a forewarned ox</b> be <b>in</b> its owner’s <b>presence, so too here, we</b> should <b>also require</b> that a protest be lodged <b>in the</b> possessor’s <b>presence.</b>
The Gemara answers: This is not difficult. <b>There,</b> with regard to a forewarned ox, <b>it is written: “And warning has been given to its owner”</b> (Exodus 21:29), indicating that the warning must be issued in the presence of the owner. <b>Here,</b> with regard to the protest, <b>your friend has a friend, and the friend of your friend has a friend,</b> so that the protest will become known even if lodged not in the presence of the possessor, as word of it will spread. There is no Torah edict mandating that the protest be lodged in his presence, and it is sufficient that he hears of it, even secondhand.
The Gemara further asks: <b>And</b> according <b>to Rabbi Meir, who says:</b> When the ox <b>performs its gorings at intervals</b> its owner is <b>liable,</b> if it <b>performs its gorings successively,</b> is it <b>not all the more so</b> the case that its owner is liable? According to his opinion, the animal must gore only three times to become forewarned, and it is not required that the gorings occur on three separate days; they can all occur on the same day. Similarly, one could say that if <b>he profited</b> from the field by consuming <b>three fruits</b> of, <b>for example, a fig</b> tree, <b>within one day, that should be</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.
The Gemara answers: This would not be a valid comparison, as presumptive ownership with regard to land must be <b>similar</b> to the <i>halakha</i> <b>of a forewarned ox: Just as</b> with <b>a forewarned ox, at the time when</b> the animal <b>has this goring, it does not have that goring,</b> as each act of goring occurs at a separate time, <b>here too,</b> in order for the consumption of the produce to establish the presumption of ownership, it must be that <b>at the time when this fruit is here, that fruit is not here.</b> When all the produce of the field is extant concurrently, consumption of this produce does not establish the presumption of ownership, even if the produce is consumed at three different times.
The Gemara asks: Based on this, if <b>he profited</b> from the field by consuming <b>three fruits within three</b> consecutive <b>days, for example,</b> the fruits of <b>a caper bush,</b> whose fruits ripen day after day, <b>that should be</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, as all three fruits were not ripe concurrently. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to the caper bush, <b>at least the fruit is here and it is in the process of finishing</b> its ripening during the three days. This is not similar to the goring ox, where each goring is fully independent of the others.
The Gemara challenges: Based on this, if <b>he profited</b> from the field by consuming <b>three fruits within thirty days, for example, alfalfa [<i>aspasta</i>],</b> which quickly regrows when cut, and which is repeatedly cut over a short period of time, <b>that should be</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. The Gemara explains: <b>What are the circumstances</b> where it could regrow three times within thirty days? <b>Where it grows a little</b> and he cuts <b>and consumes it, where it grows a little</b> more <b>and he consumes it,</b> such that he cuts it three times within thirty days. <b>There, he is seizing and consuming</b> the alfalfa, which is not the normal way of farming it, and consequently he does not establish the presumption of ownership, which is established only through standard use of the land.
The Gemara challenges: Based on this, if <b>he profited</b> from the field by consuming <b>three fruits within three months, for example, alfalfa,</b> where he did employ the standard method of harvesting it, <b>that should be</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. The Gemara explains: <b>Who are</b> they <b>who travel to Usha</b> whose opinion is under discussion? It is <b>Rabbi Yishmael. Indeed,</b> according <b>to Rabbi Yishmael,</b> this would establish the presumption of ownership.
This is <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that eighteen months are required for a non-irrigated field, <b>said? With regard to a white field,</b> i.e., a grain field. <b>But with regard to a field of trees,</b> once <b>he gathered his produce, and</b> then <b>harvested his olives, and</b> then <b>gathered his figs, these</b> three harvests <b>are</b> the equivalent of <b>three years.</b> Rabbi Yishmael is of the opinion that three harvests are sufficient.
The Gemara asks: <b>According to the Rabbis,</b> who hold that three years, and not three harvests, are required to establish the presumption of ownership, <b>what</b> is the source for the concept of this type of presumptive ownership?
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> that <b>it is written</b> in the <b>verse</b> detailing the purchase of a field from Hanamel by Jeremiah, his cousin, during the time of the siege of Eretz Yisrael: <b>“Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44). This describes the writing of a bill of sale to serve as proof of ownership of the field, since he was unable to remain living there for three years to establish the presumption of ownership. <b>As the prophet</b> Jeremiah <b>stood in the tenth</b> year of King Zedekiah’s reign <b>and warned</b> people to write bills of sale <b>for the eleventh</b> year, when Eretz Yisrael would be overrun. Consequently, despite the fact that one purchasing a field there would be able to live on the land for two years, this would not be sufficient to establish the presumption of ownership, which is why he said that they should have bills of sale written.
<b>Abaye said to him: Perhaps there he</b> merely <b>teaches us good advice,</b> that it is advisable to have documents to preclude the need to present witnesses that can attest that one had been living on the land. This is not a proof that the presumption of ownership cannot be established in less than three years.

Daf 29a

<b>Because if you do not say so,</b> then when he states: <b>“Build houses, and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them”</b> (Jeremiah 29:5), <b>what</b> halakhic statement <b>was he saying? Rather, he teaches us good advice,</b> and <b>here too he teaches us good advice.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Know</b> that this was mere advice, <b>as it is written: “And put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days”</b> (Jeremiah 32:14). This is obviously good advice to preserve the items properly, and is not a halakhic statement. Therefore, this is not a proof that the presumption of ownership cannot be established in under three years.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different reason: <b>A person</b> who sees another profiting from his field might <b>waive</b> his rights during <b>the first year,</b> and he might <b>waive</b> his rights for <b>two</b> years, but <b>he will not waive</b> his rights for <b>three</b> years. Therefore, if one does not lodge a protest by the end of the third year, it is tantamount to a concession that the land is not his.
<b>Abaye said to him: If that is so, when</b> it becomes clear that <b>the land</b> is in fact owned by another and it <b>is returned</b> to its owner, <b>it should be returned, save for the produce</b> that the possessor consumed during the first two years, as the owner waived his rights to it. <b>Why did Rav Naḥman say: The land is returned and the produce is returned?</b>
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different reason: <b>A person is not particular the first year</b> to lodge a protest, and he <b>is not particular</b> for <b>two</b> years, even though he does not waive his rights to the pro-duce. He <b>is particular</b> to lodge a protest when he sees another profiting from his field for <b>three</b> years. Therefore, if one does not lodge a protest by the end of the third year, it is tantamount to a concession that the land is not his.
<b>Abaye said to him: If that is so,</b> for people <b>such as those of the bar Elyashiv household, who are particular even with regard to one who goes on the boundary of their</b> field, <b>here too,</b> will you say <b>that presumptive ownership is</b> established <b>immediately,</b> as soon as one makes use of their property without their lodging a protest? <b>And if you would say</b> that is <b>indeed</b> the <i>halakha</i>, <b>if so, you have subjected your statement to the</b> varying <b>circumstances</b> of each case, as there will be a different length of time needed to establish the presumption of ownership depending on who the prior owner is. This is untenable.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different reason: <b>A person is careful with his document</b> detailing his purchase of land for <b>the first year</b> after the purchase, and he <b>is</b> also <b>careful</b> for <b>two and three</b> years. For <b>more</b> time than that, <b>he is not careful</b> and might discard the document if no one has lodged a protest concerning his possession of the land. Therefore, the Sages ruled that after three years have passed, he can prove his ownership by means of presumptive ownership.
<b>Abaye said to him: If that is so, a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence should not be</b> a valid <b>protest,</b> and if three years pass with no protest in his presence, presumptive ownership should be established even if there was a protest lodged before other people. This is <b>because</b> the one possessing the land can <b>say to</b> the claimant: <b>If you had protested in my presence, I would have been careful with my document</b> and would not have discarded it.
The Gemara explains that this claim would not be accepted, <b>be-cause</b> the claimant can <b>say to him: Your friend has a friend, and your friend’s friend has a friend,</b> and the assumption is that word of the protest reached you.
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The <b>three years that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> are required to establish the presumption of ownership <b>is</b> referring to <b>when he</b> worked and <b>profited</b> from the field in <b>consecutive</b> years. The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Huna <b>teaching us</b> with this statement? <b>We learned</b> this in the mishna: <b>Their presumption</b> of ownership is established by use for a duration of <b>three years from day to day.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that the phrase: <b>From day to day,</b> serves <b>to exclude partial</b> years and to teach that each of the three years must be full, <b>and actually even scattered,</b> i.e., non-consecutive, years are sufficient, therefore, Rav Huna <b>teaches us</b> that the years must be consecutive.
<b>Rav Ḥama says: And Rav Huna concedes with regard to locations where</b> they leave <b>fields [<i>bagei</i>]</b> to <b>lie fallow</b> by planting in alternate years, that the three years combine despite not being consecutive, as that is the manner in which owners profit from the land.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this with regard to locations <b>where there are</b> some people <b>who leave</b> the fields to <b>lie fallow and there are</b> some people <b>who do not leave</b> the fields to <b>lie fallow, and this man left</b> the field to <b>lie fallow. Lest you say</b> that the claimant can <b>say to him: If it is so that</b> the land <b>is yours, you should have sown it,</b> therefore, Rav Ḥama <b>teaches us that</b> the possessor <b>can say to</b> the claimant: <b>I am not able to</b> hire someone to <b>guard one</b> parcel of <b>land within an entire field,</b> and I acted like those who own other land in this location and let the field lie fallow.
<b>And alternatively,</b> the possessor can say to the claimant: <b>In this</b> manner of farming it is <b>beneficial for me</b> to farm, <b>because</b> the land <b>produces more</b> later, and I do not wish to plant year after year and weaken the soil.
The Gemara clarifies Rav Huna’s statement that the presumption of ownership can be established only by consecutive use. <b>We learned</b> in the mishna about the <b>presumptive ownership of houses. But</b> with regard to the use of <b>houses, where</b> the witnesses attesting to its use <b>know</b> who uses the house only <b>in the day,</b> but <b>they do not know</b> who uses the house <b>in the night,</b> how then can one establish the presumption of ownership in the case of a house? The possessor’s use is not consecutive, as it is continually interrupted by the nights.
<b>Abaye said: Who testifies about houses? Neighbors,</b> and <b>neighbors know</b> who is inside <b>in the day and in the night.</b>
<b>Rava said</b> that there is another scenario in which one can bring witnesses with regard to the use of a house. This is <b>such as when two</b> people <b>come and say: We rented</b> the house <b>from him and we lived in it for three years, in the day and in the night.</b> This testimony substantiates that the house was used under the authority of the one who is attempting to prove that he has established the presumption of ownership.
<b>Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi:</b> How can their testimony be relied upon? <b>These</b> witnesses <b>are biased in their testimony, because if they do not say this</b> testimony, that they rented the house from the possessor for three consecutive years, <b>we say to them: Go</b> and <b>give payment for</b> the rental of <b>the house to that</b> one who is claiming ownership, as the one you paid has not established that he is the true owner.
Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Low</b>-level <b>judges rule this way.</b> In other words, only a court composed of ignorant judges would accept the testimony of the renters of the house in a case where they are biased in their testimony. Nevertheless, Rava’s scenario is still possible, as, <b>are we not dealing with</b> a case <b>where they are holding</b> the money for the <b>payment for</b> the rental of <b>the house, and they are saying</b> to the court: <b>To whom shall we give it?</b> Therefore, they are not biased in their testimony, because they will pay the same amount, regardless of who the actual owner is.
The Gemara quotes a related statement. <b>Mar Zutra said: And if</b> the claimant <b>claims and says: Let two witnesses come to testify for</b> the possessor <b>that he lived in</b> the house <b>three years in the day and in the night, his claim is</b> a legitimate <b>claim.</b>

Daf 29b

<b>And Mar Zutra concedes with regard to peddlers who travel through cities,</b> during which time others might live in their houses, <b>that even though</b> the claimant <b>does not claim</b> that he insists on testimony that there was continuous use, day and night, over three years, <b>we</b> the court <b>claim</b> this <b>for him.</b> Since people know they are traveling salesmen, it is more likely that people lived in their houses without permission and without their knowledge.
With regard to the requirement for continuous day and night use to establish the presumption of ownership, the Gemara comments: <b>And Rav Huna concedes with regard to a store</b> in the town <b>of Meḥoza, which</b> is generally <b>used in the day</b> and <b>is not</b> generally <b>used in the night,</b> that one is not required to use it in the night to establish the presumption of ownership.
With regard to the requirement of continuous use to establish the presumption of ownership, the Gemara relates that <b>Rami bar Ḥama and Rav Ukva bar Ḥama purchased a maidservant together.</b> One <b>Sage made use of her</b> during the <b>first, third, and fifth</b> years, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage made use of her</b> during the <b>second, fourth, and sixth</b> years. <b>One</b> individual <b>who contested</b> their ownership <b>of</b> the maidservant <b>emerged</b> and claimed that he was the owner.
<b>They came before Rava</b> for a judgment. <b>He said to them: What is the reason you acted like this,</b> making use of her in alternate years, <b>so that</b> each of <b>you would not establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>concerning each other</b> by making use of her for three consecutive years? <b>Just as</b> this usage does <b>not</b> establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to you,</b> it does <b>not</b> establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to others,</b> i.e., the claimant in this case, <b>as well.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>And we said</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> it <b>was not written</b> in a <b>document</b> that they are partners and are dividing the use, <b>but</b> if it <b>was written</b> in a <b>document,</b> the document generates <b>publicity</b> that they own the maidservant as partners rather than individually, and they can jointly establish the presumption of ownership.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the requirement for full use of land to establish the presumption of ownership. <b>Rava says:</b> If one worked and <b>profited,</b> for three years, <b>from all of</b> the land <b>except for</b> the <b>area required for sowing a quarter-<i>kav</i> of seed [<i>beit rova</i>],</b> which he did not use, <b>he acquires all</b> of the field based on presumptive ownership <b>except for</b> that <b><i>beit rova</i>.</b>
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says: And we said</b> this ruling <b>only where</b> that <i>beit rova</i> <b>is suitable for planting, but</b> if <b>it is not suitable for planting, he acquires it by means of</b> the acquisition of the rest of the <b>land.</b>
<b>Rav Beivai bar Abaye objects to this: If that is so, how could one acquire</b> an area that is only <b>rock</b> by establishing the presump-tion of ownership, as one does not plant rocky land? <b>Rather,</b> the presumption of ownership can be established <b>by standing animals on it or spreading produce on it. Here too, he should be required to stand animals on</b> the <i>beit rova</i> <b>or</b> to <b>spread produce on it.</b> If he did not profit from this small piece of land at all, he has not established the presumption of ownership with regard to it, and acquires only the rest of the field.
§ The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: What do you want,</b> i.e., what are you doing, <b>with this house</b> of mine? The other <b>said to him: I purchased it from you and I</b> worked and <b>profited</b> from <b>it</b> for the <b>years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. The claimant <b>said to him: I was among the distant settlements,</b> and was unaware that you were residing in my house, which is why I did not lodge a protest.
The one residing in the house <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> for a judgment. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Go clarify your profiting,</b> i.e., prove that you really resided there for three years, and then the case can be judged. <b>Rava said to</b> Rav Naḥman: Is <b>this the</b> correct <b>judgment?</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b> Therefore, the one who is attempting to take the house from the possessor should have to prove that the other did not reside in the house.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between this statement <b>of Rava and</b> another statement <b>of Rava, and</b> it <b>raises a contradiction</b> between this statement <b>of Rav Naḥman and</b> another statement <b>of Rav Naḥman. As</b> there was <b>a certain</b> person

Daf 30a

<b>who said to another: I</b> am hereby <b>selling to you all</b> of the <b>property</b> that I own <b>of the house of bar Sisin. There was a certain</b> parcel of <b>land that was called: Of the house of bar Sisin.</b> The seller <b>said to</b> the buyer: <b>This</b> parcel of land that I own is <b>not</b> actually <b>of the house of bar Sisin, and it is</b> merely <b>called: Of the house of bar Sisin,</b> and it is not included in the sale. <b>They came before Rav Naḥman</b> for judgment, and <b>he established</b> the land <b>in the possession of the buyer. Rava said to</b> Rav Naḥman: Is <b>this the <i>halakha</i>?</b> Isn’t the <i>halakha</i> that <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> and the land should remain in the possession of the seller?
The Gemara continues: There is <b>a difficulty</b> from one statement <b>of Rava to</b> another statement <b>of Rava,</b> and there is also <b>a difficulty</b> from one statement <b>of Rav Naḥman to</b> another statement <b>of Rav Naḥman,</b> as in the first case, where the claimant states that he had been in a distant location, Rav Naḥman ruled in favor of the claimant, and Rava ruled in favor of the possessor; while in the second case, that of the property of bar Sisin, their opinions were reversed.
The Gemara answers: The contradiction between one statement <b>of Rava and</b> another statement <b>of Rava</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> because <b>there,</b> in the case of the property of bar Sisin, the <b>seller</b> had been <b>established</b> as having the land <b>in his property,</b> which is why Rava rules in his favor. But <b>here,</b> in the case where the claimant states that he had been in a distant location, the <b>buyer</b> is <b>established</b> as having the house <b>in his property.</b>
The contradiction between one statement <b>of Rav Naḥman and</b> the other statement <b>of Rav Naḥman</b> is <b>not difficult as well,</b> because there, <b>since</b> the seller <b>said to him:</b> I am hereby selling you all of the property that I own <b>of the house of bar Sisin, and</b> this parcel of land is <b>called: Of the house of bar Sisin,</b> it is <b>incumbent on him to reveal that</b> the parcel under dispute is <b>not of the house of bar Sisin. But here,</b> in the case where the claimant states that he had been in a distant location, it <b>should not be</b> any <b>different</b> from a case <b>where</b> the possessor is <b>holding a document</b> as evidence that he purchased the house. <b>Wouldn’t we</b> then <b>say to him:</b> First <b>ratify your document, and</b> only then be <b>established in</b> the <b>property?</b> In this case as well, since his presumptive ownership is in place of a document, he needs to clarify the matter by means of witnesses.
There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: What do you want with this house</b> of mine? The possessor <b>said to him: I purchased it from you and I</b> worked and <b>profited from it</b> for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. The claimant <b>said to</b> him: <b>I was in</b> the <b>outer marketplaces,</b> and was unaware that you were residing in my house, and therefore did not lodge a protest, so your profiting does not establish the presumption of ownership. The possessor <b>said to him: But I have witnesses that every year you would come</b> here for <b>thirty days</b> and had an opportunity to know that I was residing in your house and to lodge a protest. The claimant <b>said to him: I was occupied with</b> my business in the <b>marketplaces</b> for those <b>thirty days. Rava said: A person is apt</b> to be <b>occupied</b> with business <b>in the marketplace for all</b> of <b>thirty days,</b> and accepted his claim.
There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: What do you want with this land</b> of mine? The possessor <b>said to him: I purchased it from so-and-so, who told me that he purchased it from you.</b> The claimant <b>said to him: Don’t you concede</b>

Daf 30b

<b>that this land is</b> formerly <b>mine, and</b> that <b>you</b> did <b>not purchase it from me? Go</b> away; <b>I am not legally answerable to you. Rava said:</b> The claimant <b>stated the <i>halakha</i> to</b> the possessor, as this is a legitimate claim, and Rava accepted his claim.
There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: What do you want with this land</b> of mine? The possessor <b>said to him: I purchased it from so-and-so and</b> then <b>I</b> worked and <b>profited from it</b> for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. The claimant <b>said to him: So-and-so is a robber</b> who robbed me of the field, and he did not have the authority to sell it to you.
The possessor <b>said to him: But I have witnesses that I came</b> and <b>consulted with you, and you said to me: Go purchase</b> the land, indicating that you conceded that he had the authority to sell it. The claimant <b>said to him:</b> The reason that I advised you to purchase it was because <b>the second</b> person, i.e., you, the possessor, <b>is amenable to me,</b> while <b>the first,</b> i.e., the purported thief, <b>is more difficult than he,</b> i.e., I prefer to litigate with you rather than with him. <b>Rava said:</b> The claimant <b>stated the <i>halakha</i> to</b> the possessor, as this is a legitimate claim, and Rava accepted his claim.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is Rava’s statement? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Admon? As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 109a): With regard to <b>one who contests</b> ownership <b>of a field,</b> claiming that a field possessed by someone else actually belongs to him, <b>and</b> the claimant himself <b>is signed as a witness on</b> the bill of sale of the field to that other person, <b>Admon says:</b> His signature does not disprove his claim of ownership of the property, as it is possible that the claimant said to himself: <b>The second</b> person <b>is amenable to me</b> to deal with, as I can reason with him, while <b>the first</b> owner, who sold the field to the current possessor, <b>is more difficult</b> to deal with <b>than he. And the Rabbis say: He lost his right</b> to contest, as he signed a bill of sale that states that the field belongs to the possessor. Rava’s ruling appears to be in accordance with the individual opinion of Admon, and not with the opinion of the Rabbis.
The Gemara explains: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that Rava’s ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. There,</b> in the case of the mishna in tractate <i>Ketubot</i>, by signing the bill of sale the claimant <b>performed an action</b> indicating that the field was not his <b>for</b> the benefit of the possessor of the field, <b>but here,</b> in Rava’s case, there was no action, only <b>speech,</b> and <b>a person is apt to casually say</b> statements, and he does not lose his right by virtue of this.
There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: What do you want with this land</b> of mine? The possessor <b>said to him: I purchased it from so-and-so and</b> then <b>I</b> worked and <b>profited from it</b> for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. The claimant <b>said to him: So-and-so is a robber</b> who robbed me of the field, and he did not have the authority to sell it to you. The possessor <b>said to him: But I have witnesses that you came</b> to me <b>at night and you said to me: Sell it to me,</b> indicating that it is not your land, as if it were yours, you would have demanded that I return it without your paying for it. The claimant <b>said to him: I said</b> to myself: Let me <b>purchase</b> the benefit of avoiding <b>my litigation</b> in order to reclaim my land. <b>Rava said: A person is apt</b> to pay money <b>to purchase</b> the benefit of avoiding <b>his litigation.</b>
There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: What do you want with this land</b> of mine? The possessor <b>said to him: I purchased it from so-and-so and</b> then <b>I</b> worked and <b>profited from it</b> for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, indicating that he possessed it for three years, as this is the minimum number of years required for establishing the presumption of ownership. The claimant <b>said to him: But I am holding a document</b> stating <b>that I purchased it from</b> that seller <b>four years</b> ago. Therefore, if it was sold to you three years ago, as you claim, he did not have the authority to sell it at that time.
The possessor <b>said to him: Do you maintain</b> that when I said: I profited from the land for <b>the years</b> necessary <b>for</b> establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, that <b>I was saying</b> I worked and profited from the land for precisely <b>three years?</b> What <b>I</b> actually <b>was saying</b> was that I worked and profited from the land for <b>many years</b> and thereby established the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. Since my purchase predated yours, it was effective. <b>Rava said:</b> It is <b>common</b> for <b>people to refer to many years</b> as: <b>Years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, and his claim is accepted.
The Gemara comments: <b>And this matter</b> applies <b>only</b> if <b>he profited</b> from the land for <b>seven</b> years, so <b>that presumptive</b> ownership <b>of this</b> possessor <b>preceded the document of that</b> claimant.

Daf 31a

<b>But</b> if he profited from the land for only <b>six</b> years, so that the sale to the claimant took place before the years necessary for establishing the presumption of ownership were completed, <b>you</b> can <b>have no greater protest than this,</b> that the purported seller then sold the land to another. By doing so he indicated that he does not concede that the possessor was the rightful owner, and the possessor should have been careful to hold on to his bill of sale for even longer than three years.
There was an incident where two people disputed the ownership of land. <b>This</b> one <b>says:</b> The land <b>belonged to my ancestors</b> and I inherited it from them, <b>and that</b> one <b>says:</b> The land <b>belonged to my ancestors</b> and I inherited it from them. <b>This</b> one <b>brings witnesses that</b> the land <b>belonged to his ancestors, and that</b> one <b>brings witnesses that</b> he currently possesses the land and that he worked and <b>profited</b> from the land for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.
<b>Rabba said:</b> The judgment is in favor of the possessor, due to the legal principle that if the judgment would have been decided in one’s favor had he advanced a certain claim, and he instead advanced a different claim that leads to the same ruling, he has credibility, as <b>why would he lie</b> and state this claim? <b>If</b> the possessor <b>wanted</b> to lie, he could have <b>said to</b> the claimant: <b>I purchased</b> the land <b>from you and I</b> worked and <b>profited from it</b> for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, in which case he would have been awarded the land. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>We do not say</b> the principle of: <b>Why would I lie, in</b> a case <b>where</b> there are <b>witnesses</b> contradicting his current claim, as they testify that the land belonged to the ancestors of the claimant. Therefore, he should not be awarded the land.
The possessor <b>then said to</b> the claimant: <b>Yes,</b> it is true that it had <b>belonged to your ancestors, but I purchased it from you, and</b> by stating <b>that which I said to you:</b> It <b>belonged to my ancestors,</b> I merely meant <b>that I rely upon</b> my ownership of <b>it as if</b> it belonged <b>to my ancestors,</b> as I purchased it and then profited from it for the years necessary for establishing the presumption of ownership.
The Gemara asks: Can he <b>state a claim and return and state</b> a modified version of his <b>claim,</b> or can he <b>not state a claim and return and state</b> a modified version of his <b>claim? Ulla said:</b> He can <b>state a claim and return and state</b> a modified version of his <b>claim.</b> The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say:</b> He <b>cannot state a claim and return and state</b> a modified version of his <b>claim.</b>
The Gemara clarifies their respective opinions: <b>And Ulla concedes</b> that in a case <b>where he</b> had initially <b>said to him:</b> The land <b>belonged to my ancestors and did not belong to your ancestors, that</b> he <b>cannot state a claim and return and state</b> a modified version of his <b>claim,</b> as Ulla allows the litigant only to reinterpret his initial claim, not to replace it with a contradictory claim. <b>And</b> Ulla also concedes that in a case <b>where he was standing in court and did not state</b> a particular <b>claim, and</b> he later <b>came in from outside</b> and back into the court <b>and</b> he <b>stated</b> that <b>claim,</b> that he <b>cannot return and state</b> that <b>claim. What is the reason</b> for this? It is because it is apparent that these <b>claims of his</b> were <b>taught to him</b> by someone after he left the court.
<b>And</b> the Sages <b>of Neharde’a concede</b> that in a case <b>where</b> the litigant who changed his claim <b>said to</b> the other litigant that when he had initially claimed: The land belonged to my ancestors, he had actually meant: It <b>belonged to my ancestors, who purchased it from your ancestors,</b> that he can state a claim and <b>return and state</b> a modified version of his <b>claim,</b> as this serves only to clarify, and not negate, his initial claim. <b>And</b> the Sages of Neharde’a also concede that in a case <b>where</b> he <b>discussed</b> the <b>matter outside</b> of the court <b>and</b> did <b>not</b> state a particular <b>claim, and</b> then he <b>came</b> in <b>to</b> the <b>court and stated</b> that <b>claim, that</b> he can <b>return and state</b> that <b>claim. What is the reason</b> for this? Because <b>a person is apt not to reveal his claims except to</b> the <b>court.</b>
<b>Ameimar said: I am</b> from <b>Neharde’a, but I</b> nevertheless <b>hold that</b> a litigant can <b>state a claim and return and state</b> a modified version of his <b>claim.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that a litigant can <b>state a claim and return and state</b> a modified version of his <b>claim.</b>
In an incident where two people dispute the ownership of land, <b>this</b> one <b>says:</b> The land <b>belonged to my ancestors</b> and I inherited it from them, <b>and that</b> one <b>says:</b> The land <b>belonged to my ancestors</b> and I inherited it from them. The first one <b>brings witnesses that</b> the land <b>belonged to his ancestors, and</b> that he worked and <b>profited</b> from the land for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>And</b> the second one <b>brings witnesses</b> only <b>that</b> he worked and <b>profited</b> from the land for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.
<b>Rav Naḥman said: Establish</b> the testimony with regard to the <b>profiting</b> by the first litigant <b>alongside</b> the testimony with regard to the <b>profiting</b> by the second, and the two testimonies cancel each other out, leaving the testimony with regard to ownership by the ancestors of the first litigant. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>establish the land in</b> the <b>presumptive ownership of</b> the litigant who brought witnesses that it belonged to his <b>ancestors. Rava</b> objected and <b>said to him: This testimony</b> cannot be relied on, as it <b>is contradicted</b> by the other testimony. Rav Naḥman responded and <b>said to him: Although</b> it is so <b>that</b> the testimony <b>was contradicted with regard to profiting</b> from the land,

Daf 31b

<b>was</b> the testimony <b>contradicted with regard to</b> ownership of <b>the ancestors?</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say that Rava and Rav Naḥman disagree in the dispute between Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda?</b>
<b>As</b> it <b>was stated</b> concerning <b>two groups of witnesses that contradict each other,</b> that <b>Rav Huna says: This</b> one <b>comes</b> to court <b>on its own and testifies, and that</b> one <b>comes</b> to court <b>on its own and testifies.</b> Despite the fact that one group certainly testified falsely, which should serve to disqualify one of the groups, each group is able to testify in another case. <b>And Rav Ḥisda says: Why do I</b> need <b>these lying witnesses?</b> In other words, they are all disqualified to testify in another case until it is clarified which of them had testified falsely. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman</b> is the one <b>who says</b> his ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, and Rava</b> says his ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda?</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b> who holds that the witnesses are disqualified, <b>everyone agrees</b> that the testimony concerning ancestral ownership is not accepted, as the witnesses were contradicted concerning their testimony of usage of the land, and Rav Naḥman’s ruling cannot accord with his opinion. <b>When</b> Rav Naḥman and Rava <b>disagree</b> it is <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna,</b> who does not disqualify the witnesses. The ruling of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna,</b> and he therefore accepts the testimony with regard to ancestral ownership, <b>and Rava</b> would say: <b>Rav Huna says</b> that the witnesses are accepted <b>only for another testimony,</b> i.e., in a different case. <b>But</b> they are <b>not</b> accepted <b>for the same testimony,</b> as in this incident, where both testimonies concerned ownership of the same land.
The Gemara relates the continuation of the case above. The one who had brought witnesses only to his having profited from the land <b>then brought witnesses that it</b> had belonged <b>to his ancestors,</b> thereby balancing the evidence for the two litigants. Therefore, <b>Rav Naḥman said: We</b> previously <b>brought down</b> to the land the one who initially had evidence of ancestral ownership to take possession of it, and <b>we</b> now <b>bring him up</b> from it, removing him from the land. And <b>we</b> are <b>not concerned about</b> the possible <b>contempt of court</b> that might result from perceived indecisiveness.
<b>Rava, and some say</b> it is <b>Rabbi Zeira, raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. If there was a married man whose fate was unknown, and <b>two</b> witnesses <b>say:</b> This married man <b>died, and two</b> witnesses <b>say: He did not die;</b> or if <b>two</b> witnesses <b>say:</b> This woman <b>was divorced, and two</b> witnesses <b>say: She was not divorced, this</b> woman <b>may not marry,</b> as there is not unequivocal testimony that she is no longer married, <b>but if she marries,</b> the marriage is valid and <b>she</b> need <b>not leave</b> her husband. <b>Rabbi Menaḥem, son of Rabbi Yosei, says: She</b> must <b>leave</b> her husband.
<b>Rabbi Menaḥem, son of Rabbi Yosei, said: When do I say</b> that <b>she</b> must <b>leave</b> her husband? She must leave him <b>in</b> a case <b>where witnesses came</b> to testify that she is still married <b>and she then married</b> despite their testimony. <b>But</b> if <b>she married and the witnesses then came</b> to testify that she is still married, <b>this</b> woman is <b>not</b> required to <b>leave</b> her husband based on the uncertainty created by contradictory witnesses. The fact that she is not required to leave her marriage in light of the new testimony seems to indicate an unwillingness to reverse the court’s ruling that she may marry, contrary to the ruling of Rav Naḥman.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I</b> had <b>thought to perform an action</b> and reverse the court’s ruling, but <b>now that you raised an objection against me, and Rav Hamnuna</b> also <b>raised a</b> similar <b>objection against me in Syria,</b> I will <b>not perform an action in this</b> matter.
The Gemara relates that Rav Naḥman then <b>went out</b> and <b>performed an action,</b> taking away the land from the litigant in whose favor he had previously ruled. <b>One who saw</b> what he did <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> made <b>a mistake, but</b> that <b>is not so. Rather,</b> he performed an action despite the objections that had been raised <b>because</b> the matter <b>depends on great authorities [<i>ashlei ravrevei</i>].</b> Since, as the Gemara will demonstrate, this issue is subject to dispute between great authorities, he relied on those that supported his opinion.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 23b): <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: One is not elevated to the</b> presumptive status of <b>priesthood on the basis</b> of the testimony <b>of one witness.</b> Two witnesses are required for that purpose. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: When</b> is that the <i>halakha</i>? <b>In</b> a case <b>where there are challengers</b> to his claim that he is a priest. <b>But in</b> a case <b>where there are no challengers, one is elevated to the</b> presumptive status of <b>priesthood on the basis</b> of the testimony <b>of one witness. Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabbi Shimon, son of the deputy</b> High Priest: <b>One is elevated to the</b> presumptive status of <b>priesthood on the basis</b> of the testimony <b>of one witness.</b>
The Gemara asks: The opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> as they agree that one is elevated to the presumptive status of priesthood on the basis of one witness when there are no challengers. What is their dispute? <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>there is</b> a practical difference <b>between them</b> in a case where there is <b>a challenge</b> posed by <b>one</b> person, as <b>Rabbi Elazar holds: A challenge</b> posed by <b>one</b> person is sufficient to undermine one’s presumptive status of priesthood, and two witnesses are required to overcome that challenge;

Daf 32a

<b>and Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel holds</b> that an effective <b>challenge</b> requires <b>two</b> witnesses, one could then ask: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say: Everyone agrees</b> that <b>there is no</b> effective <b>challenge</b> with <b>fewer than two</b> witnesses?
<b>Rather,</b> the <b>challenge</b> was established by <b>two</b> witnesses. <b>And with what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where we presume with regard to the father of that</b> man <b>that he is a priest, and a rumor emerged about</b> the son <b>that he is the son of</b> a priest and <b>a divorced woman, or the son of</b> a priest and <b>a <i>ḥalutza</i>, and we downgraded him</b> from the presumptive status of priesthood based on that rumor, <b>and one witness came and said that</b> the man in question <b>is a priest</b> of unflawed lineage, <b>and we elevated</b> him back to the priesthood, as one witness is sufficient to negate a rumor.
The Gemara continues the case: <b>And</b> then <b>two</b> witnesses <b>came and said that he is the son of a divorced woman or</b> the son of <b>a <i>ḥalutza</i>, and we downgraded him</b> from the priesthood based on their testimony. Then <b>one witness came and said that he is a priest</b> of unflawed lineage, resulting in two witnesses testifying that his lineage is unflawed, and two testifying that it is flawed. <b>And everyone</b> agrees that the <b>testimony</b> of the two single witnesses <b>combine</b> to produce testimony that he is a priest of unflawed lineage, and his presumptive status of priesthood should be restored.
The Gemara explains the dispute: <b>And here</b> it is <b>with regard to concern about contempt of court</b> that <b>they disagree. Rabbi Elazar holds: Once we downgraded him</b> from the presumptive status of priesthood based on the testimony of two witnesses, <b>we do not</b> then <b>elevate him,</b> as <b>we are concerned about contempt of court,</b> as a reversal in the court’s decision creates the impression that the court operates indecisively. <b>And Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel holds: We downgraded him</b> from the presumptive status of priesthood <b>and we</b> then <b>elevate him, and we are not concerned about contempt of court.</b> The primary concern is that the matter should be determined based on the relevant testimonies.
<b>Rav Ashi objects to</b> the analysis that they disagree with regard to concern about contempt of court: <b>If so, why specifically</b> is it necessary to establish the dispute in a case where first <b>one</b> witness testified as to his unflawed lineage, and then another testified later? <b>The same would hold true even in</b> a case where two witnesses testified together that he is unfit for the priesthood and the court downgraded him, and <b>two</b> witnesses testified together that he is fit for the priesthood and the court elevated him. The <i>tanna’im</i> would <b>also</b> disagree, as the same concern applies. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: Everyone</b> agrees that <b>we are not concerned about contempt of court. And here,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> whether the court is able <b>to combine</b> the <b>testimony</b> of two single witnesses that <b>they disagree, and</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the</b> following <b>dispute between these <i>tanna’im</i>.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 5:5): The <b>testimony</b> of individual witnesses <b>never combines unless</b> it is so <b>that the two of them see</b> the incident transpire together <b>as one. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says:</b> Their testimony combines <b>even in</b> a case where they witnessed the event <b>one after the other,</b> but <b>their testimony is established in court only</b> if it is so <b>that the two of them testify</b> together <b>as one. Rabbi Natan says:</b> They are not required to testify together. Their testimony is combined even if the court <b>hears the statement of this</b> witness <b>today and when the other</b> witness <b>arrives tomorrow</b> the court <b>hears his statement.</b> Rabbi Elazar and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel disagree in the dispute between Rabbi Natan and the Rabbis, whether the separate testimonies can be combined.
§ The Gemara relates an incident where two people disputed the ownership of land. There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: What do you want with this land</b> of mine? The possessor <b>said to him: I purchased it from you, and this</b> is <b>the bill</b> of sale.

Daf 32b

The first <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>It is a forged bill</b> of sale. The possessor <b>leaned</b> over and <b>whispered to Rabba: Yes, it is a forged bill. But I had a proper bill</b> of sale <b>and it was lost, and I said</b> to myself: <b>I will hold this</b> bill of sale <b>in my possession, such as it is.</b>
<b>Rabba said: Why would he lie</b> and state this claim? <b>If</b> he <b>wants</b> to lie, he can <b>say to him</b> that <b>it is a proper bill</b> of sale, and he would have been deemed credible and awarded the field. <b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Rabba: In the final analysis, <b>on what</b> are <b>you relying</b> to award him the land? <b>On this bill</b> of sale? <b>This</b> admittedly forged <b>bill is merely</b> a worthless <b>shard,</b> and cannot be used in court as evidence.
The Gemara relates a similar incident: There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: Give me one hundred dinars that I am</b> attempting to <b>collect from you, and this</b> is <b>the</b> promissory <b>note</b> that attests to the debt. The latter <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>It is a forged</b> promissory <b>note.</b> The first person <b>leaned</b> over and <b>whispered to Rava: Yes, it is a forged</b> promissory <b>note. But I had a proper</b> promissory <b>note and it was lost, and I said</b> to myself: <b>I will hold this</b> promissory note <b>in my possession, such as it is.</b>
<b>Rabba said: Why would he lie</b> and state this claim? <b>If</b> he <b>wants</b> to lie, he can <b>say to him</b> that <b>it is a proper</b> promissory <b>note,</b> and he will be deemed credible and awarded the money. <b>Rav Yosef said to</b> Rabba: In the final analysis, <b>on what</b> are <b>you relying</b> to award him the money? <b>On this</b> promissory <b>note? This document is merely a shard,</b> and cannot be used in court as evidence.
The Gemara notes the final ruling in these two cases. <b>Rav Idi bar Avin said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabba with regard to land,</b> and the possessor is awarded the land, <b>and the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef with regard to money,</b> and the one demanding payment is not awarded the money. He explains: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabba with regard to land,</b> as the court rules <b>that</b> the <b>land</b> should <b>remain where</b> it <b>is,</b> i.e., with the possessor. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef with regard to money,</b> as the court rules <b>that</b> the <b>money</b> should <b>remain where</b> it <b>is,</b> i.e., in the possession of the purported debtor.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain guarantor who said to a debtor: Give me one hundred dinars</b> for the money <b>that I repaid the creditor on your</b> behalf, <b>and this</b> is <b>the document</b> that I received from him when I repaid your debt. The debtor <b>said to</b> the guarantor: <b>Is it not</b> so that <b>I repaid you?</b> The guarantor <b>said</b> to the debtor: Yes, you did, but <b>is it not</b> so that <b>you later took the</b> money <b>from me</b> again?
<b>Rav Idi bar Avin sent</b> the following question <b>before Abaye: What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in <b>a case like this? Abaye sent him</b> the following response: <b>What does he,</b> i.e., Rav Idi bar Avin, <b>ask? Isn’t he</b> the one <b>who said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabba with regard to land, and the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef with regard to money,</b> as the court rules <b>that</b> the <b>money</b> should <b>remain where</b> it <b>is?</b> Based on his own ruling, the money should remain with the debtor.
The Gemara notes: <b>And this matter</b> applies only in a case <b>where</b> the guarantor <b>says to</b> the debtor: <b>You later borrowed</b> the money <b>from me</b> after you had repaid me. <b>But</b> if the guarantor <b>said to</b> the debtor: <b>I returned to you</b> the money that you had repaid me <b>because</b> of the fact <b>that</b> the coins <b>were worn out or</b> overly <b>reddish,</b> i.e., discolored, and would not be easily accepted as currency, then <b>the lien of the document is still</b> in effect. The debt to the guarantor had not actually been repaid, and the document is still in effect. In that case, the guarantor collects from the debtor.
The Gemara relates: <b>A rumor emerged concerning Rava bar Sharshom that</b> he <b>was profiting</b> from <b>land belonging to orphans. Abaye said to him: Tell me, my friend,</b> concerning <b>the incident itself, how is it</b> that this rumor was generated? Rava bar Sharshom <b>said to him: I was holding</b> on to <b>the land as collateral from the father of the orphans, and I had</b>

Daf 33a

<b>other money with him,</b> i.e., he owed me money for a different reason, for which I had no collateral, <b>and I profited from</b> the land <b>for</b> the duration of the <b>years of</b> the <b>collateral.</b>
<b>I</b> then <b>said</b> to myself: <b>If I return the land to the orphans</b> now that the years of collateral have finished, <b>and I say that I have other money with your</b> late <b>father,</b> I will not be able to collect it, as <b>the Sages say</b> that <b>one who comes to collect</b> a debt <b>from</b> the <b>property of orphans can collect only by</b> means of <b>an oath,</b> and I do not wish to take an oath. <b>Rather</b> than do that, <b>I will suppress</b> the <b>document</b> detailing the terms <b>of the collateral, and profit from</b> the land up to the <b>measure</b> of the <b>money</b> that their father owed me. This is legitimate, <b>since if I</b> so <b>desire I can say: It is purchased,</b> and that is why it is <b>in my possession,</b> and <b>I</b> would have been <b>deemed credible,</b> as I profited from the land for the years necessary to establish the presumption of ownership, so <b>when I say that I have money with you, I</b> am also <b>deemed credible.</b>
Abaye <b>said to</b> Rava bar Sharshom: Your reasoning is incorrect. You would <b>not have been able to say: It is purchased,</b> and that is why it is <b>in my possession, as</b> there <b>is publicity concerning it that</b> it <b>is land of orphans.</b> Therefore, you are unable to collect your debt based on the fact that you could have made a more advantageous claim [<i>miggo</i>]. <b>Rather, return</b> the land <b>to</b> the orphans now, <b>and when the orphans become adults,</b> then <b>litigate with them,</b> as you have no other option.
The Gemara relates: <b>A relative of Rav Idi bar Avin died and left a date tree</b> as an inheritance. Another relative took possession of the tree, claiming to be a closer relative than Rav Idi bar Avin. <b>Rav Idi bar Avin said: I am closer</b> in relation to the deceased than he, <b>and that man said: I am closer</b> in relation to the deceased than Rav Idi bar Avin. <b>Ultimately,</b> the other man <b>admitted to</b> Rav Idi bar Avin <b>that,</b> in fact, Rav Idi was <b>closer</b> in relation to the deceased. <b>Rav Ḥisda established</b> the date tree <b>in the possession of</b> Rav Idi bar Avin.
Rav Idi bar Avin <b>said to</b> Rav Ḥisda: The value of the <b>produce that he consumed</b> unlawfully <b>from that day</b> when he took possession of the tree <b>until now should be returned to me.</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said:</b> Is <b>this he about</b> whom people <b>say: He is a great man? On whom is the Master basing</b> his claim to receive the value of the produce? <b>On this</b> other relative. <b>But he was saying</b> until this point: <b>I am closer</b> in relation to the deceased than he. Therefore, you have ownership of the tree only from the time of his admission, and not from when he took possession of the tree. The Gemara comments: <b>Abaye and Rava do not hold</b> in accordance with <b>this</b> opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b>

Daf 33b

as they hold that <b>once</b> it is so <b>that</b> the other relative <b>admitted</b> that he is not a closer relative, <b>he admitted</b> that he never had any right to the produce of the tree. Therefore, by his own admission, he is liable to reimburse Rav Idi bar Avin.
§ There was an incident where two people dispute the ownership of land. <b>This</b> one <b>says:</b> The land <b>belonged to my ancestors</b> and I inherited it from them, <b>and that</b> one <b>says:</b> The land <b>belonged to my ancestors</b> and I inherited it from them. <b>This</b> one <b>brings witnesses that</b> the land <b>belonged to his ancestors, and that</b> one <b>brings witnesses that</b> he worked and <b>profited</b> from the land for <b>the years</b> necessary <b>for</b> establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.
<b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The one who is in possession of the land is deemed credible due to the legal principle that if one would have been deemed credible had he stated one claim but instead stated another claim that accomplishes the same result, he has credibility, because <b>why would he lie</b> and state this claim? <b>If</b> he <b>wants</b> to lie, he could have <b>said to him: I purchased it from you and I</b> worked and <b>profited from it</b> for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>Abaye and Rava do not hold</b> in accordance with <b>this</b> opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b> because they hold that <b>we do not say</b> that the principle of: <b>Why would I lie,</b> applies in a case <b>where</b> there are <b>witnesses</b> contradicting the claim he is stating, and in this case, witnesses testify that it belonged to the ancestors of the other claimant.
There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: What do you want with this land</b> of mine? The possessor <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>I purchased it from you and I</b> worked and <b>profited from it</b> for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. He then <b>went and brought witnesses that</b> he had <b>profited</b> from the land for <b>two years,</b> but he was unable to bring witnesses to testify about a third year. <b>Rav Naḥman said: The land reverts</b> back to the prior owner, <b>and</b> payment for <b>the produce</b> consumed during those two years <b>reverts</b> to the prior owner. Since the possessor was unable to substantiate his claim to the land, the assumption is that he consumed the produce unlawfully.
<b>Rav Zevid said: If</b> initially, when questioned by the other, the one occupying the land <b>claimed and said: I entered</b> the land <b>to</b> consume its <b>produce</b> that I had purchased, he is <b>deemed credible.</b> After all, <b>didn’t Rav Yehuda say: This one who is holding a sickle and rope [<i>vetovelaya</i>] and says: I will go cull [<i>igderei</i>]</b> the dates from <b>the date tree of so-and-so who sold it to me, is deemed credible</b> that he has the right to do so? <b>Apparently, a person is not</b> so <b>brazen that</b> he would <b>cull</b> the dates of <b>a date tree that is not his. Here too,</b> in the case discussed by Rav Zevid, <b>a person</b> is <b>not</b> so <b>brazen</b> as <b>to consume produce that is not his.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the assumption is that he would not lie, let one be deemed credible with regard to <b>the land as well.</b> The Gemara answers: In terms of <b>the land, we say to him: Show your bill</b> of sale if you indeed purchased it. The Gemara challenges: <b>If that is so,</b> then in terms of the <b>produce as well,</b> let him be deemed credible only if he can produce documentation of his claim. The Gemara explains: It is <b>not common</b> for <b>people</b> to write <b>documents to</b> establish the right to consume <b>produce</b> alone, and one can therefore claim to have consumed the produce based on an oral agreement.
There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: What do you want with this land</b> of mine? The possessor <b>said to him</b> in response: <b>I purchased it from you and I</b> worked and <b>profited from it</b> for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. He then <b>brought one witness</b> who testified <b>that</b> he <b>profited</b> from the land for the necessary <b>three years. The Rabbis</b> who were studying <b>before Abaye maintained</b> that it made sense <b>to say</b> that the principle in this case <b>is</b> the same as that in the case of the <b>piece of cast metal [<i>naskha</i>]</b> adjudicated <b>by Rabbi Abba.</b>
The Gemara now presents that case: <b>As</b> there was <b>a certain man who snatched a piece of cast metal from another.</b> The one from whom it was taken <b>came before Rabbi Ami</b> while <b>Rabbi Abba was sitting before him,</b> and he <b>brought one witness</b> who testified <b>that</b> it was, in fact, <b>snatched from him.</b> The one who snatched it <b>said to him: Yes,</b> it is true that <b>I snatched</b> it, <b>but I</b> merely <b>snatched</b> that which was <b>mine. Rabbi Ami said:</b>

Daf 34a

<b>How should judges judge for this judgment?</b> There are reasons not to implement all potential rulings. If they were to order the one who snatched the metal <b>to pay</b> for it, that would not be the correct ruling, because <b>there are not two witnesses</b> who saw him snatch it, and the court does not force payment based on the testimony of one witness. If they were <b>to</b> accept his claim and <b>exempt him</b> entirely, that would not be the correct ruling, because <b>there is one witness</b> who testified against him. If they were to order him <b>to take an oath,</b> which is the usual response to counter the testimony of one witness, <b>didn’t he say</b> that he did in fact <b>snatch it, and since he said that he snatched it</b> and there is no proof that it is his, <b>he is like a robber,</b> and the court does not allow a robber to take an oath.
<b>Rabbi Abba said to them: He</b> is one who <b>is liable</b> to take <b>an oath who is unable to take an oath, and anyone who is liable</b> to take <b>an oath who is unable to take an oath</b> is liable to <b>pay.</b> The Rabbis who were studying before Abaye thought that the case of the witness to the years of profiting and Rabbi Abba’s case are similar, in that since the possessor is unable to take an oath to refute the witness, as he concedes that he profited from the land for those years, he should have to pay for his consumption of the produce.
<b>Abaye said to</b> these Rabbis: <b>Are</b> these two cases <b>comparable? There,</b> in Rabbi Abba’s case, <b>the witness is coming to undermine</b> the position of the one who snatched the metal. This can be seen from the fact that <b>when</b> it would be the case that <b>another</b> witness <b>comes</b> to court and testifies <b>with</b> the first witness, <b>we</b> would <b>take away</b> the piece of metal <b>from</b> the one who snatched it. By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case of the individual who brought one witness to attest to his profiting from the land, the witness <b>is coming to support</b> the possessor. This can be seen from the fact that <b>when another</b> witness would <b>come</b> to court and testify with the first witness, <b>we</b> would <b>establish</b> the land <b>in his possession.</b> Therefore, the testimony of the one witness does not render the one who profited from the land liable to take an oath.
<b>Rather, if this</b> case <b>of Rabbi Abba is comparable</b> to a case such as this, it is comparable <b>to</b> a case where there is <b>one witness and</b> he testifies <b>to</b> someone’s profiting from land for <b>two years, and</b> the comparison is in terms of payment <b>for</b> the <b>produce</b> that he consumed. In terms of the consumption of the produce, two witnesses would have rendered the possessor liable to pay, as consumption of the produce for only two years does not establish the presumption of ownership. Therefore, one witness renders him liable to take an oath. Since he himself claimed that he profited from the land as the witness testified, he cannot take an oath to contest the testimony. Therefore, he would have to pay for the produce.

Daf 34b

§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain boat that two</b> people <b>were quarreling</b> about with regard to <b>its</b> ownership. <b>This</b> one <b>said: It is mine, and that</b> one also <b>said: It is mine. One of them came to court and said: Seize it until I</b> am able to <b>bring witnesses that it is mine.</b> The Gemara asks: In such a case, do <b>we seize</b> it <b>or</b> do <b>we not seize</b> it? <b>Rav Huna said: We seize</b> it. <b>Rav Yehuda said: We</b> do <b>not seize</b> it, as there is no cause for the court to intervene.
The court seized the boat. The one who requested of the court to seize it <b>went</b> to seek witnesses, <b>but did not find witnesses.</b> He then <b>said to</b> the court: <b>Release</b> the boat, <b>and whoever is stronger prevails,</b> as this is the ruling in a case where there is neither evidence nor presumptive ownership for either litigant. The Gemara asks: In such a case, do <b>we release</b> it <b>or</b> do <b>we not release</b> it? <b>Rav Yehuda said: We</b> do <b>not release</b> it. <b>Rav Pappa said: We release</b> it. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>we</b> do <b>not seize</b> property in a case where ownership is uncertain, <b>and where</b> it was <b>seized, we</b> do <b>not release</b> it.
There was an incident where two people dispute the ownership of property. <b>This</b> one <b>says:</b> It <b>belonged to my ancestors</b> and I inherited it from them, <b>and that</b> one <b>says:</b> It <b>belonged to my ancestors</b> and I inherited it from them. There was neither evidence nor presumptive ownership for either litigant. <b>Rav Naḥman said: Whoever is stronger prevails.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from</b> the case where two people produce <b>two deeds</b> of sale or gift for the same field <b>that are issued on one day,</b>

Daf 35a

<b>as Rav said:</b> In that case, <b>they should divide</b> the property between them, <b>and Shmuel said:</b> It is decided based on the <b>discretion [<i>shudda</i>] of the judges.</b> Why in the seemingly equivalent case of a dispute where there is no evidence for either litigant did Rav Naḥman rule that whoever is stronger prevails? The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of the two deeds, it will <b>not be</b> possible for the court <b>to clarify the matter</b> in the future, and therefore, the court issues a ruling according to the information they currently have. <b>Here,</b> in the case of Rav Naḥman, it may <b>be</b> possible for the court <b>to clarify the matter</b> in the future, if one of the litigants was to bring witnesses supporting his claim.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 100a): With regard to <b>one who exchanges a cow for a donkey and</b> the cow <b>calved, and similarly one who sells his</b> Canaanite <b>maidservant and she gave birth,</b> and <b>this</b> one, i.e., the seller, <b>says: She gave birth before I sold</b> either the cow or maidservant, and the offspring belongs to me; <b>and that</b> one, i.e., the buyer, <b>says: She gave birth after I purchased her</b> and the offspring belongs to me, the ruling is that <b>they should divide</b> the value of the newborn. In that case, the court is not able to clarify the matter, so they should rule that whoever is stronger prevails.
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of the exchange, <b>for this</b> one, i.e., the buyer,

Daf 35b

<b>he has financial involvement [<i>derara</i>], and for that</b> one, i.e., the seller, <b>he has financial involvement.</b> Since each of them has a definite claim to owning the offspring, as each of them owned the cow or maidservant at one point, it is reasonable for the court to divide the offspring between the two parties. By contrast, <b>here,</b> in the case of Rav Naḥman, <b>if</b> it belongs <b>to</b> this <b>Master</b> it does <b>not</b> belong <b>to</b> that <b>Master, and if</b> it belongs <b>to</b> that <b>Master</b> it does <b>not</b> belong <b>to</b> this <b>Master.</b> Only one of the two litigants has any claim to the property, as it belonged either to the ancestors of this one or of that one. Therefore, a ruling to divide it would not be appropriate.
The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say:</b> In a case where two parties disputed the ownership of a certain property and the court ruled that whoever is stronger prevails, <b>if one from the marketplace</b> who had no claim <b>came and took possession of it,</b> the court <b>does not remove it from his possession, as Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Kamma</i> 10:14): <b>A robber of</b> the <b>public,</b> meaning a robber whose victim is unknown, <b>is not called a robber.</b> Since it is unclear whom he robbed, no one is able to demand payment. Here too, since it is unclear whose property it is, neither can demand that it be taken from the robber.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> in disagreement: <b>Actually,</b> he <b>is called a robber,</b> and the property is taken from him, <b>and what</b> is meant by: He <b>is not called a robber?</b> It means <b>that</b> the stolen item is <b>not subject to being returned,</b> and consequently he is unable to fully atone, as he does not know whom to repay.
§ The mishna teaches with regard to certain types of property that <b>their presumptive ownership</b> is established by use of a duration of <b>three years from day to day.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Rabbi Abba says:</b> Nevertheless, there are cases where presumptive ownership is established immediately. For example, <b>if</b> the prior owner <b>himself lifted a basket of fruit</b> from that field <b>for</b> the possessor, that <b>immediately is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, and the prior owner can no longer lodge a protest. <b>Rav Zevid says: But if</b> the prior owner <b>stated a claim and said: I brought him down</b> into my field solely <b>to</b> consume the <b>produce,</b> e.g., as a sharecropper, he is <b>deemed credible. And that</b> <i>halakha</i>, that the prior owner is deemed credible were he to state such a claim, <b>applies</b> only if he stated it <b>within three</b> years of when the other took possession, <b>but after three</b> years he is <b>not</b> deemed credible.
<b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: If</b> in fact he did <b>bring him down</b> into the field solely <b>to</b> consume the <b>produce, what was</b> there <b>for him to do</b> to prevent the possessor from establishing the presumption of ownership? Rav Kahana <b>said to him: He should have protested</b> during the first three years and publicized that he had granted the possessor rights to the produce alone.
The assumption that lodging a protest would be effective must be correct, <b>since if you do not say so,</b> then in the case of <b>this mortgage</b> according to the custom <b>in Sura,</b> a city in Babylonia, <b>in</b> which is <b>written: At the completion of these years this land will be released</b> to its prior owner <b>without</b> any need for the prior owner to give <b>money, if</b> the creditor were to <b>hide</b> the <b>mortgage document in his possession and say:</b> This land <b>is purchased</b> and that is why it is <b>in my possession, here</b> is it <b>also</b> the case <b>that</b> he would be <b>deemed credible?</b> That cannot be, as is it reasonable that <b>the Sages would institute a matter,</b> such as this type of arrangement, <b>that</b> people <b>can be led by it to</b> suffer <b>a loss? Rather,</b> in the case of the mortgage the debtor <b>should have protested,</b> and by not protesting, he causes his own loss. <b>Here, too,</b> in the case of the field, the owner <b>should have protested.</b>
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>a Jew who comes</b> to claim land <b>due to</b> having received it from <b>a gentile, he is like a gentile</b> in terms of which legal claims are available to him. Therefore, <b>just as a gentile has</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>only by</b> means of <b>a document, so too, a Jew who comes</b> to claim land <b>due to</b> having received it from <b>a gentile has</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>only by</b> means of <b>a document. Rava said: And if</b> the <b>Jew said</b> to a prior owner, who claims to still own the land:

Daf 36a

The <b>gentile told me that</b> he <b>purchased</b> a field <b>from you,</b> this claim is <b>deemed credible.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is there any case where if a gentile says</b> it <b>he is not deemed credible, but if a Jew said</b> it <b>in the gentile’s name he would be deemed credible?</b>
<b>Rather, Rava said: If a Jew said</b> to the prior owner: <b>A gentile purchased</b> a field <b>from you in my presence, and</b> then he <b>sold it to me,</b> this claim is <b>deemed credible, since if he wanted</b> to, he could have <b>said to</b> the prior owner of the land: <b>I purchased it from you.</b>
The Gemara records a series of <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to presumptive ownership. <b>And Rav Yehuda says: This one who is holding a sickle and rope and says: I will go cull</b> the dates from <b>the date tree of so-and-so, from whom I purchased it,</b> is <b>deemed credible.</b> The reason for this is that <b>a person is not</b> so <b>brazen that</b> he would <b>cull</b> the dates from <b>a date tree that is not his.</b>
<b>And Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>this one, who possesses</b> a field only <b>from the fence</b> built to prevent the entry <b>of the wild donkeys and outward</b> toward the public property, this conduct <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>What is the reason?</b> The owner <b>says</b> to himself: <b>Everything that</b> he <b>sows,</b> the <b>wild donkeys</b> will <b>eat as well,</b> and cannot establish the presumption of ownership for him, as he is not profiting from the land as an owner would.
<b>And Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to one who <b>profited</b> from the land by consuming <b>produce from the first three years after it was planted [<i>orla</i>],</b> during which time one is prohibited from deriving benefit from the produce, this conduct <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who <b>profited</b> from the land by consuming <b><i>orla</i></b> produce, or profited from the land by consuming produce of the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>or</b> consumed produce that was prohibited as it was of <b>diverse kinds,</b> this conduct <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.
<b>Rav Yosef says:</b> With regard to one who <b>profited</b> from the land by consuming <b>fodder,</b> i.e., produce that has grown stalks but is not yet ripe, this conduct <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>Rava said: But if</b> the land was <b>located in</b> the <b>neck of Meḥoza,</b> a valley where it was common to harvest unripe produce to feed animals, this conduct <b>is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.
<b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> Consumption of produce of land that is <b>fissured is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. This is due to the fact that produce does not grow well there, and therefore, owners do not bother to protest if a trespasser uses the land. Therefore, their silence should not be understood as an admission that it belongs to the possessor. Similarly, consumption of produce of land where one <b>expends a <i>kor</i></b> of seed to sow <b>and retrieves a <i>kor</i></b> of produce when harvesting it, <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. Here, too, the owners do not bother to protest, as the land is of inferior quality.
Rav Naḥman continues: <b>And these</b> members <b>of the household of the Exilarch</b> do <b>not establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>in our</b> land, as people are afraid to lodge a protest against them, <b>and we do not establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>in their</b> land, as, due to their wealth, they might not lodge a protest against one who trespasses on their land.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> of <b>slaves,</b> presumption of ownership of them is established by using them for a duration of three years from day to day. The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>slaves, is</b> there <b>presumptive ownership of them? But doesn’t Reish Lakish say:</b> With regard to <b>livestock [<i>hagoderot</i>], possession of them does not</b> establish the presumption of ownership, since they wander from place to place. Therefore, one cannot claim that his mere possession of livestock demonstrates ownership as one can with regard to other movable items, because it may have wandered into his property on its own. The same <i>halakha</i> should apply with regard to a slave. <b>Rava said:</b> It is true that <b>possession of them does not</b> establish the presumption of ownership <b>immediately, but there is presumptive ownership of them after three years.</b>
<b>Rava said: If</b> the slave in question <b>was a small</b> child <b>placed in a cradle, possession of him does</b> establish the presumption of ownership <b>immediately,</b> as it does with regard to other movable items. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious,</b> since he cannot move on his own? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where he has a mother. Lest you say:</b> One <b>should be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps his mother brought him up to there,</b> and his being on another’s property does not indicate that the latter is his master. Therefore, Rava <b>teaches us</b> that there is no concern about this possibility, since <b>a mother does not forget her son.</b> Therefore, possession of the infant slave does establish the presumption of ownership.
The Gemara relates: There were <b>these</b> certain <b>goats that ate peeled</b> barley [<b><i>ḥushela</i></b>] <b>in Neharde’a. The owner of</b> the <b>peeled</b> barley <b>came and seized</b> the goats, <b>and was claiming a large</b> sum of money for the barley from the owner of the goats. <b>Shmuel’s father said:</b> He <b>is able to claim up to</b> the <b>value of</b> the goats, <b>since if</b> he <b>wants</b> to, he could <b>say:</b> The goats <b>are purchased</b> and that is why they are <b>in my possession.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Reish Lakish say:</b> With regard to <b>livestock,</b> possession of them <b>does not</b> establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership? The Gemara answers: <b>Goats are different, as</b> they are <b>given to shepherds,</b> and do not wander on their own.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But there is morning and evening</b> to consider, when the goats are unsupervised when traveling between the owner and the shepherd, and during those times this <i>halakha</i> of livestock should apply with regard to them. The Gemara explains: The case under discussion took place in Neharde’a, and <b>Arabs [<i>tayya’ei</i>]</b> who steal animals <b>are common in Neharde’a, and</b> goats there are <b>delivered from hand to hand</b> and are never left unsupervised.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yishmael says: Three months</b> of possession in the first year, three months of possession in the third year, and twelve months of possession in the middle, which are eighteen months, suffices to establish the presumption of ownership. Rabbi Akiva disagrees, and says that one month in the first and third year, in addition to the full middle year, is sufficient. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that the difference <b>between them is</b> whether <b>plowing</b> the land is sufficient to establish the presumption of ownership? <b>As Rabbi Yishmael holds</b> that <b>plowing is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, and three months are needed for the crop to grow, <b>and Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>plowing is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, and therefore one month is sufficient.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> their opinions this way? If so, <b>according to Rabbi Akiva, why specifically</b> require a full <b>month?</b>

Daf 36b

<b>Even</b> if he plowed the land for <b>one day</b> in the first and third years respectively, it should be sufficient to establish the presumption of ownership. <b>Rather, everyone</b> agrees that <b>plowing is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, <b>and here</b> the difference <b>between</b> their opinions is whether in order to establish the presumption of ownership one needs to possess the land long enough to grow <b>major produce,</b> which requires three months to grow, <b>or</b> only <b>minor produce,</b> which requires one month.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Plowing is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say: This is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>Whose</b> opinion is it that the <i>baraita</i> refers to as: <b>There are</b> those <b>who say? Rav Ḥisda said:</b> It <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Aḥa, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the possessor <b>plowed</b> the field for <b>a year and sowed it</b> for <b>two</b> years, or if he <b>plowed it</b> for <b>two</b> years <b>and sowed it</b> for <b>a year,</b> it <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>Rabbi Aḥa says: This is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, which indicates that he holds that plowing establishes the presumption of ownership.
<b>Rav Ashi said: I asked all</b> of the <b>great</b> men <b>of the generation</b> about this, <b>and they said to me:</b> With regard to <b>plowing, this is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>Rav Beivai said to Rav Naḥman: What is the reason of the one who says</b> that <b>plowing is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership? Rav Naḥman answered: <b>A person is not apt to</b> have <b>his land plowed</b> by someone else <b>and</b> remain <b>silent.</b> Rav Beivai asked: <b>And what is the reason of the one who says</b> that <b>plowing is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership? Rav Naḥman answered: The owner <b>says</b> to himself: Let <b>each and every clump [<i>shibba</i>]</b> of earth <b>enter</b> the plow. That is to say, the owner is amenable to having someone else plow the land for him, and then he will sow and harvest.
The <b>residents of Pum Nahara sent</b> a question <b>to Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda. Our teacher, instruct us: Is plowing</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, <b>or is</b> it <b>not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership? Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda <b>said to them: Rabbi Aḥa and all</b> of the <b>great</b> men <b>of the generation say:</b> With regard to <b>plowing, this is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> Is it <b>a novelty to enumerate</b> great <b>men</b> who maintain an opinion without taking into account that of others? <b>But</b> what of <b>Rav and Shmuel in Babylonia, and Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva in Eretz Yisrael,</b> who <b>say: Plowing is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership?
The Gemara presents the sources for ascribing to these Sages the opinion that plowing does not establish the presumption of ownership. The basis for ascribing it to <b>Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva is the mishna,</b> as the Gemara explained above. <b>What is</b> the basis for ascribing this opinion to <b>Rav? As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: This</b> ruling that either a month or three months is sufficient use for the first and third years is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva, but the Rabbis,</b> whose opinion is accepted, <b>say:</b> With regard to a field, <b>its presumption</b> of ownership is established by <b>three years, from day to day.</b> The phrase: <b>From day to day,</b> serves <b>to exclude what?</b> Does it <b>not</b> serve <b>to exclude plowing, which does not</b> establish the presumption of ownership?
<b>What is</b> the basis for ascribing this opinion to <b>Shmuel? As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: This</b> ruling that either a month or three months is sufficient use for the first and third years is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva, but the Rabbis,</b> whose opinion is accepted, <b>say:</b> He does not establish the presumption of ownership <b>until</b> he <b>harvests three</b> date <b>crops, or harvests three</b> grape <b>crops, or harvests three</b> olive <b>crops.</b> This indicates that Shmuel holds that plowing does not establish the presumption of ownership. <b>What</b> is the difference <b>between</b> the opinions of Rav and Shmuel? <b>Abaye said:</b> The difference <b>between</b> their opinions is whether three harvests of <b>a young [<i>na’ara</i>] date tree, which produces</b> a crop <b>three times in</b> one <b>year,</b> establishes the presumption of ownership.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yishmael said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that eighteen months are required to establish the presumption of ownership of a non-irrigated field, <b>said? With regard to a white field,</b> i.e., a grain field. But with regard to an orchard, harvesting three different crops suffices. <b>Abaye said: From</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yishmael we infer</b> the proper understanding of a detail of the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> who disagree with him, and hold that three years of harvesting one crop is required to establish the presumption of ownership even with regard to an orchard: If <b>one had thirty trees</b> of one type in a field, and they were <b>planted</b> with a density of <b>ten trees per</b> each <b>area required for sowing one <i>se’a</i> of seed [<i>beit se’a</i>],</b> and one <b>consumed</b> the produce of <b>ten</b> trees <b>in this</b> first <b>year, and</b> of another <b>ten</b> trees <b>in this</b> second <b>year, and</b> of another <b>ten</b> trees <b>in this</b> third <b>year, this is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.

Daf 37a

The Gemara explains the inference from the statement of Rabbi Yishmael and how it clarifies the opinion of the Rabbis: <b>Didn’t Rabbi Yishmael say</b> that harvesting <b>one</b> type of <b>fruit is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>for all</b> of the types of <b>fruit,</b> i.e., for the entire field? <b>Here too, these</b> trees <b>are</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>for those</b> trees, <b>and those</b> trees <b>are</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>for these</b> trees.
The Gemara notes two restrictions to the aforementioned ruling: <b>And this statement</b> applies specifically <b>where</b> the other twenty trees <b>did not produce</b> fruit, <b>but</b> if the other trees <b>produced</b> fruit <b>and</b> he did <b>not consume</b> their fruit, then his conduct <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership with regard to the other trees. <b>And this</b> principle, that consuming the produce of some of the trees each year establishes the <b>presumption</b> of ownership for the entire field, applies only if it is the case <b>that</b> the trees <b>are scattered [<i>devazei bazuzei</i>]</b> throughout the field. Otherwise, he establishes the <b>presumption</b> of ownership only over the section where the trees are located.
§ In a case where there was a field with trees in it, and <b>this</b> person <b>took possession of the trees and that</b> person <b>took possession of the land, Rav Zevid says: This</b> one <b>acquired</b> the <b>trees and that</b> one <b>acquired</b> the <b>land. Rav Pappa objects to this: If</b> this is <b>so,</b> then the <b>owner</b> of the <b>trees has no</b> share <b>in the land at all. Let</b> the <b>owner</b> of the <b>land say to</b> the <b>owner</b> of the <b>trees: Uproot your trees, take</b> them, <b>and go. Rather, Rav Pappa said: This</b> one <b>acquired</b> the <b>trees and half</b> of the <b>land, and that</b> one <b>acquired half</b> of the <b>land.</b>
The Gemara notes: It is <b>obvious</b> that if one <b>sold</b> a section of <b>land and left</b> the ownership of the <b>trees</b> in that land <b>for himself, he has</b> ownership of the <b>land</b> surrounding the trees. <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says: One who sells, sells generously,</b> and he is presumed to have included in the sale even items that were not explicitly specified, because <b>that statement</b> applies only <b>concerning</b> a case such as when one sold land and retained ownership of <b>a pit or a cistern.</b> In that case, Rabbi Akiva ruled that he does not retain any land, not even a path to access the pit or cistern, as he sold generously, including all of the land in the sale.
The Gemara explains the difference between the cases: That ruling applies there, <b>as</b> the pit or cistern <b>causes no harm to the land</b> surrounding them, and since the seller does not foresee a conflict arising from his pit and cistern being located adjacent to the buyer’s property, he therefore transfers the entire land. <b>But</b> in the case of his retaining the <b>trees,</b>

Daf 37b

<b>since they are causing harm to the land,</b> the seller does <b>leave</b> the land that is surrounding the trees for himself, <b>as if</b> he did <b>not leave</b> it, <b>let</b> the buyer <b>say to him: Uproot your trees and go.</b>
The Gemara discusses the reverse case: If one <b>sold</b> the <b>trees and left</b> the ownership of the <b>land for himself,</b> the <i>halakha</i> depends on <b>the</b> outcome of the <b>dispute of Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis. According to Rabbi Akiva, who says: One who sells, sells generously,</b> the buyer <b>has</b> ownership of the land surrounding the trees, as the presumption is that the seller included it in the sale. <b>According to the Rabbis,</b> who say: One who sells, sells sparingly, the buyer <b>does not have</b> ownership of the land surrounding the trees, as the presumption is that the seller did not include it in the sale.
The Gemara stated previously that <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> the buyer <b>has</b> ownership of the land surrounding the trees. The Gemara clarifies this opinion: <b>And even according to Rav Zevid, who said</b> (37a) that in a case where one took possession of the land and another took possession of the trees, the one who took possession of the trees <b>has no</b> share in the land, <b>that matter</b> applies only <b>concerning</b> the case of <b>two buyers. As</b> in that case, the one who acquired the land can <b>say to</b> the other: <b>Just as</b> it is so <b>that I have no</b> share <b>in</b> the <b>trees, you also have no</b> share <b>in the land; but here,</b> where one sold the trees and left the land for himself, <b>one who sells, sells generously.</b> Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the sale included the land surrounding the trees.
The Gemara stated earlier that <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> the buyer does <b>not have</b> ownership of the land surrounding the trees. The Gemara clarifies this opinion: <b>And even according to Rav Pappa, who says</b> above that in a case where one took possession of the land and another took possession of the trees that the one who took possession of the trees <b>has</b> ownership of half of the land as well, <b>that matter</b> applies only <b>concerning</b> the case of <b>two buyers. As</b> in that case, the one who acquired the trees can <b>say to</b> the other: <b>Just as</b> it is so <b>that</b> the seller <b>sold to you generously,</b> as you have both the land and the right to consume its produce, he <b>also sold to me generously,</b> including the land surrounding the trees; <b>but here,</b> where one sold the trees and left the land for himself, <b>one who sells, sells sparingly,</b> retaining for himself whatever he did not explicitly include in the sale.
§ The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say:</b> If one <b>consumed</b> the produce of <b>an overcrowded</b> orchard, <b>he</b> does <b>not</b> thereby <b>have presumptive ownership</b> of the orchard. <b>Rava objects to this: If that is so, how</b> does one ever <b>acquire this alfalfa field,</b> which is planted without spacing? <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> If one <b>sold an overcrowded</b> orchard, the buyer does <b>not have</b> ownership of the <b>land</b> surrounding the trees. Generally, if one purchases three or more trees, he acquires the surrounding land, as the trees are considered an orchard. If the trees are overcrowded, they will soon have to be uprooted, and that is why the buyer does not acquire the land surrounding the trees.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said:</b> This is <b>like</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> (<i>Kilayim</i> 5:2): With regard to <b>a vineyard that is planted on</b> an area where there is <b>less than four cubits</b> of open space between the vines, <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> It is <b>not</b> considered to be <b>a vineyard</b> with regard to the prohibition of diverse kinds and other <i>halakhot</i>, as it is overcrowded. <b>And the Rabbis say: This is</b> considered to be <b>a vineyard, and</b> the reason for this is that <b>the middle</b> vines are <b>viewed as if</b> they <b>are not</b> there, and the outer vines meet the requirements for a vineyard. It follows that according to the opinion of the Rabbis, if one sold an overcrowded orchard, the middle trees would be viewed as if they were not there. Therefore, it would be considered an orchard and the buyer would acquire the land surrounding the trees.
The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: This one who sells a date tree to another,</b> the buyer <b>acquires</b> the land <b>from its bottom until the depths.</b>

Daf 38a

<b>Rava objects to this</b> ruling that the buyer of the tree acquires the land beneath it: <b>And let</b> the seller <b>say to him: I sold you</b> only <b>the saffron crocus,</b> a small plant normally uprooted by the buyer and taken with him. Therefore, <b>uproot the saffron crocus and go. Rather, Rava said:</b> This ruling is stated <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>comes</b> to court <b>with</b> a specific <b>claim</b> that the seller had stipulated that he would acquire the land. Without this specific claim he does not acquire the land beneath the tree.
<b>Mar Kashisha, the son of Rav Ḥisda, said to Rav Ashi: And if,</b> in fact, the seller <b>sold him the saffron crocus, what was</b> there <b>for</b> the seller <b>to do</b> to prevent the buyer from claiming the land beneath the tree, as the buyer could claim that there had been an explicit stipulation that he receive it? Rav Ashi answered: <b>He should have protested</b> during the first three years and publicized that the land was not included in the sale.
The assumption that lodging a protest would be effective must be correct, <b>since if you do not say so,</b> then in the case of <b>these mortgages</b> according to the custom <b>in Sura,</b> a city in Babylonia, the debtor will not have a way to prevent the creditor from keeping his land. <b>As in</b> mortgages of that type it is <b>written like this: At the completion of these years this land will be released</b> to its prior owner <b>without</b> any need for the prior owner to give <b>money. If</b> the creditor were to <b>hide</b> the <b>mortgage document in his possession and say:</b> This land <b>is purchased</b> and that is why it is <b>in my possession, here</b> is it <b>also</b> the case <b>that</b> he would be <b>deemed credible?</b> That cannot be, as is it reasonable that <b>the Sages would institute a matter,</b> such as this type of arrangement, <b>that</b> people <b>can be led by it to</b> suffer <b>a loss? Rather,</b> in the case of the mortgage the debtor <b>should have protested,</b> and by not protesting, he causes his own loss. <b>Here too,</b> in the case of the tree, the owner <b>should have protested.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There are <b>three</b> independent <b>lands</b> in Eretz Yisrael <b>with regard to</b> establishing <b>presumptive ownership: Judea, and Transjordan, and the Galilee.</b> If the prior owner of the field <b>was in Judea and</b> another <b>took possession</b> of his field <b>in the Galilee,</b> or if he was <b>in the Galilee and</b> another <b>took possession</b> of his field <b>in Judea,</b> the possessor does <b>not</b> establish <b>presumptive ownership until</b> the one possessing the field <b>will be with</b> the prior owner <b>in one province. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that establishing presumptive ownership requires <b>three years only in order that</b> if the owner <b>will be in Spain [<i>Aspamya</i>], and</b> another <b>possesses</b> his field for <b>a year,</b> people <b>will go and inform</b> the owner by the end of the next <b>year, and</b> the owner will <b>come</b> back <b>in</b> the <b>following year</b> and take the possessor to court.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What does the first <i>tanna</i> hold</b> in ruling that the prior owner and the field need be in the same province in order for the possessor to establish presumptive ownership? <b>If he holds</b> that <b>a protest that is</b> lodged <b>not in the presence of</b> the one possessing the field <b>is</b> a valid <b>protest, even</b> in the case where one is in <b>Judea and</b> one is in the <b>Galilee,</b> the protest should be valid <b>as well. If he holds</b> that <b>a protest</b> lodged <b>not in his presence is not</b> a valid <b>protest, even</b> in the case where one is in <b>Judea and</b> the other one is in <b>Judea,</b> the protest should <b>not</b> be valid <b>as well.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel says</b> that <b>Rav says: Actually,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>holds</b> that <b>a protest</b> lodged <b>not in his presence is</b> a valid <b>protest, and</b> the Sages <b>taught our mishna with regard to a period of crisis,</b> when travel is perilous and information cannot be transmitted between Judea and the Galilee. Therefore, although no word of a protest was received, the possessor does not establish presumptive ownership of the field. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if it is due only to the exigent circumstances that word of the protest does not reach the one possessing the field, <b>what is different</b> about <b>Judea and</b> the <b>Galilee that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>cited?</b> Ostensibly, even within one of the three lands, if travel and communications are restricted the same <i>halakha</i> would apply.
The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i>, by citing specifically a case where each is located in a different land, <b>teaches us this:</b>

Daf 38b

<b>That an ordinary</b> situation with regard to travel between <b>Judea and</b> the <b>Galilee is tantamount to a period of crisis.</b>
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> One <b>cannot establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to the property of</b> one who is <b>fleeing,</b> as he is unable to lodge a protest. Rav Yehuda reports: <b>When I said this</b> ruling <b>before Shmuel, he</b> disagreed and <b>said to me: But does</b> the owner actually <b>have to protest in</b> the <b>presence of</b> the possessor? Since that is not the case, and he can lodge a protest wherever he is, one can establish the presumption of ownership with regard to the property of one who is fleeing.
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav,</b> who ruled that one cannot establish the presumption of ownership with regard to the property of one who is fleeing, <b>what is</b> he <b>teaching us,</b> that <b>a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is not</b> a valid <b>protest? But doesn’t Rav say: A protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is</b> a valid <b>protest?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rav was explaining</b> the <b>reason of the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>but</b> he <b>himself does not hold accordingly.</b> Rav holds, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, that the protest is valid.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> a different version of the previous discussion: <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> One <b>can establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to the property of</b> one who is <b>fleeing.</b> Rav Yehuda reports: <b>When I said this</b> ruling <b>before Shmuel, he said to me:</b> Isn’t that <b>obvious? But does</b> the owner actually <b>have to protest in</b> the <b>presence of</b> the possessor?
The Gemara asks: <b>And Rav,</b> who ruled that one can establish the presumption of ownership with regard to the property of one who is fleeing, <b>what is</b> he <b>teaching us,</b> that <b>a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is</b> a valid <b>protest? But Rav</b> already <b>said this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>one time,</b> and he would not need to repeat it. <b>Rather,</b> Rav <b>teaches us this: That even if</b> the owner <b>protested in the presence of two</b> witnesses <b>who are</b> personally <b>unable to tell</b> the possessor about the protest, <b>it is</b> nevertheless a valid <b>protest.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>As Rav Anan said:</b> This <b>was explained to me personally by Shmuel himself:</b> If the owner <b>protested in the presence of two people who are able to</b> personally <b>tell</b> the possessor, <b>it is</b> a valid <b>protest,</b> but if the owner <b>protested in the presence of two people who are unable to</b> personally <b>tell</b> the possessor, <b>it is not</b> a valid <b>protest. And</b> why does <b>Rav</b> hold that it is a valid protest? Because <b>your friend</b> who heard the protest <b>has a friend</b> to whom he tells about the protest, <b>and your friend’s friend has a friend</b> to whom he tells about the protest, and so forth. Therefore, word of the protest will reach the possessor.
<b>Rava says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that one <b>cannot establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to the property of</b> one who is <b>fleeing, and a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in</b> a possessor’s <b>presence is</b> a valid <b>protest.</b> The Gemara asks: How can he say these <b>two</b> statements that contradict each other? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> the second statement, is referring to a case where he is <b>fleeing due to monetary</b> difficulties. In such a case, he is able to ensure that the protest reaches the possessor, while <b>there,</b> the first statement, is referring to a case where he is <b>fleeing due to</b> a charge of <b>killing [<i>meradin</i>].</b> In such a case, he is unable to publicize his protest out of fear of revealing his whereabouts.
§ The Gemara presents a series of disputes with regard to what is considered a valid protest. <b>What manner</b> of statement constitutes <b>a protest? Rav Zevid said:</b> If the owner says in general terms: <b>So-and-so is a robber, it is not</b> a valid <b>protest,</b> but if he says: <b>So-and-so is a robber as</b> he <b>is holding my land through robbery,</b>

Daf 39a

<b>and tomorrow,</b> i.e., in the future, <b>I will bring a claim</b> against <b>him in court, it is</b> a valid <b>protest.</b>
If the one lodging a protest also <b>said: Do not tell</b> the possessor of the protest, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Zevid said:</b> It is not a valid protest, because <b>isn’t he saying: Do not tell him?</b> Therefore, word of the protest will not reach the possessor and it is meaningless. <b>Rav Pappa</b> disagreed and <b>said</b> that the owner merely meant: <b>Do not tell him personally,</b> but they, i.e. the witnesses, should <b>tell others.</b> In that case, word of the protest will reach the possessor, since <b>your friend has a friend</b> whom he tells about the protest, <b>and your friend’s friend has a friend</b> whom he tells about the protest; therefore, it is a valid protest.
If the witnesses before whom the owner lodged the protest <b>said to him: We</b> are <b>not</b> going to <b>tell</b> the possessor about your protest, what is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Zevid said:</b> It is not a valid protest, and he has to lodge a protest before other witnesses, as are <b>they</b> not <b>saying to him: We are not</b> going to <b>tell him</b> about your protest? <b>Rav Pappa</b> disagreed and <b>said</b> that they merely meant: <b>We</b> are <b>not</b> going to <b>tell him personally,</b> but <b>we are</b> going to <b>tell others.</b> In that case, word of the protest will reach the possessor, since <b>your friend has a friend</b> whom he tells about the protest, <b>and your friend’s friend has a friend</b> whom he tells about the protest; therefore, it is a valid protest.
If the one lodging the protest also <b>said to them: A word [<i>shuta</i>] should not emerge from you</b> about this, what is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Zevid said:</b> It is not a valid protest, as <b>isn’t he saying</b> to them: <b>A word should not emerge</b> from you? Similarly, if the people before whom he protested <b>said to him: We will not</b> have <b>a word emerge</b> from us, <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is not a valid protest, as <b>aren’t they saying to him: We will not</b> have <b>a word emerge</b> from us? <b>Rav Huna, the son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> disagreed and <b>said:</b> It is a valid protest, because with regard to <b>any matter that</b> is <b>not</b> actually <b>incumbent on a person</b> to keep secret, it is likely that he will <b>say it</b> to others <b>unawares,</b> and therefore the presumption is that word will reach the possessor.
§ <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: A protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in</b> the <b>presence</b> of the possessor <b>is</b> a valid <b>protest. Rava raised an objection to</b> what <b>Rav Naḥman</b> said from the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The Sages <b>said</b> that establishing the presumption of ownership requires <b>three years only in order that</b> if the owner <b>will be in Spain and</b> another <b>possesses</b> his field for <b>a year,</b> people <b>will go and inform</b> the owner by the end of the next <b>year, and</b> the owner will <b>come</b> back <b>in</b> the <b>following year</b> and take the possessor to court. <b>And if</b> it <b>enters your mind</b> that <b>a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is</b> a valid <b>protest, why do I</b> need the owner <b>to come? Let him remain there in his place and protest.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> Rabbi Yehuda wishes to <b>teach us good advice, that he</b> should <b>come and collect the land and</b> its <b>produce.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From the fact</b> that <b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman, it may be inferred that</b> he does <b>not hold that a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is</b> a valid <b>protest. But doesn’t Rava say: A protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is</b> a valid <b>protest?</b> The Gemara answers: He <b>held that</b> conclusion only <b>after</b> he <b>heard this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>from Rav Naḥman.</b>
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, encountered</b> the <b>students of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and <b>said to them: Did Rabbi Yoḥanan say in</b> the presence of <b>how many</b> people <b>a protest</b> must be lodged? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> says: <b>A protest</b> must be lodged <b>in the presence of two</b> people. <b>Rabbi Abbahu said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said: <b>A protest</b> must be lodged <b>in the presence of three</b> people.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say that they disagree with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna? As Rabba bar Rav Huna says: Any matter that is said in the presence of three</b> people

Daf 39b

<b>is not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>malicious speech,</b> as it is already public knowledge. The Gemara elaborates on the suggestion that the dispute hinges upon this point: <b>The one who says</b> that a protest can be lodged <b>in the presence of two</b> people <b>is not of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna</b> and holds that even if only two people hear of a matter it will become a matter of public knowledge. Therefore, it is sufficient to protest in the presence of two witnesses. <b>And the one who says</b> that a protest must be lodged <b>in the presence of three</b> people <b>is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna.</b>
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, everyone is of</b> the opinion that the ruling is in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna, and here they disagree with regard to this: The one who says</b> that a protest can be lodged <b>in the presence of two</b> people <b>holds</b> that <b>a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is not</b> a valid <b>protest.</b> Therefore, two witnesses suffice, as they are needed to attest only to the fact that the owner protested. <b>And the one who says</b> that a protest must be lodged <b>in the presence of three</b> people <b>holds</b> that <b>a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is</b> a valid <b>protest.</b> Since the protest can be lodged not in the possessor’s presence, three people are needed to ensure that word of the protest will reach him.
<b>If you wish, say</b> instead <b>that everyone</b> holds that <b>a protest that</b> is lodged <b>not in his presence is</b> a valid <b>protest, and here they disagree with regard to this: The one who says</b> that a protest can be lodged <b>in the presence of</b> only <b>two</b> people <b>holds</b> that <b>we require testimony,</b> and two are sufficient for testimony. <b>And the one who says</b> that a protest must be lodged <b>in the presence of three</b> people <b>holds</b> that <b>we require</b> that <b>the matter</b> of the protest be <b>revealed,</b> and for that purpose three people are needed.
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Giddel bar Minyumi had a protest to lodge</b> with regard to his property. He <b>found Rav Huna and Ḥiyya bar Rav and Rav Ḥilkiya bar Tuvi, who were sitting, and</b> he <b>protested before them. After a year,</b> he <b>came</b> to them <b>again to protest. They said to him: You do not need</b> to do so; <b>this is what Rav says: Once</b> the owner <b>protested</b> in the <b>first year, he no longer needs to protest. And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Ḥiyya bar Rav said to him,</b> not in the name of Rav: <b>Once</b> the owner <b>protested</b> in the <b>first year,</b> he <b>no longer needs to protest.</b>
<b>Reish Lakish says in the name of bar Kappara: And</b> he <b>needs to protest at the end of each and every</b> period of <b>three</b> years, so that the possessor will not hold his property for three consecutive years uncontested. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan expressed surprise at this</b> ruling of Reish Lakish and said: <b>But does a robber have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership? Once the owner lodged one protest, he demonstrated that the possessor occupied his land unlawfully. Therefore, the possessor should never be able to establish the presumption of ownership. The Gemara clarifies: Does it <b>enter your mind</b> that the possessor is actually <b>a robber?</b> There is no evidence that he robbed, there is only a protest by the prior owner. <b>Rather,</b> emend his question as follows: Does one who is <b>akin to a robber have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership?
<b>Rava says</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is: The owner <b>needs to protest at the end of each and every</b> period of <b>three</b> years. <b>Bar Kappara teaches:</b> If the owner <b>protested, returned and protested,</b> and then <b>returned and protested, if,</b> when he <b>protested</b> the later times, his protest was <b>based on</b> the same claim as the <b>initial claim,</b> the possessor <b>has no presumptive ownership. But if</b> the later protests were <b>not</b> based on the same claim as the initial protest, the possessor <b>has presumptive ownership</b> since each time the owner advanced a new claim, he thereby nullified his earlier claims.
§ <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: A protest</b> can be lodged <b>in the presence of two</b> witnesses,

Daf 40a

<b>and</b> the prior owner <b>does not need to say</b> to the witnesses: <b>Write</b> a document detailing the protest; they can write one even absent a directive. Similarly, one who desires to state <b>a declaration,</b> preemptively invalidating a bill of sale by notifying the court that it was executed under duress, needs to state the declaration <b>in the presence of two</b> witnesses, <b>and</b> he <b>does not need to say</b> to them: <b>Write</b> a document detailing the declaration; they can write one even absent a directive.
The Gemara continues with the statement of Rava: <b>An admission</b> of a monetary obligation needs to be stated <b>in the presence of two</b> witnesses, <b>and</b> in this case, the one stating the admission <b>needs to say</b> to the witnesses: <b>Write</b> a document detailing the admission, as this document is to his detriment; they may not write one absent a directive. <b>Acquisition</b> by means of a symbolic act utilizing a cloth needs to be done <b>in the presence of two</b> witnesses, <b>and</b> the parties do <b>not need to say</b> to the witnesses: <b>Write</b> a document detailing the acquisition; they can write one even absent a directive. <b>And ratification of</b> legal <b>documents</b> needs to be done <b>by</b> means of <b>three</b> people.
The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the cases discussed above: <b><i>Mem</i>,</b> protest [<i>meḥa’a</i>]; <b><i>mem</i>,</b> declaration [<i>moda’a</i>]; <b><i>heh</i>,</b> admission [<i>hoda’a</i>]; <b><i>kuf</i>,</b> acquisition [<i>kinyan</i>].
Rava now discusses the statement of Rav Naḥman that he quoted. <b>Rava said: If</b> any part of this statement is <b>difficult to me, this</b> is what is <b>difficult to me. This acquisition, what is it like? If</b> it is <b>like an act of the court, it should require three</b> witnesses for it to take effect, as a court must consist of at least three men. <b>If</b> it is <b>not like an act of the court, why does he not have to say</b> to the witnesses that they should <b>write</b> the document detailing the acquisition? Isn’t transferring an item to another tantamount to admitting a monetary obligation?
<b>After</b> Rava <b>raised the dilemma,</b> he <b>then resolves it. Actually,</b> it is <b>not considered like an act of the court. And here, what is the reason that he does not have to say</b> to the witnesses that they should <b>write?</b> It is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> a record of <b>an unspecified acquisition</b> is <b>ready to</b> be <b>written.</b> A symbolic act of acquisition indicates one’s intention to do everything possible to finalize the transaction as soon as possible without waiting for the actual transfer of the item. Therefore, it is assumed that the parties would desire that a document be written, and no explicit authorization is necessary.
§ The Gemara discusses the <i>halakhot</i> of a preemptive declaration. <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both say: We write</b> a preemptive <b>declaration only concerning one who does not</b> generally <b>listen to</b> and implement <b>the judgment</b> of the court. In such a case, there is no recourse other than to write a preemptive declaration on behalf of the seller nullifying the transaction. If the buyer would be willing to listen to the court, the seller is expected to deal with the matter in court, rather than participating in the sale and writing a preemptive declaration. <b>Abaye and Rava both say:</b> A preemptive declaration may be written <b>even</b> concerning someone who is law abiding, such as <b>for me and for you,</b> as not every issue can be settled through the courts. The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: Any</b> preemptive <b>declaration</b>

Daf 40b

<b>that</b> does <b>not</b> have <b>written in it</b> the formulation: <b>We are aware of so-and-so’s duress,</b> i.e., we are aware of the nature of the coercion that forced him to enter this arrangement against his will, <b>is not</b> a valid preemptive <b>declaration.</b>
<b>For what</b> type of transaction is the preemptive <b>declaration</b> being stated? <b>If</b> one were to say that it is a preemptive declaration <b>for a bill of divorce or for a gift,</b> the preemptive declaration <b>is merely revealing the matter.</b> Since these actions can’t take place unless he desires it, it is sufficient that he stated that he does not desire them, and he need not specify a particular reason for nullifying them. <b>And if</b> it is <b>for a sale, but doesn’t Rava say: We do not write</b> a preemptive <b>declaration for a sale?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> it is referring to a preemptive declaration <b>for a sale,</b> as <b>Rava concedes</b> in a case <b>where one was compelled to act</b> due to a threat of monetary loss, <b>as with the incident of the orchard, as</b> there was <b>a certain man who mortgaged</b> his <b>orchard to another for three years. After he</b> worked and <b>profited</b> from <b>it</b> for the <b>three years</b> necessary <b>for</b> establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, <b>he said: If you sell</b> the orchard <b>to me,</b> it is <b>well. And if not,</b> then <b>I will hide</b> the <b>mortgage document and I will say</b> that this land <b>is purchased</b> and that is why it is <b>in my possession,</b> and you will receive no payment for the orchard. <b>In a case like this, we write</b> a preemptive <b>declaration.</b> The declaration states that he does not actually desire to sell his property but was forced to do so.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>this</b> document detailing <b>a concealed gift, we do not collect with it.</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>a concealed gift? Rav Yosef said:</b> It is referring to a case in <b>which</b> the giver <b>said to witnesses: Go</b> and <b>hide and write</b> a document <b>for</b> the recipient of this gift. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> It is referring to a case in <b>which</b> the giver <b>did not say to</b> witnesses: <b>Sit outdoors in the marketplace and write</b> it <b>for him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the two versions of Rav Yosef’s statement? The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between</b> the two versions is in a case where his instructions were <b>without specification,</b> i.e., he did not tell them to write the document in private or in public.
<b>Rava said: But</b> a concealed gift <b>is</b> effective as a preemptive <b>declaration for another</b> gift. In other words, if he first gave an item as a concealed gift to one person, and then he gave this item as a gift to someone else, the second gift is null and void. <b>Rav Pappa said: This</b> ruling <b>of Rava was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference,</b> and he did not, in fact, hold accordingly.
Rav Pappa explains the inference: <b>As</b> there was <b>a certain man who went to betroth a woman. She said to him: If you write</b> a document signing over <b>all of your property to me,</b> then <b>I will be your</b> wife, <b>and if not, I will not be your</b> wife. <b>He went</b> and <b>wrote</b> a document signing over <b>all of his property to her. His eldest son came</b> and <b>said to him: And that man,</b> i.e., me, <b>what will become of him</b> if you give all of your property to this woman? The father <b>said to</b> two <b>witnesses: Go hide in Avar Yemina and write</b> a document <b>for</b> the son, giving him the father’s property as a gift. Later, the witnesses <b>came before Rava.</b> He <b>said to them:</b> This <b>Master,</b> i.e., the son, <b>did not acquire</b> the property <b>and</b> that <b>Master,</b> i.e., the wife, <b>did not acquire</b> it either. The son did not acquire the property because it was a concealed gift.
The Gemara explains why the wife does not acquire it as well. <b>One who observed</b> this incident <b>assumed</b> that Rava invalidated the wife’s acquisition <b>because</b> the concealed gift to his son <b>was</b> a preemptive <b>declaration to the other</b> gift, <b>but</b> that <b>is not so. There,</b> in the case of the woman and the son, <b>the matter</b> is self-<b>evident that he wrote</b> a document signing over his property <b>to her because of duress,</b> as she had told him that she would not marry him otherwise; <b>but here,</b> in a typical case of giving one person a concealed gift and then giving a public gift to another, that is not the case. It is possible that it is simply <b>amenable to him that</b> this <b>Master,</b> i.e., the one to whom he gave it publicly, <b>should acquire</b> the gift, <b>and</b> it is <b>not amenable to him that</b> this <b>Master,</b> i.e., the one to whom he gave it privately, <b>should acquire</b> the gift. Consequently, an incorrect inference was drawn concerning Rava’s opinion.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages:

Daf 41a

<b>What</b> is the status of a document detailing a gift that is <b>with-out specification</b> as to whether the giver desired that it be publicized? <b>Ravina says: We are not concerned</b> that it may be a concealed gift, and <b>Rav Ashi says: We are concerned. And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>we are concerned.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Any possession that is not accompanied by a claim</b> explaining how the possessor became the owner <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>How so?</b> If the prior owner <b>said to</b> the possessor: <b>What are you doing in my</b> land? <b>And</b> the possessor <b>said to him</b> in response: I am in possession of the land <b>because no person ever said anything to me</b> about my being here, i.e., he states no valid claim as to why he would be the owner of the land, his mere use <b>is not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.
But if the possessor claimed: I am in possession of the land <b>because you sold</b> it <b>to me,</b> or: <b>Because you gave</b> it <b>to me as a gift,</b> or: Because <b>your father sold it to me,</b> or: Because <b>your father gave it to me as a gift,</b> these are valid claims to ownership. In these cases, his possession <b>is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>And one who comes</b> to claim the land <b>based on inheritance does not need a claim</b> explaining why his ancestors had a right to the land.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Why does the mishna need to say this? Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that one cannot establish the presumption of ownership absent a claim of ownership?
The Gemara answers: It is necessary for the mishna to state this, <b>lest you say: That man</b> had actually <b>purchased this land</b> that he possessed, <b>and he had a bill</b> of sale, <b>but it was lost. And the reason that he said</b> that he is in possession of the land because no person ever said anything to him, is that he <b>thought: If I say</b> that the prior owner <b>sold me this land,</b> the court will <b>say to me: Show</b> us <b>your bill</b> of sale. <b>Therefore,</b> being that this may be the case, <b>let us say to him: Perhaps you had a bill</b> of sale <b>and</b> it <b>was lost.</b> In a case <b>such as this,</b> one would think that <b>it is</b> a situation where the court should apply the verse: <b>“Open your mouth for the mute”</b> (Proverbs 31:8), meaning the court should advise a litigant of his possible claims, because perhaps he does not state them out of ignorance. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that the court does not advance this claim on his behalf, and if he does not make the claim of his own violation, he does not establish the presumption of ownership.
§ The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the discussion that follows: <b><i>Ayin</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>bet</i>.</b>
The Gemara tells of a related incident: <b>A torrent [<i>bideka</i>]</b> of water <b>swept</b> through <b>Rav Anan’s land,</b> removing the wall which marked the boundary between his land and that of his neighbor. Rav Anan <b>went back</b> and rebuilt <b>the wall,</b> inadvertently placing it <b>in his neighbor’s land.</b> Rav Anan <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> to ask him what he should do about it. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Go return</b> the boundary to its prior position.
Rav Anan replied: Why should I return the boundary? <b>But didn’t I</b> already <b>establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership of this land? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: In accordance with whose</b> opinion are you claiming a right to the land? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yishmael, who say: Any</b> taking of possession that is done <b>in the presence of</b> the prior owner <b>is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>immediately?</b> If so, your claim is not accepted since <b>the <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with their</b> opinion.
Rav Anan <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>But didn’t</b> the neighbor <b>waive</b> his ownership of this land, <b>as</b> he <b>came and assisted in</b> the building of <b>the wall with me?</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Anan: <b>It</b> is <b>an erroneous waiving,</b> since <b>you yourself would not</b> have placed the wall there <b>if you had known</b> that it was the wrong location for it. <b>Just as you did not know</b> that you were building it in the wrong location, <b>so too, he did not know.</b> Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that he did not knowingly waive his ownership of his property.
The Gemara relates a similar incident: <b>A torrent</b> of water <b>swept</b> through <b>Rav Kahana’s field,</b> removing the wall that marked the boundary between his land and that of his neighbor. Rav Kahana <b>went back</b> and rebuilt the <b>wall,</b> inadvertently placing it <b>in land that was not his.</b>

Daf 41b

Rav Kahana <b>came before Rav Yehuda.</b> Rav Kahana’s neighbor <b>went</b> and <b>brought two witnesses. One said:</b> Rav Kahana <b>entered two rows</b> into his neighbor’s land, <b>and one said:</b> Rav Kahana <b>entered three rows</b> into his neighbor’s land. Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana: <b>Go</b> and <b>pay two out of</b> the <b>three</b> that your neighbor is claiming by moving the wall two rows into your property.
Rav Kahana <b>said to</b> Rav Yehuda: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion are you ruling that the testimony of witnesses who contradict each other is valid? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar said: Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel did not disagree with regard to two sets of witnesses, where one</b> set <b>says</b> that a litigant owes <b>one hundred dinars and one</b> set <b>says</b> that he owes <b>two hundred.</b> In such a case, everyone agrees <b>that</b> two hundred <b>includes one hundred,</b> and he is liable to pay one hundred.
<b>With regard to what did</b> Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to one set</b> of witnesses, <b>where one</b> witness <b>says</b> that a litigant owes <b>one hundred dinars and one</b> witness <b>says</b> that he owes <b>two hundred; as</b> in such a case, <b>Beit Shammai say</b> that <b>their testimony is divided,</b> and they do not combine to form a set of witnesses, <b>and Beit Hillel say</b> that <b>two hundred includes one hundred,</b> and they combine to form a set of witnesses. Rav Kahana assumed that Rav Yehuda based his ruling on Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar’s interpretation of the opinion of Beit Hillel.
Rav Kahana then <b>said to</b> Rav Yehuda: How can you rely on this opinion? <b>But I can bring you a letter from the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, stating <b>that</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> and that in fact Beit Hillel also disqualify two witnesses in such a case. Rav Yehuda <b>said to</b> Rav Kahana: I will accept that ruling <b>when you will bring</b> such a letter. Until then, I stand by my ruling.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who resided in a loft in Kashta</b> for <b>four years.</b> At the end of that period, the prior <b>owner of the house came</b> and <b>found him</b> there. The prior owner <b>said to him: What do you want with this house</b> of mine? The possessor <b>said to</b> him: <b>I purchased it from so-and-so, who purchased it from you.</b> The possessor <b>came before Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who <b>said to him: If you have witnesses</b> who will testify <b>that he, from whom you purchased</b> the house, <b>resided in it, even</b> if there is testimony that he resided in it for only <b>one day, I will establish it in your possession, but if</b> there is <b>no</b> testimony to his having resided there then I will <b>not</b> establish it in your possession, and it will revert back to its prior owner.
<b>Rav said: I was sitting before my uncle [<i>deḥavivi</i>],</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya, <b>and I said to him: But isn’t it common</b> for <b>a person to purchase</b> a house <b>and sell</b> it immediately <b>during the</b> same <b>night?</b> It is possible that the seller purchased and sold the house without witnesses who saw him residing in it. <b>And I saw that</b> Rabbi Ḥiyya’s <b>opinion</b> was that <b>if</b> the possessor <b>said to</b> the claimant: The one who sold it to me <b>purchased it from you in my presence,</b> this claim is <b>deemed credible, since if</b> the possessor <b>wanted</b> to, he could have <b>said to</b> the prior owner of the house: <b>I purchased it from you.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> It <b>stands to reason</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya, as</b> the mishna (41a) <b>teaches:</b> In the case of land <b>that comes as an inheritance, one is not required to make a claim</b> as to how the land came into his benefactor’s possession when one’s ownership of the land is challenged. This indicates that <b>it is a claim that</b> he <b>does not need, but</b> he <b>does need proof</b> that it had been in the possession of his ancestors.
The Gemara rejects the inference from the mishna: <b>But perhaps</b> he <b>does not need proof and does not need a claim.</b> The only reason that the mishna mentions that he does not need a claim is to clarify that this does not fall into the category of a possession that is not accompanied by a claim. Therefore, one cannot infer from the ruling of that mishna what the <i>halakha</i> should be in this case. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that although the inference from the mishna is correct, it is not relevant to this case, as the case of <b>a buyer is different, since</b> he would <b>not throw money</b> away <b>for nothing.</b> The fact that he purchased the house indicates that he must have ascertained that the seller had a right to it.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If the seller <b>was seen in</b> the house, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is this sufficient proof that he had purchased the house? <b>Abaye said: It is identical</b> to testimony that he had resided there. <b>Rava said:</b> This does not constitute proof, as <b>a person is apt to survey [<i>desayyar</i>] land and</b> ultimately <b>not purchase</b> it.
§ The Gemara issues a ruling concerning the establishment of the presumption of ownership. <b>Three buyers combine</b> to establish the presumption of ownership. If one purchased a field and sold it to another, who then sold it to a third party, and in total, the three of them worked and profited from the field for three years, the third one has established the presumption of ownership. <b>Rav says: And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> only if they <b>all</b> purchased the land <b>with a bill</b> of sale. As a result of the bill of sale, the prior owner will know that it is not the case that each of them worked and profited from the field for only one year and abandoned it, which would explain why he did not bother to lodge a protest.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Rav holds</b> that <b>a bill</b> of sale generates <b>publicity, but witnesses do not</b> generate <b>publicity? But doesn’t Rav say</b> that with regard to <b>one who sells a field in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> and that field is later seized by the creditors of the seller, the buyer <b>collects from</b> the <b>liened property</b> that the seller had sold to others, to be reimbursed for his seized field? If not for the fact that the sale in the presence of witnesses generates publicity, those who later purchased land from the seller would not have been aware that the property they are purchasing is liened to the first buyer. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to <b>buyers,</b>

Daf 42a

<b>they caused their own loss</b> by not investigating whether there was a lien on the property that they intended to buy.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rav,</b> in fact, <b>say this,</b> that one can collect sold property by means of witnesses alone? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (175a): <b>One who lends money to another with</b> a promissory <b>note collects</b> his debt <b>from liened property</b> that had been sold after the loan, if the debtor has no other property; but if one lent <b>by means of witnesses</b> without a promissory note, he <b>collects</b> his debt only <b>from unsold property?</b>
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rav is a <i>tanna</i>, and</b> as such has the authority to <b>dispute</b> the determination in the mishna, <b>but didn’t Rav</b> himself <b>and Shmuel both say:</b> One who is owed a debt due to <b>a loan by oral</b> contract <b>does not collect</b> liened property, <b>not from the heirs</b> of the debtor <b>nor from the buyers,</b> despite the fact that there are witnesses?
The Gemara answers: <b>Are you raising a contradiction</b> from a case of <b>a loan to</b> a case of <b>a sale?</b> They are not comparable. In the case of <b>a loan, when</b> one <b>borrows</b> money he <b>borrows discreetly, in order that his property not be devalued,</b> as people will pay less for his property if they know that he is pressed for capital. Since a loan is issued discreetly, the presumption is that the buyers were unaware of the loan. Therefore, the creditor does not collect from sold property. By contrast, in the case of <b>a sale, one who sells land sells</b> it <b>in public in order that publicity be generated with regard to it.</b> Therefore, the cases of loans and sales are not comparable.
The Gemara continues the discussion of the establishment of the presumption of ownership by successive possessors. <b>The Sages taught:</b> If <b>the father</b> worked and <b>profited</b> from the land for one <b>year and the son</b> who inherited it from him worked and profited from it for <b>two</b> years, or if <b>the father</b> worked and profited from the land for <b>two</b> years <b>and the son</b> worked and profited from for one <b>year,</b> or if <b>the father</b> worked and profited from the land for one <b>year and the son</b> worked and profited from it for one <b>year, and the buyer,</b> who purchased it from the son, worked and profited from it for one <b>year, this is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> with regard to <b>a buyer,</b> the transaction generates <b>publicity? And</b> one can <b>raise a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:8): If one worked and <b>profited</b> from the land <b>in the presence of the father,</b> the prior owner, for one <b>year, and in the presence of the son,</b> who then inherited it from the father, for <b>two</b> years; or <b>in the presence of the father</b> for <b>two</b> years <b>and in the presence of the son</b> for one <b>year;</b> or <b>in the presence of the father</b> for one <b>year and in the presence of the son</b> for one <b>year and in the presence of the buyer,</b> who purchased it from the son, for one <b>year; this is</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that with regard to <b>a buyer,</b> the transaction generates <b>publicity, there is no greater protest than this.</b> By selling his land to someone else, the son of the prior owner is clearly stating that it does not belong to the possessor.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> That is not a contradiction, as <b>when that</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught,</b> it is taught <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>sells his fields without specification.</b> The son of the prior owner sold his fields without clarifying which fields he was selling. Since he did not specify the field from which the possessor is profiting, the possessor had no reason to assume that this field was being sold and that he needed to hold on to his deed, and he establishes the presumption of ownership despite the sale. In a case where the son of the prior owner stated explicitly that he was selling the field in question, the sale would serve as his protest.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Craftsmen</b> who are in possession of items that they are repairing, <b>and partners, and sharecroppers, and stewards [<i>veha’apotropin</i>] do not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership with regard to property in their possession, as their possession is not indicative of ownership. Similarly, <b>a man does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to his wife’s property, and a wife does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to her husband’s property. And a father</b> similarly <b>does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to a son’s property, and a son does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to a father’s property.</b> A husband and wife, or son and father, use each other’s property freely. Possession is therefore not indicative of ownership.
The mishna continues: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that one establishes the presumption of ownership after profiting from the property for a certain duration, with the exception of the above people, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>in</b> a case of one who <b>has</b> mere <b>possession</b> of the property, which does, in some cases, serve as proof of ownership. <b>But in</b> a case where another person <b>gives</b> one <b>a gift, or</b> there are <b>brothers who divided</b> their inheritance, <b>or</b> there is one who <b>takes possession of</b> the <b>property of a convert</b> who died without heirs and his property is now ownerless, as soon as one <b>locked</b> the door of the property, <b>or fenced</b> it <b>or breached</b> its fence even <b>a bit, this is</b> considered <b>taking possession</b> of the property, and it effects acquisition.

Daf 42b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Shmuel’s father and Levi taught: A partner does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership of property in his possession, <b>and, all the more so,</b> this inability applies to <b>a craftsman</b> as well. But <b>Shmuel teaches: A craftsman does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership of property in his possession, <b>but a partner</b> does <b>have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. The Gemara comments: <b>And Shmuel follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Shmuel says: Partners establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership with regard to the property of <b>each other, and</b> they <b>testify for each other and become paid bailees</b> of their joint property with regard <b>to each other.</b> In terms of these issues, Shmuel considers partners to be independent parties.
<b>Rabbi Abba raises a contradiction to Rav Yehuda in the cave of Rav Zakkai’s house: Did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say</b> that <b>a partner has</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership? <b>But doesn’t Shmuel say: A partner is</b> considered <b>as</b> one who <b>enters</b> the field <b>with permission,</b> such as a sharecropper? <b>Isn’t that to say that a partner does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership? The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult. This</b> is referring to <b>where</b> he <b>enters all of</b> the field, and <b>that</b> is referring to <b>where</b> he <b>enters half</b> of the field.
The Gemara explains: <b>Some say it in this manner and some say it in that manner.</b> On the one hand, it is possible to explain that if he entered half of the field he establishes the presumption of ownership with regard to that half, but if he entered the entire field he is merely acting as a partner. On the other hand, one could explain that entering half of the field does not establish the presumption of ownership at all, while entering the entire field does establish it.
<b>Ravina stated</b> a different resolution to the contradiction: <b>Both this and that</b> are referring to a case <b>where</b> he <b>enters the entire</b> field, <b>and</b> it is <b>not difficult. This</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the field <b>is of</b> sufficient area to be subject to the <b><i>halakha</i> of division.</b> In this case, his being in possession of the other half of the field as well, which belonged to his partner, establishes the presumption of ownership. <b>That</b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the field <b>is not of</b> sufficient area to be subject to the <b><i>halakha</i> of division.</b> Since the property will not be divided but will remain co-owned, he is merely possessing it as a partner and does not establish the presumption of ownership.
§ The Gemara addresses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Shmuel says: A partner is</b> considered <b>as</b> one who <b>enters</b> the field <b>with permission. What is</b> this <b>teaching us,</b> that <b>there is no</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership in the context of <b>partnership?</b> If so, <b>let</b> him <b>say</b> explicitly: <b>A partner does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership of property in his possession.
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> Shmuel’s intent was <b>to state that</b> a partner who proactively works to improve their mutual property <b>collects</b> the <b>enhancement that reaches shoulders,</b> i.e., when the produce that grew due to the efforts of the partner is fully grown and ripened and can be harvested and carried upon one’s shoulders. He is not considered as one who entered another’s field without permission and improved it, who collects only for his expenditures. This is the <i>halakha</i> if he planted trees <b>in a field that is not commonly used for planting</b> trees, <b>just as</b> it is if he planted <b>in a field that is commonly used for planting</b> trees.
The Gemara continues its discussion of Shmuel’s statement: <b>And testify for each other.</b> A partner may join another witness in testifying with regard to the fact that his partner owns a share of their field in order to counter the claim of a one who claims ownership of the field, and his testimony is not disqualified due to being biased.

Daf 43a

The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> is this so? Aren’t partners <b>biased in their testimony,</b> as they jointly own the property in question?
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the partner who is testifying <b>wrote to</b> the other partner: <b>I do not have</b> any <b>legal</b> dealings <b>or involvement with regard to this field, thereby</b> relinquishing his ownership of the field. The Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> he <b>wrote</b> this <b>to him, what of it? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>one who says to another: I do not have</b> any <b>legal</b> dealings <b>or involvement concerning this field, or: I have no dealings with it, or: My hands are removed from it, has said nothing?</b> That is to say, these statements have no legal standing.
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the one testifying <b>performed</b> an act of <b>acquisition with</b> the other partner. Since relinquishing his share in this fashion is effective, his testimony is no longer biased. The Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> he <b>performed</b> an act of <b>acquisition with</b> the one testifying, <b>what of it?</b> His testimony is still biased, as he is <b>establishing</b> the field <b>before his creditor.</b> Once he transferred his share to his partner, his creditor will now be able to collect from the property that he formerly co-owned, as a creditor can collect from property that a debtor once owned despite the fact that he has relinquished his ownership of it. Since his testimony enables him to repay his debt, it is biased.
<b>As Ravin bar Shmuel says in the name of Shmuel: One who sells a field to another</b> even <b>without a guarantee</b> that if the field will be repossessed the seller will compensate the buyer for his loss <b>cannot testify with regard to</b> ownership of that field <b>on behalf of</b> the buyer <b>because</b> he is <b>establishing</b> the field <b>before his creditor.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the one testifying <b>assumes</b> financial <b>responsibility for</b> the field. Therefore, his testimony is not biased. The Gemara clarifies: <b>Responsibility with regard to whom? If we say</b> that he assumes <b>general responsibility,</b> such that if anyone collects the field from his former partner for whatever reason, he is liable to compensate the partner, then <b>all the more so</b> it is <b>preferable for him</b> that the field remain in his former partner’s possession, as if the claimant will be successful in obtaining the field, the witness will have to compensate the partner. <b>Rather,</b> it is referring to a case where he assumes <b>responsibility</b> only <b>for</b> a loss <b>that comes to</b> his former partner in the property <b>resulting from</b> the field being seized by one of his creditors to collect payment for <b>his</b> debts. He is, therefore, not an interested party, as in any event he owes the same debt, either to his creditor or to his partner.
The Gemara asks: <b>And if he removes himself from</b> the property by having the former partner acquire his share in it, <b>is</b> it actually effective to <b>remove</b> him, so that there is no longer a concern for biased testimony? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a case of <b>residents of a city whose Torah scroll was stolen,</b> the case is <b>not adjudicated by</b> the <b>judges of that city, and proof may not be brought from</b> the testimony of the <b>people of that city,</b> as their testimony is biased? <b>And if it is so</b> that relinquishing one’s share renders one as not biased, then <b>let two of them remove themselves from</b> their share in the Torah scroll, <b>and</b> then the court can <b>judge</b> the case based on their testimony.
The Gemara answers: <b>A Torah scroll is different, as it stands for</b> the people <b>to listen</b> to the Torah reading from it. Since they are obligated to listen to the Torah reading, they stand to benefit from this Torah scroll even if they relinquish their ownership share in it, and their testimony is biased.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says: Give one hundred dinars to the residents of my city,</b> the distribution of the funds is <b>not adjudicated by</b> the <b>judges of that city, and proof may not be brought from</b> the testimony of the <b>people of that city,</b> as their testimony is biased. <b>Why</b> not? <b>Let two</b> people <b>remove themselves</b> from their share in the funds <b>and</b> then the court can <b>judge</b> the case based on their testimony.
The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> this <i>halakha</i> is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case where the gift was for the purpose of procuring <b>a Torah scroll,</b> and the same aforementioned reasoning applies.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says: Give one hundred dinars to the poor</b> people <b>of my city,</b> the distribution of the funds is <b>not adjudicated by</b> the <b>judges of that city, and proof may not be brought from</b> testimony of the <b>people of that city,</b> as their testimony is biased. <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> the fact that the <b>poor take</b> the money and the <b>judges are</b> thereby <b>disqualified</b> as interested parties? <b>Rather, say:</b> The distribution of the funds is <b>not adjudicated by</b> the <b>poor judges of that city, and proof may not be brought from</b> the testimony of the <b>poor people of that city. And why</b> not? <b>Let two</b> people <b>remove themselves</b> from their share in the funds <b>and</b> then the court can <b>judge</b> the case based on their testimony.
The Gemara answers: <b>Here, too</b> this <i>halakha</i> is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case where the gift was for the purpose of procuring <b>a Torah scroll,</b> and the same aforementioned reasoning applies. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> if it is referring to money for purchasing a Torah scroll rather than money earmarked for charity, <b>why</b> does the <i>baraita</i> <b>call</b> the recipients: <b>Poor</b> people? <b>Because everyone is poor with regard to a Torah scroll,</b> as it is very expensive.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> it is referring to people who are <b>literally poor, as it teaches. And</b> the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to poor people, whose</b> support is <b>incumbent upon</b> all of the residents. Therefore, a gift to these poor people reduces their obligation, and all of their testimony is biased. The Gemara clarifies: <b>And what are the circumstances</b> in which this <i>baraita</i> states its ruling? <b>If</b> it is a place <b>where</b> the sum of charity that each resident is obligated to give is <b>fixed for them, let two of</b> them <b>give what is fixed for them</b> to give to the poor, <b>and</b> then the court can <b>judge</b> the case based on their testimony.
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the sum is <b>not fixed for them.</b> Therefore, this is not an option. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually,</b> it is referring to a place <b>where</b> the sum is <b>fixed for them. And</b> nevertheless, it is <b>amenable to</b> the residents of the city that the poor receive a gift, <b>because once</b> there is <b>a gain</b> for the poor people from this donation, there is <b>a gain,</b> and it lightens the burden on all of the people of the city.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss Shmuel’s statement concerning partners: <b>And they become paid bailees</b> of their joint property with regard to <b>each other.</b>

Daf 43b

The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> are they liable as paid bailees? Isn’t <b>it</b> a case of <b>safeguarding accompanied by</b> employment of the <b>owner?</b> Since both partners are safeguarding each other’s property, they are both employed by each other, and they should therefore be exempt from the obligations of safeguarding. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Shmuel is referring to a case <b>where he says to</b> his partner: <b>Safeguard for me today, and I will safeguard for you tomorrow.</b> In this circumstance, they are each the sole bailee at any given moment, and they do not receive the exemption from bailee payments for being employed by the owner.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> If one <b>sold a house to</b> another, or if he <b>sold a field to him,</b> he <b>cannot testify about it for</b> the buyer against a claimant <b>because</b> the financial <b>responsibility</b> to compensate the buyer <b>for it</b> is <b>upon him,</b> and his testimony is biased. By contrast, if he <b>sold a cow to him,</b> or if he <b>sold a cloak to him,</b> he <b>can testify about it for</b> the buyer <b>because</b> the financial <b>responsibility</b> to compensate the buyer <b>for it</b> is <b>not upon him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause</b> that he cannot testify <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> that he can? Why would one assume that in the first case he does bear responsibility, but not in the second?
<b>Rav Sheshet said: The first clause</b> is stated <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>Reuven, who robbed Shimon of a field and sold it to Levi, and</b> then <b>Yehuda comes and contests</b> Levi’s ownership, stating that it was actually his. The <i>baraita</i> teaches <b>that Shimon cannot go</b> to court <b>to testify for Levi, because</b> it is <b>preferable for</b> Shimon <b>that</b> the field be <b>returned</b> to Levi, so that he can later collect it from him.
The Gemara asks: <b>But once</b> he <b>testified that</b> the field <b>is Levi’s, how is he able to</b> later <b>remove it from his</b> possession? The Gemara answers: This is referring to a case <b>where</b> Shimon <b>says</b> in his testimony: <b>I know that this land is not Yehuda’s,</b> but he did not explicitly testify that it belonged to Levi. He is therefore able to later claim it is his and not Levi’s. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why should he testify that it does not belong to Yehuda? <b>With that</b> same <b>right</b> by which he <b>removes</b> the land <b>from</b> the possession of <b>Levi, let him remove it from</b> the possession of <b>Yehuda.</b> It is not to his advantage to lie in order to establish it in the possession of Levi, and his testimony should not be considered biased.
The Gemara answers: <b>Because</b> Shimon <b>says</b> to himself: <b>The second</b> person <b>is amenable to me,</b> while <b>the first</b> is <b>more difficult than he</b> is, i.e., I prefer to litigate with Levi rather than with Yehuda.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: It is referring to a case <b>where</b> this <b>Master,</b> Shimon, <b>has witnesses</b> attesting to his ownership, <b>and</b> that <b>Master,</b> Yehuda, also <b>has witnesses</b> attesting to his ownership, <b>and the Sages said</b> that under such circumstances <b>the land should remain where it is.</b> That is to say, it should remain with the one currently in possession. If Yehuda were to be awarded the land, Shimon would not be able to remove the land from his possession despite having witnesses to support his claim, as Yehuda also has witnesses supporting his claim and would be in possession of the land. As a result of Shimon’s testimony, the land will be awarded to Levi, who has possession as a result of his purchase from Reuven. Then Shimon will be able to remove the land from Levi’s possession by proving that Reuven stole it from him. Therefore, Shimon’s testimony is biased.

Daf 44a

The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to the understanding of Rav Sheshet, that the <i>baraita</i> is disqualifying one whose field was stolen from testifying on behalf of one who purchased the field from the robber, why is it necessary to discuss a case involving a buyer, when it would be simpler to <b>establish it with regard to</b> testifying for the <b>robber</b> himself?
The Gemara answers: The <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> discusses a case involving a buyer <b>because</b> he <b>wants to teach the latter clause:</b> If he <b>sold a cow to him,</b> or if he <b>sold a cloak to him,</b> he can testify about it for the buyer. <b>As</b> in this clause, the <i>tanna</i> <b>specifically</b> needs to discuss a case where the robber <b>sold</b> it, <b>because</b> then <b>it is</b> a case of <b>despair</b> by the owners due to the robbery, <b>and</b> there is also <b>a change in possession</b> due to the sale, and the one who was robbed can no longer reclaim the stolen item. He is therefore no longer biased in his testimony and can testify for the one who purchased the item. <b>But</b> in the latter clause, if the robber did <b>not sell</b> it, in which case the stolen item <b>is returned to</b> the robbery victim, he <b>cannot</b> testify, as he prefers that the item be in the possession of the robber, so that he can recover it from him. Therefore, the <i>tanna</i> <b>taught</b> in <b>the first clause as well</b> about a case where he <b>sold</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>the latter clause as well,</b> where there is despair and change in possession, <b>granted that</b> he <b>despairs of</b> recovering the item <b>itself,</b> but <b>did</b> he <b>despair of</b> being reimbursed for <b>its value?</b> While it is true that he lost his ownership of the item, he is still entitled to payment. Therefore, he is still biased in his testimony. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where the robber died,</b> in which case the robbery victim cannot collect even the value of the stolen item, and is no longer biased in his testimony. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 111b): In the case of <b>one who robs</b> another of food <b>and feeds</b> it to <b>his</b> own <b>children, or</b> who <b>left</b> a stolen item <b>to them</b> as an inheritance, the children <b>are exempt from paying</b> the victim of the robbery after their father’s death. Since he is no longer able to collect the value of the stolen item, he is not biased in his testimony and can testify on behalf of the buyer.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>establish</b> the entire <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> testifying for the robber’s <b>heir?</b> This would demonstrate the contrast that the <i>tanna</i> wanted to teach. In the case of a stolen field, which always must be returned to its owner, the robbery victim is biased in his testimony because the field can be recovered. Therefore, it is in his interest to establish that it is in the possession of the robber’s heirs. In the case of movable property, which cannot be recovered after the death of the robber, he is not biased in his testimony.
The Gemara notes: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that the transfer of an item to the <b>possession</b> of <b>an heir</b> is <b>not like</b> the transfer of an item to the <b>possession</b> of <b>a buyer,</b> but is viewed as an extension of the possession of the legator. According to this opinion, it is <b>well</b> that the <i>baraita</i> did not establish its case with regard to the robber’s heir, as the robbery victim would be able to recover the item, and would be considered biased in his testimony. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that the transfer of an item to the <b>possession</b> of <b>an heir</b> is <b>like</b> the transfer of an item to the <b>possession</b> of <b>a buyer,</b> and the item is not recoverable in either case, <b>what can be said</b> to explain why the <i>baraita</i> does not state its case with regard to an heir?
<b>And furthermore,</b> this explanation was <b>difficult for Abaye</b> to understand, as according to Rav Sheshet’s explanation, is it accurate to state, as the <i>baraita</i> does, that the distinction exists between the cases of land and movable property <b>because</b> in the first clause the financial <b>responsibility</b> to compensate the buyer <b>for</b> the land is <b>upon him, and</b> in the latter clause the financial <b>responsibility</b> to compensate the buyer <b>for</b> the movable property is <b>not upon him?</b> That is not the crucial distinction. The <i>tanna</i> <b>should have</b> taught instead that the difference is: Here he cannot testify <b>because</b> the stolen field <b>returns to him, and</b> here he can testify because the stolen item <b>does not return to him.</b>
The Gemara offers a new explanation of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rather,</b> explain instead <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Ravin bar Shmuel, as Ravin bar Shmuel says in the name of Shmuel: One who sells a field to another</b> even <b>without a guarantee</b> that if the field will be repossessed the seller will compensate the buyer for his loss <b>cannot testify with regard to</b> ownership of that field <b>on behalf of</b> the buyer, <b>because</b> he is <b>establishing</b> the field <b>before his creditor.</b>
The Gemara clarifies this by noting: <b>And</b> this is the case <b>specifically</b> in the case of <b>a house or a field. But</b> in the case of <b>a cow or a cloak,</b> he is not biased in his testimony, and can testify on behalf of the buyer. The Gemara explains: <b>It is not necessary</b> to say that this is the <i>halakha</i>

Daf 44b

<b>in</b> a case where he sold a cow or cloak <b>without specification, where it is not liened to</b> the creditor. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is because these items <b>are movable property, and movable property is not liened to a creditor. And even though</b> it is so <b>that</b> the debtor <b>wrote to</b> the creditor that he can collect the debt even <b>from</b> the <b>cloak that is on his shoulders, that matter</b> applies only <b>when it is as is</b> and in the possession of the debtor, <b>but</b> if <b>it is not as is,</b> since it is in the possession of the buyer, then <b>no,</b> the creditor cannot collect from movable property. Therefore, the debtor can testify on behalf of the buyer.
The Gemara continues: <b>But even</b> in a case where he <b>set</b> the cow or cloak <b>aside</b> as <b>designated repayment [<i>apoteiki</i>],</b> the creditor <b>cannot</b> collect from it. <b>What is the reasoning?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rava, as Rava says:</b> If a master <b>set aside his slave</b> as <b>designated repayment</b> of a debt <b>and</b> then <b>sold him,</b> the master’s <b>creditor collects</b> the debt <b>from</b> the proceeds from the sale of the slave. But if one set aside <b>his ox or his donkey</b> as <b>designated repayment and</b> then <b>sold it,</b> the <b>creditor does not collect</b> the debt <b>from</b> the proceeds of the sale of the ox or the donkey.
<b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? <b>This</b> setting aside of the slave as designated repayment generates <b>publicity, and that</b> setting aside of the ox or donkey as designated repayment does <b>not</b> generate <b>publicity.</b> Therefore, when the slave had been set aside as designated repayment, the buyer would have been aware of this. Since he bought the slave while having this knowledge, the slave can be seized from him by the seller’s creditor. By contrast, the buyer of the cow or cloak would not have been aware that it had been set aside as designated repayment, so the seller’s creditor cannot seize it from him.
The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> there be <b>a concern</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the debtor <b>transferred</b> the <b>movable property to</b> the creditor, not for him to own, but for him to have a lien on the movable property, <b>by means of,</b> i.e., together with, an acquisition of <b>land, as Rabba said: If</b> the debtor <b>transferred movable property to</b> the creditor as liened property <b>by means of</b> an acquisition of <b>land,</b> the creditor <b>acquires the land</b> and <b>acquires</b> the <b>movable property,</b> i.e., a lien is created with regard to both. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: And that is</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>where</b> the debtor <b>wrote to</b> the creditor: This lien is <b>not like a transaction with inconclusive consent [<i>ke’asmakhta</i>],</b> which does not effect acquisition, <b>and not like the template [<i>ketofesa</i>] for documents,</b> which are not actually used to collect debts. Rather, it is a legally binding document.
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where</b> the debtor had <b>purchased</b> the movable property <b>and immediately sold</b> it, and there was no opportunity for him to have it become liened to a creditor. Therefore, there is no possibility of his being biased in his testimony due to a desire to repay his debt.
The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> there be <b>a concern</b> that <b>perhaps it is</b> a case in which the debtor wrote to the creditor: I will repay you even from <b>that</b> which <b>I will acquire</b> in the future, which would presumably mean that the creditor can collect from the buyer even though the debtor purchased the item after taking the loan. From the fact that this is not a concern, do <b>you learn from it</b> that even if the debtor wrote: I will repay you even from that which <b>I will acquire</b> in the future, and he then <b>purchased and sold</b> property or <b>purchased and bequeathed</b> it, that which he purchases is <b>not liened</b> to his creditor? This would seem to settle what is otherwise assumed to be an unresolved question.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No,</b> one need not reach that conclusion, as it is <b>necessary</b> to teach the <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where witnesses say: We know about this</b> one who sold these items <b>that he never had</b> any <b>land.</b> Therefore, it cannot be that the creditor acquired a lien on the movable property by means of an acquisition of land.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rav Pappa say</b> that <b>even though the Sages said:</b> In the case of <b>one who sells a field to another without a guarantee, and a creditor came and repossessed it,</b> the buyer <b>cannot return to</b> the seller, i.e. the debtor, who sold him the field, to claim reimbursement; but if it is <b>found that</b> the field <b>was not</b> the seller’s in the first place, the buyer can <b>return to</b> the seller to claim reimbursement. In this case, if the claimant establishes that the cow or cloak is his and was not the seller’s, the buyer will be able to claim reimbursement. The seller is therefore biased in his testimony, and should not be able to testify on behalf of the buyer.
The Gemara answers: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with</b> a case where the buyer admits that he <b>recognizes that this</b> is the <b>offspring of</b> the seller’s <b>donkey,</b> and will not claim in court that the seller had no right to sell it.
The Gemara returns to the statement of Rav Pappa and comments: <b>But</b> in contrast to the opinion of Rav Pappa, <b>Rav Zevid says: Even</b> if it is <b>found that</b> the field <b>was not</b> the seller’s, the buyer <b>cannot return to</b> the seller to claim reimbursement, <b>as</b> the seller can <b>say to</b> the buyer: It is <b>for this</b> reason that <b>I sold it to you without a guarantee,</b> i.e., so that if it is taken from you, I will not bear liability.
§ The Gemara returns to Shmuel’s statement, in order to examine <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Ravin bar Shmuel says in the name of Shmuel: One who sells a field to another</b> even <b>without a guarantee</b> that if the field will be repossessed the seller will compensate the buyer for his loss <b>cannot testify with regard to</b> ownership of that field <b>on behalf of</b> the buyer, <b>because</b> he is <b>establishing</b> the field <b>before his creditor.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of this <i>halakha</i>?

Daf 45a

<b>If</b> this is a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>has other land,</b> that he did not sell, in addition to the field that he sold with regard to which he currently wishes to testify, his creditor will <b>go after it,</b> and collect from that land. In that case, he is not biased in his testimony concerning the field that he sold. <b>If</b> this is a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>does not have other land, what difference does it make to him</b> if the buyer is unable to keep the land? In any event the creditor cannot collect directly from the seller.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> Shmuel is referring to a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>does not have other land,</b> and the reason that he is nevertheless biased in his testimony is that he wants his creditors to be able to collect the debt <b>because he says</b> to himself that it is <b>uncomfortable for him to be</b> in the category of: <b>“The wicked borrows, and pays not”</b> (Psalms 37:21).
The Gemara asks: But <b>ultimately, he is also</b> in the category of: <b>“The wicked borrows, and pays not”</b> (Psalms 37:21) <b>with regard to the other</b> one, to whom he sold the land. He took money from the buyer, who did not receive anything in exchange, as the land was seized from him. The Gemara answers: He is not concerned about his behavior toward the buyer, <b>as</b> he can <b>say</b> to him: <b>For this</b> very reason <b>I sold it to you without a guarantee,</b> so that if it would be seized from you I would not be liable.
§ The Gemara relates: <b>Rava announced, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Pappa</b> who announced: All <b>those who ascend</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael <b>and</b> all <b>those who descend</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia should be aware of the following: In a case of <b>this Jew who sold a donkey to another Jew, and</b> then <b>a gentile came and seized it from him,</b> claiming that it was really his, <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>that</b> the seller should <b>rescue [<i>dimfatzei</i>] it from</b> the gentile or reimburse the buyer.
The Gemara points out: <b>And we said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case where the buyer <b>does not recognize that this is</b> the <b>offspring of</b> the seller’s <b>donkey,</b> and it is possible that the gentile’s claim is true. <b>But</b> if the buyer <b>recognizes that this is</b> the <b>offspring of</b> the seller’s <b>donkey,</b> then the seller is <b>not</b> liable to reimburse him. It is clear that the gentile’s claim is false, so the seller bears no responsibility for the buyer’s loss. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>we said</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case where the gentile did <b>not seize it and the saddle</b> with it. <b>But</b> if he <b>seized it and the saddle</b> with it, it is clear that the gentile is a robber, and it is assumed that there is no validity to his claim with regard to the donkey. Therefore, the seller is <b>not</b> liable to reimburse him.
<b>Ameimar said: Even if there are not any of these</b> factors, the seller is <b>not</b> liable to reimburse him. <b>What is the reasoning</b> for this? It is that <b>it is known that an ordinary gentile is an extortionist,</b> so it is assumed that the donkey did indeed belong to the seller, <b>as it is stated: “Whose mouth speaks falsehood, and their right hand is a right hand of lying”</b> (Psalms 144:8).
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the statement of Shmuel (42b): <b>A craftsman does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership of the property in his possession, but a partner has the ability to establish the presumption of ownership. <b>Rabba says: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>transferred</b> the item <b>to</b> the craftsman <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses. But</b> if the owner <b>transferred</b> the item <b>to</b> the craftsman <b>not in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> then, <b>since</b> the craftsman <b>is able to say to</b> the one who claims to be the owner: <b>These matters never occurred,</b> i.e., you did not give me this item but it was mine to begin with, and he would keep possession of the item with that claim, then <b>even when</b> the craftsman <b>says to him: It is purchased</b> by me from you, and that is why it is <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>deemed credible.</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rabba: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even</b> if the owner transferred the item to the craftsman <b>in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses as well,</b> he should be deemed credible. <b>Since</b> the craftsman <b>is able to say to</b> the owner: <b>I returned</b> the item <b>to you,</b> and he would be exempt from payment, <b>when</b> the craftsman <b>says to him: It is purchased</b> by me from you, and that is why it is <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>deemed credible.</b>
<b>Rabba said to</b> Abaye: <b>Do you maintain</b> that

Daf 45b

in the case of <b>one who deposits</b> an item <b>with another in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses</b> the recipient <b>need not return</b> it <b>to him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses?</b> If that were to be so, the craftsman could claim that he had returned it to the owner, even though there are no witnesses. That possibility should <b>not enter your mind. Rather,</b> in the case of <b>one who deposits</b> an item <b>with another in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> the recipient <b>must return</b> it <b>to him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses.</b> Therefore, the craftsman could not have claimed that he returned it to the owner.
<b>Abaye raises an objection</b> to Rabba’s ruling from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 2:6): There is a case where one <b>saw his slave in</b> the <b>possession of a craftsman, or his cloak in</b> the <b>possession of a launderer,</b> and <b>says to him: What</b> is the <b>nature of its</b> presence <b>in your</b> possession? If the craftsman or launderer replied: <b>You sold me</b> the slave or cloak, or: <b>You gave</b> the slave or cloak <b>to me as a gift,</b> he has <b>not said anything,</b> and must return it, since a craftsman does not establish the presumption of ownership. But if the craftsman or launderer replied: <b>You said in my presence to</b> someone else <b>to sell</b> the slave or cloak to him <b>or to give</b> the slave or cloak <b>to him,</b> i.e., to sell or give the slave or cloak to the craftsman or launderer himself, <b>as a gift,</b> then <b>his statement is valid.</b>
Before Abaya raises his objection, he first clarifies the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause</b> that the craftsman is not deemed credible <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> that he is?
<b>Rabba said: The latter clause</b> is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case where the slave or cloak <b>emerges from the possession of another,</b> and not from the possession of the craftsman, <b>and</b> this <b>other</b> person <b>is saying to</b> the owner: <b>You said in my presence to</b> the craftsman <b>to sell</b> the slave or cloak <b>or to give</b> the slave or cloak to me <b>as gift.</b> This person is deemed credible despite acknowledging that he received it from the craftsman, <b>since if he had wanted</b> to, he could have <b>said to</b> the owner of the item: <b>I purchased</b> the slave or cloak <b>from you.</b> As this third party is not a craftsman, he is able to establish the presumption of ownership through possession and would be deemed credible. Therefore, <b>when</b> he <b>says to him as well: You said to him in my presence to sell</b> the slave or cloak, <b>his statement is valid, and he is</b> also <b>deemed credible.</b>
After having clarified the ruling of the <i>baraita</i>, Abaye presents his objection: <b>In any event, the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that the case where a craftsman is not deemed credible is where the owner <b>saw</b> the slave or cloak in the possession of the craftsman. <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> it is referring to <b>where there are witnesses</b> to the fact that the owner gave the slave or cloak to the craftsman for training or cleaning, respectively, <b>why do I</b> need for the owner to have <b>seen</b> them in the craftsman’s possession? Let the owner simply <b>bring witnesses and take</b> back his slave or cloak. <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where there are no witnesses, and</b> nevertheless, <b>when</b> the owner <b>saw</b> the slave or cloak in the craftsman’s possession, he <b>may seize</b> the slave or cloak <b>in any case?</b> This contradicts Rabba’s statement that the decisive factor is whether the transfer took place in the presence of witnesses.
Rabba answers this objection: <b>No,</b> that is not the case of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Actually,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where there are witnesses, and</b> nevertheless, <b>that is</b> the <i>halakha</i>, that he may seize the slave or cloak only <b>where</b> he <b>saw</b> it currently in the possession of the craftsman. But if there are no witnesses that it is currently in his possession, he would be deemed credible if he were to claim that he purchased the slave or cloak from the owner, as he could have claimed that he returned the slave or cloak.
Abaye asked him: <b>But you are</b> the one <b>who said:</b> In the case of <b>one who deposits</b> an item <b>with another in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> the recipient <b>must return</b> it <b>to him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses.</b> Therefore, if it was given to the craftsman in the presence of witnesses, he would not have the ability to make a more advantageous claim [<i>miggo</i>] that he returned it. Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>I retracted</b> that opinion and hold that he may return it even when not in the presence of witnesses.
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> <b>to support</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba:</b> With regard to <b>one who gives his cloak to a craftsman,</b> and then the <b>craftsman says: You fixed two</b> dinars as <b>my</b> payment, <b>and that one,</b> the owner, <b>says: I fixed</b> only <b>one</b> dinar as <b>your</b> payment, then, <b>so long as</b> it is so <b>that the cloak is in</b> the <b>possession of</b> the <b>craftsman,</b> it is incumbent <b>upon</b> the <b>owner to bring proof</b> that the fee was one dinar. If the craftsman <b>gave</b> the cloak back <b>to him,</b> then there are two scenarios: If the claim is lodged <b>in its</b> proper <b>time,</b> i.e., on the day of the cloak’s return, then the craftsman <b>takes an oath and receives</b> the two dinars. <b>But</b> if <b>its</b> proper <b>time passed,</b> then <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> and the craftsman would need to bring proof that the fee was two dinars.
Rava continues with an analysis of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case discussed in this <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> it is a case <b>where there are witnesses</b> who saw the transfer of the item, <b>let us see what the witnesses say</b> about the fee, as they presumably heard the details of the arrangement.

Daf 46a

<b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where there are no witnesses</b> to the transfer, <b>and</b> it <b>teaches</b> that the <b>craftsman</b> is <b>deemed credible? Since if he had wanted</b> to he could have <b>said to him: It is purchased</b> and that is why it is <b>in my possession,</b> he is <b>deemed credible with regard to</b> his claim <b>about his fee as well.</b> This supports the ruling of Rabba that if there are no witnesses, the craftsman is deemed credible if he says that the item belongs to him.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No, actually,</b> perhaps the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where there are no witnesses</b> to the transfer, <b>but</b> it is specifically referring to a case <b>where</b> the owner <b>did not see</b> the cloak in the possession of the craftsman, who could consequently deny ever having received it from the owner. Therefore, it is not a proof in support of the ruling of Rabba that the craftsman would be deemed credible even if there are witnesses that it is currently in his possession.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak raises an objection</b> to Rabba’s ruling from Shmuel’s paraphrase of the mishna: <b>A craftsman does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership of property in his possession. This indicates that <b>it is</b> specifically <b>a craftsman who does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, <b>but another</b> person in similar circumstances <b>has</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.
<b>What are the circumstances</b> in which this would apply? <b>If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where there are witnesses</b> that the person in question received the item from another, <b>why</b> is it that <b>another</b> person <b>has</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, when there are witnesses that he received this item as a deposit? <b>Rather, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where there are no witnesses, and</b> yet, the mishna <b>teaches: A craftsman does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. This indicates that a craftsman does not establish the presumption of ownership under any circumstances, contrary to the ruling of Rabba. The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation of</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba</b> is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation,</b> and his ruling is rejected.
§ The Gemara discusses another <i>halakha</i> pertaining to the giving of an item to a craftsman. <b>The Sages taught:</b> If one’s <b>utensils were</b> mistakenly <b>switched with</b> another’s <b>utensils in the house of a craftsman, this</b> one who received the wrong utensils <b>may use them until</b> the time <b>when that</b> one, whose utensils he received, <b>comes and takes his.</b> But if his utensils and another’s utensils were mistakenly switched <b>in a house of mourning or in a house of</b> a wedding <b>feast, this</b> one who took the wrong utensils <b>may not use them</b> in the interim, i.e., <b>until</b> the time <b>when that</b> one, whose utensils he took, <b>comes and takes his.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause</b> where he may use the utensils, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause</b> where he may not?
<b>Rav said: I was sitting before my uncle,</b> Rav Ḥiyya, <b>and he said</b> the explanation <b>to me: And is a person not likely to say to the craftsman: Sell my cloak for me</b> after you finish repairing it? It is possible that the craftsman mistakenly sold the utensils of another client instead, and gave to that other client the utensils that should have been sold. Since the owner of these utensils received the money from the sale of the other client’s utensils, the craftsman has a right to give the remaining utensils to the other client in the interim. This reasoning does not apply in the case of the house of mourning or a wedding feast, where one simply took utensils belonging to another.
<b>Rav Ḥiyya, son of Rav Naḥman, said: They taught</b> that it is permitted to use the utensils <b>only</b> if the craftsman <b>himself</b> gave them to his customer, as in that case, the above reasoning applies. <b>But if</b> the craftsman’s <b>wife or children</b> gave them to him, the customer may <b>not</b> use the utensils, as it is likely that they were given to him in error. <b>And even</b> if the craftsman himself gave the utensils to his customer, <b>we said</b> that it is permitted for him to use them <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the craftsman <b>said</b> to him, for example: I am returning <b>a cloak, without specification. But</b> if the craftsman said to him: I am returning <b>your cloak,</b> then he may <b>not</b> use it, as <b>this is not his cloak,</b> and clearly it was given to him in error.
§ The Gemara presents another statement with regard to craftsmen. <b>Abaye said to Rava: Come</b> and <b>I will show you what the swindlers of Pumbedita do.</b> There was a case where the owner of an item <b>said to</b> a craftsman: <b>Give me</b> back <b>my cloak [<i>sarbelai</i>]</b> that I gave you to repair, and the craftsman replied: <b>These matters never occurred.</b> The owner responded: <b>But I have witnesses who saw it in your</b> possession. The craftsman <b>said to</b> the owner: <b>That was a different</b> cloak that they saw. The witnesses are uncertain as to whether it was really his cloak. The owner then said: <b>Bring it out and we will see it,</b> so as to determine whose it is. The craftsman <b>said to</b> the owner: <b>In truth, I will not bring it out,</b> as you have no valid claim to the cloak and I am not willing to show you another’s property. This is the trickery to which Abaye referred, as it is not a sincere response, and the craftsman merely wishes to keep the cloak.
<b>Rava said</b> to Abaye: The craftsman <b>is saying well to</b> the owner, and his claim will be accepted,

Daf 46b

as it <b>is taught</b> in the earlier <i>baraita</i> that the owner has a valid claim only when he, and witnesses, <b>saw</b> his cloak in the possession of the launderer and can definitively identify it. He cannot state a claim based on the mere possibility that it is his. This validates the claim of the craftsmen of Pumbedita.
<b>Rav Ashi said: And if</b> the owner <b>is clever, he will render</b> the situation into one of his having <b>seen</b> his cloak, <b>as</b> the owner can <b>say to</b> the craftsman: <b>Why</b> are you <b>holding it? Is it not due to</b> the fact <b>that there is</b> money of <b>yours with me,</b> and you are using the cloak as a means of collecting the debt that I owe you? <b>Now bring out</b> my cloak before the appraisers <b>and they will appraise its</b> value, and then <b>you take</b> what is rightfully <b>yours, and I will take</b> what is rightfully <b>mine.</b> When the craftsman presents the cloak, the ruling will change, as the owner will have seen the cloak. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi:</b> If the craftsman is clever, he <b>can say to</b> the owner: <b>I do not need your appraisal,</b> as the <b>earlier ones who preceded you already appraised it</b> and determined that its value does not exceed that of your debt to me.
§ The Gemara discusses a ruling that it paraphrases from the mishna: <b>A sharecropper does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership of property in his possession. <b>Why</b> not? Isn’t it so that <b>until that time,</b> while he was definitely working as a sharecropper, he consumed only <b>half</b> of the produce of the land, <b>and now,</b> for the past three years, he consumed <b>all of</b> its produce? He should be able to establish the presumption of ownership by consuming more produce than a sharecropper does. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The ruling of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to family sharecroppers.</b> This type of sharecropper, who works for a family for many years, gathers all of the produce into his property, and then returns the landowner’s share. Therefore, his collecting all of the produce into his property does not establish the presumption of ownership.
<b>Rav Naḥman says: A sharecropper who installed</b> other <b>sharecroppers in his place has</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is <b>that</b> it is <b>not common</b> for <b>a person</b> to see <b>that</b> unknown <b>sharecroppers</b> have been <b>installed in his land and</b> remain <b>silent.</b> If the prior owner did not lodge a protest, it indicates that the sharecropper is the owner of the land.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A sharecropper who divided among</b> different <b>sharecroppers does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership by that act. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is that one can <b>say</b> that the landowner <b>merely appointed him</b> as <b>an administrator [<i>harmanya</i>],</b> and there is no indication that he is acting as an owner.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda sent</b> this message <b>to Rav Naḥman bar Yaakov: Our teacher, instruct us. Can a sharecropper testify</b> with regard to the ownership of a field of which he is a sharecropper, <b>or can he not testify,</b> as he is biased in his testimony? <b>Rav Yosef was sitting before</b> Rav Naḥman bar Yaakov and <b>said to him: This is what Shmuel said: A sharecropper can testify.</b> Rav Naḥman bar Yaakov said to him: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that a sharecropper <b>cannot testify?</b>
Rav Yosef answered: It is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that he cannot testify, is referring to a case <b>where there is produce on the land.</b> Therefore, he is biased in his testimony, as, if the current owner will lose possession of the land, the sharecropper will lose his right to consume the produce. <b>And that</b> statement of Shmuel that he can testify is referring to a case <b>where there is no produce on the land,</b> and he is not biased in his testimony.
§ The Gemara presents the word <i>Amalek</i> as <b>a mnemonic</b> for the cases discussed in the <i>baraita</i>. It stands for: <b><i>Ayin</i>,</b> guarantor [<i>arev</i>]; <b><i>mem</i>,</b> creditor [<i>malve</i>]; <b><i>lamed</i>,</b> buyer [<i>loke’aḥ</i>]; <b><i>kuf</i>,</b> unconditional guarantor [<i>kablan</i>].
<b>The Sages taught: A guarantor can testify for</b> the benefit of <b>the debtor</b> that the latter owns a particular parcel of land, <b>but that is</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>if</b> the debtor <b>has other land</b> from which the creditor can collect the debt. Otherwise, he is biased in his testimony, as the creditor could collect from him if the debtor were to lose ownership of this land. <b>A creditor can testify for</b> the benefit of <b>the debtor</b> that the latter owns a particular parcel of land, <b>but that is</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>if</b> the debtor <b>has other land</b> from which the creditor can collect. Otherwise, he is biased in his testimony, as this land is the only land available for collection.
Similarly, if two people purchase land from one seller, the <b>first buyer can testify for</b> the benefit of the <b>second buyer</b> if someone else were to claim that the land was his, <b>but that is</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>if</b> the second buyer <b>has other land</b> that he purchased from the same seller either concurrent with or subsequent to the first buyer’s purchase of the land in question. A creditor of the seller can collect a debt from the land that the seller sold most recently. Therefore, if the second buyer purchased only the land in question from the seller, the first buyer is biased in his testimony, as the second buyer’s ownership of the land prevents the creditor from collecting a debt from the land from the first buyer.

Daf 47a

With regard to <b>an unconditional guarantor [<i>kablan</i>],</b> from whom the creditor can collect even if the debtor is able to repay the loan, <b>some say</b> that he <b>can testify</b> on behalf of the debtor if the latter owns other land, <b>and some say</b> that he <b>cannot testify</b> even if the debtor owns other land. The Gemara explains: <b>Some say</b> that he <b>can testify</b> because he is <b>like a guarantor, and some say</b> that he <b>cannot testify,</b> as it is <b>preferable for him that both</b> fields <b>be in</b> the debtor’s <b>possession,</b> so <b>that when a creditor comes</b> to collect the debt, he will <b>take what he wants,</b> and not collect from the unconditional guarantor.
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: A craftsman does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, but the <b>son of a craftsman has</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>A sharecropper does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, but the <b>son of a sharecropper has</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. Both <b>a robber and</b> the <b>son of a robber do not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, but the <b>son of</b> the <b>son of a robber has</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> under which there is a distinction between the sons of the craftsman and the sharecropper and the son of the robber? <b>If</b> they <b>come</b> to court <b>with the claim</b> that the item in question <b>belonged to their fathers,</b> then <b>even these</b> sons of the craftsman and the sharecropper should <b>not</b> be able to establish the presumption of ownership, since their claims are based on ownership by those who cannot establish the presumption of ownership. <b>If</b> the case is <b>that</b> they <b>do not come</b> to court <b>with the claim</b> that the item in question <b>belonged to their fathers,</b> but that they own the item in their own right, then <b>even</b> the <b>son of a robber</b> should be able to establish the presumption of ownership.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this distinction in a case <b>where</b> the <b>witnesses say:</b> The prior owner <b>admitted to</b> their father <b>in our presence</b> that the property was the father’s and not stolen. The Gemara explains: With regard to <b>these,</b> the sons of the craftsman and sharecropper, it <b>can be said</b> that the sons <b>are saying the truth,</b> as their claim is substantiated by the testimony of the admission. But with regard to <b>that</b> one, the son of the robber, <b>even though</b> the prior owner <b>admitted</b> this, the son is <b>still not deemed credible, in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Kahana, as Rav Kahana said: If</b> the prior owner would <b>not</b> have <b>admitted</b> this <b>to</b> the robber, the robber <b>would have brought him and his donkey to</b> the <b>taskmaster [<i>leshaḥvar</i>],</b> meaning he would have caused him great difficulties. As a robber is assumed to be a ruffian, it is likely that the prior owner admitted this because he was intimidated, and not because the statement was true, so there is no evidence to support the claim of the robber’s son.
<b>Rava says:</b> There are <b>times when even</b> the <b>son of</b> the <b>son of</b> the <b>robber does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>What are the circumstances</b> under which this is so? This is so, for example, <b>in</b> a case <b>where</b> he <b>comes</b> to court <b>with the claim</b> that the item in question <b>belonged to his father’s father.</b> Since his claim is based on its having belonged to one who did not have the ability to establish the presumption of ownership, he too is unable to establish the presumption of ownership.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> under which one is considered <b>a robber,</b> who does not have the ability to establish the presumption of ownership? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In a case <b>such as where it is established</b> that he is in possession <b>of this field through robbery. And Rav Ḥisda says:</b> Not only in a case where there is knowledge about this specific field, but even in a case <b>such as</b> one where he is a member <b>of</b> the <b>household of so-and-so,</b> a certain known criminal family at the time <b>who kill people over monetary matters.</b> Since people would be afraid to lodge a protest against them, members of this family cannot establish the presumption of ownership with regard to any land.
§ <b>The Sages taught: A craftsman does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. If he <b>descended from his</b> position of <b>craftsmanship</b> and no longer works at that craft, then he <b>has</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership with regard to items related to his former craft. <b>A sharecropper does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. If he <b>descended from his</b> position as <b>a sharecropper,</b> then he <b>has</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership with regard to land that he works and from which he profits for three years. A son does not have the ability to establish the presumption of ownership with regard to his father’s property, nor a wife with regard to her husband’s property. But with regard to <b>a son who separated</b> himself from his father’s finances, <b>and a woman who became divorced, they are like other people</b> with regard to this property, and have the ability to establish the presumption of ownership.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, it was necessary</b> to state that <b>a son</b> who <b>separated</b> himself establishes the presumption of ownership. If the <i>baraita</i> had not stated this, it would <b>enter your mind to say</b> that the father <b>forgave</b> the unauthorized use of his land <b>by</b> his son, and did not lodge a protest despite the fact that the land did not belong to the son. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us that</b> this is <b>not</b> so, and that the son does establish the presumption of ownership. <b>But</b> in the case of the <b>woman who became divorced,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that she has no relationship with her ex-husband, so why is it necessary for the <i>baraita</i> to teach that she is able to establish the presumption of ownership? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach that she does not establish the presumption of ownership

Daf 47b

<b>in</b> a case where there is uncertainty whether <b>she is divorced or</b> whether <b>she is not divorced, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Zeira. As Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Wherever the Sages said</b> with regard to a woman that there is uncertainty whether <b>she is divorced or</b> whether <b>she is not divorced, her husband</b> is still <b>obligated with regard to her sustenance.</b> One might have thought that since she still has some right to her husband’s property, insofar as he still has an obligation with regard to her sustenance he would not lodge a protest if she used his land without his authorization. It is therefore necessary to clarify that this is not so, and she has the ability to establish the presumption of ownership in her husband’s property.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> Rav <b>Huna said to me</b> that with regard to <b>all of</b> the types of people who do not have the ability to establish the presumption of ownership, <b>when they bring proof</b> by means of a document or witnesses that a field belongs to them, <b>their proof is</b> a valid <b>proof and</b> the court <b>places</b> the <b>field in their possession.</b> But if there is <b>a robber who brings proof</b> that a field is his, <b>his proof is not</b> a valid <b>proof, and</b> the court <b>does not place</b> the <b>field in his possession.</b> This is due to a concern that the proof was obtained through illegitimate means.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 55b): If one <b>purchased</b> land <b>from a Sicarius [<i>Sikarikon</i>],</b> a violent gentile who had extorted the field from its owner with threats, <b>and</b> afterward one <b>returned and purchased</b> the same field <b>from the</b> prior <b>owner, his purchase is void,</b> as the owner of the field can say that he did not actually intend to sell him the field. This teaches that a purchase following a robbery is invalid, despite the existence of documents or testimony, rendering the statement of Rav Huna superfluous.
The Gemara answers: Rav Huna’s statement serves <b>to exclude that which Rav</b> says, <b>as Rav says: They taught</b> that the purchase of a field from the prior owner after one purchased it from a Sicarius is void <b>only</b> when the prior owner <b>said to</b> the buyer at the time of the sale: <b>Go take possession and</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> the field, but did not write a document. <b>But</b> if the transaction was performed along <b>with a document</b> being given, the buyer <b>acquired</b> the field.
Therefore, Rav Huna <b>teaches us</b> that he rules <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel, as</b> Shmuel <b>says: He does not acquire</b> the field <b>even</b> if the transaction was performed along <b>with a document</b> being given, <b>until</b> the owner of the field <b>writes a property guarantee,</b> i.e., a document that states that if the property is seized by the seller’s creditor, the seller will reimburse the buyer for his loss. Writing such a document indicates that it is a sincere transaction.
<b>And Rav Beivai concludes that</b> discussion of the statement of Rav Huna, that a robber does not retain possession of the field even if he brings proof of the transaction, with a comment <b>in the name of Rav Naḥman:</b> The robber <b>does not have</b> rights to the <b>land, but he does have</b> rights to the <b>money</b> that he paid for the land, and the owner has to reimburse him. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement</b> that the robber is reimbursed <b>said?</b> It is specifically <b>where</b> the <b>witnesses said:</b> The robber <b>counted</b> out the money <b>for</b> the owner and gave it to <b>him in our presence; but</b> if the <b>witnesses said:</b> The owner <b>admitted to</b> the robber <b>in our presence</b> that he received payment, then the robber is <b>not</b> reimbursed, as the admission may have been made under duress. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Kahana, who says: If</b> the owner would <b>not</b> have <b>admitted to</b> the robber that he received payment, the robber <b>would have brought him and his donkey to</b> the <b>taskmaster.</b>
§ Apropos transactions performed under duress, the Gemara cites that which <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If one was <b>suspended,</b> e.g., from a tree, and thereby coerced to sell a certain item, <b>and he sold</b> it, <b>his sale is valid. What is the reason?</b> The Gemara suggests that it is because <b>whatever a person sells, were it not</b> for the fact <b>that</b> he is <b>compelled</b> by his need for money, he <b>would not sell</b> it, <b>and even so, his sale is valid.</b> This indicates that a transaction performed under duress is valid. The Gemara rejects this: <b>But perhaps duress</b> that results <b>from his own</b> needs, such as his need for money, <b>is different from duress</b> that results <b>from another,</b> as in this case. <b>Rather,</b> the basis for Rav Huna’s ruling is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 48a

With regard to one who pledges to bring a burnt-offering, the verse states: “If his offering be a burnt-offering of the herd, <b>he shall offer it</b> a male without blemish; he shall bring it to the door of the Tent of Meeting, according to his will, before the Lord” (Leviticus 1:3). The seemingly superfluous phrase “he shall offer it” <b>teaches that they</b> can <b>coerce him</b> to bring the offering. One <b>might</b> have thought that it can be offered entirely <b>against his will,</b> by taking it from his possession and sacrificing it. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “According to his will”</b> (Leviticus 1:3). <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? <b>They coerce him</b> with various punishments <b>until he says: I want</b> to bring the offering. This seems to prove that consent resulting from coercion is considered to be valid consent. Perhaps this principle can apply to acquisition, as a source for Rav Huna’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>But perhaps there it is different, since he is</b> in fact <b>amenable to</b> achieving <b>atonement,</b> despite his earlier statement to the contrary. <b>But rather,</b> prove Rav Huna’s ruling <b>from the latter clause</b> of a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 21a): <b>And similarly you find</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with bills of divorce,</b> that when the court rules that he must divorce his wife, <b>they coerce him until he says: I want</b> to divorce my wife.
The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>But perhaps there it is different, because it is a mitzva to listen to the statement of the Sages.</b> The assumption is that when he is required by the court to divorce his wife, his real desire is to perform the mitzva of listening to the Sages, and therefore he actually wants to divorce her. This does not apply to the case of a transaction performed under duress. <b>Rather,</b> Rav Huna’s ruling does not have a source in a mishna or <i>baraita</i>, but <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning: By means of his being coerced,</b> the seller then willingly <b>decides</b> to sell the field <b>and transfers</b> it.
<b>Rav Yehuda raises an objection</b> to Rav Huna’s ruling from a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 88b): With regard to <b>a bill of divorce that</b> the husband <b>was compelled</b> by the court to write and give his wife, if he was compelled <b>by a Jewish</b> court it is <b>valid, but</b> if he was compelled <b>by gentiles</b> it is <b>not valid. And with regard to gentiles, they may beat him</b> at the request of the Jewish court <b>and say to him: Do what the Jews are telling you,</b> and the divorce would then be valid. The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> is a bill of divorce compelled by a gentile court invalid? <b>There too, let us say</b> that <b>as a result of his coercion,</b> the husband <b>decides</b> to do what the court says <b>and divorces</b> her.
The Gemara answers: In fact that reasoning is correct, as for this reason <b>wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Rav Mesharshiyya says: By Torah law</b> a bill of divorce that the husband was compelled to give, <b>even</b> if he was compelled <b>by gentiles,</b> is <b>valid. And what is the reason</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that if it is compelled <b>by gentiles</b> it is <b>not valid?</b> It is <b>so that each and every</b> woman <b>will not go and</b> through temptation or bribery <b>depend on a gentile</b> to compel her husband to divorce her, <b>and</b> thereby <b>release herself from her husband</b> illegitimately.
<b>Rav Hamnuna raises an objection</b> to Rav Huna’s ruling from a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 55b): If one <b>purchased</b> land <b>from a Sicarius and</b> afterward <b>returned and purchased</b> the same field <b>from the</b> prior <b>owner, his purchase is void,</b> as the prior owner of the field can say that he did not actually intend to sell the field to this buyer. <b>But why</b> is the sale invalid? <b>There too, let us say</b> that <b>by means of his being coerced,</b> the seller then willingly <b>decides</b> to sell the field <b>and transfers</b> it.
The Gemara answers: In fact that reasoning is correct, as <b>it was stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Rav says: They taught</b> that the purchase from the prior owner after the purchase from a Sicarius is void <b>only</b> when the prior owner <b>said to</b> the buyer at the time of the sale: <b>Go take possession and</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> the field, but did not write a bill of sale. <b>But</b> if the transaction was performed along <b>with a bill</b> of sale being given, the buyer <b>acquires</b> the field.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Shmuel, who says: He does not acquire</b> the field <b>even</b> if the transaction was performed along <b>with a bill</b> of sale being given, <b>what can be said?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Shmuel concedes</b> that the sale is valid <b>where</b> the buyer <b>gave money</b> for the field even though the owner sold it under duress, as is the case in the ruling of Rav Huna.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rav Beivai, who concludes that</b> statement of Rav Huna with a comment <b>in the name of Rav Naḥman:</b> The robber <b>does not have</b> rights to the <b>land,</b> but <b>he does have</b> rights to the <b>money</b> that he paid for the land, and the owner has to reimburse him, <b>what can be said?</b> Rav Beivai, who is referring to a case where there was a payment, as the robber is being reimbursed, seems to hold that the sale is invalid even where the robber paid for the field. The Gemara answers: The statement of <b>Rav Beivai is an</b> amoraic <b>statement,</b> not a citation of a tannaitic ruling, <b>and Rav Huna,</b> who is also an <i>amora</i>, <b>does not hold</b> in accordance with that amoraic <b>statement.</b>
<b>Rava says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that if one was <b>suspended</b> and thereby coerced to sell a certain item, <b>and he sold</b> it, <b>his sale is valid. And we said</b> that this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b>

Daf 48b

<b>in</b> a case where the seller was compelled to sell <b>an unspecified field.</b> Since he had a choice as to which field to sell, the presumption is that he sold it sincerely. <b>But in</b> a case where the one coercing him specified <b>this</b> specific <b>field</b> to be sold, the sale is <b>not</b> valid, as the seller did not decide freely on any aspect of the sale.
<b>And even in</b> a case where the one coercing him specified <b>this</b> specific <b>field</b> to be sold, <b>we said</b> that the sale is invalid <b>only where</b> the seller <b>did not count [<i>artzei</i>]</b> the <b>money</b> for the field, <b>but</b> if the seller <b>did count</b> the <b>money,</b> then we do <b>not</b> say that the sale is invalid.
<b>And we said</b> that the sale is invalid in the case of a specified field when money was not counted <b>only where</b> the seller <b>had no</b> way <b>to avoid</b> the coercion. <b>But</b> if the seller <b>had</b> a way <b>to avoid</b> the coercion and did not avoid it, then we do <b>not</b> say that the sale is invalid.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> in all of</b> these cases is that <b>the sale is valid, and</b> this is so <b>even in</b> the case of <b>a specified field.</b> This can be inferred <b>because</b> the case of <b>a woman</b> forced to accept betrothal <b>is comparable to</b> the case of <b>a specified field,</b> as a specific man is performing the betrothal, <b>and Ameimar says:</b> If a man <b>suspended</b> a woman <b>and betrothed</b> her, <b>his betrothal is valid,</b> despite the fact that she was coerced.
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said: In</b> the case of <b>a woman</b> who was forced to accept betrothal, the <b>betrothal is certainly not</b> valid. <b>This</b> man <b>acted improperly; consequently,</b> the Sages <b>acted improperly with him, and the Sages expropriated her betrothal from him.</b>
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi:</b> This <b>works out well</b> in a case <b>where he betrothed</b> his wife <b>with money,</b> as it is possible to say that the Sages expropriated from the possession of its owner the money used for the betrothal, resulting in a retroactive cancellation of the betrothal. But if <b>he betrothed</b> her <b>by means of sexual intercourse,</b> then <b>what is there to say?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him: The Sages deemed his sexual intercourse</b> as <b>licentious sexual intercourse,</b> which does not create a bond of betrothal.
§ The Gemara relates: Someone named <b>Tavi suspended</b> another person named <b>Pafi on a <i>kinara</i> and</b> compelled him to <b>sell</b> his field. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana signed</b> both <b>on</b> Pafi’s preemptive <b>declaration</b> nullifying the sale (see 40b) <b>and on</b> the <b>bill of sale [<i>ashkalta</i>]. Rav Huna said:</b> The <b>one who signed on</b> the preemptive <b>declaration</b> acted <b>well</b> by <b>signing, and</b> the <b>one who signed on</b> the <b>bill of sale</b> acted <b>well</b> by <b>signing.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, Rav Huna’s statement is problematic. <b>If</b> the preemptive <b>declaration</b> is valid, then there is <b>no</b> place for <b>a bill of sale. And if</b> the <b>bill of sale</b> is valid, then there is <b>no</b> place for a preemptive <b>declaration.</b> How can Rav Huna commend signing on both of these mutually exclusive documents? The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what Rav Huna <b>is saying: If</b> it were <b>not for</b> his also having signed the preemptive <b>declaration,</b> the <b>one who signed on</b> the <b>bill of sale</b> acted <b>well</b> by <b>signing.</b> In this statement, <b>Rav Huna</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rav Huna says:</b> If one was <b>suspended</b> and thereby coerced to sell a certain item <b>and he sold</b> it, <b>his sale is valid.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so</b> that Rabba bar bar Ḥana can, by means of the preemptive declaration, invalidate the bill of sale that he himself signed? <b>But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say:</b> With regard to <b>witnesses who said: Our statement</b> that we signed <b>was</b> a document of <b>trust,</b> i.e., a false promissory note given by one person to another, trusting that he will not make use of it until there is an actual loan,

Daf 49a

they <b>are not deemed credible.</b> And similarly, witnesses who said: <b>Our statement</b> that we signed <b>was</b> accompanied by a preemptive <b>declaration, are not deemed credible.</b> They cannot negate the testimony of the document that they themselves signed by claiming that there had been a preemptive declaration. Similarly, how could Rabba bar bar Ḥana’s signing of the preemptive declaration override his signing the bill of sale?
The Gemara answers: <b>That matter</b> of witnesses not being deemed credible to nullify a document applies only when the witnesses attempt to nullify the document by means of <b>an oral</b> declaration, <b>as an oral</b> declaration <b>cannot come and weaken</b> a written <b>document. But</b> if the witnesses attempt to nullify the bill of sale by means of testimony <b>in</b> another <b>document,</b> e.g., by signing the preemptive declaration, then this preemptive <b>document</b> can <b>come and weaken</b> a written <b>document,</b> in this case, the bill of sale.
The Gemara returns to discuss <b>the</b> matter <b>itself: Rav Naḥman says</b> that witnesses who said: <b>Our statement</b> that we signed <b>was</b> a document of <b>trust, are not deemed credible.</b> And similarly, witnesses who said: <b>Our statement</b> that we signed <b>was</b> accompanied by a preemptive <b>declaration, are not deemed credible.</b>
<b>And Mar bar Rav Ashi says</b> that witnesses who said: <b>Our statement</b> that we signed <b>was</b> a statement of <b>trust, are not deemed credible;</b> but witnesses who said: <b>Our statement</b> that we signed <b>was</b> accompanied by a preemptive <b>declaration, are deemed credible. What is the reason</b> for the difference between the cases? The reason is <b>that this</b> document that was accompanied by a preemptive declaration <b>may be written,</b> as it is merely written under duress, <b>but that</b> document of trust <b>may not be written,</b> as it is a false document. Testifying that they wrote it is self-incriminating, and the witnesses are not deemed credible to incriminate themselves.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>a man does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to his wife’s property</b> and a wife does not have the ability to establish the presumption of ownership with regard to her husband’s property. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious? Since he has</b> the right <b>to</b> enjoy <b>the profits</b> of her property while they are married, <b>it is</b> known <b>that</b> he is only <b>enjoying the profits</b> and that he has no claim to the field itself. On what grounds, then, would he establish the presumption of ownership?
The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to teach this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the husband <b>wrote to</b> his wife: <b>I do not have any legal</b> dealings <b>or involvement with your property,</b> i.e., he forfeits his right to enjoy the profits of her property, and therefore if he subsequently did enjoy the profits of her field, one might assume that it is because he acquired the land from her. It was therefore necessary for the mishna to teach that this does not indicate that he owns the land, since it is possible that she does not prevent him from enjoying the profits, due to their relationship.
The Gemara asks: <b>And if</b> he <b>wrote</b> this <b>to her, what of it? And isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who says to another: I do not have</b> any <b>legal</b> dealings <b>or involvement concerning this field, or: I have no dealings with it, or: My hands are removed from it, has not said anything.</b> That is to say, these statements have no legal standing.
The scholars <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai said</b> with regard to <b>this: The mishna</b> states its ruling <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>writes</b> this formulation <b>to her while she is still</b> only <b>betrothed,</b> before he had any rights to her property. Therefore, he is able to prevent his rights from taking effect after the marriage. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Kahana, as Rav Kahana says:</b>

Daf 49b

With regard to <b>an inheritance that comes to a person from another place,</b> i.e., an inheritance one will receive in the future, <b>a person can make a condition about it</b> from the outset <b>that he will not inherit it,</b> since one can waive his future rights to property that is not currently his. <b>And</b> this ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava, as Rava said</b> that with regard to <b>anyone who says: I do not want</b> to avail myself <b>of an ordinance of the Sages such as this</b> one that was instituted for my benefit, one <b>listens to him.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>Such as this</b> one? The Gemara explains: Rava is referring to <b>that</b> statement <b>of Rav Huna,</b> who said that <b>Rav says</b> a certain ruling. <b>As Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: A woman can say to her husband: I will not be sustained</b> by you and, in turn, <b>I will not work,</b> i.e., you will not keep my earnings. The Sages instituted that a husband must provide sustenance for his wife, and in exchange is entitled to her wages. Since this was instituted for the benefit of wives, the wife is able to opt out of this arrangement. Similarly, the husband may waive his rights to the profits from his wife’s land. It is in such a circumstance that the mishna rules that even if he relinquished his rights, he does not establish the presumption of ownership by enjoying the profits.
§ The mishna teaches that a husband does not establish the presumption of ownership of his wife’s field by enjoying its profits. The Gemara suggests: By inference, the husband <b>has</b> the ability to bring <b>proof</b> that he purchased the field from his wife or received it as a gift from her and consequently be regarded as the owner of the field. The Gemara asks: Why is this proof decisive? <b>Let her say: I did</b> it, i.e., I gave or sold the field to my husband, only to <b>please my husband,</b> but I did not mean it.
The Gemara quotes a source for this claim: <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 55b): If one first <b>purchased</b> land <b>from the husband and</b> afterward <b>returned and purchased</b> it <b>from the wife,</b> i.e., he purchased her rights to this land for after the death of her husband or in the event of their divorce, as stipulated in her marriage contract, then <b>his transaction is void. Apparently, she said: I did</b> it, i.e., signed this bill of sale, only to <b>please my husband,</b> but I did not mean it. <b>Here too let her say: I did</b> it only to <b>please my husband</b> but did not mean to give or sell the field to him.
The Gemara answers: <b>But wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that a woman can claim that she acted only in order to please her husband is not stated with regard to all of her property, but <b>is necessary only with regard to those three</b> types of <b>fields</b> that have special status: <b>One</b> field about <b>which he wrote to her in her marriage contract</b> that it would serve as payment of her marriage contract;

Daf 50a

<b>and one that he specified to her</b> as payment <b>for her marriage contract,</b> even though it was not stipulated explicitly in the contract; <b>and one</b> in a case <b>where she brought into</b> the marriage <b>an appraisal</b> of a field <b>from her own</b> property that she owned prior to the marriage, which took on the status of guaranteed property, meaning that she will receive it if her husband dies or divorces her. If a field of one of these three types is sold with her approval, she can claim that she did not truly consent to this sale, but stated her consent only in order to please her husband.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>To exclude what</b> type of property did Rabba specify these three types of fields? <b>If we say</b> that he intends <b>to exclude</b> the <b>rest of</b> the husband’s <b>property</b> secured to pay her marriage contract, it is <b>all the more so</b> the case <b>that he will bear</b> her <b>enmity</b> if she does not agree to the sale, <b>as he will say to her:</b> You <b>have placed your eyes on divorce or on</b> my <b>death,</b> i.e., you will not allow me to sell my property because you are expecting and planning for my death or our divorce. Therefore, she should be able to claim that she consented to the sale only in order to please her husband with regard to other property as well.
<b>Rather,</b> these three types of fields were specified in order <b>to exclude usufruct property,</b> i.e., property that belongs to the wife and remains in her possession while the husband has the right to enjoy the profits, in which case if the wife consents to the sale, it is valid. The Gemara asks: But <b>doesn’t Ameimar say</b> that if there was <b>a man or a woman,</b> i.e., a husband or a wife, <b>who sold</b> the wife’s <b>usufruct property, they did not accomplish anything,</b> as the sale does not take effect?
The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> the statement <b>of Ameimar was stated,</b> it was to say that neither the husband nor the wife can sell the property unilaterally. <b>Where he sold</b> the property <b>and</b> then <b>died, she can come and remove</b> it from the buyer. <b>Alternatively,</b> in a case where <b>she sold</b> it <b>and</b> then <b>died, he can come and remove it, due to a rabbinic ordinance, and in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina, as Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says:</b> When the Sanhedrin convened <b>in Usha, they instituted</b> that in the case of <b>a woman who sold</b> her <b>usufruct property</b> in her husband’s lifetime <b>and</b> then <b>died, the husband repossesses</b> it <b>from the buyers.</b>
<b>But where the two of them sold it to someone, or if she sold it to</b> her husband, <b>the sale is valid.</b> The inference that the Gemara drew from the mishna, that if the husband produces evidence that his wife sold usufruct property to him then he is regarded as the owner, is relevant when she sells her usufruct property to him.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that <b>Ameimar said</b> his statement <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> who holds that one can sell property only if he possesses the item itself and also has the right to enjoy its profits.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who sells his</b> Canaanite <b>slave</b> to another, <b>and contracted with him</b> that the sale is <b>on the condition that</b> the slave <b>will serve</b> the seller for <b>thirty days</b> before he is transferred to the buyer, the outcome of this sale is that during those thirty days, the first master enjoys the use of the slave and the buyer is the owner of the slave himself. As detailed in the Torah (Exodus 21:18–21), if one strikes another and the injury leads directly to the victim’s death, the one who struck him is subject to court-imposed capital punishment. But if a master strikes his Canaanite slave, and the slave lingers with his injuries for more than a day or two days and then dies, the master is exempt from court-imposed capital punishment. The <i>baraita</i> addresses who is considered the owner of the slave with regard to this <i>halakha</i>.
The <i>baraita</i> states four opinions: <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that during those thirty days, only <b>the first</b> master <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>“a day or two days”</b> (Exodus 21:21). Rabbi Meir holds that in this case, the first master is included in this exemption, <b>because</b> the slave <b>is under his</b> authority, as he enjoys the use of the slave, <b>but the second</b> master <b>is not</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>“a day or two days,” because</b> the slave <b>is not under his</b> authority.
Rabbi Meir’s reasoning is that <b>he holds</b> that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and the <b>profits</b> it engenders is <b>like ownership of the item itself.</b> The status of the first master as the owner negates the possibility that the second master would be regarded as the owner with regard to this <i>halakha</i>, and he would not be included in the exemption.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>the second</b> master <b>is</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>“a day or two days,” because</b> the slave <b>is “his money”</b> (Exodus 21:21), i.e., his property; but <b>the first</b> master is <b>not</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>“a day or two days,” because</b> the slave <b>is not “his money.”</b> Rabbi Yehuda’s reasoning is that <b>he holds</b> that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and the <b>profits</b> it engenders is <b>not like ownership of the item itself.</b> Therefore, the first master, who currently enjoys the use of the slave, does not have the status of an owner with regard to this <i>halakha</i>.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that

Daf 50b

<b>both of them are</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>“a day or two days.” This</b> first master is included <b>because</b> the slave <b>is under his</b> authority, <b>and that</b> second master is included <b>because</b> the slave <b>is “his money.”</b> The Gemara explains Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning: <b>And he is uncertain if ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and the <b>profits</b> it engenders is <b>like ownership of the item itself,</b> in which case only the first master would be exempt, or <b>if</b> it is <b>not like ownership of the item itself,</b> in which case only the second master would be exempt. <b>And</b> where there is <b>an uncertainty</b> in a case of <b>capital</b> law, the ruling is <b>to be lenient.</b> Therefore, neither of them would receive court-imposed capital punishment in this case.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar says</b> that <b>both of them are not</b> included <b>in</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> of <b>“a day or two days,”</b> and both would receive court-imposed capital punishment. <b>This</b> second master is not included <b>because</b> the slave <b>is not under his</b> authority, <b>and that</b> first master is not included <b>because</b> the slave <b>is not “his money.”</b> Rabbi Eliezer holds that one must both own the slave himself and enjoy the use of the slave to be included in the exemption.
The Gemara explains how Ameimar’s statement is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Elazar. <b>And Rava says: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Elazar?</b> The <b>verse states:</b> “Notwithstanding if he continue a day or two days, <b>he shall not be punished; for he is his money”</b> (Exodus 21:21), and he understands this to be referring to a slave that is <b>“his money,”</b> a slave <b>that is unique to him,</b> so this exemption does not apply to one who does not have total ownership of the slave. Rabbi Elazar holds that one is considered to own an item only if he owns the item itself and also enjoys the use of it. This is the source of Ameimar’s statement that neither the husband nor the wife can sell usufruct property: The husband cannot sell it because he does not own it, and the wife cannot sell it because only the husband has the right to enjoy the profits.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>a man does not have</b> the ability to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to his wife’s property.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rav say</b> that <b>a married woman must protest?</b> The Gemara clarifies: <b>With regard to whom</b> must she protest? <b>If we say: With regard to another,</b> i.e., one who is not her husband who has taken possession of her property, that is problematic: <b>But doesn’t Rav say</b> that <b>one cannot establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to the property of a married woman,</b> as she can claim that she did not lodge a protest because she expected her husband to do so? <b>Rather,</b> Rav’s intention must be that she must lodge a protest <b>with regard to the husband.</b> This indicates that absent her protest, it is possible for a husband to establish the presumption of ownership with regard to her property, in contrast to the ruling of the mishna.
<b>Rava said: Actually,</b> Rav is referring to her lodging a protest <b>with regard to the husband, and</b> is speaking of a case <b>where</b> he <b>dug pits, ditches, and caves in</b> her property. In other words, he did not simply work and profit from the land, but damaged it in a way that demonstrates that he considered himself the owner. If he does this for three years and she does not lodge a protest, he establishes the presumption of ownership. The mishna, which states that he cannot establish the presumption of ownership, is referring to standard use.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: There is no presumptive ownership with regard to damage?</b> This is understood to mean that one cannot establish the presumption of ownership of another’s field by damaging it, as it is not considered to be standard use. Therefore, even after three years have passed the owner can remove one from his field. Since in this case the husband is damaging the field, he should not be able to establish the presumption of ownership.
The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that this means that <b>the <i>halakha</i> of presumptive ownership does not</b> apply <b>with regard to damage,</b> meaning that one who damages another’s property without the owner lodging a protest does not need three years to establish the presumption of ownership, but does so immediately, as an owner who sees another damage his land is expected to protest without delay. Consequently, a husband who digs pits and the like in his wife’s property without her lodging a protest establishes the presumption of ownership immediately.
The Gemara offers an alternative answer. <b>If you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Was it not stated with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> that there is no presumptive ownership with regard to damage that <b>Rav Mari says:</b> Damage is referring specifically <b>to smoke,</b> and <b>Rav Zevid says</b> that it is referring <b>to a bathroom?</b> The statement that there is no presumptive ownership [<i>ḥazaka</i>] with regard to damage was not stated concerning establishing the presumption of ownership of property, but concerning acquiring the privilege [<i>ḥazaka</i>] to engage in certain activities on one’s own property, and is stating that even if one has engaged in activities that produce smoke or foul odors, the fact that the neighbors did not lodge a protest in the past does not prevent them from doing so in the future.
<b>Rav Yosef said: Actually,</b> Rav is referring to her lodging a protest <b>with regard to another, and</b> is speaking of a case <b>where</b> the one who has possession of her property worked and <b>profited</b> from the field for <b>part</b> of the time necessary to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>during the husband’s lifetime, and</b> for <b>three</b> additional years <b>after the husband’s death.</b> In this case, if the woman does not lodge a protest, the possessor establishes the presumption of ownership, <b>since if he wanted</b> to, he could <b>say to</b> the woman: <b>I purchased it from you</b> and then possessed the field for three years, and he would be awarded the field. <b>When he said to her as well: You sold</b> the field <b>to</b> your husband <b>and he sold it to me, he is deemed credible.</b>
The Gemara returns to discuss Rav’s statement: With regard to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself, Rav says</b> that <b>one cannot establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership <b>with regard to the property of a married woman,</b>

Daf 51a

<b>but the judges of</b> the <b>exile said</b> that <b>one can establish</b> the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>judges of</b> the <b>exile. Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav:</b> Has the <b>Master retracted his <i>halakha</i></b> that one cannot establish the presumption of ownership with regard to the property of a married woman? Rav <b>said to them: I said</b> that the opinion of the judges of the exile <b>is reasonable,</b> as the presumption of ownership can be established with regard the property of a married woman under certain circumstances. The Gemara comments: This is <b>like</b> that ruling <b>of Rav Yosef</b> with regard to one who possesses the land for three years after the death of the husband.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And a wife does not have</b> the ability to establish the presumption of ownership <b>with regard to her husband’s property.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious? Since she has</b> the right to <b>sustenance</b> from her husband’s property, <b>she is enjoying</b> the profits as payment of her <b>sustenance,</b> so her use of the property does not establish the presumption of ownership. The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in the event <b>that he designated another</b> parcel of <b>land for her sustenance.</b> The mishna teaches that even if she enjoys the profits of a second field for three years, she does not establish the presumption of ownership of that field.
The Gemara asks: By inference, the wife <b>has</b> the ability to bring <b>proof</b> of her ownership and take possession of her husband’s field. Why is this proof valid? <b>Let</b> him <b>say that he desires to expose</b> her concealed <b>money.</b> If he offers to sell the field to her and she agrees, it will be discovered that she has money of which he had been unaware. His intention was never to sell the property, but to claim money to which he is entitled.
Can one <b>conclude from this</b> mishna that in the case of <b>one who sells a field to his wife, she has acquired</b> it, <b>and we do not say</b> that <b>he desires to expose</b> her concealed <b>money?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> as one may <b>say</b> that the inference from the mishna <b>that</b> if she <b>has proof</b> then she has ownership rights is the <i>halakha</i> only <b>with regard to a deed of gift,</b> as, if her husband gave her the field as a gift, he cannot claim that he did so in order to expose her concealed money.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Naḥman said to Rav Huna:</b> The <b>Master was not with us in the evening</b> in the study hall that is <b>within the boundaries</b> of the town, <b>where we said a superior matter.</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: What superior matter did you say?</b> Rav Naḥman responded: In the case of <b>one who sells a field to his wife, she has acquired</b> it, <b>and we do not say</b> that <b>he desires to expose</b> her concealed <b>money.</b>
Rav Huna <b>said to him:</b> That is <b>obvious; remove</b> the <b>money from here and she will acquire</b> the property <b>by means of the bill</b> of sale, as, even if she has not yet given him the money, she acquires the land by means of the bill of sale. <b>Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 26a): <b>Property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land, <b>can be acquired by</b> means of giving <b>money, by</b> means of giving <b>a document, or by</b> means of <b>taking possession</b> of it?
Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: But wasn’t it stated with regard to this</b> that <b>Shmuel says: They taught</b> that the document alone suffices <b>only</b> if the transaction is <b>with a deed of gift, but</b> if the transaction is <b>with a bill of sale,</b> the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> the property <b>until he gives him its money?</b> Rav Huna responded: <b>But didn’t Rav Hamnuna raise an objection</b> to this, based on this following <i>baraita</i>: <b>How</b> is acquisition <b>by</b> means of giving <b>a document</b> performed? If he <b>wrote</b> it <b>for him on paper or earthenware,</b> then <b>even though</b> the paper or the earthenware <b>is not worth</b> even <b>one <i>peruta</i>,</b> if he writes: <b>My field is sold to you,</b> or: <b>My field is acquired by you</b> as a gift, <b>it is thereby sold or given.</b> This indicates that a document suffices to complete an acquisition both in the case of a sale and a gift.
Rav Naḥman responded: <b>But is it not</b> so that <b>he,</b> Rav Hamnuna, <b>raises the objection and he</b> himself <b>resolves it?</b> The <i>baraita</i> states its ruling <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>sells his field due to its poor</b> quality. The seller wants to be rid of his field due to its low value, and would like to transfer ownership of it as quickly as possible. In this case, writing a document suffices to complete the acquisition. By contrast, in standard cases it does not. Since the acquisition of a field requires monetary payment in addition to a bill of sale, Rav Naḥman’s statement, that if one sells a field to his wife the sale is valid and we do not say that he desires to expose her concealed money, is a novelty.
The Gemara notes that in interpreting this <i>baraita</i>, <b>Rav Beivai</b> would <b>conclude in the name of Rav Naḥman, or,</b> according to another version, <b>Rav Ashi says:</b> Why does a document suffice for him to acquire the land? It is because it is assumed that <b>he wanted to give it to him as a gift. And why did he write</b> the document <b>for him</b> employing the <b>terminology of a sale?</b> It was <b>in order to enhance</b> the <b>power</b> of the one acquiring the land, since with regard to a property guarantee, i.e., a document that states that if the property is seized by the seller’s creditor, the seller will reimburse the buyer for his loss, a bill of sale is superior to a deed of gift.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the ruling of Rav Naḥman, that we do not say that he desires to expose her concealed money, from a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>borrowed</b> money <b>from</b> his own <b>slave and</b> then <b>frees him,</b> or if one borrowed money <b>from his wife and</b> then <b>divorces her, they do not have any</b> claim <b>on him,</b> and he need not repay them. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Is it <b>not because we say</b> that <b>he desires to expose</b> their concealed <b>money,</b> and his taking of the loan was a mere artifice to claim money to which he was entitled?
The Gemara answers: It <b>is different there,</b> because there is an additional reason to think it was an artifice, <b>as</b> it is <b>uncomfortable for him to make</b> applicable to <b>himself</b> the verse: “The rich rules over the poor, and <b>the borrower is servant to the lender”</b> (Proverbs 22:7). It is therefore reasonable to posit that his intention was not to borrow money, but to expose the concealed money that was in the possession of his slave or wife. This concern does not apply to one who sells property to his wife, and therefore the sale is valid.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna bar Avin sent</b> a ruling to those in the study hall: In the case of <b>one who sells a field to his wife, she has acquired</b> it,

Daf 51b

<b>and</b> as long as they remain married, the <b>husband enjoys the profits,</b> as he would with any usufruct property. <b>But Rabbi Abba and Rabbi Abbahu and all of the great</b> Sages <b>of the generation said</b> that the assumption is that the husband <b>wanted to give it to her as a gift. And why did he write</b> the deed <b>for her</b> employing terminology indicating that it is <b>for the sake of a sale?</b> It was <b>in order to enhance</b> her <b>power.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> to the ruling that the wife acquires the property: If one <b>borrowed from</b> his own <b>slave and</b> then <b>freed him,</b> or if one borrowed <b>from his wife and</b> then <b>divorced her, they do not have any</b> claim <b>on him,</b> and he need not repay them. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Is it <b>not because</b> we <b>say</b> that <b>he desired to expose</b> their concealed <b>money,</b> and his taking of the loan was merely an artifice to claim money to which he was entitled? Similarly, the assumption should be that his sale to her was merely an artifice.
The Gemara answers: It <b>is different there,</b> because there is an additional reason to think it was an artifice, <b>as</b> it is <b>uncomfortable for a person to be</b> described by the verse: “The rich rules over the poor, and <b>the borrower is servant to the lender”</b> (Proverbs 22:7). It is therefore reasonable to posit that his intention was not to borrow money, but to expose the concealed money that was in the possession of his slave or wife. This concern does not apply to one who sells property to his wife, and therefore the sale is valid.
The Gemara quotes a related statement. <b>Rav says:</b> In the case of <b>one who sells a field to his wife, she has acquired</b> it, <b>and the husband enjoys the profits.</b> In the case of one who gives a married woman the field <b>as a gift, she has acquired it and the husband does not enjoy the profits,</b> since he gave it to her completely. <b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> In <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case <b>she has acquired</b> it, <b>and the husband does not enjoy the profits.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Ḥisda performed an action in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar,</b> and did not allow a husband to enjoy the profits of a field he sold to his wife. <b>Rabban Ukva and Rabban Neḥemya, the sons of Rav’s daughters, said to Rav Ḥisda:</b> Does the <b>Master abandon a greater</b> Sage, i.e., Rav, the greatest Sage of his generation, <b>and act in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>a lesser</b> Sage, i.e., Rabbi Elazar, who was Rav’s student? Rav Ḥisda <b>said to them: But I too am acting in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>a greater</b> Sage, <b>as when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, <b>he said</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> said: In <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case <b>she has acquired</b> it, <b>and the husband does not enjoy the profits.</b> I am consequently not relying exclusively on Rabbi Elazar’s opinion, but also on that of Rabbi Yoḥanan.
<b>Rava says</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is: In the case of <b>one who sells a field to his wife, she has not acquired</b> it, <b>and the husband enjoys the profits.</b> In the case of one who gives a married woman the field <b>as a gift, she has acquired it and the husband does not enjoy the profits.</b> The Gemara asks with regard to the first <i>halakha</i>: Can these <b>two</b> ostensibly contradictory rulings be given? Rava’s statement that the wife has not acquired the field means that the husband still owns it, while his statement that the husband enjoys the profits, i.e., he merely enjoys the profits but does not own the field, indicates that the field itself is owned by the wife.
The Gemara responds: This is <b>not difficult,</b> because Rava is referring to two different cases. <b>Here,</b> where he says that she has not acquired the land, he is referring to a case <b>where</b> her <b>money</b> was <b>concealed,</b> and the sale was an artifice to expose it; while <b>there,</b> where he says that she acquires the land, he is referring to a case <b>where</b> she had <b>money that is not concealed. As Rav Yehuda says:</b> If she purchased the field with <b>concealed money, she has not acquired</b> it; if she purchased it with <b>money that is not concealed, she has acquired</b> it.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not accept deposits from women, and not from slaves, and not from children.</b> Since it is likely that they do not own property, they might have taken the item without authorization from their husband, master, or parent, respectively. Consequently, one should not accept the deposit. If, however, one <b>accepted</b> a deposit <b>from a woman, he must return it to the woman,</b> as he cannot be certain that it is not hers. <b>And if</b> the woman <b>died, he must return it to her husband,</b> as he is her heir. If one <b>accepted</b> a deposit <b>from a slave, he must return it to the slave,</b> since it might not belong to the master. <b>And if</b> the slave <b>died, he must return it to his master.</b>

Daf 52a

If one <b>accepted</b> a deposit <b>from a minor,</b> he cannot return it to him, as a minor is unable to properly safeguard the item. Instead, <b>he must make a safe investment [<i>segulla</i>] for him, and if</b> the minor <b>dies,</b> he <b>must return</b> it <b>to his heirs.</b>
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>all these</b> people, <b>who said at the time of their death</b> that the deposited item <b>belongs to so-and-so,</b> the bailee <b>should act as they</b> had <b>explained, and if</b> their explanation was <b>not</b> credible, the bailee <b>should form an explanation of their explanation,</b> i.e., ignore what they said.
The Gemara relates: <b>When the wife of Rabba bar bar Ḥana was dying she said: These rings</b> that are in my possession <b>belong to Marta and the sons of her daughter.</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>came before Rav</b> to ask what he should do. Rav <b>said to him: If she is credible in your</b> eyes, <b>act as she</b> had <b>explained, and if not, form an explanation of her explanation,</b> i.e., ignore what she said, and as her heir, keep them for yourself.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>this is what</b> Rav <b>said to him: If you assess</b> that it is likely that the rings were deposited with her, <b>act as she</b> had <b>explained, and if not, form an explanation of her explanation.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> stated that if the bailee took a deposit <b>from a minor, he must make a safe investment for him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>a safe investment? Rav Ḥisda says:</b> The bailee should purchase <b>a Torah scroll</b> for the minor. <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says:</b> He should purchase <b>a date palm, from which</b> the minor <b>will consume dates.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And a father does not have</b> the ability to establish the presumption of ownership <b>with regard to a son’s property, and a son does not have</b> the ability to establish the presumption of ownership <b>with regard to a father’s property. Rav Yosef says: Even</b> if <b>they separated</b> and the son is no longer dependent on his father, the presumption of ownership still cannot be established by a father or son with regard to the other’s property. <b>Rava says:</b> If <b>they separated,</b> that is <b>not</b> the <i>halakha</i>, and the presumption of ownership can be established.
<b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti said: Rav Pappi performed an action</b> and ruled that if <b>they separated,</b> that is <b>not</b> the <i>halakha</i>, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rava. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> that <b>Rav Ḥiyya, from</b> the city of <b>Hurmiz Ardeshid, told me that Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov told him in the name of Rav Naḥman bar Yaakov:</b> If <b>they separated,</b> that is <b>not</b> the <i>halakha</i>. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this is the <b><i>halakha</i>:</b> If <b>they separated,</b> that is <b>not</b> the <i>halakha</i>, and the presumption of ownership can be established. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A son who separated</b> himself from his father’s finances <b>and a wife who became divorced are like all other people</b> with regard to establishing the presumption of ownership.
§ It <b>was stated:</b> There was a case of <b>one of the brothers</b> in a family <b>who was engaging in commerce in the house,</b> managing the family finances after the death of their father, <b>and there were bills of sale [<i>onot</i>] and</b> other <b>documents circulating with his name</b> appearing as the owner of the property and as a lender, <b>and</b> that brother <b>said:</b> The money and property <b>are mine, as they fell to me as an inheritance from the house of</b> the <b>father of</b> my <b>mother,</b> who is not the mother of the other brothers, <b>Rav says:</b> It is <b>upon him to bring proof</b> of ownership; otherwise the property is divided equally among the brothers. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> It is <b>upon the brothers to bring proof</b> that the money or property belonged to their common father and consequently now belongs to all of them. <b>Shmuel says: Abba,</b> i.e., Rav, <b>concedes to me that if</b> that brother <b>dies,</b> it is <b>upon the brothers to bring proof</b> in order to collect money from the deceased brother’s heirs.
<b>Rav Pappa objects to</b> Shmuel’s addendum: Do <b>we claim on behalf of orphans anything that their father</b> could <b>not claim for them? But didn’t Rava remove a pair</b> of scissors used <b>for</b> cutting <b>garments and a book of <i>aggada</i> from orphans without</b> requiring the prior owner who had asked the orphans to return these items to bring <b>proof</b> of ownership, and he would rule the same <b>in</b> the case of all <b>items</b> with regard to <b>which it is common</b> for them <b>to be lent,</b> and the one in possession has no presumption of ownership?

Daf 52b

<b>As Rav Huna bar Avin sent</b> a ruling: If one other than the one previously established to be the owner is in possession of <b>items that are typically lent or rented, and says: They are purchased,</b> and that is why they are <b>in my possession, he is not deemed credible.</b> In this case as well, as the father of the orphans could not be awarded these documents without bringing proof, the same should be true of his orphans. Why, then, would Rav concede to Shmuel? The Gemara concedes: This is <b>difficult.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda says: They,</b> i.e., Rav, <b>taught</b> his ruling, that the brother must bring proof that he owns the property listed in the documents that appear under his name, <b>only when they do not divide</b> any of their property, even <b>with regard to their dough,</b> i.e., they share everything, even their food. <b>But</b> if <b>they divide with regard to their dough, say</b> that this brother <b>removed</b> money <b>from his dough,</b> i.e., reduced his expenses for food, thereby amassing his own property.
With regard to the requirement that proof be brought, the Gemara asks: <b>With what</b> is one considered to have brought <b>proof? Rabba says: Proof</b> is brought <b>with</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses</b> that he purchased the property listed in the document or granted the loan with his own money or that he inherited it from his mother’s family. <b>Rav Sheshet says: Proof</b> is brought <b>with</b> the court’s <b>ratification of the document</b> in which his name appears.
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: This</b> is the opinion of <b>Rav and this</b> is the opinion of <b>Shmuel; this</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabba and this</b> is the opinion of <b>Rav Sheshet. In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>does</b> the <b>Master hold?</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: I know a <i>baraita</i>,</b> which is the source of my opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:2): In a case where there was <b>one of the brothers who was engaging in commerce in the house,</b> managing the family finances, <b>and there were bills of sale and</b> other <b>documents circulating with his name</b> appearing as the owner of the property or as a lender, <b>and</b> that brother <b>said:</b> The money and property <b>are mine, as they fell to me as an inheritance from the house of</b> the <b>father of</b> my <b>mother,</b> who is not the mother of the other brothers, it is <b>upon him to bring proof</b> of ownership.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And similarly,</b> in the case of <b>a woman,</b> i.e., a widow, if her husband’s heirs see <b>that she is engaging in commerce in the house</b> with the property that had belonged to her husband, <b>and there were bills of sale and</b> other <b>documents circulating with her name</b> appearing on them as the owner, <b>and she said:</b> The money and property <b>are mine</b> alone, <b>as they fell to me as an inheritance from the house of</b> the <b>father of</b> my <b>father or from</b> the <b>house of</b> the <b>father of</b> my <b>mother,</b> and did not belong to my husband, it is <b>upon her to bring proof.</b> Rav Naḥman consequently holds in accordance with the opinion of Rav.
Having quoted the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara seeks to clarify it, and asks: <b>What</b> is the purpose of the clause of the <i>baraita</i> that begins: <b>And similarly,</b> where the <i>halakha</i> appears to be identical to that of the first clause? <b>Lest you say</b> that in the case of the <b>woman, since the matter is laudable for her,</b> in <b>that</b> people <b>say: She is toiling on behalf of orphans; she</b> would <b>not steal from</b> the <b>orphans,</b> and is therefore deemed credible if she says that the property in the documents that bear her name is her own, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this assumption cannot be relied upon, and she must bring proof of ownership.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that one establishes the presumption of ownership after profiting from the property for a certain duration, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>in</b> a case of one who <b>has</b> mere <b>possession</b> of the property, which does in some cases serve as proof of ownership. <b>But in</b> a case of one who <b>gives a gift, or brothers who divided</b> their inheritance, or one who takes possession of the property of a convert who died without heirs and his property is now ownerless, as soon as one locked the door of the property, or fenced it or breached its fence even a bit, this is considered taking possession of the property, and effects acquisition. The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>all of these whom we</b> previously <b>said</b> possessed the field for three years <b>are not subject to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>taking possession</b> of property in this manner?
The Gemara responds that the mishna <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to possession that is accompanied by a claim,</b> i.e., when the possessor has a claim to counter that of the claimant, <b>such as</b> where the <b>seller,</b> i.e., the claimant, <b>says: I did not sell, and the buyer,</b> i.e., the possessor, <b>says: I purchased.</b> In that case, working and profiting from the land for three years establishes the presumption of ownership.
<b>But</b> with regard to <b>possession that</b> does <b>not</b> need to be <b>accompanied by a claim,</b> as the prior owner concedes that the one in possession is the owner, <b>such as</b> a case where another person <b>gives</b> one <b>a gift, or</b> there are <b>brothers who divided</b> their property, <b>or</b> there is <b>one who takes possession of</b> the <b>property of a convert</b> who died without heirs, <b>where</b> the function of possessing the item is <b>only to acquire</b> it and not to establish the presumption of ownership, if one <b>locked</b> the door of the property, or <b>fenced</b> it or <b>breached</b> its fence even <b>a bit, this is</b> considered <b>taking possession</b> of the property.
<b>Rav Hoshaya teaches in</b> the <i>baraita</i> of tractate <b><i>Kiddushin</i></b> that was taught in the <b>school of Levi:</b> If one <b>locked</b> the door of the property, or <b>fenced</b> it or <b>breached</b> its fence even <b>a bit,</b> if this was done <b>in</b> the <b>presence</b> of the seller, <b>this is</b> considered <b>taking possession</b> of the property. The Gemara asks: One could infer that <b>in his presence, yes,</b> he acquires it; but <b>not in his presence, no,</b> he does not acquire it. Why not? In any event he has taken possession. <b>Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> is what Rav Hoshaya <b>is saying:</b> If the act was performed <b>in</b> the seller’s <b>presence,</b> the seller <b>need not say to him: Go, take possession, and</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> the property. Since the buyer is performing the act in the seller’s presence, there is no need for the seller to specify that he consents to the buyer’s acquiring it.

Daf 53a

But if the act was performed <b>not in</b> the seller’s <b>presence,</b> the seller <b>must say to him: Go, take possession and</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> the property for him to acquire it.
<b>Rav raises a dilemma: How</b> does one acquire <b>a gift,</b> i.e., is it necessary for the giver to say: Go, take possession and thereby acquire? <b>Shmuel said: What dilemma is raised to Abba,</b> i.e., Rav? <b>Now</b> one could say the following: <b>And what</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>a sale, where</b> the buyer <b>is giving money</b> to the seller? <b>If</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer: <b>Go, take possession and</b> thereby <b>acquire</b> the property, the acquisition <b>does</b> take effect, but <b>if</b> he did <b>not</b> say this, it does <b>not.</b> Therefore, with regard to <b>a gift,</b> where no money is given to the seller, is it <b>not all the more so</b> reasonable that the acquisition not take effect without a clear directive from the seller? The Gemara answers: <b>And Rav holds</b> that it is possible to say that <b>one who gives a gift gives</b> it <b>generously,</b> and would allow the acquisition even absent a clear directive.
§ The mishna teaches that taking possession can be performed by building a fence or breaching a fence even a bit. The Gemara clarifies: <b>And how much</b> is the measure of <b>a bit?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel says:</b> If one had previously <b>built a fence, and</b> now <b>completed it to</b> a height of <b>ten</b> handbreadths, which is the height of a halakhically significant barrier; <b>or</b> similarly, if one had previously <b>breached a breach,</b> and now expanded it <b>in order</b> that it be large enough <b>that</b> a person can <b>enter and exit through it, this is</b> considered <b>taking possession.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this fence? If we say that initially</b> one could <b>not climb over it</b> to enter the field, <b>and now too</b> one still could <b>not climb over it, what did he accomplish?</b> Nothing has changed through his completing the height of the fence. <b>And alternatively,</b> if it was such <b>that initially</b> one <b>could climb over it</b> to enter the field, <b>and now</b> one could <b>not climb over it,</b> he has <b>accomplished a great deal,</b> and the mishna should not have referred to this addition as: A bit. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary to</b> state this ruling if the height of the fence was such <b>that initially</b> one <b>could climb over it with ease, and now</b> one <b>could climb over it</b> only <b>with effort.</b>
The Gemara similarly asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of <b>this breach? If we say that initially,</b> one <b>could enter</b> the field <b>through it, and now too</b> one <b>could enter</b> the field <b>through it, what did</b> he <b>accomplish?</b> Nothing has changed through his expanding the breach? <b>And alternatively,</b> if it was such <b>that initially</b> one <b>could not enter</b> the field <b>through it, and now</b> one <b>could enter</b> the field <b>through it,</b> he has <b>accomplished a great deal,</b> and the mishna should not have referred to this as: A bit. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this ruling if the size of the breach was such <b>that initially</b> one <b>could enter</b> the field <b>through it with effort, and now</b> one <b>could enter</b> the field <b>through it with ease.</b>
<b>Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>placed a stone and</b> it <b>helps</b> to serve some objective, or if one <b>removed a stone and</b> it <b>helps</b> to serve some objective, <b>this</b> act <b>is</b> considered <b>taking possession.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>placed, and what</b> is the meaning of <b>removed?</b>
<b>If we say</b> that he <b>placed a stone</b> in the fence <b>and stopped the water from</b> flooding the field, or he <b>removed a stone</b> from the fence <b>and</b> thereby fashioned an opening that <b>released water</b> that had been flooding the field, <b>this</b> is analogous to one who <b>chases away a lion from another’s property.</b> In other words, these acts prevent damage to the field, which one is obligated to prevent even in the case of the property of another, and accordingly, they do not constitute a demonstration of ownership. <b>Rather,</b> it means that he <b>placed a stone that connected water to</b> the field and irrigated it, or he <b>removed a stone and enhanced</b> the flow of <b>water to it.</b>
§ The Gemara cites another statement of the same <i>amora</i> with regard to taking possession. <b>And Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If there were <b>two fields with one boundary between them,</b> and one <b>took possession of one of</b> the fields in order <b>to acquire it,</b> he has <b>acquired it.</b>

Daf 53b

If his intention was <b>to acquire it and</b> also acquire <b>the other</b> field, he has <b>acquired</b> the first field, but has <b>not acquired the other</b> field, since the fields are separated by a boundary. If he took possession of one field in order <b>to acquire</b> only <b>the other</b> field, <b>he has not acquired even that</b> field of which he took possession, since his intention when taking possession was to acquire the other field, and one does not acquire an item without the intention to do so.
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if one <b>took possession of one of</b> the fields in order <b>to acquire it, and the boundary, and the other</b> field, all together? <b>Do we say</b> that the <b>boundary of the land is one,</b> i.e., these two fields are joined by means of their common boundary, <b>and</b> therefore he has <b>acquired</b> all of them? <b>Or perhaps this</b> field <b>stands alone and that</b> field <b>stands alone.</b> The Gemara notes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rabbi Elazar raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if one <b>took possession of the boundary</b> between the two fields in order <b>to acquire both of</b> the fields? <b>Do we say</b> that the legal status of <b>this boundary</b> is that of <b>the halter of the land and he acquires</b> the fields, just as one acquires an animal through the acquisition of its halter? <b>Or perhaps</b> this field <b>stands alone and that</b> field <b>stands alone,</b> as the boundary is not connected to the field in the same manner that a halter is connected to an animal. The Gemara notes that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
Similarly, <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> If there were <b>two houses</b> in a courtyard, <b>this</b> one situated <b>within</b> the courtyard relative <b>to that</b> one, and one <b>took possession of the outer</b> house in order <b>to acquire it, he has acquired it.</b> If his intention was <b>to acquire it and</b> also acquire <b>the inner</b> house, <b>he has acquired the outer</b> house, but has <b>not acquired the inner</b> house. If he took possession of the outer house in order to <b>acquire the inner</b> house alone, he <b>has not acquired even the outer</b> house.
If he <b>took possession of the inner</b> house in order <b>to acquire it,</b> he <b>has acquired it.</b> If his intention was <b>to acquire it and</b> also acquire <b>the outer house,</b> he <b>has acquired both of them.</b> Since the residents of the inner house possess the right to pass through the outer house in order to enter and exit the courtyard, the outer house is viewed as an extension of the inner house. If he took possession of the inner house in order <b>to acquire</b> only <b>the outer</b> house, he has <b>not acquired even the inner</b> house, since he did not take possession of the property that he intended to acquire.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of taking possession of ownerless property. <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> With regard to <b>one who builds large palaces [<i>palterin</i>] on the property of a convert</b> who died without heirs, <b>and another came and placed doors</b> upon <b>them,</b> the latter <b>has acquired</b> the property. The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The first,</b> i.e., the one who built the palaces, <b>merely turned over bricks,</b> i.e., building an incomplete house is not sufficient to take possession of the property.
<b>Rav Dimi bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says: One who finds palaces</b> built <b>on the property of a convert</b> who died without heirs <b>and plastered them</b> with <b>one</b> application of <b>plaster or</b> tiled them with <b>one tile, has acquired them.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And how much,</b> i.e., what is the minimum area that must be plastered or tiled? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> A square <b>cubit. Rav Ḥisda said: And</b> he acquires it in this manner only if it was plastered or tiled <b>opposite the entrance,</b> where it can be easily seen.
<b>Rav Amram said: Rav Sheshet said this statement to us, and he enlightened our eyes from a <i>baraita</i></b> that alludes to the same matter. He said: <b>One who spreads</b> out <b>mattresses on the property of a convert</b> who died without heirs <b>has acquired</b> it. <b>And</b> that which I said, that <b>he enlightened our eyes from a <i>baraita</i>, what is it? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 1:5): <b>How</b> does one acquire a Canaanite slave <b>through taking possession?</b> If the slave <b>placed</b> one’s <b>shoe for him, or untied</b> his <b>shoe for him, or</b> if it occurred <b>that he carried his garments after him to the bathhouse, or undresses him, or bathes him,</b> or <b>anoints him,</b> or <b>scrubs</b> the oil off <b>him, or dresses him, or puts on his shoes, or lifts him,</b> one <b>acquires</b> the slave. <b>Rabbi Shimon said:</b> The acquisition generated by taking <b>possession should not be</b> considered <b>greater than</b> the acquisition generated by <b>lifting, as lifting acquires</b> property <b>in any situation.</b>
With regard to this last statement, the Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>saying</b> here, as the first <i>tanna</i> also said that a slave can be acquired by lifting? The Gemara explains: <b>This</b> is what he <b>is saying:</b> The first <i>tanna</i> holds that if <b>he lifted his master,</b> the master <b>acquires him,</b> as he is performing labor for the master, but if <b>his master lifted him,</b> the master <b>does not acquire him,</b> as the slave has not performed labor on his behalf. With regard to this <i>halakha</i>, <b>Rabbi Shimon said:</b> Acquisition generated through taking <b>possession should not be greater than</b> acquisition generated through <b>lifting, as lifting acquires</b> property <b>in any situation.</b> Consequently, one can acquire a slave even by lifting him.
<b>Rav Yirmeya Bira’a says</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>this one</b>

Daf 54a

<b>who threw turnip</b> seeds <b>in the crevices [<i>filei</i>] of the land of a convert</b> who died without heirs, it <b>is not</b> sufficient to <b>take possession. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>As at the time that</b> he <b>threw</b> the seeds <b>there was no enhancement</b> to the value of the field. <b>Now that</b> the turnips have grown and the value of the field <b>is enhanced, it is enhanced by itself.</b>
The Gemara records a series of rulings with regard to taking possession of land. <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>this one who cuts</b> the branches of <b>a palm tree,</b> if he had <b>in mind</b> the acquisition <b>of the palm tree,</b> he <b>has acquired</b> it; but if he had <b>in mind</b> the benefit <b>of the animals,</b> to feed his animals the branches, he <b>has not acquired</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which it can be known what he had in mind? The Gemara answers: If he <b>took</b> branches <b>from this side and from that side,</b> he had <b>in mind</b> the acquisition <b>of the palm tree,</b> as this assists the growth of the tree; but if the branches that he took were <b>all from one side,</b> he had <b>in mind</b> the benefit <b>of the animals.</b>
<b>And Shmuel says</b> with regard to <b>this one who clears [<i>dezakkei zikheya</i>]</b> a field of trees, if he had <b>in mind</b> the improvement <b>of the field,</b> to prepare it for plowing, <b>he has acquired</b> it; but if he had <b>in mind</b> the collection <b>of the wood, he has not acquired</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which it can be known what he had in mind? The Gemara answers: If he <b>took large and small</b> pieces of wood, he had <b>in mind</b> the improvement <b>of the field;</b> however, if <b>he took</b> the <b>large</b> pieces of wood <b>but left</b> the <b>small</b> ones, he had <b>in mind</b> the collection <b>of the wood.</b>
<b>And Shmuel says</b> with regard to <b>this one who removes protuberances</b> and levels the ground, if he had <b>in mind</b> the improvement <b>of the field,</b> to prepare it for plowing, he <b>has acquired</b> it; but if he had <b>in mind</b> the conversion <b>of</b> the field into <b>a threshing floor, he has not acquired</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which it can be known what he had in mind? The Gemara answers: If he <b>took a mound and threw it in a ditch,</b> thereby leveling both areas, he had <b>in mind</b> the improvement <b>of the field;</b> but if he leveled the ground with <b>a mound in</b> the place of <b>a mound and a ditch in</b> the place of <b>a ditch,</b> expanding each area but leaving the field as a whole uneven, he had <b>in mind</b> the conversion <b>of</b> the field into <b>a threshing floor.</b>
<b>And Shmuel says</b> with regard to <b>this one who opened</b> a blockage and enabled <b>water</b> to enter <b>into</b> a section of <b>land,</b> if he had <b>in mind</b> the improvement <b>of the field,</b> to irrigate it, he <b>has acquired</b> it; but if he had <b>in mind</b> the catching <b>of the fish,</b> i.e., to enable the water to flow in so that he could catch the fish therein, he <b>has not acquired</b> it. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which it can be known what he had in mind? The Gemara answers: If he <b>opened two gates, one bringing in</b> the water <b>and one taking out</b> the water, this indicates that he had <b>in mind</b> the catching <b>of the fish,</b> as the water will flow out of the field, giving him the means to catch the fish; but if he opened only <b>one gate,</b> this indicates that he had <b>in mind</b> the improvement <b>of the field.</b>
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain woman who profited</b> from an ownerless <b>palm tree by cutting</b> its branches for <b>thirteen years. Another</b> then <b>came</b> and <b>plowed beneath it a bit.</b> The case <b>came before Levi, and some say</b> that it came <b>before Mar Ukva,</b> who <b>established</b> the property <b>in</b> the <b>possession</b> of the one who plowed. The woman <b>came</b> and <b>shouted before him,</b> protesting the perceived injustice of his ruling. Mar Ukva <b>said to her: What can I do for you, as you did not take possession</b> of the property <b>in the manner that people take possession?</b>
<b>Rav says: One who draws an image,</b> e.g., he paints an image on the wall, <b>on the property of a convert</b> who died without heirs <b>has acquired</b> it, <b>as Rav</b> himself <b>acquired the garden of the house</b> of <b>Rav,</b> which had been ownerless property, <b>only by</b> drawing <b>an image.</b>
§ <b>It was stated:</b> With regard to <b>a field</b> that is <b>defined by its boundaries,</b> i.e., it has clearly demarcated boundaries on all sides, <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: Once he struck</b> the land with a hoe <b>one</b> time, he <b>acquired the entire</b> property. <b>And Shmuel says</b> that he <b>has acquired only the place</b> that <b>he struck</b> with the hoe.

Daf 54b

<b>And if it is not defined by its boundaries, up to how much</b> of the field is acquired by one strike of the hoe? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> He acquires as far <b>as an ox driver goes and returns,</b> i.e., the size of a standard furrow, beginning where the hoe entered the ground.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to the <b>property of a gentile</b> that was sold to a Jew for money, <b>it is</b> ownerless <b>like a desert</b> until the purchaser performs an act of acquisition; <b>anyone who takes possession of it</b> in the interim has <b>acquired it. What is the reason</b> for this? The <b>gentile relinquishes</b> ownership of it <b>from</b> the moment <b>when</b> the <b>money reaches his hand,</b> while the <b>Jew</b> who purchased it <b>does not acquire</b> it <b>until the deed reaches his hand. Therefore,</b> in the period of time between the giving of the money and the receiving of the deed, the property <b>is like a desert, and anyone who takes possession of it</b> has <b>acquired it.</b>
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say this? But doesn’t Shmuel say</b> that <b>the law of the kingdom is the law,</b> i.e., the <i>halakha</i> obligates Jews to observe the laws of the locale in which they reside, <b>and the king said</b> that <b>land may not be acquired without a document?</b> Therefore, taking possession should not be effective for acquisition. Rav Yosef <b>said to him: I do not know</b> how to reconcile this contradiction, but <b>there was an incident in</b> the village of <b>Dura that</b> was founded by <b>shepherds, where</b> there was <b>a Jew who purchased land from a gentile</b> by giving money, <b>and</b> in the interim <b>another Jew came</b> and <b>plowed it a bit.</b> The two Jews <b>came before Rav Yehuda</b> for a ruling, and he <b>established</b> the property <b>in the possession of the second</b> individual. This accords with the ruling of Shmuel that the property is ownerless until a Jew performs an act of acquisition.
Abaye <b>said to him: Are you saying</b> that the incident occurred in <b>Dura that</b> was founded by <b>shepherds?</b> Proof cannot be brought from that case, as <b>there</b> the <b>fields were concealed, since</b> the owners of fields <b>would not pay the land tax [<i>taska</i>] to the king, and the king says</b> that <b>one who pays land tax</b> may <b>profit</b> from <b>the field.</b> Therefore, in that case, the gentile who sold the property did not actually own it, and consequently by the laws of the kingdom could not sell it. The one who took possession of the property acquired it in accordance with the law of the kingdom, as he committed to pay the land tax. Elsewhere, one would not acquire the field until he received a deed of sale from the gentile.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Huna purchased land from a gentile. Another Jew came and plowed it slightly.</b> Rav Huna and that Jew <b>came before Rav Naḥman,</b> who <b>established</b> the property <b>in the possession</b> of the latter. Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>What are you thinking</b> in issuing this ruling? Is it <b>because Shmuel says</b> that <b>the property of a gentile is like a desert, and anyone who takes possession of it</b> has <b>acquired it?</b>

Daf 55a

If so, <b>the Master should do for me in accordance with another</b> statement <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel says</b> that one who hoes ownerless property <b>has acquired only the place that he struck</b> with the hoe. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: In this</b> matter <b>I hold in accordance with our <i>halakha</i>, as Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: Once he struck</b> the land with a hoe <b>one</b> time, he <b>acquired the entire</b> property.
The Gemara relates that <b>Rav Huna bar Avin sent</b> a ruling: In the case of <b>a Jew who purchased a field from a gentile, and</b> then <b>another Jew came and took possession of it, it is not removed from</b> the <b>possession of</b> the second Jew. <b>And so too, Rabbi Avin, and Rabbi Ile’a, and all of our Rabbis agree with regard to</b> this <b>matter.</b>
§ <b>Rabba said: These three statements were told to me</b> by <b>Ukvan bar Neḥemya the Exilarch in the name of Shmuel: The law of the kingdom is the law; and</b> the term of <b>Persian sharecropping [<i>arisuta</i>]</b> is for <b>up to forty years,</b> since according to Persian laws the presumption of ownership is established after forty years of use; <b>and</b> in the case of <b>these tax officials [<i>zaharurei</i>] who sold land</b> in order <b>to</b> pay the <b>land tax, the sale is valid,</b> as the tax officials were justified in seizing it, and one may purchase the land from them.
The Gemara notes: <b>And this statement</b> applies to land seized <b>to</b> pay the <b>land tax, but not</b> to land seized <b>to</b> pay the <b>head tax. What is the reason</b> for this? The <b>head tax is placed on a man’s head,</b> i.e., the obligation of this tax is on the individual and is unrelated to his property. It is therefore theft for the tax officials to sell land for this purpose. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> Everything, <b>even</b> the <b>barley in the pitcher, is mortgaged for</b> the payment of the <b>head tax.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said: Huna bar Natan said to me</b> that <b>Ameimar raised a difficulty with regard to this</b> statement of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: <b>If so, you have abolished the inheritance of the firstborn son</b> of one who owes taxes to the kingdom. If everything can be seized by the tax collectors to pay the father’s debt, any property that he left behind <b>is</b> only <b>a potential</b> inheritance, not actually property of the heirs, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>the firstborn does not take</b> a double share <b>in a potential</b> inheritance <b>as</b> he does <b>in</b> property that the deceased <b>possessed.</b>
The Gemara continues the statement of Huna bar Natan: And <b>I said to</b> Ameimar: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that this presents a difficulty, then <b>even</b> if the property can be seized as payment for the <b>land tax</b> this difficulty would present itself <b>as well,</b> as the sons would not inherit their father’s estate in the event that it is seized to pay the land tax. <b>Rather, what have you to say</b> to deflect this question? That the firstborn son’s right is not negated in a case <b>where</b> the father <b>gave</b> the <b>land tax and</b> then <b>died,</b> so that he is no longer indebted to the government and the field is completely his. <b>Here too,</b> the firstborn son maintains his rights in a case <b>where</b> the father <b>gave</b> the <b>head tax and</b> then <b>died.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said: Huna bar Natan said to me: I asked</b> the <b>scribes</b> who wrote documents and recorded halakhic rulings in the court <b>of Rava, and they said to me</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> who states that one’s possessions are all mortgaged for the payment of the head tax. The Gemara notes: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so,</b> as <b>there,</b> Huna bar Natan <b>said</b> that in order <b>to buttress his</b> previous <b>statement.</b>
<b>And Rav Ashi said: An idler [<i>pardakht</i>]</b> must <b>assist the town</b> by paying taxes even though he has no income in that town. <b>And this matter</b> applies in a case <b>where the town saved him</b> from his obligation by asking for a reduction on his behalf. <b>But</b> if the <b>tax collectors [<i>andisekei</i>]</b> do not seek to collect his debt this <b>is</b> regarded as <b>heavenly assistance,</b> and he is not obligated to volunteer to pay his share.
§ <b>Rav Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The boundary</b> between fields <b>and the sea squill</b> that was planted to demarcate the border between fields <b>serve as a barrier</b> between fields <b>with regard to the property of a convert</b> who died without heirs, so that one who takes possession of the property acquires land only until the boundary or the sea squill, but not other land the convert had possessed beyond that point. <b>But</b> they do <b>not</b> serve as a barrier between fields <b>with regard to the matter of produce in the corner of the field, which is given to the poor [<i>pe’a</i>], and ritual impurity,</b> and even the area beyond it is considered to be part of the same field. <b>When Ravin came</b> to Babylonia from Eretz Yisrael, he <b>said</b> in the name of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> They serve as a barrier between the fields <b>even with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b><i>pe’a</i> and ritual impurity.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b><i>pe’a</i></b> that is affected by determining whether it is one or two fields? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 2:1): <b>And these serve as a barrier for</b> the purpose of <b><i>pe’a</i>,</b> i.e., the presence of any of these divides a field so that each section constitutes a distinct field from which <i>pe’a</i> must be given independently: <b>A stream</b> that passes through the field; <b>and a canal;</b>

Daf 55b

<b>and a public road</b> that is at least sixteen cubits wide; <b>and a private road</b> that is four cubits wide; <b>and a public trail; and a permanent private trail</b> that is used <b>whether in the summer or in the rainy season,</b> i.e., winter. Rav Asi and Ravin disagree with regard to whether Rabbi Yoḥanan held that a boundary or sea squill also serves to subdivide a field for the purpose of <i>pe’a</i>.
The Gemara further clarifies: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>ritual impurity</b> that is affected by determining whether an area is one or two fields? <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 6:5): With regard to <b>one who enters into a valley during the rainy season,</b> i.e., winter, when people generally do not enter this area, and therefore for the purpose of this <i>halakha</i> it is considered a private domain, and there is a principle that in a case of uncertainty concerning whether one contracted ritual impurity in a private domain he is ritually impure; <b>and</b> there was <b>ritual impurity in such and such a field, and</b> he <b>said:</b> I know <b>I walked to that place,</b> i.e., I walked in the valley, <b>but I do not know whether I entered that place</b> where the ritual impurity was <b>or whether I did not</b> enter, <b>Rabbi Eliezer deems him pure and the Rabbis deem him impure.</b>
Rabbi Eliezer deems him pure, <b>as Rabbi Eliezer would say:</b> Concerning <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>entry,</b> i.e., it is uncertain whether he entered the area where the ritual impurity is located, he is <b>ritually pure.</b> But if he certainly entered the area where the ritual impurity is located and the <b>uncertainty</b> is with regard to <b>contact</b> with <b>ritual impurity,</b> he is <b>ritually impure.</b> It is with regard to this <i>halakha</i> that Ravin said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan that a boundary or sea squill defines these fields as distinct areas.
The Gemara infers, though, that even Ravin holds that a boundary or sea squill serves as a barrier only with regard to <i>pe’a</i> and ritual impurity, <b>but with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat,</b> they do <b>not</b> serve as a barrier between fields.
<b>Rava says:</b> They serve as a barrier between fields <b>even with regard to the matter of Shabbat, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who <b>carried out half</b> of <b>a dried fig</b> from a private domain <b>into the public domain and placed it</b> there, <b>and</b> then <b>returned and carried out another half</b> of <b>a dried fig,</b> if it was done <b>within one lapse of awareness,</b> i.e., he did not remember in the interim that this act is prohibited or that it was Shabbat, the two acts are considered as one, and since the two items together equal the size of a dried fig, he is <b>liable</b> to bring a sin-offering. But if it was done <b>within two lapses</b> of awareness, i.e., after he carried out the first half of a dried fig he remembered that this act is prohibited or that it was Shabbat, but subsequently forgot again and carried out the second half of a dried fig, he is <b>exempt.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> If it was done <b>within one lapse of awareness,</b>

Daf 56a

and <b>in one domain,</b> i.e., he carried half the dried fig into the same public domain each time, he is <b>liable,</b> but if it was <b>in two domains,</b> i.e., he carried the item into two separate public domains, he is <b>exempt.</b>
<b>And Rabba says</b> in explanation of Rabbi Yosei’s opinion: <b>And this</b> division of the public domain applies only <b>where there is</b> a property where one would incur <b>liability</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering</b> if one unintentionally carried out of it or into it, i.e., a private domain, <b>between</b> the two sections. <b>But</b> if there was only <b>a <i>karmelit</i>,</b> i.e., an area that is not defined as either a private domain or public domain and to and from which the prohibition against carrying is only of rabbinic origin, it does <b>not</b> divide the public domain. <b>Abaye says: Even a <i>karmelit</i></b> divides the public domain into separate sections, <b>but a beam [<i>pisela</i>]</b> does <b>not. Rava says: Even a beam</b> divides the public domain, since it is no less than a boundary or sea squill, which do serve as a barrier between fields.
The Gemara notes: <b>And Rava follows his</b> own line of <b>reasoning, as Rava says:</b> The definition of <b>a domain</b> for the purpose of <b>Shabbat is like</b> the definition of <b>a domain</b> for the purpose of <b>bills of divorce:</b> Just as a beam is defined as a distinct domain for the purpose of bills of divorce, so too it is considered a distinct domain for the purpose of Shabbat.
The Gemara returns to discuss the acquisition of a field that belonged to a convert who died without heirs. The Gemara asks: If <b>there was no boundary and</b> there was <b>no sea squill, what</b> are the limits to the acquisition? <b>Rabbi Marinus explains in the name</b> of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>Any</b> area <b>that is called by his name.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> where it is called by his name? <b>Rav Pappa said: Where it is called: The place</b> that is irrigated by <b>so-and-so’s well.</b> The entire area referred to as such would be considered one section with regard to acquisition.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Avya sat before Rabbi Asi, and he sat and was saying</b> the following <b>in the name of Rabbi Asi bar Ḥanina:</b> A row of <b>sea squill serves as a barrier with regard to the property of a convert</b> who died without heirs, so that each section is considered a distinct field.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is <b>sea squill? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It is the growth <b>by which Joshua established the boundaries of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>for the Jews.</b>
The Gemara teaches a related statement. <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> In his book, <b>Joshua enumerated only the towns that stand upon the borders,</b> but not the towns that were within the portions of each tribe.
On the subject of the boundaries of Eretz Yisrael, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Any</b> area <b>that the Holy One, Blessed be He, showed to Moses</b> before his death, as it is written: “And the Lord showed him all the land, Gilead…as far as Zoar” (Deuteronomy 34:1–3), is within the boundaries of Eretz Yisrael, and therefore produce that grows there is <b>obligated in tithe.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>To exclude what</b> area? The Gemara answers: <b>To exclude</b> the lands of the <b>Kenite, Kenizzite, and Kadmonite,</b> as God had promised to Abraham at the Covenant between the Pieces: “To your offspring have I given this land…to…the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite” (Genesis 15:18–19). These areas are not obligated in tithe. What are these three areas? It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> They are <b>Naftuḥa, Arva’a, and Shalma’a. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> They are <b>Mount Seir, Ammon, and Moab. Rabbi Shimon says:</b> They are <b>Ardisekis, Asya, and Aspamya.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>there were two</b> witnesses <b>testifying on his behalf that</b> he, the possessor of the land, worked and <b>profited</b> from a field for <b>three years,</b> and therefore has presumptive ownership, <b>and they were found</b> to be <b>conspiring</b> witnesses, as it was proven that they were not present to witness the matter about which they had testified, they must <b>pay</b> the true owner of the field <b>the full</b> value of the field that they attempted, through their testimony, to remove from his possession, as it is written in the Torah: “Then shall you do to him, as he had planned to do to his brother” (Deuteronomy 19:19). If <b>two</b> witnesses testify that he worked and profited from the field <b>during the first</b> year, another <b>two</b> testify that he worked and profited from it <b>during the second</b> year, <b>and</b> another <b>two</b> testify that he worked and profited from it <b>during the third,</b> and all were found to be conspiring witnesses,

Daf 56b

payment of the value of the field to the owner is <b>divided among them.</b>
If the testimony was given by <b>three brothers,</b> each of whom testify about one year, <b>and another</b> unrelated individual <b>joined with</b> each of the brothers as the second witness, <b>these are three</b> distinct <b>testimonies</b> and they are accepted by the court. If they were to be considered one testimony, it would not be accepted, as brothers may not testify together. <b>But they are one testimony for</b> the purpose of rendering them as <b>conspiring</b> witnesses, and the payment is divided among them.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara notes: <b>The mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, 2:10) that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: When Abba Ḥalafta,</b> Rabbi Yosei’s father, <b>went to Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri to study Torah, and some say:</b> When <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Nuri</b> went <b>to Abba Ḥalafta to study Torah, he said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>there is</b> one <b>who</b> worked and <b>profited</b> from a field <b>in the presence of two</b> witnesses during the <b>first year,</b> then <b>in the presence of two</b> other witnesses during the <b>second</b> year, and finally <b>in the presence of two</b> other witnesses during the <b>third</b> year? He <b>said to him: This is</b> sufficient for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.
The latter <b>said to him: I say this as well, but Rabbi Akiva disagrees with regard to this matter, as Rabbi Akiva would say</b> that since the verse states: “At the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15), one can derive that testimony is accepted only with regard to a complete <b>matter, and not</b> with regard to <b>half</b> of <b>a matter.</b> In this mishna, although presumptive ownership requires testimony that the property had been worked and profited from for three years, testimony is accepted from each pair of witnesses with regard to one year. Consequently, the ruling of the mishna does not accord with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the Rabbis,</b> who accept the testimony of each of the three pairs of witnesses, <b>what do they do with this</b> derivation of: A complete <b>matter, and not half</b> of <b>a matter,</b> i.e., what type of testimony is disqualified based on this derivation? <b>If we say</b> that it serves <b>to exclude</b> a case where two witnesses testify that a young woman has two pubic hairs and has therefore reached maturity, where <b>one says</b> she has <b>one</b> hair <b>on her back and one says</b> she has <b>one</b> hair <b>on her</b> lower <b>abdomen,</b> i.e., they are testifying to two different pubic hairs, and in this case the Rabbis say this testimony is not accepted, since they each testify with regard to only half of the matter, that is difficult. But <b>this is</b> both <b>half</b> of <b>a matter and half</b> of <b>a testimony,</b> as there is only one witness with regard to each pubic hair. This testimony would not be valid even without the derivation.
<b>Rather,</b> in the opinion of the Rabbis the derivation serves <b>to exclude</b> a case where <b>two</b> witnesses <b>say</b> she has <b>one</b> hair <b>on her back and two</b> witnesses <b>say</b> she has <b>one</b> hair <b>on her</b> lower <b>abdomen.</b> In this case, each group of witnesses gives full testimony with regard to half of a matter, i.e., one pubic hair, as both hairs must be present concurrently in order for her to assume the status of an adult. By contrast, in the case of the mishna, the years are by definition not concurrent. Therefore, the Rabbis rule that testimony with regard to one year is accepted.
§ In a related matter, <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> If two witnesses testify that one had worked and profited from a field for three years, where <b>one</b> witness <b>says he consumed wheat</b> from the field, <b>and one says he consumed barley</b> from <b>it, this is</b> sufficient for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>Rav Naḥman objects to this</b> ruling: <b>If that is so,</b> then if <b>one</b> witness <b>says</b> he worked and <b>profited</b> from the field during the <b>first, third, and fifth</b> years; <b>and one</b> witness <b>says he</b> worked and <b>profited</b> from <b>it</b> during the <b>second, fourth, and sixth</b> years, would you <b>also</b> say <b>that</b> this <b>is</b> sufficient for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of ownership? What is the difference between testifying about different crops and testifying about different years?
<b>Rav Yehuda said to him: How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> i.e., in your example, <b>with regard to the year</b> about which one <b>Master,</b> i.e., witness, <b>is testifying,</b> the other <b>Master is not testifying</b> about it, while <b>here, both are testifying with regard to one year. What is there to say,</b> that there is a contradiction in their testimonies <b>between wheat and barley? It does not enter people’s minds</b> to note this distinction. Two witnesses did, however, testify that he worked and profited from the field for three years.
§ The mishna teaches that if the testimony was given by <b>three brothers,</b> each of whom testified about one year, <b>and another,</b> unrelated individual <b>joined with</b> each of the brothers as the second witness, <b>these are three</b> distinct <b>testimonies</b> and they are accepted by the court. <b>But they are one testimony for</b> the purpose of rendering them as <b>conspiring</b> witnesses.

Daf 57a

The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain document that had the signatures of two</b> individuals <b>on it. One of</b> the signatory witnesses <b>died,</b> and when the court sought to ratify the document, which requires either that the witnesses personally attest to the validity of their signatures or that two other witnesses attest to the validity of the signatures, <b>the brother of the</b> witness <b>who remained</b> alive <b>and one other</b> individual <b>came to testify with regard to the signature of the other,</b> deceased, witness, while the living witness attested to his own signature.
<b>Ravina thought to say</b> that this case <b>is</b> the same as the <i>halakha</i> in <b>the mishna,</b> which states that if testimony was given by <b>three brothers,</b> each of whom testify about one year, <b>and another,</b> unrelated individual <b>joined with</b> each of the brothers as the second witness, these are considered to be three distinct testimonies. Similarly, in this case, one brother attests to his own signature, while the other brother attests to the signature of the deceased witness.
<b>Rav Ashi said to him: Are</b> these cases <b>comparable? There, the property less one-quarter,</b> i.e., three-quarters of the property in question, <b>is not removed</b> from the possession of the prior owner based <b>upon the mouth,</b> i.e., the testimony, <b>of brothers.</b> Each brother provides only half of the testimony for each year about which he testifies. <b>Here, the property less one-quarter is removed</b> from the possession of the debtor detailed in the document based <b>upon the mouth of brothers.</b> One brother attests to his own signature, which constitutes half of the testimony, while the other signature is authenticated by the testimony of the other brother and another individual. It follows that three-quarters of the testimony is given by brothers, and it is therefore invalid.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>These are</b> uses of property <b>that have</b> the means to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership, <b>and these are</b> uses of property <b>that do not have</b> the means to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership: If one <b>would stand an animal in a courtyard;</b> or if one would place <b>an oven, a millstone, or a stove</b> there; <b>or</b> if one <b>raises chickens</b> in a courtyard, <b>or places his fertilizer in a courtyard,</b> these actions <b>are not</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership. <b>But</b> if one <b>constructed a partition ten handbreadths high to</b> contain <b>his animal, and similarly</b> if he constructed a partition <b>for</b> his <b>oven, and similarly</b> if he constructed a partition <b>for</b> his <b>stove, and similarly</b> if he constructed a partition <b>for</b> his <b>millstone;</b> or if one <b>brought chickens into the house, or</b> if he <b>fashioned a place</b> in the ground <b>for his fertilizer</b> that is <b>three</b> handbreadths <b>deep or three</b> handbreadths <b>high,</b> these actions <b>are</b> sufficient to establish the <b>presumption</b> of ownership.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in <b>the first clause,</b> where having an animal stand in a courtyard is insufficient to establish the presumption of ownership, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> where constructing a partition is sufficient to establish the presumption of ownership?
<b>Ulla says:</b> With regard to <b>any</b> act <b>which, if</b> one <b>were</b> to perform it <b>on</b> ownerless property such as the <b>property of a convert</b> who dies without heirs he would <b>acquire</b> that property, that same act is sufficient for him to <b>acquire the property of another</b> if he performed it over the course of three years, provided it is accompanied by the claim that the property had been purchased. Conversely, <b>any</b> act <b>that if</b> one <b>were</b> to perform it <b>on</b> the <b>property of a convert</b> who died without heirs he would <b>not acquire</b> that property, that same act is sufficient for him to <b>acquire the property of another.</b> Taking possession of ownerless property requires an act to be done with regard to the property itself, such as constructing a partition, but merely having an animal stand there is not sufficient. Therefore, it does not establish the presumption of ownership.
<b>Rav Sheshet objects to this</b> explanation: <b>And is</b> this an established <b>principle? But there is plowing, which,</b> if performed <b>on</b> the <b>property of a convert</b> who died without heirs one <b>acquires</b> it, but if performed <b>on</b> the <b>property of another</b> one does <b>not acquire</b> it. <b>And</b> additionally, <b>there is consumption of produce</b> for the duration of three years, <b>which,</b> if performed <b>on</b> the <b>property of another</b> one <b>acquires</b> it by establishing the presumption of ownership, but if performed <b>on</b> the <b>property of a convert</b> who died without heirs one does <b>not acquire</b> it. These cases contradict Ulla’s claim that the modes of acquisition are analogous.
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said:</b>

Daf 57b

<b>Here we are dealing with a courtyard belonging to partners, where they are not particular with regard to the mere placing</b> of items in the courtyard, but <b>are particular with regard to</b> the construction of <b>a partition.</b> The presumption of ownership is established only where the lack of a protest indicates that the prior owner concedes that the property is no longer his. The co-owner’s silence in the face of his partner using the courtyard for a temporary purpose does not indicate a concession, but silence in the face of one who constructed a partition is a concession.
The Gemara asks: <b>And are</b> they <b>not particular with regard to the mere placing</b> of items? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 45b): <b>Partners who through vows prohibited</b> themselves <b>from deriving benefit from one another are forbidden to enter into a courtyard</b> jointly owned by them, since each one has a portion in it, and it would be considered a violation of one’s vow if one were to benefit from any part of the other’s property? This indicates that partners are particular even with regard to passage through the field; all the more so are they particular with regard to placing animals or vessels in the field.
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh said: Here we are dealing with</b> a fenced-in <b>yard</b> located <b>behind</b> a group of <b>houses</b> that is used to store items not in regular use, <b>where they are not par-ticular with regard to the mere placing</b> of items <b>but are particular with regard to</b> the construction of <b>a partition.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa said: This and that,</b> i.e., the rulings of the mishna in tractate <i>Nedarim</i> as well as the rulings of the mishna here, are stated <b>with regard to a courtyard belonging to partners, and</b> the reason for the difference in the rulings is that <b>there are those who are particular</b> with regard to the other partner placing items in or passing through the courtyard, <b>and there are those who are not particular.</b> Therefore, in the mishna here, which issues a ruling <b>concerning monetary matters,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to</b> be <b>lenient,</b> and it is assumed that the partner is not particular about placing items in the courtyard, and the presumption of ownership is established. In the mishna in tractate <i>Nedarim</i>, which issues a ruling <b>concerning ritual matters,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>to</b> be <b>stringent,</b> to prevent one from violating a vow.
<b>Ravina said: Actually,</b> partners <b>are not particular</b> about placing items in the courtyard, <b>and</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna in tractate <i>Nedarim</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: Even</b> negligible benefits ordinarily <b>waived</b> are <b>forbidden in</b> the case of <b>one prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit</b> from another. In other words, one prohibited by a vow may not derive any benefit from the other, even a benefit that people commonly are not particular about and allow others to enjoy without first receiving permission. Therefore, although people are ordinarily not particular about others passing through their property, according to the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, one who is prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from his partner is prohibited from walking on the property.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Bena’a: Partners may prevent each other</b> from using their courtyard <b>for any</b> purpose <b>except for</b> washing <b>laundry.</b> This is <b>because it is not the way of Jewish women to be degraded over</b> washing <b>laundry</b> by laundering their clothing in a public area. Therefore, they must be allowed to launder in the courtyard.
In connection with the matter of laundry being washed in public, the Gemara quotes the homiletic interpretation of a verse: “He that walks righteously, and speaks uprightly; he that despises the gain of oppressions, that shakes his hands from holding of bribes, that stops his ears from hearing of blood, <b>and shuts his eyes from looking upon evil”</b> (Isaiah 33:15). <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says: This</b> is referring to one <b>who does not gaze at women while they are standing over the laundry,</b> as it was common for them to stand in the water and raise the hems of their garments while laundering their clothing.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where there is another way</b> by which the one walking could reach his destination, then one who walks past the women, consequently placing himself in a situation where he will be tempted to gaze at them, <b>is wicked.</b> Alternatively, <b>if</b> it is referring to a case <b>where there is no other way</b> by which he can reach his destination, then <b>he</b> is <b>a victim of circumstance,</b> so why is he required to shut his eyes? The Gemara explains: <b>Actually,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where there is no other way</b> by which he can reach his destination, <b>and even so, he is required to compel himself</b> to avoid gazing at the women.
§ The Gemara quotes additional matters that Rabbi Yoḥanan learned from Rabbi Bena’a. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan asked Rabbi Bena’a: How</b> should <b>the garment of a Torah scholar</b> worn under his clothes be fashioned? He replied: He can wear <b>any</b> garment long enough <b>that his flesh is not visible from beneath it.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan asked: <b>How</b> should <b>the cloak of a Torah scholar</b> be fashioned? He replied: He can wear <b>any</b> garment long enough <b>that a handbreadth of his garment</b> worn under his clothes <b>is not visible from beneath it.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan asked: <b>How</b> should <b>the table of a Torah scholar</b> appear? He replied: <b>Two-thirds</b> of the table is covered with <b>a cloth, and one-third</b> is <b>uncovered, and upon</b> that third are <b>dishes and vegetables. And its ring,</b> used to hang the table, should be positioned <b>on the outside,</b> not on the side that faces the one who is eating.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>its ring</b> should be positioned <b>on the inside?</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that its ring should be positioned on the outside, is referring to a case <b>where there is a child</b> who may play with the ring and overturn the table, while <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that its ring should be positioned on the inside, is referring to a case <b>where there is no child</b> present.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that both <b>this and that</b> refer to a case <b>where there is no child</b> present, <b>and</b> this is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that its ring should be positioned on the inside, is referring to a case <b>where there is an attendant</b> who may bump into the ring, while <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that its ring should be positioned on the outside, is referring to a case <b>where there is no attendant.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that both <b>this and that</b> refer to a case <b>where there is an attendant, and</b> this is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that its ring should be positioned on the outside, is referring to when the meal is eaten <b>during the day,</b> when the attendant can see the ring and avoid it, while <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that its ring should be positioned on the inside, is referring to when the meal is eaten <b>during the night.</b>
The Gemara continues: All of the above is referring to the table of a Torah scholar, <b>but</b> the table <b>of an ignoramus is similar</b>

Daf 58a

<b>to a bonfire,</b> where the fire is in the center <b>and pots surround it.</b> Similarly, the table of an ignoramus is arranged with the food in the center and is surrounded by plates.
Rabbi Yoḥanan asked: <b>How</b> should <b>the bed of Torah scholars</b> be kept? He replied: It is acceptable <b>as long as there</b> is <b>nothing except sandals beneath it during the summer, and shoes</b> beneath it <b>during the rainy season,</b> i.e., winter. <b>And</b> the bed <b>of an ignoramus</b> is <b>similar to a cluttered [<i>balus</i>] storehouse,</b> as he keeps a wide array of items beneath it.
§ Having mentioned Rabbi Bena’a, the Gemara relates an incident in which he was involved. <b>Rabbi Bena’a was marking</b> burial <b>caves</b> for the purpose of helping to prevent the contracting of ritual impurity. <b>When he arrived at the cave of Abraham,</b> i.e., the Cave of Machpelah, <b>he encountered Eliezer,</b> the <b>servant</b> of <b>Abraham, who was standing before the entrance.</b> Rabbi Bena’a <b>said to him: What is Abraham doing</b> at this moment? Eliezer <b>said to him:</b> He is <b>lying in the arms of Sarah, and she is examining his head.</b>
Rabbi Bena’a <b>said to him: Go tell him</b> that <b>Bena’a is standing at the entrance,</b> so that he should assume an appropriate position to receive a visitor. Eliezer <b>said to him: Let</b> him, i.e., Rabbi Bena’a, <b>enter,</b> since <b>it is known that there is no</b> evil <b>inclination in this</b> higher <b>world,</b> so it is not inappropriate for Rabbi Bena’a to see Abraham and Sarah in this position. He <b>entered, examined</b> the cave in order to measure it, <b>and exited.</b>
<b>When he arrived at the cave of Adam the first</b> man, who is buried in the same area, <b>a Divine Voice emerged and said: You gazed upon the likeness of My image,</b> i.e., Abraham, who is similar to the image of Adam the first man. <b>Do not gaze upon My image itself,</b> i.e., Adam the first man, about whom the verse states that he was formed in the image of God (see Genesis 1:27). Rabbi Bena’a said: <b>But I need to mark the cave.</b> The voice said to him: <b>As</b> the measurements of the <b>dimensions of the outer</b> cave where Abraham is buried, <b>so</b> are the measurements of the <b>dimensions of the inner</b> cave, where Adam is buried. The Gemara notes: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that the Cave of Machpelah consists of <b>two chambers, this</b> one <b>above that</b> one, not two adjacent chambers, the voice said: <b>As</b> the measurements of the <b>dimensions of the upper</b> cave where Abraham is buried, <b>so</b> are the measurements of the <b>dimensions of the lower</b> cave. Therefore, there is no need to measure it.
<b>Rabbi Bena’a says: I gazed at his,</b> Adam’s, <b>two heels, and</b> they shone so brightly that <b>they are similar to two suns.</b> Along these lines, the Gemara states that <b>all</b> people <b>compared to Sarah</b> are <b>like a monkey compared to a human,</b> as Sarah was exceedingly beautiful; <b>Sarah compared to Eve</b> is <b>like a monkey compared to a human; Eve compared to Adam</b> is <b>like a monkey compared to a human;</b> and <b>Adam compared to the Divine Presence</b> is <b>like a monkey compared to a human.</b>
It was also stated that <b>the beauty of Rav Kahana is a semblance of the beauty of Rav. The beauty of Rav is a semblance of the beauty of Rabbi Abbahu. The beauty of Rabbi Abbahu is a semblance of the beauty of Jacob our forefather. The beauty of Jacob our forefather is a semblance of the beauty of Adam the first</b> man.
On the topic of burial caves, the Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain magus [<i>amgusha</i>] who was rummaging</b> through the graves of the <b>dead. When</b> he <b>arrived at the</b> burial <b>cave of Rav Tovi bar Mattana,</b> Rav Tovi <b>grabbed him by his beard</b> and would not release him. <b>Abaye came and said to</b> Rav Tovi: <b>I beg of you</b> to <b>release him.</b> The magus <b>came again in another year,</b> and Rav Tovi <b>grabbed him by his beard. Abaye came</b> and requested that he release him, but Rav Tovi <b>did not release him, until</b> Abaye <b>brought a scissors and cut his beard.</b>
§ The Gemara relates additional incidents involving Rabbi Bena’a: There was <b>a certain</b> individual <b>who said to</b> his family before he died: <b>A barrel of earth to one of my sons, a barrel of bones to one of my sons,</b> and <b>a barrel of wads</b> of wool <b>to one of my sons. They did not know what he was saying to them. They came before Rabbi Bena’a</b> for guidance. Rabbi Bena’a <b>said to them: Do you have land</b> that your father left as an inheritance? <b>They said to him: Yes.</b> He asked: <b>Do you have livestock</b> that your father left as an inheritance? They said: <b>Yes.</b> He asked: <b>Do you have quilts [<i>bistarkei</i>]</b> that your father left as an inheritance? They said: <b>Yes.</b> He said to them: <b>If so, this is what he said to you,</b> i.e., he meant that he is bequeathing land to one son, livestock to the second, and quilts to the third.
There was <b>a certain man who heard his wife saying to her daughter: Why do you not act clandestinely</b> when you engage <b>in forbidden</b> sexual intercourse? <b>That woman has,</b> i.e., I have, <b>ten sons, and I have only one from your father,</b> and no one knows. So too, you must be careful so that no one will discover your illicit behavior. Having overheard that only one son was his, <b>when</b> that man <b>was dying he said to</b> his family: <b>All of my property</b> is left <b>to one son.</b>
<b>They did not know</b> to <b>which of them</b> he intended to leave his property. <b>They came before Rabbi Bena’a</b> for guidance, and <b>he said to</b> the sons: <b>Go strike your father’s grave, until he rises and reveals to you to which of you he left</b> his property. <b>They all went,</b> but <b>that</b> one <b>who was his son did not go.</b> Rabbi Bena’a <b>said to them: All of</b> the <b>property belongs to this</b> son who did not go. The other brothers were angry. <b>They went and slandered [<i>akhlu kuretza</i>]</b> Rabbi Bena’a in <b>the king’s house. They said: There is one man among the Jews who removes money from people without witnesses and without any</b> evidence. The king’s guards <b>brought</b> Rabbi Bena’a <b>and imprisoned him.</b>
<b>The wife of</b> Rabbi Bena’a <b>went</b> and <b>said to</b> the guards: <b>I had one servant. They cut off his head, and skinned him and ate his flesh, and they fill him with water and</b> give their <b>friends to drink from him, and they have not paid me</b> his <b>value nor have they rented him.</b>
<b>They did not know what she was saying to them. They said: Let us bring the wise</b> man <b>of the Jews, and let him say</b> what she meant. <b>They called Rabbi Bena’a,</b> and <b>he said to them: She spoke to you of a water skin [<i>zarnuka</i>].</b> In other words, she was referring to a goat she owned that was slaughtered, its meat eaten, and its skin made into a water skin that could be filled with drinking water. <b>They said: Since</b> he is <b>so wise, let</b> him <b>sit at the gate</b> where the judges congregate <b>and render judgment.</b>
Rabbi Bena’a <b>saw that it was written upon the gate [<i>be’abbula</i>]: Any judge who is summoned to judgment is not considered a judge,</b> as judges must be above reproach. <b>He said to them: If that is so,</b> then if <b>a person comes from elsewhere</b>

Daf 58b

<b>and summons</b> a judge <b>to judgment,</b> has he <b>disqualified</b> the judge even if he were later to be exonerated? <b>Rather,</b> it should say: <b>Any judge who is summoned to judgment and money is lawfully taken from him,</b> i.e., he was ordered to return someone’s property, <b>is not considered a judge.</b> When they heard this, <b>they wrote this</b> addendum to the original inscription: <b>But the elders of the Jews say</b> that <b>any judge who is summoned to judgment and money is lawfully taken from him is not considered a judge.</b>
Rabbi Bena’a also <b>saw that it was written</b> there: <b>At the head</b> of <b>all death am I, blood,</b> i.e., people die from an excess of blood; <b>at the head</b> of <b>all life am I, wine,</b> i.e., wine is what gives life. He said to them: <b>If that is so,</b> in the case of someone <b>who falls from a roof and dies, or</b> someone <b>who falls from a palm tree and dies,</b> was it <b>blood</b> that <b>killed him? And furthermore,</b> concerning someone <b>who is on the way to death, can they give him a drink of wine and</b> he will <b>live? Rather, this</b> is what <b>should be written: At the head of all illness am I, blood; at the head of all healing am I, wine.</b> When they heard this, <b>they wrote this</b> addendum to the original inscription: <b>But the elders of the Jews say: At the head of all illness am I, blood; at the head of all healing am I, wine. In a place where there is no wine, herbs are required there</b> as medicines.
Having related that incident, the Gemara notes that <b>at the entrance of Kapotekiyya</b> it was <b>written: <i>Anpak</i>, <i>anbag</i>, <i>antal</i>,</b> which are all names for the same measurement. <b>And what is <i>antal</i>? It is</b> the <b>quarter</b>-<i>log</i> <b>of</b> the <b>Torah.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a spout</b> protruding from one’s roof gutter draining water into another’s property, its owner <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use, <b>but</b> he does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege with regard to its place,</b> as the Gemara will explain. With regard to <b>a gutter pipe</b> that traverses the length of the roof, one does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use.
With regard to <b>an Egyptian ladder,</b> which is small and portable, one <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use. <b>But with regard to a Tyrian</b> ladder, which is large and fixed in place, one does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use.
With regard to <b>an Egyptian window,</b> one <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use; <b>but with regard to a Tyrian</b> window, one does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use. <b>What is</b> the defining feature of <b>an Egyptian window?</b> It is <b>any</b> window that is so small <b>that a person’s head is not able to fit inside it. Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> a window <b>has a frame, even though a person’s head is not able to fit inside it,</b> one does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the mishna’s statement: With regard to <b>a spout,</b> its owner <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use, <b>but</b> he does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege with regard to its place? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said: This</b> is what it <b>is saying:</b> Concerning <b>a spout,</b> its owner <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use <b>with regard to one side,</b> i.e., the owner of the field below has the right to move the spout from one place to another on one side of the roof, <b>but</b> he does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege concerning its place with regard to two sides,</b> i.e., the owner of the field below does not have the right to move it to another side of the roof.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina said</b> there is a different explanation: With regard to <b>a spout,</b> its owner <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> size, <b>as if it was long,</b> the owner of the field below may <b>shorten it, but</b> one does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege with regard to its place, as if</b> the owner of the field below <b>comes to remove it</b> entirely, <b>he may not remove it.</b>
<b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said</b> there is a different explanation: With regard to <b>a spout,</b> its owner <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use, <b>as if</b> the owner of the field below <b>wishes to build beneath it,</b> he may <b>build,</b> and the owner of the spout may not prevent him from doing so; <b>but</b> one does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege with regard to its place, as if</b> the owner of the field below <b>comes to remove it</b> entirely, <b>he may not remove it.</b>

Daf 59a

<b>We learned</b> in the mishna: With regard to <b>a gutter pipe,</b> one does <b>have</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use. <b>Granted, according to the one who says those</b> first <b>two</b> explanations, i.e., Shmuel and Rabbi Ḥanina, it is <b>well.</b> The distinction between the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a spout and that of a gutter pipe is clear: Since the gutter pipe is fixed in place, there is an acquired privilege, and it may not be moved or shortened.
<b>But according to</b> Rav Yirmeya bar Abba, <b>the one who says</b> that the mishna means: <b>If</b> the owner of the field <b>wishes to build beneath it</b> he may <b>build, what difference does it make to</b> the owner of the gutter pipe if the owner of the field builds beneath it? Why would he have the right to prevent it?
The Gemara answers: <b>Here we are dealing with a gutter pipe</b> that is made of stone and is built into the walls <b>of</b> the <b>building,</b> in a case <b>where</b> the owner of the gutter pipe <b>said to</b> the owner of the field: <b>It is not amenable to me</b> that you build beneath my gutter pipe, <b>as my walls will weaken</b> as a result.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a pipe</b> from <b>which water is draining into another’s courtyard and the owner of the roof comes to seal</b> his drainage pipe, <b>the owner of the courtyard can prevent him</b> from doing so. <b>As</b> the owner of the field can <b>say to him: Just as you have acquired my courtyard for</b> the purpose of <b>throwing your water into it, I have also acquired the water of your roof,</b> and since I wish to use it, you may not seal the pipe.
It <b>was stated</b> that there is a dispute with regard to this issue, as <b>Rabbi Oshaya says:</b> The owner of the courtyard <b>can prevent</b> the owner of the roof from sealing the pipe, while <b>Rabbi Ḥama,</b> Rabbi Oshaya’s father, <b>says: He cannot prevent</b> it. Rabbi Oshaya <b>went</b> and <b>asked</b> Rabbi Ḥama’s father, <b>Rabbi Bisa.</b> Rabbi Bisa <b>said to them:</b> He <b>can prevent</b> it. <b>Rami bar Ḥama read</b> the verse <b>about</b> him: “And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; <b>and a threefold cord is not quickly broken”</b> (Ecclesiastes 4:12), saying that <b>this</b> applies to <b>Rabbi Oshaya, son of Rabbi Ḥama, son of Rabbi Bisa,</b> three generations of Torah scholars in one family who knew one another and conversed with each other with regard to matters of <i>halakha</i>.
§ The mishna teaches that with regard to <b>an Egyptian ladder,</b> which is small and portable, one <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use. The Gemara asks: <b>What is an Egyptian ladder like?</b> The members <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai say: It</b> is <b>any</b> ladder that <b>does not have four rungs.</b>
The mishna teaches that with regard to <b>an Egyptian window,</b> one <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different with regard to</b> an Egyptian <b>ladder, that</b> the mishna <b>does not explain</b> what it is, <b>and what is different with regard to</b> an Egyptian <b>window, that</b> the mishna <b>does explain</b> what it is? The Gemara answers: It was necessary for the mishna to state the definition of an Egyptian window according to the unattributed opinion of the mishna <b>because</b> it <b>wants to</b> cite the <b>dissenting</b> opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda in the latter clause.</b>
With regard to windows, <b>Rabbi Zeira says:</b> If one built a large window at a height that is <b>lower than four cubits</b> from the ground, he <b>has</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use, <b>and</b> therefore, his neighbor <b>can protest</b> the initial construction of the window. If one built a large window at a height that is <b>above four cubits</b> from the ground, he <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use, <b>and</b> therefore his neighbor <b>cannot protest</b> its construction. <b>And Rabbi Ile’a says: Even</b> if it is built at a height that is <b>above four cubits</b> from the ground, he <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use, <b>but</b> nevertheless, his neighbor <b>can protest</b> its construction.
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>they disagree with regard to</b> whether there is <b>coercion concerning conduct</b> characteristic <b>of Sodom?</b> Perhaps their dispute is with regard to a circumstance where one will not suffer any loss while another gains some benefit, and the former desires to prevent the latter from gaining the benefit, if the former is coerced into not being evil without reason and consequently allows the latter to derive the benefit, counter to the behavior of the residents of Sodom. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Zeira, <b>holds</b> that there is <b>coercion,</b> and therefore the neighbor who does not suffer any damage from a high window cannot protest, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Ile’a, <b>holds</b> that there is <b>no coercion.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, everyone</b> agrees that there is <b>coercion</b> concerning conduct characteristic of Sodom, <b>and</b> it <b>is different here,</b> as according to the opinion of Rabbi Ile’a this is not conduct characteristic of Sodom, <b>as</b> the neighbor can <b>say to</b> the one who constructed the window: There are <b>times when you place a bench beneath yourself, and</b> you <b>stand and see</b> into my home. Therefore, I can protest. The Gemara relates that there was <b>a certain</b> individual <b>who came before Rabbi Ami</b> and presented this precise scenario. Rabbi Ami <b>sent him before Rabbi Abba bar Memel</b> to ask for a ruling. Rabbi Abba bar Memel <b>said to him: Act in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ile’a.</b>
Since the mishna cited a dispute with regard to the conditions under which an owner has acquired the privilege to use a window, the Gemara teaches that <b>Shmuel says: And</b> if a window was built <b>for</b> the purpose of enabling <b>light</b> to enter a dark room, then the owner of the window <b>has</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use, <b>whatever</b> size <b>it is,</b> not only if it is a large window. And if the neighbor did not protest its construction, he cannot subsequently force the owner of the window to seal it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a projection</b> emerging from the wall of one’s house, overhanging a courtyard, one <b>has</b> the means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use if it protrudes at least <b>as far as a handbreadth,</b>

Daf 59b

<b>and</b> the owner of the courtyard <b>can protest</b> its construction. If it protrudes <b>less than a handbreadth,</b> the owner of the house <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use, <b>and</b> the owner of the courtyard <b>cannot protest</b> its construction.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Mani says, and some say</b> that <b>Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that <b>Rabbi Mani says:</b> If one <b>established an acquired privilege with regard to</b> a projection of <b>a handbreadth,</b> he has <b>established an acquired privilege with regard to four</b> handbreadths. The Gemara asks: <b>What is he saying? Abaye said</b> that <b>this</b> is what he <b>is saying:</b> If one <b>established an acquired privilege</b> with regard to a projection that measures <b>one handbreadth wide by four</b> handbreadths <b>long,</b> he has <b>established an acquired privilege with regard to</b> extending the projection to <b>a width</b> of <b>four</b> handbreadths.
The mishna teaches that if the projection protrudes <b>less than a handbreadth</b> the owner of the house <b>has no</b> means to establish <b>an acquired privilege for its</b> use, <b>and</b> the owner of the courtyard <b>cannot protest. Rav Huna says: They taught only</b> that the <b>owner of the roof</b> cannot protest the actions <b>of</b> the <b>owner of the courtyard,</b> i.e., he may not demand that the owner of the courtyard refrain from construction that interferes with the former’s use of the projection. <b>But</b> the <b>owner of the courtyard can protest</b> the actions <b>of</b> the <b>owner of the roof,</b> and demand that the latter not build a projection of any size, even less than a handbreadth. He can also demand that the owner of the roof not use an existing projection, since it leads to damage caused by sight. <b>And Rav Yehuda says: Even</b> the <b>owner of the courtyard cannot protest</b> the actions <b>of</b> the <b>owner of the roof.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say that</b> they <b>disagree with regard to damage</b> caused by <b>sight? As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Huna, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is considered</b> to be <b>damage,</b> and therefore the owner of the courtyard can protest, since the owner of the roof has the means to see into the other’s courtyard when using this projection, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>it is not considered</b> to be <b>damage.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>No, everyone</b> agrees that damage caused by sight <b>is considered</b> to be <b>damage. And</b> Rav Yehuda holds it <b>is different here, as</b> the owner of the roof can <b>say to</b> the owner of the courtyard: The projection <b>is not suitable for use,</b> since it is too small for me to stand upon and look into the courtyard. <b>For what</b> purpose <b>is it suitable? To hang items on it,</b> and nothing more. <b>I will turn my face</b> away <b>and hang</b> items <b>on it</b> without looking into your courtyard.
<b>And the other</b> <i>amora</i>, Rav Huna, holds that the owner of the courtyard can <b>say to</b> the owner of the roof: There may be <b>times when you are frightened</b> due to the height of the projection, and you will look into my courtyard while using it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person may not open his windows,</b> i.e., build an opening in a wall to use as a window, <b>into a courtyard belonging to partners,</b> i.e., a courtyard in which he is a partner. If he <b>purchased a house in another,</b> adjacent <b>courtyard,</b> he <b>may not open</b> the house <b>into a courtyard belonging to partners.</b> If he <b>built a loft on top of his house, he may not open it into a courtyard belonging to partners. Rather, if he desired</b> to build a loft, he may <b>build a room within his house, or</b> he may <b>build a loft on top of his house, and open it into his house,</b> not directly into the courtyard.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> With regard to the mishna’s ruling that one may not open a window into a courtyard that he co-owns, the Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> did the mishna <b>specifically</b> render it prohibited for one to open a window <b>into a courtyard belonging to partners?</b> One may <b>not</b> open a window <b>into another’s courtyard either,</b> as it will lead to damage caused by sight.
The Gemara replies that the mishna <b>is speaking</b> utilizing the style of: <b>It is not necessary,</b> as follows: <b>It is not necessary</b> to say <b>that</b> it is <b>not</b> permitted for one to open a window <b>into another’s courtyard,</b> where he is certainly not allowed to look; <b>but</b> where one wants to open a window <b>into a courtyard belonging to partners, where</b> the owner of the window can <b>say to</b> the other partner: <b>Ultimately,</b> since <b>you need to conceal</b> yourself <b>from me</b> and conduct yourself modestly <b>in the courtyard</b> where I too am a partner and have the right to be present, why does it bother you if I open a window into there? Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> the partner may <b>say to him: Until now I needed to conceal</b> myself <b>from you</b> only when we were both <b>in the courtyard. Now I will need to conceal</b> myself <b>from you even in the house,</b> as you can see into my house from your window.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident involving a person who opened his windows into a courtyard belonging to partners and came before Rabbi Yishmael bar Rabbi Yosei,</b> who <b>said to him: You have established an acquired privilege, my son; you have established an acquired privilege,</b> and you may not be prevented from using the windows. <b>And he came before Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> who <b>said</b> to him: <b>You toiled and opened</b> the windows; you must <b>toil and seal</b> them, as the partners have the right to prevent you from using these windows.
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b>

Daf 60a

<b>And to seal,</b> i.e., if one sealed another’s window in his presence, <b>there is an acquired privilege</b> established <b>immediately</b> to keep the window sealed, <b>as it is not common</b> behavior for <b>a person to have his</b> source of <b>light sealed in his presence and</b> remain <b>silent.</b> The fact that he did not immediately protest indicates that the one who sealed the window had the legal right to do so unilaterally, or that the owner of the window agreed.
§ The mishna teaches that if one <b>purchased a house in another,</b> adjacent <b>courtyard,</b> he <b>may not open</b> the house <b>into a courtyard belonging to partners.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Because</b> by adding residents to the courtyard <b>it increases their traffic,</b> and the residents of the courtyard do not wish to be disturbed by additional people passing through.
The Gemara questions this. But <b>say the last clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rather, if he desired</b> to build a loft, he may <b>build a room within his house, or</b> he may <b>build a loft above his house,</b> and have it open into his house, not directly into the courtyard. <b>But</b> if he does so, <b>isn’t</b> there still a concern that <b>it increases the traffic? Rav Huna said</b> as an explanation: <b>What</b> does the mishna mean when it says that he may build <b>a room?</b> It means <b>that</b> he may <b>divide</b> an existing room <b>in two. And what is</b> the <b>loft</b> to which the mishna is referring? It is <b>an internal story</b> created by dividing an existing space into two stories.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A person may not open an entrance opposite</b> another <b>entrance or a window opposite</b> another <b>window toward a courtyard belonging to partners,</b> so as to ensure that the residents will enjoy a measure of privacy. If there <b>was a small</b> entrance <b>he may not enlarge it.</b> If there was <b>one</b> entrance <b>he may not fashion it</b> into <b>two. But</b> one <b>may open an entrance opposite</b> another <b>entrance or a window opposite</b> another <b>window toward the public domain.</b> Similarly, if there <b>was a small</b> entrance <b>he may enlarge it,</b> and if there was <b>one</b> entrance <b>he may fashion it</b> into <b>two.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> i.e., that one may not open an en-trance opposite another entrance, or a window opposite another window, derived? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says that</b> the <b>verse states: “And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling tribe by tribe;</b> and the spirit of God came upon him” (Numbers 24:2). The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> was it that Balaam <b>saw</b> that so inspired him? He <b>saw that the entrances of their tents were not aligned with each other,</b> ensuring that each family enjoyed a measure of privacy. And he <b>said:</b> If this is the case, <b>these</b> people <b>are worthy of having the Divine Presence rest on them.</b>
The mishna teaches that if there <b>was a small</b> entrance <b>he may not enlarge it. Rami bar Ḥama thought to say</b> this means that if the entrance was the width <b>of four</b> cubits, one <b>may not fashion it</b> to the width <b>of eight</b> cubits, <b>as</b> he would then be allowed to <b>take eight</b> corresponding cubits <b>in</b> the <b>courtyard.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that one is entitled to utilize the area of the courtyard up to a depth of four cubits along the width of the opening. <b>But</b> if the entrance was the width <b>of two</b> cubits and one wishes <b>to fashion it</b> to the width <b>of four</b> cubits, one may <b>well</b> do so, as in any event he already had the right to use an area of four cubits by four cubits in front of the entrance. <b>Rava said to him:</b> This is not so, as his neighbor <b>can say to him: I can conceal</b> myself <b>from you with</b> there being <b>a small entrance,</b> but <b>I cannot conceal</b> myself <b>from you with</b> there being <b>a large entrance.</b>
The mishna teaches that if there <b>was one</b> entrance <b>he may not fashion it into two.</b> In this case as well, <b>Rami bar Ḥama thought to say</b> that this means if the entrance was the width <b>of four</b> cubits he <b>may not make it into two</b> openings, <b>each</b> the width <b>of two</b> cubits, <b>as</b> he would then be allowed to <b>take eight</b> corresponding cubits <b>in</b> the <b>courtyard,</b> four for each entrance. <b>But</b> if it was the width <b>of eight</b> cubits and he wishes <b>to make it into</b> two openings, <b>each</b> the width <b>of four</b> cubits, he may <b>well</b> do so, as in any event he already had the right to use an area of eight cubits by four cubits in front of his entrance. <b>Rava said to him:</b> This is not so, as his neighbor <b>can say to him: I can conceal</b> myself <b>from you with</b> there being <b>one entrance,</b> but <b>I cannot conceal</b> myself <b>from you with</b> there being <b>two entrances.</b>
The mishna teaches: <b>But</b> one <b>may open an entrance opposite</b> another <b>entrance</b> or a window opposite another window <b>toward the public domain.</b> Why is this so? <b>Because</b> he can <b>say to</b> the one who wishes to protest: <b>Ultimately, you must conceal yourself from</b> the <b>people of the public domain.</b> Since you cannot stop them from passing by and therefore cannot engage in behavior that requires privacy with your entrance open, it is of no consequence to you if I open an entrance as well.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <b>may not form an</b> empty <b>space be-neath the public domain</b> by digging <b>pits, ditches, or caves. Rabbi Eliezer deems</b> it <b>permitted</b> for one to do so, provided that he places a covering strong enough that <b>a wagon laden with stones would</b> be able to <b>tread</b> on it without breaking it, therefore ensuring that the empty space will not cause any damage to those in the public domain. One <b>may not extend projections or balconies [<i>ugzuztraot</i>] into the public domain. Rather, if he desired</b> to build one he may <b>draw back into his</b> property by moving his wall, <b>and extend</b> the projection to the end of his property line. If one <b>purchased a courtyard in which there are projections and balconies</b> extending into the public domain, this courtyard <b>retains its presumptive status,</b> i.e., the owner has the acquired privilege of their use, and the court does not demand their removal.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion that if the covering of the space is strong enough to support a wagon laden with stones then it is permitted to dig out the empty space, is eminently reasonable; <b>but</b> what do <b>the Rabbis</b> hold? The Gemara answers: There are <b>times when</b> the cover <b>erodes</b> over time, <b>and he is not aware,</b> thereby potentially causing damage to those in the public domain.
The mishna teaches that <b>one may not extend projections or balconies</b> into the public domain. The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Ami had a projection that protruded into an alleyway, and a certain man also had a projection that protruded into the public domain,</b> and the <b>general public was preventing</b> the man from leaving it there, as it interfered with traffic. He <b>came before Rabbi Ami,</b> who <b>said to him: Go sever</b> your projection.
The man <b>said to him: But</b> the <b>Master also has</b> a similar projection. Rabbi Ami said to him: It is different, as <b>mine protrudes into an alleyway,</b> where a limited number of people live, and the <b>residents of the alleyway waive</b> their right to protest <b>to me. Yours protrudes into the public domain,</b> which does not belong to any specific individuals. <b>Who</b> can <b>waive</b> their right to protest <b>to you?</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yannai had a tree that was leaning into the public domain.</b> There <b>was a certain man who also had a tree that was leaning into the public domain,</b> and the <b>general public was preventing him</b> from leaving it there, insisting he cut it down, as required by the mishna (27b). He <b>came before Rabbi Yannai,</b> who <b>said to him:</b>

Daf 60b

<b>Go now, and come tomorrow. At night,</b> Rabbi Yannai <b>sent</b> and had someone <b>cut</b> down <b>that</b> tree that belonged <b>to him.</b>
<b>The next day,</b> that man <b>came before</b> Rabbi Yannai, who <b>said to him: Go, cut</b> down your tree. The man <b>said to him: But</b> the <b>Master also has</b> a tree that leans into the public domain. Rabbi Yannai <b>said to him: Go</b> and <b>see: If mine is cut</b> down, then <b>cut yours</b> down. <b>If mine is not cut</b> down, <b>you do not</b> have to <b>cut</b> yours down, either.
The Gemara asks: <b>At the outset what did</b> Rabbi Yannai <b>hold, and ultimately, what did he hold?</b> The Gemara replies: <b>At the outset, he held</b> that <b>the general public is amenable</b> to having the tree there, <b>as they sit in its shade. Once he saw that</b> they were <b>preventing</b> someone else who owned a tree from keeping his, he understood that it was only out of respect that they did not object to his tree being there. He therefore <b>sent</b> someone to <b>cut it</b> down. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why did he tell the man to return the next day? <b>Let</b> him <b>say to him: Go cut</b> down <b>your</b> tree, <b>and then I will cut mine</b> down. The Gemara answers: <b>Because of</b> the statement of <b>Reish Lakish, who said:</b> The verse states: <b>“Gather yourselves together and gather [<i>hitkosheshu vakoshu</i>]”</b> (Zephaniah 2:1), and this can be explained homiletically to mean: <b>Adorn [<i>keshot</i>] yourself and afterward adorn others,</b> i.e., act properly before requiring others to do so.
§ The mishna teaches that one may not extend projections or balconies into the public domain. <b>Rather, if he desired</b> to build one he may <b>draw back into his</b> property by moving his wall, <b>and extend</b> the projection to the end of his property line. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one <b>drew back</b> into his property <b>but did not extend</b> the projection at that time, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>whether</b> he may <b>return and extend</b> it at a later date? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>drew back</b> into his property, he <b>may extend</b> it even later, <b>and Reish Lakish says:</b> If one <b>drew back</b> into his property but did not build the projection at that time, he <b>may not extend</b> it later.
The Gemara presents an alternative version of the dispute: <b>Rabbi Ya’akov said to Rabbi Yirmeya bar Taḥlifa: I will explain</b> the matter <b>to you. To</b> later <b>extend</b> a projection, <b>everyone agrees that</b> he <b>may extend</b> it, since he is adding within his own property. <b>Where they disagree</b> is <b>with regard to</b> whether he may <b>return</b> the <b>walls to their</b> prior <b>place. And</b> with regard to this disagreement <b>the opposite was stated: Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> he <b>may not return</b> the walls to their prior place, <b>and Reish Lakish says</b> he <b>may return</b> them.
Rabbi Ya’akov explains their reasoning: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that he <b>may not return</b> the walls to their prior place <b>because</b> of the statement <b>of Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to <b>a path that</b> the <b>public has established</b> as a public thoroughfare, <b>it is prohibited to ruin it,</b> i.e., to prevent people from using it. Once the public has become accustomed to using the place where his wall had stood, he may not repossess that space. <b>And Reish Lakish says</b> that he <b>may return</b> the walls to their prior place, because <b>that matter</b> applies in a case <b>where there is no space,</b> i.e., if he were to move back the wall there would be no space for the public to walk, but <b>here there is space,</b> since they can still walk through the public domain.
The mishna teaches that if one <b>purchased a courtyard in which there are projections and balconies</b> extending into the public domain, this courtyard <b>retains its presumptive status,</b> allowing the owner to use the projections. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> If the wall of the courtyard <b>fell, he may return and build it</b> as it was, including the projections or balconies.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> based on that which is taught in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:17): <b>One may not plaster, and one may not tile, and one may not paint [<i>mefayyeḥin</i>]</b> images <b>in the present,</b> as a sign of mourning for the destruction of the Temple. But if one <b>purchased a courtyard</b> that was <b>plastered, tiled,</b> or <b>painted</b> with images, <b>this</b> courtyard <b>retains its presumptive status,</b> and it is assumed that it was done in a permitted manner. If <b>it</b> then <b>fell, he may not return and build it</b> in its previous form. This indicates that one may not rebuild a building in a manner that is prohibited, even if there was an acquired privilege to maintain it in that manner.
The Gemara answers: A case of <b>forbidden</b> matters <b>is different,</b> i.e., in the case of the <i>baraita</i>, he may not rebuild it because it is prohibited for him to do so. In this mishna, the issue is encroachment upon the rights of others, and once he had an acquired privilege to use the projections or balconies, he maintains that right.
§ With regard to the ruling of the above-quoted <i>baraita</i>, <b>the Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sota</i> 15:9): <b>A person may not plaster his house with plaster, but if</b> he <b>mixed sand or straw into</b> the plaster, which dulls its luster, it is <b>permitted. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If he <b>mixed sand into it, it is</b> white <b>cement [<i>terakesid</i>],</b> which is of a higher quality than standard plaster, <b>and</b> it is <b>prohibited,</b> but if he mixed in <b>straw,</b> it is <b>permitted.</b>
§ Having mentioned the prohibition against plastering, which is a sign of mourning over the destruction of the Temple, the Gemara discusses related matters. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sota</i> 15:11): <b>When the Temple was destroyed a second</b> time, there was <b>an increase</b> in the number of <b>ascetics among</b> the <b>Jews,</b> whose practice was <b>to not eat meat and to not drink wine. Rabbi Yehoshua joined them</b> to discuss their practice. <b>He said to them: My children, for what</b> reason do <b>you not eat meat and</b> do <b>you not drink wine? They said to him: Shall we eat meat, from which</b> offerings <b>are sacrificed upon</b> the <b>altar, and now</b> the altar <b>has ceased</b> to exist? <b>Shall we drink wine, which is poured</b> as a libation <b>upon the altar, and now</b> the altar <b>has ceased</b> to exist?
Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: If so, we will not eat bread</b> either, <b>since</b> the <b>meal-offerings</b> that were offered upon the altar <b>have ceased.</b> They replied: You are correct. It is <b>possible</b> to subsist <b>with produce.</b> He said to them: <b>We will not eat produce</b> either, <b>since</b> the bringing of <b>the first fruits have ceased.</b> They replied: You are correct. We will no longer eat the produce of the seven species from which the first fruits were brought, as it is <b>possible</b> to subsist <b>with other produce.</b> He said to them: If so, <b>we will not drink water, since the water libation has ceased. They were silent,</b> as they realized that they could not survive without water.
Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to them: My children, come, and I will tell you</b> how we should act. <b>To not mourn at all</b> is <b>impossible, as</b> the <b>decree was already issued</b> and the Temple has been destroyed. <b>But to mourn excessively</b> as you are doing is also <b>impossible, as</b> the Sages <b>do not issue a decree upon the public unless a majority of the public is able to abide by it, as it is written: “You are cursed with the curse, yet you rob Me, even this whole nation”</b> (Malachi 3:9), indicating that the prophet rebukes the people for neglecting observances only if they were accepted by the whole nation.
Rabbi Yehoshua continues: <b>Rather, this</b> is what <b>the Sages said: A person</b> may <b>plaster his house with plaster, but</b> he must <b>leave</b> over <b>a small amount in it</b> without plaster to remember the destruction of the Temple. The Gemara interjects: <b>And how much</b> is a small amount? <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> One <b>cubit by</b> one <b>cubit. Rav Ḥisda said:</b> This should be <b>opposite the entrance,</b> so that it is visible to all.
Rabbi Yehoshua continues: The Sages said that <b>a person</b> may <b>prepare all</b> that he <b>needs for a meal, but</b> he must <b>leave</b> out <b>a small item</b> to remember the destruction of the Temple. The Gemara interjects: <b>What</b> is <b>this</b> small item? <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Something akin to <b>small, fried fish.</b>
Rabbi Yehoshua continues: The Sages said that <b>a woman</b> may <b>engage</b> in <b>all</b> of <b>her cosmetic treatments, but</b> she must <b>leave</b> out <b>a small matter</b> to remember the destruction of the Temple. The Gemara interjects: <b>What</b> is <b>this</b> small matter? <b>Rav said:</b> She does not remove hair from the place on the <b>temple</b> from which women would remove hair. The source for these practices is a verse, <b>as it is stated: “If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its cunning. Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth,</b> if I remember you not; if I set not Jerusalem above my highest joy” (Psalms 137:5–6).
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Above my highest [<i>rosh</i>] joy? Rav Yitzḥak says: This</b> is referring to the <b>burnt ashes</b> that are customarily placed <b>on the head [<i>rosh</i>] of bridegrooms</b> at the time of their wedding celebrations, to remember the destruction of the Temple. <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Where are they placed?</b> Abaye replied: <b>On</b> the <b>place</b> where <b>phylacteries</b> are placed, <b>as it is stated: “To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them a garland in place of ashes”</b> (Isaiah 61:3). Since phylacteries are referred to as a garland (see Ezekiel 24:17), it may be inferred from this verse that the ashes were placed in the same place as the phylacteries.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And anyone who mourns for</b> the destruction of <b>Jerusalem</b> will <b>merit and see its joy, as it is stated: “Rejoice with Jerusalem,</b> and be glad with her, all that love her; rejoice for joy with her, all that mourn for her” (Isaiah 66:10).
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sota</i> 15:10) that <b>Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha said: From the day that the Temple was destroyed, by right, we should decree upon ourselves not to eat meat and not to drink wine, but</b> the Sages <b>do not issue a decree upon the public unless a majority of the public is able to abide by it.</b>
<b>And from the day that the wicked kingdom,</b> i.e., Rome, <b>spread, who decree evil and harsh decrees upon us, and nullify Torah</b> study <b>and</b> the performance of <b>mitzvot for us, and do not allow us to enter</b> the celebration of the first <b>week of a son,</b> i.e., circumcision, <b>and some say: To</b> enter the celebration of the <b>salvation of</b> a firstborn <b>son; by right we should</b> each <b>decree upon ourselves not to marry a woman and</b> not <b>to produce offspring, and it will turn out</b> that the <b>descendants of Abraham our forefather will cease</b> to exist <b>on their own,</b> rather than being forced into a situation where there are sons who are not circumcised.
<b>But</b> concerning a situation such as this, the following principle is applied: <b>Leave the Jews alone</b> and do not impose decrees by which they cannot abide. <b>It is better that they be unwitting</b> sinners, who do not know that what they are doing is improper considering the circumstances, <b>and not be intentional</b> wrongdoers, who marry and procreate despite knowing that they should not.

Daf 61a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <b>who sells a house</b> without specifying what is included in the sale <b>has not sold the gallery,</b> an extension built above or alongside the main building, <b>and</b> this is so <b>even if</b> the gallery is attached to the house and <b>opens into it. Nor</b> has he sold <b>the room behind</b> the house, even if it is accessible only from inside the house. He has <b>also not</b> sold <b>the roof when it has a parapet ten handbreadths high,</b> as such a roof is considered a separate entity and is therefore not included in the sale of the house. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: If</b> the parapet <b>has the form of a doorway,</b> that is, if it consists of two upright posts with a beam crossing over them, then <b>even if</b> the parapet <b>is not ten handbreadths high,</b> the roof <b>is not sold</b> together with the house, unless it is specifically included in the sale.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What is a gallery? Here</b> in Babylonia <b>they interpreted</b> this as referring to <b>an attic [<i>apta</i>]. Rav Yosef said:</b> It means <b>a windowed structure [<i>bidka ḥalila</i>]</b> attached to the main building. The Gemara notes that <b>according to the one who says</b> that <b>an attic is not sold</b> together with a house, <b>all the more so is a windowed structure</b> attached to the house <b>not sold</b> together with a house, as it is certainly considered a separate entity and not part of the main building. But <b>according to the one who says</b> that a gallery is <b>a windowed structure</b> attached to the house, it is only such a structure that is not included in the sale of the house, <b>but an attic is sold</b> together with a house.
<b>Rav Yosef taught:</b> A small structure attached to a building <b>has three names</b> in the Bible: <b>Gallery [<i>yatzia</i>], side chamber [<i>tzela</i>],</b> and <b>cell [<i>ta</i>].</b> Such a structure is called <b>a gallery, as it is written: “The bottommost gallery [<i>hayyatzia</i>] was five cubits wide”</b> (I Kings 6:6). It is also called <b>a side chamber, as it is written: “And the side chambers [<i>vehatzelaot</i>] were one over another, thirty-three times”</b> (Ezekiel 41:6). Additionally, it is called <b>a cell, as it is written: “And the cell [<i>vehata</i>] was one reed long, and one reed wide; and the space between the cells was five cubits”</b> (Ezekiel 40:7). <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it can be seen that a small structure attached to a building is called a cell <b>from here,</b> as was taught in the mishna (<i>Middot</i> 4:7): <b>The wall of the Sanctuary</b> was <b>six</b> cubits wide, <b>and the cell [<i>vehata</i>]</b> in back of it was <b>six</b> cubits wide, and <b>the wall of the cell</b> was <b>five</b> cubits wide.
§ Relating to the mishna’s statement that a gallery is not included in the sale of a house, <b>Mar Zutra said: And that</b> is the <i>halakha</i> only <b>when</b> the gallery <b>has</b> an area of at least <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits.</b>
<b>Ravina said to Mar Zutra: According to your</b> opinion, <b>that you say</b> a gallery is not excluded from the sale of a house <b>unless it is</b> at least <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits</b> in size, there is a difficulty. As <b>if that is so,</b> then <b>with regard to</b> the exclusion of <b>a pit</b> or a cistern from the sale of a house, <b>about which we learned</b> in a mishna (64a): One who sells a house has sold <b>neither the pit nor the cistern, even if he writes for</b> the buyer in the bill of sale that he is selling <b>him the depth and the height</b> of the house; <b>so too,</b> should we say that only <b>if they have</b> an area of at least <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits, yes,</b> they are excluded from the sale of the house, but <b>if not, no,</b> they are not excluded? This is difficult, as a pit is not four cubits wide, and consequently, it would never be excluded.
Mar Zutra responded: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in that mishna, <b>this,</b> the excavations, have <b>a discrete use,</b> to store water, and they cannot possibly be used as living quarters, <b>and that,</b> the house, has <b>a discrete use,</b> to serve as living quarters, and so they are considered separate entities even if the excavation is not four cubits wide. But <b>here,</b> in the case of a gallery, both <b>this,</b> the gallery, <b>and that,</b> the house, <b>have the same use,</b> and so <b>if</b> the gallery <b>is</b> at least <b>four</b> by four <b>cubits</b> it is deemed <b>significant</b> and considered a separate entity, <b>but if</b> it is <b>not</b> four by four cubits, it is <b>not</b> deemed <b>significant</b> in its own right, but simply another part of the house.
The mishna teaches that one who sells a house without specifying what is included in the sale has not sold the gallery, <b>nor</b> has he sold <b>the room behind</b> the house, even if it is accessible only <b>from it.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that the mishna taught that <b>a gallery is not sold</b> along with the house, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that <b>a room</b> behind the house is not included in such a sale?

Daf 61b

<b>No,</b> this ruling is <b>necessary</b> to teach that the room behind the house is excluded from the sale of the house <b>even if</b> the seller <b>delineated the boundaries</b> of the house <b>for</b> the buyer in the bill of sale by listing places <b>outside</b> the room, e.g., noting the houses that border the property being sold. Even though this might suggest that the room is included in the sale, the mishna teaches that it is not.
This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> With regard to one <b>who sells a residence to another in a large building [<i>bira</i>]</b> containing several residences, <b>even if he delineates for him the external boundaries</b> of the large building, he did not sell him the entire building, but rather <b>he enlarged</b> upon <b>the boundaries for him.</b> That is, the seller did not mean to delineate the precise borders of what he was selling; rather, he delineated the boundaries in a broad manner, giving the general location of the specific residence subject to the transaction.
With regard to Rav Naḥman’s statement, the Gemara inquires: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case? <b>If we say</b> that this is referring to a place <b>where they call a residence a residence, and a building a building,</b> and they always differentiate between the two terms, it is <b>obvious</b> that he did not intend to sell him the entire building but merely enlarged upon the boundaries for him, as <b>he sold him a residence</b> and <b>did not sell him a large building. Rather,</b> explain that this is referring to a place <b>where they also call a building a residence.</b> But in that case, why not say that the seller <b>sold him the entire</b> building, since he delineated the external boundaries of the large building?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> Rav Naḥman’s ruling is <b>necessary</b> in a place <b>where most</b> of the people <b>call a residence a residence,</b> and <b>a building</b> they call <b>a building, but there are also</b> some people <b>who call a building a residence. Lest you say</b> that since the seller delineated the building’s external boundaries, this indicates that he meant to <b>sell him the entire</b> building, Rav Naḥman <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so. <b>As,</b> if the seller intended to sell him the entire building, <b>he would have written</b> in the bill of sale: <b>And I have not withheld anything</b> for myself <b>in this sale, but</b> if <b>he did not write</b> this clause, <b>conclude from it</b> that the seller <b>withheld</b> something for himself and did not mean to sell everything located within the delineated boundaries.
<b>And</b> in a similar fashion, <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> With regard to one <b>who sells a field to another in a large expanse of fields, even if he delineates for him the external boundaries</b> of the large expanse of fields he did not sell him the entire expanse of fields; rather, <b>he enlarged</b> upon <b>the boundaries for him.</b> That is, the seller did not mean to delineate the precise borders of what was being sold; rather, he delineated the boundaries in a broad manner, giving the general location of the particular field he was selling.
The Gemara inquires: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case? <b>If we say</b> that this is referring to a place <b>where they call a field a field, and an expanse of fields an expanse of fields,</b> and always differentiate between the two terms, it is <b>obvious</b> the he did not intend to sell him the entire expanse of fields, as <b>he sold him a field</b> and <b>did not sell him an expanse of fields. Rather,</b> explain that this is referring to a place <b>where they also call an expanse of fields a field.</b> But in that case, why not say that the seller <b>sold him the entire</b> expanse of fields, since he delineated the external boundaries of the expanse of fields?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> Rav Naḥman’s ruling is <b>necessary</b> in a place <b>where there are</b> some people <b>who call a field a field, and an expanse of fields</b> they call <b>an expanse of fields, but there are also</b> some people <b>who call an expanse of fields a field. Lest you say</b> that since the seller delineated the expanse’s external boundaries, this indicates that he meant to <b>sell him the entire</b> expanse, Rav Naḥman <b>teaches us</b> that this is not so. <b>As,</b> if the seller intended to sell him the entire expanse, <b>he would have written for him</b> in the bill of sale: And <b>I have not withheld anything for myself in this sale, but</b> since <b>he did not write</b> this clause <b>for him, conclude from it</b> that the seller <b>withheld</b> something for himself and did not mean to sell everything located within the delineated boundaries.
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> it was <b>necessary</b> for Rav Naḥman to teach the <i>halakha</i> in both cases, even though the two rulings appear to be the same. <b>As had he taught us</b> the <i>halakha</i> only in the case of the <b>residence,</b> that he did not sell him the entire building even if he delineated the building’s external boundaries, I might have said that this is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that this,</b> the residence, has <b>a discrete use,</b> separate from that of the rest of the building, <b>and that,</b> the building, has <b>a discrete use. But</b> as for <b>an expanse of fields, all of which has a single use,</b> since it can be sown with grain in its entirety, <b>say</b> that the seller <b>sold him the entire</b> expanse.
<b>And had</b> Rav Naḥman <b>taught us</b> the <i>halakha</i> only in the case of <b>an expanse of fields,</b> that he did not sell him the entire expanse even if he delineated its external boundaries, I might have said that this is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the seller <b>had no</b> way <b>to delineate</b> the particular field’s boundaries, since all of the fields are similar, and they all belong to the seller. <b>But</b> as for <b>a residence, with regard to which</b> the seller <b>had</b> a way <b>to delineate</b> its borders, through the use of descriptive terms that would isolate it from the rest of the building, <b>but he did not delineate</b> them, I might say that <b>he sold him the entire</b> building. Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> to mention both cases explicitly.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that which Rav Mari, son of the daughter of Shmuel, said in the name of Abaye: One who sells something to another must write for him</b> in the bill of sale: <b>I have not withheld anything for myself in this sale. In accordance with whose</b> opinion is that? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman,</b> who says that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that even when the seller delineates the boundaries of what he is selling, he does not necessarily mean to sell everything included within those boundaries. Inserting this clause in the bill of sale removes uncertainties that could lead to conflict.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who said to another: I am selling you land of the house of Ḥiyya,</b> but <b>there were two</b> plots of <b>land that were called</b> that <b>of the house of Ḥiyya,</b> and the Sages deliberated as to whether both were included in this sale or only one. <b>Rav Ashi said: He said to him</b> that he was selling him <b>one</b> plot of land, and <b>he did not say to him</b> that he was selling him <b>two</b> plots of land, as he employed a singular term. Therefore, only one is included in the sale.
<b>And if he said to him:</b> I am selling you <b>fields, without specifying</b> how many, <b>the minimum</b> number of fields that would justify being called <b>fields</b> in the plural is <b>two,</b> and therefore the seller has to give the buyer only two of his fields, even if he owns many fields. <b>And if he said to him:</b> I am selling you <b>all</b> of my <b>fields,</b> what he means is that he is selling him <b>all the fields that he owns, excluding</b> his <b>orchards [<i>bustanei</i>] and vineyards. And if he said to him:</b> I am selling you my <b>landed property,</b> what he means is that he is selling him <b>even</b> his <b>orchards and vineyards,</b> but <b>excluding</b> his <b>houses and</b> Canaanite <b>slaves.</b>

Daf 62a

<b>And if he said to him:</b> I am selling you my <b>property,</b> it means that he is selling him <b>even</b> his <b>houses and</b> his Canaanite <b>slaves.</b>
§ The Gemara continues its examination of the concept of delineating boundaries in a wide manner, and considers the following case: If in the bill of sale the seller <b>delineated one boundary line</b> on one side of the field <b>long, and the other boundary line</b> on the opposite side of the field he delineated <b>short, Rav said:</b> The buyer <b>acquires only</b> a width of land <b>corresponding to the short</b> border, as it is assumed that the short boundary line delineates the actual size of the field that was sold to him, while the long boundary line was merely intended to point to the field under discussion. That is to say, the seller delineated the boundaries in a broad manner, but did not intend to include everything found within those boundaries in the sale.
<b>Rav Kahana and Rav Asi said to Rav: But let him</b> also <b>acquire the triangular plot [<i>rosh tor</i>]</b> bounded by the diagonal line connecting the end of the short border and the end of the long border. <b>Rav was silent</b> and did not respond.
<b>And Rav concedes</b> that <b>where there is a boundary line</b> defined by the fields <b>of Reuven and Shimon on one side</b> of the field being sold, <b>and a boundary line</b> defined by the fields <b>of Levi and Yehuda on the other side,</b> and in the bill of sale the seller describes the field being sold as bordered by the fields of Reuven and Shimon on one side but mentions only the field of Levi on the other side, <b>since</b> had he intended to sell only half the field <b>he should have written for</b> the buyer in the bill of sale that the field is bordered by the field <b>of Reuven</b> on the one side, which is <b>opposite</b> that <b>of Levi</b> on the other, <b>or</b> by the field <b>of Shimon</b> on the one side, which is <b>opposite</b> that <b>of Yehuda</b> on the other, <b>but he did not write</b> that <b>for him,</b> one can <b>conclude from it that he is telling him</b> that he is selling him not only the area between the fields of Reuven and Levi, but also <b>the triangular plot</b> bounded by the diagonal line connecting the end of Shimon’s field to the end of Levi’s field.
The Gemara continues: If the field being sold is <b>bounded by</b> the fields of <b>Reuven</b> on <b>the east and the west, and</b> it is <b>bounded by</b> the fields of <b>Shimon</b> on <b>the north and the south,</b> it is not enough to designate the field for the buyer as the field between the fields of Reuven and Shimon, but <b>it is necessary to write for him</b> in the bill of sale that the field is <b>bounded by</b> the fields of <b>Reuven</b> on <b>two sides, and</b> it is <b>bounded by</b> the fields of <b>Shimon</b> on <b>two sides.</b> Otherwise, all that the buyer acquires is a triangular plot bounded by one of Reuven’s fields and one of Shimon’s fields, and the boundary is the diagonal line connecting the end of Reuven’s field to the end of Shimon’s field.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>If</b> the seller <b>defined for</b> the buyer only <b>the corners</b> of the field being sold, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does this mean that he is selling him only the corners of the field or the entire field marked by those corners? A second dilemma was also raised: If he defined the boundaries of the field in a shape <b>resembling</b> the Greek letter <b>gamma [<i>gam</i>],</b> or the English letter L, noting the boundaries on two adjacent sides that meet at a right angle, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does this mean that he is selling him the entire field, or only the triangular plot marked by those boundaries and the diagonal line running from the end of one to the end of the other?

Daf 62b

A third dilemma was also raised before the Sages: If the seller defined the boundaries of the property he is selling <b>in an alternating</b> fashion, mentioning only some of the fields bordering each side of the field being sold, while omitting others, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? No resolution was found for these questions, and these dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The Gemara raises a similar dilemma. If, in the bill of sale, the seller <b>delineated for</b> the buyer the field’s <b>first boundary,</b> its <b>second boundary, and</b> its <b>third boundary, but he did not delineate</b> its <b>fourth boundary</b> at all, <b>Rav says:</b> The buyer <b>acquires the entire</b> field, <b>except for</b> the one furrow along which <b>the fourth boundary</b> runs, which is usually differentiated in some way from the field itself. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> The buyer acquires <b>even</b> the furrow along which <b>the fourth boundary</b> runs. <b>And Rav Asi says: He acquires only</b> the width of <b>one furrow along the entire</b> perimeter of the three boundaries specified by the seller.
The Gemara explains Rav Asi’s opinion: He <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, who said</b> that by failing to delineate the fourth boundary, the seller <b>withheld</b> some part of the field, i.e., one furrow, for himself. But Rav Asi takes this further <b>and</b> says that <b>since he withheld</b> some part of the field for himself <b>at the</b> fourth <b>boundary, he withheld also</b> some portion <b>of the entire</b> field, and therefore the buyer acquires only that which is adjacent to the specified boundaries.
<b>Rava said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that the buyer <b>acquires the entire</b> field <b>except for</b> the one furrow along which <b>the fourth boundary</b> runs, in accordance with the opinion of Rav. <b>And we said</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the fourth boundary <b>is not included</b> within the space between two adjacent boundaries, but rather juts out beyond them. <b>But</b> when <b>it is included</b> within the space delineated by the other boundaries, the buyer <b>acquires</b> it as well.
Rava adds: <b>And even when it is not included</b> in that space, <b>we said</b> that the buyer does not acquire it <b>only</b> in a case <b>where there is a row of trees on it, or it is</b> an area fit for sowing <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed. <b>But</b> where <b>there is no row of trees on it, and it is not</b> an area fit for sowing <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed, the buyer <b>acquires</b> it along with the rest of the field. <b>By inference</b> one derives from here <b>that when</b> the fourth border <b>is included</b> within the space delineated by the two adjacent boundaries, <b>even if there is a row of trees on it and it is</b> an area fit for sowing <b>nine <i>kav</i>,</b> the buyer <b>acquires</b> it.
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that Rava’s ruling and the conclusion drawn from it are as follows: <b>Rava said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that the buyer <b>acquires the entire</b> field, <b>and</b> he acquires <b>even</b> the furrow along which <b>the fourth boundary</b> runs, in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel. <b>And we said</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the fourth boundary <b>is included</b> within the space delineated by the two adjacent boundaries. <b>But</b> when <b>it is not included</b> within those boundaries, the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> it.
Rava adds: <b>And even when it is included</b> within the adjoining boundaries, <b>we said</b> that the buyer acquires it <b>only</b> in a case <b>where there is no row of trees on it, and it is not</b> an area fit for sowing <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed. <b>But</b> where <b>there is a row of trees on it, or it is</b> an area fit for sowing <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed, the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> it. <b>By inference</b> one derives from here <b>that when</b> the fourth boundary <b>is not included</b> within the two adjacent boundaries, <b>even if there is no row of trees on it and it is not</b> an area fit for sowing <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed, the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> it.
<b>We conclude according to both versions</b> of the statement <b>of Rava that</b> even if the seller withheld something for himself along the fourth boundary, <b>he did not withhold anything at all in the field</b> itself. <b>And we also conclude</b> according to both versions <b>that where</b> the fourth boundary <b>is included</b> within the space defined by the two adjacent boundaries, <b>and there is no row of trees on it and it is not</b> an area fit for sowing <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed, the buyer <b>acquires</b> it. And furthermore, we conclude according to both versions that if the fourth boundary <b>is not included</b> within the two adjacent boundaries, <b>and there is a row of trees on it, or it is</b> an area fit for sowing <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed, the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> it.
If the fourth boundary <b>is included</b> within the two adjacent boundaries, <b>and there is</b> a row of trees <b>on it</b> or it is fit for sowing nine <i>kav</i> of seed, or if the fourth boundary <b>is not included</b> within the two adjacent boundaries, <b>and there is no</b> row of trees <b>on it</b> nor is it fit for sowing nine <i>kav</i>, the ruling in these cases <b>was stated in this direction,</b> that the land adjacent to the fourth boundary is acquired by the buyer, <b>and it was stated in that direction,</b> that this land is not acquired by the buyer, depending upon which version of Rava’s statement is accepted. Since there is no clear ruling in these cases, the decision is left to <b>the discretion of the judges,</b> who must rule in accordance with what appears to them to be the intention of the seller.
§ <b>Rabba said:</b> If one owns a field in partnership with another, and he says to a third person: I am selling you <b>the half that I have in this land,</b> he means to sell him <b>half</b> of that field, i.e., his entire share. If he says to the buyer: I am selling you <b>half of the land that I have,</b> he means to sell him <b>one-quarter</b> of that field, i.e., half of his share. <b>Abaye said to him: What is different</b> about <b>this</b> wording <b>and what is different</b> about <b>that</b> wording, that you rule differently in the two cases? Rabba <b>was silent,</b> offering no reply.
<b>Abaye said: I had assumed that since he was silent, he</b> must have <b>accepted</b> my opinion and retracted his statement; <b>but</b> that <b>is not so.</b> As on another occasion <b>I saw certain bills</b> of sale <b>that issued from</b> my <b>Master’s house,</b> that is, they were issued under the auspices of my master Rabba, <b>in which it was written: The half that I have in this land,</b> and it was clear from another clause in the bill that <b>half</b> of the field was being sold. And there was another bill of sale in which it was written: <b>Half of the land that I have,</b> and it was clear from another clause in the bill that <b>one-quarter</b> of the field was being sold.
<b>And Rabba</b> also <b>said:</b> If one sold land to another and delineated boundaries on three sides of the field, and with regard to the fourth side he wrote in the bill of sale: <b>The boundary</b> of the field is <b>the land through which</b> the field <b>is halved,</b> he has sold him <b>half</b> of the field. If he writes with regard to the fourth boundary: <b>The boundary</b> of the field is <b>the land from which</b> a plot <b>can be set apart,</b> he has sold him only an area fit for sowing <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed, as that is the minimum size of a plot of land defined as a field.
<b>Abaye said to him: What is different</b> about <b>this</b> wording, <b>and what is different</b> about <b>that</b> wording, that you rule differently in the two cases? Rabba <b>was silent,</b> and did not respond. The Sages <b>understood from this</b> silence that Abaye understood that Rabba retracted his ruling and conceded that in both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, the buyer acquires <b>half</b> of the field.

Daf 63a

<b>But</b> that <b>is not so, as Rav Yeimar bar Shelemya said:</b> The matter <b>was explained to me by Abaye,</b> as follows: <b>Whether</b> the seller writes with regard to the fourth boundary: <b>The boundary</b> of the field is <b>the land through which</b> the field <b>is halved, or</b> he writes: <b>The boundary</b> of the field is <b>the land through which</b> a plot <b>can be set apart, if he said to</b> the buyer: <b>These are its boundaries,</b> he has sold him <b>half</b> of the field. But if <b>he did not say to</b> the buyer: <b>These are its boundaries,</b> he has sold him only an area fit for sowing <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed.
§ The Gemara raises a question about a similar case: <b>It</b> is <b>obvious</b> that if one <b>said: So-and-so should share in my property,</b> he means to give him <b>half</b> of the property. If he said: <b>Give so-and-so a portion of my property, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? What portion of the property must he give him?
<b>Ravina bar Kisi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof concerning the <i>halakha</i> in this case, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who says: Give so-and-so a portion of</b> my <b>cistern</b> for his water needs, <b>Sumakhos says:</b> He must give him <b>not less than one-quarter</b> of the water in the cistern. If he qualifies his words and says: Give so-and-so a portion of my cistern’s water <b>for</b> his <b>barrel,</b> he must give him <b>not less than one-eighth</b> of the water. If he says: Give him a portion <b>for</b> his <b>pot,</b> he must give him <b>not less than one-twelfth</b> of the water. And if he says: Give him <b>for</b> his <b>cup,</b> he must give him <b>not less than one-sixteenth</b> of the water. In any event, this <i>baraita</i> indicates that the unqualified phrase: Give so-and-so a portion, should be understood to mean: Give him one-quarter.
The Gemara now considers another case in which the seller withholds something for himself in a sale. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a Levite who sold a field to an Israelite and said to him:</b> I am selling you this field <b>on the condition that the first tithe</b> from the produce growing in the field, which must be given to a Levite, is <b>mine,</b> and it will be given to me every year and not to any other Levite, <b>the first tithe is his. And if he said:</b> I am selling you the field on the condition that the tithe will be given <b>to me and to my sons,</b> then if <b>he dies,</b> the buyer <b>must give</b> the tithe <b>to his sons.</b>
<b>But if</b> the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer: This stipulation will remain in force <b>as long as this field is in your possession,</b> then if the buyer <b>sold it and</b> afterward <b>bought it</b> back <b>again,</b> the seller <b>has no</b> claim <b>on him.</b> Since the field left the buyer’s possession in the interim, the seller no longer has a claim to the tithe.
The Gemara challenges the <i>halakha</i> taught in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Why</b> should the seller ever have a right to the tithe after he has sold the field? After all, <b>a person cannot transfer ownership</b> of <b>an object that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world.</b> How, then, can the seller acquire a portion of the produce that does not yet exist? The Gemara answers that <b>since</b> the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer: I am selling you this field <b>on the condition that the first tithe</b> is <b>mine,</b> it is as if <b>he withheld the site</b> where the <b>tithe</b> is grown for himself when he sold the field, and that site already exists.
<b>Reish Lakish said: That is to say</b> that with regard to one <b>who sells a house to another and says to him:</b> I am selling you this house <b>on the condition that the upper story [<i>deyota</i>] is mine, the upper story is his.</b>

Daf 63b

<b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> did Reish Lakish say this? In any case the upper story is his, as when he sold the house, it was only the lower story that he sold to the buyer. <b>Rav Zevid says:</b> He said this to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>that if</b> the seller <b>wishes to extend</b> from the upper story <b>projections</b> over the courtyard, which was included in the sale, <b>he may extend</b> them. <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> He said this to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>that if</b> this upper story collapses and the seller <b>wishes to build an upper story on top of it</b> to replace it, <b>he may build</b> it.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> according <b>to Rav Zevid, this</b> explanation is consistent with <b>that which</b> Reish Lakish <b>teaches,</b> which begins with: <b>That is to say.</b> As according to Rav Zevid, Reish Lakish infers from the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> about tithes that even though the seller of the house did not explicitly withhold anything for himself, the court interprets his use of his superfluous stipulation as an indication that he wished to withhold for himself the space over the courtyard for the projections. <b>But</b> according <b>to Rav Pappa, what</b> did Reish Lakish mean when he said his statement that begins with the phrase: <b>That is to say?</b> The seller’s right to rebuild the upper story after it collapses is not derived from the superfluous stipulation that he attached to the transaction, and it is not inferred from the <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara concludes: Indeed, Rav Pappa’s interpretation is <b>difficult,</b> as it does not account for the wording of Reish Lakish’s statement.
§ The Gemara discusses what is included in the wordings of various contracts. <b>Rav Dimi from Neharde’a said:</b> Concerning <b>this one who sells a house to another</b> and wants the sale to include the entire property, <b>even if he writes for</b> the buyer in the bill of sale: I am selling you <b>the depth and the height</b> of the house, he <b>must</b> also <b>write for him: Acquire for yourself</b> the property <b>from the depth of the earth up to the height of the sky. What is the reason</b> for this addition? The reason is <b>that</b> the buyer <b>does not acquire the depth and the height</b> of the property <b>without</b> explicit <b>specification,</b> and therefore, unless the matter has been explicitly stipulated, the buyer may not dig under the house or build above it. The words: <b>The depth and the height, effect the acquisition of the depth and the height</b> of the house for the buyer, allowing him to dig below or build above the house. <b>And</b> the additional phrase: <b>From the depth of the earth up to the height of the sky, effects the acquisition of the pit and the cistern and the tunnels</b> associated with the house.
The Gemara proposes: <b>Let us say</b> that the mishna (64a) <b>supports</b> Rav Dimi’s opinion: One who sells a house has sold <b>neither the pit nor the cistern, even if he writes for</b> the buyer in the bill of sale that he is selling <b>him the depth and the height</b> of the house. <b>As if it enters your mind</b> to say that the buyer <b>acquires the depth and the height</b> of the house even <b>without</b> the <b>specification</b> that the depth and the height of the house are included in the sale, <b>let</b> the phrase <b>the depth and the height effect the acquisition of the pit and the cistern and the tunnels,</b> as he attached an additional stipulation to the transaction. The Gemara rejects this opinion: The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>did not write</b> these words <b>for him.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> this line of reasoning is difficult, as the mishna explicitly <b>teaches</b> that the pit and the cistern are not sold <b>even if</b> the seller <b>writes for</b> the buyer that he is selling <b>him</b> the depth and the height of the house. The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Even though</b> the seller <b>did not write</b> these words <b>for him</b> in the bill of sale, <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>acquiring the depth and the height</b> of the house, <b>it is considered as if he wrote</b> them, as it is assumed that they were omitted by accident. By contrast, <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>acquiring the pit and the cistern and the tunnels, if</b> the seller explicitly <b>wrote for him</b> the words <b>the depth and the height,</b> the buyer <b>acquires</b> them, <b>but if he did not write</b> that phrase in the bill of sale, the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> them. No proof can be derived from this mishna.
§ The Gemara now considers a different mishna. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was taught in the mishna (61a): One who sells his house without explicitly stating what is included in the sale has <b>not</b> sold <b>the roof</b> along with the house <b>when it has a parapet ten handbreadths high,</b> as such a roof is considered a separate entity and is not included in the sale of the house.

Daf 64a

<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that when a house is sold <b>without specification,</b> the buyer <b>acquires the depth and the height</b> of the house, then even <b>when</b> it has a parapet <b>ten handbreadths high, what of it?</b> Why shouldn’t the buyer acquire the roof? The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the parapet <b>is ten handbreadths high,</b> the roof <b>is significant</b> in its own right, and therefore, unless it is specifically included in the sale, the buyer does not acquire such a roof along with the house.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof, <b>as Reish Lakish says: That is to say</b> that with regard to one <b>who sells a house to another and says to him:</b> I am selling you this house <b>on the condition that the upper story is mine, the upper story is his. And</b> in the Gemara’s examination of Reish Lakish’s statement, <b>we said: With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> did Reish Lakish say this? In any case the upper story is his, as when he sold the house it was only the lower story that he sold to the buyer. <b>Rav Zevid says:</b> He said this to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>that if</b> the seller <b>wishes to extend from</b> the upper story <b>projections</b> over the courtyard, which was included in the sale, <b>he may extend</b> them. <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> He said this to teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>that if</b> this upper story collapses and the seller <b>wishes to build an upper story on top of it</b> to replace it, <b>he may build</b> it.
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that when a house is sold <b>without specification,</b> the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> the depth and the height of a house, Rav Pappa’s statement is puzzling. As <b>why do I</b> need the seller to stipulate that he is selling the house <b>on the condition</b> that the upper story is his when in any event the space above the house remains in the seller’s possession? The Gemara answers: Stipulating that he is selling the house <b>on the condition</b> that the upper story is his <b>benefits him</b> in <b>that if</b> the upper story <b>collapses, he</b> may <b>rebuild it.</b> Without this stipulation the seller could not rebuild it, even if the sale did not include the depth and the height of the house.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who sells a house without specification has sold <b>neither the pit nor the cistern [<i>dut</i>], even if he writes for</b> the buyer in the bill of sale that he is selling <b>him the depth and the height</b> of the house, as anything that is not part of the house, like pits and cisterns, must be explicitly mentioned in the contract or else they remain in the seller’s possession. <b>And</b> therefore the seller <b>must purchase for himself a path</b> through the buyer’s domain to reach whatever remains his, because he has sold the area of the house along with the house itself, and he no longer has permission to walk there. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis say:</b> The seller <b>need not purchase for himself a path</b> through the buyer’s domain, as this is certainly included in what he has withheld for himself from the sale.
<b>And Rabbi Akiva concedes that when</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer in the bill of sale: I am selling you this house <b>apart from</b> the pit and the cistern, <b>he need not purchase for himself a path</b> through the buyer’s domain. Since the seller unnecessarily emphasized that the pit and the cistern are not included in the sale, he presumably intended to reserve for himself the right of access to them.
If the seller kept the house, but <b>sold</b> the pit and the cistern <b>to another, Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The buyer <b>need not purchase for himself a path</b> through the seller’s domain to reach what he has bought. <b>But the Rabbis say: He must purchase for himself a path</b> through the seller’s domain.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> It is related that <b>Ravina</b> once <b>sat</b> and examined the matter <b>and posed a difficulty: A pit is</b> the same as <b>a cistern.</b> Why, then, was it necessary to mention both of them? <b>Rava Tosfa’a said to Ravina: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to this question, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Both a pit and a cistern</b> are dug out <b>in the ground;</b> the difference is <b>only</b> that <b>a pit</b> is constructed <b>through digging</b> alone, <b>while a cistern</b> is subsequently finished on the inside <b>by building</b> masonry walls. It is similarly related that <b>Rav Ashi</b> once <b>sat and posed a difficulty: A pit is</b> the same as <b>a cistern. Mar Kashisha, son of Rav Ḥisda, said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution to this question, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Both a pit and a cistern</b> are dug <b>in the ground,</b> the difference is <b>only</b> that <b>a pit</b> is constructed <b>through digging</b> alone, <b>while a cistern</b> is subsequently finished on the inside <b>by building</b> masonry walls.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> the seller <b>must purchase for himself a path</b> through the buyer’s domain; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis say:</b> The seller <b>need not</b> purchase such a path. <b>What, is it not about this</b> issue, which will immediately be explained, that Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis <b>disagree?</b>

Daf 64b

<b>As Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously,</b> so that whatever is not explicitly excluded from the sale is assumed to be sold, <b>while the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>one who sells, sells sparingly,</b> so that whatever is not explicitly included in the sale is assumed to be unsold. <b>And</b> perhaps <b>that which is also stated generally: Rabbi Akiva</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as he says</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously,</b> is derived <b>from here.</b>
The Gemara rejects this opinion and asks: <b>From where</b> do you arrive at such a conclusion? <b>Perhaps</b> Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis do not disagree whether, in principle, a person who sells, sells generously or sparingly, but rather their disagreement is limited to this specific case. As <b>Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>a person does not want to spend his money</b> on the purchase of a house <b>and</b> then have <b>others tread upon his</b> property, and therefore he says that the seller must purchase for himself a path through the buyer’s domain to reach his pit. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>a person does not want to receive money</b> for the sale of his house <b>and</b> then have to <b>fly through the air</b> in order to reach his pit, and therefore they say that the seller presumably withheld for himself a path to his pit.
<b>Rather,</b> the proof is <b>from the last clause</b> of the mishna, which states: If the seller kept the house but <b>sold</b> the pit and the cistern <b>to another, Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The buyer <b>need not purchase for himself a path</b> through the seller’s domain. <b>But the Rabbis say: He must purchase for himself a path</b> through the seller’s domain. The <i>tanna’im</i> seem to disagree as to whether a person who sells, sells generously or sparingly.
The Gemara rejects this proof as well: <b>Perhaps they disagree about</b> the following: <b>Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>we follow the intention of the buyer,</b> as we assume that he would not have bought the pit if he would have to fly through the air to get there. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>we follow the intention of the seller,</b> as presumably he would not have sold the pit if the buyer had the right to tread upon the seller’s property to reach it.
<b>Rather,</b> the proof that these <i>tanna’im</i> disagree whether one who sells, sells generously or sparingly is <b>from this</b> mishna (71a), which teaches: One who sells a field, even if he states that he is selling everything in it to the buyer, has sold <b>neither the cistern, nor the winepress, nor the dovecote, whether</b> it is <b>abandoned or utilized,</b> as these items are not part of the field itself. <b>And</b> the seller <b>must purchase</b> for himself <b>a path</b> through the buyer’s domain to reach whatever remains his. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. And the Rabbis say:</b> The seller <b>need not</b> purchase a path through the buyer’s domain.
The Gemara explains the proof: <b>Why do I need this</b> ruling <b>as well,</b> seeing that this case involving the sale of a field appears to be identical to that involving the sale of a house? <b>Rather, is it not teaching us that Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously,</b> and therefore the seller must purchase for himself a path to his property, <b>while the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>one who sells, sells sparingly,</b> and therefore the purchase of such a path is not necessary?
The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>Perhaps</b> the first mishna <b>taught us</b> this dispute with regard to <b>a house, and</b> the later mishna <b>teaches us</b> this dispute with regard to <b>a field. And</b> while this may seem redundant, both rulings are <b>necessary, as had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> only with regard to <b>a house,</b> I would have said that the buyer is particular about people passing through his house, <b>because he desires privacy</b> there. And it is for this reason that Rabbi Akiva says that in the absence of an explicit stipulation, the seller must purchase for himself a path to the pit. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a field,</b> which is exposed to all, <b>say</b> that the buyer is <b>not</b> concerned about privacy.
<b>And,</b> conversely, <b>had</b> the mishna <b>taught us</b> this <i>halakha</i> only with regard to <b>a field,</b> I would have said that the buyer is particular about people passing through his field, <b>because treading</b> upon the field <b>is detrimental to it.</b> And it is for this reason that Rabbi Akiva says that the seller must purchase for himself a path to the pit. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a house,</b> which is not adversely affected by treading through it, <b>say</b> that the buyer is <b>not</b> opposed to the seller passing through.
<b>Rather,</b> the proof that Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis disagree whether one who sells, sells generously or sparingly is <b>from the latter clause</b> of that mishna (71a), which teaches: But if the seller kept the field but <b>sold</b> the cistern and winepress <b>to another</b> person, <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The buyer <b>need not purchase for himself a path</b> through the seller’s domain to reach what he has bought, since a seller sells generously. <b>But the Rabbis say: He must</b> purchase for himself a path through the seller’s domain.
The Gemara explains the proof: <b>Why do I also</b> need <b>this,</b> seeing as <b>this</b> case involving the sale of a pit or a winepress in a field <b>is</b> identical to <b>that</b> involving the sale of a pit or a cistern in a house? <b>Rather, is it not teaching us that Rabbi Akiva holds</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously, while the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>one who sells, sells sparingly?</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the latter clauses of these <i>mishnayot</i> that this is so.
<b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagree about how the <i>halakha</i> should be decided with regard to this issue. <b>Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says:</b>

Daf 65a

<b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis, while Rav Yirmeya bar Abba</b> says that <b>Shmuel says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva. Rav Yirmeya bar Abba said to Rav Huna: But many times I said before Rav</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, and never did he say anything to me,</b> which indicates that he holds that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva and not that of the Rabbis. Rav Huna <b>said to him: How did you teach</b> the mishna before Rav? Rav Yirmeya bar Abba <b>said to him: I taught</b> it with <b>the opposite</b> attributions, that is to say, the opinion that is attributed in the mishna to Rabbi Akiva, I would teach in the name of the Rabbis. Rav Huna said to him: <b>Due to that</b> reason, <b>he never said anything to you,</b> as Rav agreed with the version that you attributed to Rabbi Akiva.
With regard to the opinions of Rav and Shmuel, <b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Shall we say</b> that Rav and Shmuel, in their opinions stated with regard to this matter, each <b>follow their</b> general lines of <b>reasoning,</b> as they appear to have disagreed about this same issue in another context as well?
<b>As Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>brothers who divided</b> their father’s estate between them, <b>they do not have</b> a right of <b>way against each other,</b> i.e., to walk through the other’s property to reach his own, even though this is how the place was used in their father’s lifetime; <b>nor</b> do they have the right of <b>ladders against each other,</b> i.e., the right to set up a ladder in the other’s property in order to get to his own; <b>nor</b> do they have the right of <b>windows against each other,</b> i.e., the right to prevent the other from building a wall facing his windows; <b>nor</b> do they have the right of <b>a water channel against each other,</b> i.e., the right to pass a water channel through the other’s property.
Rav Naḥman continues: <b>And be careful with these</b> rulings, <b>since they are established <i>halakhot</i>. And Rav says: They do</b> retain all of these privileges. Consequently, Rav and Shmuel appear to be following their general lines of reasoning here, as Shmuel holds that when the brothers, who are like sellers, divide their father’s estate, they transfer property to each other generously without retaining privileges in each other’s property, while Rav holds that they transfer the property sparingly.
The Gemara comments: Nevertheless, it was <b>necessary</b> to teach this disagreement in both cases, as the <i>halakha</i> in the one case cannot be derived from the <i>halakha</i> in the other. <b>As had we been taught</b> this dispute only <b>in that</b> case, of the brothers who divided their father’s estate, I would have said that only <b>in that</b> case <b>does Rav say</b> that they retain all of the earlier privileges, <b>because</b> one brother can <b>say to</b> the other: <b>I wish to live in</b> this house <b>just as my ancestors,</b> who had all of those privileges, <b>lived in it. Know</b> that there is substance to this claim, <b>as it is written: “Instead of your fathers shall be your sons”</b> (Psalms 45:17). <b>But in this</b> case of an ordinary house sale, <b>say that he concedes to Shmuel</b> that a seller sells generously.
<b>And if</b> the dispute <b>was stated</b> only <b>in this</b> case of an ordinary house sale, I would have said that only <b>in this</b> case <b>does Shmuel say</b> that a seller sells generously and does not withhold a path for himself, <b>but in that</b> case, of the brothers who divided their father’s estate, <b>say that he concedes to Rav</b> that the desire to live there just as his ancestors did supersedes the seller’s general tendency to sell generously. Therefore, it was <b>necessary</b> to teach this dispute in both cases.
As for the ruling itself, <b>Rav Naḥman,</b> who was a disciple of Shmuel, <b>said to Rav Huna:</b> Is <b>the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with our opinion, or is the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with your opinion?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with your opinion, as you are near the gate of the Exilarch, where the judges are</b> frequently <b>found,</b> and therefore you are more proficient in monetary law.
§ <b>It was stated:</b> If there are <b>two residences, one</b> situated <b>behind the other,</b> and the owner transferred ownership of the <b>two of them,</b> each one to a different person, <b>by means of</b> a <b>sale,</b> or if he transferred ownership of the <b>two of them,</b> each to a different person, <b>as a gift, they do not have</b> a right of <b>way against each other.</b> That is, the one who acquired the inner residence may not pass through the outer residence, since each of them received equal privileges from the previous owner. And <b>all the more so</b> is this the <i>halakha</i> if <b>the outer</b> residence was transferred <b>by means of a gift, and the inner</b> residence was transferred <b>by means of a sale,</b> as it may be assumed that a gift is made in a more generous manner than is a sale.
As for the case where the <b>outer</b> residence was transferred <b>by means of a sale, and the inner</b> residence was transferred <b>by means of a gift,</b> some Sages at first <b>understood from here</b> that <b>they do not have a</b> right of <b>way against each other,</b> that is, that the recipient of the inner residence may not pass through the outer residence.
<b>But</b> that <b>is not so,</b> as <b>didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (71a): <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that these items are excluded, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to one who sells</b> a field, <b>but with regard to one who gives</b> it away as <b>a gift,</b> it is assumed that <b>he gives all of it,</b> including everything found in the field. <b>Apparently, one who gives</b> property <b>as a gift gives</b> it more <b>generously</b> than does one who sells it, as gifts are generally given to friends to whom one wishes to transfer as many privileges as possible. <b>Here too,</b> then, <b>one who gives</b> property <b>as a gift gives</b> it more <b>generously</b> than does one who sells it, and so the recipient of the inner residence acquires a right of way through the outer apartment.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <b>who sells a house has,</b> as part of the sale, <b>sold</b> also <b>the door, but not the key. He has sold the mortar that is fixed</b> in the ground, <b>but not the portable</b> one. <b>He has sold the</b> immovable <b>lower millstone [<i>ha’itzterobil</i>], but not the</b> portable <b>upper stone [<i>hakelet</i>],</b> the funnel into which one pours the grain to be ground. <b>And</b> he has sold <b>neither the oven nor the double stove,</b> as they are deemed movable. <b>When</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer: I am selling you <b>it, and everything that is in it,</b>

Daf 65b

<b>all these</b> components <b>are sold</b> as part of the sale of the house.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna</b> that distinguishes between different types of household items <b>is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir. As if</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, doesn’t he say</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (78b): If <b>one sold a vineyard, he has sold</b> all of <b>the utensils of the vineyard,</b> including the movable ones? The same should be true for the sale of a house.
The Gemara answers: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishna was taught in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as a distinction can be made between the two cases. <b>There,</b> in the case of a vineyard, the reference is to utensils that are <b>fixed</b> in the vineyard and never removed from it, and therefore they are included in the sale, while <b>here,</b> in the case of a house, the mishna is referring to utensils that are <b>not fixed</b> in the house, and therefore they are not part of the sale. The Gemara objects: <b>But doesn’t</b> the mishna <b>teach</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>a key in similar fashion to</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>the door,</b> indicating that <b>just as a door</b> is <b>fixed</b> in the house, <b>so too, a key</b> is <b>fixed</b> in the house? <b>Rather, it is clear</b> that <b>the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 3:1): One <b>who sells a house has sold the door and the door bolt and the lock, but</b> he has <b>not</b> sold <b>the key. He has sold the mortar that was hollowed out</b> of the ground <b>but not</b> the mortar <b>that was fixed</b> to the ground after its construction. <b>He has sold the</b> immovable <b>lower millstone but not the</b> portable <b>upper stone.</b> And he has sold <b>neither the oven, nor the double stove, nor the hand mill. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The principle is that <b>any</b> item <b>attached to the ground is</b> considered <b>like the ground</b> and included in the sale.
<b>When</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer: I am selling you <b>it and everything that is in it, all these</b> components <b>are sold</b> along with the house. <b>Both</b> in <b>this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case <b>he did not sell the pit or the cistern or the gallery,</b> as they are considered separate entities that are not at all part of the house.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A duct that one hollowed out and afterward attached</b> to the ground or to a building <b>invalidates a ritual bath</b> through the water it channels to the bath. The water in a ritual bath must be gathered directly from rain or a stream, not drawn with vessels. If one hollowed out a log and used it to channel water into the bath, this is considered drawn water, as he used a vessel. By contrast, if <b>one attached it</b> first <b>and afterward hollowed it out, it does not invalidate the ritual bath.</b> Before the log was hollowed out, it was already attached to and considered part of the ground, and therefore the act of hollowing it out does not turn it into a vessel. The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is this? It appears to be <b>neither</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, nor</b> that of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the question: To <b>which</b> opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> is this referring? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> in the aforementioned <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> the sale of <b>a house,</b> that any item attached to the ground is considered part of the house and is sold along with it, there is a difficulty. As <b>perhaps this is the reasoning</b> employed in the dispute with regard to the sale of a house, <b>that Rabbi Eliezer holds</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously</b> anything that is attached to the ground, <b>while the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>one who sells, sells sparingly,</b> selling only utensils that serve an intrinsic function in the house and nothing else, even if they are attached to the ground. But this teaches us nothing about the opinions of Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis with respect to a ritual bath.
<b>But rather,</b> the reference must be to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer concerning a beehive. As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 10:7): With regard to <b>a beehive</b> attached to the ground by clay, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: It is like land, and</b> therefore <b>one may write a document that prevents the Sabbatical Year from canceling an outstanding debt [<i>prosbol</i>]</b> based <b>upon it.</b> Such a document cannot be written unless the borrower owns some land, and a beehive is considered like land for this purpose.

Daf 66a

<b>And</b> such a beehive <b>is not susceptible to ritual impurity</b> as long as it is fixed <b>in its place. And one who removes</b> honey <b>from it on Shabbat</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering,</b> as he is likened to one who harvests produce attached to the ground.
<b>But the Rabbis say:</b> Such a beehive <b>is not like land, and</b> therefore <b>one may not write a <i>prosbol</i></b> based <b>upon it, and it is susceptible to ritual impurity</b> even when it is fixed <b>in its place, and one who removes</b> honey <b>from it on Shabbat</b> is <b>exempt</b> from bringing a sin-offering. This mishna suggests that Rabbi Eliezer holds that a vessel that was affixed to the ground is considered like land for all purposes. This contradicts the <i>baraita</i> that states that if one hollowed out a pipe and then affixed it to the ground, it is still considered a vessel, and water flowing through it is considered drawn water that invalidates a ritual bath. This indicates that the <i>baraita</i> was not taught in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer.
The Gemara rejects this opinion, stating that <b>there,</b> in the mishna, Rabbi Eliezer treats the beehive like land for <b>the reason that Rabbi Elazar stated,</b> and not because he holds that all vessels that are affixed to the ground are considered like land. <b>As Rabbi Elazar stated: What is the reasoning for</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Eliezer</b> with regard to one who removes honey from a beehive? His rationale is <b>as it is written:</b> “And he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand <b>and dipped it in the honeycomb [<i>ya’arat hadevash</i>]”</b> (I Samuel 14:27).
Rabbi Eliezer understands that since the Hebrew words used here for honeycomb can also mean honey forest, the verse comes to teach that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>a forest, one who picks</b> anything from a tree <b>on Shabbat</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering, so too,</b> with regard to a beehive containing <b>honey, one who removes</b> honey <b>from it on Shabbat</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering,</b> as the beehive is treated like land. Consequently, Rabbi Eliezer relies here on a special derivation, which does not necessarily apply to other vessels. Therefore, nothing can be learned from this about Rabbi Eliezer’s opinion with regard to the pipe in the <i>baraita</i>.
<b>Rather,</b> the reference with regard to the hollowed-out duct must be to the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer concerning</b> a baker’s <b>board</b> on which he kneads the dough, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 15:2): With regard to <b>a baker’s board [<i>daf shel naḥtomin</i>] that was affixed to the wall, Rabbi Eliezer renders</b> it <b>not susceptible to ritual impurity, while the Rabbis render</b> it <b>susceptible to ritual impurity.</b> This seems to indicate that, according to Rabbi Eliezer, anything that is affixed to the ground or to something else that is affixed to the ground is treated like land, and therefore it cannot become ritually impure.
Having concluded that this is the dispute between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis that was referred to previously, the Gemara repeats the question raised earlier about the ruling in the <i>baraita</i> with regard to a duct: <b>Whose</b> opinion is it? It appears to be neither that of Rabbi Eliezer nor that of the Rabbis. As <b>if</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer,</b> then <b>even if one hollowed out</b> a duct <b>and afterward he fixed it</b> to the ground, water flowing through it should not be considered drawn water that invalidates a ritual bath, as according to Rabbi Eliezer, a baker’s board that was first a vessel, but then became fixed in a wall, is treated like land. And <b>if</b> it is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> then <b>even if he</b> first <b>fixed</b> the duct to the ground <b>and</b> only <b>afterward he hollowed it out,</b> the duct should <b>also</b> be treated like a vessel, and the water flowing through it should be considered drawn water, as the Rabbis do not differentiate with regard to the stage at which the baker’s board was affixed to the wall.
The Gemara responds: <b>Actually,</b> one can explain that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, but</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>flat wooden vessels</b> without a receptacle, such as a baker’s board, <b>is different, as</b> they are vessels susceptible to <b>ritual impurity</b> only <b>by rabbinic law,</b> but by Torah law they are not vessels susceptible to ritual impurity. Therefore, Rabbi Eliezer agrees that when the baker’s board is affixed to the wall, it is no longer subject to the rabbinic decree. A hollowed-out duct, however, is a vessel susceptible to ritual impurity by Torah law, and it remains so even if afterward it was affixed to the ground. Therefore, the water flowing through it invalidates a ritual bath.
The Gemara asks: <b>By inference,</b> from the fact that Rabbi Eliezer is more stringent in the case of the duct and distinguishes between a duct that was first hollowed out and only afterward affixed to the ground, and one that was first affixed to the ground and only afterward hollowed out, does it not follow <b>that</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>drawn</b> water, i.e., that drawn water added to a ritual bath that does not already contain the necessary quantity of water invalidates it, applies <b>by Torah law?</b>

Daf 66b

<b>But</b> this is difficult, as <b>we maintain</b> that the <i>halakha</i> that drawn water invalidates a ritual bath applies only by <b>rabbinic</b> decree. <b>And furthermore, doesn’t Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina say</b> that the <b>dispute</b> between Rabbi Eliezer and the Rabbis is <b>with regard to a board of metal,</b> and a metal vessel, even if it is flat and lacks a receptacle, is susceptible to ritual impurity by Torah law? This means that, according to Rabbi Eliezer, even a vessel that is susceptible to ritual impurity by Torah law loses its status as a vessel when it is affixed to the ground. Consequently, the question returns: Whose opinion is cited in the <i>baraita</i> that states that if one first hollowed out a duct and afterward fixed it to the ground, it is still considered a vessel and water flowing through it invalidates a ritual bath, but if he first fixed it to the ground and afterward hollowed it out, the water flowing through it does not invalidate a ritual bath?
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> one can explain that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who deem the baker’s metal board susceptible to ritual impurity even when it is fixed to a wall, <b>but</b> the <i>halakha</i> governing <b>drawn</b> water added to a deficient ritual bath <b>is different,</b> because drawn water invalidates a deficient ritual bath only <b>by rabbinic law,</b> and therefore the Rabbis were lenient.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> then <b>even</b> if one first <b>hollowed out</b> the duct <b>and</b> only <b>afterward fixed it</b> to the ground, water flowing through it should not invalidate the ritual bath <b>as well.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there,</b> where the duct was hollowed out before being affixed to the ground, <b>as</b> the duct <b>had the status of a vessel when</b> it was still <b>detached</b> from the ground, and therefore the Rabbis were not willing to be lenient to such an extent and rule that water flowing through the duct does not invalidate a ritual bath.
§ <b>Rav Yosef raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>rainwater</b> that was falling and the owner consciously <b>desired</b> that it should fall <b>so that it would wash</b> his immovable <b>lower millstones, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to the seeds</b> in the millstones? The verse “But if any water be put upon the seed…it shall be unclean to you” (Leviticus 11:38) teaches that seeds and other food become susceptible to ritual purity only after they have been detached from the ground, and water, or another of the seven liquids specified in the mishna (<i>Makhshirin</i> 6:4), has been put on them. The food must be exposed to the liquid willfully by the owner; that is, he must desire or at least be pleased that the food should become wet. Rav Yosef asks about a case where the owner wants the rain to fall on the millstones: Does that water make the seeds upon which it falls susceptible to ritual impurity?
The Gemara clarifies Rav Yosef’s question: <b>Do not raise this dilemma according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer, who says: Anything attached to the ground</b> has the same legal status <b>as the ground.</b> Since the lower millstones are attached to the ground, they therefore have the same legal status as the ground, and water that falls on the ground, even if it is pleasing to the owner, does not make food susceptible to ritual impurity. <b>When should you raise this dilemma?</b> Raise it <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis, who say:</b> It does <b>not</b> have the same legal status <b>as the ground. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> with respect to imparting susceptibility to ritual impurity? The Gemara concludes: An answer to this question was not found; therefore, the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Rav Neḥemya, son of Rav Yosef, sent</b> a message <b>to Rabba son of Rav Huna the Short at Neharde’a: When this woman</b> bearing this letter <b>comes before you,</b>

Daf 67a

<b>collect for her one-tenth of</b> her father’s <b>estate,</b> in keeping with the rabbinic ordinance that states that if a man dies, his sons are obligated to give his daughter a tenth of his landed properties as a dowry, and collect it <b>even from</b> his immovable <b>lower millstones,</b> as they too are considered landed property. <b>Rav Ashi said: When we were</b> students <b>in Rav Kahana’s house we would collect</b> for this purpose <b>even from the rent of houses;</b> since this money is earned from real estate, it too has the status of landed property and is included in the dowry calculations.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <b>who sells a courtyard</b> without specifying what is included in the sale <b>has sold</b> with it <b>the houses, pits, ditches, and caves</b> found in the courtyard, <b>but</b> he has <b>not</b> sold <b>the movable property. When</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer: I am selling you <b>it and everything that is in it, all these</b> components <b>are sold</b> along with the courtyard, even the movable property. <b>Both</b> in <b>this</b> case, where he executes the sale without specification, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, where he adds the phrase that includes the movable property, <b>he has not sold the bathhouse, nor</b> has he sold <b>the olive press that is in</b> the courtyard, as each is an entity with a discrete purpose and not an integral part of the courtyard. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One <b>who sells a courtyard</b> without specifying what is included in the sale <b>has sold only the airspace,</b> i.e., the open space, <b>of the courtyard,</b> but nothing found in the courtyard, not even the houses.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, 3:1): One <b>who sells a courtyard has sold</b> with it <b>the outer houses</b> that can be accessed directly from the courtyard, <b>and the inner houses</b> that can be entered only via the outer houses, <b>and the area of the sand fields [<i>uveit haḥolsaot</i>].</b> As for the <b>stores,</b> those <b>that open into</b> the courtyard <b>are sold</b> along <b>with it;</b> those that <b>do not open into it,</b> but rather open into the public domain, even if they are located in the courtyard, <b>are not sold</b> along <b>with it;</b> and those that <b>open</b> both <b>into this</b> courtyard <b>and into that</b> other public domain are grouped together with those that open into this courtyard alone, and both <b>these and those are sold with it. Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One <b>who sells a courtyard</b> without specifying what is included in the sale <b>has sold only the open space of the courtyard.</b>
<b>The Master said</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: Stores that <b>open</b> both <b>into this</b> courtyard <b>and into that</b> public domain <b>are sold</b> along <b>with</b> the courtyard. The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> a <i>baraita</i> that states that such stores <b>are not sold with</b> the courtyard? The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i>, that teaches that the stores are sold along with the courtyard, is referring to a case <b>where the majority of their use is from within,</b> i.e., the stores are mainly accessed from within the courtyard, while <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> of Rabbi Ḥiyya, that teaches that the stores are not sold along with the courtyard, is referring to a case <b>where the majority of their use is from without,</b> i.e., the stores are accessed mainly from the public domain.
The mishna teaches, and it was similarly taught in the <i>baraita</i>, that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One <b>who sells a courtyard has sold only the airspace of the courtyard,</b> and he has sold nothing found in the courtyard, not even the houses. To clarify the disagreement between the unattributed opinion in the mishna and Rabbi Eliezer, <b>Rabba said: If</b> the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer that he is selling him <b><i>dirata</i>,</b> i.e., the place of residence, <b>everyone agrees that he means</b> to sell <b>the houses</b> and that they are also included in the sale. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>where he said to him</b> that he is selling him <b><i>darta</i>,</b> i.e., the courtyard. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that <b>he means</b> to sell only <b>the garden,</b> i.e., the space between the houses, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the unattributed first opinion in the mishna, <b>holds</b> that <b>he means</b> to sell also <b>the houses.</b>
<b>Some state</b> a different version of this discussion, according to which <b>Rabba says: If</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer that he is selling him <b><i>darta</i>, everyone agrees that he means</b> to sell also <b>the houses</b> and that they are included in the sale. <b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>where he said to him</b> that he is selling him the <b><i>ḥatzer</i>,</b> the Hebrew term for courtyard. One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Eliezer, <b>holds</b> that when he says <b><i>ḥatzer</i>, he means</b> to sell him only <b>the airspace,</b> i.e., the open space of the courtyard itself, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the unattributed first opinion in the mishna, <b>holds</b> that houses are also included in the sale, just <b>as the courtyard of the Tabernacle</b> included the Tabernacle itself.
§ <b>And Rabba says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If one <b>sold</b> another <b>a sand field</b> for glass making, <b>and a pond</b> for fishing or some other purpose, if the buyer <b>took possession of the sand field</b> in order to finalize the transaction, <b>he has not acquired the pond</b> and must therefore perform a separate act of acquisition for it. Conversely, if <b>he took possession of the pond, he has not acquired the sand field.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Shmuel say:</b> If one <b>sold</b> another <b>ten fields in ten</b> different <b>regions,</b> all in a single bill of sale, <b>once he takes possession of one of them, he has acquired them all;</b> and the two cases seem to be analogous.
The Gemara rejects the parallel: <b>There,</b> in the case of the ten fields, <b>the land is</b> all located in <b>one</b> geographic <b>block, and it all has one use,</b> i.e., to be farmed. The buyer, therefore, acquires all of the fields when he takes possession of one of them, even if they are not adjacent. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the sand field and the pond, <b>this,</b> the sand field, has <b>a distinct use,</b> i.e., to supply sand for glass making, <b>and that,</b> the pond, has <b>a distinct use,</b> i.e., for fishing. Therefore, taking possession of one of them does not effect a transfer of the other.
<b>And some state</b> a different version of the previous discussion.

Daf 67b

<b>Rabba</b> actually <b>said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> If one sold another a sand field and a pond, and the buyer <b>took possession of the sand field, he has</b> also <b>acquired the pond.</b> The Gemara asks: This is <b>obvious, as Shmuel says:</b> If one <b>sold ten fields to</b> another in ten different regions, once he takes possession of one of them, he has acquired them all. The Gemara explains why Rav Naḥman’s statement was nevertheless necessary: It is necessary <b>lest you say</b> that <b>there,</b> in the case of the ten fields, <b>the land is</b> all located in <b>one</b> geographic <b>block</b> with a single use, and therefore all the fields are acquired together. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the sand field and the pond, <b>this,</b> the sand field, has <b>a distinct use, and that,</b> the pond, has a <b>distinct use,</b> and therefore taking possession of one of them should not effect acquisition of the other. Therefore, Rav Naḥman <b>teaches us</b> that if the buyer took possession of the sand field, he has acquired the pond as well.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <b>who sells an olive press</b> without specifying what is included in the sale <b>has sold</b> with it <b>the <i>yam</i> and the <i>memel</i> and the <i>betulot</i>,</b> the immovable elements of the olive press. <b>But he has not sold</b> with it <b>the <i>avirim</i> and the <i>galgal</i> and the <i>kora</i>,</b> the movable utensils of the olive press. <b>When</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer: I am selling you <b>it and everything that is in it, all these</b> components <b>are sold</b> along with the olive press, even the movable utensils. <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One <b>who sells an olive press has sold the <i>kora</i></b> as well, as it is the most fundamental element of the olive press.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara explains the terms used in the mishna. The <b><i>yam</i></b> is the <b>lentil,</b> the round stationary container into which the olives are placed before being crushed. As for the <b><i>memel</i>, Rabbi Abba bar Memel said:</b> This is the <b>crusher,</b> the utensil used to pound and crush the olives. As for the <b><i>betulot</i>, Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> These are the <b>cedar posts [<i>klonsot</i>] that support the beam</b> of the olive press. The <b><i>avirim</i></b> are the <b>pressers,</b> wooden boards that are placed on top of the crushed olives, and upon which the beam is lowered in order to press the olives. The <b><i>galgal</i></b> is the <b><i>ḥumrata</i>,</b> a round stone that is placed on the beam to weigh it down. The <b><i>kora</i></b> is the heavy wooden <b>beam</b> used to press down upon the olives and thereby extract the oil.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, 3:2): One <b>who sells an olive press</b> without specifying what is included in the sale <b>has sold</b> with it <b>the boards</b> that are fixed in place to hold the olives; <b>and the vats</b> for collecting the oil, <b>and the crushers,</b> used to pound and crush the olives before pressing them, <b>and the lower millstone,</b> i.e., the stationary millstone base; <b>but not the upper</b> millstone. <b>But when</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer: I am selling you <b>it and everything that is in it, all these</b> components <b>are sold. Both</b> in <b>this</b> case, where he executes the sale without specification, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, where he adds the phrase that he is selling everything that is in the olive press, <b>he has not sold the</b> wooden <b>boards</b> that are placed on top of the crushed olives when they are being pressed, <b>nor</b> has he sold <b>the sacks, nor</b> has he sold <b>the leather bags</b> for carrying the olives, as these are all movable goods that are not specifically part of the olive press.
<b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> One <b>who sells an olive press has sold the</b> heavy wooden <b>beam</b> used to press down upon the olives, <b>as it is called an olive press [<i>beit habad</i>] only due to</b> this <b>beam,</b> the most essential part of the press, and this beam is otherwise known as a <i>bad</i>.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <b>who sells a bathhouse</b> without specifying what is included in the sale <b>has not sold</b> with it <b>the boards</b> that are placed on the floor, <b>nor</b> has he sold <b>the basins or the curtains [<i>habilaniyot</i>]. When</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer: I am selling you <b>it and everything that is in it, all these</b> components <b>are sold</b> along with the bathhouse. <b>Both</b> in <b>this</b> case, where he executes the sale without specification, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, where he adds the phrase that he is selling everything that is in the bathhouse, <b>he has not sold the tanks of water, nor</b> has he sold <b>the storerooms for wood,</b> as an explicit sales agreement is required for these matters.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, 3:3): One <b>who sells a bathhouse</b> without specifying what is included in the sale <b>has sold</b> with it <b>the storeroom</b> for <b>the boards, and the storeroom</b> for <b>the</b> implements called <b><i>yekamin</i>, and the storeroom for the basins, and the storeroom for the curtains [<i>vilaot</i>], but</b> he has <b>not</b> sold <b>the boards themselves, nor the <i>yekamin</i> themselves, nor the basins themselves, nor the curtains themselves. When</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer: I am selling you <b>it and everything that is in it, all these</b> components <b>are sold</b> along with the bathhouse. <b>Both</b> in <b>this</b> case, where he executes the sale without specification, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, where he adds the phrase that he is selling everything that is in the bathhouse, <b>he has not sold him the pools that supply him with water, whether</b>

Daf 68a

<b>in the summer season or in the rainy season, nor</b> has he sold him <b>the storeroom for the wood. But if</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer: <b>I am selling you the bathhouse and all of its accompaniments, all these</b> components <b>are sold.</b>
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: I am selling you</b> this <b>olive press and all of its accompaniments. There were certain stores outside</b> of the olive press, <b>where,</b> in addition to the ordinary services that these stores provided, <b>sesame seeds would</b> also <b>be spread out</b> to dry before they would be pressed for their oil. The seller and the buyer disagreed about whether these stores were included in the sale, and the buyer <b>came before Rav Yosef,</b> presenting him with his claim to ownership of the stores.
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: We learned</b> in the previously cited <i>baraita</i> that <b>if</b> the seller <b>says</b> to the buyer: <b>I am selling you the bathhouse and all of its accompaniments, all these</b> components <b>are sold.</b> Rav Yosef held that in this case too, the disputed stores were sold. <b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>They are not all sold? Rather,</b> the issue should be resolved as <b>Rav Ashi said: We consider</b> the seller’s statement, and <b>if he said to</b> the buyer: I am selling you <b>the olive press and all of its accompaniments, and these are its boundaries,</b> and he included the area of the stores within those boundaries, the buyer <b>has acquired</b> those stores, <b>but if</b> the seller does <b>not</b> say this, <b>he has not acquired</b> them, as they are not actually part of the olive press.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <b>who sells a city</b> without specifying what is included in the sale <b>has sold</b> with it <b>the houses, the pits,</b> the <b>ditches and caves, the bathhouses and the dovecotes,</b> and <b>the olive presses and <i>beit hashelaḥin</i>,</b> as will be explained in the Gemara, <b>but</b> he has <b>not</b> sold <b>the movable property</b> in the city. <b>But when</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer: I am selling you <b>it and everything that is in it, even if there were cattle and</b> Canaanite <b>slaves in</b> the city, <b>all these</b> entities <b>are sold. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> One <b>who sells a city has sold</b> with it <b>the <i>santar</i>,</b> the meaning of which will be explained in the Gemara.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: Learn from</b> the mishna that the legal status of a Canaanite <b>slave is like</b> that of <b>movable property, as if</b> it is <b>like</b> that of <b>land,</b> the slave <b>should be sold along with the city.</b> Rav Ashi responded: <b>Rather, what</b> do you claim, that the legal status of a Canaanite <b>slave is like</b> that of <b>movable property?</b> If that is the case, <b>what</b> is the meaning of the mishna’s statement that <b>even</b> if there were cattle and Canaanite slaves in the city, they are all sold? This is obvious, as the slaves should be treated no differently than the rest of the city’s movable property.
<b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> You must explain that there <b>is a difference between movable property that moves about</b> by itself, such as slaves, <b>and movable property that does not move about</b> by itself, i.e., inanimate objects. In exactly the same manner, one can claim that <b>even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the legal status of a Canaanite <b>slave is like</b> that of <b>land,</b> there <b>is a difference between land that moves about</b> by itself, i.e., slaves, <b>and land that does not move about</b> by itself.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> One <b>who sells a city has sold</b> with it <b>the <i>santar</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>santar</i>? Here</b> in Babylonia <b>they interpreted</b> it to mean the land <b>registrar [<i>bar maḥavanita</i>]</b> in charge of keeping track of property boundaries. <b>Shimon ben Avtolemos</b> disagrees and <b>says</b> that it is referring to <b>the fields</b> that surround the city. The Gemara comments: <b>The one who says</b> that <i>santar</i> means the land <b>registrar</b> understands that according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, when one sells a city, <b>all the more so</b> are <b>the fields</b> that surround the city included in the sale. <b>But the one who says</b> that it means <b>the fields</b> that surround the city holds that the land <b>registrar</b> is <b>not sold</b> with the city.
The Gemara attempts to adduce proof in support of one of the opinions: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna here that <b>the olive presses and <i>beit hashelaḥin</i></b> are sold along with the city. The Sages initially <b>maintained: What</b> is meant by <b><i>shelaḥin</i>?</b> This is referring to irrigated <b>fields,</b> fields that require additional irrigation to supplement the rain that they receive. <b>As it is written:</b> “Who gives rain upon the earth <b>and sends [<i>shole’aḥ</i>] water upon the fields”</b> (Job 5:10). <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <i>santar</i> means the land <b>registrar, the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>said</b> that <b>the fields</b> that surround the city <b>are sold</b> with the city, but the land <b>registrar is not sold, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel comes to say</b> that <b>even</b> the land <b>registrar is sold. But according to the one who says</b> that <i>santar</i> means <b>fields, this</b> is what <b>the first <i>tanna</i> is saying as well.</b> In what way, then, does Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel disagree with the first <i>tanna</i>?
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Do you maintain</b> that <b>what</b> is meant by <b><i>shelaḥin</i></b> is irrigated <b>fields?</b> This is <b>not</b> the case. Rather, <b>what</b> is meant by <b><i>shelaḥin</i>?</b> This is referring to <b>gardens</b> found within the city, <b>as it is stated: “Your shoots [<i>shelaḥayikh</i>] are an orchard of pomegranates”</b> (Song of Songs 4:13). <b>But the fields</b> that surround the city <b>are not sold. And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel comes to say</b> that <b>even</b> the <b>fields are sold as well.</b> This is one version of the discussion.
<b>Some say</b> that the discussion took place as follows: The Sages initially <b>assumed</b> that <b>what</b> is meant by <b><i>shelaḥin</i>?</b> This is referring to <b>gardens</b> found within the city. <b>Granted, according to the one who said</b> that <i>santar</i> means <b>the fields</b> that surround the city, <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>said</b> that <b>the gardens</b> found within the city <b>are sold</b> along with the city, but <b>the fields</b> that surround the city <b>are not sold, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel comes to say</b> that <b>even the fields</b> that surround the city <b>are sold.</b>

Daf 68b

<b>But according to the one who says</b> that <i>santar</i> means the land <b>registrar,</b> is it reasonable that <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna <b>said</b> that the <b>gardens</b> within the city are included in the sale of the city, <b>and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel responded to him</b> that the land <b>registrar</b> is included? How are the two connected? The Gemara answers: <b>Do you maintain</b> that <b>what</b> is meant by <b><i>shelaḥin</i></b> is <b>gardens?</b> This is <b>not</b> the case. Rather, <b>what</b> is meant by <b><i>shelaḥin</i>?</b> This is referring to <b>the fields</b> that surround the city, <b>as it is written:</b> “Who gives rain upon the earth <b>and sends [<i>sholeaḥ</i>] waters upon the fields”</b> (Job 5:10). According to the first <i>tanna</i>, it is specifically the fields that are sold with the city, <b>but</b> the land <b>registrar is not sold. And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel comes to say</b> that <b>even</b> the land <b>registrar is also sold.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the following <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: The <i>santar</i> is not sold</b> with the city, but <b>the city scribe [<i>ankolemus</i>] is sold</b> with it. <b>What, is it not</b> clear <b>from</b> the fact <b>that the city scribe is a man</b> that <b>the <i>santar</i> is also a man?</b> The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Are the cases comparable? This</b> case is <b>as it is, and that</b> case is <b>as it is,</b> and <i>santar</i> means fields, and not the land registrar.
The Gemara asks: <b>How can you say</b> that according to Rabbi Yehuda the fields surrounding the city are not sold along with it? <b>But isn’t it taught in the latter clause</b> of this <i>baraita</i>: <b>But</b> when one sells a city he has <b>not</b> sold <b>its remnants, and not its daughters,</b> i.e., the nearby rural villages, <b>and not the woods that are set aside</b> and designated <b>for</b> the city, <b>and not the enclosures [<i>beivarin</i>] for animals, for birds, and for fish. And we said</b> in explanation: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>its remnants? <i>Bizlei</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>bizlei</i>? Rabbi Abba said: The strips of the fields</b> that are separated from the main fields by a stretch that cannot be cultivated. From here, it may be inferred that <b>it is the strips of the fields that are not sold</b> with the city, <b>but the fields themselves are sold</b> with it.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Reverse</b> the statement found in the <i>baraita</i> so that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>the <i>santar</i>,</b> now understood to mean fields, <b>is sold</b> with the city, but the <b>city scribe is not sold</b> with it.
The Gemara asks: <b>How can you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> to the point that you adduce proof from the words of Rabbi Yehuda with regard to the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel? <b>But</b> doesn’t <b>Rabbi Yehuda hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis? As it is taught in the latter clause</b> of that same <i>baraita</i>: <b>But</b> when one sells a city he does <b>not</b> sell <b>its remnants, and</b> he does <b>not</b> sell <b>its daughters,</b> i.e., the nearby rural villages. <b>Whereas</b> with regard to <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, doesn’t he say</b> that one <b>who sold a city sold its daughters</b> along with it, i.e., the nearby rural villages, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>who sells a city has not sold its daughters; Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> One <b>who sells a city has sold its daughters.</b>
The Gemara answers: This does not prove that Rabbi Yehuda disagrees with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as it may be suggested that <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <b>with regard to one</b> issue, that the fields that surround the city are included in the sale, <b>and disagrees with him with regard to</b> another issue, as according to Rabbi Yehuda the nearby villages are not sold along with the city.
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches: When one sells a city he has <b>not</b> sold, among other things, <b>the enclosures for animals, for birds, and for fish. And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> the city <b>has daughters,</b> i.e., nearby villages, they <b>are not sold</b> along <b>with it. If it has one part on the sea and one part on dry land,</b> or if it has <b>enclosures for animals, for birds, or for fish, these are</b> all <b>sold</b> along <b>with</b> the city.
The Gemara answers that this is <b>not difficult,</b> as a distinction can be made between different cases: <b>Here,</b> the one <i>baraita</i> addresses animal enclosures <b>whose openings face inward,</b> i.e., toward the city, and they are therefore considered a part of the city, whereas <b>there,</b> the other <i>baraita</i> addresses animal enclosures <b>whose openings face outward,</b> i.e., away from the city, and therefore they are not included in its sale. The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach: And</b> he has <b>not</b> sold <b>the woods that are set aside for</b> the city, indicating that they face the city, and nevertheless they are not sold along with the city? The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should be emended so that it reads instead: And he has not sold the woods <b>that are set apart</b> from the city, i.e., that are at a distance and do not face the city.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One <b>who sells a field</b> without specifying what is included in the sale <b>has sold the stones</b> in the field <b>that are for its use, and the reeds in the vineyard that are for its use, and the produce that is</b> still <b>attached to the ground, and the cluster of reeds that</b> occupy <b>less than the area required for sowing a quarter-kav of seed [<i>beit rova</i>], and the watch station that is not plastered with clay, and</b> the young <b>carob tree that has not</b> yet <b>been grafted, and the untrimmed sycamore</b> that is still young.
<b>But he has not sold</b> along with the field <b>the stones that are not</b> designated <b>for use</b> in the field, <b>and not the reeds in the vineyard that are not</b> designated <b>for its use, and not the produce that is</b> already <b>detached from the ground. When</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer: I am selling you <b>it and everything that is in it, all these</b> components <b>are sold</b> along with the field. <b>Both</b> in <b>this</b> case, where he executes the sale without specification, <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, where he adds the phrase that he is selling everything that is in the field, <b>he has not sold the cluster of reeds that</b> occupy <b>a <i>beit rova</i></b> or more, as they are considered a separate field, <b>and</b> he has <b>not</b> sold <b>the watch station that is plastered with clay, and not the carob tree that has been grafted, and not the sycamore trunk.</b> All of these entities are significant in their own right and have a status independent from that of the fields, and they are therefore not included in the sale of the field.

Daf 69a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who sells a field has sold the stones in the field that are for its use. The Gemara clarifies: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>stones that are for its use? Here</b> in Babylonia <b>they interpreted</b> it as follows: <b>Stones</b> placed <b>on the sheaves</b> in the field to protect them from being scattered by the wind. <b>Ulla says:</b> The mishna is referring to <b>stones that are arranged for</b> the future building of <b>a fence</b> for the field. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that they are <b>stones that are piled up for</b> the future building of <b>a fence,</b> and not necessarily arranged? The Gemara answers: <b>Teach</b> that Rabbi Ḥiyya said: They are stones that are <b>arranged</b> for the future building of a fence.
The Gemara elaborates on the two explanations: It was stated that <b>here</b> in Babylonia <b>they interpreted</b> the mishna as referring to <b>stones</b> that are placed <b>on the sheaves. According to Rabbi Meir</b> this should be understood as referring to stones <b>that are ready</b> to be used to protect the sheaves, <b>even though they are not</b> yet <b>placed</b> on them. This is in keeping with Rabbi Meir’s opinion that whenever a place is sold, all the accompaniments that are necessary for its proper utilization are included in the sale (see 78b). <b>According to the Rabbis,</b> the mishna is referring specifically to stones <b>that are</b> already <b>placed</b> on the sheaves.
<b>And according to Ulla, who says</b> that the mishna is referring to <b>stones that are arranged for</b> the future building of <b>a fence</b> for the field, <b>according to Rabbi Meir,</b> stones <b>that are ready</b> to be used for building a fence are also included in the sale, <b>even though they are not</b> yet <b>arranged</b> for that purpose. <b>According to the Rabbis,</b> the mishna is referring specifically to stones <b>that are</b> already <b>arranged</b> for building a fence.
The Gemara continues with its clarification of the mishna, which teaches that one who sells a field has <b>also</b> sold <b>the reeds in the vineyard that are for its use.</b> The Gemara asks: With regard to the <b>reeds, what is their purpose</b> in the vineyard? The Sages <b>of the school of Rabbi Yannai said:</b> These are <b>reeds that are split</b> on top and <b>placed under the vines</b> so that the boughs of the vines can rest on them. <b>According to Rabbi Meir,</b> this is referring to reeds <b>that have been smoothed</b> and made ready for this purpose, <b>even though they are not</b> yet <b>set in their place. According to the Rabbis,</b> the mishna refers specifically to reeds <b>that are</b> already <b>set in their place.</b>
The Gemara continues expounding the mishna, which includes among the components that are sold with a field <b>the produce that is</b> still <b>attached to the ground.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Even though</b> the time <b>has</b> already <b>come</b> for the produce <b>to be cut down,</b> it is included in the sale since it is still attached to the ground. The mishna also includes among the things that are sold with a field <b>the cluster of reeds that</b> occupy <b>less than a <i>beit rova</i>.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>Even though</b> these reeds <b>are thick,</b> they are still classified as part of the field.
The mishna teaches that one who sells a field sells with it <b>the watch station that is not plastered with clay.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>Even though it is not fixed in the ground</b> and can still be moved, since it is not plastered, it is not significant enough to be considered an independent entity, and it is considered part of the field. The mishna also includes the following among the components that are sold with a field: <b>And the carob tree that has not been grafted, and the untrimmed sycamore.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>Even though they are</b> big and <b>thick,</b> since they have not yet reached the stage of grafting, in the case of the carob, or trimming, in the case of the sycamore, they are considered part of the field.
The Gemara proceeds to explain the second half of the mishna, which teaches: <b>But he has not sold</b> along with the field <b>the stones that are not</b> designated <b>for use</b> in the field. On the assumption that the mishna speaks of stones that are placed on the sheaves to prevent them from being scattered, <b>according to Rabbi Meir,</b> the mishna is referring to stones <b>that are not ready</b> to be used for this purpose, whereas <b>according to the Rabbis,</b> even if the stones are ready to be used to protect the sheaves, they are not included in the sale if <b>they are not</b> yet <b>placed</b> on them.
<b>And according to Ulla, who says</b> that the mishna is referring to <b>stones that are arranged for</b> the future building of <b>a fence</b> for the field, <b>according to Rabbi Meir,</b> this clause addresses a case <b>where</b> the stones <b>were not ready</b> to be used for this purpose, whereas <b>according to the Rabbis,</b> it addresses a case <b>where</b> the stones <b>were not</b> yet <b>arranged</b> for building a fence, even though they were ready to be used for that purpose.
The mishna teaches that one who sells a field has <b>not</b> sold <b>the reeds in the vineyard that are not</b> designated <b>for its use.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>According to Rabbi Meir,</b> this is referring to a case <b>where</b> the reeds <b>are not smoothed,</b> whereas <b>according to the Rabbis,</b> the reference is to reeds <b>that are not</b> yet <b>set in their place,</b> even if they are smoothed. The mishna further teaches: One who sells a field has also <b>not</b> sold <b>the produce that is detached from the ground.</b> The Gemara comments: The produce is not included in the sale <b>even though it</b> still <b>requires the ground,</b> that is, it needs to be left in the field in order to dry out completely.
The mishna teaches that one who sells a field has <b>not</b> sold <b>the cluster of reeds that</b> occupy <b>a <i>beit rova</i>.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this is so <b>even though they are thin,</b> as since they occupy the area of a <i>beit rova</i> they are considered a separate entity and are not part of the field. Concerning this ruling, <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It is <b>not only a cluster of reeds</b> that is considered a separate entity, and therefore not included in the sale; <b>rather, even a small garden bed of spices</b> that does not occupy the area of a <i>beit rova</i> <b>but has a distinct name is not sold</b> along <b>with</b> the field. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> What <b>this</b> means is <b>that</b> people <b>call it the roses [<i>vardda</i>] of so-and-so,</b> thereby establishing for it a name of its own.
The mishna teaches that the sale does <b>not</b> include <b>the watch station that is plastered with clay.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even though it is attached to the ground,</b> as it is still considered a separate entity and not part of the field. The mishna teaches: He has also <b>not</b> sold <b>the carob tree that has been grafted, and</b> he has <b>not</b> sold <b>the sycamore trunk.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>Even though they are small,</b> they are considered their own entity.
Apropos the discussion of a watch station that is attached to the ground, the Gemara cites a discussion about the sale of a house: <b>Rabbi Elazar raised the dilemma:</b> With regard to wooden <b>door frames, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Are they sold together with the house, or not? The Gemara explains the question: <b>Do not raise the dilemma</b> in a case <b>where</b> the frames <b>are attached</b> to the house <b>with clay, as they are</b> certainly <b>attached</b> to the house and sold along with it. <b>When you can raise this dilemma is where they are connected</b> only <b>with small wooden pegs. What</b> is the ruling in that case? No resolution was found for this question, and so the dilemma <b>shall stand [<i>teiku</i>]</b> unresolved.
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises</b> a similar <b>dilemma</b> about what is included in the sale of a house: With regard to <b>window frames, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Are they sold together with the house, or not? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>they serve merely</b> as <b>an ornament,</b> and are not included in the sale, and the seller can remove them from the house and keep them for himself? <b>Or perhaps, since they are attached</b> to the window, <b>they are attached.</b> The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
And similarly, <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raised a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>stands for the legs of a bed</b> that are placed under the legs to prevent them from being damaged by moisture, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains the question: <b>Do not raise the dilemma wherever</b> the stands <b>move</b> along <b>with</b> the bed, <b>as they move</b> along with it and are therefore not considered part of the house. <b>Where you can raise this dilemma is where they do not move</b> along with the bed. <b>What</b> is the ruling in that case? No resolution was found for this question either, and therefore the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
The mishna teaches: One who sells a field has <b>not</b> sold <b>the carob tree that has been grafted, and</b> he has <b>not</b> sold <b>the sycamore trunk.</b>

Daf 69b

The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> i.e., that a grafted carob and a sycamore trunk are not included in the sale of a field, derived? <b>Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: As the verse states: “So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah,</b> which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave that was within it, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the boundaries around, were established for Abraham as a possession” (Genesis 23:17–18). This teaches that <b>anything that requires a boundary around</b> it, as it does not have natural demarcations, is included in the sale of a field. This <b>excludes these</b> trees, i.e., the grafted carob and the sycamore trunk, <b>which do not require a boundary around</b> them, as they stand out individually on their own. <b>Rav Mesharshiyya says: From here</b> there is a source <b>that</b> the acquisition of the actual <b>boundaries</b> in a sale <b>is from the Torah.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yehuda said: One who sells land to another must write for him</b> the following in the bill of sale: <b>Acquire for yourself the palm trees and the dates and the branches and the seedlings. And even if he did not write this for him</b> the buyer would still <b>acquire</b> all of these entities, as demonstrated by the mishna that it is only a grafted carob and a sycamore trunk that are excluded from the sale of a field. <b>Even so, it is an enhancement of the bill</b> of sale that he write all of the details of the transaction so that there be no possible room for disagreement.
If the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer: I am selling you <b>the land and palm trees, we consider</b> the situation. <b>If he has palm trees, he must give him two palm trees</b> as two is the minimum number of trees that would justify being called: Trees, in the plural. <b>And if he has no</b> palm trees, <b>he must buy two palm trees for him</b> somewhere else. <b>And if</b> he has palm trees, but <b>they are mortgaged</b> to another person, <b>he must redeem two palm trees</b> and give them to the buyer.
If the seller said to the buyer: I am selling you <b>land with palm trees, we consider</b> the situation. <b>If there are palm trees on</b> the land, <b>he must give him</b> the land, <b>and if not,</b> this <b>is a mistaken transaction</b> and the sale is void. If the seller said to the buyer: I am selling you <b>land of palm trees,</b> the buyer <b>has no</b> claim to receive <b>palm trees.</b> Therefore, if the land has no palm trees, this is not a mistaken transaction, as the seller meant to <b>say to him</b> that the land <b>was fit for palm trees,</b> and not that it already contained them. Furthermore, if the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer that he is selling the land <b>except for such and such a palm tree, we consider</b> the situation. <b>If it is a good palm tree,</b> we assume that <b>he retained</b> only <b>that</b> one for himself and did not include it in the sale, but <b>if it is a bad palm tree,</b> we assume that <b>all the more so</b> did he retain for himself <b>the other</b> ones that are of higher quality.
If the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer that he is selling him the entire field <b>except for the trees,</b> we consider the situation. <b>If he has</b> different types of <b>trees</b> in the field, for example, olive and fig trees, he has sold the entire field <b>except for the trees. If he has</b> only <b>palm trees</b> in the field, we assume that he meant to sell the entire field <b>except for the palm trees,</b> even though one does not ordinarily refer to palm trees by the more general term: Trees. Similarly, <b>if he has</b> only <b>grapevines</b> in the field, the buyer acquires everything <b>except for the grapevines.</b>
If the field has both <b>trees and grapevines,</b> he has sold everything <b>except for the trees;</b> therefore, the buyer does not acquire the trees, which the seller excluded from the sale, but he does acquire the grapevines. Similarly, if in the field there are both <b>trees and palm trees,</b> he has sold everything <b>except for the trees.</b> If there are no other trees in the field, but only <b>grapevines and palm trees,</b> everything, including the palm trees, is sold <b>except for the grapevines,</b> which we assume the seller reserved for himself.
<b>Rav says:</b> If the seller specified that he is selling a field but not the trees, <b>any</b> tree that is so tall <b>that one must climb it by rope</b> in order to harvest its fruit <b>is retained</b> and is not included in the sale, and <b>any</b> tree <b>that one need not climb by rope is not retained</b> and is sold along with the field.

Daf 70a

<b>But the judges of the exile,</b> Shmuel and Karna, <b>say: Any</b> tree <b>that is bent</b> back <b>by the yoke</b> of oxen as the animals plow the ground under the tree, and in this way the tree does not impede the plowing, <b>is not retained</b> by the seller, as it is not a significant tree. <b>Any</b> tree <b>that is not bent</b> back <b>by the yoke</b> of the oxen <b>is retained</b> by the seller and not included in the sale. The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> these <i>amora’im</i> <b>do not disagree</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i>: <b>That</b> which Rav said, that the only trees that the seller retains for himself and excludes from the sale are those that must be climbed by means of a rope, was said <b>with regard to palm trees,</b> while <b>that</b> which the judges of the exile said, that the only trees that are retained are those that are not bent back by the yoke of the oxen, was said <b>with regard to</b> other types of <b>trees.</b>
§ The Gemara cites a discussion related to the mishna’s ruling that a grafted carob tree and a sycamore trunk are not included in the sale of the field: <b>Rav Aḥa bar Huna raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> If one selling a field said to the buyer: I am selling you the entire field <b>except for such and such</b> grafted <b>carob tree,</b> or <b>except for such and such</b> sycamore <b>trunk,</b> and there were other grafted carob trees or sycamore trunks in the field, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains the two sides of the question: Does the seller mean to say that <b>it is this carob tree that</b> the buyer <b>does not acquire, but he does acquire the other carob trees, or perhaps</b> he means that <b>he also does not acquire the rest of the carob trees?</b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to him</b> in response: The buyer does <b>not acquire</b> any of them.
Rav Aḥa <b>raised an objection to</b> Rav Sheshet from a <i>baraita</i> that states: If the seller said to the buyer: I am selling you this field <b>except for such and such carob tree,</b> or <b>except for such and such</b> sycamore <b>trunk,</b> the buyer does <b>not acquire</b> it. <b>What, is it not</b> that <b>it is this carob tree that he does not acquire, but he does acquire the other carob trees?</b>
Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: No,</b> what this means is that <b>he does not acquire even the other carob trees. Know</b> that this is correct, <b>as if</b> a person selling a field <b>said to</b> the buyer: <b>My field is sold to you except for such and such field</b> that is adjacent to it, would you say that <b>it is</b> only <b>that</b> adjacent field <b>that he does not acquire, but he acquires</b> all <b>the other</b> fields owned by the seller? This is clearly not the case, as the seller explicitly stated that he is selling a certain field, not all of his fields. <b>Rather,</b> everyone would agree that the buyer does <b>not acquire</b> the other fields. Therefore, <b>here too,</b> the buyer does <b>not acquire</b> the other carob trees.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the discussion took place as follows: <b>Rav Aḥa bar Huna raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet:</b> If one selling a field said to the buyer: I am selling you the entire field <b>except for half of such and such carob tree,</b> or <b>except for half of such and such</b> sycamore <b>trunk, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara explains the two sides of the question: Do we say that the buyer <b>certainly does not acquire the other carob trees, but he does acquire what remains from that carob tree</b> that was mentioned, that is, the half of the carob tree that the seller did not specifically retain for himself? <b>Or perhaps he does not acquire even what remains from that carob tree?</b> Rav Sheshet <b>said to him:</b> Even what remains from that carob tree the buyer does <b>not acquire.</b>
Rav Aḥa <b>raised an objection to</b> Rav Sheshet from a <i>baraita</i> that states: If the seller said to the buyer: I am selling you the entire field <b>except for half of such and such carob tree,</b> or <b>except for half of such and such</b> sycamore <b>trunk,</b> the buyer does <b>not acquire the other carob trees. What, is it not</b> that <b>it is the other carob trees that he does not acquire, but what remains of that carob tree he does acquire?</b>
Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: No,</b> what this means is that <b>he does not acquire even what remains of that carob tree. Know</b> that this is correct, <b>as if</b> a person selling a field <b>said to</b> the buyer: <b>My field is sold to you except for half of such and such field</b> that is adjacent to it, would you say that <b>it is</b> only <b>that</b> half of the field <b>that he does not acquire, but he acquires the other</b> half of the field? This is clearly not the case, as the seller explicitly stated that he is selling a certain field and nothing else. <b>Rather,</b> everyone would agree that the buyer does <b>not acquire</b> the other half of the field. Therefore, <b>here too,</b> the buyer does <b>not acquire</b> what remains of the carob tree.
§ <b>Rav Amram raised a dilemma before Rav Ḥisda:</b> If one <b>deposits</b> certain items <b>with another</b> and receives <b>a document</b> signed by witnesses testifying that he deposited these items with this individual, <b>and</b> the bailee later <b>says to him: I returned</b> the items <b>to you,</b> but the document is still in the hands of the depositor, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say that since if</b> the bailee <b>wanted to</b> lie <b>he</b> could have <b>said</b> that the items <b>were taken</b> from him <b>under circumstances beyond his control,</b> and <b>he would have been deemed credible;</b> therefore <b>now too,</b> when he claims that he returned the items, <b>he is deemed credible as well? Or perhaps,</b> the one who deposited the items can <b>say to him:</b> If you returned the items, <b>what is your document doing in my possession?</b> Upon return of the deposit, you should have retrieved the document. Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him:</b> The bailee <b>is deemed credible.</b>
Rav Amram asked: <b>But let</b> the depositor <b>say to</b> the bailee: If you returned the items, <b>what is your document doing in my possession?</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning, if</b> the bailee had <b>said to him</b> that the items <b>were taken</b> from him <b>under circumstances beyond his control, would he be able to say to him: What is your document doing in my possession?</b> Since this claim could not have been stated had the bailee stated the alternative claim, it can also not be stated when the bailee claims that the items were returned. Rav Amram <b>said to him:</b>

Daf 70b

<b>Ultimately,</b> even <b>when</b> the bailee <b>says to</b> the depositor that the items were <b>taken</b> from him <b>under circumstances beyond his control, is he not required to take an oath?</b> How, then, can you assert that he is deemed credible to claim that he returned the items without taking an oath? Rav Ḥisda said to him: <b>Here too, what</b> did I mean when I said that he is <b>deemed credible?</b> It means that <b>he is deemed credible when</b> he takes <b>an oath.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that Rav Amram and Rav Ḥisda disagree <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between these <i>tanna’im</i>, as</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> with regard to <b>a purse document,</b> i.e., a document that records an arrangement whereby one gives another money as an investment in a joint venture on condition that the profits will be divided equally between the two parties. If the person who received the money died, and this document <b>was presented</b> by the lender <b>against the orphans, the judges of the exile say</b> that the lender <b>takes an oath</b> that the money had never been returned to him, <b>and</b> he <b>collects the entire</b> sum. <b>And the judges of Eretz Yisrael say</b> that he <b>takes an oath and collects</b> only <b>half</b> of the sum.
<b>And</b> it is understood <b>that everyone agrees with</b> the opinion of the Sages <b>of Neharde’a, as</b> the Sages <b>of Neharde’a say:</b> With regard to <b>this joint venture,</b> whereby one person gives money to another on condition that it will be used for business purposes and that the profits will be divided equally between the two parties, <b>half</b> of the invested money is considered <b>a loan,</b> for which the borrower is exclusively liable, <b>and half</b> is considered <b>a deposit,</b> so that if it is lost under circumstances beyond his control, the borrower is exempt from the liability to return it.
According to this assumption, everyone agrees that the claimant can recover from the orphans by means of an oath the half of the money that is considered a loan, just as he would have been able to demand that money from their father. Concerning the half that is considered a deposit, <b>what, is it not with regard to this</b> point that <b>they disagree, as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the judges of the exile, <b>holds</b> like Rav Amram <b>that</b> the depositor <b>can say to</b> the bailee: <b>What is your document doing in my possession?</b> Therefore, neither the father nor his children are deemed credible to claim that they had returned the half that is considered a deposit, and the investor can collect that half as well. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael, <b>holds</b> like Rav Ḥisda, that one <b>cannot assert</b> this claim, and therefore the investor can collect only the half that is considered a loan. But as for the half that is considered a deposit, the father would have been deemed credible in his claim that he had already returned it.
The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>No, everyone,</b> i.e., both the judges of the exile and the judges of Eretz Yisrael, <b>agrees with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥisda,</b> that the father can claim that he returned the money. <b>And here, they disagree about</b> the following issue, <b>as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the judges of the exile, <b>holds</b> that <b>if it is so</b> that he had in fact <b>repaid</b> the money, <b>he would have told</b> his children that he repaid it. Since he did not tell them, it may be assumed that he never repaid the money. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the judges of Eretz Yisrael, <b>holds</b> that you can <b>say</b> that <b>it was the Angel of Death that prevented him</b> from doing so, meaning he died before he had the opportunity to give his children a detailed report concerning his financial affairs.
Apropos this discussion, it is related that <b>Rav Huna bar Avin sent</b> the following ruling: If one <b>deposits</b> an item <b>with another</b> and receives <b>a document</b> attesting to the deposit, <b>and</b> the bailee later <b>says to him: I returned</b> the item <b>to you,</b> the bailee is <b>deemed credible</b> even if the document is still in the hands of the depositor. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>a purse document</b> attesting to a joint venture <b>that was presented</b> by the lender to support his claim <b>against the</b> borrower’s <b>orphans,</b> the lender <b>takes an oath</b> that the money had never been returned to him <b>and collects the entire</b> sum from the orphans.
The Gemara asks: Don’t these <b>two</b> <i>halakhot</i> contradict each other? If the father is deemed credible when he claims that he repaid a loan, the court should present this claim on behalf of his orphans. The Gemara answers: <b>It is different there, as if it is so</b> that the father had, in fact, <b>repaid</b> the money, <b>he would have told</b> his children that he repaid it. Since he did not tell them anything about it, it may be assumed that he never repaid the money.
<b>Rava said:</b> With regard to the case of a purse document that was presented to support a claim against orphans, <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is that the claimant <b>takes an oath</b> that the money had never been returned to him <b>and</b> then <b>collects half</b> of the sum recorded in the document, in accordance with the judges of Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara relates that two generations later, <b>Mar Zutra said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the judges of the exile. Ravina said to Mar Zutra: Didn’t Rava say</b> that the claimant <b>takes an oath and collects half</b> of the sum? Mar Zutra <b>said to him:</b> With regard to the opinion <b>of the judges of the exile, we</b>

Daf 71a

<b>learned the reverse,</b> that is to say, according to our version of the <i>baraita</i>, it is the judges of the exile who maintain that the claimant collects only half the sum, which corresponds to the <i>halakha</i> taught by Rava.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In continuation of the previous mishna (68b) discussing one who sells a field, the mishna teaches that even if he says that he is selling it and everything that is in it, has sold <b>neither the cistern, nor the winepress, nor the dovecote, whether</b> it is <b>abandoned or utilized,</b> as these items are not part of the field itself. <b>And</b> the seller <b>must purchase</b> for himself <b>a path</b> through the buyer’s domain to reach whatever remains his. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva,</b> who holds that one who sells, sells generously; therefore, whatever is not explicitly excluded from the sale is assumed to be sold, and it is presumed that the seller did not retain for himself the right to the path that he requires to access his property. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The seller <b>need not</b> purchase a path through the buyer’s domain, as it is assumed that since the seller withholds these items for himself, he also reserves a path to reach them.
<b>And Rabbi Akiva concedes that when</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer in the bill of sale that he is selling the field <b>apart from these</b> things, i.e., the cistern and the winepress, <b>he need not purchase for himself a path</b> through the buyer’s domain. Since these items would have been excluded from the sale even if he had said nothing, it is assumed that he also meant to reserve for himself the right to access them. But if the seller kept the field but <b>sold</b> the cistern and winepress <b>to another</b> person, <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The buyer <b>need not purchase for himself a path</b> through the seller’s domain to reach what he has bought, since a seller sells generously. <b>But the Rabbis say: He must purchase for himself a path</b> through the seller’s domain.
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that these items are excluded, <b>said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to one who sells</b> a field, <b>but with regard to one who gives</b> it away as <b>a gift,</b> it is assumed that <b>he gives all of it,</b> including everything found in the field. Similarly, with regard to <b>brothers who divide</b> their father’s estate among themselves, when they each <b>acquire</b> a <b>field</b> as part of their inheritance, <b>they acquire all of it,</b> including the items that would be excluded from a sale. So too, with regard to <b>one who takes possession of the property of a convert,</b> when <b>he takes possession of a field, he takes possession of all of it.</b>
<b>One who consecrates a field has consecrated all of it. Rabbi Shimon says: One who consecrates a field has not consecrated</b> any of the items that are ordinarily excluded from a sale <b>except for the grafted carob tree and the sycamore trunk.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is a sale different from</b> a gift, <b>and</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is a gift different from</b> a sale? Why does the mishna distinguish between the two with regard to what is retained by the prior owner? <b>Yehuda ben Nekosa explained before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: The difference between the cases is that <b>this</b> one, the seller, <b>specified</b> that certain items were not included in the sale, <b>and that</b> one, the donor, <b>did not specify.</b>
The Gemara asks: How can it be suggested that <b>this</b> one <b>specified and that</b> one <b>did not specify,</b> when in fact <b>this</b> one <b>did not specify, and that one did not specify,</b> as in neither case did the prior owner specify what items he was reserving for himself? <b>Rather,</b> the difference is that <b>this</b> one, the buyer, <b>should have specified</b> that those items that are not integral parts of the field are nevertheless included in the sale, and since he neglected to do so, he suffers the loss. <b>But</b> in the case of a gift, <b>that</b> one, the recipient, <b>should not have specified</b> what was included in the gift, as it would have been inappropriate for him to act in this manner.
It is related that there was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to</b> others: <b>Give to so-and-so</b> my <b>house containing 100 barrels [<i>gulfei</i>]</b> as a gift. <b>It was found that there was</b> a house in his possession that <b>contained 120</b> barrels. <b>Mar Zutra said:</b> The owner <b>said to him</b> that he was giving him a house containing <b>100</b> barrels, <b>and</b> he <b>did not say to him</b> that he was giving him a house containing <b>120</b> barrels. Therefore, the recipient receives only the portion of the house that holds 100 barrels, and not the rest of the house.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna here: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>with regard to one who sells</b> a field, <b>but with regard to one who gives</b> it away as <b>a gift,</b> it is assumed that <b>he gives all of it. Apparently, one who gives a gift gives generously. Here too,</b> then, say that <b>one who gives a gift gives generously,</b> even if he is not always precise in his wording. Therefore, it should be assumed that the donor intended to give the recipient the entire house, which contains more than 100 barrels.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>One who consecrates a field, has consecrated</b> all of it. <b>Rav Huna said: Even though the Rabbis said:</b> If <b>one buys two trees in</b> the field <b>of another, he does not acquire</b> any of <b>the land</b> but acquires only the trees, and if <b>he sells land</b> to another, <b>and</b> he <b>retains two trees for himself, he</b> also <b>retains the land</b> around those trees, that does not always apply. Rav Huna elaborates: <b>And even according to Rabbi Akiva, who says</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously</b> and does not retain anything for himself, <b>this does not always apply,</b> as <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>with regard to a pit and a cistern, which do not weaken the land,</b> and therefore the seller feels no need to protect himself from the potential claims of the buyer. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>trees, which do weaken the land,</b> as they draw water and nutrients from the soil,

Daf 71b

<b>if it is so that</b> the prior owner <b>did not retain</b> some of the land for himself, <b>let</b> the buyer <b>say to him: Uproot your trees, take</b> them, <b>and go,</b> as the trees draw water and nutrients from the soil, causing damage to the buyer’s land. Therefore, the seller must have retained for himself the land needed for these trees.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>We learned</b> in the mishna here that <b>Rabbi Shimon says: One who consecrates a field has not consecrated</b> any of the items that are ordinarily excluded from a sale <b>except for the grafted carob tree and the sycamore trunk. And it is taught with regard to</b> this in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Shimon said: What is the reason</b> that it is specifically the carob tree and the sycamore trunk that are consecrated? <b>Since</b> they <b>draw</b> their <b>nutrients from a consecrated field,</b> the owner must have had in mind to consecrate them as well, as otherwise his trees would be nurtured from consecrated property.
<b>And if it enters your mind,</b> as Rav Huna claims, that when the seller retains certain trees for himself, he also <b>retains</b> the land around them so that they will be nurtured from soil that belongs to him, what is the reason for Rabbi Shimon’s ruling? <b>When</b> these trees <b>draw</b> their <b>nutrients, they draw</b> their <b>nutrients from</b> the ground that the consecrator had retained for himself that still <b>belongs to him,</b> not from consecrated property.
The Gemara answers: The assumption that Rav Huna’s statement is true according to everyone must be reconsidered. Rather, <b>Rabbi Shimon, who says</b> that one who consecrates his field does not retain for himself the land around the trees, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of his teacher, <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> According to Rabbi Akiva, one who sells, sells generously, and there is no presumption that he retained some item or right for himself unless this was stated explicitly. Therefore, Rabbi Shimon rules that one who consecrates his field has also consecrated the carob trees, as otherwise they would draw nutrients from consecrated land. <b>And Rav Huna, who says</b> that when a seller retains trees for himself he also retains the land around them, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who say that one who sells, sells sparingly.
The Gemara asks: If Rav Huna’s statement is only <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> then isn’t his statement <b>obvious?</b> What novel idea is he adding? The Gemara answers: The practical <b>difference</b> is <b>that</b> while one might have thought that the prior owner retains a right to the land only for the sake of trees that were there, this is not the case. Rather, he retains absolute ownership of the land, and therefore, <b>if</b> the trees <b>fall</b> or die <b>he can plant them again.</b>

Daf 72a

The Gemara asks: <b>But can you establish that</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva,</b> that one who sells or consecrates property does so generously? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one consecrates three trees</b> in a field <b>where ten</b> trees are <b>planted in an area required for sowing one <i>se’a</i> of seed [<i>beit se’a</i>], he has consecrated</b> not only those trees, but also <b>the land and the</b> young <b>trees between them? Therefore,</b> if this is an ancestral field of his, <b>when he redeems</b> them, <b>he redeems</b> the land and everything contained within it according to the standard rate established by the Torah, whereby <b>an area</b> fit <b>for the sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i>,</b> i.e., a <i>kor</i>, of <b>barley seed</b> is redeemed <b>for fifty silver shekels.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If the ratio of land to trees was <b>less than this,</b> and the trees were planted more densely, <b>or</b> if the ratio of land to trees was <b>more than this,</b> and the trees were planted less densely, <b>or if he consecrated</b> each of the trees separately, <b>one after the other, this</b> person <b>has consecrated neither the land nor the</b> young <b>trees between them. Therefore, when he redeems</b> them, <b>he redeems the trees in accordance with their worth. And moreover, even if one consecrates the trees</b> where they are planted more densely, less densely, or one after the other, <b>and then</b> afterward <b>he consecrates the land,</b> so that everything belongs to the Temple treasury, <b>when he redeems</b> them, <b>he redeems the trees</b> separately <b>in accordance with their worth, and then he redeems</b> the land according to the standard rate, where <b>an area</b> fit <b>for the sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i></b> of <b>barley seed</b> is redeemed <b>for fifty silver shekels.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: <b>Whose</b> opinion is expressed in the <i>baraita</i>? <b>If</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, doesn’t he say</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously, and all the more so one who consecrates</b> does so generously? This being the case, even if the trees were consecrated one after the other, some of the land should be consecrated along with them. And <b>if</b> the <i>baraita</i> reflects the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, don’t they say</b> in the mishna that <b>it is</b> specifically <b>the seller who sells sparingly, but one who consecrates, consecrates generously,</b> and therefore the pit and the winepress are consecrated along with the field? Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> stated here is not in accordance with their opinion either. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> in the mishna here, that even one who consecrates a field does not consecrate the cistern and the winepress along with it.
<b>And</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of whom? If</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Akiva, doesn’t he say</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously, and all the more so one who consecrates</b> does so generously? <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that his opinion is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Akiva and say that one who sells, sells sparingly. <b>And Rabbi Shimon</b> disagrees with the Rabbis insofar as <b>he</b> himself <b>holds</b> that <b>just as one who sells, sells sparingly, one who consecrates also consecrates sparingly and retains the land</b> around the trees for himself.

Daf 72b

The Gemara concludes stating the difficulty: <b>But</b> this is <b>difficult,</b> as Rabbi Shimon himself said that the grafted carob tree and the sycamore trunk are consecrated along with the field <b>since they draw</b> their <b>nutrients from a consecrated field,</b> indicating that one who consecrates acts generously and does not retain the land around the trees for himself.
The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> it must be understood that when <b>Rabbi Shimon</b> stated his ruling in the mishna, he was not expressing his own opinion. Rather, <b>he was speaking to the Rabbis in accordance with their statement,</b> and he meant to say: <b>According to my</b> opinion, <b>just as one who sells, sells sparingly, so too, one who consecrates, consecrates sparingly and retains</b> for himself land to nurture the trees. Therefore, when one consecrates a field, even the sycamore and carob tree are not consecrated along with it. But <b>according to your</b> opinion, that one who consecrates does so generously, <b>agree with me at least that</b> one who consecrates a field <b>has consecrated only the grafted carob and the sycamore trunk,</b> because they draw nutrients from consecrated ground, but he has not consecrated the other items that are not integral parts of the field. <b>And the Rabbis said to him: There is no difference</b> between the two in this regard. Since one who consecrates an item does so generously, everything found in the field is consecrated.
The Gemara returns to the <i>baraita</i> that it had concluded was taught according to the opinion of Rabbi Shimon, and asks: <b>In accordance with which opinion did you interpret</b> the <i>baraita</i> discussing consecrated property? It was interpreted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon.</b> But <b>say the last clause: And moreover, even if one consecrates the trees and then</b> afterward <b>he consecrates the land, when he redeems</b> them, <b>he redeems the trees</b> separately <b>in accordance with their worth, and then he redeems</b> the land according to the standard rate, where <b>an area</b> fit <b>for the sowing of a <i>ḥomer</i></b> of <b>barley seed</b> is redeemed <b>for fifty silver shekels.</b>
<b>And if</b> the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, let him follow</b> the character of the field at the time of its <b>redemption, and</b> so the trees should <b>be redeemed along with their land,</b> as at the time of the redemption both the trees and the land are consecrated. <b>As we have</b> already <b>heard that Rabbi Shimon follows</b> the time of the redemption, i.e., he determines the price at which a field is redeemed based on the time it is being redeemed.
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>From where</b> is it derived that <b>with regard to one who purchases a field from his father and consecrates it, and afterward his father dies,</b> so the field would now be considered his as an inheritance, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> with regard to its redemption <b>it should be</b> considered <b>before him as an ancestral field</b> and not a field that he purchased? <b>The verse states</b> about a field that was purchased: <b>“And if</b> he sanctifies to the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral fields”</b> (Leviticus 27:22). The verse speaks specifically of <b>a field that is not fit</b> at the time of its consecration <b>to be an ancestral field,</b> meaning that he never could have inherited it in the future. This specification <b>excludes this</b> field <b>that was fit to be an ancestral field</b> from this <i>halakha</i>, since eventually it would have become his through inheritance, even had he not purchased it. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Meir</b> learns a different <i>halakha</i> from this verse, and he <b>says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> in the case of <b>one who purchases a field from his father, and his father dies, and afterward he consecrates</b> the field, <b>from where</b> is it derived <b>that it should be</b> considered <b>before him like an ancestral field? The verse states: “And if</b> he sanctifies to the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not of his ancestral fields.”</b> The verse refers specifically to <b>a field that is not</b> now <b>an ancestral field</b> at the time of its consecration. This specification <b>excludes this</b> field, <b>as</b> after the death of the father, <b>it is an ancestral field.</b>
<b>But</b> according to <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, a verse is not required</b> to teach that, in a case <b>where his father dies and afterward he consecrates</b> the field, it is considered to be an ancestral field, as this is obvious. <b>A verse is required</b> only to teach the <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where he consecrates</b> the field after having bought it, <b>and afterward his father dies.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where do</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon arrive at this conclusion? <b>If</b> they derive it only <b>from this verse,</b> you can <b>say that</b> the verse <b>came</b> to be interpreted <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> as opposed to the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon, as there is no clear proof from the verse to support either opinion. <b>Rather, is it not due to</b> the fact <b>that they follow</b> the time of the <b>redemption,</b> and at the time of the redemption the father is dead, and the field is the son’s ancestral field that is currently in the possession of the Temple treasury?
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: Actually,</b> I can say to you that <b>generally</b> speaking, <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Shimon do not follow</b> the time of the <b>redemption,</b> and therefore their ruling here is not based on this premise. <b>But here they found a verse and interpreted it,</b> as, if the verse is to be understood as it was explained by Rabbi Meir, then <b>let the verse write: And if</b> he sanctifies to the Lord <b>a field that he has bought, which is not his ancestral estate, or</b> let it write: Which is not <b>his ancestral field. What</b> is meant by the expression: <b>“Which is not of his ancestral fields”</b> (Leviticus 27:22)? It means that <b>a field that is not fit to</b> ever <b>be an ancestral field</b> is considered a purchased field. That <b>excludes this</b> field, <b>as it is fit to be an ancestral field.</b> Based on this explanation, the <i>baraita</i> that addresses one who consecrates trees can, in fact, be understood to be in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shimon.
§ <b>Rav Huna says: A grafted carob and a sycamore trunk have</b> both <b>the status of a tree and the status of land.</b> Each of these <b>has the status of a tree, so if one consecrates or buys two trees and this</b> carob or sycamore, <b>he has</b> also consecrated or bought <b>the land</b> between them, as the sycamore or carob joins with the other two trees to form a unit of three trees that take their land with them. And each <b>has the status of land, as it is not sold along with land,</b> as explained in the mishna, that one who sells a field has not sold a grafted carob or a sycamore trunk that is in the field.
<b>And Rav Huna says</b> in a similar fashion: A large <b>sheaf</b> of grain <b>that contains two <i>se’a</i> has</b> both <b>the status of a sheaf and the status of a heap</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of forgotten sheaves that must be left for the poor. <b>It has the status of a sheaf, as</b> the principle is that <b>two sheaves</b> that were inadvertently <b>left in the field are</b> considered <b>forgotten</b> sheaves that must be left for the poor, whereas three sheaves need not be left for the poor, but rather the owner of the field may go back and take them for himself. In this regard a two-se’a sheaf is considered one sheaf, so if one forgot <b>two</b> sheaves <b>and</b> also <b>this</b> sheave that contains two <i>se’a</i>, the three together are three sheaves and <b>are not</b> considered <b>forgotten</b> sheaves that must be left for the poor.
And <b>it has the status of a heap, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 6:6): In the case of <b>a sheaf that contains two <i>se’a</i>,</b> if <b>one forgets it</b> in a field, it is <b>not</b> considered <b>a forgotten</b> sheaf that must be left for the poor, as its size and importance grant it the status of a heap, rather than a sheaf.
§ <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Reish Lakish says:</b> With regard to whether <b>a grafted carob and a sycamore trunk</b> are consecrated along with a field that one has consecrated, <b>we have arrived at the dispute between Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei and the Rabbis,</b> as Rabbi Menaḥem bar Yosei rules that they are not consecrated, whereas the Rabbis rule that they are.

Daf 73a

The Gemara asks: <b>But let us say</b> that this is <b>the dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis,</b> as it was concluded previously that according to Rabbi Shimon himself, even the carob and sycamore trees are not consecrated. The Gemara answers: Reish Lakish <b>teaches us this, that Rabbi Menaḥem, son of Rabbi Yosei, holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> and therefore Rabbi Shimon is not the only Sage who holds this opinion.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who sells a ship has sold</b> along with it <b>the <i>toren</i>, and the <i>nes</i>, and the <i>ogin</i>, and all</b> of the equipment that is used for <b>directing it. But he has not sold the slaves</b> who serve as oarsmen, <b>nor the packing bags</b> that are used for transporting goods, <b>nor the <i>antikei</i></b> on the ship. <b>And when one said to</b> the buyer: You are purchasing <b>it,</b> the ship, <b>and all that it contains, all of these</b> latter elements <b>are</b> also <b>sold.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The <b><i>toren</i></b> is the <b>mast [<i>iskarya</i>]. And</b> in this regard <b>it states: “They have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts [<i>toren</i>] for you”</b> (Ezekiel 27:5). The <b><i>nes</i></b> is the <b>sail, and</b> in this regard <b>it states: “Of fine linen with richly woven work from Egypt was your sail, that it might be to you for an ensign [<i>nes</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 27:7). With regard to the meaning of <b><i>ogin</i>, Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches: These are</b> the ship’s <b>anchors, and</b> so <b>it states: “Would you tarry for them until they were grown? Would you shut yourselves off for them [<i>te’agena</i>] and have no husbands?”</b> (Ruth 1:13). This demonstrates that the root <i>ayin</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>nun</i>, means being shut up and held firmly in one place.
The mishna teaches that the buyer acquires all the equipment used for <b>directing</b> the ship. <b>Rabbi Abba says: These are the</b> ship’s <b>oars. And</b> this is as <b>it states: “Of the oaks of Bashan they have made your oars”</b> (Ezekiel 27:6). Since a verse discussing ships focuses on its oars, evidently the oars are an integral part of the ship. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it is demonstrated <b>from here: “And all that handle the oar,</b> the mariners, and all the pilots of the sea, <b>shall come down from their ships”</b> (Ezekiel 27:29).
<b>The Sages taught: One who sells a ship has</b> also <b>sold the gangway [<i>iskala</i>]</b> used for boarding the ship, <b>and the water tank it contains. Rabbi Natan says: One who sells a ship has sold the</b> ship’s <b>boat [<i>bitzit</i>],</b> which is used as a lifeboat or for fishing in shallow waters. <b>Sumakhos says: One who sells a ship has sold the <i>dugit</i>,</b> as explained below.
<b>Rava said:</b> The <b><i>bitzit</i> is</b> the same as the <b><i>dugit</i>. Rabbi Natan was a Babylonian,</b> and therefore <b>he called</b> small boats <b><i>butzit</i>, as people say: The <i>botziata</i>,</b> small boats, <b>of Miashan. Sumakhos, who was from Eretz Yisrael, called</b> these boats <b><i>dugit</i>, as it is written:</b> “You shall be taken away with hooks, <b>and your residue in fishing boats [<i>duga</i>]”</b> (Amos 4:2).
§ The Gemara cites several incidents that involve ships and the conversation of seafarers. <b>Rabba said: Seafarers related to me</b> that when <b>this wave that sinks a ship appears with a ray of white fire at its head, we strike it with clubs that are inscribed</b> with the names of God: <b>I am that I am, <i>Yah</i>, the Lord of Hosts, amen amen, Selah. And</b> the wave then <b>abates.</b>
<b>Rabba said: Seafarers related to me</b> that in a certain place <b>between</b> one <b>wave and</b> the next <b>wave</b> there are <b>three hundred parasangs, and the height of a wave is three hundred parasangs. Once,</b> seafarers recounted, <b>we were traveling along the route and a wave lifted us up until we saw the resting place of a small star, and it</b> appeared <b>to me</b> the size of the area needed for <b>scattering forty <i>se’a</i> of mustard seeds. And if it had lifted us higher, we would have been scorched by the heat</b> of the star.
<b>And the wave raised its voice</b> and shouted <b>to another</b> wave: <b>My friend, did you leave anything in the world that you did not wash away, that I may come and destroy it?</b> The second wave <b>said to it: Go out</b> and <b>see the greatness of your Master,</b> God, as even when there is <b>as much as a string of sand</b> on the land <b>I cannot pass, as it is stated: “Will you not fear Me, said the Lord; will you not tremble at My presence? Who has placed the sand for the bound of the sea, an everlasting ordinance, which it cannot pass?”</b> (Jeremiah 5:22).
§ <b>Rabba said: I have seen</b> the one called <b>Hurmin, son of Lilith, when he was running on the pinnacles of the wall of</b> the city of <b>Meḥoza, and a horseman was riding an animal below him but was unable</b> to catch up to <b>him. Once, they saddled for him two mules and they stood</b>

Daf 73b

<b>on the two bridges of</b> the river <b>Rognag, and he jumped from this one to that one, and from that one to this one. And he was holding two cups of wine in his hands and was pouring from this one to that one, and from that one to this one, and not</b> one <b>drop fell to the ground. And that day was</b> stormy, similar to the description in a verse dealing with seafarers: <b>“They mounted up to the heavens, they went down to the deeps;</b> their soul melted away because of trouble” (Psalms 107:26). He continued in this manner <b>until</b> word of his behavior <b>was heard in the house of the king, and they killed him.</b>
<b>Rabba said: I have seen a day-old antelope [<i>urzila</i>] that was</b> as large <b>as Mount Tabor. And how</b> large <b>is Mount Tabor?</b> It is <b>four parasangs. And the length of its neck</b> was <b>three parasangs, and the place where his head rests</b> was <b>a parasang and a half. It cast feces [<i>kufta</i>] and</b> thereby <b>dammed up the Jordan.</b>
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: I have seen a certain frog [<i>akrokta</i>] that was</b> as large <b>as the fort [<i>akra</i>] of Hagronya. And how</b> large <b>is the fort of Hagronya?</b> It is as large as <b>sixty houses. A snake came and swallowed</b> the frog. <b>A raven came and swallowed the snake, and</b> flew <b>up and sat in a tree. Come</b> and <b>see how great is the strength of the tree,</b> which could bear the weight of that raven. <b>Rav Pappa bar Shmuel said: If I had not been there</b> and seen this, <b>I would not believe</b> it.
§ <b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in a ship and we saw a certain fish in</b> whose <b>nostril [<i>be’usyeih</i>] a mud eater [<i>akhla tina</i>],</b> i.e., a type of insect, <b>had sat</b> and killed him. <b>And the waters thrust</b> the fish <b>and threw it upon the shore. And sixty districts were destroyed by</b> the fish, <b>and sixty districts ate from it, and</b> another <b>sixty districts salted its</b> meat to preserve it. <b>And they filled from one of its eyeballs three hundred flasks of oil. And when we returned</b> there <b>after</b> the <b>twelve months</b> of <b>the year</b> had passed, <b>we saw that they were cutting beams from its bones, and they had set out to build those districts</b> that had been destroyed.
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling on a ship and we saw a certain fish upon which sand had settled, and grass grew on it. We assumed</b> that <b>it was dry land and went up and baked and cooked on the back</b> of the fish, <b>but when its back</b> grew <b>hot it turned over. And were it not for</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <b>ship was close</b> by, <b>we would have drowned.</b>
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in a ship and the ship traveled between</b> one <b>fin [<i>shitza</i>] and</b> the other <b>fin of a fish</b> for <b>three days and three nights.</b> The fish was swimming in the opposite direction of the ship, so that <b>it</b> was swimming <b>upward</b> against the wind and the waves, <b>and we were</b> sailing <b>downward. And if you would say</b> that <b>the ship did not travel very fast, when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said:</b> In the short amount of time required to <b>heat a kettle of water,</b> that ship can <b>travel sixty parasangs. And</b> another demonstration of its speed is that <b>a horseman shot an arrow, and</b> yet the ship was traveling so swiftly that it <b>outraced it. And Rav Ashi said: That</b> fish <b>was a sea <i>gildana</i>, which has two</b> sets of <b>fins.</b>
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in a ship and we saw a certain bird that was standing with water up to its ankles [<i>kartzuleih</i>] and its head</b> was <b>in the sky. And we said</b> to ourselves that <b>there is no</b> deep <b>water</b> here, <b>and we wanted to go down to cool ourselves off. And a Divine Voice emerged and said to us: Do not go down here, as the ax of a carpenter fell</b> into it <b>seven years</b> ago <b>and</b> it has still <b>not reached the bottom. And</b> this is <b>not because the water is so large</b> and deep. <b>Rather,</b> it is <b>because the water is turbulent. Rav Ashi said: And that</b> bird <b>is</b> called <b><i>ziz sadai</i>,</b> wild beast, <b>as it is written:</b> “I know all the fowls of the mountains; <b>and the <i>ziz sadai</i> is Mine”</b> (Psalms 50:11).
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in the desert and we saw these geese whose wings were sloping because they were so fat, and streams of oil flowed beneath them. I said to them: Shall we have a portion of you in the World-to-Come? One raised a wing, and one raised a leg,</b> signaling an affirmative response. <b>When I came before Rabbi Elazar, he said to me: The Jewish people will</b> eventually <b>be held accountable for</b> the suffering <b>of</b> the geese. Since the Jews do not repent, the geese are forced to continue to grow fat as they wait to be given to the Jewish people as a reward.
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the items shown by an Arab man to Rabba bar bar Ḥana in the following stories: <b>Like the dust of the sky-blue; the scorpion stung the basket.</b>
<b>And Rabba bar bar Ḥana said: Once we were traveling in the desert and we were accompanied by a certain Arab who would take dust and smell it and say: This is the road to such and such a place, and that is the road to such and such a place. We said to him: How far are we from water? And he said to us: Bring me dust. We brought</b> it <b>to him, and he said: Eight parasangs.</b> Later, we said this <b>a second time, and gave him</b> dust, and <b>he said to us that we are at a distance of three parasangs. I switched</b> the type of dust to test him, <b>but I could not</b> confuse <b>him,</b> as he was an expert in this matter.
That Arab <b>said to me: Come, I will show you the dead of the wilderness,</b> i.e., the Jewish people who left Egypt and died in the wilderness. <b>I went</b> and <b>saw them; and they had the appearance of one who is intoxicated,</b>

Daf 74a

<b>and they were lying on their backs. And the knee of one of them was elevated, and</b> he was so enormous that the <b>Arab entered under his knee while riding a camel and with his spear upright, and he did not touch him. I cut one corner of the sky-blue</b> garment that contains ritual fringes <b>of one of them, and we were unable to walk.</b> The Arab <b>said to me: Perhaps you took something from them? Return it, as we know</b> by tradition <b>that one who takes something from them cannot walk. I then returned</b> the corner of the garment, <b>and then we were able to walk.</b>
<b>When I came before the Sages, they said to me</b> in rebuke: <b>Every Abba</b> is <b>a donkey, and every bar bar Ḥana</b> is <b>an idiot. For</b> the purpose of clarifying <b>what <i>halakha</i> did you do that?</b> If you wanted <b>to know whether</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Shammai or in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Beit Hillel,</b> as to whether there are four or three threads and joints in ritual fringes, in that case there was no need to take anything with you, as <b>you should have</b> simply <b>counted the threads and counted the joints.</b>
Rabba bar bar Ḥana continues his account. That Arab also <b>said to me: Come, I will show you Mount Sinai. I went</b> and <b>saw that scorpions were encircling it, and they were standing</b> as high <b>as white donkeys. I heard a Divine Voice saying: Woe is Me that I took an oath; and now that I took the oath, who will nullify it for me?</b>
<b>When I came before the Sages, they said to me</b> in rebuke: <b>Every Abba</b> is <b>a donkey, and every bar bar Ḥana</b> is <b>an idiot. You should have said: Your</b> oath <b>is nullified.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>And</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana did not nullify the oath because <b>he reasoned: Perhaps</b> God <b>is</b> referring to the <b>oath that</b> He will not <b>flood</b> the earth again. <b>But the Sages</b> would argue that <b>if</b> that were <b>so, why</b> say: <b>Woe is Me?</b> Rather, this must be referring to God’s oath of exile upon the Jewish people.
Rabba bar bar Ḥana continues his account. The Arab also <b>said to me: Come, I will show you those who were swallowed</b> by the earth due to the sin <b>of Korah. I saw two rifts</b> in the ground <b>that were issuing smoke.</b> The Arab <b>took a shearing of wool, and dipped it in water, and inserted it on the head of a spear, and placed it</b> in <b>there. And when he removed</b> the wool, it <b>was scorched. He said to me: Listen</b> to <b>what you hear; and I heard that they were saying: Moses and his Torah are true, and they,</b> i.e., we in the earth, <b>are liars.</b> The Arab further <b>said to me: Every thirty days Gehenna returns them to here, like meat in a pot</b> that is moved around by the boiling water as it cooks. <b>And</b> every time <b>they say this: Moses and his Torah are true, and they,</b> i.e., we in the earth, <b>are liars.</b>
This Arab also <b>said to me: Come, I will show you</b> the place <b>where the earth and the heavens touch each other. I took my basket</b> and <b>placed it in a window of the heavens. After I</b> finished <b>praying, I searched for it but did not find it. I said to him: Are there thieves here? He said to me: This is the heavenly sphere that is turning around; wait here until tomorrow and you will find it.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan relates: Once we were traveling on a ship and we saw a certain fish that took its head out of the sea, and its eyes had the appearance of two moons, and water scattered from its two gills like the two rivers of Sura. Rav Safra relates: Once we were traveling on a ship and we saw a certain fish that took its head out of the sea, and it had horns, and</b> the following was <b>inscribed on them: I am a lowly creature of the sea and I am three hundred parasangs</b> long, <b>and I am going into the mouth of the leviathan. Rav Ashi said: That is the goat of the sea, which searches</b> through the sea <b>and has horns.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan relates: Once we were traveling on a ship and we saw a certain crate [<i>kartalita</i>] in which precious stones and pearls were set, and a species of fish called sharks encircled it.</b> He <b>descended,</b>

Daf 74b

i.e., <b>a diver [<i>bar amoraei</i>]</b> went into the water <b>to bring</b> up this chest, <b>and</b> the fish <b>became angry and sought to sever his thigh, but</b> the diver <b>threw</b> upon it <b>a flask of vinegar and they descended</b> and swam away. <b>A Divine Voice emerged</b> and <b>said to us: What</b> right <b>do you have to</b> touch <b>the crate of the wife of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Dosa, as she is destined to insert sky-blue</b> wool <b>in it to</b> be used in the ritual fringes of <b>the righteous in the World-to-Come?</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda from India relates: Once we were traveling in a ship and we saw a certain precious stone that was encircled by a snake. A diver descended to bring it</b> up, and the <b>snake came and sought to swallow the ship. A raven came</b> and <b>cut off its head,</b> and <b>the water turned into blood</b> due to the enormousness of the snake. <b>Another snake came, took</b> the precious stone, <b>and hung it</b> on the dead snake, <b>and it recovered. It returned</b> and again <b>sought to swallow the ship,</b> and yet again <b>a bird came and cut off its head, took that precious stone,</b> and <b>threw it onto the ship. We had with us these salted birds; we placed</b> the stone <b>on them,</b> and <b>they took</b> the stone <b>and flew away with it.</b>
§ Apropos the stories of large sea creatures, the Gemara discusses the large sea creatures mentioned in the Bible. <b>The Sages taught:</b> There was <b>an incident involving Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Yehoshua, who were traveling on a ship, and Rabbi Eliezer was sleeping and Rabbi Yehoshua was awake. Rabbi Yehoshua trembled, and Rabbi Eliezer awoke.</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: What is this, Yehoshua; for what</b> reason <b>did you tremble?</b> Rabbi Yehoshua <b>said to him: I saw a great light in the sea.</b> Rabbi Eliezer <b>said to him: Perhaps you saw the eyes of the leviathan, as it is written: “And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning”</b> (Job 41:10).
<b>Rav Ashi said: Huna bar Natan said to me: Once we were traveling in the desert, and we had a thigh of meat with us. We cut open</b> the thigh <b>and tore</b> off the sciatic nerve and the forbidden fat <b>and put it on the grass. By</b> the time <b>that we brought wood, the thigh had repaired</b> itself, <b>and we roasted it. When we returned</b> to that place <b>after twelve months</b> of <b>the year</b> had passed, <b>we saw that those coals were still glowing. When I came before Ameimar, he said to me: That grass was a drug of life [<i>samterei</i>],</b> while <b>those coals were of broom.</b>
The verse states: <b>“And God created the great sea monsters”</b> (Genesis 1:21). <b>Here,</b> in Babylonia, <b>they interpreted</b> this as a reference to the <b>sea oryx. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This is leviathan the slant serpent, and leviathan the tortuous serpent, as it is stated: “In that day the Lord with His sore</b> and great and strong <b>sword</b> will punish leviathan the slant serpent, and leviathan the tortuous serpent” (Isaiah 27:1).
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the following statements of Rav Yehuda citing Rav: <b>Everything; time; Jordan. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: Everything that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created in His world, He created male and female. Even leviathan the slant serpent and leviathan the tortuous serpent He created male and female. And if they would have coupled</b> and produced offspring, they would have <b>destroyed the entire world. What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do? He castrated the male and killed the female, and salted</b> the female to preserve it for the banquet <b>for the righteous in the future. As it is stated: “And He will slay the serpent that is in the sea”</b> (Isaiah 27:1).
<b>And He created even the beasts on the thousand hills</b> (see Psalms 50:10) <b>male and female. And</b> they were so enormous that <b>if they would have coupled</b> and produced offspring, <b>they would have destroyed the entire world. What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do? He castrated the male and cooled</b> the sexual desire of <b>the female and preserved it for the righteous in the future. As it is stated</b> about the beasts: <b>“Lo now, his strength is in his loins”</b> (Job 40:16); <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>male.</b> The continuation of the verse: <b>“And his force is in the stays of his body”; this</b> is the <b>female,</b> alluding to the idea that they did not use their genitals for the purpose of procreation.
The Gemara asks: <b>There too,</b> with regard to the leviathan, <b>let Him castrate the male and cool the female;</b> why was it necessary to kill the female? The Gemara answers: <b>Fish are unrestrained,</b> and therefore even if the female was cooled, the female would still procreate. The Gemara suggests: <b>And let Him do the opposite,</b> and kill and preserve the male leviathan. The Gemara responds: <b>If you wish, say</b> that the <b>salted female is better; if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that</b> since <b>it is written: “There is leviathan, whom You have formed to sport with”</b> (Psalms 104:26), the male must be left alive for sport, because it is <b>not proper conduct</b> to sport <b>with a female.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Here too,</b> with regard to the beasts, <b>let Him</b> preserve the <b>female in salt,</b> instead of cooling it. The Gemara answers: <b>Salted fish is good,</b> but <b>salted meat is not good.</b>
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: At the time when the Holy One, Blessed be He, sought to create the world, He said to the minister of the sea: Open your mouth and swallow all the waters of the world,</b> so that there will be room for land. The minister of the sea <b>said before Him: Master of the Universe,</b> it is <b>enough that I will stay within my own</b> waters. God <b>immediately struck him and killed him; as it is stated: “He stirs up the sea with His power, and by His understanding He smites through Rahab”</b> (Job 26:12).
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: Conclude from here</b> that <b>the name of the minister of the sea is Rahab, and were it not for waters</b> of the sea that <b>cover him, no creature could withstand his smell,</b> as his corpse emits a terrible stench. <b>As it is stated: “They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain;</b> for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, <b>as the waters cover the sea”</b> (Isaiah 11:9). <b>Do not read</b> this phrase as <b>“cover the sea”; rather</b> read it as: <b>Cover the minister of the sea,</b> i.e., the term sea is referring to the minister of the sea, not to the sea itself.
<b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: The Jordan issues forth from the cave of Pamyas. That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Jordan issues forth from the cave of Pamyas, and travels in the Sea of Sivkhi,</b> i.e., the Hula Lake, <b>and in the Sea of Tiberias,</b> the Sea of Galilee, <b>and rolls down to the Great Sea, and rolls down until it reaches the mouth of the leviathan. As it is stated: “He is confident, though the Jordan rush forth to his mouth”</b> (Job 40:23). <b>Rava bar Ulla strongly objects to this</b> explanation of the verse, stating: But <b>this</b> verse <b>is written about the beasts on the thousand hills. Rather, Rava bar Ulla said</b> that this is the meaning of the verse: <b>When are the beasts on the thousand hills confident? When the Jordan rushes forth into the mouth of the leviathan.</b>
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the upcoming statements of Rav Dimi: <b>Seas; Gabriel; hungry. When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “For He has founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods”</b> (Psalms 24:2)? <b>These are</b> the <b>seven seas and four rivers that surround Eretz Yisrael. And these are</b> the <b>seven seas: The Sea of Tiberias, the Sea of Sodom,</b> i.e., the Dead Sea, <b>the Sea of Ḥeilat, the Sea of Ḥeilata, the Sea of Sivkhi, the Sea of Aspamya, and the Great Sea,</b> i.e., the Mediterranean. <b>And these are the four rivers: The Jordan, the Jarmuth, and the Keiromyon, and the Piga,</b> which are the rivers of Damascus.
<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he said that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: In the future, Gabriel will perform</b>

Daf 75a

<b>a hunt of the leviathan, as it is stated: “Can you draw out leviathan with a fish hook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?”</b> (Job 40:25). <b>And were the Holy One, Blessed be He, not assisting</b> Gabriel, <b>he would not be able to</b> hunt <b>it, as it is stated: “Only He Who made him can use His sword to approach him”</b> (Job 40:19).
<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: When</b> the <b>leviathan is hungry, he produces breath from his mouth and</b> thereby <b>boils all of the waters in the depths</b> of the sea. <b>As it is stated: “He makes the deep boil like a pot”</b> (Job 41:23). <b>And if</b> the leviathan <b>did not place its head in the Garden of Eden, no creature could withstand his</b> foul <b>smell, as it is stated: “He makes the sea like a seething mixture [<i>merkaḥa</i>]”</b> (Job 41:23), and the term <i>merkaḥa</i> is also used to describe something with a smell (see Exodus 30:25).
<b>And when he is thirsty, he makes many furrows in the sea, as it is stated: “He makes a path to shine after him”</b> (Job 41:24). <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov says:</b> After the leviathan drinks from the sea, <b>the depth</b> of the sea does <b>not return to its normal condition until seventy years</b> have passed, <b>as it is stated: “One would think the deep to be hoary”</b> (Job 41:24), <b>and hoary</b> indicates a person who is <b>no less than seventy</b> years old.
<b>Rabba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will make a feast for the righteous from the flesh of the leviathan, as it is stated: “The <i>ḥabbarim</i> will make a feast [<i>yikhru</i>] of him”</b> (Job 40:30). <b>And <i>kera</i></b> means <b>nothing other than a feast, as it is stated: “And he prepared [<i>va’yikhreh</i>] for them a great feast [<i>kera</i>]; and they ate and drank”</b> (II Kings 6:23). <b>And <i>ḥabbarim</i></b> means <b>nothing other than Torah scholars, as it is stated: “You that dwell in the gardens, the companions [<i>ḥaverim</i>] hearken for your voice: Cause me to hear it”</b> (Song of Songs 8:13). This verse is interpreted as referring to Torah scholars, who listen to God’s voice.
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>the remainder</b> of the leviathan, they will <b>divide it and use it for commerce in the markets of Jerusalem, as it is stated: “They will part him among the <i>kena’anim</i>”</b> (Job 40:30). <b>And <i>kena’anim</i></b> means <b>nothing other than merchants, as it is stated: “As for the merchant [<i>kena’an</i>], the balances of deceit are in his hand. He loves to oppress”</b> (Hosea 12:8). <b>And if you wish, say</b> that the proof is <b>from here: “Whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers [<i>kinaneha</i>] are the honorable of the earth”</b> (Isaiah 23:8).
<b>And Rabba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will prepare a <i>sukka</i> for the righteous from the skin of</b> the <b>leviathan, as it is stated: “Can you fill his skin with barbed irons [<i>besukkot</i>]”</b> (Job 40:31). If one <b>is deserving</b> of being called righteous, an entire <b><i>sukka</i> is prepared for him</b> from the skin of the leviathan; if one is <b>not deserving</b> of this honor, <b>a covering is prepared for his</b> head, <b>as it is stated: “Or his head with fish-spears”</b> (Job 40:31).
If one is <b>deserving</b> at least of this reward, <b>a covering is prepared for him,</b> and if one is <b>not deserving, a necklace is prepared for him, as it is stated: “And necklaces about your neck”</b> (Proverbs 1:9). If one is somewhat <b>deserving, a necklace is prepared for him,</b> and if one is <b>not deserving</b> even of this, only <b>an amu-let is prepared for him</b> from the skin of the leviathan, <b>as it is stated: “Or will you bind him for your maidens”</b> (Job 40:29), i.e., a small amulet is prepared for him, like the amulets tied on children’s necks.
<b>And</b> with regard to <b>the remaining</b> part of the skin of the leviathan, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, spreads it on the walls of Jerusalem, and its glory radiates from</b> one <b>end of the world until the</b> other <b>end. As it is stated: “And nations shall walk in your light, and kings at the brightness of your rising”</b> (Isaiah 60:3).
§ With regard to the future glory of Jerusalem, the Gemara interprets the verse: <b>“And I will make your pinnacles of <i>kadkhod</i>”</b> (Isaiah 54:12). <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: Two angels in heaven, Gabriel and Michael, disagree</b> with regard to the material that will be used to form the walls of Jerusalem. <b>And some say</b> that this dispute is between <b>two <i>amora’im</i> in the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael. <b>And who are they?</b> They are <b>Yehuda and Ḥizkiyya, the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya. One said</b> they will be made of <b>onyx, and one said</b> of <b>jasper. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: Let it be like this [<i>kedein</i>] and like that [<i>ukhedein</i>],</b> i.e., let them be formed from both together. This compromise is indicated by the word <i>kadkhod</i>, a combination of this [<i>kedein</i>] and that [<i>ukhedein</i>].
The Gemara analyzes the rest of that verse: <b>“And your gates of precious stones”</b> (Isaiah 54:12). This should be understood <b>in</b> light of <b>that</b> incident <b>where Rabbi Yoḥanan sat and taught:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will bring precious stones and pearls that are thirty by thirty</b> cubits, <b>and He will hollow out in them</b> a hole of <b>ten by twenty</b> cubits <b>and set them in the gates of Jerusalem. A certain</b> unnamed <b>student sneered at him,</b> saying: <b>Now we do not find</b> precious stones even <b>of</b> the size of <b>an egg of a dove,</b> and yet <b>all of this we will find?</b>
<b>After</b> a period of <b>time</b> that student’s <b>ship went to sea,</b> where <b>he saw ministering angels sitting and sawing precious stones and pearls that were thirty by thirty</b> cubits, <b>and hollowed out in them</b> were holes of <b>ten by twenty</b> cubits. <b>He said to</b> the angels: <b>For whom are these? They said to him that</b> in the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will place them in the gates of Jerusalem.</b> Later, the student <b>came before Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and <b>said to him:</b> Continue to <b>interpret, my teacher, it is fitting for you to interpret,</b> as <b>I saw</b> just <b>as you said.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him: Worthless</b> man, <b>if you had not seen, you would not have believed;</b> clearly, <b>you are mocking the statement of the Sages.</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>set his eyes upon him, and</b> the student was instantly killed <b>and turned into a pile of bones.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> against Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, based on a <i>baraita</i>. The verse states: <b>“And I will make you go upright [<i>komemiyyut</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 26:13). <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> In the future, the Jewish people will have the stature of <b>two hundred cubits, equivalent to two</b> times the <b>height [<i>komot</i>] of Adam the first</b> man, whose height was one hundred cubits. Rabbi Meir interprets the word <i>komemiyyut</i> as two <i>komot</i>.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> They will have the stature of <b>one hundred cubits, corresponding to the Sanctuary and its walls, as it is stated: “We whose sons are as plants grown up in their youth; whose daughters are as corner-pillars carved after the fashion of the Sanctuary”</b> (Psalms 144:12). But if they are each one hundred cubits tall, how could the Jews enter the gates of Jerusalem, whose entrance gate will be ten by twenty cubits, as claimed by Rabbi Yoḥanan? The Gemara answers: <b>When Rabbi Yoḥanan stated</b> that idea, he was not referring to the gates themselves but <b>to</b> the <b>windows that</b> allow <b>wind</b> to enter.
§ <b>And Rabba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will fashion seven canopies for each and every righteous</b> individual, <b>as it is stated: “And the Lord will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over those who are invited to it, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory shall be a canopy”</b> (Isaiah 4:5). This <b>teaches that</b> for <b>each and every</b> righteous individual, <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, fashions for him a canopy</b> seven times over, <b>in accordance with his honor,</b> i.e., greater individuals receive grander and larger canopies.
The Gemara asks a question with regard to the above verse: <b>Why</b> should there be <b>smoke in a canopy? Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> It is <b>because anyone whose eyes are narrow,</b> i.e., is stingy, <b>toward Torah scholars in this world, his eyes fill with smoke in the World-to-Come. And why</b> should there be <b>fire in a canopy? Rabbi Ḥanina said:</b> This <b>teaches that each and every one is burned from</b> embarrassment at the size of <b>the canopy of the other,</b> and says: <b>Woe for this embarrassment, woe for this disgrace,</b> that I did not merit a canopy as large as his.
<b>In a similar manner, you</b> can <b>say</b> that God said to Moses about Joshua: <b>“And you shall put of your honor upon him”</b> (Numbers 27:20), which indicates that you should put some of your honor, <b>but not all of your honor. The elders of that generation said: The face of Moses</b> was as bright <b>as the face of the sun; the face of Joshua</b> was <b>like the face of the moon. Woe for this embarrassment, woe for this disgrace,</b> that we did not merit another leader of the stature of Moses.
<b>Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, fashioned ten canopies for Adam the first</b> man, <b>in the Garden of Eden; as it is stated</b> to Hiram, king of Tyre: <b>“You were in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone</b> was your covering, the carnelian, the topaz, and the emerald, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the carbuncle, and the smaragd, and gold; the workmanship of your drums and of your holes was in you; they were prepared on the day that you were created” (Ezekiel 28:13). This verse mentions ten items, from carnelian to gold. <b>Mar Zutra said:</b> There were <b>eleven</b> canopies, <b>as it states: “Every precious stone,”</b> which is also part of the tally. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: And the worst of all of them</b> was <b>gold, as it is counted last,</b> which indicates that the other items are more valuable.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“The workmanship of your drums and of your holes [<i>nekavekha</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 28:13)? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Hiram, king of Tyre:</b> Were you in the Garden of Eden when I created all of this for you? <b>I looked at you,</b> saw that you would one day claim divinity for yourself, <b>and created many orifices [<i>nekavim</i>] in man,</b> i.e., the excretory system, so that you would know that you are human and not a god. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>this</b> is what God <b>said</b> to Hiram: <b>I looked at you</b>

Daf 75b

<b>and I decreed death on Adam the first</b> man, to demonstrate that he was human and not a god.
§ The Gemara returns to the aforementioned verse: “And the Lord will create over the whole habitation of Mount Zion, and over those who are invited to it, a cloud and smoke by day” (Isaiah 4:5). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“And over those who are invited to it”? Rabba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Jerusalem of the World-to-Come is not like Jerusalem of this world.</b> With regard to <b>Jerusalem of this world, anyone who wants to ascend</b> there can <b>ascend.</b> With regard to Jerusalem <b>of the World-to-Come, only those who are invited to it</b> can <b>ascend.</b>
<b>And Rabba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the <b>future, the righteous will be called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He; as it is stated: “Every one that is called by My name, and whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him”</b> (Isaiah 43:7). This indicates that one who was created by God and causes Him glory is called by His name. <b>And Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Three were called by the name of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and they are: The righteous, and the Messiah, and Jerusalem.</b>
With regard to <b>the righteous, this</b> is <b>as we</b> have just <b>said.</b> With regard to <b>the Messiah,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “And this is his name whereby he shall be called, the Lord is our righteousness”</b> (Jeremiah 23:6). With regard to <b>Jerusalem,</b> this is <b>as it is writ-ten: “It shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about. And the name of the city from that day shall be, the Lord is there [<i>shamma</i>]”</b> (Ezekiel 48:35). <b>Do not read</b> the word as <b>“there” [<i>shamma</i>]; rather,</b> read it as: The Lord is <b>its name [<i>shemah</i>]. Rabbi Elazar says:</b> In the <b>future, the righteous will</b> have the name: <b>Holy, recited before them, as one recites before the Holy One, Blessed be He; as it is stated: “And it shall come to pass, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy”</b> (Isaiah 4:3).
<b>And Rabba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will raise Jerusalem three parasangs upward; as it is stated: “And it shall be lifted up and inhabited in its place”</b> (Zechariah 14:10). <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase <b>“in its place”?</b> It means <b>equivalent to its place,</b> i.e., Jerusalem will be raised to a height whose measure in parasangs corresponds to the measure of its area in square parasangs. The Gemara asks: <b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that the place</b> of Jerusalem <b>was</b> an area of <b>three</b> square <b>parasangs? Rabba said</b> that <b>a certain elder said to me: I saw the initial Jerusalem,</b> when it was still extant, <b>and</b> its area <b>was three</b> square <b>parasangs.</b>
The Gemara continues to discuss the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>And lest you say</b> that <b>there is discomfort in ascending</b> to a place so high, <b>the verse states</b> in a prophecy depicting the return of the Jewish people to Jerusalem: <b>“Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their cotes”</b> (Isaiah 60:8). This indicates that they can easily ascend to Jerusalem, as though they were clouds or doves. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> Incidentally, one can <b>learn from</b> that statement that <b>this cloud</b> mentioned in the verse <b>is three parasangs high,</b> as it reaches Jerusalem, which will be raised three parasangs.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, wished to give</b> a set <b>measure for Jerusalem, as it is stated</b> in a prophecy of Zechariah: “And I lifted up my eyes and saw, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand. <b>Then I said: Where are you going? And he said to me: To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth, and what is its length”</b> (Zechariah 2:5–6).
<b>The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, You have created many cities in Your world for the nations of the world, and You did not give the measure of their length or the measure of their width,</b> i.e., they are not limited by any set measure, but expand as they develop. With regard to <b>Jerusalem, which has Your name in it, and Your Temple in it, and righteous people in it,</b> will <b>You give it a measure? Immediately:</b> “And, behold, the angel that spoke with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him, <b>and said to him: Run, speak to this young man, saying: Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls for the multitude of men and cattle within it”</b> (Zechariah 2:7–8).
<b>Reish Lakish says:</b> In the <b>future, the Holy One, Blessed be He, will add to Jerusalem one thousand</b> times the numerical value of <b><i>tefaf</i></b> of <b>gardens; one thousand</b> times the numerical value of <b><i>kefel</i></b> of <b>towers; one thousand</b> times the value of <b><i>litzoy</i></b> of <b>fortifications;</b> and <b>one thousand and two</b> times the value of <b><i>shilo</i></b> of <b>small houses [<i>totpera’ot</i>]. And each and every one</b> of these additions <b>will be like</b> the great city of <b>Tzippori in its prosperity.</b>
The Gemara clarifies the size of the city of Tzippori. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: I saw Tzippori in its prosperity, and there were one hundred and eighty thousand markets of sellers of</b> meat <b>sauces in it.</b> On this basis, one can estimate the future size of Jerusalem.
In a similar manner, the Gemara interprets the verse: <b>“And the side-chambers were one over another, three and thirty times”</b> (Ezekiel 41:6). <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>“Three and thirty times”? Rabbi Levi says</b> that <b>Rav Pappi says in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua of Sikhnei: If</b> in the future <b>Jerusalem</b> will triple in size, so that it occupies <b>three</b> times its former area, then <b>each and every</b> dwelling will <b>contain thirty stories upward. If</b> the area of <b>Jerusalem</b> will be multiplied by <b>thirty, each and every</b> dwelling will <b>contain three stories above</b> every house.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the mishna, which discusses the acquisition of a ship. <b>It was stated</b> that there was a dispute among <i>amora’im</i> with regard to the manner in which <b>a ship</b> is acquired. <b>Rav says: Once</b> the buyer <b>has pulled</b> the ship and moved it by <b>any amount,</b> he has <b>acquired</b> it. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> He does <b>not acquire</b> it <b>until he pulls the entire</b> ship to the extent that the end of the ship has at least reached the place previously occupied by its front.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this dispute <b>is parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>How</b> is an animal acquired <b>through passing?</b> If the buyer <b>grasped it by its hoof,</b> or <b>by its hair,</b> or <b>by the saddle that is on it,</b> or <b>by the load that is on it,</b> or <b>by the bit [<i>perumbiyya</i>] in its mouth,</b> or <b>by the bell on its neck,</b> he has <b>acquired it. How</b> is an animal acquired <b>through pulling?</b> If <b>he calls it and it comes, or</b> if <b>he hits it with a stick and it runs before him, once it lifts a foreleg and a hind leg</b> from where it was standing, he has <b>acquired it. Rabbi Aḥai, and some say Rabbi Aḥa, says:</b> It is not enough if the animal lifts its hooves. Rather, one does not acquire it <b>until it walks its full length,</b> i.e., it moves both of its forelegs and both of its hindlegs.
<b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Rav, who</b> holds that a buyer can acquire the ship even by moving it only a minimal distance, <b>states</b> his ruling <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> that it is enough for the animal to lift two legs; <b>and Shmuel, who</b> holds that the entire ship must be moved, <b>states</b> his ruling <b>in accordance</b> with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Aḥa</b> that the animal must move its full length? The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: I state</b> my ruling <b>even</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Aḥa,</b> since <b>Rabbi Aḥa states</b> his opinion <b>only with regard to animals, as although it lifted a foreleg and a hind leg, it stands in its place. But</b> in the case of <b>a ship, once a bit of it moves, all of it moves,</b> and therefore the buyer acquires it.
<b>And Shmuel</b> could <b>say: I stated</b> my ruling <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>. The first <i>tanna</i> states</b> his opinion <b>only with regard to animals, as once</b> an animal has <b>lifted a foreleg and a hind leg, the other</b> legs <b>stand</b> ready <b>to be lifted. But</b> with regard to <b>a ship, if he pulls the entire</b> ship, <b>yes,</b> he acquires it, but <b>if</b> he does <b>not</b> pull the whole ship, he does <b>not</b> acquire it.
The Gemara offers another suggestion: <b>Let us say</b> that the dispute of Rav and Shmuel is <b>parallel to</b> the dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A ship is acquired by pulling. Rabbi Natan says: A ship and letters,</b> i.e., the content of a promissory note, <b>are acquired by pulling</b> the document

Daf 76a

<b>and by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of sale.
The Gemara clarifies the <i>baraita</i>: <b>Letters</b> in promissory notes, <b>who mentioned</b> anything about <b>them?</b> Why would Rabbi Natan speak about promissory notes, which are not discussed by the first <i>tanna</i>? The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete, and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: A ship is acquired by pulling, and letters,</b> i.e., the content of a promissory note, <b>are acquired by</b> merely <b>transferring</b> the document, not through pulling. <b>Rabbi Natan says: A ship and letters are acquired by pulling and</b> also <b>by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of sale.
The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>a bill</b> of sale <b>for a ship?</b> A ship <b>is movable property,</b> which is acquired not by means of giving a bill of sale, but through other acts of acquisition. <b>Rather, is it not</b> correct to say that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is teaching: A ship is acquired by pulling, and letters</b> of credit <b>by passing. Rabbi Natan says: A ship</b> is acquired <b>by pulling, and letters,</b> i.e. the contents of a promissory note, are acquired either through pulling or <b>by</b> means of <b>a bill</b> of sale.
The Gemara asks: If Rabbi Natan holds that <b>a ship</b> is acquired <b>by pulling,</b> his opinion <b>is</b> apparently identical to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>. Rather,</b> the practical difference <b>between</b> the two opinions is the dispute <b>of Rav and Shmuel.</b> According to the opinion of one <i>tanna</i> the buyer must move the entire ship out of its current location, while the other <i>tanna</i> maintains that one must move the ship only a minimal amount. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No, everyone,</b> Rabbi Natan and the first <i>tanna</i>, holds <b>either in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav, or in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Shmuel. And with regard to a ship, everyone agrees</b> that it is acquired through pulling.
<b>When they disagree,</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> acquiring <b>letters,</b> i.e. the contents of a promissory note. <b>And this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Natan is saying to the first <i>tanna</i>: With regard to a ship, I certainly concede to you</b> that it is acquired by pulling. But <b>with regard to letters,</b> whereas you maintain that passing suffices to acquire them, I hold that <b>if</b> in addition <b>there is a bill</b> of sale, <b>yes,</b> the acquisition is valid, but <b>if not,</b> the act of passing is <b>not</b> effective.
<b>And</b> according to this interpretation, the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Natan disagree <b>with regard to the dispute</b> between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Letters,</b> i.e., the contents of a promissory note, <b>are acquired by</b> merely <b>transferring</b> the document; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say: Whether one wrote</b> a bill of sale <b>but did not transfer</b> the promissory note to the buyer, or <b>whether he transferred</b> the promissory note <b>but did not write</b> a bill of sale, the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> the documents <b>until</b> the seller both <b>writes</b> a bill of sale <b>and transfers</b> the promissory note.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with which</b> opinion <b>did you interpret</b> the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> of the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>? If it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, then <b>let a ship be acquired also by passing,</b> not only through pulling, as stated in the following <i>baraita</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A ship is acquired by passing;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The buyer <b>does not acquire</b> it

Daf 76b

<b>until he pulls it, or until he rents its place.</b> How, then, can the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> be ascribed to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi?
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult; here,</b> where Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi states that a ship is acquired through passing, he is referring to a ship situated <b>in the public domain.</b> Since a ship in the public domain cannot be acquired through pulling, which must be performed in a domain that is in one’s possession, it is acquired through passing. By contrast, <b>there,</b> in the first <i>baraita</i>, the ship is situated <b>in an alleyway [<i>simta</i>],</b> which is not the public domain, as both parties have the right to keep their possessions there. A ship in this location must be acquired through pulling.
The Gemara asks: <b>To what</b> case <b>did you interpret that last</b> <i>baraita</i> to be referring? It was interpreted as referring <b>to the public domain.</b> If so, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> it <b>until he pulls it</b> or until he rents its place. The Gemara asks: <b>But if</b> the ship is situated <b>in the public domain, from whom can he rent</b> the place? <b>And furthermore, does pulling in the public domain effect acquisition? But don’t Abaye and Rava both say</b> with regard to the different methods of acquisition: <b>Passing effects acquisition in the public domain or in a courtyard that does not belong to either of</b> the parties; <b>pulling effects acquisition in an alleyway or in a courtyard that belongs to both of</b> the parties; <b>and lifting effects acquisition in every place,</b> even in the seller’s domain.
The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean <b>when it says: Until he pulls it, and what</b> does it mean <b>when it says: Until he rents its place? This</b> is what it <b>is saying:</b> The buyer does not acquire the ship <b>until he pulls it from the public domain into an alleyway. And if</b> the ship <b>is</b> located in <b>the domain</b> of some other <b>owner,</b> the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> it <b>until he rents its place</b> from the owner.
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>Abaye and Rava state</b> their opinion <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, not that of the Rabbis? The <i>baraita</i> indicates that only Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi maintains that one can acquire ownership by means of passing in the public domain.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> The Rabbis agree that it is possible to effect acquisition in the public domain through the act of passing. Therefore, <b>if</b> it is a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>says to him: Go take possession and</b> thereby <b>effect acquisition, so too</b> he can effect acquisition through the act of passing, and does not need to pull it. <b>Here</b> the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, as <b>we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>says to him: Go pull and</b> thereby <b>effect acquisition</b> of it.
Rav Ashi elaborates: One <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that the seller is <b>particular</b> about the method by which the item is acquired, and therefore it can be acquired only through pulling. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that the seller is merely <b>indicating the manner to him,</b> i.e., he advises him to use this act of acquisition but he does not mind if the buyer prefers to perform a different act of acquisition.
§ The Gemara returns to the issues of acquiring promissory notes. <b>Rav Pappa says: One who sells</b> a promissory <b>note to another must write to him: Acquire it and all liens on property that are</b> contained <b>within it. Rav Ashi said: I stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> before Rav Kahana, and I said to him</b> the following analysis: <b>The reason</b> the buyer acquires it is <b>that</b> the seller <b>wrote this for him.</b> This indicates that if <b>he did not write this for him,</b> the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> the monetary rights recorded in the promissory note.
Rav Ashi asks: Why, then, did he purchase the promissory note? <b>But does he require</b> it <b>to tie around the mouth of his flask</b> as a stopper? Clearly, he purchased the document for the purpose of collecting the debt recorded in it. Rav Pappa <b>said to me: Yes,</b> it is possible that he purchased the promissory note in order <b>to tie</b> it around his flask. Since the owner did not transfer ownership of the obligation recorded in the promissory note, the buyer acquires only the paper itself.

Daf 77a

<b>Ameimar says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>letters are acquired by</b> merely <b>transferring</b> the document to the buyer, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar:</b> Is your ruling based on <b>a tradition or</b> on your own <b>logical reasoning?</b> Ameimar <b>said to him:</b> It is based on <b>a tradition. Rav Ashi said: It also</b> stands to <b>reason</b> that the contents of a promissory note are acquired through transferring, <b>as letters,</b> i.e., the contents of a promissory note, <b>are words,</b> i.e., the buyer is acquiring the right to a monetary obligation, not a physical item, <b>and words cannot be acquired through</b> other <b>words.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it true that documents <b>cannot</b> be acquired through words? <b>But doesn’t Rabba bar Yitzḥak say</b> that <b>Rav says: There are two</b> types of <b>documents.</b> The first type is where one says to others: <b>Take possession of this field for so-and-so and write the document for him</b> as proof of the sale of the field. In this case, <b>he may renege with regard to the document,</b> i.e., he may change his mind and tell them not to write it. <b>But he may not renege with regard to the field,</b> as the buyer has already acquired it.
The second type of document is where he said: Take possession of this field for so-and-so <b>on the condition that you write him a document.</b> If the document has not yet been delivered <b>he can retract</b> his instruction <b>both with regard to the document and with regard to the field,</b> as the transfer of the field is dependent on the writing of the document.
<b>And Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin</b> says that <b>Rav Huna says: There are</b> actually <b>three</b> types of <b>documents. Two</b> are <b>those that we stated</b> above, and <b>the other</b> is <b>if</b> the <b>seller wrote the document in advance.</b>

Daf 77b

This is <b>like that which we learned</b> in a mishna (167b): A scribe <b>may write a bill</b> of sale <b>for the seller even if the buyer is not with him</b> when the seller presents his request. In a case of this kind, <b>once this</b> buyer <b>takes possession of the land the deed is acquired wherever it is. And this is that which we learned</b> in another mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 26a): <b>Property that does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, can be <b>acquired</b> together <b>with property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land, when the land is acquired <b>by</b> means of giving <b>money, or</b> by means of giving <b>a document, or</b> by means of taking <b>possession.</b> This shows that a bill of sale can be transferred without any act of acquisition performed for the document, and certainly through words, which presents a difficulty to Rav Ashi’s opinion.
The Gemara answers: Acquiring a bill of sale <b>by means of</b> acquisition of land <b>is different,</b> as it is similar to acquisition through an item, not by means of words. The reason is <b>that money, which cannot be acquired through</b> symbolic <b>exchange,</b> a pro forma act of acquisition effecting the transfer of ownership of an item, nevertheless <b>can be acquired by means of land.</b>
This is <b>like that</b> incident <b>where Rav Pappa had</b> deposited <b>twelve thousand dinars</b> with bailees <b>in Bei Ḥozai. He transferred</b> ownership of the money in Bei Ḥozai <b>to</b> his agent <b>Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa by means of the threshold of his house.</b> The Gemara adds: <b>When</b> Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa <b>came</b> from Bei Ḥozai with the money, Rav Pappa was so happy that he was bringing him his money that he <b>went out</b> all the way <b>until Tavakh to</b> greet <b>him.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that when one sells a ship he has sold various other items; <b>but he has not sold the slaves, nor the packing bags, nor the <i>antikei</i>.</b> But when one said to the buyer: You are purchasing the ship and all that it contains, all of these are sold as well. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>antikei</i>? Rav Pappa said:</b> It means <b>the merchandise that is on</b> the ship. This merchandise is not sold together with the ship.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> One who <b>sold a wagon [<i>hakkaron</i>] has not sold the mules</b> that pull the wagon. Similarly, if one <b>sold the mules, he has not sold the wagon.</b> One who <b>sold a yoke [<i>hatzemed</i>] has not sold the oxen,</b> and one who <b>sold the oxen has not sold the yoke. Rabbi Yehuda says: The</b> sum of <b>money indicates</b> what one has sold. <b>How so?</b> If the buyer <b>said to</b> the seller: <b>Sell me your yoke for two hundred dinars,</b> since <b>it is a known matter that a yoke is not</b> sold <b>for two hundred dinars</b> he clearly intended to purchase the oxen as well. <b>And the Rabbis say: The</b> sum of <b>money is not proof.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Taḥlifa, from the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Abbahu.</b> If one <b>sold a wagon, he has sold the mules</b> together with it. Rabbi Abbahu asked: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>he has not sold</b> the mules? Rav Taḥlifa <b>said to him:</b> Should <b>I erase</b> this <i>baraita</i>, as it is incorrect? Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: No,</b> do not erase it; you should <b>explain</b> that <b>your <i>baraita</i></b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the mules <b>are fastened to</b> the wagon. In that situation, one who purchases the wagon receives the mules as well.
The mishna teaches: One who <b>sold a yoke has not sold the oxen;</b> and the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda disagree over whether the sum of money proves exactly what was sold. The Gemara analyzes their disagreement: <b>What are the circumstances? If we say</b> that the mishna is referring to a place <b>where they call a yoke: <i>Tzimda</i>, and</b> they call <b>oxen: <i>Bakar</i>,</b> it is <b>obvious</b> that <b>he sold him a yoke</b> and <b>did not sell him</b> the <b>oxen. But</b> if the mishna is referring to a place <b>where they also call oxen: <i>Tzimda</i>,</b> then the seller <b>sold him everything.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>No,</b> their dispute is <b>necessary in a place where they call a yoke: <i>Tzimda</i>, and</b> call <b>oxen: <i>Bakar</i>, but there are also</b> those <b>who call oxen: <i>Tzimda</i>.</b> Since it is unclear what is meant by the term: <i>Tzimda</i>, <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>the</b> sum of <b>money indicates</b> whether he purchased a yoke or oxen, <b>and the Rabbis hold</b> that <b>the</b> amount of <b>money does not</b> serve as <b>proof.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But if the</b> amount of <b>money does not</b> serve as <b>proof,</b> then in a case where the buyer paid two hundred dinars and received only a yoke, <b>let</b> the <b>transaction be nullified.</b>

Daf 78a

<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>the Rabbis do not</b> hold that in a case of exploitation of less than one-sixth one must return the money and that if it was more than one-sixth there is <b>nullification of</b> the <b>transaction,</b> can it be maintained that they do <b>not</b> accept these <i>halakhot</i>? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 56b) that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: Even</b> in the case of <b>one who sells a Torah scroll, an animal, or a pearl,</b> these items <b>are not</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>exploitation,</b> as they have no fixed price. The Rabbis <b>said to him:</b> The early Sages <b>stated</b> that <b>only these</b> items listed earlier in the mishna, i.e., land, slaves, and documents, are not subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of exploitation. Therefore, the Rabbis should agree that the sale of the yoke is nullified.
The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the mishna <b>that teaches</b> that according to the opinion of the Rabbis <b>the</b> sum of <b>money is not proof?</b> This means <b>that the transaction is nullified. And if you wish, say</b> instead that the sale of the yoke is not nullified, because <b>when the Sages spoke</b> of <b>exploitation and the nullification of a transaction,</b> they meant that these <i>halakhot</i> apply only in a case <b>where</b> the difference in price is an amount about <b>which one could be mistaken</b> and believe that this is the correct price. <b>But when</b> the difference in price is so great a sum <b>that one could not be mistaken,</b> this sale is <b>not</b> subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of exploitation. In that case, one must <b>say</b> that the buyer <b>gave</b> the extra money <b>to</b> the seller as <b>a gift;</b> he could not have thought that this was the actual price of the object.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who sells a donkey has not sold its vessels,</b> i.e., its equipment, with it. <b>Naḥum the Mede says:</b> He has <b>sold its vessels. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> There are <b>times</b> when the vessels <b>are sold,</b> and there are <b>times</b> when <b>they are not sold. How so? If the donkey was before him and its vessels</b> were <b>on it, and</b> the buyer <b>said to him: Sell me this donkey of yours, its vessels are sold.</b> If the buyer said to him: <b>Is the donkey yours;</b> I wish to purchase it, <b>its vessels are not sold.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ulla says:</b> The <b>dispute</b> in the mishna is referring <b>to</b> the donkey’s <b>sack and</b> the <b>saddlebag [<i>disakkaya</i>] and</b> the <b><i>kumni</i>,</b> a term explained later in the Gemara. <b>As the first <i>tanna</i> holds: An ordinary donkey is</b> used primarily <b>for riding,</b> and therefore these articles, which are not used for riding but for carrying burdens, are not included in the sale. <b>And Naḥum the Mede holds: An ordinary donkey is</b> used <b>for carrying burdens,</b> and therefore the items that serve this purpose are sold along with the donkey. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the saddle and the saddlecloth, the harness and the saddle band, everyone agrees</b> that <b>they are sold,</b> as they are used both for riding and for carrying burdens.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. If a seller says: <b>I am selling you a donkey and its vessels, this</b> one has <b>sold the saddle, and the saddlecloth, and the harness, and the saddle band. But he has not sold the sack, and the saddlebag, and the <i>kumni</i>. And when</b> the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer: I am selling <b>it and everything that is on it,</b> to you; the donkey and <b>all of these</b> items <b>are sold.</b> It can be inferred from here that the <b>reason that</b> the buyer <b>acquires the saddle and the saddlecloth</b> is <b>that</b> the seller <b>said to him:</b> I am selling you <b>a donkey and its vessels.</b> By inference, if the seller <b>did not say this,</b> the buyer does <b>not</b> acquire them.
The Gemara answers: <b>The same is true even if</b> the seller <b>did not say to him:</b> I am selling you <b>a donkey and its vessels.</b> In that case <b>as well, the saddle and the saddlecloth are sold. And this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us: That even though</b> the seller <b>said to him:</b> I am selling you <b>a donkey and its vessels,</b> the buyer still <b>does not acquire</b> the <b>sack and</b> the <b>saddlebag and</b> the <b><i>kumni</i>.</b>
The Gemara inquires: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>And</b> the <b><i>kumni</i>? Rav Pappa bar Shmuel said:</b> This is the <b>saddle</b> used <b>by women.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Does this <b>dispute</b> apply only to a case <b>where</b> the vessels <b>are on</b> the donkey, <b>but when</b> the vessels <b>are not on</b> the donkey, <b>Naḥum the Mede concedes to</b> the Rabbis that they are not sold? <b>Or perhaps</b> the <b>dispute</b> applies <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> the vessels <b>are not on</b> the donkey, <b>but when</b> the vessels <b>are on</b> the donkey <b>the Rabbis concede to Naḥum</b> that the vessels are sold. The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: <b>And when</b> the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer: I am selling <b>it and everything that is on it,</b> the donkey and <b>all of these</b> items <b>are sold.</b> In this case, the vessels are on the donkey, and everything is sold.
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <b>dispute</b> applies <b>when</b> the vessels <b>are on</b> the donkey, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> ruling? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> that although in general one does not acquire the vessels, if the seller explicitly says that he is selling the donkey and everything on it, the buyer acquires it all. <b>But if you say that</b> the <b>dispute</b> applies <b>when</b> the vessels <b>are not on</b> the donkey, <b>but when</b> the vessels <b>are on</b> the donkey <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>they are sold,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> ruling? Even according to the opinion of the Rabbis there is no need to say explicitly that he is selling everything.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the <b>dispute</b> applies <b>when</b> the vessels <b>are not on</b> the donkey, <b>and</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and</b> the language of the <i>baraita</i> should be emended to <b>say: And when he said to him:</b> I am selling <b>it and everything that is fit to be on it,</b> i.e., those items usually found on a donkey, everything is sold.
The Gemara suggests another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from the mishna. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> There are <b>times</b> when the vessels <b>are sold,</b> and there are <b>times when they are not sold. What, is it not</b> the case <b>that Rabbi Yehuda is referring to that which the first <i>tanna</i> said?</b> If so, the dispute between the Rabbis and Naḥum the Mede must be referring to a case where the vessels are on the donkey, as Rabbi Yehuda addresses the same set of circumstances. The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No, Rabbi Yehuda</b>

Daf 78b

<b>was speaking of a different matter</b> and was not necessarily addressing the same case discussed in the beginning of the mishna.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of the dilemma, as it was taught in the previous mishna: If one <b>sold a wagon he has not sold the mules</b> that pull the wagon. <b>And Rav Taḥlifa, from the West,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rabbi Abbahu:</b> If one <b>sold a wagon, he has sold the mules</b> along with it. <b>And</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>he has not sold</b> the mules? <b>And</b> Rav Taḥlifa <b>said to him: Should I erase</b> this <i>baraita</i>? <b>And</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to him: No,</b> you should <b>explain</b> that <b>your <i>baraita</i></b> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the mules <b>are fastened to</b> the wagon.
One can learn <b>by inference</b> from Rabbi Abbahu’s statement <b>that the mishna</b> is referring to a situation <b>where</b> the mules <b>are not fastened to</b> the wagon. <b>And since the first clause,</b> i.e., the previous mishna, is referring to a case corresponding to <b>where</b> the vessels <b>are not on</b> the donkey, i.e., the mules are not fastened to the wagon, <b>the latter clause,</b> the mishna here, must <b>also</b> be referring <b>to</b> a situation <b>where</b> the vessels <b>are not on</b> the donkey.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>On the contrary, say the first clause,</b> i.e., the preceding mishna: One who sells a ship sells the mast along with it, <b>but he has not sold either the slaves or the <i>antikei</i>. And we said: What</b> is the meaning of <b><i>antikei</i>? Rav Pappa said:</b> It means <b>the merchandise that is in</b> the ship. <b>But</b> according to your logic, <b>since the first clause,</b> i.e., the mishna concerning the ship, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the merchandise <b>is on</b> the ship, <b>the latter clause,</b> the mishna here, must <b>also</b> be referring to a case <b>where</b> the vessels <b>are on</b> the donkey. <b>Rather, the <i>tanna</i> teaches each statement</b> individually, and the circumstances of one ruling do not prove that another ruling is referring to a parallel case.
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> based on the letters of the names of the <i>tanna’im</i> who appear here: <b><i>Zayin</i>, <i>gimmel</i>, <i>mem</i>; <i>nun</i>, <i>samekh</i>, <i>nun</i>. Abaye said: Rabbi Eliezer, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and Rabbi Meir, and Rabbi Natan, and Sumakhos, and Naḥum the Mede all hold</b> that <b>when a person sells an item, he sells it and all of its accoutrements.</b>
<b>Rabbi Eliezer</b> holds this, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (67b) that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: One who sells an olive press has sold the beam</b> used for pressing the olives, despite the fact that the beam can be removed from the press. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> holds this, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (68b) that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: One who sells a city has sold the</b> city’s <b>guardsman. Rabbi Meir</b> holds this, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> If one <b>sold a vineyard, he has sold the accoutrements of the vineyard. Rabbi Natan and Sumakhos</b> hold this, as they state with regard to <b>the <i>bitzit</i> and the <i>dugit</i>,</b> i.e., the light-going boats of the ship, which they claim are sold when the ship is sold (73a). <b>Naḥum the Mede</b> holds this, as is evident from <b>that which we said</b> in the mishna here.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> There are <b>times</b> when the vessels <b>are sold,</b> and there are times when they are not sold. How so? If the donkey was before him and its vessels were on it, and the buyer said to him: Sell me this donkey of yours, its vessels are sold. If the buyer said: Is the donkey yours? I wish to purchase it, its vessels are not sold. The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> in a case where the buyer said: Sell me <b>this donkey of yours, and what is different</b> in a case where he said: <b>Is the donkey yours?</b>
<b>Rava said</b> that when the buyer says: Sell me <b>this donkey of yours, he knows that the donkey belongs to</b> the seller, <b>and</b> as for <b>that which he said to him: This, he said</b> that <b>to him due to its vessels.</b> By contrast, when the buyer says: <b>Is the donkey yours,</b> this indicates <b>that</b> the buyer <b>does not know that the donkey belongs to</b> the seller, <b>and this</b> is what <b>he is saying to him: Is the donkey yours that you can sell it to me?</b> In this case, he is interested only in the donkey and not its vessels.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who sells</b> a female <b>donkey has sold</b> its <b>foal</b> along with it. But one who <b>sold a cow has not sold its young.</b> One who <b>sold a dunghill has sold its manure.</b> One who <b>sold a cistern has sold its water.</b> One who <b>sold a beehive has sold the bees</b> in it, and likewise one who <b>sold a dovecote has sold</b> the <b>doves.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that if one sells a donkey he has sold its foal, but if one sells a cow he has not sold its calf. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances? If</b> this is a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>says to the</b> buyer that he is selling <b>it and its young, even the cow and its young</b> should be sold <b>as well. If</b> this is a case <b>where he does not say to him</b> that he is selling <b>it and its young, even the donkey</b> should <b>not</b> be sold with its foal.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>said to the</b> buyer: <b>I am selling you a nursing donkey, or:</b> I am selling you <b>a nursing cow. Granted,</b> with regard to the <b>cow, one could say that he needs it for its milk,</b> and the suckling calf would not necessarily be included in the sale. <b>But</b> with regard to the <b>donkey,</b> for <b>what</b> reason <b>is he saying to him</b> that the donkey is nursing? Since he does not need the milk of a donkey, <b>learn from here</b> that <b>he is saying to him</b> that he is selling <b>it and its young.</b> The Gemara adds tangentially: <b>And why</b> does the mishna <b>call</b> a donkey foal <b>a <i>seyaḥ</i>?</b> It is <b>because it follows after</b> and obeys <b>pleasant talk [<i>siḥa</i>],</b> whereas an old donkey must be led forcibly.
The Gemara cites a related discussion. <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “Therefore they that speak in parables [<i>hamoshlim</i>] say:</b> Come to Heshbon! Let the city [<i>ir</i>] of Sihon be built and established! For a fire is gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it has devoured Ar of Moab, the lords of the high places of Arnon” (Numbers 21:27–28)?
The Gemara interprets these verses homiletically. <b>“<i>Hamoshlim</i>”; these are</b> the people <b>who rule over [<i>hamoshlim</i>] their</b> evil <b>inclination.</b> They will say: <b>“Come to Heshbon,”</b> meaning: <b>Come and let us calculate the account of [<i>ḥeshbono</i>] the world,</b> i.e., the financial <b>loss</b> incurred by the fulfillment of <b>a mitzva in contrast to its reward, and the reward</b> for committing <b>a transgression,</b> i.e., the pleasure and gain received, <b>in contrast to the loss it</b> entails.
<b>“Let it be built and established”</b> means that <b>if you</b> make this calculation, <b>you will be built in this world and you will be established in the World-to-Come.</b> The phrase <b>“city [<i>ir</i>] of Sihon”</b> means that <b>if a person fashions himself like this young donkey [<i>ayir</i>] that follows after pleasant talk [<i>siḥa</i>],</b> i.e., if one is easily tempted to listen to his inclination, <b>what is written after it? “For a fire is gone out of Heshbon…</b>it has devoured,” i.e., <b>a fire will go out from</b> those <b>who calculate</b> the effect of their deeds in the world, <b>and will consume those who do not calculate</b> and examine their ways but instead do as they please.
A similar interpretation applies to the continuation of the verse: <b>“A flame from the city of Sihon”;</b> this means that a flame will come <b>from the city of righteous people, who are called trees [<i>siḥin</i>]. “It has devoured Ar of Moab”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who follows after his inclination like this young donkey [<i>ayir</i>] that follows after pleasant talk. “The lords of the high places of Arnon”; this</b> is referring to <b>the arrogant. As the Master says: Every person who has arrogance in him will fall into Gehenna.</b>
The Gemara interprets a subsequent verse: “We have shot at them [<i>vanniram</i>], Heshbon is perished, even until Dibon, and we have laid waste even until Nophah, which reaches until Medeba” (Numbers 21:30). <b>“<i>Vanniram</i>”;</b> this indicates that the <b>wicked</b> person <b>says: There is no higher [<i>ein ram</i>]</b> power governing the world. <b>“Heshbon is perished”</b> means: <b>The account [<i>ḥeshbon</i>] of the world has perished,</b> i.e., they claim there is no accountability for one’s actions. <b>“Even until Dibon [<i>divon</i>]”; the Holy One, Blessed be He, says: Wait until judgment comes [<i>yavo din</i>]. “And we have laid waste</b>

Daf 79a

<b>even until Nophah,”</b> meaning <b>until the fire comes that does not require fanning [<i>nippuaḥ</i>],</b> i.e., the fire of Gehenna, which will consume them. <b>“Until Medeba [<i>Medeva</i>]”;</b> this means <b>until their souls are pained [<i>tadiv</i>]. And some say</b> an alternative explanation: It means <b>until</b> God <b>does what He wishes [<i>mai deva’ei</i>]</b> with them and punishes them as they deserve.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who separates</b> himself <b>from matters of Torah, a fire consumes him, as it is stated: “And I will set My face against them; out of the fire they come forth, and the fire shall devour them”</b> (Ezekiel 15:7). The Torah is likened to fire in the verse: “Is not My word like fire?” (Jeremiah 23:29). The verse in Ezekiel teaches: “Out of the fire they come forth,” referring to those who separate themselves from the fire of Torah; “and the fire shall devour them,” i.e., they are consumed by the fire of Gehenna.
<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Anyone who separates himself from the matters of Torah falls into Gehenna. As it is stated: “The man who strays out of the way of understanding shall rest in the congregation of the spirits”</b> (Proverbs 21:16). “The way of understanding” is the way of the Torah. <b>And</b> one who departs from the Torah arrives in the place of the <b>spirits,</b> which <b>is nothing other than Gehenna, as it is stated: “But he does not know that the spirits are there; that those whom she has called are in the depths of the netherworld”</b> (Proverbs 9:18).
§ The mishna teaches: One who <b>sold a dunghill has sold its manure,</b> and one who sold a cistern has sold its water. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Me’ila</i> 12b): With regard to <b>any</b> item that is <b>fit to</b> be sacrificed on <b>the altar but</b> is <b>not</b> fit <b>for Temple maintenance,</b> or is fit <b>for Temple maintenance but not for the altar,</b> or items that are fit <b>neither for the altar nor for Temple maintenance</b> in their current state and are slated to be sold with the profit used for the Temple, in all these cases if one consecrates these items and then derives benefit <b>from them or their contents</b> for a non-sacred purpose, he thereby is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property and is obligated to bring an offering as atonement.
<b>How so?</b> One who <b>consecrated a cistern filled with water, dunghills filled with manure, a dovecote filled with doves, a field filled with plants,</b> or <b>a tree bearing fruit,</b> and subsequently derived benefit <b>from them or their contents</b> is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property.
<b>But</b> with regard to one who <b>consecrated a cistern and it was later filled with water, a dunghill and it was later filled with manure, a dovecote and it later was filled with doves, a tree and it later bore fruit,</b> or <b>a field and it was later filled with plants,</b> if he derives benefit <b>from them</b> he is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property but he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property by deriving benefit from <b>its contents.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> With regard to one who <b>consecrated a field or a tree,</b> he is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property if he derives benefit from <b>them or that which grows from them, because they are growths of consecrated</b> property.
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears</b> to be correct <b>in</b> the cases of <b>a cistern and a dovecote,</b> i.e., if one consecrated an empty cistern or dovecote, the water or doves that later fill it do not become consecrated. <b>And the statement of Rabbi Yosei</b> appears to be correct <b>in</b> the cases of <b>a field and a tree.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the meaning of <b>this</b> statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi? <b>Granted,</b> when he says that <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears</b> to be correct <b>in</b> the cases of <b>a cistern and a dovecote, by inference</b> this means <b>that</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagrees</b> with Rabbi Yosei <b>in</b> the cases of <b>a field and a tree,</b> and Rabbi Yehuda does explicitly disagree in those cases.
<b>But</b> when Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says that <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei appears</b> to be correct <b>in</b> the cases of <b>a field and a tree,</b> this indicates <b>by inference that</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>disagrees</b> with Rabbi Yehuda <b>in</b> the cases of <b>a cistern and a dovecote. But Rabbi Yosei stated</b> his opinion solely <b>in</b> the cases of <b>a field and a tree,</b> as only plants and fruit grow directly from consecrated property, and this reasoning is not relevant in the case of a cistern or dovecote.
<b>And if you would say</b> that Rabbi Yosei <b>stated</b> his opinion <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> whereas he himself holds that even the items found in a dovecote or a cistern are consecrated, this is difficult: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei said: I do not see the statement of Rabbi Yehuda</b> as correct <b>in</b> the cases of <b>a field and a tree, because</b> the plants and the fruit <b>are the growths of consecrated</b> property? Infer from here that it is <b>in</b> the cases of <b>a field and a tree that</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>does not see</b> and accept the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. <b>But in</b> the cases of <b>a cistern and a dovecote, he</b> does <b>see</b> and accept his opinion.
The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>is saying: The statement of Rabbi Yehuda appears to Rabbi Yosei</b> to be correct <b>in</b> the cases of <b>a cistern and a dovecote.</b> In other words, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is saying <b>that even Rabbi Yosei disagrees with</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>only in</b> the cases of <b>a field and a tree. But in</b> the cases of <b>a cistern and a dovecote, he concedes to him</b> that the prohibition against misuse of consecrated property does not apply to items that were added afterward and were not present at the time of the consecration.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> In the case of cisterns, with regard to one who <b>consecrated them</b> when they were <b>empty and they were later filled,</b> if one derives benefit <b>from them</b> he is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property, <b>but</b> he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property if he derives benefit <b>from their contents.</b> This ruling will be clarified below. <b>Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says:</b> One is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>even</b> by deriving benefit <b>from their contents.</b>
<b>Rabba says:</b> This <b>dispute</b> in the <i>baraita</i> applies only <b>in</b> the cases of <b>a field and a tree, as the first <i>tanna</i> holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. But in</b> the cases of <b>a cistern and a dovecote, everyone agrees</b> that if one derives benefit <b>from them</b> he is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property <b>but</b> he is <b>not</b> liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property if he derives benefit <b>from their contents.</b>
<b>Abaye said to him: But</b> consider <b>that which is taught</b> in the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>consecrated them</b> when they were <b>full</b> and then derives benefit <b>from them or from their contents,</b> he is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property. <b>And Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, reverses</b> his previous ruling in this case and holds that if the items were consecrated when full their contents are not subject to the prohibition against misuse of consecrated property.

Daf 79b

<b>And if</b> their dispute is referring <b>to a field and a tree, why does</b> Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, <b>reverse</b> his opinion? <b>Rather,</b> Rabba’s statement must be adjusted, and this is what <b>Rabba said:</b> This <b>dispute</b> between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, applies only <b>in</b> the cases of <b>a cistern and a dovecote. But in</b> the cases of <b>a field and a tree, everyone agrees</b> that one is liable for <b>misuse</b> of consecrated property if one derives benefit <b>from them or their contents.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And in</b> the cases of <b>a cistern and a dovecote, where</b> the cistern and the dovecote <b>are empty, with regard to what</b> matter <b>do they disagree? And</b> similarly, <b>where</b> the cistern and the dovecote <b>are full, with regard to what do they disagree?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>In</b> the cases of a cistern and a dovecote that <b>are empty, they disagree with regard to</b> the matter that is the subject of <b>the dispute between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis.</b>
The first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, disagree <b>because the first <i>tanna</i> holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, who say: A person cannot transfer</b> ownership of <b>an object that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world,</b> i.e., that one does not currently own. Therefore, one cannot consecrate water or doves that will enter the cistern or dovecote only in the future. <b>And Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can transfer</b> ownership of <b>an object that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world.</b>
The Gemara raises a difficulty with regard to this answer: You can <b>say that you heard Rabbi Meir</b> express this opinion in a case <b>such as</b> the <b>fruit of palm trees, which are likely to come</b> into existence, as the trees naturally produce fruit. But with regard to <b>these</b> doves and water, <b>who can say that they will come? Rava said: You</b> can <b>find</b> cases where one consecrates water or doves that are likely to arrive, e.g., <b>in</b> the case of <b>water that comes by way of his courtyard into the cistern</b> when it rains, so that he does not need to fill the cistern. <b>And</b> similarly with regard to <b>doves that come by way of his</b> other, full <b>dovecote into</b> this empty <b>dovecote.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in cases <b>where</b> the cistern and the dovecote <b>are full, with regard to what</b> matter <b>do they disagree? Rava said:</b> This dispute concerns a case <b>where he consecrated a cistern without specification. And Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>his father, who says: One infers the <i>halakha</i></b> of consecration to the <b>Most High from the <i>halakha</i></b> of transactions between one <b>ordinary</b> person <b>[<i>hedyot</i>]</b> and another.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Just as the <i>halakha</i></b> with regard to transactions between one <b>ordinary</b> person and another is that <b>one can say: I sold you the cistern</b> but <b>I did not sell you the water</b> it contains, <b>so too, the <i>halakha</i></b> in the case of consecration to the <b>Most High</b> is that one can say: <b>I consecrated the cistern</b> but <b>I did not consecrate the water</b> within it. <b>And the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>one does not infer the <i>halakha</i></b> of consecration to the <b>Most High from the <i>halakha</i></b> of transactions between one ordinary person and another. Rather, one who consecrates property does so generously, i.e., the most expansive meaning is assumed for his vow of consecration, and therefore even if he did not say so explicitly, he consecrated the water together with the cistern.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> does <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> concerning a transaction with <b>an ordinary</b> person say that one does <b>not</b> sell the water along with the cistern? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (78b) that one who <b>sold a cistern has sold its water? Rava said:</b> The ruling in <b>the mishna is an individual</b> opinion, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One who <b>sold a cistern has not sold its water. Rabbi Natan says:</b> One who <b>sold a cistern has sold its water.</b>

Daf 80a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who buys the produce of a dovecote from another,</b> i.e., the doves that will hatch over the course of the year in a dovecote, <b>must leave [<i>mafriaḥ</i>]</b> the <b>first</b> pair of doves from the <b>brood</b> for the seller. If one buys <b>the produce of a beehive,</b> i.e., all the bees produced from a beehive over the course of the year, the buyer <b>takes three swarms and</b> then the seller <b>renders</b> the bees <b>impotent,</b> so that they will stop producing offspring and instead produce only honey. One who buys <b>honeycombs must leave two combs.</b> If one buys <b>olive</b> trees <b>for felling, he must leave two shoots</b> for the seller.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who buys the brood of a dovecote must leave the first pair of the brood for the seller. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that one must leave the <b>first and</b> the <b>second</b> pairs of <b>a brood</b> for the seller? <b>Rav Kahana said:</b> This is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement in the mishna is referring to the pair left <b>for</b> the first pair of the brood <b>itself,</b> i.e., an extra pair of doves must be left behind to ensure that the first brood will not fly away. <b>That</b> statement of the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a pair left <b>for the mother</b> of the pair discussed in the mishna. In other words, the <i>baraita</i> is saying that one must leave a pair of doves for the mother, and later a second pair from the brood of her children, which is the pair mentioned by the mishna.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>the mother</b> that there is no concern that she will escape from the dovecote? If the reason is <b>that she is attached to her daughter and the mate which one leaves for her,</b> this should also be true with regard to the daughter, i.e., <b>she too will become attached to her mother and the mate which one leaves for her.</b> Why, then, is it necessary to leave behind a pair of the daughter’s own brood to ensure that the daughter will not leave? The Gemara answers: <b>A mother is attached to her daughter,</b> whereas <b>a daughter is not attached to her mother.</b> Therefore, in order for the daughter to remain in the dovecote it is necessary to leave the daughter’s brood with her.
§ The mishna teaches that one who buys the <b>produce of a beehive takes three swarms and</b> then the seller <b>renders</b> the bees <b>impotent [<i>mesares</i>].</b> The Gemara asks: <b>By what</b> means <b>does he render them impotent? Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Shmuel said:</b> He renders them impotent <b>by</b> feeding them <b>mustard. They say in the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>in the name of Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina:</b> It is <b>not</b> the <b>mustard</b> itself that <b>renders them impotent. Rather, since their mouths sting</b> from the bitterness of the mustard, <b>they return and eat their own honey.</b> Due to their excessive eating of honey, they cease to form new swarms and instead produce honey for the seller.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This is not the meaning of <i>mesares</i>. Rather, the mishna should be understood as follows: One <b>takes three swarms by skipping [<i>beseirus</i>]</b> every other swarm, so that the buyer receives the first, third, and fifth swarms, while the others remain with the seller. <b>It is taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> The buyer <b>takes</b> the first <b>three swarms one after the other,</b> and <b>from this</b> point <b>forward he takes one and leaves one.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that one who buys <b>honeycombs must leave two combs</b> and one who buys olive trees for felling must leave two shoots. <b>Rav Kahana says:</b> As long as <b>honey</b> remains <b>in the beehive it never leaves</b> its status as <b>food,</b> i.e., it is always considered fit for human consumption. The Gemara notes: <b>Apparently,</b> Rav Kahana <b>holds</b> that honey <b>does not require</b> that one have <b>intention</b> to eat it for it to be susceptible to ritual impurity.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Honey in a beehive is not</b> considered to have the status of <b>either food or liquid</b> with regard to ritual impurity. <b>Abaye said:</b> This <i>halakha</i>, that honey is considered neither food nor liquid, <b>is necessary only with</b> regard to <b>those two combs</b> mentioned in the mishna, which are designated for the sustenance of the bees and are not for human consumption. <b>Rava said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion <b>of Rabbi Eliezer.</b>

Daf 80b

<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 10:7): Concerning <b>a beehive, Rabbi Eliezer says: It is</b> considered <b>like land</b> with regard to the manner in which one purchases it and with regard to other matters, <b>and</b> therefore <b>one writes a document that prevents the Sabbatical Year from canceling an outstanding debt [<i>prosbol</i>]</b> based <b>on it,</b> as a <i>prosbol</i> can be written only if the debtor possesses land of some sort.
<b>And</b> a beehive <b>is not susceptible to ritual impurity,</b> provided that it is <b>in its place</b> and attached to the ground, as it is considered equivalent to the ground itself, which is not susceptible to impurity. <b>And one who takes</b> honey <b>out of it on Shabbat</b> is <b>liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering,</b> like one who uproots something from the ground. According to this opinion, honey in a beehive is not considered to have the status of either food or liquid with regard to ritual impurity, as it is attached to the ground.
The mishna continues: <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> A beehive has the status of movable property; <b>one may not write a <i>prosbol</i></b> based <b>on it, and it is not</b> considered <b>like land</b> with regard to its sale but is instead sold in the manner of movable property. <b>And it is susceptible to ritual impurity</b> even when it is <b>in its place, and one who takes</b> honey <b>out of it on Shabbat is exempt</b> from bringing a sin-offering. According to this opinion, the honey contained within the beehive is considered detached from the ground and is therefore susceptible to ritual impurity, as stated by Rav Kahana.
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer? As it is written</b> with regard to Jonathan: “He put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand, <b>and dipped it in the honeycomb [<i>ya’arat hadevash</i>]”</b> (I Samuel 14:27). <b>Now, what does a forest [<i>ya’ar</i>] have to do with honey [<i>devash</i>]?</b> Why is the honeycomb called a forest of honey [<i>ya’arat hadevash</i>]? <b>Rather,</b> this serves <b>to tell you: Just as</b> with regard to <b>a forest, one who picks</b> fruit <b>from</b> a tree <b>on Shabbat is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering, so too,</b> with regard to <b>honey, one who removes</b> honey <b>from</b> a beehive <b>on Shabbat is liable</b> to bring <b>a sin-offering.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Honey that flows from one’s beehive is not</b> considered <b>either food or liquid. Granted, according to</b> the reasoning of <b>Abaye</b> this <b>works out well,</b> since he would explain here, as in the previous case, that this is referring to the two combs in the beehive designated for the sustenance of the bees, and is not intended for human consumption.
<b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rava,</b> who says that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the ruling of Rabbi Eliezer, this presents <b>a difficulty,</b> as even according to Rabbi Eliezer the honey is not considered attached to the ground once it leaves the beehive. <b>Rav Zevid said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the honey <b>flowed onto a repulsive vessel</b> and therefore is unfit for human consumption. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov said:</b> It is referring to a case <b>where it flowed onto straw [<i>kashkashin</i>]</b> and weeds, which renders it inedible.
The Gemara <b>raises</b> another <b>objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Honey in one’s beehive is not</b> considered <b>either food or liquid.</b> If <b>one intended to</b> use <b>it</b> as <b>food, it</b> is susceptible to <b>ritual impurity</b> as <b>food,</b> and if one intended <b>to</b> use it as <b>liquid, it is susceptible to ritual impurity as liquid. Granted, according to</b> the reasoning of <b>Abaye,</b> this <b>works out well,</b> as he can explain that this too is referring to the two combs of honey left for the bees, and that if one reconsidered and decided to eat the honey, it is once again considered fit for human consumption.
<b>But according to Rava,</b> who said that the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> that honey in a beehive does not have the status of food or liquid is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, this poses <b>a difficulty.</b> This <i>baraita</i> does not accord with the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer, as he maintains that one’s intention is not enough for honey attached to the ground to be considered as though it were detached. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> must be in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, and yet it contradicts Rav Kahana’s statement that intention is not required for honey to be susceptible to ritual impurity.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rava</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is in fact in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer, and you should resolve the difficulty <b>and answer like this:</b> If <b>one intended to</b> use the honey as <b>food, it</b> is <b>not</b> susceptible to <b>ritual impurity</b> as <b>food,</b> and if one intended <b>to</b> use it as <b>liquid, it is not susceptible to ritual impurity</b> as <b>liquid.</b> The Gemara notes: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Kahana: Honey in one’s beehive is susceptible to ritual impurity</b> as <b>food</b> even if there was <b>no intention</b> to use it as food, as it has an innate status of food.
§ The mishna teaches: If one buys <b>olive</b> trees <b>for felling, he must leave two shoots</b> from the tree. <b>The Sages taught: One who buys a tree from another for felling must cut</b> the tree <b>one handbreadth above the ground,</b> to allow the tree to grow again. In the case of <b>an untrimmed sycamore,</b> he must cut the tree a minimum of <b>three handbreadths</b> above the ground, and with regard to <b>a large sycamore,</b> which has strong roots because the sycamore has been cut down once already, he must cut the tree a minimum of <b>two handbreadths</b> above the ground. <b>In</b> the case <b>of reeds or of vines,</b> he may cut only <b>from the knot and above,</b> so that they will grow back. <b>In</b> the cases <b>of palm and of cedar</b> trees, <b>he may dig down and uproot</b> them, <b>because their trunks do not replenish</b> themselves after they are cut down, and therefore there is no reason to leave anything behind.
The Gemara asks: <b>And do we require an untrimmed sycamore</b> to be cut a minimum of <b>three handbreadths</b> above the ground for it to grow back? <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 4:5): <b>One may not fell an untrimmed sycamore during the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>because it is</b> considered <b>work,</b> as it promotes the growth of the tree.
The mishna continues. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is <b>prohibited</b> for one to fell the tree during the Sabbatical Year <b>in its</b> usual <b>manner; rather, he must cut</b> the tree <b>ten handbreadths</b> above the ground, <b>or raze</b> the tree until it is <b>even with the ground.</b> Neither of these methods promote the growth of the tree; in fact, they damage it. It can be inferred from here that it is only cutting the sycamore until it is <b>even with the ground that is harmful</b> for it, and it does not grow again. Cutting in <b>another</b> manner <b>is beneficial for it,</b> even if it is cut less than three handbreadths from the ground.
<b>Abaye said</b> that the mishna should be understood as follows: Cutting down a sycamore from a height of <b>three handbreadths is beneficial for it,</b> whereas cutting it so that it is <b>even with the ground is certainly harmful for it</b> and is permitted during the Sabbatical Year. Cutting it down <b>from this</b> point <b>onward,</b> i.e., between the ground and three handbreadths, is <b>neither</b> very <b>harmful for it nor</b> particularly <b>beneficial for it. With regard to the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>we perform</b> only <b>a matter that is certainly harmful to it,</b> so as to avoid enhancing it. <b>With regard to buying and selling, we perform</b> only <b>a matter that is certainly beneficial for it,</b> as the seller intended to sell the sycamore in such a manner that the tree would grow again.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches: In the case <b>of palm and cedar trees,</b> a buyer may <b>dig down and uproot</b> them, <b>because their trunks do not replenish</b> themselves after being cut down. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it correct with regard to <b>a cedar</b> that <b>its trunk does not replenish</b> itself? <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Lulyani teach: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon”</b> (Psalms 92:13)? <b>If “palm tree” is stated, why is “cedar” stated? And if “cedar” is stated, why is “palm tree” stated?</b> What is added by this double comparison?
Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Lulyani explains: <b>Had</b> the verse <b>stated</b> only <b>“cedar” and had not stated “palm tree,” I would have said</b> that <b>just as a cedar does not produce fruit, so too, a righteous person does not produce fruit,</b> i.e., he will have no reward in the World-to-Come. <b>Therefore, it is stated: “Palm tree,”</b> which is a fruit-bearing tree.
<b>And had</b> the verse <b>stated</b> only <b>“palm tree” and had not stated “cedar,” I would have said</b> that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>a palm tree its trunk does not replenish</b> itself after being cut down, <b>so too,</b> in the case of <b>a righteous person, his trunk does not replenish</b> itself, i.e., he will be unable to recover from misfortune. <b>There-fore, it is stated: “Cedar,”</b> to indicate that just as the trunk of the cedar replenishes itself, so too, the righteous will thrive again. This demonstrates that the trunk of a cedar does grow again.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, with what are we are dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with other types of cedars,</b> as the trunks of certain species do not grow back after the tree is felled. This is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna. As Rabba bar Rav Huna says</b> that <b>they say</b> in <b>the school of Rav: There are ten types of cedars; as it is stated: “I will place in the wilderness the cedar [<i>erez</i>], the acacia tree [<i>shitta</i>], and the myrtle [<i>hadas</i>] and the pine tree [<i>etz shemen</i>]; I will set</b> in the desert the juniper [<i>berosh</i>], the teak [<i>tidhar</i>], and the cypress [<i>te’ashur</i>] all together” (Isaiah 41:19). The Gemara elaborates: <b><i>Erez</i></b> means <b>cedar; <i>shitta</i></b> means <b>acacia tree [<i>tornita</i>]; <i>hadas</i></b> is the <b>myrtle; <i>etz shemen</i></b> is the <b>balsam tree; <i>berosh</i></b> means <b>juniper [<i>berati</i>]; <i>tidhar</i></b> is the <b>teak [<i>shaga</i>]; and <i>te’ashur</i></b> is the <b>cypress [<i>shurbina</i>].</b>
The Gemara asks: But <b>these are seven</b> species of cedar, not ten. <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia <b>he said: They added to</b> the list of cedars <b><i>allonim</i>, <i>almonim</i>,</b> and <b><i>almugim</i>. <i>Allonim</i></b> refers to <b>pistachio trees [<i>butnei</i>], <i>almonim</i></b> are <b>oaks [<i>balutei</i>],</b> and <b><i>almugim</i></b>

Daf 81a

refers to <b>coral trees [<i>kasita</i>]. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that the other three are as follows: <b><i>Aronim</i>, <i>armonim</i>, and <i>almugim</i>. <i>Aronim</i></b> refers to <b>laurel trees [<i>arei</i>], <i>armonim</i></b> to <b>plane trees [<i>dulevei</i>],</b> and <b><i>almugim</i></b> to <b>coral trees [<i>kasita</i>].</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who buys two trees in the field of another, this</b> one has <b>not acquired</b> any <b>ground,</b> but only the trees. <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> He has <b>acquired</b> the <b>ground</b> under them. The mishna states a <i>halakha</i> in accordance with the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>: If the trees <b>grew,</b> the owner of the field <b>may not cut down</b> their branches, despite the fact that their shade damages his field. <b>And that which grows out of the trunk</b> is <b>his,</b> i.e., it belongs to the owner of the tree, <b>but</b> that which grows <b>out of the roots</b> belongs <b>to the owner of the ground. And if</b> the trees <b>died,</b> their owner <b>has no</b> rights to the <b>ground</b> where the trees had stood.
If one <b>bought three</b> trees, he has <b>acquired</b> the <b>ground</b> along with them. If <b>they grew,</b> the owner of the field <b>may cut down</b> their branches, as he sold a specific piece of land along with the trees, not his entire field. <b>And that which grows out of the trunk and out of the roots</b> is <b>his,</b> i.e., it belongs to the owner of the trees. <b>And if</b> the trees <b>died,</b> the owner of the trees still <b>has</b> possession of the <b>ground,</b> as it was sold along with the trees.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Bikkurim</i> 1:6): With regard to <b>one who buys two trees in</b> the field <b>of another, he brings</b> the first fruits <b>but does not recite</b> the passages of thanks to God that appear in the Torah (Deuteronomy 26:1–11), as the land does not belong to him and therefore he cannot state: “I have brought the first of the fruit of the land, which You, Lord, have given me” (Deuteronomy 26:10). <b>Rabbi Meir says: He brings</b> the first fruits <b>and</b> also <b>recites</b> the passage.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: Rabbi Meir would obligate even one who buys fruit from the marketplace</b> to bring first fruits, not only one who grew the fruits on his own tree. <b>From where</b> did he derive this <i>halakha</i>? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches</b> an apparently <b>superfluous mishna. Since</b> Rabbi Meir already <b>taught</b> in the mishna here <b>that</b> the owner of two trees <b>has</b> possession of the <b>ground,</b> isn’t it <b>obvious that he brings</b> first fruits <b>and recites</b> the passage? What is added by his statement in the mishna in <i>Bikkurim</i>?
<b>Rather, learn from</b> the mishna in <i>Bikkurim</i> that <b>Rabbi Meir would obligate even one who buys fruit from the marketplace</b> to bring first fruits to the Temple. Rabbi Meir is saying that even if the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis that one who buys two trees does not own the ground between them, he still must bring the first fruits and recite the passage of thanks.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written: “Which you shall bring in from your land”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:2)? This verse indicates that the fruit must be the produce of your land, not land that belongs to another. The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> verse serves <b>to exclude</b> land that is <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, which is not the land of the Jewish people. It does not exclude land that does not belong to that specific individual.
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “The choicest first fruits of <b>your land</b> you shall bring” (Exodus 23:19)? The Gemara answers: This serves <b>to exclude</b> fruit bought by a Jew that was grown on the <b>land of a gentile</b> in Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it written:</b> “I have brought the first of the fruit of the land, <b>which You,</b> Lord, <b>have given me”</b> (Deuteronomy 26:10)? If he purchased the fruit, then the land on which it grew was not given to him by God. The Gemara answers that the phrase “which You have given me” can mean <b>that You have given me money, and with that</b> money <b>I bought</b> this fruit.
<b>Rabba raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Shmuel from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who buys one tree in</b> the field <b>of another brings</b> first fruits <b>but does not recite</b> the passage, <b>as he did not acquire</b> any <b>land;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> This is <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of Shmuel’s opinion, as he said that according to Rabbi Meir even one who simply purchases fruit is obligated to bring first fruits to the Temple.
Apropos the discussion of the obligation to bring first fruits of one who buys a tree in the field of another, <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim said to Rabbi Elazar:</b>

Daf 81b

<b>What is the rationale of Rabbi Meir</b> that <b>in</b> the case of <b>one tree,</b> an individual is obligated to bring first fruits but does not recite the passage, <b>and what is the rationale of the Rabbis</b> that <b>in</b> the case of <b>two trees,</b> an individual is obligated to bring the first fruits but does not recite the passage? If one owns the ground and is obligated to bring the first fruits to the Temple, he should also recite the passage of thanks. If he does not own the ground and therefore is not obligated to recite the passage, why does he bring the first fruits to the Temple? Rabbi Elazar <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Elyakim: <b>Do you ask me</b> publicly, <b>in the study hall,</b> about <b>a matter for which the early</b> Sages <b>did not give a reason, in order to embarrass me?</b> In other words, I do not know the reason, as not even the early Sages explained this matter.
<b>Rabba said: What is the difficulty? Perhaps Rabbi Meir is uncertain, in</b> the case of an individual who purchases <b>one tree,</b> whether or not the buyer owns the ground, <b>and the Rabbis are uncertain, in</b> the case of an individual who purchases <b>two trees,</b> whether or not the buyer owns the ground. Due to this uncertainty, the owner of the tree must bring the first fruits to the Temple, as he might be obligated in this mitzva. He does not recite the passage of thanks because it is not definitely established that he is obligated to bring the fruits.
The Gemara asks: <b>And is</b> Rabbi Meir really <b>uncertain</b> whether the buyer owns the ground? <b>But it teaches: Since he did not acquire</b> any <b>land;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> Rabbi Meir states definitively that the owner of the tree does not own the ground. The Gemara answers: <b>Say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> should be emended as follows: <b>Perhaps he did not acquire</b> any <b>land.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But let us be concerned that perhaps</b> these fruits <b>are not first fruits, and he is bringing non-sacred</b> fruit <b>to the</b> Temple <b>courtyard,</b> which is prohibited. The Gemara answers: The case is <b>where he consecrates them.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> the priest <b>is required to eat</b> first fruits, and he cannot do so if they are consecrated. The Gemara answers: The case is <b>where</b> the priest <b>redeems them.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps they are not first fruits, and</b> thereby <b>he removes them from</b> the obligation of <b><i>teruma</i> and tithes,</b> as one does not separate <i>teruma</i> and tithes from first fruits. The Gemara answers: The case is <b>where he separates</b> <i>teruma</i> and tithes from the fruits, due to the uncertainty over their status.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the <b><i>teruma gedola</i></b> that he separates from these fruits <b>he gives to a priest,</b> and the priest may partake of it, as it has the halakhic status of either first fruits or <i>teruma gedola</i>, both of which are eaten by a priest. It is understood with regard to the <b>second tithe as well; he gives it to a priest,</b> who eats it in Jerusalem, either as first fruits or as second tithe. If it is the third or the sixth year of the Sabbatical cycle, when instead of second tithe one is obligated to give the <b>poor man’s tithe,</b> here <b>too, he gives it to a poor priest,</b> who eats it as either first fruits or poor man’s tithe. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>first tithe, which is</b> given to <b>a Levite, to whom can he give it?</b> A Levite may not eat first fruits.
The Gemara answers: The case is <b>where he gives it to a priest, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Teruma gedola</i></b> is given only <b>to a priest,</b> and <b>first tithe</b> is given only <b>to a Levite;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: First tithe</b> may <b>also</b> be given <b>to a priest.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps they are</b> in fact <b>first fruits and require recitation</b> of the passage of thanks, and yet the owner does not recite it due to the uncertainty. The Gemara answers: The <b>recitation</b> is <b>not indispensable,</b> i.e., one can perform the mitzva of bringing first fruits without the recitation.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is the recitation <b>not</b> indispensable? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Zeira say</b> in the context of offerings: For <b>any</b> measure of flour <b>that</b> is <b>suitable for mixing</b> with oil in a meal-offering, the lack of <b>mixing does not invalidate</b> the meal-offering. Even though there is a mitzva to mix the oil and the flour <i>ab initio</i>, the meal-offering is fit for sacrifice even if the oil and the flour are not mixed. <b>And</b> for <b>any</b> measure of flour <b>that</b> is <b>not suitable for mixing</b> with oil in a meal-offering, the lack of <b>mixing invalidates</b> the meal-offering. The principle is: <i>Ab initio</i> requirements prevent the fulfillment of a mitzva in situations where they are not merely absent but impossible. Accordingly, first fruits that are unfit for recitation should not be brought to the Temple.
The Gemara answers: The case is <b>where he renders them</b> exempt from the obligation of recitation, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina, who says:</b> If one <b>harvested</b> the fruits <b>and sent them in the possession of an agent, and</b> the <b>agent died on the way,</b> the owner or any other person <b>brings</b> the first fruits <b>but does not recite</b> the passage of thanks. <b>What is the reason? As it is written: And you shall take, and you shall bring.</b> The Gemara is citing from the following verse with a slight variation: “And you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you shall bring in from your land that the Lord your God gives you” (Deuteronomy 26:2).

Daf 82a

The passage is not recited <b>until the taking and the bringing</b> of the first fruits are performed <b>by one</b> person, <b>and that is not</b> the case here. <b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: Since</b> the passage <b>is</b> composed of <b>verses, let him read them.</b> What is objectionable about reciting verses from the Torah?
Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> The problem is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> this practice <b>has the appearance of falsehood,</b> because he issues a declaration before God that is possibly untrue, as he might not own the ground. <b>Rav Mesharshiyya, son of Rav Ḥiyya, said:</b> The declaration is not recited <b>lest he come to remove</b> the fruits <b>from</b> their obligation of <b><i>teruma</i> and tithes,</b> if they are treated entirely as first fruits. For this reason one does not recite the passage, to ensure that their unique status is maintained.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to one who buys two trees in the field of another, if the trees <b>grew,</b> the owner of the field <b>may not cut down</b> their branches. The mishna further teaches: That which grows out of the trunk belongs to the owner of the tree, but that which grows out of the roots belongs to the owner of the ground. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> in which something is considered to be growing <b>out of the trunk, and what are the circumstances</b> in which it is considered to be growing <b>out of the roots?</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> With regard to <b>anything that sees the face of the sun,</b> i.e., which is visible and aboveground, <b>this is</b> considered to be growing <b>out of the trunk. And</b> with regard to that <b>which does not see the face of the sun</b> but is concealed in the earth, <b>this is</b> considered to be growing <b>out of the roots.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if everything that is visible belongs to the owner of the tree, no matter how close it is to the ground, <b>let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps the land is covered with sediment</b> from flowing water, and some of the tree’s trunk will be covered, in which case the branches that grow from the trunk will appear as though they are separate trees; <b>and</b> the owner of the trees will <b>say to</b> the owner of the field: <b>You</b> actually <b>sold me three</b> trees <b>and I</b> therefore <b>have</b> ownership over the <b>ground. Rather, Rav Naḥman said:</b> That which grows from the trunk belongs to the owner of the tree, but <b>he must cut</b> it down. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> himself <b>likewise said:</b> The owner of the tree <b>must cut</b> it down.
<b>Rav Naḥman said: We hold</b> by tradition that <b>a palm tree</b> bought from another <b>has no trunk. Rav Zevid thought to say</b> this means that <b>the owner of the palm tree has no</b> right to that which grows from the <b>trunk.</b> The reason is <b>that since it stands</b> ready <b>to be dug up and uprooted,</b> as when the tree dies its owner is not entitled to plant another in its place, <b>he diverts his mind</b> from that which grows from the trunk.
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this: But</b> this is comparable to one who <b>buys two trees</b> in a field belonging to another, <b>as</b> the trees <b>stand</b> ready <b>to be dug up and uprooted</b> because their owner has no right to plant new trees in their place when they die; <b>and</b> yet it <b>is taught</b> in the mishna <b>that he has</b> the right to that which grows from the <b>trunk. Rather, Rav Pappa said:</b> The statement of Rav Naḥman means that <b>the owner of a palm tree,</b> in contrast to owners of other types of trees, <b>has no</b> right to that which grows from the <b>trunk, since</b> a palm tree <b>does not produce</b> branches from its <b>trunk.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Zevid,</b> who maintains that Rav Naḥman is referring to all types of trees, <b>the mishna</b> is <b>difficult.</b> The Gemara answers: Rav Zevid interprets the mishna as referring to a situation <b>where</b> the owner of the trees <b>bought</b> the trees <b>for five years</b> and stipulated that he may plant new trees in place of the original trees in the event the original ones are cut down.
§ The mishna teaches: If <b>one bought three</b> trees <b>he has acquired</b> the <b>ground</b> along with them. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> of the field does he acquire? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This</b> buyer <b>has acquired</b> the ground that is located <b>underneath</b> the trees, <b>and</b> the area <b>between them, and</b> with regard to the space <b>outside of</b> the trees and their branches,

Daf 82b

he has acquired an area <b>sufficient for a gatherer of figs and his basket</b> in hand to stand close to the tree. <b>Rabbi Elazar objects to this: Now</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is that the buyer <b>has no path</b> and must purchase a path through the field to access his trees; if so, does <b>he have</b> possession of an area for <b>the gatherer and his basket?</b> The Gemara elaborates: <b>He has no path,</b> even though he has no other means of gaining access to the trees, <b>as</b> the ground he acquired along with the trees <b>is</b> considered <b>another land</b> and is not part of the rest of the field. Why, then, would <b>he have</b> possession of an area for <b>a gatherer and his basket?</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira says: From the statement,</b> i.e., the objection, <b>of our teacher, we learn</b> that <b>it is</b> in the case of <b>three</b> trees <b>that</b> the owner of the trees <b>has no path,</b> as the buyer acquired a separate piece of land along with the trees. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>two</b> trees the buyer <b>has</b> a path, <b>as he says to</b> the owner of the field: My trees <b>are standing on your land,</b> and as I am allowed to use your field to tend to my trees I have the right to walk through your land to reach them.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: Shall we say</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar does not</b> accept the opinion <b>of Shmuel,</b> who was <b>his teacher? As Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who says: One who sells, sells generously.</b> According to Rabbi Akiva, one sells in a manner that is advantageous for the buyer, and is presumed to have included in the sale even items that were not explicitly specified. In this case, as he has sold a tree that remains on his property, the seller grants the buyer the right to access his tree.
Rava <b>said to him:</b> Even if Rabbi Elazar himself agrees with Rabbi Akiva, <b>the mishna cannot be explained in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva.</b> Rather, the mishna must be in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, who hold that one who sells does so sparingly, and the difficulty that Rabbi Elazar raised against Rabbi Yoḥanan is predicated on the fact that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis.
<b>From where</b> does Rava derive that the mishna is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva? <b>From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches:</b> If the three trees <b>grew,</b> the owner of the land <b>may cut down</b> the branches that extend into his field. <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, why may he cut</b> them <b>down? Doesn’t</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>say</b> that <b>one who sells, sells generously?</b>
Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak <b>said to him:</b> This does not prove that the mishna is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. You can <b>say that Rabbi Akiva stated</b> his ruling <b>in the case of a pit and a cistern</b> that are situated in a field belonging to another, which one sells in a generous manner, <b>as they do not weaken the land.</b> But <b>did you hear him</b> say that the seller is generous toward the buyer <b>with regard to a tree,</b> which can weaken the land?
<b>Doesn’t Rabbi Akiva concede in</b> the case of <b>a tree that leans out into the field of another,</b> in <b>which</b> the owner of the other field <b>cuts down</b> the branches until the <b>full</b> height of <b>an ox-goad,</b> the handle that protrudes <b>over a plow?</b> Since the extending branches impede his efforts to plow his field, it is permitted for him to cut them down. This indicates that even according to Rabbi Akiva one does not grant privileges that are detrimental to his own interests. If so, the mishna can be explained even in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Akiva, which indicates that Rabbi Elazar does not accept his ruling.
The Gemara points out: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba:</b> If one buys three trees in a field belonging to another, <b>this</b> buyer <b>has acquired</b> the ground that is found <b>underneath</b> the trees, <b>and</b> the area <b>between them, and outside of</b> the trees and their branches <b>an area</b> sufficient for <b>a gatherer of figs and his basket.</b>
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Those</b> areas around the trees that are designated for <b>a gatherer of figs and his basket</b> are used for this purpose only at specific times. <b>Who sows</b> that land during the rest of the year, the owner of the trees or the owner of the field? Rav Yosef <b>said to him: You learned</b> the answer in a mishna (99b): If one owns a garden that is surrounded by the garden of another, the owner of the inner garden has a right to a path through the outer garden. Even so, the owner of <b>the outer</b> garden <b>may sow the path.</b>
Abaye <b>said to him: Are</b> the cases <b>comparable? There,</b> in the case of the outer and inner gardens, <b>there is no loss</b> suffered <b>by the buyer</b> when the owner of the outer garden sows the path, as he can still pass through it. <b>But here, there is a loss for the buyer, as</b> the one who bought the trees <b>says to</b> the owner of the field: The <b>fruits</b> that fall from the trees will become <b>soiled</b> by the plants.
<b>This</b> case is <b>similar only to the last clause</b> of that mishna, which states: If the owner of the inner garden is given a side path, so that he suffers a loss of some kind because he cannot take the shortest path to reach his garden, both <b>this</b> owner of the inner garden <b>and that</b> owner of the outer garden <b>are not permitted to sow</b> the path. Similarly, here too, neither the owner of the trees nor the owner of the field are permitted to sow the place designated for the gatherer of figs and his basket.
The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Abaye: This</b> buyer <b>has acquired</b> the ground that is found <b>underneath</b> the trees, <b>and</b> the area <b>between them, and outside of</b> the trees and their branches <b>an area</b> sufficient for <b>a gatherer of figs and his basket. And</b> both <b>this</b> owner of the field <b>and that</b> owner of the trees <b>are not permitted to sow it.</b>
The Gemara inquires: <b>And how much</b> space <b>must there be between</b> the three trees for them to be considered one unit, which means that the land is acquired by the owner of the trees? <b>Rav Yosef</b> says that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The distance between the trees must be <b>from four cubits to eight</b> cubits. <b>Rava</b> says that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> It must be <b>from eight</b> cubits <b>to sixteen</b> cubits. <b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: Do not disagree with Rav Naḥman, as we learned</b> in <b>a mishna in accordance with his</b> opinion.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 4:9): <b>One who plants his vineyard sixteen cubits by sixteen cubits,</b> i.e., he leaves sixteen cubits between each row of vines, is <b>permitted to bring</b> other species of <b>seeds</b> to the empty spaces between the rows and sow them <b>there.</b> This is not considered a violation of the biblical prohibition with regard to sowing diverse crops in a vineyard, which is one of the prohibitions of diverse kinds.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda said: There was an incident in</b> the city of <b>Tzalmon, where one</b> individual <b>planted his vineyard sixteen by sixteen cubits. And he would turn the branches</b> of <b>two rows</b> that were facing each other <b>to one side,</b> so that there was a space of sixteen cubits between the two rows, <b>and sow the clearing. The following year he would turn the branches to the place</b> that was <b>sown</b> the year before, <b>and would sow</b> the land that had been left <b>uncultivated</b> the previous year, as it had been filled with the branches from the vines. <b>And the incident came before the Sages and they permitted it.</b> This demonstrates that sixteen cubits between plants is required for them to be considered separate units.
Rav Yosef <b>said to him: I do not know</b> about this, <b>but there was</b> a similar <b>incident</b>

Daf 83a

involving the sale of trees <b>in a village of shepherds, and they came before Rav Yehuda, and he said to</b> the seller: <b>Go</b> and <b>give to</b> the one who bought the trees <b>sufficient</b> land <b>for an ox and its vessels. But I did not know how much</b> was <b>sufficient</b> land <b>for an ox and its vessels. When I heard that which we learned</b> in a mishna (26a), I came to a conclusion with regard to this case. The mishna teaches as follows: <b>A person may not plant a tree close by the field of another, unless he places it at a distance</b> of <b>four cubits from</b> the other field.
Rav Yosef continues: <b>And it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> this mishna: The <b>four cubits that</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> are <b>for the work of the vineyard,</b> so that he does not take oxen and a plow into his neighbor’s field while tending to his vineyard. <b>I</b> studied this mishna and <i>baraita</i> and <b>said: Learn from it</b> that the phrase: <b>Sufficient for the ox and its vessels,</b> means <b>four cubits.</b> At this stage, the Gemara has demonstrated that Rav Naḥman’s opinion is supported by a mishna, whereas Rav Yosef’s ruling is supported by the incident involving Rav Yehuda.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we</b> also <b>learn</b> a ruling in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 4:9) <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef?</b> That mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon say:</b> In a case of <b>one who plants his vineyard eight cubits by eight</b> cubits, i.e., he leaves eight cubits between each row of vines, it is <b>permitted</b> for him <b>to bring seeds to</b> the empty spaces between the rows. This ruling can be cited in support of the opinion of Rav Yosef that if there is a space of eight cubits between trees or vines they are not considered one unit. Why, then, is this mishna not brought as proof?
The Gemara answers: <b>Even so,</b> it is <b>preferable</b> to cite the <b>incident</b> in Tzalmon as proof. Whenever possible, it is preferable to provide support for an opinion by means of a practical ruling, as it demonstrates that the Sages took action in accordance with that opinion and did not merely teach it as <i>halakha</i> in theory.
The Gemara comments: <b>Granted, according to</b> the analysis of <b>Rav Yosef</b> stated <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Shimon, we hear</b> about the maximum distance that the trees can be <b>scattered, and we hear</b> about the minimum distance that they can be planted <b>close together.</b> The distance that the trees can be <b>scattered</b> is <b>that which we said,</b> i.e., eight cubits. The minimum distance that they can be planted <b>close together</b> is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 5:2): <b>A vineyard that is planted</b> in consecutive rows <b>with less than four cubits</b> between the rows <b>is not</b> classified as <b>a vineyard,</b> because the rows are planted too close together. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Shimon. And the Rabbis say:</b> It is considered <b>a vineyard, and one views the middle</b> vines <b>as if they are not</b> there, as they are slated to be uprooted.
<b>But according to</b> the analysis of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> stated <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis, we hear</b> the maximum distance that the trees can be <b>scattered,</b> i.e., sixteen cubits, as in the incident in Tzalmon. Concerning the minimum distance that they can be planted <b>close together, did we hear</b> this distance? The Gemara answers: This <b>is</b> based on <b>logical reasoning; from</b> the fact <b>that according to Rabbi Shimon</b> the minimum distance is <b>half</b> of the maximum distance, according <b>to the Rabbis as well,</b> the minimum distance is <b>half</b> of the maximum, i.e., eight cubits.
<b>Rava says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that one who buys three trees acquires the land if the distance between the trees is anywhere <b>from four cubits to sixteen</b> cubits. This ruling is a combination of the two opinions, which is favorable to the buyer. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava: How close</b> may <b>they be? Four cubits. And how far apart</b> may <b>they be? Sixteen</b> cubits.
If one bought three trees planted in this manner, <b>this one has acquired</b> the <b>land and the</b> small <b>trees that</b> are <b>between them. Therefore,</b> if <b>the tree dried up or was cut down he has</b> ownership of the <b>land.</b> If the distance between the trees was <b>less than this or more than this, or if he bought</b> the trees <b>one after the other, this</b> buyer <b>has not acquired either the land or the trees that</b> are <b>between them. Therefore,</b> if <b>the tree dried up or was cut down he has no</b> ownership over the <b>land.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma: When one measures</b> the distance between the trees, <b>does he measure from the narrow place</b> on the trunk of the tree <b>or does he measure from the wide place? Rav Geviha of Bei Khatil said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:1): When one comes to measure from <b>the layered branch of the vine he measures only from the second root,</b> as this is the average, not the widest part of the vine.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises a dilemma:</b> If the owner of the field <b>sold to</b> someone <b>three branches</b> that grew from one <b>tree,</b> and its trunk was covered with earth so that the branches appeared to be three separate trees, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Are they considered three trees, which would mean that their owner acquires the ground between them?
<b>Rav Geviha of Bei Khatil said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 7:2): With regard to <b>one who layers</b> the branches of <b>three vines</b> into the ground so that they take root while still attached to the base of the vine, <b>and their roots</b> that rise above the ground <b>are visible, Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: If there is</b> a distance <b>between them of four cubits to eight</b> cubits, <b>they combine</b> to form one vineyard composed of six grapevines. <b>And if not, they do not combine.</b> It can be inferred from this mishna that the different branches of a tree are considered separate entities when the trunk is covered by earth, provided the required distance between them is maintained.
<b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> If the owner of a field <b>sold to</b> someone <b>two</b> trees <b>in his field and one</b> situated <b>on</b> its <b>border, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Similarly, if one bought <b>two</b> trees <b>in</b> the field <b>of</b> one person <b>and one in</b> the field <b>of another, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Do the trees combine to form one unit of three trees, or not? The Gemara states that this dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.

Daf 83b

<b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> In the case of <b>a pit</b> situated between the trees, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the possibility <b>that it divides</b> between the trees, and therefore the owner of the trees does not acquire the ground? Similarly, in the case of <b>a stream of water, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the possibility <b>that it divides</b> between the trees? With regard to the <b>public thoroughfare</b> that divides between trees, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Finally, in the case of <b>a line of palm trees, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? No answer is found for these problems, and the Gemara states that the dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Hillel raises a dilemma before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: If <b>a cedar grew between</b> the three trees that one bought, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara asks: If it <b>grew,</b> then it <b>emerged in his domain,</b> as he already owns the ground, and therefore it is obvious that the cedar belongs to him. <b>Rather,</b> the dilemma is as follows: If, when one bought three trees, <b>there</b> already <b>was a cedar between them, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered a division between the three trees? Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him:</b> Since he bought the trees, <b>he</b> has thereby <b>acquired</b> the cedar <b>and acquired</b> the land between them.
The Gemara asks: <b>In what manner</b> must the three trees be <b>positioned</b> for the buyer to acquire the ground between them? <b>Rav says:</b> They may be planted <b>in a straight line, and Shmuel says:</b> They must be planted <b>in</b> the form of <b>a tripod.</b> The Gemara notes: According to <b>the one who says</b> that the trees may be positioned <b>in a straight line, all the more so</b> one acquires the ground when the trees are planted <b>in</b> the form <b>a tripod. But</b> according to <b>the one who says</b> they must be positioned <b>in a tripod,</b> the buyer acquires the ground only in this case; <b>but</b> if the trees were planted <b>in a straight line,</b> he does <b>not</b> acquire the ground. <b>What is the reason?</b> It is <b>because</b> when the trees are planted in the form of a straight line <b>one can sow between them,</b> and therefore the seller would not relinquish his right to the ground between the trees.
<b>Rav Hamnuna objects to this: And according to the one who says</b> that the trees must be planted <b>in</b> the form of <b>a tripod, what is the reason</b> that one who buys the trees acquires the ground? Is it <b>that one cannot sow between</b> the trees? <b>But if that is so,</b> in a case where <b>he sold him three Roman thorny shrubs, where one cannot sow between them, so too</b> would he say <b>that</b> the purchaser <b>has</b> ownership of the <b>ground?</b> The other Sage <b>said to</b> Rav Hamnuna: <b>Those</b> Roman shrubs <b>are not significant,</b> as they are merely shrubs and not trees, and therefore the ground is not acquired when one purchases them. By contrast, <b>these</b> trees <b>are important.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who sells the head</b> of <b>a large domesticated animal has not sold</b> along with it <b>the forelegs,</b> as each part is considered important in its own right. All the more so, if one <b>sold the forelegs he has not sold the head.</b> Similarly, if one <b>sold the windpipe</b> and the lungs <b>he has not sold the liver,</b> despite the fact that they are sometimes attached, and if he <b>sold the liver he has not sold the windpipe</b> and lungs. <b>But in</b> the case of <b>small</b> domesticated animals, if one <b>sold the head he has sold the forelegs,</b> although if one <b>sold the legs he has not sold the head.</b> Likewise, if one <b>sold the windpipe</b> and lungs <b>he has sold the liver,</b> but if he <b>sold the liver he has not sold the windpipe</b> and lungs.
There are <b>four</b> basic <b>cases with regard to sellers</b> and buyers. If the seller <b>sold him wheat</b> and said that the wheat was <b>good, and it is found</b> to be <b>bad, the buyer,</b> but not the seller, <b>can renege on</b> the sale. If the seller sold him what he thought was <b>bad</b> wheat <b>and it is found</b> to be <b>good, the seller can renege on</b> the sale but the buyer cannot. If he sold <b>bad</b> wheat <b>and it is found</b> to be <b>bad,</b> or <b>good</b> wheat <b>and it is found</b> to be <b>good, neither one of them can renege on</b> the sale, as the condition of the sale was met.
If the seller sold <b>reddish-brown</b> wheat <b>and it is found</b> to be <b>white,</b> or <b>white</b> wheat <b>and it is found</b> to be <b>reddish-brown,</b> and similarly, if he sold <b>olive wood and it is found</b> to be wood <b>of a sycamore,</b> or he sold wood <b>of a sycamore and it is found</b> to be wood <b>of an olive</b> tree, or if the seller sold him <b>wine and it is found</b> to be <b>vinegar,</b> or <b>vinegar and it is found</b> to be <b>wine,</b> in all of these cases <b>both</b> the seller and the buyer <b>can renege on</b> the sale. Since the sale was for a different item than that which was delivered, the transaction can be nullified even if there was no mistake with regard to the price.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> If the seller <b>sold him</b> an item that was <b>worth five</b> dinars <b>for six</b> dinars, <b>and</b> the item <b>became more expensive and</b> its value <b>stood at eight</b> dinars, and the seller wished to return the money and cancel the sale because the item’s value had increased, <b>who was exploited</b> here? <b>The buyer;</b> therefore, <b>the buyer, but not the seller, can renege on</b> the sale, despite the fact that in such a situation the seller loses out. This is <b>because</b>

Daf 84a

the buyer can <b>say to</b> the seller: <b>If you had not exploited me, you would not be able to renege on</b> the sale, and I would receive the profit. <b>Now that you have exploited me, can you renege on</b> the sale and benefit? <b>And</b> similarly, <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna also <b>taught:</b> If the seller sold him wheat while claiming that the wheat was <b>good, and it is found</b> to be <b>bad, the buyer can renege on</b> the sale. This implies that the buyer can renege <b>but not the seller,</b> even in a situation where the seller would want to renege on the sale, e.g., if the item became more expensive.
<b>And</b> similarly, <b>Rav Ḥisda says:</b> If he <b>sold him</b> an item that was <b>worth six</b> dinars <b>for five</b> dinars, <b>and its price was reduced and</b> its value now <b>stood at three</b> dinars, <b>who was exploited</b> in this case? <b>The seller;</b> therefore, <b>the seller, but not the buyer, can renege on</b> the sale. The reason is <b>that</b> the seller <b>can say to him: If you had not exploited me, you would not be able to renege on</b> the sale. <b>Now</b> that you have exploited me, <b>can you renege on</b> the sale? <b>And</b> similarly, <b>the <i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna also <b>taught:</b> If the seller sold him <b>bad</b> wheat <b>and it is found</b> to be <b>good, the seller can renege on</b> the sale, <b>but not the buyer.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rav Ḥisda <b>teaching us? It is</b> all already taught in <b>the mishna.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If</b> the <i>halakha</i> were derived <b>from the mishna</b> alone, <b>I would say</b> that <b>perhaps</b> in the cases brought <b>by Rav Ḥisda, both</b> the buyer and the seller <b>are able to renege on</b> the sale. The reason is that this is a case of exploitation, as the item was sold for more than its value, and therefore as long the buyer can renege on the sale, the sale is not complete. Consequently, as the seller lost out as well, he can also renege on the sale. <b>And</b> as for <b>the mishna,</b> it <b>comes to teach us that</b> if the seller said that he is selling good wheat and it is found to be bad, <b>the buyer can renege on</b> the sale, as this is considered a case of exploitation.
It is necessary to teach this, <b>as</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that this is not a case of exploitation <b>because it is written: “It is bad, it is bad, says the buyer;</b> but when he is gone his way, then he boasts” (Proverbs 20:14). In other words, it is the usual manner of sellers to praise their merchandise, while buyers disparage it. Therefore, the mishna teaches that the buyer can renege on the sale if the item was found to be bad, and the seller can change his mind if it was found to be good.
§ The mishna teaches that if the seller said that he was selling <b>reddish-brown [<i>sheḥamtit</i>]</b> wheat <b>and it is found</b> to be <b>white,</b> both the seller and the buyer can renege on the sale. The Gemara assumes that <i>sheḥamtit</i> means the color of the sun [<i>ḥama</i>]. Therefore, <b>Rav Pappa said: From</b> the fact <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches: White,</b> in contrast to <i>sheḥamtit</i>, and there are two types of wheat, one white and the other red, <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that <b>this sun is red,</b> not white. <b>Know</b> that this is the case, <b>as it reddens in</b> the <b>morning and evening. And</b> the reason <b>that we do not see</b> the red color <b>all day</b> is because <b>our eyesight is not strong</b> and we cannot discern the redness of the sun.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to this claim: With regard to a verse that speaks of leprosy: <b>“And, behold, if its appearance is deeper than the skin”</b> (Leviticus 13:30), the Sages explain: This means that it is <b>like the appearance of the sun,</b> which is <b>deeper than the shadow. But there,</b> leprosy <b>is white</b> and yet it is likened to the sun. The Gemara answers: There, it means that it <b>has an appearance like the sun</b> in certain respects, <b>but</b> it is <b>not like the appearance of the sun</b> in all respects. It is <b>like the appearance of the sun</b> in <b>that</b> it is <b>deeper than the shadow, and</b> it is <b>not</b> entirely <b>like the appearance of the sun, as there</b> the leprous spot is <b>white, and here</b> the sun is <b>red.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to that which entered our mind initially,</b> that the sun is white, doesn’t <b>it redden in</b> the <b>morning and evening?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>In the morning</b> it becomes red <b>as it passes over the site of</b> the <b>roses of the Garden of Eden,</b> whose reflections give the light a red hue. <b>In the evening</b> the sun turns red <b>because</b> it <b>passes over the entrance of Gehenna,</b> whose fires redden the light. <b>And there are</b> those <b>who say the opposite</b> in explaining why the sun is red in the morning and the evening, i.e., in the morning it passes over the entrance of Gehenna, while in the evening it passes over the site of the roses of the Garden of Eden.
§ The mishna teaches: If the seller sold <b>wine and it is found</b> to be <b>vinegar, both</b> the seller and the buyer <b>can renege on</b> the sale. The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>the mishna is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>:

Daf 84b

<b>Wine and vinegar are one type</b> of food, which means that if, for example, one separated <i>teruma</i> from one of these with the intention that it should exempt the other, his action is effective. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> They are <b>two types</b> of food. Apparently, the mishna is not in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis in the <i>baraita</i>. The Gem ara rejects this claim: <b>You</b> may <b>even say</b> that the mishn a is in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> as <b>the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>only with regard to</b> the issue of whether one can separate <b>tithe and <i>teruma</i></b> from wine to redeem vinegar and vice versa. <b>And</b> the Rabbis hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ela.</b>
<b>As Rabbi Ela says: From where</b> is it derived <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>separates <i>teruma</i> from poor</b>-<b>quality</b> produce <b>for superior</b>-<b>quality</b> produce, i.e., in order to fulfill the obligation of separating <i>teruma</i> from the high-quality produce, <b>that his <i>teruma</i></b> is valid <b><i>teruma</i>? As it is stated: “And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, seeing as you have set apart from it its best”</b> (Numbers 18:32).
The verse is understood as indicating that one who sets aside inferior produce has sinned. It also demonstrates that if one did, in fact, set aside <i>teruma</i> from poor-quality produce in order to render permitted superior-quality produce, his action is effective and the inferior produce is sanctified as <i>teruma</i>. The reason is that <b>if</b> the inferior produce <b>is not consecrated, why</b> would one <b>bear a sin?</b> It should be considered as though he did nothing. <b>From here</b> it is derived <b>with regard to</b> one who <b>separates <i>teruma</i> from poor</b>-<b>quality</b> produce <b>for superior</b>-<b>quality</b> produce <b>that his <i>teruma</i></b> is valid <b><i>teruma</i>.</b> The Rabbis agree and hold that in the case of one who separates vinegar in order to redeem wine, his <i>teruma</i> is valid despite the difference in quality, as wine and vinegar are considered a single type of food.
<b>But with regard to buying and selling, everyone,</b> including the Rabbis, agrees that wine and vinegar are two types of food, as they have different uses. <b>There are</b> those <b>for whom wine is preferable and vinegar is not preferable, and there are</b> those <b>for whom vinegar is preferable and wine is not preferable.</b>
mishna This mishna discusses several methods of acquiring movable property. With regard to <b>one who sells produce to another,</b> if the buyer <b>pulled</b> the produce <b>but did not measure</b> it, <b>he has acquired</b> the produce through the act of acquisition of pulling. If <b>he measured</b> the produce <b>but did not pull</b> it, <b>he has not acquired</b> it, and either the seller or the buyer can decide to rescind the sale. <b>If</b> the buyer <b>is perspicacious</b> and wants to acquire the produce without having to pull it, and he wishes to do so before the seller could change his mind and decide not to sell, <b>he rents its place,</b> where the produce is located, and his property immediately effects acquisition of the produce on his behalf.
With regard to <b>one who buys flax from another,</b> because flax is usually carried around <b>this</b> purchaser <b>has not acquired</b> it <b>until he carries it from place to place</b> and acquires it by means of the act of acquisition of lifting. Pulling the flax is ineffective. <b>And if it was attached to the ground, and he detached any amount,</b> he has <b>acquired</b> it, as the Gemara will explain.
gemara The mishna mentions several modes of acquisition without elaboration. It does not explain in which domain the act takes place, whether on the property of the seller or in the public domain. Likewise, it does not specify who performs these actions. The Gemara clarifies these details. <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If the seller <b>measured</b> the produce <b>and placed</b> it <b>in an alleyway,</b> which is not the public domain but a location where people can keep their belongings, then even if the buyer did not pull the produce, he <b>acquires</b> it.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said to Rabbi Asi: Perhaps my teacher heard</b> this <i>halakha</i> from Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>only with regard to one who measures into his basket,</b> i.e., that of the buyer, in which case his possessions effect acquisition of the produce for him. But if the produce is placed on the floor of the alleyway, the buyer does not acquire the produce. Rabbi Asi <b>said to him: This one of the Sages,</b> i.e., Rabbi Zeira, <b>seems like one who has not studied <i>halakha</i>.</b> If he <b>measured</b> it <b>into the basket</b> of the buyer, is it <b>necessary to say</b> that he acquires it? If an item is placed in the buyer’s basket it is clearly acquired by him, regardless of the location of the basket. Rather, Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement with regard to an alleyway must be referring to items placed on the floor of the alleyway.
The Gemara asks: Did Rabbi Zeira <b>accept</b> this claim <b>from</b> Rabbi Asi, <b>or</b> did <b>he not accept</b> it <b>from him?</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as Rabbi Yannai says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> With regard to <b>a courtyard belonging to partners,</b> which is similar in status to an alleyway, the partners <b>acquire from one another. What, is it not</b> correct to say that there is no difference between placing items on the ground and in their basket, as a partner acquires an item even when it is placed <b>upon the ground,</b> in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Asi? The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>No,</b> this is referring to a case where the item is measured <b>into the basket</b> of the buyer.
The Gemara points out: <b>So, too,</b> Rabbi Zeira’s statement <b>is reasonable, as Rabbi Ya’akov says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> If one <b>measured and placed</b> an item <b>in an alleyway,</b> the buyer <b>has not acquired</b> it. Apparently, these two <i>halakhot</i> cited in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>are difficult,</b> as they contradict <b>each other,</b> since earlier it was stated that according to Rabbi Yoḥanan the buyer can acquire an item in this manner. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> this apparent contradiction that <b>here,</b> i.e., in the statement cited by Rabbi Asi, he is referring <b>to one who measures into the basket</b> of the buyer, which effects acquisition; and <b>there,</b> i.e., in the statement of Rabbi Yaakov, he is referring <b>to one who measures onto the ground,</b> which does not effect acquisition. The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from it</b> that this is the case.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: If <b>he measured</b> the produce <b>but did not pull</b> it, <b>he does not acquire</b> it. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to one who did so <b>in an alleyway,</b> which indicates that placing produce on the ground of an alleyway does not effect acquisition, in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Zeira? The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>No,</b> the mishna is referring to one who did so <b>in the public domain.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, say the first clause:</b> If the buyer <b>pulled</b> the produce <b>but did not measure</b> it, <b>he has acquired</b> the produce. But <b>does pulling in the public domain effect acquisition?</b>
<b>But don’t Abaye and Rava both say</b> that <b>passing effects acquisition in the public domain and in a courtyard that</b> does <b>not belong to either of them; pulling effects acquisition</b> only <b>in an alleyway or in a courtyard that belongs to both of them,</b> but not in the public domain; <b>and lifting effects acquisition in every place,</b> even in the seller’s domain? This demonstrates that pulling in the public domain does not effect acquisition.
The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: If <b>he pulled</b> it, <b>that is taught</b> in the mishna? It means that he pulled it <b>from the public domain into an alleyway.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, say the latter clause: If</b> the buyer <b>is perspicacious he rents its place,</b> i.e., where the produce is located. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>But if</b> the mishna is referring to a spot <b>in the public domain, from whom can he rent</b> the place where the produce is located? The Gemara answers: The latter clause is referring to a separate <i>halakha</i>, and <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: And if</b> the produce is <b>in a domain</b> that has <b>an owner, if he is perspicacious he rents the place</b> where the produce is located from the owner.
§ The Gemara continues to discuss the manner in which an acquisition takes place. <b>Rav and Shmuel both say:</b>

Daf 85a

<b>A person’s vessels effect acquisition</b> of any item placed inside them <b>for him, in any place</b> in which they are situated, <b>except for the public domain. And Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish both say: Even in the public domain,</b> one’s vessels effect acquisition of items placed in them.
<b>Rav Pappa said:</b> These <i>amora’im</i> <b>do not disagree: Here,</b> when Rav and Shmuel state that one’s vessel does not effect acquisition for him, they are speaking of a vessel placed <b>in the public domain; there,</b> when Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish state that his vessel effects acquisition on his behalf, they are referring to a vessel located <b>in an alleyway. And why do they call</b> an alleyway <b>the public domain?</b> The reason is <b>that</b> an alleyway is <b>not a private domain.</b>
The Gemara points out: <b>So, too, it is reasonable</b> to interpret Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement in this manner, <b>as Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A person’s vessels effect acquisition for him in any place where he has permission to keep them.</b> It can be inferred from here: In a location where <b>he has permission</b> to keep them, <b>yes,</b> his vessels effect acquisition for him. But in a place where <b>he does not have permission</b> to keep his vessels, they do <b>not</b> effect acquisition for him, and one has permission to keep his vessels in an alleyway but not in the public domain. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> this statement that when Rabbi Yoḥanan referred to the public domain he meant an alleyway.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a difficulty from a <i>baraita</i>: There are <b>four cases with regard to sellers,</b> i.e., four methods through which merchandise is acquired. When the seller measures merchandise for the buyer, <b>before the measuring</b> vessel <b>has been filled</b> the merchandise in the vessel still belongs <b>to the seller</b> and he can change his mind and cancel the sale. <b>Once the measuring</b> vessel <b>has been filled</b> the merchandise belongs <b>to the buyer. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said when the seller measures <b>with a measuring</b> vessel <b>that does not belong to either of them. But if the measuring</b> vessel <b>belonged to one of them,</b> the buyer <b>acquires</b> the items of sale <b>one</b> by <b>one</b> as they are placed in the measuring vessel.
<b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said when the seller measures the items <b>in the public domain or in a courtyard that does not belong to either of them. But</b> if it happens <b>in the domain of</b> the <b>seller,</b> the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> the merchandise <b>until he lifts</b> the measuring vessel <b>or until he moves it out of the domain</b> of the seller. If it is <b>in the domain of</b> the <b>buyer, once</b> the <b>seller accepts upon himself</b> to sell, the <b>buyer acquires</b> it. If the merchandise is located <b>in the domain of this</b> individual <b>with whom it had been deposited,</b> the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> it <b>until</b> the bailee <b>accepts upon himself</b> to designate a place where the merchandise is to be stored for the buyer, <b>or until</b> the buyer <b>rents</b> from the bailee <b>the place</b> where the merchandise is situated.
<b>In any event,</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches with regard to</b> a transaction in <b>the public domain or in a courtyard that does not belong to either of them</b> that if the measuring vessel belonged to one of them, the buyer acquires the items of sale one by one as they are placed in the vessel.

Daf 85b

<b>What,</b> is it <b>not</b> stating that a buyer’s vessels effect acquisition of items on his behalf even <b>in the actual public domain,</b> which contradicts Rav Pappa’s explanation? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>an alleyway,</b> not the actual public domain. The Gemara asks: How can this be what the <i>baraita</i> means? <b>But</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that it is <b>similar to a courtyard that does not belong to either of them,</b> i.e., a location to which neither of them have any rights, whereas they both have some rights in an alleyway. Consequently, this must be referring to the actual public domain, not an alleyway.
The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>A courtyard that does not belong to either of them?</b> It <b>also</b> refers to shared property, specifically a courtyard shared by partners, <b>which does not</b> belong to <b>this</b> one <b>entirely and does not</b> belong to <b>that</b> one <b>entirely, but rather</b> it is the property <b>of both of them.</b> Consequently, this courtyard is comparable to an alleyway.
<b>Rav Sheshet raises a dilemma before Rav Huna:</b> If the <b>vessels of the buyer</b> are <b>in the domain of the seller,</b> does the <b>buyer acquire</b> the merchandise once it is placed in his vessels <b>or not?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: You learned</b> the answer already in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 77a): A wife is divorced when her husband hands her a bill of divorce or places it in a manner that is considered equivalent to handing it to her, e.g., placing in her courtyard. Accordingly, if the husband <b>threw</b> the bill of divorce <b>to her into her lap or into her basket [<i>kaltah</i>], this</b> woman <b>is divorced</b> even if she was in her husband’s domain at that time. By the same token, even if the buyer’s vessels are in the domain of the seller, they effect acquisition of the sold items on his behalf.
<b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>you resolved</b> Rav Sheshet’s dilemma <b>from that</b> mishna, <b>which</b> has already been <b>struck</b> with <b>one hundred strikes of a hammer [<i>uklei be’ukela</i>]?</b> In their analysis of this mishna, the Sages have already inserted so many qualifications that it cannot be understood in a straightforward manner.
<b>As Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: This</b> <i>halakha</i> of the mishna in <i>Gittin</i> applies only if <b>her basket was hanging from her</b> body, so that it is considered on her or in her hand. <b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> It is sufficient if <b>it</b> was <b>tied</b> to her, <b>even though it is not hanging from her,</b> but resting on the ground. <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where her basket was placed between her thighs.</b> Although it is not hanging from her, since it is placed on her body it serves to acquire the bill of divorce on her behalf. <b>Rav Mesharshiyya, son of Rabbi Ami, says:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where her husband</b> was <b>a basket seller.</b> Since he is not particular about the place where the basket into which he placed the bill of divorce is located, as his entire courtyard is full of baskets, it is considered as though he expressly granted her the right to make use of its location.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The place of her lap,</b> i.e., the place within her husband’s property where she stands or sits, <b>belongs to her,</b> and <b>the place of her basket is acquired to her. Rava said: What is the reason</b> behind the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan?</b> It is <b>because a person,</b> including a husband, <b>is not particular neither about the place of her lap nor about the place of her basket,</b> as she requires these areas and they do not take up much space. It is evident from all of these qualifications that one cannot infer a halakhic principle from here with regard to a buyer’s vessels in a seller’s domain.
<b>Rather, resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from that</b> which was taught in a <i>baraita</i>: If the merchandise was <b>in the domain of a seller,</b> the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> the merchandise <b>until he lifts</b> it <b>or until he removes it from the domain</b> of the seller. <b>What,</b> is it <b>not</b> referring to merchandise placed <b>in the vessels of the buyer,</b> which proves that the buyer’s vessels do not effect acquisition of the merchandise on his behalf when they are in the seller’s domain? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this does not serve as proof, as it is referring to merchandise placed <b>in the vessels of the seller.</b> That is why the buyer must lift or pull the merchandise to acquire it.
The Gemara asks: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the first clause</b> is referring <b>to the vessels of the seller,</b> as currently understood, <b>the latter clause</b> must <b>also</b> be referring <b>to the vessels of the seller. Say the latter clause:</b> If the merchandise was <b>in the domain of the buyer, once the seller accepts upon himself</b> to sell an item, <b>the buyer acquires</b> it. <b>And if</b> this is referring to merchandise <b>in the vessels of the seller,</b> as in the earlier clause, <b>why does the buyer acquire</b> it? The Gemara answers: In <b>the latter clause, we come to</b> a different scenario, which involves <b>the vessels of the buyer.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the clauses of the <i>baraita</i> are addressing different cases, <b>why</b> was it stated <b>without qualification?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The normal</b> way <b>of things</b> is that <b>in the house of the seller the vessels of the seller are</b> commonly <b>found, and in the house of the buyer the vessels of the buyer are</b> commonly <b>found.</b> In sum, the dilemma cannot be resolved from the <i>baraita</i>.
<b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one pulled his donkey drivers,</b> thereby dragging along with them the donkeys laden with goods, <b>and</b> likewise, if he pulled <b>his laborers,</b> who were carrying merchandise he wished to purchase, <b>and he brought them into his house, whether he fixed</b> a price <b>before he measured</b> the merchandise <b>or whether he measured before fixing</b> a price, <b>both</b> parties <b>can renege on</b> the sale, provided that the merchandise has not been unloaded from the laborers or the donkeys.

Daf 86a

But in a case where <b>he unloaded</b> the merchandise from them <b>and brought it into his house,</b> if <b>he fixed</b> a price <b>before he measured</b> the merchandise, <b>both</b> parties <b>are no</b> longer <b>able to renege on</b> the sale. If <b>he measured</b> the merchandise <b>before fixing</b> a price, <b>both of them are able to renege on</b> the sale. The Gemara comments: <b>And from</b> the fact <b>that the vessels of the seller</b> when <b>in the domain of</b> the <b>buyer do not effect acquisition</b> of the merchandise for the seller, i.e., they do not prevent the buyer from acquiring the merchandise, one can derive that <b>the vessels of the buyer in the domain of</b> the <b>seller do not effect acquisition</b> of the merchandise on his behalf <b>as well.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> The merchandise was not placed in the domain of the buyer in vessels belonging to the seller. Rather, the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where he emptied</b> the vessels onto the ground. Conversely, if the merchandise remains in the seller’s vessels, the buyer does not acquire it. <b>Rava became angry</b> with Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak at his rejection of Rava’s proof, and retorted: <b>Does</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach: He emptied them?</b> No; <b>it teaches: He unloaded them,</b> i.e., he kept the goods in vessels belonging to the seller. <b>Rather, Mar bar Rav Ashi says:</b> This proof can be rejected by means of a different interpretation, as the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> does not refer to vessels full of goods but is stated <b>with regard to bundles of garlic</b> that were tied together. Therefore, they are unloaded straight onto the floor in the buyer’s domain.
With regard to the matter itself, <b>Huna, son of Mar Zutra, said to Ravina: Since</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: He unloaded them,</b> which indicates that unloading the merchandise constitutes the act of acquisition, <b>what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if <b>he fixed</b> a price, <b>and what</b> difference is there <b>to me</b> if <b>he did not fix</b> a price? Ravina <b>said to him:</b> If <b>he fixed</b> a price <b>he has made up his mind</b> to sell, and therefore the transaction can take place. If <b>he did not fix</b> a price, <b>he has not made up his mind</b> to sell and the transaction does not occur. In any event, no convincing proof has been found with regard to the <i>halakha</i> in a case where the vessels of the buyer are in the domain of the seller.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution, <b>as Rav and Shmuel both say: A person’s vessel effects acquisition for him</b> of any item placed inside it, <b>in any place</b> that it is situated. <b>What is added</b> by the phrase: In any place? Does it <b>not</b> serve <b>to add</b> the <b>domain of the seller?</b> Rav Ashi answered: <b>There,</b> it is referring to a specific case, <b>where</b> the seller <b>said to him: Go</b> and <b>acquire</b> it. In that situation, the buyer does acquire the merchandise. This does not refer to a standard case where the buyer’s vessels are located in the domain of the seller.
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 26a): <b>Property that is guaranteed,</b> i.e., land, <b>is acquired by</b> means of <b>money, or by</b> means of <b>a bill, or by taking possession</b> of it. <b>And</b> property <b>that does not have a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, <b>can be acquired only by</b> means of <b>pulling. In Sura they taught this</b> following <b><i>halakha</i> in the name of Rav Ḥisda,</b> while <b>in Pumbedita they taught it in the name of Rav Kahana, and some say in the name of Rava: They taught</b> that movable property is acquired by means of pulling <b>only</b> with regard to <b>items that are not typically lifted</b> due to their weight or for some other reason. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>items that are typically lifted,</b> then <b>yes,</b> they are acquired <b>by</b> means of <b>lifting,</b> but they are <b>not</b> acquired <b>by</b> means of <b>pulling.</b>
<b>Abaye sat and related this <i>halakha</i>. Rav Adda bar Mattana raised an objection to Abaye</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One who steals a purse on Shabbat</b> is <b>liable</b> for theft. Based on the principle that one who is liable to receive two punishments receives only the greater of the two, in this case one might think that he should be exempt from paying for the theft, as the performance of a prohibited labor on Shabbat is punishable by death. The reason he is liable in this case, in apparent contradiction to that principle, is <b>that he already became liable for</b> the <b>theft</b> as soon as he lifted the purse. This occurred <b>before he came to</b> violate <b>the prohibition</b> of performing prohibited labor on <b>Shabbat</b> by carrying the purse into the public domain.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If he did not lift the purse but <b>was dragging</b> it on the ground <b>and exiting</b> the private domain, continuously <b>dragging and exiting,</b> he is <b>exempt, as the prohibition</b> of performing labor on <b>Shabbat and</b> the prohibition of <b>theft</b> are violated <b>simultaneously</b> the moment he drags the purse out of the owner’s property into the public domain. Therefore, he receives only the greater punishment, death, for carrying on Shabbat.
Rav Adda bar Mattana explains his objection: <b>But a purse is an item that can be lifted, and even so</b> it is apparent from the <i>baraita</i> that one <b>acquires</b> it <b>by</b> means of <b>pulling.</b> How then can it be stated that items that are typically lifted are not acquired by pulling? Abaye <b>said to him:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the thief pulled the purse <b>with a rope.</b> Rav Adda bar Mattana thought that Abaye meant that the thief happened to drag it with a rope, and he responded: <b>I also state</b> my question even in a case where he pulled the purse <b>with a rope,</b> as it is still evident that one can acquire the purse by means of pulling instead of lifting. Abaye <b>said to him:</b> I meant that the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>an item that requires a rope.</b> It is a purse that is so large that it cannot be lifted and must be pulled, therefore it is acquired by means of pulling.
The Gemara raises another objection. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear:</b> If the merchandise is <b>in the domain of</b> the <b>seller,</b> the buyer <b>does not acquire</b> the merchandise <b>until he lifts it or until he removes it from the domain</b> of the seller. <b>Apparently,</b> with regard to <b>an item that can be lifted, if he</b> so <b>desires he acquires it by lifting, and if he</b> so <b>desires he acquires it by pulling. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> This is not a proof, as it can be explained that the <i>tanna</i> <b>teaches it disjunctively,</b> i.e., the two options are referring to two different cases: In the case of <b>an item that can be lifted,</b> he acquires it <b>by lifting,</b> whereas with regard to regard to <b>an item that can be pulled,</b> he acquires it <b>by pulling.</b>

Daf 86b

The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna (84b) that even items that are usually lifted can be acquired by means of pulling: With regard to <b>one who sells produce to another,</b> if the buyer <b>pulled</b> the produce <b>but did not measure</b> it, <b>he has acquired</b> it. The Gemara explains the proof: <b>But produce can be lifted, and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches that it is acquired by</b> means of <b>pulling.</b>
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing <b>with large bundles</b> that are pulled from place to place and are not carried, due to their size. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>One who buys flax from another has not acquired</b> it <b>until he carries it from this place to another place,</b> i.e., it is acquired only though lifting and not through pulling. <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>flax is not prepared in large bundles?</b> The Gemara answers: Yes, <b>flax is different.</b> Unlike other produce, flax is not packed in large bundles, <b>as it</b> would <b>slip</b> from its place. Rather, it is packed in small bundles, and therefore flax is acquired specifically through lifting.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 25b): <b>Large domesticated animals are acquired through passing</b> the animal’s leash to the buyer, <b>and small</b> domesticated animals are acquired <b>through lifting;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar. And the Rabbis say: Small domesticated animals</b> are acquired <b>through pulling.</b> Ravina explains the proof: <b>But small domesticated animals are</b> creatures <b>that can be lifted, and</b> yet the mishna <b>teaches that</b> one <b>acquires</b> them <b>through pulling.</b> Rav Ashi rejected this proof: <b>Domesticated animals are different, as they cling</b> to the ground and it is difficult to lift them. Therefore, the usual manner of moving animals is to pull them.
§ The Gemara cites another case with regard to sales. <b>Rav and Shmuel both say:</b> If a seller said to a buyer: <b>I am selling you one <i>kor</i>,</b> a measure equivalent to thirty <i>se’a</i>, of grain <b>for</b> the price of <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, the seller <b>can renege on</b> the sale as long as the measuring vessel is not filled, <b>even when</b> only <b>the last <i>se’a</i></b> has yet to be measured, because he had agreed to sell only a complete <i>kor</i>. By contrast, if the seller said: <b>I am selling you one <i>kor</i> for thirty</b> <i>sela</i> and each <b><i>se’a</i></b> is sold <b>for one <i>sela</i>,</b> he cannot completely renege on the sale in the middle of the transaction. This is because the buyer <b>acquires</b> each <i>se’a</i> <b>one</b> by <b>one</b> as it is measured, since the seller sold each <i>se’a</i> individually.
The Gemara raises a difficulty from the <i>baraita</i> cited on 85a. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: If the measuring</b> vessel <b>belonged to one of them,</b> the buyer <b>acquires</b> the items of sale <b>one</b> by <b>one. And</b> since this <i>halakha</i> is stated in general terms, it indicates that the buyer acquires each item as it is placed in the measuring vessel, <b>even though the measuring</b> vessel <b>was not filled.</b>
The Gemara answers: The <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>said to him: I am selling you one <i>hin</i>,</b> a liquid measure equivalent to twelve <i>log</i>, <b>for twelve <i>sela</i>,</b> each <b><i>log</i> for one <i>sela</i>. And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> an observation <b>that Rav Kahana says:</b> In the Temple <b>there were markings on the</b> vessel that measured <b><i>hin</i>,</b> with which one could measure the different libations. <b>Here too, there were markings on the measuring</b> vessels, and since the measuring vessel indicates at which point each <i>log</i> had been filled, the buyer acquires it. This is comparable to the case of one who sells each <i>se’a</i> individually.
The Gemara raises another difficulty. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear: One who hires a laborer</b> in the winter or the spring <b>to work for him in the harvest, for</b> one <b>dinar a day,</b>

Daf 87a

<b>and</b> a day of a laborer’s work during the <b>harvest is worth a <i>sela</i>,</b> the equivalent of four silver dinars, for each day, it is <b>prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit from him,</b> i.e., one may not employ the laborer under these conditions. The reason is that this is akin to taking interest, as the laborer works and receives less than he is entitled to in exchange for early payment. <b>But if one hires him</b> already <b>from now</b> to work <b>for</b> one <b>dinar a day</b> for an extended period of time, including the harvest season, <b>and</b> the work of a laborer during the <b>harvest is worth a <i>sela</i>,</b> this is <b>permitted.</b>
<b>And if it enters your mind,</b> as Rav and Shmuel claim, that if a seller said: <b>I am selling you one <i>kor</i> for thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, each <b><i>se’a</i> for one <i>sela</i>,</b> he cannot fully renege on the sale in the middle of the transaction, as the buyer <b>acquires</b> each <i>se’a</i> <b>one</b> by <b>one</b> as it is measured, then the <i>halakha</i> in this case should be different. <b>Here too,</b> as he does not agree to one large sum but <b>fixes</b> a price for each day, <b>one</b> by <b>one,</b> it is akin to taking interest, as the laborer works and receives less than he is entitled to in exchange for early payment. <b>And</b> therefore, it should be <b>prohibited to</b> derive <b>benefit from him.</b> Whereas the <i>baraita</i> states: If one hires him from now to work <b>for</b> one <b>dinar a day</b> over an extended period of time, including the harvest, <b>and</b> one day of a laborer’s work during the <b>harvest</b> is <b>worth one <i>sela</i>,</b> this is <b>permitted. Why</b> is it permitted? <b>But isn’t it payment for waiting,</b> i.e., for advancing the money to the laborer?
<b>Rava said: And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> the <i>baraita</i> in that manner? <b>Is it prohibited</b> for one <b>to lower</b> his <b>hiring</b> price and receive lower wages in order to ensure that he is employed? This arrangement is not a form of interest and violates no prohibition. The Gemara asks: If this is not considered taking interest, then <b>what is different</b> in <b>the first clause,</b> where the laborer is not employed immediately and this arrangement is prohibited, <b>and what is different</b> in <b>the latter clause,</b> where it is permitted?
The Gemara explains: In <b>the first clause, as</b> the laborer <b>does not work with him from now, it has the appearance of payment for waiting,</b> i.e., advancing the money to the laborer. In <b>the latter clause, as</b> the laborer <b>works with him from now, it does not have the appearance of payment for waiting.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And if</b> the flax <b>was attached to the ground and he detached any amount,</b> he has <b>acquired</b> it. The Gemara asks: Is it correct to say that <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that he detached any amount,</b> he <b>acquired</b> it? If he does not perform an act of acquisition with all of the flax, how can he acquire all of it? <b>Rav Sheshet said: Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>said to him: Go</b> and <b>clear for yourself any amount of land, and</b> thereby <b>acquire everything that is on it.</b> When the buyer clears the land by detaching the flax from the ground, he is considered to be renting the land and thereby acquires all the flax that grows on it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who sells</b> food or drink that has an established price, such as <b>wine and oil, to another, and</b> the price <b>rises or falls</b> and the buyer or the seller wishes to renege on the sale, <b>if</b> the price changed <b>before the measuring</b> vessel <b>is filled,</b> the merchandise still belongs <b>to the seller</b> and he can cancel the sale. <b>Once the measuring</b> vessel <b>is filled</b> the merchandise belongs <b>to the buyer,</b> and the seller can no longer cancel the sale. <b>And if there was a middleman [<i>sarsur</i>] between them</b> and <b>the barrel</b> belonging to the middleman, being used to measure the merchandise, <b>broke</b> during the transaction and the merchandise is ruined, <b>it broke for the middleman,</b> i.e., he is responsible for the ruined merchandise.
The mishna teaches an additional <i>halakha</i> with regard to sales: <b>And</b> anyone who sells wine, oil, or similar liquids is <b>obligated,</b> after he transfers the liquid into the buyer’s vessel, <b>to drip for him three</b> extra <b>drops</b> from the measure. After he drips those three drops, if <b>he turned</b> the barrel on its side <b>and drained</b> out the last bits of liquid that it contained, this <b>belongs to the seller</b> and he is not required to give these last drops to the buyer. <b>And a storekeeper is not obligated to drip three drops,</b> because he is too busy to do this constantly. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> If the sale occurs on <b>Shabbat eve as nightfall</b> arrives, one is <b>exempt</b> from dripping these three drops, as there is a need to complete the transaction before Shabbat begins.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara clarifies the mishna’s statement that the sale occurs once the measuring vessel is filled. <b>This measuring</b> vessel, <b>to whom</b> does it belong? <b>If we say</b> that the <b>measuring</b> vessel belongs <b>to the buyer,</b> why does the mishna teach that <b>before the measuring</b> vessel <b>is filled</b> the merchandise still belongs <b>to the seller?</b> Since <b>it is the measuring</b> vessel <b>of the buyer,</b> he should acquire everything that is placed in his vessel, whether or not it is filled. <b>But</b> if we say that the <b>measuring</b> vessel belongs <b>to the seller,</b> why does the mishna teach that <b>once the measuring</b> vessel <b>is filled</b> the merchandise belongs <b>to the buyer?</b> Since <b>it is the measuring</b> vessel <b>of the seller,</b> the merchandise has yet to enter the possession of the buyer.
<b>Rabbi Ela says:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where the measuring</b> vessel belongs to the <b>middleman.</b> The middleman lends it to the seller, and once it is filled it is loaned to the buyer so that he can transfer its contents into his vessels. The Gemara asks: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause teaches: And if there was a middleman between them</b> and <b>the barrel broke, it broke for the middleman, it may be inferred that</b> in <b>the first clause we are not dealing with a middleman.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The first clause</b> addresses <b>a measuring</b> vessel belonging to a middleman <b>without</b> the presence of the <b>middleman</b> at the transaction, whereas <b>the latter clause</b> is concerned <b>with a middleman himself,</b> who is present at the sale and therefore accepts responsibility for the barrel and its contents.
§ The mishna teaches that if <b>he turned</b> the barrel on its side <b>and drained</b> out the last bits of liquid within it, this liquid <b>belongs to the seller.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>When Rabbi Elazar ascended</b> from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he found Ze’eiri</b> and <b>said to him: Who here</b> is <b>the <i>tanna</i> to whom Rav taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>measures?</b> Ze’eiri <b>showed him Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi.</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>What</b> is it about this <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> poses <b>a difficulty for you?</b> Rabbi Elazar said to him that the problem is <b>that we learned</b> in the mishna: If <b>he turned</b> the barrel on its side <b>and drained</b> out the last bits of liquid within it, that liquid <b>belongs to the seller.</b>

Daf 87b

<b>But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Terumot</i> 11:8): If one poured oil or wine of <i>teruma</i> from one vessel to another and <b>turned</b> the vessel on its side <b>and drained</b> out the last bits of liquid inside, <b>this is <i>teruma</i></b> and must be given to the priest? This indicates that the last remnants of the liquid in the vessel belong to the one who receives the oil or wine, not the owner, i.e., the seller. Why, then, does the mishna here teach that the last remnants belong to the seller?
Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi <b>said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: <b>But wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna that <b>Rabbi Abbahu says: Due to</b> of the <b>despair</b> of the <b>owner,</b> who relinquishes his right to such a small amount of wine or oil, the Sages <b>touched upon it</b> and ruled that any remnants extracted from the vessel belong to the seller? By contrast, with regard to <i>teruma</i>, which is forbidden to non-priests, the despair of the buyer is irrelevant, and therefore anything that remains in the vessels is <i>teruma</i>.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And a storekeeper is not obligated to drip</b> three drops. Rabbi Yehuda says: If the sale occurs on Shabbat eve as nightfall arrives, one is exempt from dripping these three drops. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is <b>Rabbi Yehuda referring to the first clause</b> of the mishna, <b>and</b> if so his ruling <b>is lenient,</b> as the mishna states that one must drip three drops and he states that on Shabbat eve one is exempt from doing so? <b>Or perhaps he is referring to the latter clause and is stringent,</b> as the mishna teaches that a storekeeper is always exempt, whereas Rabbi Yehuda rules that this is the <i>halakha</i> only on Shabbat eve?
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of this dilemma, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says: On Shabbat eve at nightfall a storekeeper is exempt because</b> the <b>storekeeper is busy.</b> This proves that Rabbi Yehuda was referring to the latter clause of the mishna, i.e., he exempts the storekeeper from dripping the drops only on Shabbat eve.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who sends his son to a storekeeper with a <i>pundeyon</i>,</b> a coin worth two <i>issar</i>, <b>in his hand, and</b> the storekeeper <b>measured oil for him for</b> one <b><i>issar</i> and gave him the</b> second <b><i>issar</i></b> as change, and the son <b>broke the jug and lost the <i>issar</i>, the storekeeper</b> must compensate the father, as he gave the jug and coin to one who is not halakhically competent. <b>Rabbi Yehuda exempts</b> him from liability, <b>as</b> he holds that the father <b>sent</b> his son <b>in order to</b> do <b>this,</b> i.e., to bring back the jug and coin. <b>And the Rabbis concede to Rabbi Yehuda</b> with regard to a case <b>when the jug is in the hand of the child and</b> the <b>storekeeper measured</b> the oil <b>into it that</b> the <b>storekeeper</b> is <b>exempt</b> if the child breaks the jug.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Granted, with regard to</b> the <b><i>issar</i> and</b> the <b>oil,</b> one can explain that <b>they disagree over this</b> matter: <b>As the Rabbis hold</b> that the father <b>sent</b> his son <b>to inform</b> the storekeeper that he needed oil but did not intend for the storekeeper to send the oil with the boy. For this reason, if the storekeeper gave the child the oil he is liable for its loss. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>he sent</b> his son so that the storekeeper would <b>send him</b> back with the oil, and therefore the storekeeper is exempt from liability. <b>But</b> if the child <b>broke the jug,</b> why do the Rabbis hold that the storekeeper is responsible for it? <b>It is a deliberate loss</b> on the part of the father, as he entrusted the jug to his young son, who is not responsible enough to care for it.
<b>Rav Hoshaya said: Here we are dealing with a proprietor who sells jugs,</b> and the father sent his son with a jug in case the store owner might want to buy it. <b>And</b> this is a case <b>where the storekeeper took</b> the jug <b>in order to examine it, and</b> the ruling is <b>in accordance with</b> a statement <b>of Shmuel. As Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>one who takes a vessel from a craftsman in order to examine it</b> and buy it if he chooses, <b>and an accident occurred</b> while it was <b>in his possession</b> and it broke, he is <b>liable</b> to pay restitution for the vessel. He has the halakhic status of a borrower, and therefore he bears financial responsibility for the loss.
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that the opinion <b>of Shmuel is</b> subject to a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>?</b> Since Rabbi Yehuda disagrees with the Rabbis, his opinion evidently differs from that of Shmuel. <b>Rather, Rabba and Rav Yosef both say</b> that the disagreement in the mishna should be explained as follows: <b>Here, we are dealing with a storekeeper who sells jugs,</b> and the father sent his son to buy from him a jug filled with oil. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda follows his</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> as explained above, that the father sent his son to bring back the merchandise, <b>and the Rabbis</b> follow <b>their</b> line of <b>reasoning,</b> that the father sent the son to inform the storekeeper what he needed, but not to carry it back.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, say the last clause: The Rabbis concede to Rabbi Yehuda</b> in a case <b>when the jug was in the hand of the child, and the storekeeper measured</b> the oil <b>into it, that the storekeeper</b> is <b>exempt.</b> Why would the Rabbis rule that the storekeeper is exempt? <b>But you said</b> that the father <b>sent</b> his son only <b>to inform</b> the storekeeper of his order, but he did not intend for the storekeeper to give anything to his son. <b>Rather, Abaye bar Avin and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Avin both say</b> that the disagreement in the mishna should be explained as follows: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b>

Daf 88a

The mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the storekeeper <b>took</b> the jug from the child in order <b>to measure with it</b> for him, <b>and</b> because he took it in his hands, he is liable in the event of an accident, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabba. As Rabba says:</b> With regard to the obligation to return lost animals, even in a case where the finder is exempt from caring for the animal and returning it to its owner, e.g., if he is an elderly person and it is beneath his dignity, if <b>he struck</b> the animal in order to lead it, then <b>he becomes obligated</b> to return <b>it.</b> Likewise, the Rabbis here maintain that the storekeeper’s action renders him liable for the jug.
The Gemara asks: You can <b>say that Rabba says</b> his statement <b>with regard to animals, as</b> the finder <b>taught them</b> to <b>take steps away,</b> i.e., he worsened the situation, as he causes them to stray even further from their owner. Nevertheless, in <b>a case like this,</b> where the storekeeper took the jug from the child, <b>did</b> Rabba <b>say</b> that the storekeeper is liable? The storekeeper’s action does not make it any more likely that the jug will break.
<b>Rather, Rava said: I and the lion of the group explained it. And who is</b> this great Sage, referred to as a lion? It is <b>Rabbi Zeira,</b> and the explanation is as follows: <b>Here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the storekeeper <b>took</b> the jug from the child in order <b>to measure with it for others,</b> without the knowledge of the father.
<b>And</b> the Rabbis and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree with regard to a borrower</b> who takes an item <b>without</b> the owner’s <b>knowledge.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that the storekeeper <b>is</b> considered like any other <b>borrower</b> and once he returns the jug to the child, he is no longer responsible for it. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that someone who borrows without the owner’s knowledge <b>is a robber</b> and is obligated to return the item to its owner. Therefore, the storekeeper must pay for the jug that the child broke before it reached the father.
The Gemara returns to <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>one who takes a vessel from a craftsman</b> in order <b>to examine it, and an accident occurred</b> while it was <b>in his possession</b> and it broke, he is <b>liable</b> to pay restitution for the vessel. The Gemara explains: <b>And this statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where the monetary</b> value of the vessel <b>is fixed,</b> because he examines the vessel merely to ensure there is nothing wrong with it, and it is assumed that if he finds no defect he will buy it.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain man who entered a butcher shop and lifted a thigh of meat</b> to examine it. <b>While he was lifting it, a horseman came</b> and <b>seized</b> it <b>from him.</b> The buyer <b>came before Rav Yeimar,</b> who <b>deemed him liable to pay its monetary</b> value to the seller, because it was seized from him after he had lifted it. The Gemara again notes: <b>And this matter,</b> i.e., <i>halakha</i>, applies only in a place <b>where the monetary</b> value of the item is <b>fixed,</b> and therefore lifting it is equivalent to finalizing the sale.
The Gemara relates a similar incident: There was <b>a certain man who brought pumpkins to</b> the city of <b>Pum Nahara. Everyone came</b> and <b>took a pumpkin</b> with the intention of buying it, but had yet to pay for it. The seller was angry, and since he did not know from whom to demand payment, <b>he said to them:</b> The pumpkins <b>are hereby consecrated to Heaven.</b>
<b>They came before Rav Kahana</b> to inquire about the halakhic status of the pumpkins. Rav Kahana <b>said to them:</b> This statement has no effect, as <b>a person cannot consecrate an item that is not his,</b> and since the buyers had lifted the pumpkins, they no longer belonged to the seller. Once again the Gemara points out: <b>And this matter,</b> i.e., <i>halakha</i>, applies only in a place <b>where</b> the item’s <b>monetary</b> value is <b>fixed,</b> and therefore lifting it is akin to finalizing the sale. <b>But</b> if the item’s <b>monetary</b> value is <b>not fixed, it remains in the jurisdiction of its owner, and</b> the seller <b>did well,</b> i.e., was successful, in <b>that he consecrated</b> it.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> In the case of <b>one who</b> wishes to <b>buy vegetables from the market</b> and the seller is an <i>am ha’aretz</i>, i.e., one who is unreliable with regard to tithes, in which case the buyer is required to separate tithes after his purchase, <b>and he selected</b> superior-quality vegetables from inferior-quality vegetables <b>and placed</b> them to the side, as he was considering purchasing them, <b>even</b> if he did this <b>all day,</b> if he does not decide to buy the vegetables <b>he does not acquire</b> them <b>and does not become obligated in</b> separating <b>tithes.</b>
If <b>he had determined to buy</b> the vegetables he selected, <b>he acquires</b> them <b>and becomes obligated in</b> separating <b>tithes.</b> In such a case, <b>it is not possible</b> for him to decide to not buy the vegetables and <b>to return</b> them to the seller in their present state, <b>as they have already became obligated in tithes, and,</b> likewise, <b>it is not possible to tithe them</b> and return them to the seller, <b>as he would then lower their monetary</b> value. <b>How</b> should he proceed? <b>He</b> should <b>tithe</b> the produce, give the tithes to an appropriate recipient, <b>and give</b> the seller <b>money</b> in exchange for the <b>tithes</b> that he separated from it.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that to say</b> that <b>because one determined to buy</b> the produce, even though he says nothing and performs no act of acquisition, <b>he acquires</b> the produce <b>and becomes obligated in tithes? Rav Hoshaya said: Here, we are dealing with</b> a buyer who is <b>God-fearing, such as Rav Safra,</b> who <b>himself fulfilled</b> the verse: <b>“And speaks truth in his heart”</b> (Psalms 15:2). With regard to business matters Rav Safra considered himself bound by his thoughts at the time of negotiations, even if he did not express them verbally or perform any action (see <i>Makkot</i> 24a). A person on the ethical level of Rav Safra acquires the produce and becomes obligated to separate tithes from the moment that he decides to buy it.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A wholesaler [<i>hassiton</i>] must clean his measuring</b> vessels, which are used for measuring liquids such as oil and wine, <b>once every thirty days,</b> because the residue of the liquids sticks to the measure and reduces its capacity. <b>And a homeowner</b> who sells his goods must clean his measuring vessels only <b>once every twelve months. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The matters are reversed.</b> In the case of one who is constantly using his vessels for selling merchandise the residue does not adhere to the measuring vessel, and therefore a wholesaler must clean his measures only once a year. But in the case of a homeowner, who does not sell as often, the residue adheres to the measuring vessel; therefore, he must clean them every thirty days.
<b>A storekeeper,</b> who constantly sells merchandise in small quantities, <b>cleans his measuring</b> vessels <b>twice a week and cleans his weights once a week; and he cleans</b> the pans of <b>his scales after each and every weighing,</b> to ensure that no merchandise has adhered to the pans, thereby increasing their weight. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: In what</b> case <b>is this statement,</b> that it is necessary to clean a measuring vessel, <b>said? With regard to moist</b> items, which are likely to adhere to the measuring vessels. <b>But with regard to dry</b> goods, which do not adhere to the measuring vessels, one <b>does not need</b> to clean his measuring vessels.

Daf 88b

<b>And</b> before adding the weights and merchandise the seller is <b>obligated to let</b> the pans of the scale that will hold the merchandise <b>tilt</b> an extra <b>handbreadth for</b> the buyer by adding a weight to that side. If the seller <b>weighed for him exactly,</b> i.e., with the scales equally balanced initially, instead of allowing the scales to tilt an extra handbreadth, <b>he must give</b> the buyer <b>additional amounts [<i>geirumin</i>],</b> an additional <b>one-tenth in</b> the case of <b>liquids</b> sold by weight, <b>and</b> an additional <b>one-twentieth in</b> the case of <b>dry</b> goods.
The mishna continues to discuss the correct method of weighing: In <b>a place where they were accustomed to measure</b> merchandise in several stages <b>with a small</b> measuring vessel, <b>one may not measure</b> all the items at once <b>with</b> a single <b>large</b> measuring vessel. In a place where they measure <b>with</b> one <b>large</b> measuring vessel, <b>one may not measure with</b> several <b>small</b> measuring vessels. In a place where the custom is <b>to level</b> the top of the measuring vessel to remove substances heaped above its edges, <b>one may not heap</b> it, and where the custom is <b>to heap</b> it, <b>one may not level</b> it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters,</b> that the seller must initially let the scales tilt an extra handbreadth, <b>derived? Reish Lakish said:</b> The source is <b>that the verse states</b> that one should have: <b>“A perfect and just [<i>tzedek</i>] weight”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:15), which is interpreted as an instruction to the seller: <b>Be righteous [<i>tzaddek</i>] with that which is yours and give it to</b> the buyer. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so, say the latter clause:</b> If the seller <b>weighed for him exactly, he gives</b> the buyer <b>additional amounts. But if letting</b> the scales <b>tilt</b> is obligatory <b>by Torah law, how can he</b> originally <b>give him</b> by weighing <b>exactly?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> it is not obligatory to let the scales tilt, and <b>the first clause</b> is referring <b>to a place where they are accustomed</b> to let the scales tilt an extra handbreadth. <b>And if</b> the statement <b>of Reish Lakish was stated,</b> it <b>was stated with regard to the latter clause:</b> If the seller <b>weighed for him exactly, he gives</b> the buyer <b>additional amounts. From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Reish Lakish said</b> that this is <b>as the verse states: “And just [<i>tzedek</i>],”</b> which indicates: <b>Be righteous [<i>tzaddek</i>] with that which is yours and give it to</b> the buyer. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> are the <b>additional amounts</b> that are given? <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel says</b> that <b>Rav says: In</b> the case of <b>liquids, one-tenth of a <i>litra</i> for</b> every <b>ten <i>litra</i>,</b> i.e., one-hundredth.
The mishna teaches that the seller adds <b>one-tenth in</b> the case of <b>liquids, and one-twentieth for dry</b> goods. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>what</b> case <b>is</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>speaking?</b> Does he mean <b>one-tenth in</b> the case of <b>liquids for</b> every <b>ten</b> units <b>of liquid, and</b> similarly <b>one-twentieth in</b> the case of <b>dry</b> goods <b>for</b> every <b>twenty</b> units <b>of dry</b> goods, i.e., one four-hundredth? <b>Or perhaps,</b> he means <b>one-tenth for</b> every <b>ten</b> units <b>of liquid, and</b> similarly one-tenth <b>for</b> every <b>twenty</b> units <b>of dry</b> goods, i.e., one two- hundredth? The Gemara states that the dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ <b>Rabbi Levi says: The punishment for</b> using false <b>measures is more severe than the punishment for</b> transgressing the prohibition of <b>forbidden sexual relations. As</b> in <b>that</b> case, forbidden relations, it <b>is stated with regard to them</b> a shortened term for the word “these”: <b>“<i>El</i>,”</b> in the verse: “For all these [<i>el</i> ] abominations” (Leviticus 18:27). <b>And</b> in <b>this</b> case, false measures, it <b>is stated</b> an expanded term for the word “these”: <b>“<i>Elleh</i>,”</b> in the verse: “For all that do these [<i>elleh</i>] things, even all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto the Lord your God” (Deuteronomy 25:16). <b>And from where may it be inferred that this</b> expression <b>“<i>el</i>”</b> indicates that the prohibition <b>is severe,</b> based on which it is understood that the form this word takes indicates a level of severity? <b>As it is written: “And the mighty [<i>eilei</i>] of the land he took away”</b> (Ezekiel 17:13).
The Gemara asks: <b>But with regard to forbidden relations isn’t it also written:</b> “For whosoever shall do any of <b>these [<i>elleh</i>]</b> abominations” (Leviticus 18:29)? If so, why is the punishment for using false measures considered harsher? The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> expression of “<i>elleh</i>” (Leviticus 18:29) in the context of forbidden relations does not serve to emphasize its severity. Rather, it serves <b>to exclude</b> one who uses deception in <b>measures from</b> the penalty of <b>excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>].</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if the punishment is in fact less severe, <b>what is the advantage,</b> i.e., the greater severity, in the case of false measures? The Gemara answers <b>that there,</b> in the case of one who engages in forbidden relations, <b>he has the possibility of repentance. But here,</b> in the case of one who uses false measures, <b>there is no possibility of repentance</b> because he has no way of knowing whom he cheated, and is therefore unable to return the stolen money.
<b>And Rabbi Levi says: Robbing an ordinary</b> person <b>is more severe than robbing the Most High,</b> i.e., taking consecrated property. <b>As</b> with regard to <b>this</b> regular robber, the verse states <b>“sin” before “<i>me’ila</i>”:</b> “If any one sin, and commit a trespass [<i>me’ila</i>] against the Lord, and deal falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit, or of pledge, or of robbery, or have oppressed his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that</b> one who misuses consecrated items, the verse states <b><i>me’ila</i> before sin:</b> “If any one engages in misuse [<i>timol ma’al</i>] and sins unwittingly” (Leviticus 5:15).
<b>And Rabbi Levi says: Come and see that the attribute of flesh and blood is unlike the attribute of the Holy One, Blessed be He. The Holy One, Blessed be He, blessed the Jewish people with twenty-two, and cursed them with</b> only <b>eight.</b> Rabbi Levi explains: <b>He blessed them with</b> the <b>twenty-two</b> letters of the Hebrew alphabet, <b>from</b> the first letter, <i>alef</i>, that begins the verse: <b>“If [<i>im</i>] you</b> walk <b>in My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 26:3), <b>until “upright [<i>komemiyyut</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 26:13), which ends with the letter <i>tav</i>, the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet.
<b>And He cursed them with eight</b> letters, <b>from</b> the letter <i>vav</i> that begins the verse: <b>“And if [<i>ve’im</i>] you shall reject My statutes”</b> (Leviticus 26:15), <b>until: “And My statutes were abhorred by their soul [<i>nafsham</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 26:43), which ends with the letter <i>mem</i>. There are eight letters in the Hebrew alphabet from the letter <i>vav</i> to the letter <i>mem</i>, inclusive.
<b>And yet Moses, our teacher,</b> who is flesh and blood, <b>blessed them with eight</b> letters, <b>and cursed them with twenty-two. He blessed them with eight</b> letters,

Daf 89a

<b>from</b> the letter <i>vav</i> that begins the verse: <b>“And it shall come to pass [<i>vehaya</i>], if you shall hearken diligently”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:1), <b>until: “To serve them [<i>le’ovdam</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:14), which ends with the letter <i>mem</i>. <b>And he cursed them with twenty-two</b> letters, <b>from</b> the letter <i>vav</i> that begins the verse: <b>“But it shall come to pass [<i>vehaya</i>], if you will not hearken</b> to the voice of the Lord” (Deuteronomy 28:15), <b>until: “And no man shall buy [<i>koneh</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 28:68). This verse ends with a letter <i>heh</i>, which comes just before <i>vav</i> in the alphabet. Starting with a <i>vav</i> and ending with a <i>heh</i> encompasses the twenty-two letters of the alphabet.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>in a place where they were accustomed to measure with</b> one <b>large</b> measuring vessel, one may not measure with several small measuring vessels. In a place where the custom is to level the top of the measuring vessel to remove substances heaped above its edges, one may not heap it; and where they are accustomed to heap it, one may not level it. The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the ensuing <i>halakhot</i>: <b>One may not balance with precision; and one may not heap</b> it; <b>with market inspectors [<i>ba’agardamin</i>]; and with a <i>litra</i>; three; and ten; fulcrum; weights; a thick leveler; you may not do; one may not do.</b>
<b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not level</b> a measuring vessel <b>in a place where they</b> are accustomed to <b>heap</b> it <b>and</b> that <b>one may not heap</b> it <b>in a place where they</b> are accustomed to <b>level</b> it? <b>The verse states: “A perfect weight”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:15), which indicates that one must use whatever is considered a perfect measuring vessel in that locale, as this ensures that there is no deception or trickery.
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> the seller <b>said in a place where they heap: I am hereby leveling and</b> am willing in exchange <b>to reduce the price for</b> you, or said, <b>in a place where they level: I am hereby heaping and</b> am willing <b>to increase the price for</b> you, <b>that</b> the court <b>does not listen to him? The verse states: “A perfect and just weight you shall have”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:15). The addition of the term “just,” beyond the requirement that the weight be “perfect,” teaches that one must keep his weights in a just manner, i.e., that employed by the people of that locale.
<b>The Sages taught: From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may not</b> balance a scale so that it will <b>balance with precision [<i>me’ayyenin</i>] in a place where they</b> are accustomed to <b>let</b> the scales <b>tilt</b> a handbreadth for the benefit of the buyer, <b>and</b> that <b>one may not let</b> the scales <b>tilt</b> a handbreadth <b>in a place where they</b> are accustomed to <b>balance with precision? The verse states: “A perfect weight”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:15), which teaches that the weight must be considered perfect in that locale.
<b>And from where</b> is it derived <b>that if</b> a seller <b>said, in a place where</b> it is the custom to <b>let</b> the scales <b>tilt</b> a handbreadth: <b>I am hereby balancing with precision and</b> am willing <b>to reduce the price for</b> the buyer; <b>or, in a place where</b> it is the custom to <b>balance with precision: I am hereby letting</b> the scales <b>tilt</b> a handbreadth <b>and</b> am willing <b>to increase the price for</b> the buyer, <b>that</b> the court <b>does not listen to him? The verse states: “A perfect and just weight”</b> (Deuteronomy 25:15), which teaches that the just way of acting is to weigh in accordance with the practice in that locale.
<b>Rav Yehuda of Sura says</b> a homiletic interpretation of the phrase: “You shall not have in your house diverse measures” (Deuteronomy 25:14): <b>“You shall not have in your house”</b> means that you will become a pauper, who has nothing in his house. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>due to</b> the fact that you used <b>diverse measures,</b> buying with a large vessel and selling with a small one.
The phrase: “You shall not have in your purse diverse weights” (Deuteronomy 25:13), is interpreted in a similar fashion: <b>“You shall not have in your purse,”</b> i.e., you will become a pauper, who has nothing in his purse. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is <b>due to</b> the fact that you used <b>diverse weights. But</b> if you possess only <b>“a perfect and just weight,”</b> then <b>“you shall have”</b> wealth. Likewise, if you possess only <b>“a perfect and just measure,”</b> then <b>“you shall have”</b> wealth.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> that the phrase: <b>“You shall not have,” teaches that</b> the court <b>appoints market inspectors to</b> supervise the accuracy of <b>measures.</b> The Gemara infers: <b>But</b> the court <b>does not appoint market inspectors for</b> supervising market <b>prices.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>The house of the <i>Nasi</i> appointed market inspectors for</b> supervising <b>both measures and prices. Shmuel said to</b> his student, the Sage <b>Karna: Go out</b> and <b>teach them</b> that <b>one appoints market inspectors for</b> supervising <b>measures but one does not appoint market inspectors for prices.</b>
Karna <b>went out</b> and <b>taught them</b> that <b>one appoints market inspectors for</b> supervising <b>both measures and prices.</b> Shmuel, hearing what he had done, <b>said to him: What is your name?</b> He replied: <b>Karna.</b> Shmuel said: <b>Let a horn [<i>karna</i>] emerge in his eye. A horn,</b> i.e., a growth of flesh, <b>emerged in his eye.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> Karna, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>did he hold,</b> which led him to disregard his teacher’s statement? He held <b>in accordance with that which Rami bar Ḥama says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: One appoints market inspectors for</b> supervising <b>both measures and prices, due to swindlers,</b> to prevent people from using smaller measures or from selling at a steep price while falsely claiming that they are selling superior-quality merchandise.
The Gemara discusses several <i>halakhot</i> related to the cases of the mishna. <b>The Sages taught:</b> If the buyer <b>requested from</b> the seller <b>a <i>litra</i></b> of a specific item, <b>he weighs for him</b> using <b>a <i>litra</i></b> weight. If he asks for <b>half a <i>litra</i>, he weighs for him using a half-<i>litra</i></b> weight. If he wants <b>one-quarter</b> of <b>a <i>litra</i>, he weighs for him</b> using <b>a quarter</b>-<b><i>litra</i></b> weight. The Gemara asks: Isn’t this obvious? <b>What is</b> this <i>baraita</i> <b>teaching us?</b> The Gemara explains: It teaches <b>that one sets weights until this</b> amount, one-quarter of a <i>litra</i>, but not less. If a buyer asks the seller to weigh a smaller amount for him, his request is not granted.
Furthermore, <b>the Sages taught:</b> If the buyer <b>requested from him three-quarters</b> of <b>a <i>litra</i>,</b> and there is no weight equal to this amount, the buyer <b>may not say to him: Weigh for me three</b> units using <b>a quarter-<i>litra</i></b> weight, <b>one</b> by <b>one,</b> so that the seller lets the scales tilt by a handbreadth as he measures each quarter-<i>litra</i> weight. <b>Rather, he weighs</b> the merchandise all at once, as he places <b>a <i>litra</i></b> weight on one pan of the scale, and <b>places</b> on the other pan of the scale <b>a quarter-<i>litra</i> weight</b> together <b>with the meat</b> that is being sold.
<b>The Sages</b> likewise <b>taught:</b> In a case where the buyer <b>requested from</b> the seller <b>ten <i>litra</i></b> of merchandise, the buyer <b>may not say to him: Weigh for me</b> each <i>litra</i> <b>one</b> by <b>one, and let</b> the scales <b>tilt</b> each time, as on every occasion that the seller does this the buyer receives more than that for which he paid. <b>Rather, he weighs all</b> the merchandise <b>at the same time and lets</b> the scales <b>tilt once for all</b> the merchandise.
§ <b>The Sages taught: The fulcrum of a scale</b> must be <b>suspen-ded in the air</b> so that the point the lever goes through it is at a distance of <b>three handbreadths</b> from the ceiling, <b>and</b> the pans of the scale must be <b>three handbreadths above the ground. And</b> the scale’s <b>lever and cord,</b> from which each pan is suspended, must be <b>twelve handbreadths</b> long. <b>And</b> the fulcrum of a scale <b>of wool-weavers and glassmakers</b> must be <b>suspended in the air</b> at a distance of <b>two handbreadths</b> from the ceiling, <b>and</b> the pans of the scale must be <b>two handbreadths above the ground. And its lever and cord</b> must be <b>nine handbreadths</b> long.
<b>And</b> the fulcrum of a scale <b>of a storekeeper and of a homeowner</b> must be <b>suspended in the air</b> at a distance of <b>one handbreadth</b> from the ceiling, <b>and</b> the pans of the scale must be <b>one handbreadth above the ground. And its lever and cord</b> must be <b>six handbreadths long. And</b> the fulcrums of small <b>scales [<i>turtanei</i>]</b> used for weighing gold and silver must be <b>suspended in the air</b> at a distance of <b>three fingerbreadths</b> from the ceiling, <b>and</b> the pans of the scales must be <b>three fingerbreadths above the ground.</b> The <i>tanna</i> continues: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>its lever and cord, I do not know</b> their required length.
Since the function of each type of balance scale is mentioned with the exception of the first type, the Gemara asks: <b>And that</b> large balance scale, which is mentioned <b>first, for what</b> is it used?

Daf 89b

<b>Rav Pappa says:</b> It is a balance scale <b>for blacksmiths,</b> who weigh heavy pieces of metal.
<b>Rabbi Mani Bar Pattish says: Just as</b> the Sages <b>said with regard to the prohibition of</b> the scales that one may not use a scale that does not meet the criteria listed in the <i>baraita</i>, <b>so</b> too <b>they said</b> that this applies <b>with regard to their ritual impurity.</b> In other words, if the cords and pole are not attached in the proper manner, they are not susceptible to ritual impurity as part of the scale.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> this statement <b>teaching us? We learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kelim</i> 29:5): With regard to the <b>rope</b> from which the <b>scales</b> are suspended, if the balance scale belongs <b>to a storekeeper or to homeowners</b> it must be <b>one handbreadth</b> in length for it to be susceptible to ritual impurity. Why, then, is the statement of Rabbi Mani Bar Pattish necessary? The Gemara answers: Although the mishna in tractate <i>Kelim</i> discusses the rope from which the scales are suspended, <b>it was</b> still <b>necessary for</b> Rabbi Mani Bar Pattish to mention the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the scale’s <b>lever and cord, which we did not learn about</b> in that mishna.
§ <b>The Sages taught: One may not prepare weights of tin [<i>ba’atz</i>], nor of lead, nor of a metal alloy [<i>gisteron</i>], nor of any other types of metal,</b> because all of these deteriorate over time and the buyer will ultimately pay for more merchandise than he receives. <b>But one</b> may <b>prepare</b> weights <b>of</b> hard <b>rock and of glass.</b>
<b>The Sages</b> further <b>taught: One may not prepare the leveler,</b> used to remove the excess from the mouth of a vessel, <b>from a gourd, because it is a light</b> material and does not level effectively, thereby causing a loss for the seller. <b>And</b> it may <b>not</b> be made <b>of metal, because it weighs down</b> and removes too much of the merchandise, leading to a loss for the buyer. <b>But one</b> may <b>prepare it from</b> the wood <b>of an olive</b> tree, <b>or of a nut</b> tree, or <b>of a sycamore</b> tree, <b>or of a boxwood</b> tree,which are of medium weight.
<b>The Sages taught: One may not prepare the leveler</b> in such a manner that <b>one of its sides is thick and one</b> other <b>side is thin,</b> because in such a case the two sides will not level equally. Furthermore, <b>one may not level all at once,</b> by a single quick movement, <b>as one who levels all at once</b> acts in a manner that is <b>bad for the seller and good for the buyer,</b> because he removes less of the excess than one who levels in the regular fashion. <b>And</b> conversely <b>one may not level little by little,</b> i.e., with several slow movements, <b>as</b> this is <b>bad for the buyer and good for the seller.</b>
<b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said with regard to all</b> these <i>halakhot</i>: <b>Woe to me if I say</b> them, and <b>woe unto me if I do not say</b> them. <b>If I say</b> them, <b>perhaps swindlers will learn</b> new methods of cheating of which they were previously unaware. <b>And if I do not say</b> them, <b>perhaps swindlers will say: Torah scholars are not well versed in our handiwork. A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Did</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai decide to <b>say</b> these <i>halakhot</i> in public <b>or did he not say</b> them? <b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says: He said them, and he said them on</b> the basis of <b>this verse: “For the ways of the Lord are right, and the just walk in them; but transgressors stumble over them”</b> (Hosea 14:10).
§ The Gemara further discusses weights and measures. <b>The Sages taught: “You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measure [<i>bammidda</i>], in weight, or in measure [<i>uvamesura</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 19:35). The <i>baraita</i> defines these terms: <b>“In measure [<i>bammidda</i>],” this</b> is referring to <b>measuring land,</b> teaching <b>that</b> in order to measure land in a just manner <b>one may not measure for one</b> person <b>in the summer</b> when the measuring rope has become dry and short, <b>and for one</b> other individual <b>in the rainy season,</b> when the measuring rope is wet and limp, and therefore stretches more. <b>“In weight”</b> means <b>that one may not cover his weights in salt,</b> as salt erodes the weights, causing a loss for the buyer. <b>“Or in measure [<i>bamesura</i>]”</b> means <b>that one may not cause</b> liquid he is measuring <b>to foam</b> by pouring it speedily, as this results in a loss for the buyer, who receives less of the liquid than the amount for which he paid.
The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> it can be inferred by means of an <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inference <b>that if</b> in the case of <b>a <i>mesura</i>, which is</b> a measure equivalent to merely <b>one thirty-sixth of a <i>log</i>, the Torah was particular that</b> one must measure honestly, so too, <b><i>a fortiori</i>,</b> one must be careful in the case <b>of one <i>hin</i>, and a half-<i>hin</i>, and a third-<i>hin</i>, and a quarter-<i>hin</i>,</b> which is twelve <i>log</i>, <b>and one <i>log</i>, and a half-<i>log</i>, and a quarter-<i>log</i></b>, <b>and a half-<i>tomen</i>,</b> i.e., one-sixteenth of a <i>kav</i>, <b>and</b> even <b>an <i>ukla</i>,</b> a smaller unit, as defined below.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: It is prohibited for a person to keep in his house a measure</b> that is <b>too small or too large</b> than its supposed volume or weight, <b>and</b> this is the case <b>even</b> if he does not measure with it but simply uses <b>it</b> as <b>a chamber pot for urine. Rav Pappa said: We said</b> this prohibition <b>only with regard to a place where</b> measures <b>are not stamped</b> with the government’s seal, which confirms that the measure is accurate. <b>But in a place where</b> the measures <b>are stamped, if</b> the buyer <b>does not see the seal he would not take</b> the merchandise. Since they could not be used dishonestly, one is permitted to utilize these measures for other purposes. <b>And in a place where</b> measures <b>are not stamped as well, we said</b> that it is prohibited to keep these measures in one’s house <b>only</b> in a place <b>where they do not inspect</b> measures to see if they are fit for use. <b>But</b> if <b>they do inspect</b> measures, <b>we have no</b> problem <b>with it.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> that <b>is not so;</b> one is never permitted to keep incorrect measures in his house, as <b>sometimes it happens</b> that one measures <b>at twilight,</b> when people are hurried, <b>and</b> consequently <b>it happens</b> that the buyer <b>takes</b> the merchandise despite the fact that it was measured with an incorrect measure. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A person may not keep in his house a measure</b> that is <b>too small or too large, even</b> if <b>it</b> is used as <b>a chamber pot for urine. But he</b> may <b>prepare</b> measures in accordance with the established format: Measurements of <b>a <i>se’a</i>; a <i>tarkav</i>,</b> which is three <i>kav</i> or one-half of a <i>se’a</i>; <b>and a half-<i>tarkav</i>,</b> which is one and one-half <i>kav</i>; <b>and a <i>kav</i>; and a half-<i>kav</i>; and a quarter-<i>kav</i></b>; <b>and a <i>tomen</i>,</b> which is one-eighth of a <i>kav</i>; <b>and a half-<i>tomen</i>;</b>

Daf 90a

<b>and an <i>ukla</i>. And how much is an <i>ukla</i>?</b> It is <b>one-fifth of a quarter</b> of a <i>kav</i>. <b>And</b> in the case <b>of liquid measures, one</b> may <b>prepare a <i>hin</i>,</b> which is twelve <i>log</i>; <b>and a half-<i>hin</i>,</b> or six <i>log</i>; <b>and a third</b>-<b><i>hin</i>,</b> or four <i>log</i>; <b>and a quarter-<i>hin</i>,</b> three <i>log</i>; <b>and a <i>log</i>; and a half</b>-<b><i>log</i>; and a quarter</b>-<i>log</i>; <b>and an eighth-</b><i>log</i>; <b>and an eighth of an eighth-</b><i>log</i>, <b>and this,</b> the last mentioned, <b>is a <i>kortov</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And let one also prepare</b> a measure equal to <b>two <i>kav</i>.</b> The Gemara answers that this measure is not used, lest people <b>come to mistake it for a <i>tarkav</i>,</b> which is three <i>kav</i>. The Gemara observes: <b>Apparently, people err</b> by <b>one-third</b> of a measure. <b>If that is so, one should also not prepare</b> a measure equal to <b>a <i>kav</i>, as</b> people may <b>come to mistake it for a half-<i>tarkav</i>,</b> which is equal to one and one-half <i>kav</i>. <b>Rather, this is the reason that one may not prepare a two-<i>kav</i></b> measure: <b>That</b> people might <b>come to mistake it for a half-<i>tarkav</i>,</b> which is equal to one and one-half <i>kav</i>.
The Gemara again suggests: <b>Apparently, people err</b> by <b>one-quarter</b> of a measure. <b>If that is so, one should also not prepare</b> measures of <b>a half-<i>tomen</i>,</b> which is one-sixteenth of a <i>kav</i>, <b>and an <i>ukla</i>,</b> which is one-twentieth of a <i>kav</i>. Since they differ by only one-fifth, there is a concern that people might mistake one measure for the other. <b>Rav Pappa said: People are well-versed in small measures</b> and can distinguish between them.
The Gemara continues: If people err by one-quarter of a measure, then since one may prepare a measure equal to four <i>log</i>, <b>one-third of a <i>hin</i>, let one not prepare</b> a measure equal to three <i>log</i>, <b>one-quarter</b> of <b>a <i>hin</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> these measures <b>were</b> used <b>in the Temple, the Sages did not decree</b> that they not be used. The Gemara asks: <b>In the Temple as well, let</b> the Sages <b>decree</b> that they should not be used, in case the two measures are mistaken for each other. The Gemara answers: The <b>priests</b> who serve in the Temple <b>are vigilant</b> and would not commit this error.
§ <b>Shmuel says:</b> If the residents of a certain place want to change the standard of their measures and augment them by a certain fraction, <b>they may not increase the measures</b> by <b>more than one-sixth, and</b> they may <b>not</b> increase the value of <b>a coin</b> by <b>more than one-sixth</b> of its previous value. <b>And one who profits</b> from his sales <b>may not profit</b> by <b>more than one-sixth.</b> The Gemara analyzes these statements. When Shmuel said: <b>They may not increase the measures</b> by <b>more than one-sixth, what is the reason</b> for this? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>because</b> doing so causes market <b>prices to rise,</b> the same concern should apply to raising the prices by <b>one-sixth,</b> and therefore this should <b>also not</b> be allowed.
<b>Rather,</b> you will say that the prohibition is <b>due to</b> concern for <b>exploitation;</b> and they may increase the measures only by up to one-sixth, so <b>that there will not be nullification of the transaction,</b> as the transaction is nullified only when the disparity is more than one-sixth of the value of the item. The Gemara raises an objection: <b>But doesn’t Rava say:</b> With regard to <b>any item that</b> is otherwise subject to the <i>halakhot</i> of exploitation, and it is sold <b>by measure, or by weight, or by number, even</b> if the disparity was <b>less than the measure of exploitation</b> in the transaction, the transaction is <b>reversed.</b> A disparity of one-sixth between the value of an item and its price constitutes exploitation only in cases where there is room for error in assessing the value of an item. In a case where the details of the item are easily quantifiable, any deviation from the designated quantity results in a nullification of the transaction.
<b>Rather,</b> the prohibition is <b>so that there will not be a loss</b> suffered <b>by the merchant,</b> who might not realize that a new standard was issued, and sell in accordance with the old standard. Since a merchant usually enjoys a profit of one-sixth of the value of an item, if the standard is not increased by more than this amount he will not suffer a loss, as at worst he will forfeit his profit margin.
This Gemara notes: This explanation is also difficult, since even if the aim is to ensure <b>that there will not be a loss</b> for the merchant, <b>does he not need</b> to earn <b>a profit?</b> There is a well-known adage in this regard: If you <b>buy and sell</b> without making any profit, <b>will</b> you <b>be called a merchant?</b> A merchant must profit from his sales; therefore, if this decree was instituted for the protection of merchants, the Sages should have ensured that they earn a profit.
<b>Rather, Rav Ḥisda said:</b> The prohibition is not based on logical reasoning. Instead, <b>Shmuel found a verse and interpreted it homiletically: “And the shekel shall be twenty <i>gera</i>; twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, ten, and five shekels, shall be your <i>maneh</i>”</b> (Ezekiel 45:12). According to this verse, the combination of all of these numbers, sixty shekels, is equivalent to a <i>maneh</i>.

Daf 90b

This is problematic: How can <b>a <i>maneh</i></b> consist of sixty shekels? Since each biblical shekel is equivalent to four dinars, if a <i>maneh</i> is equal to sixty shekels, a <i>maneh</i> <b>is two hundred and forty</b> dinars. But a <i>maneh</i> is actually equal to twenty-five shekels, which is one hundred dinars. <b>Rather,</b> one can <b>learn from</b> the verse <b>three</b> matters: <b>Learn from it</b> that the <b>sacred <i>maneh</i> was doubled,</b> so that it equaled fifty dinars, not twenty-five. <b>And</b> furthermore, as Ezekiel stated that the <i>maneh</i> will be sixty dinars, not fifty, <b>learn from it</b> that a community may <b>increase measures, but they may not increase</b> them by <b>more than one-sixth. And learn from it</b> that <b>the one-sixth</b> is calculated <b>from the outside,</b> i.e., it is one-sixth of the final sum, which is one-fifth of the previous sum.
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Pappa bar Shmuel instituted</b> a new <b>measure of three <i>kefiza</i>,</b> which is equal to three <i>log</i>. The Sages <b>said to him: But doesn’t Shmuel say</b> that <b>one may not increase the measures</b> by <b>more than one-sixth?</b> You have added one-third, as there already exists a measure of a half-kav, which is the equivalent of two <i>log</i>. Rav Pappa bar Shmuel <b>said to them: I instituted a new measure.</b> He <b>sent</b> the measure <b>to Pumbedita, and they did not accept it; he sent it to</b> the city of <b>Paphunya, and they accepted it and called it the measure</b> of <b>Pappa.</b>
§ The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the ensuing discussions: <b>Hoarders of produce; one may not hoard; and one may not export; and one may not earn</b> a profit; <b>twice</b> from the sale <b>of eggs;</b> they <b>sound the alarm; and one may not leave.</b>
<b>The Sages taught: Hoarders of produce,</b> who drive up prices by causing a shortage of available goods, <b>and usurers, and those</b> sellers <b>who</b> falsely <b>reduce</b> their <b>measures, and those who raise</b> market <b>prices</b> by selling for more than the accepted price, <b>about them the verse states:</b> “You that would swallow the needy and destroy the poor of the land, <b>saying: When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell produce? And the Shabbat, that we may set forth grain? Making the measure small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances of deceit”</b> (Amos 8:4–5). <b>And it is written: “The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob: Surely I will never forget any of their works”</b> (Amos 8:7).
The Gemara asks: <b>Hoarders of produce, such as whom? Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Such as Shabbtai, the hoarder of produce,</b> who would buy and hoard large amounts of produce and later sell it at a high price.
The Gemara relates: <b>Shmuel’s father would sell produce during</b> the period of the <b>early</b> market <b>price,</b> when produce is cheap, <b>for the early</b> market <b>price. His son Shmuel</b> acted differently, and <b>would keep the produce and sell it during</b> the period of the <b>late</b> market <b>price,</b> when produce is expensive, <b>for the early</b> market <b>price. They sent</b> a message <b>from there,</b> Eretz Yisrael: The practice <b>of the father is better than</b> that <b>of the son. What is the reason</b> for this? A market <b>price that</b> has been <b>eased</b> and starts out low will remain <b>eased,</b> with little increase over the course of the year. Therefore, one who makes produce available at the beginning of the season, like Shmuel’s father, aids people during the entire year. By contrast, a market price that starts out high, because people are not making their produce available at the market, is not easily lowered.
<b>Rav says: A person may turn his</b> own <b><i>kav</i> into a storeroom,</b> i.e., he may hoard the produce of his own field and sell it only at a later stage, without violating the prohibition of hoarding produce. <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may not hoard produce</b> of <b>items that contain</b> an element of basic <b>sustenance, such as wines, oils, and flours, but</b> in the case of <b>spices,</b> such as <b>cumin and pepper, it is permitted. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is <b>with regard to one who buys</b> that produce <b>from the market</b> to resell later; <b>but with regard to one who brings in</b> produce <b>from his</b> own field, <b>it is permitted</b> for any type of produce.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And it is permitted for a person to hoard produce in Eretz Yisrael</b> for these <b>three years: The year preceding the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and the year that follows the Sabbatical</b> Year, because the land lies fallow during the seventh year, the Sabbatical Year, and the produce of the sixth year must last through these three years, until near the end of the eighth year.
<b>And in years of drought one may not hoard even a <i>kav</i> of carobs, because</b> he thereby <b>brings a curse on</b> market <b>prices,</b> as everyone is fearful of selling and even a small fluctuation in supply can cause a significant rise in prices. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who was living in Eretz Yisrael, <b>said to his servant Fuga: Go</b> and <b>hoard produce for me</b> for the coming <b>three years: The year preceding the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>the Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and the year that follows the Sabbatical</b> Year.
§ <b>The Sages taught: One may not export produce from Eretz Yisrael</b> if it consists of <b>items that contain</b> an element of basic <b>sustenance, such as wines, oils, and flours,</b> because this causes them to become more expensive in Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira permits</b> export <b>in</b> the case of <b>wine, because</b> this <b>lessens licentiousness</b> in Eretz Yisrael. <b>And just as one may not export</b> these types of produce <b>from Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to outside</b> of <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>so</b> too <b>one may not export</b> them <b>from Eretz Yisrael to Syria,</b> as Syria is not considered part of Eretz Yisrael in this context. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>permits</b> the export of produce

Daf 91a

<b>from</b> the northernmost <b>province [<i>mehiparkheya</i>]</b> of Eretz Yisrael <b>to</b> the southernmost <b>province</b> of Syria.
<b>The Sages taught: One may not earn</b> a profit <b>in Eretz Yisrael by</b> buying and reselling <b>items that contain</b> an element of basic <b>sustenance, such as wines, oils, and flours,</b> because this causes their price to rise. Rather, those who grow the produce should sell them in the markets, without recourse to a middleman.
The Sages <b>said of Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya that he would earn</b> a profit <b>through</b> the sale of <b>wine and oil. With regard to wine, he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> ben Beteira, who says that it is permitted to export wine from Eretz Yisrael despite the fact that this causes it to become more expensive, as drinking wine leads to licentiousness. <b>With regard to oil, in Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya’s locale oil was common;</b> consequently, there was no concern that its price would rise if it were not sold directly to the consumer.
<b>The Sages taught: One may not earn</b> a profit <b>twice</b> from the sale <b>of eggs. Mari bar Mari said: Rav and Shmuel disagree</b> about the meaning of <b>that</b> statement. <b>One said</b> it means that the seller may not charge <b>double</b> the price he paid for the eggs. <b>And one said</b> that one <b>merchant</b> may not sell <b>to</b> another <b>merchant;</b> rather, the merchant who buys from the owner of the eggs must sell directly to the consumer.
§ Apropos price fluctuations, the Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Sages taught:</b> A community <b>sounds the alarm</b> and gathers in public prayer <b>for merchandise [<i>perakmatya</i>]</b> whose price has dropped. <b>And even on Shabbat</b> it is permitted to cry and plead, even though one may not pray for his personal needs on Shabbat, as this hardship affects the entire public.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan said:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is referring specifically to merchandise that serves as the basis of the local economy, <b>such as linen garments in Babylonia, and wine and oil in Eretz Yisrael. Rav Yosef said: And that</b> <i>halakha</i>, that public prayer is recited even on Shabbat, applies only <b>when</b> the merchandise <b>was reduced in price and stood</b> at such prices that goods that had been worth <b>ten</b> are currently selling <b>for six.</b>
<b>The Sages taught: One may not leave Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to</b> live <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>unless</b> the price of <b>two <i>se’a</i></b> of grain <b>stood at a <i>sela</i>,</b> which is double its usual price. <b>Rabbi Shimon said: When</b> does this exception, permitting one to leave Eretz Yisrael under certain circumstances, apply? It applies <b>when one is unable to find</b> produce <b>to buy,</b> as he has no money. <b>But when one</b> has money and <b>is able to find</b> produce <b>to buy, even</b> if the price of <b>a <i>se’a</i></b> of grain <b>stood at a <i>sela</i>, he may not leave.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai would likewise say: Elimelech</b> and his sons <b>Mahlon and Chilion were prominent</b> members <b>of</b> their <b>generation and were leaders of</b> their <b>generation. And for what</b> reason <b>were they punished?</b> They were punished <b>because they left Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to</b> go <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>as it is stated</b> concerning Naomi and Ruth: <b>“And all the city was astir concerning them, and the women said: Is this Naomi?”</b> (Ruth 1:19). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the phrase: <b>“Is this Naomi”?</b> How does this indicate that her husband and sons were punished for leaving Eretz Yisrael? <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that the women <b>said: Have you seen what befell Naomi, who left Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>for outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael? Not only did she not escape tribulations there, but she lost her status entirely.
<b>And Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> also <b>says</b> with regard to this passage: <b>That</b> very <b>day when Ruth the Moabite came to Eretz Yisrael, the wife of Boaz died,</b> i.e., from the moment of their arrival the possibility was created for Ruth’s eventual marriage to Boaz. <b>This</b> explains the adage <b>that people say: Before the deceased dies, the person</b> who will next be <b>in charge of his house arises,</b> as in this case Boaz’s new wife, Ruth, arrived as his previous wife died.
Apropos the story of Ruth the Gemara adds: <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The judge <b>Ibzan</b> of Bethlehem (see Judges 12:8–10) <b>is Boaz.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is he teaching us?</b> The Gemara explains that this comment is <b>in accordance with the other</b> statement <b>of Rabba bar Rav Huna, as Rabba bar Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says: Boaz prepared one hundred and twenty feasts for his children</b> at their weddings. <b>As it is stated,</b> concerning Ibzan: <b>“And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he sent abroad, and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years”</b> (Judges 12:9). The verse indicates that he had sixty children.
<b>And at each and every</b> wedding he prepared for his children, <b>he made two feasts, one in the house of the father</b> of the groom <b>and one in the house of the father-in-law</b> of the groom. <b>And he did not invite Manoah,</b> the future father of Samson, whose wife was barren (see Judges 13:2) <b>to any of them,</b> as <b>he said:</b> It is not worth inviting him; he is <b>a sterile mule, how will he pay me back?</b> Manoah will never invite me in return, as he has no children.
A Sage <b>taught: And all</b> of the children of Ibzan <b>died during his lifetime. And this</b> explains the adage <b>that people say: Why do you</b> need the <b>sixty,</b> the <b>sixty</b> children <b>that you beget during your lifetime? Go to the trouble and beget one who will be more diligent than sixty.</b> This adage refers to Boaz, who had sixty children who died, and yet his last child, born from Ruth, is his glory, as King David was born from this line.
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the ensuing statements that Rav Ḥanan bar Rava said that Rav said: <b>Melech; Abraham; ten years; when he died; and He alone was exalted. Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>Elimelech, and</b> Boaz’s father, <b>Salmon, and So-and-so,</b> the unnamed relative who was a closer relative to Elimelech than Boaz (Ruth 4:1), <b>and Naomi’s father, all of these are descendants of Nahshon, son of Amminadab,</b> the head of the tribe of Judah (see Ruth 4:20–21 and Numbers 2:3). The Gemara asks: <b>What is he teaching us</b> by this statement? He is teaching <b>that even</b> in the case of <b>one who has the merit of his ancestors</b> to protect him, this merit <b>does not stand for him when he leaves Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>to</b> go <b>outside of Eretz</b> Yisrael, as Elimelech died on account of this sin.
<b>And Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says</b> that <b>Rav says: The mother of Abraham</b> was called <b>Amatlai bat Karnevo. The mother of Haman</b> was called <b>Amatlai bat Orevati. And your mnemonic,</b> to ensure that the two are not confused for one another, is that a raven [<i>orev</i>] is <b>impure,</b> and in this manner one remembers that Orevati is the grandmother of the <b>impure</b> Haman, while a sheep [<i>kar</i>] is <b>pure,</b> which indicates that Karnevo is the grandmother of the <b>pure</b> Abraham.
Rav Ḥanan bar Rava continues: <b>The mother of David was named Natzvat bat Ada’el. The mother of Samson</b> was named <b>Tzelelponit, and his sister</b> was called <b>Nashyan.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the</b> practical <b>difference</b> as to what their names were? The Gemara answers: It is important with regard <b>to an answer for heretics</b> who inquire into the names of these women, which are not stated in the Bible. One can reply that there is a tradition handed down concerning their names.
<b>And Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says</b> that <b>Rav says: Our forefather Abraham was imprisoned</b> for <b>ten years,</b> because he rejected the idol worship that was accepted in his land. He was imprisoned for <b>three</b> years <b>in</b> the city of <b>Khuta, and seven</b> years <b>in Karddu. And Rav Dimi of Neharde’a teaches the opposite,</b> that he was imprisoned seven years in Khuta and three in Karddu. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: The small passage of Khuta, this is Ur of the Chaldeans</b> (see Genesis 11:31).
<b>And Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> On <b>that day when our forefather Abraham left the world, the leaders of the nations of the world stood in a line,</b> in the manner of mourners, <b>and said: Woe to the world that has lost</b>

Daf 91b

<b>its leader, and woe to the ship that has lost its captain.</b>
With regard to leaders, the Gemara adds that it is stated in praise of God: <b>“And You are exalted as head above all”</b> (I Chronicles 29:11). <b>Rav Ḥanan bar Rava says</b> that <b>Rav says: Even</b> one with the most insignificant position of authority, e.g., <b>an appointee over irrigation, is appointed by Heaven.</b>
The Gemara returns to its discussion of the punishment of Elimelech and his sons, which Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai says they received because they left Eretz Yisrael. <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa says: Heaven forfend</b> that they sinned in this manner, <b>as</b> if Elimelech and his sons <b>had found even bran they would not have left</b> Eretz Yisrael. <b>But rather, for what</b> reason were <b>they punished?</b> They were punished <b>because they should have requested mercy</b> of God <b>for their generation, and they did not request</b> this, <b>as it is stated: “When you cry, let those you have gathered deliver you”</b> (Isaiah 57:13).
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> that it is prohibited to leave Eretz Yisrael <b>only</b> if <b>money is cheap,</b> i.e., not excessively difficult to obtain, <b>and produce is expensive,</b> similar to the case in the <i>baraita</i> where two <i>se’a</i> of wheat are sold for a <i>sela</i>. <b>But</b> when <b>money is expensive,</b> i.e., it is difficult to earn money for sustenance, <b>even</b> if the price of <b>four <i>se’a</i></b> of grain <b>stood at a <i>sela</i>, one</b> may <b>leave</b> Eretz Yisrael in order to survive.
The Gemara provides <b>a mnemonic</b> for the following list of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s recollections: <b><i>Sela</i>; laborer; carob; boy; they would say.</b> The first statement is <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I remember when four <i>se’a</i></b> of produce <b>were</b> sold <b>for</b> one <b><i>sela</i>, and</b> yet <b>there were many swollen from hunger in Tiberias, as they did not have</b> even one <b><i>issar</i></b> coin with which to purchase food. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> further <b>said: I remember when laborers would not</b> agree to <b>work on the east</b> side of the <b>city,</b> because <b>they would die from the smell of the bread</b> that would waft over them from the city’s west side.
The Gemara continues to relate other, more salutary, memories: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I remember when a child would break a carob, and a line of honey would extend over his two arms. And Rabbi Elazar said: I remember when a raven would take</b> a piece of <b>meat, and a line of fat would extend from the top of the wall</b> upon which it was standing <b>to the ground. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I remember when a boy and girl, of sixteen and seventeen years of age, would walk</b> together <b>in the market, and they would not sin. And Rabbi Yoḥanan said: I remember when they would say in the study hall that one who agrees with</b> the gentiles <b>falls into their hands,</b> and <b>that one who relies on them</b> sees that which is <b>his</b> become <b>theirs.</b>
The Gemara returns to its discussion of the story of Ruth. <b>It is written: “Mahlon and Chilion”</b> (Ruth 1:2), <b>and it is written</b> elsewhere: <b>“Joash and Saraph,</b> who had dominion in Moab” (I Chronicles 4:22). Apparently, both names refer to the same individuals who married Moabite wives. <b>Rav and Shmuel</b> disagreed with regard to their true names. <b>One says: Their</b> given <b>names were Mahlon and Chilion, and why were they called</b> by the <b>names Saraph and Joash?</b> One was called <b>Joash [<i>yoash</i>] because they despaired [<i>nitya’ashu</i>] of the redemption</b> of Eretz Yisrael, as they established themselves in Moab and lived there for many years. The other was called <b>Saraph, because they were liable</b> to receive the punishment of <b>burning [<i>sereifa</i>] for</b> their sins against <b>God,</b> because they left their community.
<b>And one</b> of them <b>says: Their</b> given <b>names were Joash and Saraph, and why were they called</b> by the <b>names Mahlon and Chilion?</b> One was called <b>Mahlon [<i>maḥlon</i>] because they made their bodies profane [<i>ḥullin</i>], and</b> the other was called <b>Chilion [<i>khilyon</i>] because they were liable to</b> receive the punishment of <b>destruction [<i>kelaya</i>] for</b> their sins against <b>God.</b>
The Gemara notes: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with the one who says</b> that <b>their</b> given <b>names were Mahlon and Chilion. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And Jokim, and the men of Cozeba, and Joash, and Saraph, who had dominion in Moab, and Jashubi Lehem. And the matters are ancient”</b> (I Chronicles 4:22)? <b>“And Jokim,” this</b> refers to <b>Joshua, who established [<i>shehekim</i>]</b> and kept the <b>oath with people of Gibeon</b> (see Joshua, chapter 9). <b>“And the men of Cozeba,” these are the men of Gibeon, who lied [<i>shekizevu</i>] to Joshua</b> by saying that they came from a distant land. <b>“And Joash, and Saraph,” these are Mahlon and Chilion. And why were they called</b> by the <b>names Joash and Saraph?</b> One was called <b>Joash because they despaired [<i>shenitya’ashu</i>] of the redemption;</b> the other was called <b>Saraph because they were liable</b> to receive the punishment of <b>burning [<i>sereifa</i>] for</b> their sins against <b>God.</b>
<b>“Who had dominion in Moab,”</b> this means <b>that they married Moabite women. “And Jashubi Lehem,” this</b> is referring to <b>Ruth the Moabite, who returned [<i>sheshava</i>] and attached</b> herself <b>to Bethlehem</b> of <b>Judea. “And the matters are ancient,”</b> this means that <b>these matters were said by the Ancient of Days,</b> i.e., they occurred through God’s will, <b>as it is written: “I have found David My servant”</b> (Psalms 89:21); <b>and</b> the same term “found” also appears with regard to the daughters of Lot, as <b>it is written: “Your two daughters that are found</b> here” (Genesis 19:15). This teaches that David’s ancestry can be traced this far back, as he was destined to be born from Moab, who was the son of Lot’s daughter and Lot himself.
The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that analyzes the next verse: <b>“These were the potters, and those who dwelt among plantations and hedges; there they dwelt occupied in the king’s work”</b> (I Chronicles 4:23). <b>“These were the potters [<i>yotzerim</i>],” these are the sons of Jonadab, son of Rechab, who kept [<i>natzeru</i>] their father’s oath.</b>
<b>“Those who dwelt among plantations,” this</b> is referring to <b>Solomon, who in his kingship</b> was <b>similar to a plant. “And hedges [<i>ugdera</i>],” this</b> is the <b>Sanhedrin, which fenced [<i>gaderu</i>] in the breaches of the Jewish people</b> by means of ordinances. <b>“There they dwelt occupied in the king’s work,” this</b> is referring to <b>Ruth the Moabite, who saw the kingship of Solomon,</b> the <b>grandson of her grandson. As it is stated</b> about Solomon: <b>“And he caused a throne to be set for the king’s mother”</b> (I Kings 2:19), <b>and Rabbi Elazar says:</b> This means <b>for the mother of the</b> dynasty of <b>kingship,</b> i.e., Ruth.
§ Since the Gemara has discussed times of famine in Eretz Yisrael, it concludes the chapter with a blessing of times of prosperity: <b>The Sages taught:</b> When the verse states: <b>“And you shall eat of the produce of the old store”</b> (Leviticus 25:22), referring to the produce grown in the sixth year of the Sabbatical cycle, this means <b>without <i>salmanton</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>Without <i>salmanton</i>? Rav Naḥman said: Without worms [<i>retzinta</i>]</b> that consume the produce, <b>and Rav Sheshet said: Without blight,</b> which destroys the taste of the produce.
The Gemara notes: It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Sheshet,</b> and it <b>is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman.</b> It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Naḥman:</b> From the verse: “And you shall sow the eighth year, <b>and you shall eat</b> of the produce of <b>the old store,</b> until the ninth year” (Leviticus 25:22), one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the Jewish people will wait for the new</b> produce <b>because the old store has</b> been <b>destroyed.</b> Therefore <b>the</b> same <b>verse states: “Until its produce comes in,”</b> to indicate that they will not stop eating the old produce <b>until the</b> new <b>produce comes of itself,</b> i.e., until it is fully ripe and they do not need the old produce. The old produce will last until then and will not become worm infested, as stated by Rav Naḥman.
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Sheshet:</b> From the verse: <b>“And you shall eat of the produce of the old store,”</b> one <b>might</b> have thought that <b>the Jewish people will wait for the new</b> produce <b>due to the old store because</b> the old store will have gone <b>bad,</b> since blight will ruin the taste of the produce. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Until its produce comes in,”</b> which indicates that they will not stop eating the old produce <b>until the</b> new <b>produce comes of itself,</b> as the stored produce will not suffer from blight.
<b>The Sages taught</b> with regard to a verse in the chapter of the blessings stated to the Jewish people: <b>“And you shall eat old store long kept”</b> (Leviticus 26:10). This <b>teaches that any</b> produce <b>that is older than other</b> produce of that same type will be <b>better than</b> that <b>other</b> produce. <b>And I have</b> derived that this is the case <b>only</b> with regard to <b>items</b> for <b>which</b> it is the normal <b>manner to age them. From where</b> do I derive in the case of <b>items</b> for <b>which</b> it is <b>not</b> the normal <b>manner to age them,</b> e.g., fruit, that they too will improve with age? <b>The verse states: “Old store long kept,”</b> a general expression that indicates that <b>in any case</b> the land will keep its produce from spoiling, as all types of produce will improve with age.
The continuation of the verse: <b>“You shall bring forth the old from before the new,” teaches that there will be storehouses full of old</b> produce <b>and threshing floors full of new</b> produce, <b>and the Jewish people will say: How will we</b> manage to <b>take out this</b> produce from the storehouse <b>before that</b> produce is brought in? <b>Rav Pappa said: Everything</b> that is <b>old is superior</b> in quality to the new, <b>except for dates, liquor, and small fish,</b> which are better when they are fresh.

Daf 92a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who sells produce to another</b> that is sometimes purchased for consumption and sometimes for planting, <b>and</b> the buyer <b>planted it and it did not sprout, and even</b> if he had sold <b>flaxseeds,</b> which are only occasionally eaten, the seller <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for them,</b> i.e., he is not required to compensate the buyer. Since the buyer did not specify that he purchased the produce in order to plant it, the seller can claim that he assumed the buyer intended to eat it. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If he had sold <b>seeds</b> for <b>garden</b> plants, <b>which are not eaten</b> at all, then the seller <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for them,</b> as they were certainly purchased for planting.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> An amoraic dispute <b>was stated</b> with regard to <b>one who sells an ox to another and</b> the ox <b>is found</b> to be <b>one that habitually gores. Rav says: This is a mistaken transaction,</b> since the buyer can claim that he bought the ox specifically for labor, and an ox that gores is not suitable for this function. Therefore, the seller must take back the ox and reimburse the buyer. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> The sale is not voided, as the seller <b>can say to him: I sold it to you for slaughter,</b> and the fact that it gores is immaterial.
The Gemara suggests: <b>But let us see if</b> the buyer is <b>a man who</b> generally <b>purchases</b> oxen <b>for slaughter,</b> in which case it can be presumed that he also purchased this ox <b>for slaughter, or if</b> he is a man who generally purchases oxen <b>for plowing,</b> in which case it can be presumed that he also purchased this ox <b>for plowing.</b> The Gemara answers: The dispute <b>concerns a man who</b> sometimes <b>purchases</b> oxen <b>for this</b> purpose <b>and</b> sometimes <b>for that</b> purpose, and so it is uncertain for which purpose he purchased this ox.
The Gemara persists: <b>But let us see the payment</b> he made; <b>how much was it?</b> Since an ox fit for plowing costs more than one fit only for slaughter, the purpose for which the ox was purchased will be apparent from the price paid.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to discuss the case <b>where</b> the price of an ox to be slaughtered for its <b>meat appreciated and reached</b> the <b>value of</b> an ox for <b>plowing.</b> But if the price disparity is significant, there is no dispute. The Gemara asks: <b>If so, for</b> the sake of <b>what</b> practical <b>difference</b> did they discuss the case? Even if the ox was not suitable for the buyer’s purposes, he could sell it for the same price of the ox he needs. The Gemara answers: The practical <b>difference</b> is <b>with regard to the effort</b> of selling the ox in order to recover its value; who must go to the effort of doing so?
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case under discussion?

Daf 92b

<b>If</b> this is a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>does not</b> have sufficient funds for the buyer <b>to be reimbursed by him,</b> then <b>let</b> the buyer <b>retain the ox</b> itself <b>in lieu of his money, as people say:</b> If you wish to ensure that you will get paid, <b>collect</b> even <b>bran,</b> an inferior commodity, <b>from one who is in your debt.</b> Consequently, even according to the opinion of Rav, the buyer will be likely to retain the ox. What, then, is the practical difference between the opinions of Rav and Shmuel?
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to discuss the case <b>where</b> the seller <b>does have</b> sufficient funds for the buyer <b>to be reimbursed by him.</b>
The Gemara explains the logic of each opinion: <b>Rav says: This is a mistaken transaction,</b> as in cases of uncertainty <b>we follow the majority, and</b> since <b>the majority</b> of people <b>purchase</b> oxen <b>for plowing,</b> it is presumed that this buyer also purchased the ox for plowing. Accordingly, since the ox he received was not suitable for plowing, the sale is void. <b>And Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: When we follow the majority,</b> that is only <b>with regard to ritual matters,</b> but <b>with regard to monetary matters,</b> such as this, we do <b>not</b> follow the majority. Accordingly, there is no basis for voiding the sale.
The Gemara cites <b>a mnemonic</b> that indicates the topics of the cases it will reference to challenge either Rav’s or Shmuel’s opinion: <b>Woman, and slave, ox, oxen, and produce.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav’s opinion from a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 15b): With regard to <b>a woman who was widowed or divorced,</b> and is in dispute with her husband or his heirs over the value of the payment she should receive for her marriage contract, <b>and she says:</b> When <b>you married me</b> I was <b>a virgin,</b> and so I am entitled to two hundred dinars, <b>and he says: That is not</b> the case; <b>rather,</b> when <b>I married you,</b> you were <b>a widow,</b> and so you are entitled to only one hundred dinars, then <b>if there are witnesses that she went out</b> of her father’s house to her wedding <b>with a veil [<i>hinnuma</i>] or</b> with the hair of <b>her head loose,</b> in the typical manner of virgin brides, that is considered sufficient evidence in support of her claim, and so the payment of <b>her marriage contract is two hundred</b> dinars.
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> that she receives two hundred dinars is <b>that there are witnesses</b> to her claim. Therefore, if <b>there were no witnesses,</b> her claim would <b>not</b> be successful. The Gemara asks: <b>But why? Let us say</b> that since there is an uncertainty, one should <b>follow</b> the <b>majority of women, and</b> since the <b>majority of women marry as virgins,</b> it should be presumed that this woman also married as a virgin. Accordingly she should be entitled to two hundred dinars. Since this is not the case, it is apparent that the majority is not followed in monetary matters.
<b>Ravina said:</b> In this case, one cannot decide the case based on the majority of women <b>because there is</b> room <b>to say</b> that it is so that the <b>majority of women marry as virgins and</b> only <b>a minority</b> marry <b>as widows</b> or non-virgins. <b>But</b> it is also so that there is an additional presumption: The marriage of <b>anyone who marries</b> as <b>a virgin generates publicity</b> of that fact. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>this</b> woman, who is in a dispute over the value of her marriage contract, <b>because her</b> marriage <b>did not generate publicity</b> of her marrying as a virgin, the ability to apply what is true of <b>the majority</b> of women to her case <b>is undermined.</b> Accordingly, there is no proof that the majority is not followed in monetary matters.
The Gemara questions this: <b>If</b> it is really true that the marriage of <b>anyone who marries</b> as <b>a virgin generates publicity</b> of that fact, then even <b>when there are witnesses</b> that she was a virgin bride, <b>what of it? From</b> the fact that <b>her</b> marriage <b>did not generate publicity</b> of her marrying as a virgin, perforce <b>they are false witnesses.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> one must modify the above argument to say that <b>the majority</b> of marriages <b>of women who marry</b> as <b>virgins generate publicity</b> of that fact, <b>and</b> with regard to <b>this</b> woman, <b>since her</b> marriage <b>did not generate publicity</b> of her having been married as a virgin, the ability to apply what is true of <b>the majority</b> of women to her case <b>is undermined.</b>
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a challenge to Shmuel’s opinion from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one who sells a slave to another, and</b> the slave <b>is found to be a thief or a gambler [<i>kuvyustus</i>],</b> and the buyer does not wish to have such a slave, nevertheless <b>it has come to him,</b> i.e., the slave is acquired by the one who purchased him and the transaction is nonrefundable. By contrast, if the slave is found to be <b>an armed bandit [<i>listim</i>] or</b> has been judged and <b>written</b> to be executed <b>by the govenment,</b> then the buyer can return the slave to the seller and <b>say to him: That which is yours is before you;</b> return the money I paid for him, as the sale is void.
The Gemara explains the proof from the <i>baraita</i>: In <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>,

Daf 93a

<b>what is the reason</b> that the sale is not considered to be a mistaken transaction? Is it <b>not because a majority</b> of slaves <b>are like this,</b> i.e., either thieves or gamblers? Apparently, the majority is followed in monetary matters.
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>No,</b> it is because <b>all</b> slaves <b>are like this.</b> Accordingly, no proof can be drawn as to whether we follow the majority in monetary matters.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another challenge to Rav’s opinion from a mishna (<i>Bava Kamma</i> 46a): In the case of an innocuous <b>ox that gored</b> and killed <b>a cow, and</b> the cow’s <b>fetus was found</b> dead <b>at its side, and it is not known whether</b> the cow <b>calved before</b> the ox <b>gored it</b> and the fetus’ death was unrelated to the goring, <b>or whether it calved after</b> the ox <b>gored it</b> and the fetus died on account of the goring, the ox’s owner <b>pays half</b> the cost of <b>the damage for the cow,</b> as is the <i>halakha</i> for an innocuous ox (see Exodus 21:35), <b>and one-quarter</b> of the cost of the damage <b>for the offspring.</b> Since it is uncertain whether the ox caused the death of the fetus, its owner pays for half of the standard liability of half the cost of the damage.
The Gemara explains the proof from the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But why,</b> according to Rav, should he only pay for one-quarter of the damage to the fetus? Since there is an uncertainty, <b>let us say: Follow</b> the <b>majority of cows, and</b> since the <b>majority of cows become pregnant and calve</b> live offspring, one should conclude that <b>this</b> cow, which did not, <b>certainly miscarried due to</b> the ox <b>goring</b> it, and the ox’s owner should be liable for half the cost of the fetus. Since that line of reasoning is not applied here, it is apparent that the majority is not followed in monetary matters.
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>There,</b> the reason that the ox’s owner pays for only one-quarter of the damage for the fetus is <b>due</b> to the fact <b>that we are uncertain</b> about how it died, <b>as it is</b> possible <b>to say</b> that the ox <b>approached</b> the cow <b>from its front and</b> it was <b>due to</b> the cow’s <b>fright,</b> not due to the goring, that <b>it miscarried,</b> meaning that the ox’s owner would not be liable; <b>and it is</b> also possible <b>to say that</b> the ox <b>approached</b> the cow <b>from behind it and gored it, and</b> that is why the cow <b>miscarried.</b> Accordingly, the payment for such damage constitutes <b>property of uncertain ownership, and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>all property of uncertain ownership is divided</b> equally between the two parties.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say</b> that this dispute between Rav and Shmuel <b>is parallel to</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>,</b> as it is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>an ox that was grazing and</b> another <b>ox</b> that <b>was found killed at its side, even though this</b> dead ox <b>has been gored and that</b> grazing ox <b>is forewarned with regard to goring,</b> or <b>this</b> dead ox <b>has been bitten and that</b> grazing ox <b>is forewarned with regard to biting,</b> nevertheless <b>one does not say</b> that <b>it is evident that this</b> grazing ox <b>gored</b> the dead ox <b>or that</b> grazing ox <b>bit it,</b> despite the fact such behavior is typical for the ox; rather, one cannot draw any definite conclusions. <b>Rabbi Aḥa says</b> that in the case of a rutting male <b>camel that is rampaging among</b> other <b>camels and</b> another <b>camel</b> that <b>was found killed at its side, it is evident that this</b> rampaging camel <b>killed it,</b> as such behavior is typical for a rutting camel. Therefore, the owner of that camel is liable.
Those who suggested the parallel between the tannaitic dispute and the dispute between Rav and Shmuel <b>assumed that a majority and</b> a logical <b>presumption</b> about whether an event will happen <b>are equivalent</b> in their capacity to determine the facts of a case. Consequently, <b>let us say</b> that <b>Rav, who says</b> that one follows the majority in monetary matters, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Aḥa,</b> who follows a presumption to determine the facts of a case, <b>and</b> that <b>Shmuel, who says</b> that one does not follow the majority in monetary matters, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> who does not follow a presumption.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Rav</b> could have <b>said to you: I am stating</b> my ruling <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> as <b>the first <i>tanna</i> says</b> that one cannot draw a definite conclusion <b>only there,</b> in the case of the grazing ox, <b>as we do not follow a presumption</b> in monetary matters, <b>but</b> he concedes that <b>we follow the majority</b> in monetary matters.
<b>And Shmuel</b> could have <b>said to you: I am stating</b> my ruling <b>even in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Aḥa,</b> as <b>Rabbi Aḥa says</b> that one can draw a definite conclusion <b>only there,</b> in the case of the camels, <b>since we follow a presumption</b> in monetary matters, <b>as</b> this camel <b>itself is presumed,</b> based on its behavior, to be the killer. <b>But</b> he concedes that <b>we do not follow the majority</b> in deciding monetary matters.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another challenge to Rav’s opinion from the mishna: With regard to <b>one who sells produce to another</b> that is sometimes purchased for consumption and sometimes for planting, <b>and</b> the buyer <b>planted it and it did not sprout, and even</b> if he had sold <b>flaxseeds,</b> which are rarely sold as food, the seller <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for them.</b>
The Gemara explains the proof: <b>What</b> novelty is indicated by saying: <b>Even</b> if he had sold flaxseeds? Is it <b>not</b> that <b>even</b> where he sold <b>flaxseeds, of which the majority is purchased for planting, and</b> they were not suitable for that purpose, <b>nevertheless</b> the sale stands because <b>we do not follow the majority</b> in monetary matters?
The Gemara concedes that the mishna cannot be reconciled with Rav’s opinion, but suggests that there are other <i>tanna’im</i> who hold in accordance with his opinion. It <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who sells produce to another, and</b> the buyer <b>planted it and it did not sprout,</b> if the produce was <b>seeds</b> for <b>garden</b> plants, <b>which are not eaten</b> at all, then the seller <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for them.</b> If the produce was <b>flaxseeds,</b> which are only occasionally eaten, then the seller <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for them. Rabbi Yosei says:</b>

Daf 93b

The seller <b>gives</b> back <b>to</b> the buyer <b>the value of the seeds.</b> Since the majority of flaxseeds are sold are for planting, it is a mistaken transaction. <b>They said to him,</b> i.e., to Rabbi Yosei: <b>Many,</b> i.e., a majority of people, <b>purchase</b> flaxseeds <b>for purposes other</b> than planting. Consequently, the sale stands.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> are the <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> in this <i>baraita</i> who have a dispute that parallels the dispute between Rav and Shmuel? <b>If we say</b> that they are <b>Rabbi Yosei and</b> the opinion cited as: <b>They said to him,</b> that is incorrect, as <b>both of them</b> hold that one <b>follows the majority</b> in monetary matters. Their dispute concerns only which majority to follow: One <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the opinion cited as: They said to him, <b>follows the majority of people</b> making purchases, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yosei, <b>follows the majority</b> of the volume <b>of seeds</b> that are sold overall. The disparity arises because the majority of sales are each made with a relatively small quantity of seeds that are purchased for purposes other than planting. The minority of sales involve large quantities of seeds that are purchased for planting. This means that the majority of the seeds sold overall are purchased for planting, but the majority of people purchasing seeds do so for purposes other than planting.
<b>Rather,</b> the dispute that parallels the dispute between Rav and Shmuel is <b>either</b> the dispute between <b>the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabbi Yosei, or the</b> dispute between <b>the first <i>tanna</i> and</b> the opinion cited as: <b>They said to him.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the seller bears financial responsibility for selling seeds that did not sprout, <b>what is</b> he liable to <b>give to</b> the buyer? He is liable to give him only the <b>value of the seeds</b> themselves, <b>but not the expenses</b> that the buyer incurred in planting them, e.g., the hire of laborers. <b>And some say:</b> He is liable to give him <b>even the expenses</b> that the buyer incurred.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who is</b> the <i>tanna</i> whose opinion is cited as: <b>Some say? Rav Ḥisda said</b> that <b>it is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>
The Gemara clarifies: From <b>which</b> statement of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> is it apparent that he holds the seller is liable for the buyer’s expenses? One possibility is <b>if we say</b> that the statement in question is that of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel in the mishna, as we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One who sells to another produce</b> that is sometimes purchased for consumption and sometimes for planting, <b>and</b> the buyer <b>planted it and it did not sprout, and even</b> if he had sold <b>flaxseeds,</b> which are only occasionally eaten, the seller <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for them.</b> The Gemara extrapolates: By inference, if this <i>tanna</i> holds that he had sold <b>seeds</b> for <b>garden</b> plants, <b>which are not eaten</b> at all, then the seller <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> to compensate the buyer <b>for them.</b>
The Gemara continues: But accordingly, <b>say the latter clause: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If he had sold <b>seeds</b> for <b>garden</b> plants, <b>which are not eaten</b> at all, then the seller <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for them.</b> The Gemara asks: But according to the inference made from the first clause, <b>the first <i>tanna</i> is also saying this,</b> as he holds that it is only for the sale of <b>flaxseeds that</b> the seller <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> to compensate the buyer <b>for them,</b> but with regard to the sale of <b>seeds</b> for <b>garden</b> plants, <b>which are not eaten</b> at all, the seller <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for them.</b> What, then, is the dispute between the first <i>tanna</i> and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel?
The Gemara therefore suggests: <b>Rather, is it not</b> that the differ-ence <b>between them</b> is whether the seller is liable for the buyer’s <b>expenses?</b> One <b>Sage,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that the seller is liable only for the <b>value of</b> the <b>seeds, and</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> i.e., Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds</b> that the seller is liable <b>even</b> for the buyer’s <b>expenses.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it apparent that it is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel who holds that the seller is liable for the expenses? <b>Perhaps</b> it is <b>the opposite,</b> i.e., it is the first <i>tanna</i> who holds that the seller is liable for the expenses, and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds that he is liable only for the value of the seeds. The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>This</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> because <b>the last <i>tanna</i></b> cited <b>always comes to add something</b> to the ruling of the first <i>tanna</i>, not to detract from it.
The Gemara suggests: <b>But perhaps all of</b> the mishna <b>is</b> stating the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and</b> the mishna <b>is incomplete, and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> With regard to <b>one who sells produce to another</b> that is sometimes purchased for eating and sometimes for planting, <b>and</b> the buyer <b>planted it and it did not sprout,</b> and <b>even</b> if he had sold <b>flaxseeds,</b> which are only occasionally eaten, the seller <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for them.</b> But if he sold <b>seeds</b> for <b>garden</b> plants, <b>which are not eaten</b> at all, the seller <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for them.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says</b> that <b>it is</b> only for the sale of <b>flaxseeds that</b> the seller <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility</b> to compensate the buyer <b>for them,</b> but by inference, for the sale of <b>seeds</b> for <b>garden</b> plants, <b>which are not eaten</b> at all, the seller <b>bears</b> financial <b>responsibility for them.</b> Interpreted in this way, there is no evidence from the mishna that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds that the seller is liable for the expenses.
<b>Rather,</b> the statement in question is <b>this</b> statement of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Kamma</i> 10:9) In a case of <b>one who brought wheat</b> to a miller <b>to grind, and</b> the miller <b>did not wet</b> the grains sufficiently for the grinding to be performed effectively, <b>and</b> as a result <b>he converted</b> the grain <b>into bran or coarse bran [<i>mursan</i>],</b> or in a case of one who gave <b>flour to the baker and</b> the baker <b>made it</b> into <b>bread</b> that is <b>underbaked</b> and tends to crumble, or if one gave <b>an animal to a butcher and</b> the butcher killed it in a way that <b>rendered it</b> an unslaughtered <b>animal carcass,</b> in all these cases the worker is <b>liable, because he is like a paid bailee.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> If the owner had invited guests to eat the food and due to the worker’s actions he was unable to serve them, then the worker must <b>give him compensation for his humiliation and compensation for the humiliation of his guests. And similarly, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel would say: There was a great custom in Jerusalem</b> that if <b>one gives</b> raw materials for <b>a meal to another</b> to prepare the meal for him, <b>and</b> that person <b>spoils it,</b> that person <b>gives</b> the former <b>compensation for his humiliation and compensation for the humiliation of his guests.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Another great custom</b> that <b>was</b> followed <b>in Jerusalem</b> was that when one made a feast, there would be <b>a cloth [<i>mappa</i>] spread over the entrance</b> to the hall. <b>As long as the cloth was spread,</b> the <b>guests would enter,</b> as the presence of the cloth indicated that there was food for more guests. When <b>the cloth was removed, the guests would not enter</b> any more.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> When selling a significant quantity of produce or a number of items, there is a possibility that there will be a certain proportion of impurities in it or that some of the product will be of substandard quality. The mishna delineates what proportion is considered acceptable, for which a buyer may not demand compensation. With regard to <b>one who sells produce,</b> i.e., grain, <b>to another, this</b> buyer <b>accepts upon himself</b> that up to <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of <b>impurities</b> may be present <b>in</b> each <b><i>se’a</i></b> of produce purchased. When purchasing <b>figs, he accepts upon himself</b> that up to <b>ten infested</b> figs may be present <b>in</b> each <b>hundred</b> figs purchased. When purchasing <b>a cellar</b> containing barrels <b>of wine, he accepts upon himself</b> that up to <b>ten</b> barrels of <b>souring</b> wine may be present <b>in</b> each <b>hundred</b> barrels purchased. When purchasing <b>jugs</b> of wine <b>in the Sharon</b> region, <b>he accepts upon himself</b> that up to <b>ten inferior-quality jugs [<i>pitasot</i>]</b> of wine may be present <b>in</b> each <b>hundred</b> jugs purchased.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Ketina taught:</b> When the mishna states that a buyer accepts upon himself that a quarter-<i>kav</i> of impurities per <i>se’a</i> may be present, that means only that he accepts upon himself the presence of <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of legumes,</b> but he does not accept upon himself the presence of a quarter-<i>kav</i> of dirt. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that the buyer does <b>not</b> also accept upon himself that some quantity of <b>dirt</b> might be present in the produce? <b>But doesn’t Rabba bar Ḥiyya Ketosfa’a say in the name of Rabba:</b> One who <b>picks out a pebble from</b> the wheat on <b>another’s threshing floor</b>

Daf 94a

must <b>give him the value of wheat</b> of equal volume to the pebble that he removed. Had he not removed the pebble, the owner would have sold his wheat together with the pebble, all for the price of wheat. Accordingly, the removal of the pebble effectively caused the owner a small loss. It is apparent from this ruling that when selling produce, a buyer accepts upon himself that a quantity of dirt may be mixed in.
The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>legumes,</b> one accepts <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>, but with regard to <b>dirt,</b> he accepts <b>less than a quarter-</b><i>kav</i>.
<b>And</b> is so that he does <b>not</b> accept <b>a quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> of <b>dirt? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who sells produce to another,</b> if he sells him <b>wheat,</b> the buyer <b>accepts upon himself</b> that <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of legumes</b> may be present <b>in</b> each <b><i>se’a</i></b> of wheat purchased. When purchasing <b>barley, he accepts upon himself</b> that <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of <b>chaff</b> may be present <b>in</b> each <b><i>se’a</i></b> purchased. When purchasing <b>lentils, he accepts upon himself</b> that <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of dirt</b> may be present <b>in</b> each <b><i>se’a</i></b> purchased.
The Gemara asks: <b>What, is it not</b> that just as the <i>baraita</i> rules with regard to lentils, <b>the same is true for wheat and for barley?</b> The Gemara answers: No, <b>lentils are different, because they are dug up</b> from the ground and dirt can easily get mixed in. Lentils often contain a higher percentage of dirt than do wheat and barley, which are harvested rather than dug up.
The Gemara suggests: <b>But</b> according to this, <b>the</b> only <b>reason</b> that a buyer accepts that dirt may be present in lentils but not in wheat and barley is <b>that lentils are dug up</b> from the ground, <b>whereas wheat and barley</b> are <b>not.</b> If so, <b>resolve</b> the dilemma <b>from</b> this <i>baraita</i> and conclude that when purchasing <b>wheat and barley,</b> a buyer <b>does not accept</b> that a quarter-<i>kav</i> of <b>dirt</b> may be present in each <i>se’a</i>.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>Actually,</b> perhaps when purchasing <b>wheat and barley</b> as well, a buyer <b>accepts</b> that a quarter-<i>kav</i> of <b>dirt</b> may be present in each <i>se’a</i>, but <b>it was necessary for</b> the <i>baraita</i> to state the <i>halakha</i> specifically with regard to <b>lentils.</b> This is <b>because</b> it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> lentils <b>are dug up</b> from the ground, the buyer would <b>also accept</b> even <b>more than a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of dirt. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.
§ <b>Rav Huna says: If</b> the buyer <b>comes to sift</b> the produce to check if there is more than the acceptable proportion of impurities and he finds that there is too much, <b>he sifts all of it</b> and returns all the impurities to the seller, not just the amount in excess of a quarter-<i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>. The seller must instead provide produce that is free of any impurities. <b>Some say</b> that this is the strict <b><i>halakha</i>, and some say</b> that it is <b>a penalty.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>Some say</b> that this is the strict <b><i>halakha</i>,</b> as <b>one who gives money</b> for produce <b>gives</b> it <b>for good-quality produce</b> containing no impurities at all. Even so, where there is just <b>a quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> of impurities per <i>se’a</i>, <b>a person will not take the trouble</b> to sift the grain to remove the impurities; instead, he accepts the small quantity of impurities that are present. By contrast, where there is <b>more than a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of impurities per <i>se’a</i>, <b>a person will take the trouble</b> to sift the grain to remove the impurities, <b>and once he takes the trouble</b> to sift the grain, he does not stop once he reduces the proportion of impurities to a quarter-<i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>; rather, <b>he takes the trouble</b> to sift <b>all of it.</b> Accordingly, once he has sifted out the impurities, he never agrees to accept any quantity of impurities, and so the seller must take back all the impurities.
<b>And some say</b> it is <b>a penalty.</b> They understand that it is <b>usual</b> for <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of impurities to be present in each <i>se’a</i> of produce, and so it is presumed that a buyer accepts that quantity. <b>More</b> than a quarter-<i>kav</i> <b>is unusual, and</b> consequently the seller is suspected of having deceitfully <b>mixed</b> additional impurities into the produce that he sold. <b>And since</b> the seller deceitfully <b>mixed</b> in impurities, <b>the Sages penalized him</b> by requiring him to pay for <b>all of</b> the impurities present, even those which he did not add.
The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the cases it will cite: <b>All two documents of Ravin bar Rav Naḥman</b> are <b>exploitation and a contract.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Huna’s ruling from a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 2:1): With regard to <b>any <i>se’a</i></b> of seeds <b>that contains a quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> or more of seeds <b>of a different kind,</b> before sowing such seeds <b>one must reduce</b> the quantity of the other kind of seeds in the mixture so as not to violate the prohibition against growing a mixture of diverse kinds (see Leviticus 19:19). The Gemara explains: It can be <b>assumed that</b> the presence of <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of seeds of a different kind per <i>se’a</i> <b>with regard to</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds is as</b> problematic as <b>more than a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of impurities per <i>se’a</i> <b>with regard to</b> a sale, as discussed <b>here, and</b> therefore, since the mishna <b>teaches</b> with regard to diverse kinds only that <b>one must reduce</b> the additional amount, but not that one is required to remove all the seeds of a different kind, it follows that the same is true in the case of a sale, and the seller should not have to take back all of the impurities. This contradicts Rav Huna’s ruling.
The Gemara deflects the challenge: <b>No,</b> this assumption is not necessarily correct; perhaps the presence of <b>a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of seeds of a different kind per <i>se’a</i> <b>with regard to diverse kinds is comparable to a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of impurities per <i>se’a</i> <b>with regard to</b> a sale, as discussed <b>here,</b> and both are considered acceptable levels of admixture.
The Gemara asks: <b>If</b> it is <b>so</b> that a quarter-<i>kav</i> of seeds of a different kind per <i>se’a</i> is acceptable, <b>why</b> does the mishna teach that <b>one must reduce</b> the quantity of seeds of a different kind? The Gemara answers: The requirement is a rabbinic decree <b>due to the severity of</b> the prohibition of <b>diverse kinds.</b>
The Gemara challenges this answer: <b>If so,</b>

Daf 94b

<b>say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> It is insufficient to merely reduce the quantity of seeds of a different kind; rather, <b>one must pick out</b> all the seeds of a different kind.
The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that a quarter-<i>kav</i> of seeds of a different kind per <i>se’a</i> with regard to diverse kinds <b>is comparable to more than a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>of impurities</b> per <i>se’a</i> with regard to a sale, then it is <b>about this that they disagree: The first <i>tanna</i> holds that we do not penalize</b> one by requiring him to remove <b>that which is permitted due to that which is prohibited,</b> and consequently it is sufficient to merely reduce the quantity of seeds of a different kind to an acceptable level, <b>whereas Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b>we</b> do <b>penalize</b> one by requiring him to remove that which is permitted due to that which is prohibited. <b>But if you say</b> that a quarter-<i>kav</i> of seeds of a different kind per <i>se’a</i> with regard to diverse kinds <b>is comparable to a quarter-</b><i>kav</i> of impurities per <i>se’a</i> with regard to a sale, then <b>why</b> does Rabbi Yosei rule that <b>one must pick out</b> all the seeds of a different kind?
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> with regard to diverse kinds, <b>this is the reasoning of Rabbi Yosei:</b> One must pick out all the seeds, <b>because</b> once he is purifying the admixture of seeds, if he deliberately leaves a quantity of seeds of a different kind mixed in, <b>it appears as though he is</b> intentionally planting and <b>maintaining diverse kinds</b> in his field.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another challenge to Rav Huna’s ruling from a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 37a): In the case of <b>two</b> people <b>who deposited</b> money <b>with one</b> person, and <b>this</b> one deposited <b>one hundred dinars and that</b> one deposited <b>two hundred</b> dinars, and when they return to collect their deposits, <b>this</b> one <b>says: My</b> deposit was <b>two hundred</b> dinars, <b>and that</b> one <b>says: My</b> deposit was <b>two hundred</b> dinars, the bailee <b>gives one hundred dinars to this</b> one <b>and one hundred dinars to that</b> one, <b>and the rest</b> of the money, i.e., the contested one hundred dinars, <b>will be placed</b> in a safe place <b>until Elijah comes</b> and prophetically determines the truth. In this case, one of the parties is certainly lying, but nevertheless, the Sages did not penalize the parties by placing all of the money in a safe place. Similarly, in the case of a sale, where a seller deceitfully mixed additional impurities into the produce he sold, he should not be penalized and required to take back all of the impurities.
The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of the deposits, <b>it is certain</b> that at least <b>one hundred dinars</b> belongs <b>to</b> this <b>Master and one hundred dinars</b> belongs <b>to</b> that <b>Master. Here,</b> in the case of a sale where there is an unacceptable proportion of impurities mixed in, <b>who can say that</b> the seller <b>did not mix in the entire</b> amount intentionally? Accordingly, no proof can be drawn from the mishna.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a support for Rav Huna’s ruling <b>from the latter clause</b> of that mishna: <b>Rabbi Yosei says: If so, what did the swindler lose?</b> He lost nothing by claiming the one hundred dinars that belongs to another, and he has no incentive to admit the truth. <b>Rather, the entire</b> deposit <b>will be placed</b> in a safe place <b>until Elijah comes.</b> Since through his lie the swindler risks losing even the one hundred dinars that he deposited, perhaps that will induce him to admit his deceit. According to Rabbi Yosei, the Sages did penalize one who acts deceitfully, which accords with Rav Huna’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of the deposits, <b>there is certainly a swindler,</b> and it is reasonable to penalize both parties in order to induce the swindler to admit his deceit. <b>Here,</b> in the case of a sale where there is an unacceptable level of impurities mixed in with the produce, <b>who can say that</b> the seller intentionally <b>mixed in</b> anything? Perhaps the impurities were inadvertently mixed in during the processing. Accordingly, no proof can be drawn from the mishna.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> another support for Rav Huna’s ruling from a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of a promissory <b>note in which</b> the details of a loan with <b>interest</b> were written, the court <b>penalizes</b> the creditor, <b>and he may collect neither the principal nor the interest;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir.</b> According to Rabbi Meir, the Sages did penalize one who acts improperly, which accords with Rav Huna’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects the proof: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of a loan with interest, it is already <b>at the time of the writing</b> of the bill that the lender <b>performed the</b> transgression of <b>placing</b> interest upon the borrower. Since he certainly committed a transgression, it is reasonable that the Sages penalized him. But <b>here,</b> in the case of a sale where there is an unacceptable proportion of impurities mixed in with the produce, <b>who can say that</b> the seller intentionally <b>mixed in</b> anything? Perhaps the impurities were inadvertently mixed in during the processing. Accordingly, no proof can be drawn from the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a challenge to Rav Huna’s ruling <b>from the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But the Rabbis say: He may collect the principal but may not collect the interest.</b> According to Rabbi Meir, the Sages did not penalize one who acts improperly, contrary to Rav Huna’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects this challenge: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of a loan with interest, according to strict <i>halakha</i> it <b>is certainly permitted</b> to collect <b>the principal,</b> so the Sages did not penalize him with regard to it. But <b>here,</b> in the case of a sale where there is an unacceptable proportion of impurities mixed in, <b>who can say that</b> the seller <b>did not mix in the entire</b> amount intentionally? Accordingly, no proof can be drawn from the mishna.
<b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> further support for Rav Huna’s ruling from <b>that</b> which <b>Ravin bar Rav Naḥman teaches</b> (104b). Ravin bar Rav Naḥman’s statement is with regard to a situation when land that was sold is later found to be larger than stated at the time of the sale. If the deviation is not more than an area required to sow a quarter-<i>kav</i> of seed per <i>beit se’a</i> of land, then the buyer need not return any land to the seller. If the proportion of extra land is larger than this, <b>not only must</b> the buyer <b>return the extra</b> land that is beyond the limit of a quarter-<i>kav</i> area per <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>but he must</b> also <b>return to him every one of the</b> extra <b>quarter-</b><i>kav</i> areas of land that he received beyond the stated area of a <i>beit kor</i>. The Gemara infers: <b>Apparently, when one is required to return</b> part of a sale because of a discrepancy that is beyond the acceptable limit of deviation, then <b>one is required to return</b> the <b>entire</b> discrepancy and not just the amount that is beyond the acceptable limit. This supports Rav Huna’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared?</b>

Daf 95a

<b>There,</b> in the case of the sale of land, the reason the buyer may keep the extra land when it is less than the acceptable limit is that the seller <b>said to him:</b> I am selling you this piece of land <b>whether it is</b> slightly <b>less or</b> slightly <b>more</b> than a <i>beit kor</i>, i.e., he agrees to accept a small deviation from the stated area. <b>But</b> while an extra <b>quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> area per <i>beit se’a</i> is <b>not significant,</b> and therefore the seller is willing to forgo it, <b>more than a quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> area per <i>beit se’a</i> <b>is significant,</b> and the seller is not willing to forgo any of it. Consequently, all of the extra land must be returned. By contrast, in the case of Rav Huna’s ruling, the buyer is aware that it is normal to have a certain proportion of impurities mixed in and accepts this possibility from the outset. Accordingly, even if the proportion of impurities is greater than the acceptable limit, it might be sufficient if the seller takes back only the quantity of impurities above the acceptable limit.
The Gemara explains why more than an area required to sow a quarter-<i>kav</i> of seed per <i>beit se’a</i> of land is significant: The reason is <b>that since</b> all those extra areas of land <b>are fit to combine together to</b> form an area in which one could sow <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed, the extra land <b>is a significant plot of land in its own right, and</b> therefore <b>it must</b> all <b>be returned.</b> The land that was sold was stated to be a <i>beit kor</i>, which is thirty <i>beit se’a</i>. If the area of the extra land was of a proportion somewhat more than an area required to sow a quarter-<i>kav</i> of seed per <i>beit se’a</i> of land, then thirty such areas would collectively be about equal to an area required to sow nine <i>kav</i>.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a support for Rav Huna’s ruling from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>The</b> <i>halakha</i> of price <b>exploitation</b> is that if the disparity is <b>less than one-sixth</b> of the value of the merchandise, the <b>merchandise is acquired</b> immediately and the sum of the exploitation need not be returned. If the disparity is <b>greater than one-sixth,</b> then <b>the transaction is nullified.</b> If the disparity is precisely <b>one-sixth,</b> the buyer has <b>acquired</b> the merchandise, <b>and</b> the one who benefited from the exploitation <b>returns</b> the entire sum of the <b>exploitation.</b>
The Gemara explains the proof: <b>Why,</b> in the case where the disparity is precisely one-sixth, is the entire sum of the exploitation returned? Instead, <b>let him return</b> only a small amount of the exploitation <b>until</b> the difference is <b>less than one-sixth.</b> The Gemara concludes: <b>Learn from</b> the fact that he must return the entire sum that <b>when one is required to return</b> part of a sale because of a discrepancy that is beyond the acceptable limit of deviation, <b>one is required to return</b> the <b>entire</b> discrepancy and not just the amount that is beyond the acceptable limit. This supports Rav Huna’s ruling.
The Gemara rejects this: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of exploitation, the seller <b>initially said to</b> the buyer that he would sell the merchandise for a sum <b>equal to its value.</b> Any price difference should be unacceptable. <b>But</b> a disparity of <b>less than one-sixth is not recognizable in</b> a sale worth <b>one hundred dinars, and a person</b> will <b>forgo</b> it. By contrast, a disparity of <b>one-sixth is considered</b> significant, <b>and a person will not forgo</b> it. Consequently, the entire sum of the exploitation must be returned. If the disparity is <b>greater than one-sixth, it is a mistaken transaction and the transaction is nullified.</b> By contrast, in the case of Rav Huna’s ruling, the buyer is aware that it is normal to have a certain proportion of impurities mixed in and accepted that possibility from the outset. Accordingly, even if the proportion of impurities was greater than the acceptable limit, it might be sufficient if the seller takes back only the quantity of impurities above the acceptable limit.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a support for Rav Huna’s ruling from a <i>baraita</i>: When <b>one receives a field from another</b> under a contract <b>to plant</b> trees in it, then <b>this</b> field owner <b>accepts upon himself</b> that there may be <b>ten deficient trees per</b> every <b>hundred</b> trees planted, as he is aware that not every tree planted will necessarily flourish. If the number of deficient trees is <b>more than this,</b> the court <b>imposes upon him</b> the responsibility to replace <b>all</b> of those trees, and not only the number of trees above the acceptable limit. This supports Rav Huna’s ruling.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> There is no proof from this case, because <b>any</b> time there are <b>more than this</b> number of deficient trees, the overall area that contains the deficient trees is of a size equivalent to a whole field. Therefore, the contractor is <b>comparable to one who comes to plant</b> a whole field <b>from the outset,</b> who has not fulfilled his remit if he plants only a few trees; rather, he must plant the entire area. But in the case of Rav Huna’s ruling, the impurities never constitute an independent unit; consequently, it might be sufficient if the seller takes back only the quantity of impurities that is above the acceptable limit.
§ The mishna teaches: When purchasing <b>a cellar</b> containing barrels <b>of wine,</b> one accepts upon himself that up to ten barrels of souring wine may be present in each hundred barrels purchased. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the sale? <b>If</b> one <b>said to</b> the buyer: I am selling to you <b>a wine cellar, with-out specification</b> of which cellar he meant, it is <b>difficult,</b> as the Gemara will soon explain. And <b>if he said to him:</b> I am selling to you <b>this</b> particular <b>wine cellar,</b> it is <b>difficult.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>If he said to him:</b> I am selling to you <b>this</b> particular wine <b>cellar,</b> it is <b>difficult, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If one said to a buyer: <b>I am selling to you a wine cellar,</b> then he is required to <b>give him wine that is all</b> of <b>good</b> quality, i.e., the buyer does not have to accept any quantity of souring wine. If he said: <b>I am selling to you this</b> particular <b>wine cellar,</b> then he may <b>give him</b> the <b>wine</b> that is in his possession, even if it is of the quality <b>that is sold in the shops,</b> i.e., it is beginning to sour. If he said: <b>I am selling to you this</b> particular <b>cellar,</b> without mentioning the word: Wine, then <b>even</b> if <b>everything</b> he gives him is wine that had turned into <b>vinegar, it has come to</b> the buyer and the sale is valid. The mishna’s ruling that the buyer must accept that up to ten percent of the wine might be souring does not accord with any of the rulings of the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna concerns a case <b>when he said to</b> the buyer: I am selling to you <b>a wine cellar, without specification</b> of which cellar he was selling. <b>And</b> emend the <i>baraita</i> and <b>teach</b> the following qualification <b>in the first clause of the <i>baraita</i>: And</b> the buyer <b>accepts upon himself</b> that up to <b>ten</b> barrels of <b>souring</b> wine may be present <b>in</b> each <b>hundred</b> barrels purchased.
The Gemara challenges this addition: <b>But</b> if he sold the buyer a wine cellar <b>without specification</b> of which one he was selling, <b>does</b> the buyer <b>accept</b> upon himself any souring wine at all? <b>Didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach: One who sells a barrel of wine to another</b> must <b>give him wine that is all</b> of <b>good</b> quality? The Gemara answers: <b>A barrel is different, because</b> the wine inside <b>is all one</b> body of <b>wine</b> of the same quality.
The Gemara once again challenges the addition: <b>But didn’t Rav Zevid teach</b> a <i>baraita</i> of the <b>school of Rabbi Oshaya:</b> If one says to a buyer: <b>I am selling to you a wine cellar,</b> then he is required to <b>give him wine that is all</b> of <b>good</b> quality? Similarly, if he said: <b>I am selling to you this</b> particular <b>wine cellar,</b> then he is required to <b>give him wine that is all</b> of <b>good</b> quality, but the buyer <b>accepts upon himself ten souring</b> barrels <b>per hundred</b> barrels.

Daf 95b

Rav Zevid concludes: <b>And this is</b> the case of the <b>storeroom,</b> i.e., the cellar, <b>that the Sages taught in the mishna.</b> It is clear from this <i>baraita</i> both that it contradicts the suggested addition to the previous <i>baraita</i>, and that the mishna concerns a case where one specified which wine cellar he was selling.
<b>Rather,</b> as indicated by the <i>baraita</i>, <b>the mishna also</b> concerns a case where one <b>says to</b> the buyer: I am selling you <b>this</b> particular cellar, and because he specified a particular cellar the buyer accepts upon himself the possibility that up to ten barrels per hundred might be sour.
Having retracted the addition to the first <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara asks: If so, it is <b>difficult</b> to reconcile the first <i>baraita</i>, which rules that if the seller specified that he was selling <b>this</b> cellar, he must provide wine that is all of good quality, with the second <i>baraita</i>, that of Rav Zevid, which rules with regard to the same case, in which the seller specified he was selling <b>this</b> cellar, that the buyer accepts that up to ten barrels per hundred may contain souring wine.
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the buyer <b>said to him</b> that he needs the wine <b>for cooking,</b> and therefore he requires good-quality wine, whereas <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case where the buyer did <b>not say to him</b> that he needs the wine <b>for cooking.</b> The Gemara elaborates: The second <i>baraita</i>, taught by <b>Rav Zevid,</b> is referring to a case where the buyer <b>said</b> that he needs the wine <b>for cooking,</b> whereas the first <b><i>baraita</i></b> is referring to a case where the buyer did <b>not say to him</b> that he requires it <b>for cooking.</b>
The Gemara concludes: <b>Therefore,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that if one said that he is selling: <b>A wine cellar, and</b> the buyer <b>said to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking,</b> then the seller is obligated to <b>give him wine that is all</b> of <b>good</b> quality. If one said that he is selling: <b>This</b> particular <b>wine cellar, and</b> the buyer <b>said to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking,</b> then the seller is obligated to <b>give him wine that is all</b> of <b>good</b> quality, but the buyer <b>accepts upon himself ten</b> barrels of <b>souring</b> wine <b>in</b> each <b>hundred</b> barrels purchased. If one said that he is selling: <b>This</b> particular <b>wine cellar,</b> and the buyer <b>did not say to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking,</b> then the seller may <b>give to him</b> the <b>wine</b> that is in his possession, even if it is of a quality <b>that is sold in the shops,</b> i.e., it is beginning to sour.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one said that he is selling: <b>A wine cellar, and</b> the buyer <b>did not say to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Aḥa and Ravina disagree about this. One says:</b> The buyer <b>must accept</b> ten barrels of souring wine per hundred, <b>and</b> the other <b>one says:</b> The buyer <b>need not accept</b> any barrels of souring wine.
The Gemara explains their reasoning. <b>The one who says</b> that the buyer <b>must accept</b> ten barrels of souring wine per hundred <b>infers</b> this <b>though</b> a precise reading of the <i>baraita</i> <b>of Rav Zevid, as it teaches:</b> If one says: <b>I am selling to you a wine cellar,</b> then he is required to <b>give him wine that is all</b> of <b>good</b> quality. <b>And we interpreted</b> this <i>baraita</i> as referring to a case <b>where</b> the buyer <b>said to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking.</b> The Gemara explains the inference: <b>The</b> only <b>reason</b> that he must provide him with wine that is all of good quality is <b>that</b> the buyer <b>said to him</b> that he needed it <b>for cooking.</b> By inference, where the buyer <b>does not say to him:</b> I need it <b>for cooking,</b> the buyer <b>must accept</b> ten barrels of souring wine per hundred.
<b>And the one who says</b> that the buyer <b>need not accept</b> any barrels of souring wine <b>infers</b> this <b>through</b> a precise reading <b>of</b> the first <b><i>baraita</i>, as it teaches:</b> If one says: <b>I am selling to you a wine cellar,</b> then he is required to <b>give him wine that is all</b> of <b>good</b> quality. <b>And we interpreted</b> this <i>baraita</i> as referring to a case <b>where he did not say to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking,</b> and even so, the buyer need not accept any barrels of souring wine.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then, <b>according to the one who infers</b> his opinion <b>through</b> a precise reading of the <i>baraita</i> <b>of Rav Zevid, the</b> first <b><i>baraita</i></b> poses <b>a difficulty.</b> The Gemara answers that according to his opinion, the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> If one says: I am selling to you a cellar of wine, then he is required to give him wine that is all of good quality. <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said in a case <b>where</b> the buyer <b>said to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking.</b> By inference, where the buyer <b>did not say to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking,</b> the buyer <b>must accept</b> ten barrels of souring wine per hundred. <b>And</b> if one said that he is selling: <b>This</b> particular <b>wine cellar, and</b> the buyer <b>did not say to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking,</b> then one may <b>give to him</b> the <b>wine</b> that is in his possession, even if it is of a quality <b>that is sold in the shops,</b> i.e., it is beginning to sour.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who infers</b> his opinion <b>through</b> a precise reading of the first <b><i>baraita</i>,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>of Rav Zevid</b> poses <b>a difficulty, as we interpreted it</b> as referring to a case <b>where</b> the buyer <b>said to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking.</b> And this opinion inferred that if the buyer <b>did not say to him:</b> I need it <b>for cooking,</b> then the buyer <b>must accept</b> ten barrels of souring wine per hundred.
The Gemara answers: <b>The same is true</b> according to both <i>baraitot</i>, <b>that even where</b> the buyer <b>did not say to him:</b> I need the wine <b>for cooking,</b> the buyer <b>need not accept</b> ten barrels of souring wine. <b>And</b> there is no proof from the fact <b>that we interpreted</b> the <i>baraita</i> as referring to a case <b>where he said to him:</b> I need it <b>for cooking,</b> since we did so only <b>due to the difficulty</b> of the contradiction between the ruling of the first <i>baraita</i> in the case where the seller specified that he was selling <b>this</b> cellar and the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> of Rav Zevid in the same case where the seller specified he was selling <b>this</b> cellar. Due to that difficulty, the entire <i>baraita</i> was interpreted as referring to a case where the buyer said: I need the wine for cooking, despite the fact that in the case where he did not mention a specific cellar it makes no difference whether or not he said so.
§ Apropos wine that is sold in the shops, the Gemara considers additional <i>halakhot</i> pertaining to such wine: <b>Rav Yehuda says: Over wine</b> of the same quality as that <b>which is sold in the shops, one recites the</b> standard <b>blessing</b> for wine: <b>Who creates fruit of the vine.</b> Despite the fact that such wine is not of the highest quality, it is still regarded as wine. <b>And Rav Ḥisda said: Over wine that has formed a film</b> as it begins to sour, <b>why do I</b> need to recite the blessing for wine? Since it has begun to sour, it is no longer regarded as wine. Instead, one should recite the generic blessing recited over foods of lower importance: By Whose word all things came to be.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Yehuda’s opinion. It is taught in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Over bread that has become moldy, and over wine that has formed a film, and over a cooked dish that has spoiled, one recites</b> the blessing: <b>By Whose word all things came to be.</b> Since these foods have partially spoiled, it is inappropriate to recite the specific blessings designated for such foods in their fresh state.
<b>Rav Zevid said: Rav Yehuda concedes</b> that one does not recite the blessing of: Who creates fruit of the vine, <b>on wine made from grape seeds that is sold on the</b> street <b>corners.</b> It is to such significantly inferior wine that the <i>baraita</i> refers. Wine sold in the shops still has the taste and appearance of wine, so one should recite the standard blessing for wine.
<b>Abaye said to Rav Yosef: This</b> is the opinion of <b>Rav Yehuda,</b> and <b>this</b> is the opinion of <b>Rav Ḥisda. In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>does the Master hold?</b> Rav Yosef <b>said to him: I know a <i>baraita</i></b> from which it is possible to derive the <i>halakha</i>.

Daf 96a

<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Terumot</i> 2:8): With regard to <b>one who inspects a barrel</b> to see if it still contains enough wine <b>to continually</b> mentally <b>separate <i>teruma</i> from it</b> to exempt other untithed wine he has, until all the wine in that barrel would be <i>teruma</i> and would be given to a priest, <b>and afterward</b> the contents of the barrel <b>were found</b> to have turned to <b>vinegar,</b> which cannot be set aside as <i>teruma</i> for untithed wine, then <b>all three days</b> after he had last inspected it, it is <b>definitely</b> viewed as having been wine, and any wine for which <i>teruma</i> was separated during those days is tithed. <b>From that</b> point <b>onward,</b> more than three days after the previous inspection, it is <b>uncertain</b> as to whether it had already turned to vinegar, and any wine for which <i>teruma</i> was separated during those days is not tithed.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>saying? Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>this</b> is what it <b>is saying:</b> For <b>all</b> of <b>the first three days</b> following the inspection, it is <b>definitely</b> viewed as having been <b>wine</b> that had not yet turned to vinegar. <b>From that</b> point <b>onward,</b> it is <b>uncertain</b> as to whether it had already turned to vinegar. Accordingly, any wine for which <i>teruma</i> was separated after those three days by means of designating the contents of that barrel as <i>teruma</i> has an uncertain status.
<b>What is the reason?</b> The process in which <b>wine turns sour</b> and becomes vinegar starts <b>with</b> the wine at the <b>top</b> of the barrel; <b>and</b> it is <b>that</b> wine which <b>he tasted</b> when he inspected it, <b>and</b> at that time <b>it had not</b> yet <b>soured.</b> And even <b>if you say</b> that immediately <b>after he tasted it</b> the wine began to <b>sour,</b> during the following three days <b>it</b> would <b>have the odor of vinegar and its taste</b> would be <b>of wine, and anything</b> that <b>has an odor of vinegar but its taste is of wine</b> is regarded as <b>wine.</b>
<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says</b> that there is a different interpretation of the <i>baraita</i>: For <b>all</b> of <b>the last three days</b> preceding the discovery that the wine had turned into vinegar, it is <b>definitely</b> viewed as having been <b>vinegar. From that</b> point and <b>earlier,</b> until the time it had been inspected, it is <b>uncertain</b> whether or not it was wine or vinegar.
<b>What is the reason?</b> The process in which <b>wine turns sour</b> and becomes vinegar starts <b>with</b> the wine at the <b>bottom</b> of the barrel, <b>and</b> therefore, since the inspection was limited to the wine at the top of the barrel, it is possible to <b>say</b> that wine at the bottom <b>had</b> already started to <b>sour and one was unaware of it.</b> Consequently, it is possible that on the day he tasted it the wine turned entirely into vinegar. <b>And</b> even <b>if you say</b> that the process in which <b>wine turns sour</b> and becomes vinegar starts <b>with</b> the wine at the <b>top</b> of the barrel, <b>and</b> it is <b>that</b> wine that <b>he tasted</b> when he inspected it <b>and</b> at that time <b>it had not</b> yet <b>soured, perhaps</b> immediately <b>after he tasted it</b> the wine began to <b>sour,</b> in which case <b>its odor</b> would be <b>of vinegar and its taste of wine, and</b> anything that <b>has an odor of vinegar but its taste is of wine</b> is regarded as <b>vinegar.</b>
The Sages <b>of the South taught</b> another interpretation of the <i>baraita</i> <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi:</b> For the <b>first</b> three days it is <b>definitely</b> viewed as having been <b>wine.</b> For the <b>last</b> three days it is <b>definitely</b> viewed as having been <b>vinegar.</b> The status of the wine during the <b>intervening</b> period is <b>uncertain.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>This matter itself</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as, since <b>you said</b> that for the <b>first</b> three days it is <b>definitely</b> viewed as having been <b>wine; apparently,</b> if <b>it has the odor of vinegar but its taste is of wine</b> it is regarded as <b>wine. But then you said</b> that for the <b>last</b> three days it is <b>definitely</b> viewed as having been <b>vinegar; apparently,</b> if <b>it has the odor of vinegar but its taste is of wine</b> it is regarded as <b>vinegar,</b> as it can be established only that the odor had changed three days ago.
The Gemara resolves the difficulty: The Sages of the South hold that as long as the wine still tastes like wine, it is regarded as wine. When they said that when a barrel is found to contain vinegar it is certain that the wine had already turned into vinegar three days previously, they were referring to a case <b>where</b> the barrel <b>was found</b> to contain <b>strong vinegar, as, had it not</b> already <b>soured three days</b> previously, the barrel <b>would not have been found</b> to contain <b>strong vinegar;</b> rather, it would contain only mild vinegar.
Rav Yosef claimed that this <i>baraita</i> can serve as proof with regard to which blessing is recited over wine that has the odor of vinegar but tastes like wine. Having cited three different interpretations of the <i>baraita</i>, the Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with</b> whose interpretation did Rav Yosef <b>resolve</b> the question of which blessing to recite? <b>Rav Mari and Rav Zevid disagree about it. One said</b> that Rav Yosef resolved it <b>in accordance with</b> the interpretation of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> that this liquid is regarded as wine and the blessing for wine should be recited over it. <b>And one said</b> that Rav Yosef resolved it <b>in accordance with</b> the interpretation of <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi,</b> that the liquid is regarded as vinegar and the generic blessing: By Whose word all things came to be, should be recited over it. There is no definitive resolution of the dispute.
§ An amoraic dispute <b>was stated</b> with regard to <b>one who sells a barrel of wine to another, and</b> following the sale <b>it turned to vinegar. Rav said:</b> If it soured during <b>any of the first three days</b> following the sale, it is presumed that it had already began to sour <b>in the domain of</b> the <b>seller,</b> and he bears financial responsibility for it; <b>from that</b> point <b>onward,</b> it is presumed that the wine soured <b>in the domain of</b> the <b>buyer,</b> and it is his loss.

Daf 96b

<b>And Shmuel said:</b> Even if the wine sours shortly after the purchase, the seller does not bear responsibility, as <b>the wine is agitated</b> as it is carried <b>upon the shoulders of its</b> new <b>owner,</b> causing it to sour quickly.
<b>Rav Yosef ruled</b> in an actual <b>case in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav, in</b> which <b>beer</b> spoiled shortly after it was sold, <b>and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel in</b> a similar case involving <b>wine. And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Shmuel.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Whether</b> one drinks <b>date beer, or barley beer, or</b> a beverage made from soaking <b>pomace</b> from the production of <b>wine</b> in water, known as <i>tamad</i>, <b>one recites over them the blessing: By Whose word all things came to be. <i>Aḥerim</i> say: Over</b> wine made from <b>pomace that has the taste of wine</b> one <b>recites the blessing: Who creates fruit of the vine. Rabba and Rav Yosef both say: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>.</b>
<b>Rava said:</b> According to the opinions <b>of everyone</b> mentioned in the <i>baraita</i>, if <b>one poured three</b> jugs of water over grape pomace <b>and</b> then, after removing the pomace, the volume of the resulting beverage <b>came to four</b> jugs, then that beverage <b>is</b> regarded as <b>wine.</b> Evidently, a quarter of the resulting beverage is from juice that was contained in the pomace, which is pure wine, and that is a sufficient ratio for the beverage as a whole to be regarded as wine. The Gemara interjects Rava’s comments: With this statement, <b>Rava</b> conforms <b>to his</b> standard line of <b>reasoning, as Rava said: Any wine that does not contain three</b> parts <b>water to one</b> part pure wine <b>is not</b> regarded as <b>wine,</b> as it is excessively strong.
Rava continues: If <b>one poured three</b> jugs of water over pomace, <b>and</b> the volume of the resulting beverage still <b>came to three</b> jugs, then <b>it is nothing,</b> i.e., it is not regarded as wine. <b>When</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>disagree</b> is in a case <b>where one poured three</b> jugs of water over pomace <b>and</b> the volume of the resulting beverage <b>came to three and a half</b> jugs, <b>as the Rabbis,</b> i.e., the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>hold</b> that <b>three</b> jugs of water <b>were absorbed into</b> the pomace and then the same <b>three</b> jugs of water <b>seeped out</b> of the pomace; therefore, there <b>remains half</b> a jug of the resulting beverage that was originally pure wine contained in the pomace. <b>But half</b> a jug of pure wine mixed <b>into six half-</b>jugs of <b>water is nothing,</b> i.e., the mixture is too weak to be regarded as wine.
<b>And <i>Aḥerim</i> hold</b> that <b>three</b> jugs of water <b>were absorbed into</b> the pomace but only <b>two and a half</b> jugs of water <b>seeped out</b> of the pomace, as one jug of water replaced the one jug of pure wine contained in the pomace. Therefore, there <b>remains</b> one <b>jug</b> of the resulting beverage that is pure wine that was previously contained in the pomace. <b>And</b> one <b>jug</b> of pure wine mixed <b>into two and a half</b> jugs of water <b>is</b> regarded as <b>full-fledged wine.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And where</b> the volume of the resulting beverage <b>is greater than the amount</b> of water that was poured over the pomace, <b>do</b> the Sages ever <b>disagree? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ma’asrot</i> 5:6):

Daf 97a

In the case of <b>one who produces <i>tamad</i>,</b> a beverage made by steeping grape pomace in water, <b>and he placed a measured</b> amount of <b>water</b> into a container together with the pomace, <b>and</b> after removing the pomace <b>he found</b> that the volume of the <i>tamad</i> produced was <b>equivalent to the amount</b> of water used, one is <b>exempt</b> from the requirement to tithe the <i>tamad</i>, even though the pomace came from grapes that had not been tithed. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda deems</b> one <b>liable</b> to tithe the <i>tamad</i>. The Gemara explains the difficulty posed by this mishna: It would appear that <b>they disagree only with regard to</b> a case <b>where</b> the volume of the <i>tamad</i> produced was <b>equivalent to the amount</b> of water used, <b>but</b> in a case where the volume of the <i>tamad</i> produced was <b>greater than the amount</b> of water used, <b>they do not disagree;</b> rather, they all agree that it must be tithed because it is regarded as wine. This would appear to contradict Rava’s explanation.
The Gemara resolves the difficulty: Actually, <b>the same is true</b> in <b>that they would disagree even where</b> the volume of the <i>tamad</i> produced was <b>greater than the amount</b> of water used. <b>And</b> the reason <b>that</b> the mishna records only that <b>they disagree</b> about a case <b>where</b> the volume of the <i>tamad</i> produced was <b>equivalent to the amount</b> of water used is in order <b>to convey to you the far-reaching nature of</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehuda,</b> who holds that one is liable to tithe the <i>tamad</i> even in this case.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak asked Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin:</b> If one steeps <b>pomace</b> and produces <i>tamad</i> <b>that has the taste of wine, what is</b> the blessing that one should recite before drinking it? Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin <b>said to him: Do you hold</b> that such a beverage <b>is wine? It is merely a sharp-flavored</b> beverage, not wine.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the production of successive batches of <i>tamad</i> of decreasing strengths by reusing the pomace after each time a <i>tamad</i> is produced: With regard to <b>pomace of <i>teruma</i></b> wine, the <b>first and second</b> products are considered to be <i>teruma</i>, and it is <b>prohibited</b> for a non-priest to drink it. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the third</b> product, a non-priest <b>is permitted</b> to drink it. <b>Rabbi Meir says: Even</b> with regard to the <b>third</b> product, if the wine that seeps out of the pomace <b>imparts</b> the <b>flavor</b> of wine to the water, it is forbidden to a non-priest.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> with regard to water added to pomace <b>of</b> second<b>-tithe</b> wine, the <b>first</b> product is also considered to be second tithe, and it is <b>prohibited</b> to drink it outside Jerusalem. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>the second</b> product, it <b>is permitted</b> to drink it anywhere. <b>Rabbi Meir says: Even</b> with regard to the <b>second</b> product, if the wine that seeps out of the pomace <b>imparts</b> the <b>flavor</b> of wine to the water, it may be consumed only in Jerusalem. <b>And</b> with regard to water added to pomace <b>of</b> wine that was <b>consecrated</b> to the Temple, up to the <b>third</b> product it is <b>prohibited</b> to derive any benefit from it, as it is considered to be consecrated, <b>but</b> from <b>the fourth</b> product, it <b>is permitted. Rabbi Meir says: Even</b> with regard to the <b>fourth</b> product, if the wine that seeps out of the pomace <b>imparts</b> the <b>flavor</b> of wine to the water, it is prohibited.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a different <i>baraita</i>: <i>Tamad</i> produced from the pomace <b>of</b> wine that was <b>consecrated</b> to the Temple is <b>always forbidden,</b> even after having steeped them many times, <b>and</b> the beverage produced from pomace <b>of</b> second <b>tithe is always permitted,</b> even from the first such product. The Gemara explains: The ruling concerning <b>consecrated</b> pomace is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted by the ruling of the first <i>baraita</i> concerning <b>consecrated</b> pomace. And the ruling concerning second-<b>tithe</b> pomace is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted by the ruling of the first <i>baraita</i> concerning second-<b>tithe</b> pomace.
The Gemara answers: The contradiction between the ruling of one <i>baraita</i> concerning <b>consecrated</b> pomace and the ruling of the other <i>baraita</i> concerning <b>consecrated</b> pomace is <b>not difficult,</b> as one can explain that <b>here,</b> the second <i>baraita</i> is referring to pomace <b>with inherent sanctity,</b> and <b>there,</b> the first <i>baraita</i> is referring to pomace <b>with sanctity</b> that inheres in its <b>value.</b> Also, the contradiction between the ruling of one <i>baraita</i> concerning pomace of second <b>tithe</b> and the ruling of the other <i>baraita</i> concerning pomace of second <b>tithe</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as one can explain that <b>here,</b> the first <i>baraita</i> is referring to pomace whose status as second <b>tithe</b> is <b>certain</b> and <b>there,</b> the second <i>baraita</i> is referring to pomace <b>of</b> second <b>tithe</b> of <b>doubtfully tithed produce [<i>demai</i>].</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak:</b> In the <b>same way in which</b> the Sages <b>said</b> concerning differing strengths of <i>tamad</i> that <b>with regard to their prohibition,</b> after a certain number of times the <i>tamad</i> produced is not considered to be wine, <b>so</b> too <b>they said</b> the same rulings <b>with regard to their capacity to render</b> foods <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity.
The Gemara asks: When the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>their capacity to render</b> other foods <b>susceptible</b> to ritual impurity, why does it matter <b>which</b> kind of beverage the <i>tamad</i> is considered to be? <b>Whether</b> the <i>tamad</i> is regarded <b>as water</b> it can <b>render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity, or <b>whether</b> it is regarded as <b>wine it</b> can <b>render</b> food <b>susceptible</b> to impurity. The Gemara clarifies: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case in <b>which one produced <i>tamad</i> with rainwater</b> that he had not previously intended to use. Rainwater does not render food susceptible to ritual impurity, so the <i>tamad</i> will do so only if it is regarded as wine.
The Gemara challenges this: <b>But since he took</b> the rainwater <b>and poured it into a container</b> holding the grape pomace, <b>he has</b> thereby <b>intended it</b> for a use. Even if the resulting <i>tamad</i> is regarded as water, such rainwater renders food susceptible to ritual impurity. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> in a case <b>where</b> the pomace <b>produced <i>tamad</i> by itself,</b> having been steeped in water that happened to fall upon it.
The Gemara persists: The <i>baraita</i> above states that from the third product, the <i>tamad</i> is regarded as water, which the Gemara has explained is referring to rainwater that one did not intend to use and that consequently cannot render food susceptible to impurity. The Gemara asks: <b>But since he draws off</b> each subsequent lot of <i>tamad</i> that is produced, <b>one by one,</b> in order to allow more rainwater to fall onto the pomace and produce more <i>tamad</i>, <b>he</b> thereby demonstrates his <b>intent to</b> use the rainwater. Therefore, even if the <i>tamad</i> is regarded as water, it should render food susceptible to impurity. The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Pappa says</b> that this is a case <b>of a cow that drank</b> the lots of <i>tamad</i>, <b>one by one,</b> and some inadvertently dripped from the cow’s mouth onto food. Since no person intended to use the <i>tamad</i>, if it is regarded as water it will not render food susceptible to impurity.
§ <b>Rav Zutra bar Toviyya says</b> that <b>Rav says: One may recite the sanctification of the</b> Shabbat <b>day only over wine</b> of a quality that is <b>fit to be poured</b> as a libation <b>upon the altar.</b>
The Gemara asks: This statement is said <b>to exclude what? If we say</b> it is <b>to exclude</b> the use of <b>wine</b> fresh <b>from one’s press,</b> i.e., grape juice, which has not yet fermented, that is difficult. <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach: One may not bring wine</b> fresh <b>from his press</b> as a libation <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but if one brought</b> it as a libation, <b>it is valid</b> after the fact. <b>And since if one brought</b> it as a libation <b>it is valid</b> after the fact, <b>we</b> should <b>also</b> be able to use it for the sanctification of the Shabbat day, <b>even <i>ab initio</i>.</b>

Daf 97b

<b>As Rava says: A person may squeeze</b> the juice from <b>a cluster of grapes and</b> then <b>recite the sanctification of the</b> Shabbat <b>day over it.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> Rav’s statement is <b>to exclude</b> wine that is taken <b>from</b> the <b>mouth of</b> the barrel, which has scum floating in it, <b>and</b> wine taken <b>from</b> the <b>bottom of</b> the barrel, which contains the pomace. The Gemara challenges this: <b>But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach: One may not bring</b> wine that is taken <b>from</b> the <b>mouth of</b> the barrel <b>or from</b> the <b>bottom of</b> the barrel as a libation <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but if one brought</b> it as a libation <b>it is valid</b> after the fact? Accordingly, it should be fit for use for the sanctification of the Shabbat day.
<b>Rather,</b> Rav’s statement is <b>to exclude black wine, <i>borek</i></b> wine, <b>sweet wine [<i>heiliston</i>],</b> wine <b>from</b> the <b>cellar,</b> and wine made <b>from raisins.</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to all of</b> these types of wine, <b>one may not bring</b> them as a libation <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but if one brought</b> one of them as a libation <b>it is valid</b> after the fact. Accordingly, it should be fit for use for the sanctification of the Shabbat day.
<b>Rather,</b> Rav’s statement serves <b>to exclude souring wine, diluted</b> wine, wine that has been left <b>uncovered,</b> as there is a concern that a snake may have injected its venom into it, <b>and</b> wine made <b>from</b> grape <b>pomace, and</b> wine that has a <b>foul odor. As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to all of</b> these types of wine, <b>one may not bring</b> them as a libation, <b>and if one brought</b> one of them as a libation, <b>it is disqualified.</b>
The Gemara asks again: Rav’s statement serves <b>to exclude which</b> of these types of wine? <b>If</b> one suggests Rav intended <b>to exclude souring</b> wine, that cannot be, as the status of wine that tastes like wine but has the odor of vinegar <b>is the</b> subject of a <b>dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> (96a).
<b>If</b> one suggests that Rav’s statement serves <b>to exclude diluted</b> wine, why would such wine be disqualified for the sanctification of the Shabbat day? Diluting wine <b>is an improvement of it, as Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> Even though the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Eliezer and hold that over undiluted wine one recites the blessing: Who created the fruit of the vine, nevertheless the <b>Rabbis concede to Rabbi Eliezer with regard to a cup</b> used <b>for a blessing,</b> such as the cup of wine over which Grace after Meals is recited, <b>that one does not recite</b> the <b>blessing over it until he adds water to it</b> to make it palatable.
<b>If</b> one suggests that Rav’s statement serves <b>to exclude</b> wine that has been left <b>uncovered,</b> it would be unnecessary for Rav to teach this, because such wine, which <b>is dangerous</b> to drink, as a snake may have injected its venom into it, is already forbidden.
<b>If</b> one suggests that Rav’s statement serves <b>to exclude</b> wine made <b>from pomace, what are the circumstances? If</b> it is referring to a case <b>where one poured three</b> jugs of water over the pomace <b>and</b> the volume of the resulting beverage <b>came to four</b> jugs, that <b>is</b> considered <b>full-fledged wine,</b> which may certainly be used for the sanctification of the Shabbat day. <b>If</b> it is referring to <b>where one poured three</b> jugs of water over the pomace, <b>and</b> the resulting beverage <b>came to three and a half</b> jugs, this <b>is the</b> subject of a <b>dispute</b> between <b>the Rabbis and <i>Aḥerim</i>,</b> and the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, who rule that it is not regarded as wine.
<b>Rather,</b> Rav’s statement serves <b>to exclude</b> wine <b>that</b> has <b>a foul odor. And if you wish, say</b> that <b>actually</b> his statement serves <b>to exclude</b> wine that has been left <b>uncovered, and</b> it teaches the novelty that <b>even though one passes it through a sieve, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Neḥemya</b> (see <i>Terumot</i> 8:7), <b>nevertheless,</b> it still may not be used for the sanctification of the Shabbat day. This is because it is disrespectful to use inferior wine for a mitzva, as derived from the verse in which God rebukes the Jewish people for offering lame animals as offerings: <b>“Present it now unto your governor; will he be pleased with you or will he accept your person?</b> says the Lord of hosts” (Malachi 1:8).
<b>Rav Kahana, father-in-law of Rav Mesharshiyya, asked Rava:</b> With regard to using <b>white wine</b> for libations and for the sanctification of the Shabbat day, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>He said to him</b> in response that the verse states: <b>“Do not look upon the wine when it is red,</b> when it gives its color in the cup, when it glides down smoothly” (Proverbs 23:31), which indicates that red wine is considered to be of a superior quality.
§ The mishna teaches: When purchasing <b>jugs</b> of wine <b>in the Sharon</b> region, he accepts upon himself that up to ten inferior-quality jugs may be present in each hundred jugs purchased. <b>It was taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The buyer must accept ten inferior-quality jugs in one hundred only when even those ten <b>inferior-quality jugs</b> are <b>beautiful and sealed with pitch</b> to strengthen them.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>sells wine to another and</b> then <b>it sours,</b> the seller <b>does not bear</b> financial <b>responsibility for its</b> loss. <b>But if it is known</b> of this seller <b>that his wine</b> always <b>sours, then this</b> sale <b>is a mistaken transaction,</b> i.e., one based upon false assumptions, as the buyer intended to purchase wine that would maintain its quality; therefore, the seller must reimburse the buyer. <b>And if</b> the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer: It is <b>wine</b>

Daf 98a

that is <b>spiced,</b> which is preserved and of lasting quality, that <b>I am selling to you,</b> then <b>he bears</b> financial <b>responsibility to provide him</b> with wine that will keep <b>until</b> the festival of <b><i>Shavuot</i>. And</b> if the seller said: I am selling you <b>old</b> wine, he is responsible to provide wine <b>from the previous year. And</b> if he said: I am selling you <b>aged</b> wine, he is responsible to provide wine that is <b>from three years</b> earlier.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> When <b>they taught</b> that the seller does not bear responsibility if the wine sours, that was <b>only</b> if it soured while <b>in</b> the <b>jugs of the buyer; but</b> if it soured <b>in</b> the <b>jugs of the seller,</b> then the buyer <b>could say to him: This is your wine and this is your jug;</b> take it and reimburse me. Since it soured while still in the original jugs, it was clearly flawed from the outset.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> even <b>if</b> the wine soured while in the <b>jugs of the seller, what of it? Let</b> the seller <b>say</b> to the buyer: <b>You should not have left it</b> for so long after purchasing it; I should not be responsible just because you chose to do so. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> this ruling is <b>necessary</b> in a case where the buyer <b>had said to him</b> that he was purchasing the wine <b>for cooking,</b> in which case it is understood that he needs it to maintain its quality over a longer period of time, as only a small amount is used each time.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what impelled Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, to interpret the mishna as referring to</b> a case where the wine soured while in the <b>jugs of the buyer, and where he had said to him</b> that he wanted the wine <b>for cooking?</b> Instead, <b>let him interpret it as referring to</b> a case where the wine soured while in the <b>jugs of the seller, and</b> to <b>where he had not said to him</b> that he wanted the wine <b>for cooking.</b>
In explanation, <b>Rava said: The mishna was difficult for him, as it teaches</b> in the following clause: <b>But if it is known</b> of this seller <b>that his wine</b> always <b>sours, then this</b> sale <b>is a mistaken transaction.</b> With regard to this clause one could ask: <b>Why</b> is that so? <b>Let</b> the seller <b>say to him: You should not have left it</b> for so long after purchasing it. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> that clause <b>that</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the buyer <b>had said to him</b> that he wants the wine <b>for cooking?</b> The Gemara concludes: Yes, one can <b>conclude from it</b> that this is so.
<b>And</b> Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, <b>disagrees</b> with the opinion <b>of Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef, as Rav Ḥiyya bar Yosef says:</b> With regard to <b>wine,</b> it is <b>the owner’s</b> poor <b>fortune</b> that <b>causes</b> the wine to go sour, <b>as it is stated: “And moreover, wine is a treacherous dealer;</b> the <b>haughty man</b> abides not” (Habakkuk 2:5), which is interpreted to mean that the wine of a haughty man will betray him, as it will sour as a punishment for his arrogance. Accordingly, since the wine soured after the buyer purchased it, he cannot place the blame upon the seller.
The Gemara offers additional homiletic interpretations of the verse just cited. <b>Rav Mari said: One who is haughty is not accepted even by the members of his household, as it is stated: “The haughty man abides not”</b> (Habakkuk 2:5). <b>What</b> does the phrase <b>“abides [<i>yinveh</i>] not”</b> mean? It means that <b>even in his abode [<i>naveh</i>],</b> he is not accepted.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who glorifies himself</b> by wearing <b>a garment of</b> the style worn by <b>a Torah scholar, but</b> in reality <b>he is not a Torah scholar, he will not be brought within the boundary of the Holy One, Blessed be He,</b> in the World-to-Come. This is alluded to by the fact that it is <b>written</b> in the verse <b>here: “Abides [<i>yinveh</i>] not,” and</b> the meaning of the word <i>yinveh</i> may be derived from that which <b>is written</b> in a verse <b>there: “To Your holy habitation [<i>neveh</i>]”</b> (Exodus 15:13).
<b>Rava says:</b> In the case of <b>one who sells a barrel of wine to a shopkeeper with the understanding</b> that the wine will be <b>for serving</b> to the shopkeeper’s customers and that he will be liable to pay the seller only once the barrel is finished, <b>and</b> the wine <b>spoiled</b> when <b>one-half or one-third</b> of the wine still remained, <b>the <i>halakha</i> is that</b> the seller must <b>accept</b> back the remaining wine <b>from</b> the shopkeeper, as the shopkeeper is liable to pay only for the wine that he sells. <b>And we stated this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the shopkeeper <b>had not switched the tap</b> of the barrel; <b>but</b> if <b>he had switched the tap,</b> the seller does <b>not</b> have to take the wine back and the shopkeeper must pay for it all. <b>And</b> furthermore, <b>we stated this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>only where</b> the wine soured <b>before the market day arrived</b> and the shopkeeper did not have the opportunity to sell the entire barrel; <b>but</b> if the wine was still of good quality when <b>the market day arrived,</b> then the seller does <b>not</b> have to take the wine back.
<b>And Rava says:</b> In the case of a vintner who enters a business venture with another person who will sell the wine for him and afterward they will split the profits, then if <b>this</b> middleman <b>who receives the wine</b> to sell does so <b>with the understanding that he will bring it to the port of</b> the city of <b>Vol Shefat</b> and sell it only there, <b>and before he arrives there</b> the <b>price</b> of the wine <b>drops, the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>that</b> the vintner must <b>accept</b> the loss.
With regard to the previous case, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If the wine <b>becomes vinegar</b> before he reaches Vol Shefat, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Hillel said to Rav Ashi: When we were in the study hall of Rav Kahana, he said to us:</b> If the wine becomes <b>vinegar,</b> the vintner does <b>not</b> have to accept the loss; <b>and</b> this is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> who holds that as long as the wine is in the jug of the seller he is able to return it to the seller. The reason for this is that it is possible that the poor fortune of the middleman caused it to sour.
<b>And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that <b>even</b> if the wine turns into <b>vinegar,</b> the vintner must <b>also accept</b> the loss. <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion is this? It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina.</b>
The mishna teaches: If the seller said: I am selling you <b>old</b> wine, he is responsible to provide wine <b>from the previous year.</b> And if he said: I am selling you aged wine, he is responsible to provide wine that is from three years earlier.

Daf 98b

<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> where he sold him aged wine, he is responsible to provide wine that will <b>continue to age,</b> i.e., maintain its quality, <b>until the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who sells a plot</b> of land <b>to another,</b> with the buyer intending to build a bridal house for his son or a widowhood home for his daughter on that plot, <b>and similarly,</b> with regard to a contractor <b>who receives a plot</b> of land <b>from another</b> under a commission <b>to build for</b> the owner on that land <b>a bridal house for his son, or a widowhood home for his daughter,</b> the terms of the transaction are a matter of dispute. The mishna presents the dispute: In the latter case, the contractor must <b>build</b> a building that is at least <b>four cubits by six</b> cubits in size, and similarly, in the case of the sale, the seller must provide a plot of land that can accommodate a building of that size; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> A structure of <b>this</b> size <b>is a cowshed,</b> and a bridal house or a widowhood home is larger than that.
<b>One who wants to construct a cowshed builds</b> a structure at least <b>four cubits by six</b> cubits in size.
The mishna delineates the standard dimensions for various other structures. <b>A small house</b> is <b>six by eight</b> cubits. <b>A large</b> house is <b>eight by ten</b> cubits. <b>A banquet hall [<i>teraklin</i>]</b> is <b>ten by ten</b> cubits. The standard <b>height</b> for each of these structures is <b>equal to</b> the sum of <b>half its length and half its width.</b> There is <b>a proof of the matter; Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The proportions are <b>like the building of the Sanctuary;</b> it was forty cubits wide and twenty cubits long and its height was thirty cubits, which is the sum of half the width and half the length.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Why do I</b> need the mishna <b>to teach</b> specifically: <b>A bridal house for his son, and: A widowhood home for his daughter?</b> Instead, <b>let it teach: A bridal house for his son or his daughter, and a widowhood home for his son or his daughter.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>It teaches us a matter in passing, that it is not the</b> proper <b>manner</b> of conduct <b>for a son-in-law to live in his father-in-law’s home.</b> Therefore, it is the father of the groom who generally provides a bridal home for the couple and the bride will return to live near her parents’ house only if she is widowed or divorced.
Support for this is <b>as it is written in the book of ben Sira: I have weighed everything in the pan of a balance scale and I have not found anything inferior to bran; but inferior to bran is a son-in-law who lives in his father-in-law’s house; and inferior to a son-in-law is a guest who brings in a guest; and inferior to a guest is one who answers a matter before he listens. As it is stated: “He that gives an answer before he listens, it is folly for him and a disgrace”</b> (Proverbs 18:13).
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> A structure of <b>this</b> size <b>is a cowshed.</b> And then the mishna continues: <b>One who wants to construct</b> a cowshed builds a structure at least four cubits by six cubits in size. The Gemara asks: <b>Who teaches</b> this subsequent clause about <b>a cowshed? There is</b> a Sage <b>who says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael teaches it</b> and it is an elaboration of his statement. <b>And there is</b> a Sage <b>who says</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva teaches it</b> in response to Rabbi Yishmael’s statement.
The Gemara elaborates: <b>There is</b> a Sage <b>who says</b> that <b>Rabbi Akiva teaches it, and this</b> is what Rabbi Akiva <b>is saying: Even though</b> this structure <b>is</b> of the same dimensions as <b>a cowshed,</b> nevertheless, since there are <b>times when a person constructs his home</b> as small <b>as a cowshed,</b> a contractor has fulfilled his commission if he builds a house to such dimensions. <b>And there is</b> a Sage <b>who says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yishmael teaches it, and this</b> is what Rabbi Yishmael <b>is saying</b> to Rabbi Akiva: The dimensions that you stated are clearly not the correct dimensions for a bridal house or widowhood home, <b>as one who wants to construct a cowshed constructs</b> a structure of <b>four cubits by six</b> cubits. A house for human dwelling is certainly larger than that.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>A banquet hall</b> is <b>ten by ten</b> cubits. The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is a banquet hall? A pavilion of roses.</b>
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The standard size of <b>a <i>kanteir</i></b> is <b>twelve by twelve</b> cubits. The Gemara clarifies: <b>What is a <i>kanteir</i>?</b> It is a decorative <b>courtyard of a mansion.</b>
The mishna teaches: The standard <b>height</b> for each of these structures is <b>equal to</b> the sum of <b>half its length and half its width.</b> There is <b>a proof of the matter; Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The proportions are <b>like the building of the Sanctuary.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Who teaches</b> the phrase: <b>Proof of the matter? There is</b> a Sage <b>who says</b> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel teaches it, and this</b> is what he <b>is saying: From where</b> can <b>a proof of the matter</b> be derived? The mishna then cites that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said</b> that <b>everything is like the building of the Sanctuary.</b>
<b>And there is</b> a Sage <b>who says</b> that <b>the first <i>tanna</i> teaches it, and,</b> understanding that the proof the <i>tanna</i> wished to cite was from the example of the Sanctuary, <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> interjected and <b>expressed astonishment</b> at the idea. <b>And this is what</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <b>is saying to the first <i>tanna</i>: From where</b> do you derive <b>a proof?</b> Do you derive it <b>from the building of the Sanctuary? Is that to say</b> that <b>everyone constructs</b> their buildings <b>like the building of the Sanctuary?</b> Why should they do so?
<b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> The standard <b>height of</b> each of these structures is <b>equal to</b> the length of <b>its crossbeams.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> us <b>say</b> more simply that <b>its height</b> is <b>equal to its width.</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that formulating the ruling in this way is necessary, because the space inside <b>a house widens at the top,</b> as the walls get thinner toward the top and the crossbeams are actually longer than the width of the floor of the building. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that formulating it in this way is necessary <b>because there are indentations</b> in the wall into which the crossbeams are inserted. The crossbeams are consequently longer than the space inside the house.
§ Apropos the building of the Sanctuary, the Gemara relates the following incident: <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> once <b>went out to the villages</b> to teach Torah there, and <b>he raised a contradiction between</b> two <b>verses</b> that detail the dimensions of the Sanctuary: <b>It is written: “And the house that King Solomon built for the Lord, was sixty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in width, and its height was thirty cubits”</b> (I Kings 6:2). <b>But it is</b> also <b>written: “And before the partition was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in width, and its height was twenty cubits”</b> (I Kings 6:20). The first verse states that its height was thirty cubits, whereas the second verse states that its height was only twenty cubits. <b>He said to</b> the villagers that the reason for the difference is that <b>when</b> the latter verse <b>calculated</b> the height, it did so <b>from the</b> upper <b>edge of the cherubs and upward,</b> as the cherubs themselves stood ten cubits high.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the verse <b>teaching us</b> by considering only the area above the cherubs?

Daf 99a

The verse <b>teaches us this:</b> The area <b>below</b> the cherubs <b>is like</b> the area <b>above</b> them; <b>just as</b> the area <b>above</b> the cherubs’ wings, which were spread out in the air, <b>was not used for anything,</b> i.e., it was empty space, <b>so too</b> the area <b>below</b> them <b>was not used for anything</b> and was empty.
This <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Levi, as Rabbi Levi said, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who said: <b>This matter is a tradition handed</b> down <b>to us by our ancestors: The space</b> occupied by the <b>Ark</b> of the Covenant <b>and</b> the <b>cherubs is not</b> included <b>in the measurement</b> of the Holy of Holies in which it rested, as miraculously it did not occupy any space at all. The Gemara comments: <b>This is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When they brought <b>the Ark that Moses crafted</b> into the Holy of Holies in the Temple of King Solomon, even though the total width of the Holy of Holies was only twenty cubits, nevertheless the Ark <b>had ten cubits</b> of empty <b>space</b> between it and the wall <b>in each and every direction.</b>
<b>Rabbenai says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b>cherubs stood miraculously</b> and did not occupy any physical space, <b>as it is stated: “And five cubits was one wing of the cherub, and five cubits was the second wing of the cherub; ten cubits from the tip of its wings until the tip of its wings”</b> (I Kings 6:24). Accordingly, the wings of two cherubs, standing side by side, would occupy the entire twenty cubits width of the Sanctuary. But if so, <b>where,</b> in what space, <b>were their bodies standing?</b> Since their wings alone, which protruded from the sides of cherubs’ bodies, occupied twenty cubits, there was no room left in which their bodies could stand. <b>Rather,</b> one must <b>conclude from</b> the verse that the cherubs <b>stood miraculously</b> and did not occupy any physical space.
<b>Abaye objects to this</b> proof: <b>But perhaps they stood</b> with their bodies <b>emerging</b> beneath their wings, <b>like chickens,</b> with their wings protruding above them from the same point in the center of their backs. If so, their bodies would stand beneath their wings and would not occupy any additional space. <b>Rava</b> also <b>objects to this</b> proof: <b>But perhaps they stood</b> so that <b>this</b> one <b>was not next to that</b> one and the wings of the two cherubs overlapped, thereby allowing for the additional space occupied by their bodies. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Yaakov</b> also <b>objects to this</b> proof: <b>But perhaps they were standing in a diagonal [<i>ba’alakhsona</i>]</b> alignment from one corner of the Holy of Holies to the diagonally opposite corner. In this way there would be enough space for their bodies and their wings.
<b>Rav Huna son of Rav Yehoshua</b> also <b>objects to this</b> proof: <b>But perhaps</b> the width of twenty cubits stated in the verse refers only to the width at ground level, whereas <b>the room widened at the top</b> and was therefore able to accommodate both their wings and the width of the bodies. <b>Rav Pappa</b> also <b>objects to this</b> proof: <b>But perhaps they were folding their wings</b> somewhat; since their wings were not fully extended they did not actually fill the full twenty cubits of the Sanctuary. <b>Rav Ashi</b> also <b>objects to this</b> proof: <b>But perhaps</b> their wings <b>crossed over</b> one another, so that they did not occupy so much space.
§ Continuing its focus on the cherubs, the Gemara asks: <b>How were</b> the cherubs <b>standing? Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Elazar</b> disagree about this. <b>One says: Their faces</b> were turned <b>one toward the other. And one says: Their faces</b> were turned <b>toward the House,</b> i.e., the Sanctuary. The Gemara asks: <b>But according to the one who says</b> that <b>their faces</b> were turned <b>one toward the other, isn’t it written: “And their faces were toward the House”</b> (II Chronicles 3:13)? How does he explain the meaning of this verse? The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult,</b> as their faces miraculously changed directions in reflection of the Jewish people’s relationship to God. <b>Here,</b> when it states that the cherubs faced each other, it was <b>when the Jewish people do the will of God. There,</b> the verse that describes that the cherubs faced the Sanctuary and not toward each other, was <b>when the Jewish people do not do the will of God.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who says</b> they stood as described in the verse: <b>“And their faces were toward the House,” isn’t it written: “With their faces one toward the other”</b> (Exodus 25:20). How does he explain the meaning of this verse? The Gemara answers: <b>They were angled sideways</b> so that they turned both to each other and toward the Sanctuary, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Onkelos the Convert said</b> that the <b>cherubs were</b> of the <b>form of children,</b> as the verse states: “And in the Holy of Holies he made two cherubim of the form of children; and they overlaid them with gold” (II Chronicles 3:10), <b>and their faces were angled sideways</b> toward the Ark of the Covenant, <b>like a student taking leave of his teacher.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who has</b> ownership of <b>a cistern</b> located <b>beyond the house of another,</b> i.e., the cistern can be accessed only by entering the property of the other, and also has access rights to that cistern, <b>may enter</b> the house to access his cistern only <b>at a time when it is usual for people to enter, and may leave</b> only <b>at a time when it is usual for people to leave. And</b> in addition, <b>he may not bring his animal</b> into the house <b>and water</b> it <b>from his cistern; rather, he</b> must <b>fill</b> a pail with water from the cistern <b>and water</b> his animal <b>outside. And this</b> one, the owner of the cistern, <b>constructs for himself a lock</b> on the entrance to the cistern to prevent the homeowner from drawing water from it, <b>and that</b> one, the homeowner, <b>constructs for himself a lock.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that the owner of the cistern and the homeowner each construct a lock. The Gemara asks: <b>A lock to where? Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Both of them</b> construct a lock on the opening <b>to the cistern</b> to prevent the other from accessing it unilaterally. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, the owner of the cistern</b> constructs a lock, as <b>he wants to protect the water of his well. But why</b> does <b>the homeowner</b> construct a lock? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b>

Daf 99b

He does so <b>due to a suspicion</b> that the owner of the cistern might enter the house at a time when the owner of the house is not present, and thereby be secluded together in the house with the homeowner’s <b>wife.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who has</b> ownership of <b>a garden</b> located <b>beyond the garden of another,</b> and also has access rights to it, <b>may enter</b> his garden only <b>at a time when it is usual for people to enter, and may leave</b> only <b>at a time when it is usual for people to leave.</b> Furthermore, he <b>may not bring merchants into</b> his garden, <b>and he may not</b> enter the garden solely in order to use it as a passageway, to <b>enter from it into another field. And the</b> owner of the <b>outer</b> garden <b>may sow the path</b> leading to the inner garden.
If the court <b>gave him</b> an access <b>path from the side</b> of the outer garden, <b>with the agreement of both of them,</b> he <b>may enter at</b> any <b>time he wants, and leave at</b> any <b>time he wants, and may bring merchants into</b> the inner garden. <b>But</b> he <b>may</b> still <b>not</b> enter the garden solely in order to <b>enter from it into another field.</b> In such a case, <b>neither this</b> one, the owner of the inner garden, <b>nor that</b> one, the owner of the outer garden, <b>is permitted to plant</b> that side path.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If a field owner says to another: <b>I am selling you</b> from my land a water <b>channel</b> fit <b>for</b> bringing water to <b>an irrigated field,</b> he is required to <b>give him</b> land <b>two cubits</b> wide <b>for the inside</b> of the channel, <b>and</b> one <b>cubit on this</b> side <b>and</b> one <b>cubit on that</b> side <b>for its banks.</b> If he said to him: <b>I am selling you a shadoof [<i>kilon</i>] channel,</b> he is required to <b>give him</b> land <b>one cubit</b> wide <b>for the inside</b> of the channel <b>and half a cubit on this</b> side <b>and half a cubit on that</b> side <b>for its banks.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>those banks, who</b> has permission to <b>sow them? Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Shmuel says: The field owner may sow them</b> with vegetables or crops. <b>Rav Naḥman</b> says that <b>Shmuel says: The field owner may plant them</b> with trees. The Gemara elaborates: <b>The one who says</b> that the field owner <b>may sow them</b> holds that <b>all the more so he may plant them</b> with trees. <b>And the one who says</b> that <b>he may plant them</b> with trees holds that he may only plant trees, <b>but sowing them</b> with other plants is <b>not</b> permitted. This is because the roots <b>perforate</b> the ground, which weakens it and can cause damage to the water channel.
§ <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a water channel whose banks collapsed,</b> the owner of the channel may <b>repair it</b> with earth <b>from that field</b> through which the channel runs, even though the field does not belong to him. It is permitted because <b>it is known that</b> when <b>its banks collapsed</b> the earth that the banks were made from spread <b>only into that</b> surrounding <b>field.</b>
<b>Rav Pappa objects to this: But let</b> the field owner <b>say to</b> the owner of the channel: <b>Your water</b> in your channel <b>carried away your earth</b> from your banks, so you have no right to take earth from my field. <b>Rather, Rav Pappa said</b> he may repair the banks with earth from the field <b>because</b> when <b>the field owner</b> sold the rights to the channel <b>he accepted that condition upon himself.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who had a public thoroughfare passing through his field,</b> and he <b>appropriated it and</b> instead <b>gave</b> the public an alternative thoroughfare <b>on the side</b> of his property, the <i>halakha</i> is that the thoroughfare <b>that he gave</b> them, <b>he gave</b> them, and they may use it. <b>But</b> the original thoroughfare that he took <b>for himself has not reached him,</b> i.e., he cannot appropriate it for his personal use.
The standard width of <b>a private path</b> is <b>four cubits.</b> If a field owner sells the right to pass through his field to an individual, without specifying the width of the path, he must provide him with a path four cubits wide. The standard width of <b>a public thoroughfare</b> is <b>sixteen cubits.</b> The width of <b>a king’s thoroughfare has no</b> maximum <b>measure,</b> as the king may appropriate whatever width thoroughfare he wishes. The width of the <b>path for</b> the burial procession to <b>a grave has no</b> maximum <b>measure.</b> With regard to <b>the</b> practice of <b>standing</b> and comforting the mourners following a funeral, <b>the judges of Tzippori said</b> that the standard requisite size is the <b>area required for sowing four <i>kav</i> of seed.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Why</b> does the mishna rule that the public thoroughfare that the landowner took <b>for himself has not reached him?</b> If by making the exchange the original thoroughfare now belongs to him, <b>let him take a stick [<i>pazra</i>] and sit</b> on the thoroughfare and physically prevent anyone from passing through. Apparently, the Sages did not permit him to do so. The Gemara suggests: Does it follow that one can <b>conclude from</b> the mishna’s ruling that <b>a person may not execute judgment for himself even in circumstances</b> where refraining from acting will cause him <b>a loss?</b> This would contradict the accepted <i>halakha</i> that one may do so.
<b>Rav Zevid said in the name of Rava:</b> Although generally one may do so, in this case the Sages issued <b>a decree</b> prohibiting it, <b>lest he give them a circuitous route</b> that will lengthen the distance the public will have to travel. <b>Rav Mesharshiyya said in the name of Rava</b> that the ruling of the mishna applies only <b>where he</b> actually <b>gives them a circuitous route</b> instead of the original straight thoroughfare. But one may exchange a public thoroughfare for an equally straight thoroughfare, appropriating the original for his personal use.

Daf 100a

<b>Rav Ashi said: Any</b> alternative path <b>on the side</b> of the original path <b>is</b> considered <b>a circuitous route,</b> as it is <b>close for this</b> person <b>and it is far for that</b> person. While some will benefit from the change, it will be detrimental to others. Therefore, one may never exchange a public path for an alternative path.
§ The mishna teaches that if a field owner provides an alternative thoroughfare through his field for the public to use, the public may use both thoroughfares. The Gemara suggests: <b>But let him say to them: Take your</b> original thoroughfare back <b>and give me my</b> thoroughfare that I provided you. The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? It <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> If the <b>public selected a thoroughfare</b> through a privately owned field <b>for themselves</b> even without gaining the permission of the field owner, <b>that which they selected, they selected,</b> and they have the right to use it.
The Gemara asks: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, are</b> the members of the <b>public</b> entitled to be <b>robbers?</b> Why should they be permitted to appropriate land from a private owner? <b>Rav Giddel said</b> that <b>Rav said:</b> Rabbi Eliezer refers only to a case <b>where</b> the public <b>lost a thoroughfare in that field,</b> e.g., the field was plowed over and the original course of the thoroughfare is not known. In such a case, the public has the right to determine the course anew.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, why does Rabba bar Rav Huna say</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer?</b> His reasoning seems valid. The Gemara answers: The <b>one who teaches this,</b> i.e., that Rabbi Eliezer is referring to a case where a thoroughfare was lost, <b>does not teach that,</b> i.e., that Rav rules against Rabbi Eliezer. There is a dispute as to what Rav said.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to Rabba bar Rav Huna, <b>what is the reason</b> the field owner cannot reclaim the alternative thoroughfare that he gave to the public? The Gemara answers: It is <b>due to</b> the statement <b>of Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda says:</b> With regard to a strip of land that serves as <b>a border</b> between two strips of land <b>that the public took possession of</b> as a public thoroughfare, <b>it is prohibited to destroy it</b> for them, i.e., prevent people from using it. Accordingly, in the case of the mishna, where the field owner actually provided the public with a thoroughfare, he may certainly not take it back.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi Eliezer, through what</b> means <b>does the public acquire</b> the thoroughfare they choose? The Gemara answers: <b>By</b> means of <b>walking</b> on the thoroughfare, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one walked along</b> a field’s <b>length and its breadth, he has acquired the area</b> inside <b>where he walked,</b> as walking is an effective act of acquisition; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. And the Rabbis say</b> that by itself, <b>walking is not</b> effective <b>at all</b> to acquire a field, and it is not acquired <b>until he takes possession</b> of it using a legal act of acquisition.
<b>Rabbi Elazar said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer? As it is written</b> that after God promised Abraham Eretz Yisrael, He instructed him: <b>“Arise, walk through the land, its length and its breadth; for I will give it to you”</b> (Genesis 13:17), in order that Abraham should thereby acquire the land. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> how do they interpret this verse? They hold that <b>there,</b> in Genesis, it was <b>due to</b> God’s <b>love of Abraham that he said to him</b> to do <b>this, in order that it would be easy for his descendants to conquer</b> the land. His walking was to demonstrate the divine promise and thereby emphasize his descendants’ claim to the land, but it did not effect acquisition of it.
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says: The Rabbis concede to Rabbi Eliezer with regard to a path</b> that passes <b>through vineyards</b> that <b>since</b> the path <b>is made</b> only <b>for walking</b> on it, <b>it can be acquired by</b> means of <b>walking</b> on it.
The Gemara relates an incident involving the allocation of a path through a vineyard: <b>When</b> people <b>came before Rav Yitzḥak bar Ami</b> for judgment with regard to the width of a path through a vineyard that someone had purchased, <b>he said to them: Give him</b> a path wide enough <b>so that one can carry a load [<i>tuna</i>] of vine branches [<i>dishvishta</i>]</b> along it <b>and</b> is able to <b>turn around</b> while holding them. The Gemara comments: <b>And we said</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where</b> the sides of the path <b>are bounded by a fence,</b> which would physically prevent a person from carrying a load of vine branches that are wider than the path, and therefore, if necessary, the path must be widened by breaking down the fence. <b>But</b> where the sides <b>are not bound by a fence,</b> a person carrying a load of vine branches will not be prevented from passing along it. Consequently, he needs only to be given a path wide enough <b>so that he can lift up</b> one <b>foot and place</b> it in front of the other <b>foot.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: The standard width of <b>a private path</b> is <b>four cubits. It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say:</b> A private path is wide enough <b>so that a donkey can pass on</b> it <b>with his load. Rav Huna says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>. And it is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>The judges of the exile say</b> that the standard width is <b>two and a half cubits. And Rav Huna says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>judges of the exile.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rav Huna say:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b><i>Aḥerim</i>?</b> The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <b>This</b> definition <b>and that</b> definition <b>are one</b> and the same <b>measure.</b>
The mishna teaches: The standard width of <b>a public thoroughfare</b> is <b>sixteen cubits. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The standard width of <b>a private path</b> is <b>four cubits.</b> The standard width of <b>a road</b> that goes <b>from city to city</b> is <b>eight cubits.</b>

Daf 100b

The standard width of <b>a public thoroughfare</b> is <b>sixteen cubits. A road</b> leading to one of the <b>cities of refuge</b> must be at least <b>thirty-two cubits</b> wide. <b>Rav Huna said: What is the verse</b> from which this is derived? <b>As it is written</b> with regard to the cities of refuge: <b>“You shall prepare for yourself the way,</b> and divide the borders of your land that the Lord, your God, caused you to inherit, into three parts, so that every manslayer may flee there” (Deuteronomy 19:3). Instead of simply stating: <b>A way,</b> the verse states: <b>“The way,”</b> to indicate that the road must be twice as wide as a standard public thoroughfare.
The mishna teaches: <b>A king’s thoroughfare has no</b> maximum <b>measure.</b> The Gemara explains: This is <b>because</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>that a king may breach</b> the <b>fence</b> of an individual <b>in order to create a thoroughfare for himself, and none</b> may <b>protest his</b> actions.
The mishna teaches: The <b>path for</b> those accompanying a deceased person to <b>a grave has no</b> maximum <b>measure.</b> The Gemara explains: This is <b>due to the honor of the deceased.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to the practice of <b>standing</b> and comforting the mourners following a funeral, <b>the judges of Tzippori said</b> that the standard requisite size is the <b>area required for sowing four <i>kav</i> of seed. The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a family burial plot, even if <b>one</b> of the family <b>sells</b> the land designated for <b>his</b> own <b>grave</b> to another, or sells <b>the path</b> that will be used by the burial procession <b>to his grave,</b> or sells <b>the place</b> that will be used <b>for standing</b> and comforting <b>his</b> mourners, <b>or</b> sells the <b>site</b> that will be used <b>for his eulogy,</b> his <b>family members may come and bury him</b> in his grave <b>even against the will of</b> the buyer, <b>due to</b> the need to avoid <b>a family flaw,</b> i.e., harm to the family name that would arise if one of the family members was not buried with the rest of his family.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: On their return from the burial, the mourners would stop after traveling a short distance and would sit to bewail the loss of the deceased. They would then stand and continue journeying for a short while and then repeat the procedure. The mourners perform <b>no fewer than seven standings and sittings</b> in honor <b>of the deceased.</b> These seven <b>correspond</b> to the seven references to “vanity” in the verse: <b>“Vanity of vanities, says Kohelet; vanity of vanities, all is vanity”</b> (Ecclesiastes 1:2), counting the plural term “vanities” as two references.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rava, said to Rav Ashi: How do they perform</b> this ceremony? Rav Ashi <b>said to him</b> that it is done <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> that <b>in Judea, initially they would</b> perform <b>no fewer than seven standings and sittings</b> in honor <b>of the deceased.</b> One of the procession would make a statement <b>such as: Stand, dear</b> friends, <b>stand,</b> after which the mourners would continue on their journey to their home, and then he would say: <b>Sit down, dear</b> friends, <b>sit down,</b> at which point they would sit. The Rabbis <b>said to him: If so,</b> that this is all that the practice entails, then it should be <b>permitted to do so even on Shabbat,</b> since there is no explicit eulogy or mourning, whereas the custom is not to do so.
The Gemara relates: <b>The sister of Rami bar Pappa was married to Rav Avya.</b> When <b>she died</b> Rav Avya <b>performed</b> the practice of <b>standing and sitting for her. Rav Yosef said: He erred in two</b> matters. <b>He erred,</b> as the ceremony is to be <b>performed only with</b> the participation of <b>close</b> family members, <b>and he performed</b> it <b>even with a distant</b> relative. <b>And</b> he <b>erred</b> again, <b>as</b> mourners should <b>perform this</b> ceremony <b>only on the first day</b> of mourning, the day of the burial, <b>and he performed it on the second day.</b>
<b>Abaye said: He also erred in this, as</b> mourners should <b>perform</b> the ceremony <b>only in</b> the <b>cemetery, but he performed it in the city. Rava said: He also erred in this, as</b> mourners should <b>perform it only in a locale where</b> people <b>are accustomed do so, but there,</b> where he performed it, <b>it was not the custom</b> to do so.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the claims of Rav Yosef and Abaye from the <i>baraita</i> cited above: The Rabbis <b>said to him: If so,</b> that this is all that the practice entails, then it should be <b>permitted to do so even on Shabbat.</b> The Gemara explains the objection: <b>And if you say,</b> as Abaye did, that the ceremony should be performed only <b>in</b> the <b>cemetery, or,</b> as Rav Yosef did, <b>on the first day,</b> then how could it occur that the ceremony would be performed on Shabbat; <b>what would</b> anyone <b>want</b> to be doing <b>in a cemetery on Shabbat,</b> when it is prohibited to perform a burial? The Gemara explains: It could happen <b>in a city that is close to the cemetery,</b> and this is a case <b>where they brought</b> the deceased <b>for burial at twilight</b> just before Shabbat began, so that the return journey took place on Shabbat itself.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> There is the case of <b>one who sells a plot</b> of land <b>to another</b> in order for him <b>to construct for himself</b> an underground <b>catacomb, and similarly</b> the case of a contractor <b>who receives a plot</b> of land <b>from another</b> under a commission <b>to construct for him a catacomb.</b> If the size of the catacomb was not specified, then <b>he should make the inside of</b> each burial <b>chamber four cubits</b> wide <b>by six</b> cubits long <b>and open up into</b> the chamber, by digging into its walls, <b>eight</b> burial <b>niches [<i>kukhin</i>]</b> in which the coffins will rest. <b>Three</b> niches should be opened up <b>from</b> the wall <b>here,</b> along the length of the chamber, <b>and three from there,</b> along the other side, <b>and two</b> niches <b>from</b> the wall <b>facing</b> the entrance. <b>And</b> these <b>niches</b> should be formed so that <b>their length</b> is <b>four cubits and their height</b> is <b>seven</b> handbreadths,

Daf 101a

<b>and their width</b> is <b>six</b> handbreadths.
<b>Rabbi Shimon says: He should construct the inside of</b> each burial <b>chamber six cubits</b> wide <b>by eight</b> cubits long <b>and open up into</b> the chamber, by digging into its walls, <b>thirteen</b> burial <b>niches. Four</b> niches should be opened up <b>from</b> the wall <b>here,</b> along the length of the chamber, <b>and four from there,</b> along the other side, <b>and three</b> niches <b>from</b> the wall <b>facing</b> the entrance, <b>and one from the right of the entrance and</b> another <b>one from the left.</b>
The mishna describes the general structure of the catacomb: <b>And he</b> must <b>fashion a courtyard at the entrance of the</b> burial <b>chamber</b> that should be <b>six</b> cubits <b>by six</b> cubits, which is <b>equal to the</b> combined <b>length</b> of <b>the bier</b> of the deceased <b>and those who bury him,</b> to ensure adequate room for the burial to take place.
<b>And he</b> should <b>open up two</b> burial <b>chambers into</b> the courtyard, <b>one from here and one from there,</b> i.e., on opposite sides of the courtyard. <b>Rabbi Shimon says:</b> He should open up <b>four</b> burial chambers, one <b>on</b> each of the courtyard’s <b>four sides.</b>
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Everything</b> is <b>dependent on</b> the nature of <b>the bedrock.</b> If the bedrock is hard and strong it will be able to accommodate more niches, which will be more closely packed together, with less bedrock between them. If the bedrock is softer, fewer and more sparsely spaced niches should be formed.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> In Rabbi Shimon’s depiction of a burial chamber, he states that two niches should be opened up, one from the right of the entrance and one from the left. The Gemara asks: <b>These two</b> niches, <b>in which</b> direction <b>does he set them? If</b> they are directed <b>toward the outside</b> of the chamber, i.e., under the floor of the courtyard, <b>won’t</b> people <b>trample</b> over <b>them</b> when they enter the courtyard, which is improper? <b>And furthermore, didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Oholot</i> 15:8): With regard to <b>the courtyard of a catacomb, one who stands inside it</b> is <b>ritually pure</b> because it can be presumed that he did not stand over a dead body? Clearly, these niches are not to be dug underneath the courtyard.
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said: He makes</b> these two niches at the side of the entrance, vertically, <b>like a door bolt.</b>
The Gemara challenges this explanation: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> with regard to the burial of people in a vertical position:

Daf 101b

<b>This is</b> like <b>a burial of donkeys</b> and is disrespectful.
The Gemara answers: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> each of these two niches is <b>formed in</b> a different <b>corner</b> of the chamber, aligned diagonally away from the chamber’s cavity.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> if so, <b>won’t</b> the <b>niches</b> located around the corners <b>touch one another?</b> According to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s suggestion, there are, in fact, three niches located at each of the two back corners. One is recessed into the wall of the length of the chamber, at right angles to it, another is recessed into the back wall of the chamber, also at right angles to it, and a third that extends diagonally away from the chamber. The ends of these three niches will overlap, causing there to be too little space in them to fulfill the minimum required measurement.
<b>Rav Ashi said:</b> It is possible to do this <b>where,</b> when constructing the niches that extend diagonally away from the chamber, <b>one deepens</b> them, i.e., forms them lower down in the wall than the other niches adjacent to them. <b>As, if you do not say</b> that <b>this</b> is a solution, then <b>how could</b> the <b>four chambers</b> depicted <b>by Rabbi Shimon be constructed? Won’t the niches touch one another?</b> The niches of one chamber will overlap those of the chamber adjacent to it. <b>Rather,</b> it is possible arrange the niches only <b>where,</b> when constructing the niches of two chambers at opposite ends of the courtyard, <b>one deepens</b> them, i.e., forms them lower down in the wall than the niches of the other two chambers that are adjacent to them. <b>Here too,</b> it is a case in which <b>one deepens them.</b>
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said</b> that there is an alternative explanation: It is possible to fashion the <b>four chambers</b> depicted <b>by Rabbi Shimon where one constructs them</b> so that all the niches extend diagonally away from the cavity of the chamber <b>like</b> the leaves of <b>a palm branch,</b> which have spread out from its spine. If formed in this way, the niches of adjacent chambers will not overlap, even if they are at the same depth in the ground.
The Gemara notes: <b>And this</b> statement <b>of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, is an error,</b> because it is not possible to form all the niches in this way, <b>since</b> the length of <b>the diagonal of every square</b> whose side is <b>one cubit is one and two-fifths cubits.</b> Each chamber is eight cubits long, which means that between two adjacent chambers, placed at right angles to each other, there is a square area of eight cubits by eight cubits into which the niches of those two chambers must be formed. <b>How much is</b> the diagonal of that area? <b>Eleven and one-fifth cubits. How many niches</b> have to fit in that space? <b>Eight. How can you find</b> that <b>eight</b> niches can possibly fit <b>into eleven and one-fifth cubits?</b> Each of the niches is a cubit wide, and there must be a cubit wall of bedrock between each niche. To accommodate this once would need an area of at least fifteen cubits. <b>Rather, this</b> statement <b>of Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, is in error.</b>
The Gemara provides an alternative solution to the problem of the niches at the corners overlapping. <b>Or if you wish, say as Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said</b> in answer to a similar question: It is referring to <b>non-viable newborns,</b> which require only very small burial niches. Similarly, <b>here also,</b> the niches at the corners of the chambers were used <b>for non-viable newborns.</b>
§ The Gemara considers another mishna that relates to the structure of a catacomb: <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Nazir</i> 64b): With regard to <b>one who finds a corpse</b> while inspecting a place that was not previously established as a cemetery, to ensure that it is free of ritual impurity, and the corpse is <b>lying in</b> the <b>usual manner</b> of Jewish burial, <b>he removes it</b> from there <b>and</b> also removes <b>its surrounding</b> earth. And similarly, if he finds <b>two</b> corpses buried in the usual manner, <b>he removes them and their surrounding</b> earth. Since only one or two corpses were found, it may be assumed that the area is not a cemetery; therefore, the corpses may be removed.

Daf 102a

If <b>he found three</b> corpses lying parallel to each other, then <b>if there is between them,</b> i.e., the outer two corpses, a distance <b>of four to eight</b> cubits, then <b>this is</b> presumed to be <b>a graveyard</b> and the corpses may not be removed, <b>and he</b> must <b>examine from that</b> spot <b>outward twenty cubits</b> to discover whether there are other corpses buried there. If he <b>finds</b> even <b>one</b> corpse <b>up to</b> the distance of <b>twenty cubits, he</b> must continue to <b>examine from</b> the place he finds that corpse <b>outward</b> another <b>twenty cubits.</b> He continues to search for additional corpses, even if only one corpse was found within the twenty cubits, <b>as there is a basis for</b> anticipating <b>the matter;</b> it is probable that he has stumbled upon an ancient cemetery. He is not permitted to relocate the corpses, despite that fact <b>that if he had found</b> the single corpse by itself <b>at first,</b> without being aware of the gravesite, he would have been permitted to <b>remove it and its surrounding</b> earth.
The Gemara analyzes that mishna. <b>The Master said:</b> If there is between them a distance <b>of four to eight</b> cubits, then it is presumed to be a graveyard. The reason is that corpses buried in this manner are indicative of the standard layout of a burial chamber. The fact that this is said only when the distance between the corpses is between four and eight cubits assumes that the size of a burial chamber is four cubits by eight cubits. Based on this, the Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is this? <b>If</b> it is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> in the mishna above (100b), <b>didn’t they say</b> that the size of a burial chamber is <b>four</b> cubits <b>by six</b> cubits? <b>If</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, didn’t he say</b> that a burial cave is <b>six</b> cubits <b>by eight</b> cubits?
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually</b> this mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, and it is</b> in accordance with another version of Rabbi Shimon’s opinion, which is cited by <b>this <i>tanna</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one found</b> three corpses lying <b>in</b> close <b>succession, and there is not</b> a distance <b>of four cubits to eight</b> cubits <b>between them,</b> i.e., they are lying closer together, <b>they have</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the requirement to move their <b>surrounding</b> earth in which they are buried. <b>But they are not</b> considered to be part of <b>a graveyard,</b> since permanent graves are not placed so closely together. Perforce, their corpses were originally buried there on a temporary basis, but then they were never reinterred. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabbi Shimon: The</b> corpses in <b>the middle are viewed as if they are not</b> there, i.e., as if they were buried there incidentally, <b>and the other</b> corpses thereby <b>combine</b> to form a graveyard in which corpses are found with a distance <b>of four cubits to eight</b> cubits between them.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with which opinion did you interpret</b> the mishna? If it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> then <b>say the latter clause</b> of that mishna: If he finds an area of graves, <b>he</b> must <b>examine from there outward twenty cubits</b> to discover whether there are other corpses buried there. Since the burial formation is indicative of burial within a burial chamber of a catacomb, he should continue to investigate the whole area that would be occupied by a catacomb. The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is this? <b>If</b> it is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon,</b> the distance one should be required to examine <b>would be twenty-two</b> cubits, which is the total length of a catacomb, i.e., two chambers of eight cubits with a courtyard of six cubits between them. <b>If</b> it is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> the distance one should be required to examine <b>would be eighteen</b> cubits, as each catacomb consists of two chambers of six cubits long with a chamber of six cubits between them.
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and</b> it is necessary to examine twenty cubits in a case <b>where he examined along the diagonal</b> of the catacomb, which is longer than its length.
The Gemara asks: <b>But since</b> he examined <b>this</b> chamber along <b>the diagonal, this</b> second chamber on the other side of the courtyard should <b>also</b> be examined along <b>the diagonal.</b> If so, that <b>would be twenty-two</b> cubits. The Gemara answers: <b>We say</b> he should examine <b>one</b> chamber along <b>the diagonal,</b> but <b>we do not say</b> he should examine <b>two</b> chambers along <b>the diagonal.</b>

Daf 102b

<b>Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: Actually,</b> the mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon, and here we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the corpses found were of <b>non-viable newborns</b> buried in a smaller chamber only six cubits long. Adding a courtyard of six cubits and another regular-sized chamber of eight cubits yields a total length of the catacomb of twenty cubits.
The Gemara asks: <b>But since this</b> is dealing <b>with</b> a chamber that was created for burying <b>non-viable newborns,</b> there too, with regard to <b>that</b> chamber, on the other side of the courtyard, we are dealing <b>with</b> a chamber created for <b>non-viable newborns as well.</b> Therefore, the total length of the catacomb <b>would be eighteen</b> cubits. The Gemara answers: <b>We say</b> that perhaps <b>one</b> of the chambers is <b>for non-viable newborns,</b> but <b>we do not say</b> that <b>two</b> chambers might have been constructed <b>for non-viable newborns.</b>
§ Above, the Gemara cited a <i>baraita</i> that relates a dispute between Rabbi Shimon and the Rabbis with regard to three corpses buried close together. The Rabbis hold that this is not considered a graveyard, whereas Rabbi Shimon maintains that it can be. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another ruling <b>of the Rabbis against</b> this ruling <b>of the Rabbis, and it</b> also <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another ruling <b>of Rabbi Shimon against</b> this ruling <b>of Rabbi Shimon.</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 5:2): With regard to <b>a vineyard that is planted on</b> an area where there is <b>less than four cubits</b> of open space between the vines, <b>Rabbi Shimon says: It is not</b> considered to be <b>a vineyard</b> with regard to the prohibition of diverse kinds and other <i>halakhot</i>, as it is overcrowded. <b>And the Rabbis say: This is</b> considered to be <b>a vineyard, and</b> the reason for this is that <b>the middle</b> vines are <b>viewed as if</b> they <b>are not</b> there, and the outer vines meet the requirements for a vineyard. Therefore, it is prohibited to plant other crops anywhere in that area.
The ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> in this mishna is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted <b>by</b> the ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, as there the Rabbis did not say: The middle ones are viewed as if they are not there. <b>And</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Shimon</b> in this mishna is <b>difficult,</b> as it is contradicted <b>by</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Shimon</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, as there he did say: The corpses in the middle are viewed as if they are not there.
The Gemara answers: The fact that one ruling <b>of Rabbi Shimon</b> is contradicted <b>by</b> the other ruling <b>of Rabbi Shimon</b> is <b>not difficult. There,</b> with regard to vineyards, Rabbi Shimon holds that middle vines cannot be disregarded, as <b>people do not plant</b> vines <b>with the intention of uprooting</b> them. But <b>here,</b> with regard to burial, <b>sometimes it happens</b> that one has to bury a corpse <b>at twilight</b> just before the onset of Shabbat, <b>and indiscriminately inters</b> the body between other corpses with the intention of reburying it at a later date.
Similarly, the fact that one ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> is contradicted <b>by</b> the other ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> with regard to burial, <b>since it is a disgrace</b> to bury bodies so close together, <b>it is not called</b> an area of <b>graves.</b> But <b>there,</b> with regard to vineyards, the owner of the vineyard <b>says</b> to himself: <b>Whichever of</b> the vines <b>will flourish, will flourish</b> and I will leave them, <b>and</b> whichever ones <b>do not flourish,</b> I will uproot them and <b>they will be for firewood.</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>If one says to another: I am selling you</b> a plot of <b>earth</b> of the size <b>required for sowing one <i>kor</i> of seed [<i>beit kor</i>],</b> and <b>there</b> on that plot <b>there were crevices</b> [<b><i>neka’im</i></b>] <b>ten handbreadths deep or rocks ten handbreadths high, they are not measured</b> together <b>with</b> the rest of the field. Rather, the buyer must be provided with land measuring a <i>beit kor</i> exclusive of those crevices or rocks. If the crevices or rocks measured <b>less than</b> ten handbreadths, <b>they are measured</b> together <b>with</b> the rest of the field. <b>But if</b> the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer: I am selling you a plot of <b>earth</b> that is <b>about</b> the size of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>,</b> then <b>even if there</b> on that plot <b>there were crevices deeper than ten handbreadths or rocks higher than ten handbreadths, they are measured</b> together <b>with</b> the rest of the field.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Arakhin</i> 25a): With regard to <b>one who consecrates his</b> ancestral <b>field during the time</b> that the <i>halakhot</i> <b>of the Jubilee</b> Year are practiced, if he wishes to redeem the field <b>he must give</b> the Temple treasurer <b>fifty silver shekels for</b> every <b>place that is fit for sowing a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed,</b> which is the biblical equivalent of a <i>kor</i>, for all the years of the Jubilee cycle, as this is the sum fixed by the Torah for this purpose (see Leviticus 27:16). But if <b>there were crevices ten handbreadths deep there,</b> in the field, <b>or rocks ten handbreadths high,</b>

Daf 103a

<b>they are not measured</b> together <b>with</b> the rest of the field. If the crevices or rocks were <b>less than</b> ten handbreadths, <b>they are measured</b> together <b>with</b> the rest of the field.
The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> are the crevices that are deeper and the rocks that are higher than ten handbreadths not measured with the rest of the field? <b>Let them</b> at least <b>be consecrated separately</b> and require their own redemption. <b>And if you would say that since they are not</b> the size of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>, they cannot be consecrated,</b> there is a difficulty.
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse: “And if he that sanctified the field will redeem it” (Leviticus 27:19): <b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state</b> the word <b>“field”?</b> Since the previous verses are all discussing a field, it would have sufficed for this verse to refer to the field with the pronoun: It. Rather, <b>as it is stated</b> in an earlier verse: “Then your valuation shall be according to the seed required for it; <b>a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver”</b> (Leviticus 27:16), <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of one who <b>consecrated in this manner,</b> i.e., an area fit to sow a <i>ḥomer</i> of barley seed.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>From where</b> do I learn that this <i>halakha</i> is also meant <b>to include</b> the case of one who consecrated a smaller area, e.g., an area fit to sow <b>a <i>letekh</i>,</b> i.e., a half-<i>kor</i>, <b>a half-<i>letekh</i>, a <i>se’a</i>, a <i>tarkav</i>, and a half-<i>tarkav</i>?</b> From where is it derived that these smaller plots of land can also be consecrated and redeemed in accordance with the fixed values stated in the Torah? <b>The verse states: “A field,”</b> teaching that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>in any case</b> of a field, even to smaller plots.
<b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama said: Here,</b> in the mishna in <i>Arakhin</i>, <b>we are dealing with crevices filled with water.</b> Being <b>that they are not fit for sowing,</b> they cannot be consecrated, as the verse states: “Then your valuation shall be according to the seed required for it” (Leviticus 27:16). The Gemara comments: The language of the mishna <b>is also precise</b> according to this interpretation, <b>as it teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> about crevices that are <b>similar to rocks,</b> which are certainly not fit for sowing. The Gemara affirms: <b>Learn from this</b> that this explanation is correct.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>If</b> this is <b>so,</b> that the crevices and rocks of the mishna are excluded from being consecrated because they are unfit for sowing, then <b>even</b> if they <b>are less than</b> ten handbreadths in depth or height, they <b>also</b> should not be consecrated. The Gemara answers: If the crevices or rocks are less than ten handbreadths deep or high, <b>these</b> crevices <b>are called the cracks of the earth,</b> and these rocks <b>are called the spines [<i>shidrei</i>] of the earth.</b> In other words, since they are considered standard features of the field and do not constitute separate areas, they are consecrated together with the rest of the field.
The Gemara asks: The <i>halakha</i> stated above was taught with regard to consecrated property. <b>Here,</b> in the case of a sale of land, with regard to which the mishna teaches that crevices ten handbreadths deep are not measured along with the land, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does that <i>halakha</i> apply only when the crevices are filled with water? <b>Rav Pappa said: Even if they are not filled with water</b> they are not considered part of the field. <b>What is the reason</b> that in the case of a sale crevices are not considered part of the field even if they are not filled with water? Because <b>a person</b> buying a field <b>does not want to give his money for</b> the purchase of <b>one plot when it appears to him like two or three</b> different <b>plots</b> due to differences in the height of the terrain. Therefore, those crevices that are ten handbreadths deep are not measured along with the rest of the field, regardless of whether or not they are filled with water.
<b>Ravina objects to this: But</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> about crevices in a manner indicating that they are <b>similar to</b> the <b>rocks</b> discussed in the mishna. <b>Just as rocks are not fit for sowing, so too, these</b> crevices are such <b>that they are not fit for sowing.</b> But if they are not filled with water, and are therefore fit for sowing, then even if they are lower than the rest of the field, they should be included in the sale. The Gemara replies: <b>When</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> about crevices in a manner indicating that they are <b>similar to</b> the <b>rocks</b> discussed in the mishna, it teaches about crevices that <b>are less than that,</b> i.e., less than ten handbreadths deep. In such a case, even if they are not fit for sowing, they are measured along with the rest of the field.
§ The mishna teaches that if the crevices or rocks in the field measured <b>less than</b> ten handbreadths, <b>they are measured</b> together <b>with</b> the rest of the field. <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says: The rocks</b> or crevices that measure less than ten handbreadths <b>that</b> the Sages <b>said</b> are measured together with the rest of the field must not measure more than <b>an area required for sowing four <i>kav</i></b> of seed within an area required for sowing a <i>kor</i>. <b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama says: This applies</b> specifically <b>where</b> the rocks <b>are scattered throughout an area required for sowing five <i>kav</i>. Rav Ḥiyya bar Abba</b> says that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: This applies</b> specifically <b>where</b> the rocks <b>are scattered throughout the greater part of the field.</b>
<b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba raises a dilemma</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> taught in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan: If <b>the majority of</b> the rocks are scattered <b>throughout the smaller part</b> of the field, <b>and the minority of</b> the rocks are scattered <b>throughout the greater part</b> of the field, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara answers: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved, as no answer was found.
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya raises</b> another <b>dilemma:</b>

Daf 103b

If the rocks are scattered throughout the greater part of the field but are arranged <b>like a ring, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If the rocks stand <b>in a row, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If the rocks form <b>an angle, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If they are arranged in the shape of <b>a crooked path, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara states: All these dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If there is a solitary rock</b> on the outskirts of the field, <b>even</b> if it is of <b>a minimal</b> size, <b>it is not measured</b> together <b>with</b> the rest of the field. <b>And</b> further, <b>if</b> that rock <b>is adjacent to the</b> field’s <b>border, even</b> if it is of <b>a minimal</b> size, <b>it is not measured</b> together <b>with</b> the rest of the field.
<b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma:</b> If <b>earth intervenes between</b> the rock and the border of the field, so that the rock does not actually touch the border, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara states: This dilemma as well <b>shall stand</b> unresolved. <b>Rav Ashi raises</b> another <b>dilemma:</b> If there was a layer of <b>earth below and rock above, or earth above and rock below, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara states: This dilemma as well <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one says to another: <b>I am selling you</b> a plot of <b>earth</b> the size of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>, measured</b> precisely <b>with a rope,</b> and <b>he gave</b> him even <b>the slightest amount less</b> than what was stipulated, the seller <b>must deduct</b> the difference from the purchase price of the field and return money to the buyer. If <b>he gave</b> him even <b>the slightest amount more</b> than what was stipulated, the buyer <b>must return</b> the difference to the seller. <b>And if</b> the seller <b>said</b> to the buyer that he is selling him a <i>beit kor</i> of land <b>more or less,</b> then <b>even if he gave</b> him <b>a quarter</b><i>-kav</i> <b>per <i>se’a</i> less</b> than what was stipulated, <b>or he gave him a quarter</b><i>-kav</i> <b>per <i>se’a</i> more</b> that what was stipulated, i.e., he gave him one twenty-fourth more or less than what was required, <b>it is his.</b> The sale is valid, since the seller told the buyer in advance that he was not committing himself to precise measurements. If the difference is <b>greater than that</b> amount, <b>he must make a calculation,</b> and the party that suffered a loss must be compensated.
If the buyer received too much land, so that he must now compensate the seller, <b>what does he return to him?</b> He returns <b>money,</b> i.e., he pays the seller for the surplus land. <b>And if</b> the seller so <b>wishes,</b> the buyer <b>returns</b> the surplus <b>land to him. Why</b> then <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that <b>he returns money to him?</b> They said this <b>in order to enhance the power of the seller,</b> and enable him to demand payment for the surplus land, rather than accept its return. <b>As, if the surplus in the field was an area required for sowing nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed, <b>and in a garden an area required for sowing a half-<i>kav</i></b> of seed, <b>or, according to the statement of Rabbi Akiva, an area required for sowing a quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> of seed (see 11a), the buyer must <b>return the land</b> itself <b>to</b> the seller, and the seller cannot demand payment in money. <b>And</b> if the surplus is greater than a quarter-<i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>, <b>it is not only the quarter</b>-<i>kav</i> <b>that he returns; rather,</b> he returns <b>all of the surplus.</b> Since he is already required to make a refund, the refund must be made in the precise amount.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna considers two cases of selling a <i>beit kor</i> of land: First, where the seller said that he is selling a <i>beit kor</i> measured precisely with a rope, in which case a refund must be made no matter how small the deviation; and second, where the seller said that he selling a <i>beit kor</i> more or less, in which case the sale is valid as long as the deviation is no more than a quarter-<i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>. In connection with these cases, <b>a dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one says he is selling <b>a <i>beit kor</i></b> of land, and he said this <b>without</b> any further <b>specification, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a solution from what was taught in the mishna: If one says to another: <b>I am selling you</b> a plot of <b>earth</b> the size of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>, measured</b> precisely <b>with a rope,</b>

Daf 104a

and he gave him even <b>the slightest amount less</b> that what was stipulated, the seller <b>must deduct</b> the difference from the purchase price of the field and return money to the buyer. If he gave him even <b>the slightest amount more</b> than what was stipulated, the buyer <b>must return</b> the difference to the seller. The reason that even the slightest difference in value must be returned is that the seller specified that he was selling land measured precisely with a rope. <b>But</b> had he sold the land <b>without</b> further <b>specification,</b> it would be <b>like</b> he sold it saying that it is a <i>beit kor</i> <b>more or less.</b>
The Gemara rejects this argument by proposing another, completely opposite proof: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>And if</b> the seller <b>said to</b> the buyer that he is selling him a <i>beit kor</i> of land <b>more or less,</b> then <b>even if he gave</b> him <b>one-quarter of a <i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i> less</b> than what was stipulated, <b>or he gave him one-quarter of a <i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i> more</b> than what was stipulated, <b>it is his</b> and the sale is valid. One can infer: The reason that the sale is valid is that he specified that he was selling a <i>beit kor</i> of land more or less. <b>But</b> had he sold the land <b>without</b> further <b>specification,</b> it would be <b>like</b> he sold it saying that he was selling the land <b>measured</b> precisely <b>with a rope. Rather,</b> since the mishna can be interpreted in two opposite ways, <b>no</b> inference is <b>to be learned from</b> the mishna.
The Gemara tries to present another proof: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If the seller said to the buyer: <b>I am selling you</b> a plot of <b>earth</b> the size of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>;</b> or he said to him: <b>I am selling you</b> a plot of <b>earth about</b> the size of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>;</b> or he said to him: <b>I am selling you</b> a <i>beit kor</i> <b>more or less;</b> then <b>even if he gave</b> him <b>one-quarter of a <i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i> less</b> than what was stipulated, <b>or he gave him one-quarter of a <i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i> more</b> than what was stipulated, <b>it is his</b> and the sale is valid. One can infer: <b>Apparently,</b> selling a <i>beit kor</i> of land <b>without</b> further <b>specification</b> is <b>also like</b> selling it <b>more or less.</b> The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>There,</b> the <i>tanna</i> <b>is explaining</b> his statement, which should be understood as follows: <b>When is</b> the phrase <b>a <i>beit kor</i></b> treated like the phrase <b>about</b> the size of <b>a <i>beit kor</i>?</b> In a case <b>where</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer: I am selling you a <i>beit kor</i> <b>more or less.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi objects to this: If that is so,</b> then <b>why do I</b> need to repeat the words: <b>I am selling you,</b> three times? The fact that the <i>baraita</i> repeats these words in each clause indicates that it is discussing three separate sale transactions, and not that the three clauses are all referring to one case. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that selling a <i>beit kor</i> of land <b>without</b> further <b>specification</b> is <b>like</b> selling it <b>more or less?</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that this is so.
§ With regard to a buyer who received too much land and now must compensate the seller, the mishna teaches: <b>What does he return to him?</b> He pays him <b>money,</b> and if the seller so wishes, the buyer returns the surplus land to him, because the Sages said that the buyer pays money in order to enhance the power of the seller. In other words, the Sages allowed the seller to choose whether to take back the surplus land or to demand payment for it from the buyer, even though this effectively forces the buyer to purchase the surplus land from him. The Gemara asks: Is it correct that <b>we say</b> that <b>the seller’s power should be enhanced, and</b> that <b>we do not say</b> that <b>the buyer’s power should be enhanced?</b>
But <b>isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> the seller <b>gave</b> the buyer <b>seven and a half <i>kav</i> per <i>kor</i> less</b> than what was stipulated, which is the equivalent of a quarter<i>-kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>, as a <i>kor</i> is equal to thirty <i>se’a</i>, <b>or he gave him seven and a half <i>kav</i> per <i>kor</i> more</b> than what was stipulated, <b>it is his</b> and the sale is valid. If the difference is <b>greater than that</b> amount, the court <b>compels the seller to sell and the buyer to buy</b> the difference. This indicates that we also say that the buyer’s power should be enhanced, since if the buyer so wishes, the seller is compelled to sell him land and accept payment for it.
The Gemara replies: <b>There,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is not discussing a case where the buyer wishes to acquire the surplus land, but rather with a case <b>where</b> the land <b>was initially,</b> at the time of the sale, <b>expensive, but now it is cheap,</b> and the seller wants the buyer to pay him for the surplus land according to the initial higher rate. In this case, <b>we say to</b> the seller, in the name of the buyer: <b>If you</b> wish to <b>give me land</b> and receive money, <b>give me</b> the land <b>according to the current, cheaper rate.</b> This is what the <i>baraita</i> is referring to when it states that the seller is compelled to sell.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>When he gives him</b> money in payment for the surplus land, <b>he gives</b> it <b>to him according to the rate at which he had bought</b> the rest of the land <b>from him?</b> The Gemara replies: <b>There</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the land <b>was initially cheap but now it is expensive.</b> If, in such a case, the seller wants the buyer to pay him for the surplus land, he is compelled to sell it to him according to the cheap rate from the time of the original sale.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>As, if the surplus in the field was an area required for the sowing of nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed, and in a garden an area required for the sowing of a half-<i>kav</i> of seed, or, according to the Rabbi Akiva, an area required for the sowing of a quarter-<i>kav</i> of seed, the buyer can return the surplus land to the seller, and the seller cannot demand payment in money. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> <b>that was stated</b> in the mishna, that a surplus in the size of an area required for the sowing of <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed can be returned to the seller, applies <b>even in a large valley</b> which measures several <i>kor</i>. If the surplus is a significant plot of land equal in size to an area required for the sowing of nine <i>kav</i> of seed, the buyer can return it to the seller, even if it is less than one-quarter of a <i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>, i.e., less than one twenty-fourth the size of the field that was sold.
<b>And Rav Naḥman says: He calculates seven and a half <i>kav</i> for each and every <i>kor</i>,</b> which is equivalent to one-quarter of a <i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>. As long as the surplus does not exceed that ratio, he is not required to return it, even if the surplus is greater than the area required for the sowing of nine <i>kav</i>.

Daf 104b

<b>And if</b> after this calculation <b>there is</b> still <b>a surplus</b> in excess of a quarter-<i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>, equal in size to an area required <b>for</b> the sowing of <b>nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed, the entire surplus must be <b>returned.</b>
<b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman:</b> The mishna teaches <b>that if the surplus in the field was an area required for the sowing of nine <i>kav</i></b> of seed, the buyer returns the land to the seller. <b>Isn’t this</b> the <i>halakha</i> even in a case <b>where he sold him</b> a field measuring <b>two <i>kor</i>?</b> This would seem to indicate that even if the surplus does not exceed a quarter-<i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>, as a quarter-<i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i> in a field of two <i>kor</i> is fifteen <i>kav</i>, the sole determining factor is whether or not the surplus is equal in size to an area required for the sowing of nine <i>kav</i>. Rav Naḥman rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> the case in the mishna is specifically <b>where he sold him a</b> field measuring one <b><i>kor</i>.</b>
Rava raised a further objection to Rav Naḥman: We learned in the continuation of the mishna that if the surplus <b>in a garden</b> was <b>an area required for the sowing of a half-<i>kav</i></b> of seed, the buyer returns the land to the seller. <b>Isn’t this</b> the <i>halakha</i> even in a case <b>where he sold him</b> a garden measuring <b>two <i>se’a</i>?</b> Once again, this would seem to indicate that the surplus is returned to the seller, provided that it is equal in size to the minimum measure of a garden, even if the surplus does not exceed one-half of a <i>kav</i> per two <i>se’a</i>, which is equivalent to one-quarter of a <i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>. Rav Naḥman rejects this argument as well: <b>No,</b> the case in the mishna is <b>where he sold him a</b> garden measuring a <b><i>se’a</i>,</b> so that the surplus is proportionately twice as large.
Rava raised yet another objection to Rav Naḥman from the next clause in the mishna, which states: <b>Or, according to the statement of Rabbi Akiva,</b> if the surplus in the garden was <b>an area required for sowing a quarter-<i>kav</i> of seed,</b> the buyer returns the land to the seller. <b>What, isn’t this</b> the <i>halakha</i> even in a case <b>where he sold him a</b> garden measuring <b>a <i>se’a</i>?</b> In that case, the surplus does not exceed one-quarter of a <i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>, and nevertheless the surplus is returned to the seller, provided that it is equal in size to the minimum measure of a garden. Rav Naḥman also rejects this argument: <b>No,</b> the case in the mishna is <b>where he sold him</b> a garden measuring <b>a half-<i>se’a</i>,</b> so that the surplus is proportionately twice as large.
The mishna teaches that in the case of a field, the buyer can return the land itself if the surplus was an area required for the sowing of nine <i>kav</i> of seed, and in the case of a garden, if the surplus was an area required for the sowing of a half-<i>kav</i> of seed. <b>Rav Ashi raises a dilemma:</b> If one sold <b>a field and it</b> turned out that the plot was larger than had been stipulated, but before the buyer returned the surplus, the plot <b>was turned into a garden, or</b> if it was initially <b>a garden and it was turned into a field</b> (see 11a), <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is the surplus governed by the <i>halakhot</i> applying to a field or by those applying to a garden? The Gemara answers: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved, as no answer has been found.
A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>If</b> the field being sold <b>was adjacent to</b> another <b>field</b> belonging to the seller, <b>then even</b> if the surplus was of <b>a minimal</b> amount, the buyer can <b>return the land</b> itself <b>to</b> the seller, and the seller cannot demand payment in money. This is because the seller loses nothing when he receives a small tract of land, as he can cultivate it along with his adjoining field.
<b>Rav Ashi raises</b> a set of <b>dilemmas:</b> With regard to <b>a pit</b> between the surplus in the sold field and the adjoining field belonging to the seller, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>: <b>Should</b> the pit <b>be</b> considered <b>an interposition</b> between the two fields? With regard to <b>a water channel</b> between the two fields, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>: <b>Should</b> the water channel <b>be</b> considered <b>an interposition?</b> With regard to <b>the public thoroughfare, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>: <b>Should</b> the public thoroughfare <b>be</b> considered <b>an interposition?</b> With regard to <b>a row of palm trees, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>: <b>Should</b> a row of palm trees <b>be</b> considered <b>an interposition?</b> The Gemara states: All these dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The mishna teaches that if the surplus is greater than a quarter-<i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>, <b>it is not only the quarter-</b><i>kav</i> <b>that</b> the buyer <b>returns; rather,</b> he returns <b>all of the surplus.</b> Since he is already required to make a refund, the refund must be made in the precise amount. The Gemara raises a question: <b>Isn’t it the opposite</b> [<b><i>kelappei layya</i></b>]? The buyer is required to return the surplus even when the quarters of a <i>kav</i> remain in his possession. <b>Ravin bar Rav Naḥman taught</b> the mishna as follows: <b>Not only must</b> the buyer <b>return the extra</b> land that is beyond the limit of a quarter<i>-kav</i> area per <i>beit se’a</i>, <b>but he must</b> also <b>return to him every one of the</b> extra <b>quarter-</b><i>kav</i> areas of land that he received beyond the stated area of a <i>beit kor</i>. When he is required to return the surplus, he returns not only the surplus, but also all the quarter-<i>kav</i> areas over and above what had originally been stipulated to be included in the sale.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If the seller says to the buyer: <b>I am selling you</b> a plot of land of a certain size <b>measured</b> precisely <b>with a rope more or less,</b> thereby attaching to the sale two contradictory stipulations; in this case, the words: <b>More or less, nullify</b> the words: <b>Measured</b> precisely <b>with a rope.</b> Accordingly, if the surplus did not exceed a quarter-<i>kav</i> per <i>se’a</i>, the sale is valid as is. Similarly, if the seller says to the buyer: I am selling you a plot of land of a certain size <b>more or less measured</b> precisely <b>with a rope,</b>

Daf 105a

the words: <b>Measured</b> precisely <b>with a rope, nullify</b> the words: <b>More or less,</b> since the principle is that in all cases, one should attend to the final expression; this is <b>the statement of ben Nanas.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel says</b> that <b>Rav says: Ben Nanas’s colleagues disagree with him</b> with regard to his ruling that one should attend to the final expression. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> new <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> Rav <b>teaching us?</b> Don’t <b>we</b> already <b>learn</b> that they disagree from a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 102a): There was once <b>an incident in Tzippori involving one who rented a bathhouse from another,</b> and it was stated that the rental fee would be <b>twelve gold dinars</b> [<b><i>zehuvim</i></b>] <b>a year, one gold</b> dinar <b>per month,</b> and the year was later intercalated, an extra month being added.
<b>The incident came before Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and before Rabbi Yosei</b> for a decision as to whether the intercalated month is included in the words: Twelve gold dinars a year, or whether an additional payment must be made for that month, as the agreement stipulated: One gold dinar per month. <b>And they said:</b> The landlord and the tenant <b>should divide the intercalated month</b> between them, and so the tenant should pay only half a gold dinar for it. This indicates that these Sages ruled that the meaning of an agreement containing two contradictory expressions is in doubt, and therefore the parties divide the disputed amount between them. From here it follows that they disagree with the opinion of ben Nanas, who says that in such a case one should attend to the final expression.
The Gemara replies: <b>If</b> the Sages’ opinion was derived only <b>from there,</b> I would not know that they disagree with the opinion of ben Nanas in all cases, as <b>I would say</b> that <b>it is</b> only <b>there</b> that the Sages say that the parties divide the disputed sum between them. <b>As it is possible to say that</b> the landlord <b>retracted</b> his first statement and set the rental fee at one gold dinar per month, <b>but it is</b> also <b>possible to say that he is explaining</b> his earlier statement. That is to say, he did not mean to relate to the intercalated month; rather, he was clarifying that payment was to be made not with a lump sum at the end of the year, but in monthly installments. Since there is uncertainty with regard to his intention, the parties divide the contested sum between them. <b>But here</b> in the mishna, where the seller <b>certainly retracted</b> his first statement, one might <b>say</b> that the Sages do <b>not</b> disagree with ben Nanas. Therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that in all cases the Sages disagree with ben Nanas.
Similar to what was cited above in the name of Rav, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: This is the statement of ben Nanas,</b> who says with regard to a case of contradictory expressions that one should attend to the final expression; <b>but the Sages say: Follow the least inclusive expression,</b> the one that is the least advantageous to the buyer, in keeping with the principle that in a case of uncertainty, the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.
The Gemara asks: Did Shmuel mean to say that <b>this</b> is the statement of ben Nanas, <b>but</b> he, Shmuel, <b>does not agree with him? But don’t Rav and Shmuel both say:</b> If the seller said to the buyer: <b>I am selling you a <i>kor</i></b> of grain, an amount equivalent to thirty <i>se’a</i>, <b>for</b> the sum of <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>he can renege</b> on the entire sale <b>even while</b> measuring out <b>the last <i>se’a</i>.</b> Since the seller stipulated that he was selling a full <i>kor</i> of grain, as long as he has not yet measured out the full amount, he may still renege, as the sale is not yet complete.
But if the seller said to the buyer: <b>I am selling you a <i>kor</i></b> of grain <b>for thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, each <b><i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>,</b> the buyer <b>acquires</b> each <i>se’a</i> <b>one by one</b> as it is being measured out to him. Since the seller specified the price per <i>sela</i>, he has indicated that he is ready to sell each <i>sela</i> on its own. This seems to indicate that Shmuel maintains that in a case of contradictory expressions, one should attend to the final expression. <b>Rather,</b> Shmuel’s formulation: This is the statement of ben Nanas, must be explained as follows: <b>This</b> is the statement of ben Nanas, <b>and he,</b> Shmuel, <b>agrees with him</b> that one should attend to the final expression.
The Gemara asks: <b>And does</b> Shmuel actually <b>agree with him? But doesn’t Shmuel say:</b> Concerning the ruling of the Sages that the landlord and the tenant should divide the intercalated month between them, <b>we are dealing with</b> a case <b>where</b> the landlord <b>came</b> to collect the rent <b>in the middle of the month.</b> Only in that case is the disputed rent divided between them. <b>But</b> in a case where <b>he came</b> to collect the rent <b>at the beginning of the month, the entire</b> sum goes <b>to the landlord</b> who is demanding payment, since he is in possession of the property. And if he came <b>at the end of the month, the entire</b> sum goes <b>to the tenant</b> who is refusing payment, since he is in possession of the money. This indicates that Shmuel maintains that in a case of contradictory expressions, one should not attend to the latter expression. Rather, the case is viewed as one of uncertainty, and the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.

Daf 105b

<b>Rather,</b> it must be that Shmuel <b>actually</b> meant to say that <b>this</b> is the statement of ben Nanas, <b>but he,</b> Shmuel, <b>does not agree with him</b> that one should attend to the latter expression. In fact, he is in agreement with the Sages who maintain that two contradictory expressions create a case of uncertainty. <b>And there,</b> in the case of the rent for the intercalated month, <b>what is the reason</b> for his ruling that if the landlord came to collect the rent at the beginning of the month, the entire sum goes to the landlord, whereas if he came at the end of the month, the money goes to the tenant? <b>Because</b> the party who is awarded the money <b>was</b> seen as already being <b>in possession</b> of it, and in a case of uncertainty, money is left in the hands of the party enjoying possession.
<b>Here too,</b> in the case where the seller says that he is selling a <i>kor</i> of grain for thirty <i>sela</i>, each <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>, the buyer was seen as already being <b>in possession</b> of each <i>se’a</i> that was measured out to him, and therefore the seller cannot renege on the sale. It is for this reason that the buyer acquires the grain, and not because of the principle that in a case of contradictory expressions, one should attend to the latter expression.
On a similar topic, <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>they say</b> in <b>the school of Rav:</b> If the seller said to the buyer: I am selling you this item for <b>an <i>istera</i>, one hundred <i>ma’a</i>,</b> an <i>istera</i> being a silver coin equal to ninety-six copper <i>ma’a</i>, it is assumed he meant <b>one hundred <i>ma’a</i>.</b> And if the seller reversed the order and said that he was selling the item for <b>one hundred <i>ma’a</i>, an <i>istera</i>,</b> it is assumed he meant <b>an <i>istera</i>.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> new <i>halakha</i> <b>is</b> Rav <b>teaching us?</b> Is it that with regard to a statement comprised of contradictory expressions <b>one should attend</b> only to <b>the last statement? Didn’t Rav</b> already <b>say this</b> on <b>another occasion? As Rav says: Had I been there</b> as a judge when the ruling was issued with regard to the rental fee for the intercalated month, <b>I would have given the entire</b> month’s rent <b>to the landlord,</b> based on the final expression in the rental agreement: One gold dinar per month.
The Gemara answers: Nevertheless, it was necessary to state both rulings, as the one cannot necessarily be inferred from the other. <b>If this</b> <i>halakha</i> with regard to the <i>istera</i> <b>was stated and that</b> <i>halakha</i> with regard to the intercalated month <b>was not stated, I would say</b> that when the seller uttered the second expression: One hundred <i>ma’a</i>, <b>he retracted his</b> first expression: An <i>istera</i>, as the two expressions contradict one another, and for that reason Rav said that one should attend to the final expression. <b>But here,</b> in the case of the intercalated month, <b>perhaps you</b> would <b>say</b> that when the landlord utters the second expression: One gold dinar per month, <b>he is explaining</b> the original intent of his first expression: Twelve gold dinars a year, and one should view it as a clarification. Therefore Rav comes and <b>teaches us</b> that in all cases one should attend to the final expression.

Daf 106a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one sells a field to another, telling him that he is selling him a field measuring a <i>beit kor</i>, <b>with its</b> particular <b>demarcations and borders</b> that the seller specifies for the buyer, the field’s measurement is not treated in as exacting a manner as in a standard sale. Therefore, if it later turns out that the field was not precisely a <i>beit kor</i>, but the difference is still <b>less than one-sixth,</b> the field <b>is</b> the buyer’s, and the sale is valid as is. But if the difference is greater, e.g., one-quarter or one-fifth, then, <b>until</b> it is calculated at <b>one-sixth,</b> the seller <b>must deduct</b> the difference from the purchase price and return money to the buyer.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about the following issue: <b>Rav Huna says:</b> A difference that is precisely <b>one-sixth is like</b> one that is <b>less than one-sixth,</b> and the sale is valid. <b>Rav Yehuda says:</b> A difference that is precisely <b>one-sixth is like</b> one that is <b>more than one-sixth,</b> and the difference must be deducted from the purchase price.
The Gemara explains the respective reasons of the two <i>amora’im</i>: <b>Rav Huna says</b> that a difference of <b>one-sixth is like</b> a difference of <b>less than one-sixth,</b> as <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> If the difference is <b>less than one-sixth, and including</b> a difference that is precisely <b>one-sixth, it is</b> the buyer’s, as the sale is valid, and if it is <b>more than one-sixth,</b> the seller <b>must deduct</b> the difference from the purchase price. <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that a difference of <b>one-sixth is like</b> a difference of <b>more than one-sixth,</b> as <b>this</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> If the difference is <b>less than one-sixth, it is</b> the buyer’s, as the sale is valid, and if the difference is greater, <b>until</b> it is calculated at <b>one-sixth, and including</b> a difference that is precisely <b>one-sixth,</b> the seller <b>must deduct</b> the difference from the purchase price.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to Rav Huna’s statement from a <i>baraita</i>: If one sells a field to another, telling him that he is selling him a field measuring a <i>beit kor</i> <b>within its</b> particular <b>demarcations and borders,</b> and <b>he gave</b> him a field that is <b>one-sixth less</b> than the measure stipulated, <b>or,</b> alternatively, <b>he gave</b> him a field that is <b>one-sixth more</b> than the measure stipulated, <b>it is like</b> a sale of orphans’ property that is executed in accordance with <b>the judges’ assessment</b> of the value of that property, and therefore <b>it is</b> the buyer’s, as the sale is valid. The Gemara states the objection: <b>But</b> in the case of a sale executed in accordance with <b>the judges’ assessment,</b> an error of precisely <b>one-sixth is like</b> an error of <b>more than one-sixth,</b> and the sale is void. This contradicts Rav Huna’s opinion that an error of one-sixth is like an error of less than one-sixth.
The Gemara answers: <b>Rav Huna</b> could have <b>said to you</b> in reply: Even <b>according to your reasoning,</b> there is still a difficulty, since the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches</b> that <b>it is</b> the buyer’s, i.e., the sale is final. <b>Rather,</b> the comparison drawn between this <i>halakha</i> and the judges’ assessment is not a general comparison. It is <b>like the judges’ assessment, but</b> it is <b>not</b> entirely <b>like the judges’ assessment.</b> It is <b>like the judges’ assessment</b> in that the limit is <b>one-sixth, but it is not like the judges’ assessment, as there,</b> in the case of the judges’ assessment, <b>the sale is voided, while here,</b> in the mishna, <b>it is</b> the buyer’s, and the sale is final.
It is related that <b>Rav Pappa bought land from a certain man,</b>

Daf 106b

who, after specifying its demarcations and boundaries, <b>said to him: It is</b> an area of <b>twenty <i>griv</i>,</b> meaning that it is fit for planting twenty <i>se’a</i> of grain. Rav Pappa later <b>measured</b> the field <b>and</b> found that <b>it was</b> fit for planting <b>only fifteen</b> <i>se’a</i>. Rav Pappa <b>came before Abaye</b> to sue the seller. Abaye <b>said to him: You knew</b> what you were buying <b>and accepted</b> the field as is.
Rav Pappa raised an objection to Abaye’s ruling from the mishna. <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that when the seller specifies the field’s demarcations and borders, if the difference between the stated size of the field and its actual size is <b>less than one-sixth,</b> the field <b>is</b> the buyer’s, and the sale is valid as is, but if the difference is greater, <b>until</b> it is calculated at <b>one-sixth,</b> the seller <b>must deduct</b> the difference from the purchase price? And here, in this case, the difference between what the seller promised and the actual size of the field is greater than one-sixth. Abaye replied: <b>That statement</b> applies in a case <b>where</b> the buyer <b>is unfamiliar with</b> the plot being sold to him, <b>but</b> in a case <b>where he is familiar with it, he knew</b> what he was buying <b>and accepted</b> it as is.
Rav Pappa raised another objection to Abaye’s ruling: <b>But</b> the seller <b>said</b> to <b>me</b> that the field is fit for planting <b>twenty</b> <i>se’a</i>, and it is not. Abaye <b>said to him:</b> What he meant was <b>that</b> the field <b>is</b> as <b>good</b> and as fruitful <b>as</b> one that is fit for planting <b>twenty</b> <i>se’a</i>.
§ <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> When <b>brothers divide</b> their father’s estate between them by lottery, i.e., after dividing the property into equal shares they draw lots to determine which brother is to receive which portion, <b>once the lot for one of them is drawn, they all acquire</b> the remainder of the property, and they can no longer retract their decision to divide the estate in this manner. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Drawing lots is not one of the recognized modes of acquisition. <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that applies here is <b>similar to the initial</b> division of <b>Eretz Yisrael</b> among the tribes. <b>Just as the initial</b> division of Eretz Yisrael was carried out <b>by</b> drawing <b>lots, so too here,</b> the brothers can divide their father’s estate <b>by</b> drawing <b>lots.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>If</b> the brothers’ division of their father’s estate is comparable to the initial division of Eretz Yisrael, an additional comparison should apply: <b>Just as there,</b> the initial division of Eretz Israel was carried out <b>through a receptacle [<i>bekalpi</i>]</b> in which lots were placed <b>and the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>, so too here,</b> the division of the father’s estate should be executed only <b>through a receptacle and the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>. Rav Ashi said: With the satisfaction</b> that each of the brothers receives from the fact <b>that they listen to each other</b> and agree to accept the results of the lottery, <b>they fully transfer</b> ownership <b>to each other.</b> Therefore, the division becomes final as soon as the first lot is drawn.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about a related issue: If <b>two brothers divided</b> their father’s estate between them, <b>and</b> then later a third <b>brother,</b> of whose existence they had previously been unaware, <b>arrived from a country overseas, Rav says: The</b> original <b>division</b> of the property <b>is void,</b> and the brothers must now redivide the property among the three of them. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> The original division is still valid, but the two brothers must each <b>take off a share</b> from their portion and give it to the third brother.
The Gemara clarifies the opinions of Rav and Shmuel: <b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: According to Rav, who says that the division is void, apparently</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that if a division of property was found to have been performed in error, <b>the</b> original <b>verdict is reconsidered</b> and the entire division is void. Accordingly, in the case of the brother who arrived from overseas, the original division of the father’s estate is void. <b>But if that is so,</b> then in the case of <b>these three</b> people <b>who stand</b> as partners, <b>and two of them go and divide</b> the property into three parts without consulting with the third partner, <b>so too, the division should be void,</b> and it should be necessary to divide the property a second time between the three partners. But elsewhere (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 31b), the Gemara indicates that in such a case, if the division of property took place in the presence of a court, it is valid.
Rav Naḥman rejects this comparison: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared?</b> There is a clear difference between them: <b>There,</b> in the case of the three partners, <b>they entered</b> the process of dividing the property <b>from the outset with the knowledge that they were three,</b> and it was necessary only to clarify the portion to be received by each partner. <b>Here,</b> in the case of the brother who arrived from overseas, <b>they did not enter</b> the process of dividing the property <b>from the outset with the knowledge that they were three,</b> as at the time of the original division, they thought that there were only two brothers.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: According to Shmuel, who says</b> that the two brothers must each <b>take off a share</b> from their portion and give it to the third brother, <b>is this to say that</b> he is of the opinion <b>that</b> even if a division of property was found to have been made in error, <b>the</b> original <b>verdict stands</b> and the division is valid? <b>But don’t Rav and Shmuel both say</b> that if the seller said to the buyer: <b>I am selling you one <i>kor</i></b> of grain, an amount equivalent to thirty <i>se’a</i>, <b>for</b> the sum of <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>he can renege</b> on the entire sale <b>even while</b> measuring out <b>the last <i>se’a</i>;</b> but if he said: <b>I am selling you one <i>kor</i></b> of grain <b>for thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, <b>each <i>se’a</i> for a <i>sela</i>,</b> the buyer <b>acquires</b> each <i>se’a</i> <b>one by one</b> as it is being measured out to him? If the original verdict stands, why in the first case may the seller renege even on that portion of the sale that already reached the buyer?

Daf 107a

The Gemara answers: The cases cannot be compared because <b>there,</b> in the case of the sale of grain, <b>the Sages instituted a matter that is suitable for the seller and</b> also <b>suitable for the buyer.</b> Since the price of grain fluctuates, neither party wants the sale to be considered complete until the last <i>se’a</i> is measured out, so that they each are able to renege on the sale should the price rise or fall. This reasoning does not apply in cases of division of property.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed about another related matter: If <b>two brothers divided</b> their father’s estate between them, <b>and</b> then their father’s <b>creditor came and took the portion of one of them</b> as repayment for the father’s debt, <b>Rav says: The</b> original <b>division</b> of the property <b>is void,</b> and the brothers must now redivide the remaining assets. <b>Shmuel says:</b> Each brother, upon receiving his portion, <b>has foregone</b> his right to be reimbursed if his portion is lost. <b>Rav Asi says:</b> The brother whose portion was seized is entitled to half the remaining inheritance: <b>He takes one-quarter in land and one-quarter in money.</b>
The Gemara explains the rationale for each opinion: <b>Rav says</b> that <b>the</b> original <b>division</b> of the property <b>is void.</b> This is because <b>he holds that brothers who divided</b> property received as an inheritance <b>are</b> still considered to be <b>heirs</b> with regard to the inheritance as if they never divided the property, so that they continue to share joint responsibility for their father’s debts. Therefore, if a creditor seizes the portion received by one of them, it is as if he repaid the debt on behalf of all the heirs. Accordingly, they must once again divide the remaining property between them.
<b>And Shmuel says</b> that each brother, upon receiving his portion, <b>has foregone</b> his right to be reimbursed if his portion is lost, <b>as he holds</b> that <b>brothers who divided</b> property received as an inheritance <b>are</b> considered as <b>purchasers</b> from each other. <b>And</b> each one is considered <b>like a purchaser</b> who bought his portion <b>without a guarantee</b> that if the field is seized in payment of a debt, the seller will compensate the buyer for his loss. Accordingly, the brother whose portion of the estate was seized by the creditor has no claim against the brother whose portion remained untouched.
<b>Rav Asi is uncertain whether</b> brothers who divided property received as an inheritance <b>are</b> still considered to be <b>heirs or are</b> considered to be like <b>purchasers</b> who bought their property with a guarantee of compensation should the property be repossessed. <b>Therefore,</b> the brother whose portion was seized by the creditor is entitled to half the remaining inheritance, and <b>he takes one-quarter in land</b> like an heir <b>and one-quarter</b> he receives <b>in money,</b> like a purchaser with a guarantee, who is compensated with money for his loss.
<b>Rav Pappa says: The <i>halakha</i> in all</b> the cases dealt with in <b>these statements</b> recording disagreements between Rav and Shmuel is that the brothers must each <b>take off a share</b> from their portion in accordance with the opinion of Shmuel. Rather, any brother currently in possession of his portion must give part of it to his brother who lacks a portion, so that in the end they have equal shares. <b>Ameimar says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> in all of these cases is that <b>the</b> original <b>division</b> of the property <b>is void,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav. The Gemara concludes: <b>The <i>halakha</i> is</b> in fact that <b>the</b> original <b>division</b> of the property <b>is void,</b> in accordance with the opinion of Rav.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ketubot</i> 11:2): In a case of <b>three</b> experts <b>who went down to assess</b> a certain property in order to determine the amount to be collected from it for repayment of a debt, and <b>one says</b> it is worth <b>one hundred dinars, and</b> the other <b>two say</b> it is worth <b>two hundred,</b> or <b>one says</b> it is worth <b>two hundred</b> dinars <b>and</b> the other <b>two say</b> it is worth <b>one hundred,</b> the assessment of <b>the single</b> expert <b>is nullified, since</b> his is <b>the minority</b> opinion, and the assessment of the two others is accepted.
If <b>one says</b> the property is worth <b>one hundred dinars, and another says</b> it is worth <b>twenty</b> <i>sela</i>, which is equivalent to eighty dinars, since four dinars equal a <i>sela</i>, <b>and</b> yet <b>another says</b> it is worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, which is equivalent to one hundred and twenty dinars, <b>it is assessed at one hundred dinars,</b> which is the average of the assessments, as it is equivalent to twenty-five <i>sela</i>. <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says: It is assessed at ninety</b> dinars, as will be explained below. <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say: An appraisal</b> is <b>performed</b> of the sum <b>between</b> the two most extreme assessments <b>and</b> then <b>divided by three.</b> This sum is then added to the lowest assessment.
The Gemara clarifies the various opinions: <b>The one who says</b> that the property <b>is assessed at one hundred dinars</b> holds that <b>the middle</b> of the two extreme assessments is followed. <b>Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Tzadok, says</b> that <b>it is assessed at ninety</b> dinars because <b>he holds that this land</b>

Daf 107b

<b>is</b> in fact <b>worth ninety</b> dinars, <b>and the one who says</b> it is worth <b>twenty</b> <i>sela</i>, which is equivalent to eighty dinars <b>errs</b> with an assessment that is <b>ten</b> dinars <b>behind,</b> i.e., too low, <b>and the one who says</b> it is worth <b>one hundred dinars errs</b> with an assessment that is <b>ten</b> dinars <b>ahead,</b> i.e., too high. Therefore, the average of these two assessments is followed.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>On the contrary,</b> say that <b>this land is</b> in fact <b>worth one hundred and ten</b> dinars, <b>and the one who says</b> it is worth <b>one hundred dinars errs</b> with an assessment that is <b>ten</b> dinars <b>behind, and the one who says</b> it is worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, which is equivalent to one hundred and twenty dinars, <b>errs</b> with an assessment that is <b>ten</b> dinars <b>ahead.</b> If so, the average of these two assessments, one hundred and ten dinars, should be followed. The Gemara replies: <b>In any event, grasp the first two</b> assessments <b>in your hand, as neither</b> of them <b>takes</b> the assessment <b>beyond the sum of one hundred dinars.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b><i>Aḥerim</i> say</b> that <b>an appraisal</b> is <b>performed</b> of the sum <b>between</b> the two most extreme assessments <b>and</b> then <b>divided by three.</b> This sum is then added to the lowest assessment. The Gemara explains this opinion: <i>Aḥerim</i> <b>hold</b> that <b>this land is</b> in fact <b>worth ninety-three and one-third</b> dinars. <b>The one who says</b> it is worth <b>twenty</b> <i>sela</i>, the equivalent of eighty dinars, <b>errs</b> with an assessment that is <b>thirteen</b> dinars <b>and one-third behind,</b> and <b>the one who says it is</b> worth <b>one hundred dinars errs</b> with an assessment that is <b>thirteen</b> dinars <b>and one-third ahead. By right,</b> that assessor <b>should have said more,</b> i.e., quoted a higher sum, since according to this calculation, he should have said it is worth one hundred and six and two-thirds dinars. <b>And</b> the reason <b>that he did not</b> do so is that he <b>thinks</b> as follows: <b>It is enough that I add this much above</b> and beyond the assessment of <b>my colleague</b> who says it is worth eighty dinars. Therefore, he lowers the sum of his assessment to one hundred dinars.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>On the contrary,</b> say that <b>this land is</b> in fact <b>worth one hundred and thirteen</b> dinars <b>and one-third,</b> and <b>the one who says</b> it is worth <b>one hundred dinars errs</b> with an assessment that is <b>thirteen</b> dinars <b>and one-third behind, and the one who says</b> it is worth <b>thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, which is equal to one hundred and twenty dinars, <b>errs</b> with an assessment that is <b>thirteen</b> dinars <b>and one-third ahead. By right, he should have said more,</b> i.e., quoted a higher sum, since according to this calculation, he should have said it is worth one hundred and twenty-six dinars and two-thirds. And the reason he did not do so is that he <b>thinks</b> as follows: <b>It is enough that I add this much above</b> and beyond the assessment of <b>my colleague</b> who says it is worth one hundred dinars. The Gemara answers: <b>In any event, grasp the first two</b> assessments <b>in your hand, as neither</b> of them <b>take</b> the assessment <b>beyond the sum of one hundred dinars.</b>
<b>Rav Huna said: The <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of <i>Aḥerim</i>,</b> who say that the sum of the difference between the two most extreme assessments is calculated and then divided by three, and this sum is then added to the lowest assessment. <b>Rav Ashi said: We do not</b> even <b>understand the reason of <i>Aḥerim</i>; shall we</b> then <b>establish the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with their</b> opinion? <b>The judges of the Diaspora taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> that accords with the opinion of <i>Aḥerim</i> in the previously cited <i>baraita</i>: <b>An appraisal</b> is <b>performed</b> to determine the sum of the difference <b>between</b> the two most extreme assessments <b>and</b> then that sum is <b>divided by three</b> and added to the lowest assessment. <b>Rav Huna said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the judges of the Diaspora. Rav Ashi said: We do not</b> even <b>understand the reasoning of the judges of the Diaspora; shall we</b> then <b>establish the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with their</b> opinion?
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>If one says to another: I am selling you half a field,</b> without specifying which half he is selling, <b>an assessment is made</b> of the field, which is then divided <b>between them, and</b> the buyer <b>takes half of</b> the seller’s <b>field.</b> If the seller says: <b>I am selling you the half that is on the southern side</b> of the field, <b>an assessment is made</b> of the northern and the southern sides of the field, which is then divided <b>between them, and he takes the half on the southern side. And he accepts upon himself</b> to provide <b>the space for the fence</b> between the two halves of the field out of his own property. He also accepts to provide out of his own property the space for the larger <b>ditch and the smaller ditch,</b> which are meant to keep animals out of the field. <b>And how</b> wide <b>is</b> the larger <b>ditch? Six handbreadths. And</b> how wide is <b>the smaller ditch? Three</b> handbreadths.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> When one sells half of his field to another person, <b>the buyer takes the leaner part of</b> the field, the part that is of lower quality. <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that in such a case <b>an assessment is made</b> of the field, which is then divided <b>between them,</b> which indicates that the buyer and the seller are given similar parcels of land? How then can you say that the buyer takes the leaner part? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him</b> in a sarcastic manner: <b>While you were eating dates in Babylonia</b> and neglecting your studies, <b>we explained</b> the matter <b>based on the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which proves that my understanding is correct.
<b>As the latter clause teaches:</b> If the seller says: <b>I am selling you the half that is on the southern side</b> of the field, <b>an assessment is made</b> of the northern and the southern sides of the field, which is then divided <b>between them, and he takes the half on the southern side.</b> If taken literally, this passage gives rise to a difficulty: <b>Why is an assessment made</b> of the northern and the southern sides of the field, which is then divided <b>between them?</b> In any case, <b>didn’t he say to him</b> that he is selling him <b>the southern half?</b> Let the seller give the buyer the southern half of the field. Why is an assessment necessary? <b>Rather,</b> it must be that the matter is more complicated than it seems, and the mishna is referring <b>to money.</b> That is to say, the buyer takes the southern half, but the seller must reimburse him with money for the difference in value between the two halves of the field. <b>Here too,</b> in the first case, the mishna is referring <b>to money:</b> The buyer takes the leaner half, but the seller must reimburse him with money for the difference in value between the two halves of the field.
§ The mishna teaches that the buyer <b>accepts upon himself</b> to provide out of his own property <b>the space for the fence</b> between the two halves of the field and for the larger and smaller ditches. A Sage <b>taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The larger <b>ditch</b> is dug <b>on the outside, while the smaller ditch</b> is dug <b>on the inside,</b> closer to the field. Both <b>this and that</b> are dug <b>behind the fence,</b>

Daf 108a

<b>so that an animal will not jump</b> over the fence, enter the field, and cause damage. The Gemara asks: <b>Let him make</b> only a larger <b>ditch and not make a smaller ditch.</b> The Gemara replies: <b>Since</b> the ditch <b>is wide,</b> the animal <b>can stand inside it and jump</b> from there over the fence. The Gemara asks: If so, <b>then let him make</b> only <b>a smaller ditch and not make</b> a larger <b>ditch? Since the ditch is small,</b> the animal <b>stands on its edge and jumps</b> over the fence. The <i>baraita</i> explains the matter further: <b>And how much</b> space is there <b>between</b> the larger <b>ditch and the smaller ditch? One handbreadth.</b>

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>There are</b> family members who both <b>inherit</b> from <b>and bequeath</b> to each other upon their respective deaths; <b>and there are</b> those who <b>inherit</b> from certain relatives <b>but do not bequeath</b> to them; and there are those who <b>bequeath</b> to certain relatives <b>but do not inherit</b> from them; and there are those who, despite being relatives, <b>do not inherit</b> from <b>nor bequeath</b> to one another.
The mishna lists those referred to above. <b>And these</b> both <b>inherit and bequeath: A father</b> with regard to his <b>sons, and sons</b> with regard to their <b>father, and paternal brothers;</b> all <b>inherit</b> from one another <b>and bequeath</b> to each other. <b>A man</b> with regard to <b>his mother, and a man</b> with regard to <b>his wife, and sons of sisters,</b> i.e., nephews born to the sisters of the deceased, all <b>inherit</b> from their respective relatives <b>but do not bequeath</b> to them. <b>A woman</b> with regard to <b>her sons, and a woman</b> with regard to <b>her husband, and maternal uncles,</b> all <b>bequeath</b> to their respective relatives <b>but do not inherit</b> from them. <b>And maternal brothers,</b> despite being blood relatives, <b>do not inherit</b> from each other <b>nor</b> do they <b>bequeath</b> to one another, as they are not considered relatives for the purpose of inheritance.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara begins by clarifying the order of the list in the mishna. <b>What is different,</b> i.e., what is the reason, <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches: A father</b> with regard to his <b>sons,</b> as <b>the first</b> example? <b>Let</b> it <b>teach: Sons</b> with regard to their <b>father,</b> as <b>the first</b> example. The Gemara explains why this would be preferable: <b>One</b> reason is <b>that we do not</b> want to <b>begin with a calamity,</b> as the death of a son during his father’s lifetime is a calamity; therefore, it would have been appropriate to begin with the example of sons inheriting from their father.

Daf 108b

<b>And furthermore,</b> the verse first states that a son inherits from his father, <b>as it is written</b> in the portion concerning inheritance: <b>“If a man dies, and has no son,</b> then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8).
The Gemara answers: <b>And</b> as for the <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna who listed the father inheriting first, <b>since</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a father inherits from his son <b>is learned through a derivation</b> and is not explicitly mentioned in the verse, this <i>halakha</i> is <b>dear to him;</b> therefore, he listed it first.
<b>And what</b> is the <b>derivation? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> concerning the verse: “And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family, and he shall inherit it” (Numbers 27:11): <b>“His kinsman”; this</b> is referring to <b>the father,</b> and the Torah <b>teaches that the father precedes the brothers</b> of the deceased in inheriting from him. One <b>might</b> have thought that the father of the deceased <b>should precede the son</b> of the deceased in inheriting from him; <b>the verse</b> therefore <b>states: “Next [<i>hakkarov</i>]</b> to him,” teaching that the <b>closer [<i>karov</i>]</b> one is to the deceased, the <b>earlier</b> one is in the order of inheritance, and a son of the deceased is considered to be a closer relative to the deceased than the father of the deceased.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what did you see to include the son</b> as the closer relative than the father <b>and to exclude the brother?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>I include the son, as he stands in place of his father to designate</b> a Hebrew maidservant as a wife for himself, which a brother cannot do. <b>And</b> similarly, he stands in place of his father <b>with regard to an ancestral field.</b> If a son redeems a field consecrated by his father, it is considered as though the father himself redeemed it and the field returns to the family in the Jubilee Year. By contrast, if the brother of the one who consecrated it redeems the field, it does not return to the family (see Leviticus 27:16–21).
The Gemara asks: <b>On the contrary, I</b> should <b>include the brother</b> as the closer relative, <b>as he stands in his brother’s place with regard to levirate marriage,</b> and a son does not. The Gemara answers: This is not a valid claim, as <b>is there levirate marriage except in a case where there is no son? In a case where there is a son, there is no levirate marriage.</b> This indicates that a son stands in place of the deceased before a brother even with regard to levirate marriage.
The Gemara comments: <b>The reason</b> that a son is considered to be a closer relative than a brother <b>is</b> specifically <b>due to this refutation,</b> that where there is a son there is no levirate marriage. This indicates that <b>without this</b> refutation <b>I would say</b> that <b>a brother is superior</b> to a son in terms of how close a relative he is. The Gemara therefore asks: Why not <b>derive</b> that a son is closer to the deceased than a brother

Daf 109a

from the fact <b>that here,</b> there are <b>two</b> examples of the superiority of a son, designation and an ancestral field, <b>and here,</b> there is only <b>one</b> demonstration of the superiority of a brother, levirate marriage?
The Gemara answers: With regard to <b>an ancestral field itself, the <i>tanna</i> establishes his</b> ruling <b>from this</b> same <b>reason: Is there levirate marriage except in a case where there is no son? In a case where there is a son, there is no levirate marriage.</b> The determination that the redemption of the ancestral field by a son is in place of the redemption of the field by the father, whereas the redemption of the field by a brother is not, is based on the reasoning that the <i>halakha</i> of levirate marriage is not an indication that a brother is a closer relative than a son. Therefore, the <i>halakha</i> of an ancestral field cannot be regarded as a second example of the son’s superiority, as it stems from the first example, that of levirate marriage.
The Gemara suggests an alternative derivation: Why should the father of the deceased inherit before only the brothers? <b>Say</b> that he should inherit before the daughter of the deceased as well by interpreting the verse as follows: <b>“His kinsman”</b> (Numbers 27:11), <b>this</b> is referring to <b>the father,</b> and the Torah <b>teaches that the father precedes the daughter</b> of the deceased in inheriting from him. One <b>might</b> have thought that the father of the deceased <b>should precede the son</b> of the deceased in inheriting from him. <b>The verse</b> therefore <b>states: “Next [<i>hakkarov</i>]</b> to him,” teaching that the <b>closer [<i>karov</i>]</b> one is to the deceased, the <b>earlier</b> one is in the order of inheritance.
This suggestion is rejected: <b>Since with regard to the matter of levirate marriage a son and a daughter are equivalent,</b> as levirate marriage is not performed if the deceased had either a son or a daughter, it stands to reason that <b>with regard to the matter of inheritance as well, a son and a daughter are equivalent</b> in that the father does not precede the daughter.
The Gemara suggests an alternative derivation: Why should the father of the deceased inherit before the brothers of the deceased? <b>Say</b> that he should inherit only before his own brothers by interpreting the verse as follows: <b>“His kinsman”</b> ( Numbers 27:11), <b>this</b> is referring to <b>the father,</b> and the Torah <b>teaches that the father precedes the father’s brothers</b> in inheriting from the deceased. One <b>might</b> have thought that the father of the deceased <b>should precede the brothers</b> of the deceased in inheriting from him. <b>The verse states: “Next [<i>hakkarov</i>]</b> to him,” teaching that the <b>closer [<i>karov</i>]</b> one is to the deceased, the <b>earlier</b> one is in the order of inheritance.
The Gemara responds: <b>A verse is not necessary</b> to teach that the father of the deceased inherits before <b>the father’s brothers,</b> for the following reason: <b>By whose virtue do the father’s brothers come</b> to inherit from the deceased? <b>By virtue</b> of the <b>father,</b> as their right to inherit is a result of their being brothers of the father of the deceased. Could it be that while the <b>father is still alive, his brothers should inherit?</b> The Gemara therefore concludes that the father precedes the brothers of the deceased.
The Gemara challenges: <b>But the verses are not written that way, as it is written:</b> “And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers” (Numbers 27:10), and only later is it written: <b>“And if his father has no brothers,</b> then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him” (Numbers 27:11), indicating that the father, whose right to inherit is derived from the term “kinsman,” inherits only after the brothers of the deceased and his own brothers. The Gemara explains: The <b>verses are not written in order,</b> since as explained earlier, it is not reasonable that the father’s brothers inherit before the father. Therefore, it must be that the inheritance of the father is not written in its proper place, and he may inherit even before the brothers of the deceased.
§ The Gemara records an additional derivation for the <i>halakha</i> that the father precedes the brothers of the deceased. <b>And this <i>tanna</i> cites it from here, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yosei, taught this</b> <i>halakha</i>: It is written: <b>“If a man dies, and has no son,</b> then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8). In the rest of the passage the verse employs the phrase “and you shall give.” It is only in this verse that it employs the phrase “and you shall pass.” Based on this, Rabbi Yishmael teaches that <b>in a case</b> where there is <b>a daughter, you pass an inheritance</b> to her <b>from</b> one who appears to have precedence, namely, <b>the father, and</b> by inference, <b>you do not pass</b> the <b>inheritance from the father in a case</b> where there are <b>brothers</b> of the deceased.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b>in a case</b> where there is <b>a daughter, you pass</b> the <b>inheritance</b> to her <b>from the brothers,</b>

Daf 109b

<b>but you do not pass an inheritance from the father even in a case</b> where there is <b>a daughter,</b> so that the father precedes the daughter in the order of inheritance? The Gemara answers: <b>If so, the Merciful One would not write: “Then you shall pass</b> the inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8). This indicates that the logical order of inheritance is being overridden, as the fact that the daughter precedes the brothers of the deceased is due to her being a closer relative of his. It is obvious that the Torah intends that she precede even the father.
Having quoted two derivations for the <i>halakha</i> that the father precedes the brothers, the Gemara proceeds to discuss them and asks: <b>And according to the one who derives it from</b> the term: <b>“And you shall pass,” what does he do with this</b> term: <b>“His kinsman,”</b> which was said to refer to the father? The Gemara answers: <b>He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“His kinsman.” This</b> is referring to <b>his wife,</b> and the Torah <b>teaches that a husband inherits</b> from <b>his wife.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to the one who derives it from</b> the term: <b>“His kinsman,” what does he do with this</b> term: <b>“And you shall pass”? He requires it for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>, that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: In</b> the context of <b>all of</b> the relatives listed in the passage detailing the laws of inheritance, it <b>is stated concerning them</b> with the terminology of <b>giving, and</b> only <b>here,</b> in the context of daughters, it <b>is stated concerning them</b> with the terminology of <b>passing.</b> This teaches us <b>that you have no one who passes an inheritance</b> of land in Eretz Yisrael <b>from one tribe to another except for a daughter, since her son and husband inherit</b> from <b>her.</b>
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the interpretation of the term: “His kinsman” (Numbers 27:11). <b>And from where</b> does one know to derive <b>that</b> with regard to the term: <b>“His kinsman [<i>she’ero</i>],” this</b> is referring to <b>the father, as it is written</b> in the context of forbidden sexual relations: <b>“She is your father’s kinswoman [<i>she’er</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 18:12)? Perhaps one should <b>say</b> instead: <b>“His kinswoman,” this</b> is referring to <b>the mother, as it is</b> also <b>written: “For she is your mother’s kinswoman [<i>she’er</i>]”</b> (Leviticus 18:13).
<b>Rava said</b> in response that <b>the verse states:</b> “Then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him <b>of his family, and he shall inherit it”</b> (Numbers 27:11), emphasizing that “kinsman” is referring specifically to someone who is of his family, and it is <b>the father’s family</b> that <b>is called</b> one’s <b>family,</b> while one’s <b>mother’s family is not called</b> one’s <b>family.</b> Proof for this is found in another verse, <b>as it is written: “By their families, by their fathers’ houses”</b> (Numbers 1:2).
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>And</b> is one’s <b>mother’s family</b> indeed <b>not called</b> one’s <b>family? But it is written</b> in the episode of Micah forming an idol to be worshipped: <b>“And there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah of the family of Judah who was a Levite, and he sojourned there”</b> (Judges 17:7). The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>This matter itself</b> is <b>difficult. You said: “Who was a Levite,”</b> as <b>apparently he came from</b> the tribe of <b>Levi,</b> but the verse says: <b>“Of the family of Judah,”</b> so <b>apparently he came from</b> the tribe of <b>Judah. Rather, is it not that his father</b> was <b>from</b> the tribe of <b>Levi and his mother</b> was <b>from</b> the tribe of <b>Judah, and</b> yet the verse <b>says</b> that he was: <b>“Of the family of Judah”?</b> This appears to prove that one’s mother’s family is also called his family.
<b>Rava bar Rav Ḥanan said</b> in response: <b>No,</b> the verse speaks of <b>a man whose name</b> was <b>Levi,</b> but his father was of the tribe of Judah. The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> how <b>is that which Micah said</b> when that man agreed to serve as his priest: <b>“Now I know that the Lord will do me good, seeing that I have a Levite as my priest”</b> (Judges 17:13), understood? It is understood only if he was an actual Levite, not if he was from the tribe of Judah and named Levi. Rava bar Rav Ḥanan responded: <b>Yes,</b> it is understood. Micah understood the fact <b>that a man whose name</b> is <b>Levi happened upon him</b> as an auspicious sign.
The Gemara asks further: <b>But</b> is it <b>so</b> that <b>his name</b> was indeed <b>Levi; but wasn’t Jonathan his name, as it is stated: “And Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites”</b> (Judges 18:30)? Rava bar Rav Ḥanan <b>said to him: And according to your reasoning,</b> that his name was not Levi but he was from the tribe of Levi, there is also a difficulty from that same verse: <b>But</b> is it <b>so</b> that <b>he</b> was <b>the son of Manasseh; but wasn’t he the son of Moses, as it is written: “The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer”</b> (I Chronicles 23:15)?
Rava bar Rav Ḥanan explains the verse: <b>Rather,</b> although he was the son of Moses, <b>because he acted</b> as <b>Manasseh</b> the king of Judah, who was notorious for idol worship, <b>acted, the verse linked him to Manasseh</b> by calling him “the son of Manasseh.” <b>Here too,</b> in the verse from which you seek to prove that one’s mother’s family is called one’s family, <b>since he acted</b> as <b>Manasseh, who came from</b> the tribe of <b>Judah, acted, the verse linked him to Judah</b> by stating that he was “of the family of Judah,” but he was, in fact, a Levite.
In connection with this, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai: From here</b> it is learned <b>that corruption is linked to one who is corrupt,</b> as this man was linked to Manasseh and Judah despite having no familial connection to them. <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina says:</b> That concept can be seen <b>from here,</b> in the matter of Adonijah, the son of David: <b>“And he was also a very handsome man; and she gave birth to him after Absalom,”</b> (I Kings 1:6) <b>but Adonijah wasn’t the son of Haggith and Absalom was the son of Maachah,</b> so why does the verse state: “And she gave birth to him after Absalom,” as if they were sons of the same mother? <b>Rather, since Adonijah acted</b> in a manner fit for <b>Absalom, who</b> also <b>rebelled against the monarchy, the verse linked him to Absalom,</b> referring to him as his full brother. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to Jonathan, <b>since he acted</b> as <b>Manasseh acted, the verse linked him to Manasseh.</b>
§ In connection with the story of Jonathan, son of Manasseh, the Gemara cites a related statement. <b>Rabbi Elazar says: A person should always cleave to good</b> people, meaning one should marry a woman from a good family, as this is beneficial for the offspring of that marriage. <b>As</b> in the case of <b>Moses, who married a daughter of Yitro,</b> who was a priest of idolatry, <b>Jonathan,</b> who was also a priest of idolatry, <b>descended from him,</b> while in the case of <b>Aaron, who married the daughter of Amminadab,</b> who was of distinguished lineage in the tribe of Judah, <b>Pinehas descended from him.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Pinehas not</b> also <b>come from Yitro? But it is written: “And Elazar, Aaron’s son, took one of the daughters of Putiel as a wife;</b> and she bore him Pinehas” (Exodus 6:25). <b>What, is it not</b> stating <b>that</b> Pinehas <b>came from</b> the family of <b>Yitro, who</b> was also called Putiel because he <b>fattened [<i>pittem</i>] calves for idol worship?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is stating <b>that he came from Joseph, who battled [<i>shepitpet</i>] with his desire</b> by resisting the advances of Potiphar’s wife.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t</b> the <b>tribes denigrated him</b> after he killed Zimri (see Numbers, chapter 25), <b>and would say</b> of him: <b>Have you seen this son of Puti, the son</b> of he <b>whose mother’s father fattened calves for idol worship? Should</b> such a man <b>kill a prince of a tribe of Israel?</b>

Daf 110a

<b>Rather,</b> this is how the matter should be resolved: <b>If his mother’s father</b> came <b>from</b> the family of <b>Joseph, his mother’s mother</b> came <b>from</b> the family of <b>Yitro,</b> and <b>if his mother’s father</b> came <b>from</b> the family of <b>Yitro, his mother’s mother</b> came <b>from</b> the family of <b>Joseph,</b> so while his mother was descended from Joseph on one side and from Yitro on the other, Pinehas was a more distant relative to Yitro than Jonathan was. Based on this conclusion, the language of the verse <b>is also precise, as it is written:</b> “And Elazar, Aaron’s son, took <b>one of the daughters of Putiel”</b> (Exodus 6:25). <b>Conclude from</b> the wording of the verse that Pinehas was descended from <b>two</b> men who were referred to as Puti: Yitro and Joseph.
<b>Rava says: One who marries a woman needs to</b> first <b>examine her brothers</b> so that he will know in advance what character his children will have, <b>as it is stated: “And Aaron took Elisheva, the daughter of Amminadav, the sister of Nahshon”</b> (Exodus 6:23). <b>By inference from that which is stated: “The daughter of Amminadav,” do I not know that she is the sister of Nahshon,</b> as Nahshon was the son of Amminadav? <b>What</b> is the meaning when <b>the verse states: “The sister of Nahshon”? From here</b> one learns <b>that one who marries a woman needs to examine her brothers.</b> The reason is as the Sages <b>taught: Most sons resemble the mother’s brothers.</b>
In connection with the Gemara’s mention of Jonathan, who served as a priest for Micah, the Gemara quotes additional statements of the Sages concerning that episode. Describing when the men from the tribe of Dan passed through Micah’s house, the verse states: <b>“And they turned aside there and said to him: Who brought you here [<i>halom</i>], and what [<i>ma</i>] are you doing in this place, and what do you have here [<i>po</i>]?”</b> (Judges 18:3). The Sages interpret their multiple questions. <b>They said to him: Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “Do not draw close to here [<i>halom</i>]”</b> (Exodus 3:5)? <b>Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “What [<i>ma</i>] is that in your hand”</b> (Exodus 4:2)? <b>Do you not come from Moses, about whom it is written: “But as for you, stand here [<i>po</i>] with me”</b> (Deuteronomy 5:27)? <b>Shall you,</b> a descendant of our teacher Moses, <b>become a priest for idol worship?</b>
Jonathan <b>said to them: This</b> is the tradition that <b>I received from the house of my father’s father: A person should always hire himself</b> out <b>to idol worship and not require</b> the help <b>of people</b> by receiving charity, and I took this position in order to avoid having to take charity.
The Gemara comments: <b>And he,</b> Jonathan, <b>thought</b> that this referred <b>to actual idol worship, but</b> that <b>is not so,</b> that was not the intent of the tradition. <b>Rather,</b> here the term <b>idol worship,</b> literally: Strange service, is referring to <b>service,</b> i.e., labor, <b>that</b> is <b>strange,</b> i.e., unsuitable, <b>for him.</b> In other words, one should be willing to perform labor that is difficult and humiliating in his eyes rather than become a recipient of charity. <b>As Rav said to Rav Kahana,</b> his student: <b>Skin a carcass in the market and take payment, but do not say: I am a great man and this matter is beneath me.</b>
The Gemara continues its discussion of that episode. Later, <b>when</b> King <b>David saw that money was excessively precious to</b> Jonathan, <b>he appointed him</b> as director <b>of the treasuries</b> of the Temple, <b>as it is stated: “And Shebuel, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler over the treasuries”</b> (I Chronicles 26:24). The Gemara asks: <b>And was his name</b> really <b>Shebuel; but wasn’t his name Jonathan? Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> He is called Shebuel in order to allude to the fact <b>that</b> he repented and <b>returned to God [<i>shav la’el</i> ] with all his heart.</b>
§ The mishna teaches in the list of those who inherit from and bequeath to each other: <b>Sons</b> with regard to <b>their father.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i> that sons inherit the entire estate and daughters do not receive a share along with them? <b>As it is written: “If a man dies,</b> and has no son, then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8). <b>The reason</b> the inheritance would be passed to a daughter is <b>that he has no son, but</b> if <b>he has a son,</b> the <b>son takes precedence. Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> Why not <b>say</b> the following: <b>If there is</b> only <b>a son, let</b> the <b>son inherit</b> the father’s estate; if <b>there is</b> only <b>a daughter, let</b> the <b>daughter inherit</b> the father’s estate; and if <b>there is</b> both <b>a son and a daughter, neither this one should inherit nor that one should inherit.</b>
Abaye asked Rav Pappa: <b>And rather,</b>

Daf 110b

<b>who</b> then <b>should inherit? Is that to say that the ruler of the city should inherit?</b> Rav Pappa said to him: <b>This is what I</b> meant to <b>say:</b> If <b>there is a son and a daughter, this</b> one <b>should not inherit all of</b> the estate, <b>and that</b> one <b>should not inherit all of</b> the estate, <b>but they should inherit it</b> in <b>equal</b> portions <b>to one another.</b>
<b>Abaye said to him: But is the verse necessary</b> in order <b>to teach us that when he has only one child,</b> that child <b>should inherit all of his property?</b> If you say that the right of the son and daughter to the inheritance is equal, then the verse: “If a man dies, and has no son” (Numbers 27:8), which teaches that when there is no son his daughter inherits, is superfluous. Rav Pappa responded: <b>And perhaps this</b> verse <b>teaches us this: That a daughter is also subject to</b> receiving <b>inheritance.</b> The Gemara replies: No, the verse does not need to teach us this, since <b>that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is derived from</b> the verse: <b>“And every daughter who possesses an inheritance”</b> (Numbers 36:8), which clearly states that a daughter is subject to receiving inheritance.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that a son inherits his father’s estate and precedes a daughter is derived <b>from here,</b> in the passage in the Torah where the daughters of Zelophehad request their father’s inheritance in Eretz Yisrael. They said to Moses: <b>“Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he has no son?”</b> (Numbers 27:4). Rabbi Aḥa ben Ya’akov infers: <b>The reason</b> they requested the inheritance is <b>that,</b> as they said: He <b>has no son.</b> One can infer: <b>But</b> if <b>he has a son,</b> the <b>son takes precedence</b> and the daughters would not have requested an inheritance.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But perhaps</b> it was <b>the daughters of Zelophehad who said this,</b> i.e., that they were entitled to an inheritance only because their father had no son. They thought that this was the <i>halakha</i> based on the custom at that time, but after God spoke to Moses, the <b>Torah was given and a <i>halakha</i> was initiated</b> that a daughter’s right to inherit is equal to that of the son. The Gemara accepts this difficulty and states: <b>Rather, it is clear</b> that the source for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>as we answered initially,</b> i.e., as Abaya derived from the verse of: “If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8).
<b>Ravina said:</b> The source for the <i>halakha</i> that a son precedes a daughter is <b>from here: “Who is next to him [<i>hakkarov elav</i>]”</b> (Numbers 27:11), teaching that the <b>closer [<i>karov</i>]</b> one is to the deceased, the <b>earlier</b> one is in the order of inheritance, and a son of the deceased is considered to be a closer relative to the deceased than the daughter.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what</b> demonstrates the <b>closeness of a son more than</b> that of <b>a daughter? That a son stands in place of his father to designate</b> a Hebrew maidservant as a wife for himself <b>and with regard to an ancestral field.</b> The Gemara rejects this: This is not a valid proof, as <b>designation</b> cannot demonstrate that a son is a closer relative; <b>a daughter is not subject to designation,</b> because she obviously cannot marry the Hebrew maidservant. With regard to <b>an ancestral field as well, the <i>tanna</i> establishes his</b> ruling that a son is a closer relative than others <b>from this</b> same <b>refutation: Is there levirate marriage except in a case where there is no son?</b> And this applies also where there is no daughter. <b>Rather, it is clear</b> that the source for this <i>halakha</i> is <b>as we answered initially.</b>
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that the <i>halakha</i> that a son precedes a daughter is derived <b>from here,</b> in the passage in the Torah addressing the inheritance of slaves, which states: <b>“And you may make them an inheritance for your sons [<i>livneikhem</i>] after you”</b> (Leviticus 25:46). One can infer: <b>“Your sons,” but not your daughters.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> then when the verse states: <b>“That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your sons [<i>beneikhem</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 11:21), should one infer that <b>this too</b> means: <b>“Your sons,” but not your daughters?</b> Is it not obvious that daughters are also worthy of receiving the blessing of longevity?
The Gemara answers: <b>A blessing is different.</b> In a verse that speaks of blessings, the term <i>beneikhem</i> should be understood in its broader sense, as “your children.” In a verse that speaks of a <i>halakha</i>, it is to be understood in the narrower sense of “your sons.”
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And paternal brothers inherit</b> from one another <b>and bequeath</b> to each other. <b>From where do we</b> derive this <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabba said:</b> It <b>is derived from</b> a verbal analogy between the word: <b>Brothers,</b> stated with regard to inheritance, and the word: <b>Brothers,</b> found in the verses concerning <b>Jacob’s sons.</b> When Jacob’s sons speak to Joseph, they state: “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 42:13), and in the passage discussing inheritance the verse states: “And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers” (Numbers 27:10). <b>Just as there,</b> in the verse concerning Jacob’s sons, the word brothers is referring to <b>paternal</b> brothers <b>and not maternal</b> brothers, as the twelve of them shared only the same father, <b>so too here,</b> where this term is used with regard to inheritance, the verse is referring to <b>paternal</b> brothers <b>and not maternal</b> brothers.
The Gemara asks: <b>But why do I</b> need this proof from the verse concerning Jacob’s sons? <b>It is written</b> in the passage concerning inheritance: “Then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him <b>of his family, and he shall inherit it”</b> (Numbers 27:11). When the term “family” is used in the Bible, one’s <b>father’s family is called</b> one’s <b>family,</b> while one’s <b>mother’s family is not called</b> one’s <b>family,</b> so that in all matters of inheritance, it is the patrilineal relatives who are taken into account.
The Gemara answers: <b>Yes, it is indeed so</b> that the verbal analogy is not needed to teach the <i>halakha</i> of inheritance, <b>and when Rabba’s</b> explanation <b>was stated,</b> it <b>was stated with regard to the matter of levirate marriage,</b> teaching that levirate marriage is performed only by a paternal brother but not by a maternal brother.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And a man</b> with regard to <b>his mother</b> inherits from her relatives but does not bequeath to her. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: <b>As the Sages taught:</b>

Daf 111a

The verse states: <b>“And every daughter who possesses an inheritance from the tribes of the children of Israel”</b> (Numbers 36:8). Noting the plural in the phrase “from the tribes of the children of Israel,” the <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>How</b> can <b>a daughter inherit</b> land from <b>two tribes? Rather, this</b> is referring to a daughter <b>whose father</b> is <b>from one tribe but her mother</b> is <b>from another tribe, and they</b> both <b>died, and she inherited</b> from both of <b>them.</b> Therefore, it can be seen in this verse that a daughter inherits from her mother.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a daughter</b> inherits from her mother; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>a son</b> inherits from his mother as well? <b>You</b> can <b>say an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference: <b>And just as a daughter, whose power is diminished with regard to</b> her <b>father’s property</b> in that she does not inherit it when there is a son, yet her power <b>is enhanced with regard to</b> her <b>mother’s property</b> in that she inherits it; with regard to <b>a son, whose power is enhanced with regard to</b> his <b>father’s property</b> in that he is first in the order of inheritance, <b>is it not logical that his power is enhanced with regard to</b> his <b>mother’s property?</b> The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And from the place that you came,</b> i.e., from the inference that was just stated, one can say the following: <b>Just as there,</b> with regard to a father’s property, <b>a son precedes a daughter, so too here,</b> with regard to a mother’s property, <b>a son precedes a daughter.</b> This is the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, and Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Yosei, said in the name of Rabbi Zekharya ben Hakatzav: Both the son and the daughter are equal with regard to the mother’s property. What is the reason</b> for his ruling? <b>It is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source.</b> According to this principle, a <i>halakha</i> derived by means of an <i>a fortiori</i> inference cannot go beyond the <i>halakhot</i> of the source from which it is derived. Since the <i>halakha</i> that a son inherits from his mother was derived via an <i>a fortiori</i> inference from the <i>halakha</i> that a daughter inherits from her mother, it cannot be that this inference should lead to the conclusion that a son precedes a daughter in inheriting from their mother.
The Gemara asks: <b>And doesn’t the first <i>tanna</i></b> also <b>interpret</b> verses employing the principle of: <b>It is sufficient</b> for the conclusion that emerges from an <i>a fortiori</i> inference to be like its source? <b>But</b> the principle of: <b>It is sufficient,</b> which limits the extent of <i>a fortiori</i> inference, <b>is</b> found <b>in the Torah,</b> so how could he disagree with it?
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that explains the hermeneutical principles: <b>How</b> does <b>an <i>a fortiori</i> inference</b> work? The verse states with regard to Miriam, after she spoke ill of her brother Moses: <b>“And the Lord said to Moses: If her father had but spit in her face, should she not hide in shame seven days?”</b> (Numbers 12:14). The verse is saying that if a father spits in the face of his daughter and reprimands her, she would feel shame for seven days. By <b>an <i>a fortiori</i></b> inference it is derived that Miriam, who suffered the more severe reprimand <b>of the Divine Presence,</b> should be ostracized for <b>fourteen</b> days. Why then, was Miriam ostracized for only seven days?
<b>Rather, it is sufficient for the</b> conclusion that <b>emerges from</b> an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference to be like</b> its <b>source,</b> so her punishment cannot be for longer than the punishment of one who is reprimanded by a father. In any event, the principle the begins with: It is sufficient, can be seen in this verse, so how does the first <i>tanna</i> rule that a son precedes a daughter with regard to a mother’s property?
The Gemara answers: <b>Generally,</b> the first <i>tanna</i> also <b>interprets</b> verses employing the principle that begins with: <b>It is sufficient, but it is different here</b> with regard to inheritance, <b>as the verse states:</b> “And every daughter who possesses an inheritance <b>from the tribes</b> of the children of Israel” (Numbers 36:8). The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the <b>tribe of the mother to</b> the <b>tribe of the father.</b> Therefore, the first <i>tanna</i> holds that <b>just as</b> with regard to the <b>tribe of the father,</b> i.e., inheriting from one’s father, <b>a son precedes a daughter, so too,</b> with regard to the <b>tribe of the mother,</b> i.e., inheriting from one’s mother, <b>a son precedes a daughter.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Nittai thought to perform an action,</b> i.e., issue a ruling, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav,</b> who taught that a son and daughter are equal with regard to inheriting from their mother. <b>Shmuel said to him: In accordance with whose</b> opinion do you wish to issue this ruling, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Zekharya? Zekharya is nil [<i>afes</i>],</b> i.e., his statement was not accepted as <i>halakha</i>. <b>Rabbi Tavla performed an action,</b> i.e., issued a ruling, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav. Rav Naḥman said to him: What is this?</b> Rabbi Tavla <b>said to him: As Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelamya says in the name of Rav:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Go retract your</b> ruling, <b>and if</b> you do <b>not, I will take Rav Ḥinnana bar Shelamya out of your ear,</b> i.e., I will punish you severely for ruling against the accepted <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara relates further: <b>Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya thought to perform an action,</b> i.e., issue a ruling, <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav. Rav Naḥman said to him: What is this?</b> Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya <b>said to him: As Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Shall I send</b> a messenger <b>to</b> Rav Huna to ask him if that is indeed what he said? Rav Huna bar Ḥiyya <b>was embarrassed,</b> as he was not certain that Rav Huna actually said this ruling. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Now, if Rav Huna were</b> to have <b>died, you would have been brazen</b> enough to say <b>before me</b> that this is what he said, but since he is still alive, you cannot be so brazen.
The Gemara asks: <b>And he,</b> Rav Naḥman, <b>in accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>does he hold?</b> As there were various sages who ruled in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav, why did Rav Naḥman not agree? The Gemara answers: He holds <b>in accordance with this</b> statement <b>of Rav and Shmuel, who both say:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rabbi Yannai,</b> who had already grown old and whose eyes were dim, <b>would walk leaning on the shoulder of Rabbi Simlai, his attendant, and Rabbi Yehuda Nesia came toward them.</b> Rabbi Simlai <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yannai: The <b>person who is coming toward us is handsome and his cloak</b> is <b>handsome. When</b> Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>reached him,</b> Rabbi Yannai <b>felt</b> his cloak and <b>said to</b> Rabbi Simlai: Concerning <b>this</b> cloak, <b>its measurement</b> with regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity <b>is like the</b> measurement of <b>sackcloth,</b> meaning it was a cloak of inferior quality, as it was thick and rough.
When Rabbi Yehuda Nesia met Rabbi Yannai he <b>asked him: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a son precedes a daughter with regard to the mother’s property?</b> Rabbi Yannai <b>said to him: As it is written:</b> “And every daughter who possesses an inheritance from <b>the tribes</b> of the children of Israel” (Numbers 36:8). The verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the <b>tribe of the mother to</b> the <b>tribe of the father.</b> This teaches that <b>just as</b> with regard to the <b>tribe of the father a son precedes a daughter, so too,</b> with regard to the <b>tribe of the mother, a son precedes a daughter.</b> Rabbi Yehuda Nesia <b>said to him: If</b> so, if these two <i>halakhot</i> are in fact juxtaposed, the following should also be derived: <b>Just as</b> with regard to the inheritance of <b>the father’s tribe a firstborn takes a double</b> portion, <b>so too,</b> with regard to inheritance from <b>the mother’s tribe,</b> when he inherits from his mother <b>a firstborn takes a double</b> portion.

Daf 111b

<b>He said to his attendant: Take</b> me away from here, as <b>this</b> man, Rabbi Yehuda Nesia, <b>does not desire to learn</b> but is instead raising difficulties that are easily resolved. <b>And what is the reason</b> he does not receive a double portion? <b>Abaye said: The verse</b> concerning the double portion received by a firstborn son <b>states:</b> “By giving him a double portion <b>of all that he has”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), indicating that he receives a double portion in all that <b>he</b> has, <b>but not</b> in all that <b>she</b> has.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why not <b>say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies in the case of <b>a bachelor who married a widow,</b> i.e., a man who marries a woman who already has children from another man, so that the firstborn son is his firstborn but not hers, <b>but</b> in the case of <b>a bachelor who married a virgin, so too</b> the <i>halakha</i> will be <b>that</b> their firstborn son <b>will take</b> a double portion of his mother’s inheritance?
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> There is a different derivation teaching that <i>halakha</i>, as the same <b>verse states:</b> “For he is <b>the first fruits of his strength [<i>ono</i>]”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), indicating that the <i>halakha</i> of the double portion is stated with regard to <b>his strength, but not her strength,</b> thereby excluding a son who is the firstborn of his mother alone.
The Gemara challenges: But <b>that</b> verse <b>is required to</b> derive the <i>halakha</i> of a child who <b>came</b> into the world <b>after</b> his mother gave birth to <b>non-viable newborns</b> who did not reach the full term of nine months. This verse teaches <b>that</b> such a firstborn son <b>should be a firstborn with regard to inheritance,</b> even though he is not a firstborn with regard to the mitzva to redeem one’s firstborn son. How is this <i>halakha</i> derived from the verse? The term “his strength [<i>ono</i>]” is understood as referring to acute mourning [<i>aninut</i>], in the following manner: A firstborn son for the purpose of inheritance of land is only <b>one whose</b> father’s <b>heart is pained about him</b> when he dies, i.e., a son who lives beyond birth, <b>excluding this</b> non-viable newborn <b>whose</b> father’s <b>heart is not pained about him</b> when he dies. Therefore, the next viable son to be born after a non-viable newborn is considered the firstborn.
The Gemara answers: <b>If so,</b> that the sole purpose of the term: “His strength” is to teach that <i>halakha</i>, <b>let the verse say: For he is the first fruit of strength [<i>on</i>],</b> omitting the possessive “his,” represented by the letter <i>vav</i>. <b>What</b> is derived from the more expanded term: <b>“His strength [<i>ono</i>],”</b> which indicates specifically the father’s strength? <b>Conclude two</b> conclusions <b>from it,</b> both with regard to mourning and with regard to the status of the firstborn as the father’s heir specifically.
The Gemara raises a difficulty: <b>But</b> one can <b>still say</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies in a case of <b>a widower who married a virgin,</b> so that he already has a firstborn from his previous marriage who is the first fruit of his strength. And the son born to him and his second wife is not the first fruit of his strength, and it is this type of firstborn who does not inherit a double portion of his mother’s estate. <b>But</b> in a case of <b>a bachelor who married a virgin, so too</b> the <i>halakha</i> will be <b>that</b> their shared firstborn son <b>will take</b> a double portion of his mother’s inheritance.
<b>Rather, Rava said:</b> There is a different derivation teaching that <i>halakha</i>, as the same <b>verse states: “The right of the firstborn is his”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17). The emphasis on “his” indicates that <b>the primogeniture</b> applies specifically <b>to a man, and the primogeniture does not</b> apply <b>to a woman,</b> whether the woman is the one inheriting or is the legator.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And a man</b> with regard to <b>his wife</b> inherits but does not bequeath. The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara explains: <b>As the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse concerning inheritance states: “And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to <b>his kinsman [<i>she’ero</i>]</b> who is next to him of his family, and he shall inherit it” (Numbers 27:11). <b>This</b> kinsman is <b>one’s wife,</b> and the Torah <b>teaches that a husband inherits</b> from <b>his wife,</b> as the Gemara will explain later. One <b>might</b> have thought that <b>she would also inherit</b> from <b>him;</b> therefore, <b>the verse states: “And he shall inherit it,”</b> with the word “it” written in the feminine “<i>otah</i>,” which can also be translated as: Her. This teaches that it is <b>he who inherits</b> from <b>her, but she does not inherit</b> from <b>him.</b>
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But the verses are not written like this.</b> The verse states that “his kinsman” inherits from the deceased, so that if that term is referring to one’s wife, a wife should inherit from her husband. <b>Abaye said: Answer like this,</b> i.e., as if the verse were split into two parts. The first part is: <b>Then you shall give his inheritance to he who is next to him,</b> which is a general statement with regard to the inheritance of relatives. The second is: <b>His kinsman, and he shall inherit it,</b> meaning that a husband inherits from his kinsman, referring to his wife.
<b>Rava said:</b> Does <b>a sharp knife cut verses?</b> How can you split the verse, rearrange it and omit letters from its words? Abaye’s derivation rearranges the words and omits the letter <i>lamed</i> from the term “to his kinsman [<i>leshe’ero</i>].” <b>Rather, Rava said: This</b> is what the verse <b>is saying: And you shall give the inheritance of his kinsman [<i>she’ero</i>] to him.</b> The letters should be arranged differently, removing the letter <i>lamed</i> from the word <i>leshe’ero</i> and the letter <i>vav</i> from the word <i>naḥalato</i> and combining them to form the word <i>lo</i>, meaning: To him. Accordingly, the verse teaches that a husband inherits from his wife. The Gemara explains that Rava <b>holds that</b> the Sages <b>subtract and add and interpret homiletically,</b> meaning that letters can be removed from words and appended to each other, and a <i>halakha</i> can be derived from the new word formed by the combination of letters.
The Gemara comments: <b>And this <i>tanna</i> cites</b> the <i>halakha</i> that a husband inherits from his wife <b>from here, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>“And he shall inherit it,”</b> with the word “it” written in the feminine “<i>otah</i>,” which can also be translated as: Her. This <b>teaches that a husband inherits</b> from <b>his wife;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva,</b> similar to the derivation cited in the <i>baraita</i> above.
The <i>baraita</i> quotes another <i>tanna</i>. <b>Rabbi Yishmael says:</b> This derivation <b>is not necessary, as</b> the verse <b>states: “And every daughter who possesses an inheritance from the tribes of the children of Israel</b> shall be wife <b>to one of the family</b> of the tribe of her father” (Numbers 36:8). The purpose of this mitzva was so that the land she inherited from her father’s tribe will not be transferred to another tribe upon her death. <b>The verse speaks of a transfer</b> of inheritance from one tribe to another <b>by means of the husband,</b> i.e., she must not marry a man from another tribe so that the land will not be transferred to that tribe when her husband inherits from her upon her death. This indicates that a husband inherits from his wife.
Rabbi Yishmael continues: <b>And</b> another verse <b>states: “So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel transfer from tribe to tribe”</b> (Numbers 36:7), <b>and</b> another verse <b>states: “So shall no inheritance transfer from one tribe to another tribe”</b> (Numbers 36:9), also indicating that a husband inherits from his wife.
Rabbi Yishmael continues: <b>And</b> the verse in the Prophets <b>states: “And Elazar, the son of Aaron, died; and they buried him in the Hill of Pinehas his son,</b> which was given him in Mount Ephraim” (Joshua 24:33). <b>And from where</b> did <b>Pinehas have</b> land <b>that</b> his father, <b>Elazar, did not have? Rather,</b> this <b>teaches that Pinehas married a woman</b> who inherited her father’s land, <b>and she died and he inherited</b> from <b>her</b> so that he had his own land. This also indicates that a husband inherits from his wife.
Rabbi Yishmael continues. <b>And</b> the verse in the Writings <b>states: “And Seguv begot Yair, who had twenty-three cities in the land of Gilead”</b> (I Chronicles 2:22).

Daf 112a

<b>And from where</b> did <b>Yair have</b> land <b>that</b> his father, <b>Seguv, did not have?</b> Rather, this <b>teaches that Yair married a woman</b> who inherited her father’s land, <b>and she died and he inherited</b> from <b>her</b> so that he had his own land. This also indicates that a husband inherits from his wife.
The Gemara proceeds to explain this <i>baraita</i>. <b>What</b> is the meaning of: <b>And it states?</b> Why is it necessary to provide additional proofs beyond the first verse? The Gemara explains: The first verse seems to prove the <i>halakha</i> that a husband inherits from his wife. <b>And if you would say</b> that the <b>verse</b> that rules that a woman who inherited land from her father cannot marry a man from another tribe is not concerned that he will inherit from her, but rather the verse <b>is concerned about a transfer</b> of inheritance from one tribe to another by means of <b>the son</b> who will inherit from his mother, as he belongs to his father’s tribe, <b>but a husband does not inherit</b> from his wife; therefore, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> another verse that is seemingly superfluous: <b>“So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel transfer from tribe to tribe”</b> (Numbers 36:7). This teaches that a transfer of land could occur by means of the husband inheriting from her.
<b>And if you would say</b> that this verse is also concerned with the transfer of the inheritance by means of the son, and that the seemingly superfluous verse is stated for another purpose, i.e., in order to establish that a woman who inherited land from her father and marries a man from another tribe <b>will violate for that</b> act <b>a prohibition,</b> namely: “So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel transfer,” <b>and a positive mitzva,</b> namely: “Shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father”; therefore, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> another verse that is seemingly superfluous: <b>“So shall no inheritance transfer from one tribe to another tribe”</b> (Numbers 36:9), which teaches that a transfer can occur by means of the husband inheriting from his wife.
<b>And if you would say</b> that this verse is also concerned with the transfer of the inheritance by means of the son, and that the seemingly superfluous verse is stated for another purpose, i.e., in order to establish that a woman who inherited land from her father and marries a man from another tribe <b>violates for that</b> act <b>two prohibitions and a positive mitzva;</b> therefore, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> another proof that a husband inherits from his wife, from the verse: <b>“And Elazar, the son of Aaron, died”</b> (Joshua 24:33).
<b>And if you would say</b> that Pinehas did not inherit this land from his wife, but from his mother, as <b>it was Elazar,</b> his father, <b>who married a woman</b> who inherited land, <b>and she</b> subsequently <b>died, and</b> her son <b>Pinehas inherited</b> from <b>her</b> so that this verse proves the inheritance of a son and not that of a husband; therefore, <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the verse: <b>“And Seguv begot Yair”</b> (I Chronicles 2:22).
<b>And if you would say: That is</b> the case <b>there as well,</b> that it was Yair who inherited it from his deceased mother, <b>if so, why do I</b> need <b>two verses</b> to teach the same <i>halakha</i>? This concludes the Gemara’s explanation of the <i>baraita</i>.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: From where</b> do you know that this is how the verse should be understood? <b>Perhaps I</b> could <b>actually say to you: A husband does not inherit</b> from his wife, <b>and the verses are</b> concerned <b>about a transfer</b> of inheritance from one tribe to another by means of <b>the son, as we explained,</b> teaching that one who does so violates two prohibitions and a positive mitzva. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Yair,</b> one could say <b>that he purchased</b> it from a third party and did not inherit it. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Pinehas as well,</b> one could say <b>that he purchased</b> it from a third party.
Abaye <b>said to him: You cannot say that Pinehas purchased</b> the land where he buried his father, <b>as if so,</b> the <b>field would return</b> to its original owner <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year (see Leviticus, chapter 25), <b>and it would be found</b> that this <b>righteous man,</b> i.e., Elazar, <b>is buried in a grave</b> in land <b>that is not his.</b>
Rav Pappa asked further: <b>Rather, say that</b> in his capacity as a priest <b>he came into</b> possession of this land <b>as a dedicated field.</b> Pinehas, as a priest, may have owned the land by that means. Therefore, one can still say that a husband does not inherit from his wife, and the verses are concerned about a transfer of inheritance from one tribe to another by means of the son.
<b>Abaye said:</b> Even if you say that her son and not her husband inherits from her, <b>ultimately</b> the <b>inheritance is uprooted from the tribe of the mother and is moved to the tribe of the father,</b> and the prohibition against her marrying a man from another tribe is not effective in achieving its goal. The verse speaks of a woman who inherited the land from her mother who is of a different tribe from her father (see 111a). Even if she marries a man from her own tribe, the inheritance will be transferred from her mother’s tribe to that of her, the woman’s, husband, as even if the woman’s son inherits, he is of his father’s tribe.
Rav Pappa rejects this: <b>And from where</b> do you raise your challenge? <b>But perhaps</b> it <b>is different there, as</b> the inheritance <b>had already been transferred</b> by the mother of the woman when she married the father, so that the Torah is no longer concerned with the continued transfer. When the parents of this now-deceased woman married, the land that her mother would eventually inherit was already thought of as being transferred away from the ownership of her mother’s tribe. Therefore, the fact that even if this woman’s son inherits from her, the fact that the land will permanently belong to a member of her husband’s tribe is of no concern. Abaye <b>said to him: We do not say,</b> i.e., employ, the logic of: <b>As it had already been transferred,</b> since as long as this woman owned it, it still belonged to a person of the first tribe.
<b>Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi:</b> Even according to Abaye, who holds the verses teach that the husband inherits, there is still a difficulty. <b>Granted, if you say</b> the logic of: <b>As it has already been transferred, this is</b> how it can be understood <b>that the verse is established</b> as referring to both scenarios: The verse can be understood <b>either with regard to a transfer</b> by means of <b>the son</b> or <b>with regard to a transfer</b> by means of <b>the husband.</b> In both of these scenarios, the daughter’s marriage to a man from her father’s tribe is effective in ensuring that land she will inherit will not leave the tribe, because if she inherited it from her father it remains within the same tribe, and if she inherited it from her mother it had already been transferred when her mother married her father.
<b>But if you say</b> that <b>we do not say</b> the logic of: <b>As it has already been transferred,</b> then even <b>when she gets married to one of the family of the tribe of her father, what of it? But an inheritance is uprooted from the tribe of</b> her <b>mother,</b> who had inherited land from her, the mother’s, father, <b>to the tribe of</b> her <b>father,</b> as her husband is from her father’s tribe.
Rav Ashi said to him: There is a way that the transfer to another tribe can be avoided: <b>Where we marry her to a man whose father</b> is <b>from her father’s tribe and his mother is from her mother’s tribe,</b> the transfer is avoided as the land retains the exact status as it had when it was in the woman’s possession.

Daf 112b

The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> if a daughter who inherits land from both of her parents must marry a man whose father is from her father’s tribe and whose mother is from her mother’s tribe, <b>this</b> verse: “Shall be a wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father” (Numbers 36:8), <b>should have</b> said: Shall be a wife <b>to one of the family of the tribe of her father and her mother.</b> The Gemara replies: <b>If</b> it <b>were written like this, I would say</b> that <b>even the opposite</b> is permitted, that she may marry a man whose mother is from her father’s tribe and whose father is from her mother’s tribe. As long as she marries someone who is connected to both tribes, it is permitted. The verse therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the opposite is not permitted.
The Gemara comments: Concerning the marriage of a woman who inherited land, it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> the <b>transfer</b> of the inheritance <b>by means of the son, and</b> it <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>with regard to</b> the <b>transfer</b> of the inheritance <b>by means of the husband.</b> The Gemara presents the <i>baraitot</i>: A <i>baraita</i> <b>is taught with regard to</b> the <b>transfer</b> of the inheritance <b>by means of the son,</b> as follows: <b>“So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel transfer from tribe to tribe”</b> (Numbers 36:7); that <b>verse speaks of</b> the <b>transfer</b> of the inheritance <b>by means of the son.</b> The Torah prohibits the woman from marrying a man from a different tribe since her son will inherit from her and thereby the inheritance will transfer away from its original tribe.
<b>Do you say</b> that this is <b>with regard to</b> the <b>transfer</b> of the inheritance <b>by means of the son, or is it only with regard to</b> the <b>transfer</b> of the inheritance <b>by means of the husband? When it says: “So shall no inheritance transfer from one tribe to another tribe”</b> (Numbers 36:9), the verse is <b>speaking with regard to</b> the <b>transfer</b> of the inheritance <b>by means of the husband. How do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel transfer from tribe to tribe”</b> (Numbers 36:7)? That <b>verse speaks of</b> the <b>transfer</b> of the inheritance <b>by means of the son.</b>

Daf 113a

It <b>is taught</b> in <b>another</b> <i>baraita</i>: <b>“So shall no inheritance transfer from one tribe to another tribe”</b> (Numbers 36:9); <b>the verse speaks of</b> the <b>transfer</b> of the inheritance <b>by means of the husband.</b> The Torah prohibits the woman from marrying a man from a different tribe since her husband will inherit from her, thereby transferring her inheritance away from its original tribe.
<b>Do you say</b> that this is <b>with regard to</b> the <b>transfer</b> of the inheritance <b>by means of the husband, or is it only with regard to</b> the <b>transfer</b> of the inheritance <b>by means of the son? When it says: “So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel transfer from tribe to tribe”</b> (Numbers 36:7), the verse is <b>speaking with regard to</b> the <b>transfer</b> of the inheritance <b>by means of the son. How do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“So shall no inheritance transfer from one tribe to another tribe”</b> (Numbers 36:9)? That <b>verse speaks of</b> the <b>transfer</b> of the inheritance <b>by means of the husband.</b>
The Gemara comments: <b>In any event,</b> according to <b>everyone,</b> i.e., according to both <i>baraitot</i>, the phrase in <b>the verse “from one tribe to another tribe” speaks of</b> the <b>transfer</b> of the inheritance <b>by means of the husband.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is this <b>inferred?</b> The Gemara supplies <b>a mnemonic. Rabba bar Rav Sheila said</b> that the latter part of <b>the verse states:</b> “So shall no inheritance transfer from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave <b>each one [<i>ish</i>]</b> to its own inheritance,” alluding to the transfer by means of the husband, as the word “<i>ish</i>” means husband, in the context of: “Elimelech the husband [<i>ish</i>] of Naomi” (Ruth 1:3). The Gemara asks: But the word <b>“<i>ish</i>” is written in both of</b> the verses. Therefore, both verses should be interpreted with regard to the transfer of the inheritance by means of the husband.
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said</b> a different explanation. The <b>verse states: “Shall cleave,”</b> and this term alludes to marriage, as in the context of: “And he shall cleave to his wife” (Genesis 2:24). The Gemara raises a difficulty: But the term <b>“shall cleave” is written in both of</b> the verses. Therefore, both verses should be interpreted with regard to the transfer of the inheritance by means of the husband.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> a different explanation: The <b>verse states: “The tribes</b> of the children of Israel <b>shall cleave,”</b> and tribes cleave to one another through marriage. <b>Rav Ashi said</b> another explanation: The <b>verse states: “From one tribe to another tribe,” and a son is not</b> considered <b>“another,”</b> as he is an extension of his mother.
§ <b>Rabbi Abbahu says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yannai says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says, and</b> some <b>determined it</b> was <b>in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a husband</b> who inherits from his wife does not <b>take in</b> inheritance the property <b>due</b> to the deceased <b>as</b> he does the property she <b>possessed?</b> Instead of the husband inheriting the property that was due to her, that property is inherited by her other relatives, such as her son, or other relatives of her father. <b>As it is stated: “And Seguv begot Yair, who had twenty three cities in the land of Gilead”</b> (I Chronicles 2:22). The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> did <b>Yair have</b> land <b>that</b> his father, <b>Seguv, did not have? Rather,</b> this <b>teaches that Seguv married a woman and she died in the lifetime of her</b> potential <b>legators, and her legators</b> then <b>died, and Yair,</b> her son, not Seguv, her husband, <b>inherited</b> these inheritances from <b>her.</b>
<b>And it is stated: “And Elazar, the son of Aaron, died; and they buried</b> him in the Hill of Pinehas his son” (Joshua 24:33). <b>From where</b> did <b>Pinehas have</b> land <b>that</b> his father, <b>Elazar, did not have?</b> Rather, this <b>teaches that Elazar married a woman and she died in the lifetime of her</b> potential <b>legators, and her legators</b> then <b>died, and Pinehas</b> her son, not Elazar her husband, <b>inherited</b> the property from <b>her.</b>
<b>And what</b> is the meaning of: <b>And it is stated?</b> Why is it necessary to provide an additional proof beyond the first verse? The Gemara explains. <b>And if you would say:</b> In the verse concerning Seguv and Yair, it is <b>Yair,</b> not Seguv, <b>who married a woman and she died and he inherited</b> from <b>her,</b> and he did not inherit from his mother, <b>the verse states: “And Elazar, the son of Aaron, died;</b> and they buried him in the Hill of Pinehas his son” (Joshua 24:33), teaching that Pinehas inherited the land of those from whom his mother inherited, and Elazar did not. <b>And if you would say that</b> this land <b>came into</b> the possession of Pinehas <b>as a dedicated field,</b> as he was a priest, and he did not inherit it from his mother, <b>the verse states: “His son,”</b> indicating that it was <b>an inheritance that was fitting for him,</b> i.e., Elazar, had his wife not predeceased her legators, <b>and his son inherited it.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And sons of sisters,</b> i.e., nephews born to the sisters of the deceased, inherit from their maternal uncles but do not bequeath to them. <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: This <i>halakha</i> applies to <b>sons of sisters but not</b> to <b>daughters of sisters.</b>

Daf 113b

<b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> was this said? It is obvious that in principle daughters have the right to inherit from their maternal uncle, as the mother inherits from him. <b>Rav Sheshet said:</b> It is said <b>to</b> teach that where there are sons as well, they <b>precede</b> the daughters in inheriting from their maternal uncle.
<b>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Huna:</b> At the end of the passage discussing inheritance of land, the verse states: “Then you shall give his inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family, <b>and he shall inherit</b> it” (Numbers 27:11). The verse <b>juxtaposes a secondary inheritance,</b> that of one inheriting from other relatives, <b>to a primary inheritance,</b> that of a child inheriting from a parent. This teaches that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>a primary inheritance a son precedes a daughter, so too,</b> with regard to <b>a secondary inheritance a son precedes a daughter.</b>
§ <b>Rabba bar Ḥanina taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>before Rav Naḥman:</b> A verse in the passage concerning the double portion inherited by a firstborn states: <b>“Then it shall be on the day that he causes his sons to inherit</b> that which he has” (Deuteronomy 21:16). The addition of the phrase “on the day” teaches that <b>it is</b> specifically <b>during the day</b> that <b>you may distribute inheritances, but you may not distribute inheritances at night. Abaye said to him:</b> That cannot be the <i>halakha</i>, as, <b>if that is so,</b> it ought to be <b>that</b> only <b>one who dies during the day is</b> the one from <b>whom his children inherit,</b> but with regard to <b>one who dies at night, his children do not inherit</b> from <b>him,</b> and this is not the case.
Abaye suggests a different interpretation of Rabba bar Ḥanina’s statement: <b>Perhaps you said</b> a distinction between day and night with regard to the <b>adjudication of inheritances,</b> as judges are permitted to sit only during the day. A proof for this distinction is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: A verse in the passage concerning inheritance states: <b>“And it shall be for the children of Israel a statute of judgment”</b> (Numbers 27:11), teaching that <b>the entire portion was placed [<i>ure’a</i>]</b> together <b>to be</b> considered a matter of <b>judgment,</b> subject to the procedural rules of a court matter.
Abaye continues: <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Yehuda, as Rav Yehuda says:</b> In a case where there were <b>three</b> men <b>who entered</b> a room <b>to visit a sick person</b> and the sick person desired to write a will in order to distribute his property following his death, if the visitors <b>wish</b> to do so <b>they may write</b> his will and sign it as witnesses. And if <b>they wish, they may act</b> in <b>judgment,</b> i.e., they may act as a court in the matter, since there are three of them. Therefore, they can determine that the will has the validity of an act of court and transfer the property to the heirs in their capacity as a court. But if only <b>two</b> came to visit the sick person, <b>they may write</b> the will and sign it as witnesses, <b>but they may not act</b> in <b>judgment,</b> since three are required to form a court. <b>And Rav Ḥisda says:</b> This <i>halakha</i> was <b>taught only</b> in a case where the three came to visit him <b>during the day,</b>

Daf 114a

<b>but</b> if they came <b>at night, even</b> if <b>three</b> men came to visit the sick person, <b>they may write</b> the will and sign it as witnesses <b>but they may not act</b> in <b>judgment. What is the reason</b> that they may not act in judgment the next day? It is <b>because they are</b> already <b>witnesses</b> to the will of the deceased, <b>and</b> there is a principle that <b>a witness cannot become a judge,</b> i.e., one who acts as a witness in a particular matter cannot become a judge with regard to that same matter? Rabba bar Ḥanina <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>Yes,</b> it <b>is indeed so;</b> this is what <b>I was saying.</b>
§ After mentioning Rav Yehuda’s ruling the Gemara cites a related dispute. It <b>was stated:</b> With regard to <b>a transaction, until when</b> may one of the parties <b>renege</b> on the transaction? <b>Rabba says: As long as they are seated</b> in the same location they may renege on the transaction. <b>Rav Yosef says: As long as they are dealing with that matter,</b> i.e., they are still discussing that transaction, they may renege on it.
<b>Rav Yosef said: It stands to reason in accordance with my opinion, as Rav Yehuda says:</b> In a case where there were <b>three</b> men <b>who entered</b> a room <b>to visit a sick person</b> and the sick person desires to write a will in order to distribute his property following his death, if the visitors <b>wish</b> to do so <b>they may write</b> his will and sign it as witnesses. And if <b>they wish, they may act</b> in <b>judgment. And if it enters your mind</b> that one may renege on a deal <b>as long as they are seated</b> in the same location, then <b>let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he will renege on</b> his decision. How can the visitors act in judgment in a case where the matter has not been resolved, as the sick person may still change his mind?
<b>Rav Ashi said: I stated this <i>halakha</i> before Rav Kahana</b> and I asked him: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Yosef, does it work out well? But</b> even according to his opinion there <b>should be a concern</b> that <b>perhaps he will renege on</b> his decision, as Rav Yosef holds that one may renege on a transaction as long as the two parties are still dealing with that matter. <b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> That according to Rav Yosef, Rav Yehuda’s ruling applies <b>where they withdrew</b>

Daf 114b

<b>from</b> discussing that <b>matter to</b> discuss a different <b>matter,</b> so he can no longer renege on his decision. <b>So too,</b> according to Rabba, one can explain that Rav Yehuda was referring to a case <b>where they arose and then sat</b> down again. Although no support for Rav Yosef’s opinion was adduced from Rav Yehuda’s ruling, the Gemara nevertheless states: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef in</b> the disputes concerning the division of <b>a field,</b> discussed above (12b), reneging while they are discussing the same <b>matter,</b> discussed here, <b>and a half</b> of one’s property, discussed below (143a).
§ The mishna teaches that <b>a woman</b> bequeaths to <b>her son,</b> her husband, and her maternal uncles, but she does not inherit from them. The Gemara asks: <b>Why do I</b> need <b>this as well? But it is</b> already <b>taught</b> in <b>the former clause: A man</b> inherits from <b>his mother and a man</b> inherits from <b>his wife.</b> The <i>halakha</i> stated in this clause seems to be the same as that of the other clause.
The Gemara answers: <b>This teaches us that</b> the <i>halakha</i> of <b>a woman</b> who bequeaths to <b>her son</b> is <b>similar to that</b> of <b>a woman</b> who bequeaths to <b>her husband: Just as</b> with regard to <b>a woman</b> who bequeaths to <b>her husband, the husband does not inherit</b> property through <b>his wife</b> while he is <b>in the grave,</b> i.e., if a husband predeceases his wife, then his relatives, such as children from another marriage, do not inherit the wife’s property through him but rather the wife’s own relatives inherit her property, <b>so too,</b> the same <i>halakha</i> applies with regard to <b>a woman</b> who bequeaths to <b>her son,</b> that <b>the son does not inherit</b> property through <b>his mother</b> while he is <b>in the grave</b> in order <b>to bequeath to his paternal brothers.</b> In both cases, the woman’s own relatives inherit her property.
§ With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that a mother inherits from her son, the Gemara notes that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Yehuda ben Rabbi Shimon: By Torah law a father inherits</b> from <b>his son, and a woman inherits</b> from <b>her son</b> if the father is no longer alive, <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to a woman receiving inheritance: “And every daughter who possesses an inheritance from the <b>tribes</b> of the children of Israel” (Numbers 36:8). Since the plural term “tribes” includes both her father’s tribe and her mother’s tribe, the verse <b>juxtaposes</b> the <b>tribe of the mother to the tribe of the father,</b> in that <b>just as</b> with regard to <b>the father’s tribe a father inherits</b> from <b>his son, so too,</b> with regard to <b>the mother’s tribe, a woman inherits</b> from <b>her son</b> if the father is deceased.

Daf 115a

<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon</b> from the mishna, which teaches: <b>A woman</b> with regard to <b>her son, a woman</b> with regard to <b>her husband, and maternal uncles</b> all <b>bequeath</b> to their respective relatives <b>but do not inherit</b> from them. The mishna states explicitly that a mother does not inherit her son’s property. Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon <b>said to him:</b> With regard to <b>our mishna, I do not know who taught it,</b> i.e., I am not aware of any <i>tanna</i> who concurs with its ruling and it is not the accepted <i>halakha</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>But let</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>say to</b> Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon that the mishna <b>is</b> written in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav, who,</b> as noted on page 111a, <b>does not derive</b> the <i>halakha</i> that sons precede daughters with regard to the inheritance of their mother from the word <b>“tribes.”</b> Since Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon’s ruling is based on a derivation from the word “tribes,” it stands to reason that Rabbi Zekharya disagrees with Rabbi Yehuda ben Shimon, and the ruling of the mishna is in accordance with Rabbi Zekharya’s opinion.
The Gemara answers: <b>The mishna cannot be interpreted in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav, as it teaches: And the sons of a sister</b> inherit but do not bequeath, <b>and</b> a Sage <b>taught</b> that the mishna is referring only to <b>sons of a sister and not</b> to <b>daughters of a sister, and we say: With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is there a distinction between the sons and daughters of a sister? <b>And Rav Sheshet said:</b> The distinction is meant <b>to</b> teach that where there are sons as well, they <b>precede</b> the daughters in inheriting from their maternal uncle.
The Gemara continues: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>the mishna is</b> written in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Zekharya ben HaKatzav, doesn’t he say: Both the son and the daughter are equal with regard to the mother’s property,</b> as they inherit equally? The mishna stands in contraposition to Rabbi Zekharya’s ruling, and therefore it cannot be written in accordance with his opinion.
The Gemara asks: <b>And the <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna, <b>whichever</b> way <b>you</b> look at it, is inconsistent: <b>If he interprets</b> the word <b>“tribes,”</b> then <b>a woman also should inherit</b> from <b>her son,</b> as noted above (114b). And <b>if he does not interpret</b> the word <b>“tribes,”</b> then <b>from where is it</b> clear <b>to him</b> that <b>a son precedes a daughter with regard to</b> the <b>property of the mother?</b> Both <i>halakhot</i> are derived from the same source, so how can the <i>tanna</i> accept one and reject the other?
The Gemara explains: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna <b>inter-prets</b> the word <b>“tribes,” but it is different here,</b> with regard to a woman inheriting from her son, <b>as the verse states: “And every daughter</b> who <b>possesses [<i>yoreshet</i>] an inheritance</b> from the tribes” (Numbers 36:8), which teaches that a daughter <b>inherits [<i>yoreshet</i>]</b> from two tribes, <b>but</b> she <b>does not bequeath</b> to two tribes. She bequeaths only to her father’s tribe.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> The <b>order</b> of precedence with regard to <b>inheritances is this:</b> The verse states: <b>“If a man dies, and has no son, then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter”</b> (Numbers 27:8). This teaches that <b>a son precedes a daughter.</b> Additionally, <b>all descendants of a son precede a daughter. A daughter precedes the brothers</b> of the deceased. Additionally, the <b>descendants of a daughter precede the brothers</b> of the deceased. <b>Brothers</b> of the deceased <b>precede the uncles</b> of the deceased. Additionally, the <b>descendants of the brothers precede the uncles.</b>
<b>This is the principle:</b> Concerning <b>anyone who precedes</b> another <b>with regard to inheritance, his descendants precede</b> the other as well, <b>and a father</b> who inherits <b>precedes all of his descendants.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught:</b> The verse states: “If a man dies, and has no <b>son,</b> then you shall pass his inheritance to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a son</b> precedes others with regard to the inheritance of the deceased; <b>from where</b> do I derive that <b>a son of a son, or a daughter of a son, or a son of a daughter of a son</b> also precedes the deceased’s other relatives? <b>The verse states:</b> “If a man dies, and <b>he has no [<i>ein lo</i>]</b> son.” The word <i>ein</i> is written <i>aleph</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>nun</i>. Therefore, the Sages read it as if it states: <b>Investigate with regard to him [<i>ayyein alav</i>],</b> to search for descendants of his son, and give the inheritance to them if they are found.
The next verse states: “And if he has no <b>daughter,</b> then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers” (Numbers 27:9). <b>I have</b> derived <b>only</b> that <b>a daughter</b> precedes others, except a son and his descendants, with regard to the inheritance of the deceased, <b>from where</b> then do I derive that <b>a daughter’s daughter, or a son of a daughter, or a daughter of a son of a daughter</b> also precede the deceased’s other relatives? <b>The verse states:</b> “And if he <b>has no [<i>ein lo</i>]</b> daughter.” The word <i>ein</i> is written <i>aleph</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>nun</i>. Therefore, the Sages read it as if it states: <b>Investigate with regard to him [<i>ayyein alav</i>],</b> to search for descendants of his daughter, and give the inheritance to them if they are found.

Daf 115b

The Gemara asks: <b>How so,</b> i.e., how is the investigation performed when he has no offspring at all? The Gemara answers: The family lineage that determines the <b>inheritance is successively examined up to Reuben,</b> son of Jacob, i.e., the heirs are determined by investigating the family genealogy, and that investigation can extend all the way to Reuben, son of our forefather Jacob. The Gemara asks: <b>And let</b> it <b>say: Until Jacob</b> himself, rather than until Reuben, since if none of Reuven’s descendants survive, one would have to examine Jacob’s descendants. <b>Abaye said</b> in reply: It <b>is learned</b> as a tradition <b>that a tribe will not be eliminated</b> entirely, and some descendants will always remain.
§ <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who says</b> that <b>a daughter</b> of the deceased <b>should inherit</b> the estate of her father along <b>with the daughter of the son</b> of the deceased, <b>even</b> if he is <b>a prince of the Jewish people,</b> one <b>should not listen to him, as this is nothing other than an act of the Sadducees,</b> and runs counter to the ruling of the mishna that the descendants of a son inherit before a daughter. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> in <i>Megillat Ta’anit</i>, which describes various minor holidays on which it is forbidden to fast or eulogize: <b>On the twenty-fourth of Tevet, we returned to our law,</b> i.e., the <i>halakha</i> was reestablished in accordance with the opinion of the Sages after having been dictated by the Sadducees. <b>As the Sadducees would say: A daughter should inherit</b> the estate of her father along <b>with the daughter of the son</b> of the deceased.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai joined them</b> to discuss their ruling, and <b>said to them: Imbeciles, from where</b> do <b>you</b> derive <b>this</b> ruling? <b>And there was no person that answered him anything, except for one old</b> man <b>who was chattering at him and saying</b> that it is an <i>a fortiori</i> inference: <b>And just as a daughter of</b> the deceased’s <b>son, who comes</b> to claim her inheritance from her grandfather <b>by virtue of his son, inherits</b> her grandfather’s property, so too, with regard to the deceased’s own <b>daughter, who comes</b> to inherit <b>by virtue of</b> the deceased, <b>all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that she should inherit his property?
Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>recited this verse about him: “These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan and Shobal and Zibeon and Anah”</b> (Genesis 36:20), <b>and it is written: “And these are the children of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah”</b> (Genesis 36:24). The first verse portrays Zibeon and Anah as brothers, while the second states that they are father and son. <b>Rather,</b> this <b>teaches that Zibeon engaged in sexual intercourse with his mother and begot Anah,</b> so that he was both Anah’s father and his brother. From the fact that the first verse equates Zibeon and Anah by referring to both of them as Seir’s sons despite Anah being a grandson of Seir, it is clear that grandchildren are equal to children, contrary to the Sadducees’ assertion.
The Gemara interrupts the recounting of the <i>baraita</i> and questions Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai’s inference: <b>But perhaps there were two</b> people named <b>Anah,</b> so that one Anah was Zibeon’s son, and the other his brother? <b>Rabba said: I will state a matter</b> that even <b>King Shapur did not state. And who is</b> this King Shapur? This cannot be a reference to Shapur, king of Persia; rather, it must be a moniker for someone else. He is <b>Shmuel,</b> whose legal rulings were accepted by the public like the edicts of a king by his subjects. <b>Some state</b> a different version, that it was <b>Rav Pappa</b> who <b>said: I will state a matter</b> that even <b>King Shapur did not state. And who is</b> this King Shapur? He is <b>Rabba. The verse</b> goes on to <b>state: “This is Anah”</b> (Genesis 36:24), indicating that <b>he is</b> the same <b>Anah</b> mentioned <b>initially,</b> earlier in the verse. Accordingly, there was only one Anah, who was both Zibeon’s brother and Zibeon’s son.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: The Sadducee <b>said to</b> Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai: <b>My teacher, you dismiss me with this</b> retort? I agree that the son of a son precedes a daughter, as the verse you quoted suggests; I am asserting that a daughter inherits together with the daughter of a son, and the verse you quoted has no bearing on that claim. Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai <b>said to him: Imbecile,</b>

Daf 116a

<b>but will our perfect Torah not be</b> as worthy <b>as your frivolous speech,</b> as your inference is fallacious: <b>What</b> is notable <b>about</b> the inheritance of <b>a daughter of</b> the deceased’s <b>son?</b> It is notable <b>in that her right is enhanced</b> in that she inherits from her paternal grandfather together <b>with the brothers</b> of her father. Would you <b>say</b> that the same applies <b>with regard to</b> the deceased’s <b>daughter, whose right</b> to inherit <b>is diminished</b> in that she does not inherit from her father together <b>with</b> her <b>brothers?</b> The Sadducee’s <i>a fortiori</i> inference is thereby disproved. The Gemara concludes: <b>And</b> since the Sadducees had no counterargument, the Sages <b>were victorious over them, and they established that day,</b> the twenty-fourth of Tevet, as a minor <b>festival</b> to celebrate the establishment of the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with the opinion of the Sages.
Having discussed the <i>halakha</i> of a son’s daughter’s right to inheritance, the Gemara cites a verse that relates to the matter. After the incident known as: The concubine in Gibeah, the men of the tribe of Benjamin numbered only six hundred, and each of these men had inherited large plots of land from their deceased relatives. The verse states: <b>“And they said: They that are escaped must be as an inheritance for Benjamin, that a tribe be not blotted out from Israel”</b> (Judges 21:17).
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak of the house of Rabbi Ami says:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> the elders of that generation <b>stipulated with regard to the tribe of Benjamin that a daughter of a son shall not inherit with the brothers</b> of her father. Since the daughter of a son who inherits her grandfather’s property may later bequeath it to her husband, who may be from another tribe, the elders instituted this temporary ordinance in order to ensure that other tribes would not inherit large quantities of land belonging to the tribe of Benjamin, lest the tribe of Benjamin be left with little land of its own.
§ The Gemara presents a related statement. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> Concerning <b>anyone who does not leave</b> behind <b>a son to inherit</b> from <b>him, the Holy One, Blessed be He, is filled with wrath [<i>evra</i>] toward him,</b> as <b>it is written here:</b> “If a man die, and he has no son, <b>then you shall pass his inheritance [<i>veha’avartem</i>]</b> to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8), <b>and it is written there: “That day is a day of wrath [<i>evra</i>]”</b> (Zephaniah 1:15). The words “<i>veha’avartem</i>” and “<i>evra</i>” share common root letters, whereby Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai interprets that God’s wrath may be the result of the inheritance passing to a daughter rather than a son.
The Gemara presents a related statement. Concerning the verse: “God shall hear, and humble them, even He that is enthroned of old, Selah; <b>those that have no exchange, and fear not God”</b> (Psalms 55:20), <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi</b> each interpret the verse in a different manner. <b>One says</b> that this is a reference to <b>anyone who does not leave</b> behind <b>a son</b> to inherit from him, as he does not leave anyone to serve in exchange, i.e., as a replacement, for him; <b>and one says</b> that this is a reference to <b>anyone who does not leave</b> behind <b>a student</b> to serve in exchange for him.
The Gemara suggests: <b>It may be concluded</b> that it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan who says</b> that the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind <b>a student, for Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> whose ten sons died in his lifetime, <b>said</b> to those he would console: <b>This is the bone of my tenth son,</b> to encourage them not to succumb to their sorrow. Since Rabbi Yoḥanan knew that he would not leave any sons to inherit his property, it is reasonable to assume that he interpreted the verse as meaning that God is full of wrath toward one who does not leave behind a student. The Gemara comments that <b>it may be concluded that</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan who says</b> that the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind <b>a student.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And from</b> this, <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is the one who <b>says</b> that the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind <b>a student,</b> it follows that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says</b> the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind <b>a son.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> this cannot be, as <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi would not go to a house of mourning [<i>bei tamya</i>]</b> to console the bereaved so as not to interrupt his studies, <b>except to the house of one who died without any sons, as it is written:</b> “Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him; but <b>weep sore for him that goes away”</b> (Jeremiah 22:10), <b>and Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that the verse is referring <b>to</b> one who <b>departs</b> from this world <b>without</b> leaving behind <b>a male child.</b> From the fact that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi would console specifically one who died without leaving a son, it is apparent that he does not hold that God is full of wrath toward such an individual. <b>Rather,</b> it must be that <b>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is</b> the Sage <b>who says</b> that the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind <b>a student.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And from</b> this <b>that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi is</b> the one <b>who says</b> that the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind <b>a student,</b> it follows that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> it is referring to one who does not leave behind <b>a son.</b>
The Gemara asks: This poses <b>a difficulty</b> from one statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> that the verse is referring to one who does not leave behind a son, <b>to</b> another statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan,</b> as he would say: This is the bone of my tenth son. The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult: This</b> statement, with regard to the bone of his son, <b>is his,</b> while <b>that</b> statement, with regard to the verse, <b>is his teacher’s.</b>
§ The Gemara continues with three homiletic interpretations by Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ḥama, and provides <b>a mnemonic</b> to facilitate the memorization of these expositions: <b>Hadad, poverty, and sage.</b>
The Gemara presents the first homiletic interpretation: <b>Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ḥama interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead”</b> (I Kings 11:21)? <b>For what</b> reason is it that <b>in</b> the case of King <b>David, sleeping was stated with regard to his</b> demise, <b>and in</b> the case of <b>Joab, death was stated with regard to his</b> demise? He answers: Concerning King <b>David, who left a son</b> behind, <b>sleeping was stated with regard to his</b> demise, as it was not a complete death, while concerning <b>Joab, who did not leave a son</b> behind, <b>death was stated with regard to his</b> demise, as he left no son to succeed him.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>Joab did not leave a son</b> behind; <b>but isn’t it written: “Of the sons of Joab: Obadiah, son of Jehiel”</b> (Ezra 8:9)? <b>Rather,</b> concerning King <b>David, who left a son as</b> great as <b>himself, sleeping was stated with regard to his</b> demise, but concerning <b>Joab, who did not leave a son as</b> great as <b>himself, death was stated with regard to his</b> demise.
The Gemara presents the second homiletic interpretation: <b>Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ḥama interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically,</b> and derived that <b>poverty in a person’s household is more difficult than fifty plagues, as it is stated: “Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O you my friends; for the hand of God has touched me”</b> (Job 19:21), <b>and his friends were saying to him: “Take heed, regard not iniquity; for this have you chosen rather than poverty”</b> (Job 36:21). Job, who suffered many plagues, was told by his friends that his suffering was preferable to poverty.
The Gemara presents the third homiletic interpretation: <b>Rabbi Pineḥas bar Ḥama interpreted</b> a verse <b>homiletically: Anyone who has a sick person in his home should go to a sage, and</b> the sage will <b>ask</b> for <b>mercy on</b> the sick person’s behalf, <b>as it is stated: “The wrath of a king is as messengers of death; but a wise man will pacify it”</b> (Proverbs 16:14).
§ The mishna teaches that <b>this is the principle:</b> Concerning <b>anyone who precedes</b> another <b>with regard to inheritance, his descendants precede</b> the other as well, <b>and a father precedes all of his descendants. Rami bar Ḥama raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to the claim of <b>a father of the</b> deceased’s <b>father and</b> the claim of <b>the brother of the</b> deceased’s <b>father, such as</b> the claims of <b>Abraham and Ishmael to the property of Esau,</b> who was Abraham’s grandson and Ishmael’s nephew, <b>which of them precedes</b> the other and inherits the property? <b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: <b>A father precedes all of his descendants,</b> therefore, Abraham would inherit, as Ishmael was his descendant. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why did <b>Rami bar Ḥama</b> have a dilemma; was he not aware of the statement of the mishna?

Daf 116b

The Gemara answers: <b>Due to his keen</b> mind, <b>he did not analyze</b> the mishna carefully.
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raised a dilemma:</b> With regard to the claim of <b>a father of the</b> deceased’s <b>father and</b> the claim of the deceased’s <b>brother, such as</b> the claims of <b>Abraham and Jacob to the property of Esau,</b> who was Abraham’s grandson and Jacob’s brother, <b>which of them precedes</b> the other and inherits the property? <b>Rava said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: <b>A father precedes all of his descendants,</b> therefore, Abraham would inherit, as Jacob was his descendant. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why did <b>Rami bar Ḥama</b> have a dilemma; presumably, he was aware of the statement of the mishna? The Gemara answers: Rami bar Ḥama understood that the mishna teaches that a father <b>precedes</b> only <b>his own</b> immediate <b>descendants, but not the descendants of his son.</b>
The Gemara notes that <b>so too, it is reasonable</b> to understand the mishna in that manner, <b>as it teaches: This is the principle: Anyone who precedes</b> another <b>with regard to inheritance, his descendants precede</b> the other as well. <b>And if Isaac were</b> alive, <b>Isaac</b> would <b>precede</b> Abraham and inherit Esau’s property. <b>Now, also, when Isaac is not</b> alive, <b>Jacob</b> should <b>precede</b> Abraham, because of the principle that the descendants of one who precedes another with regard to inheritance also precede the other. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> this clause of the mishna that the brother of the deceased precedes the grandfather.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Zelophehad’s daughters took three portions</b> of land <b>in</b> the <b>inheritance</b> of Eretz Yisrael: <b>Their father’s portion</b> that he received <b>because he was among those who left Egypt; and his portion</b> that he received <b>with his brothers in</b> the <b>property of Hepher,</b> their father; <b>and</b> an additional portion that he received from Hepher <b>because he was a firstborn,</b> and a firstborn <b>takes two portions</b> of inheritance from his father.

Daf 117a

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara comments: In the mishna that teaches that Zelophehad and Hepher were entitled to portions in Eretz Yisrael, <b>we learned in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>one who says: Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>was divided among those who left Egypt.</b>
The Gemara cites a <i>baraita</i> that presents three opinions as to how Eretz Yisrael was divided. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yoshiya says: Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>was divided among those who left Egypt, as it is stated: “According to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit”</b> (Numbers 26:55), which teaches that the Jewish people would inherit Eretz Yisrael according to the names of their fathers, i.e., those who left Egypt. Rabbi Yoshiya continues: <b>But how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance”</b> (Numbers 26:53), which indicates that the land was to be divided among those recently counted in the wilderness, i.e., those who would enter Eretz Yisrael? He answers: <b>“Unto these”</b> teaches that the land will be divided among those who are <b>like these</b> people who were counted, in that they were adults above the age of twenty, <b>to exclude the children,</b> who were not entitled to a portion in Eretz Yisrael, as they were not of age at the time of the Exodus.
The <i>baraita</i> presents a second opinion. <b>Rabbi Yonatan says: Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>was divided among those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>as it is stated: “Unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance”</b> (Numbers 26:53). <b>But how do I realize</b> the meaning of the verse: <b>“According to the names of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit”</b> (Numbers 26:55)? This teaches that <b>this inheritance is different from all</b> other <b>inheritances in the world, for</b> in <b>all</b> other <b>inheritances in the world,</b> the <b>living inherit</b> from the <b>dead, but here, the dead inherit</b> from the <b>living.</b> In other words, the portions of land received by those who entered Eretz Yisrael were transferred to their fathers who left Egypt, and then inherited by the current generation, as the Gemara will now explain.
<b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: I will tell you a parable. To what is this matter comparable? To two brothers</b> who were <b>priests</b> and <b>who were in one town. One</b> brother <b>has one son, and one</b> brother <b>has two sons, and</b> the sons all <b>went to the threshing floor</b> to collect <i>teruma</i>. <b>This</b> brother, <b>who has one son, takes one portion</b> of the <i>teruma</i> from his child, <b>and that</b> brother, <b>who has two sons, takes two portions</b> from his sons. <b>And</b> the brothers then <b>return</b> with the three portions <b>to their father, and</b> then <b>redivide</b> the portions among themselves <b>equally,</b> so that each brother receives one and one-half portions. When the brothers give their shares to their children, the son of the first brother will receive all that his father had received, while the sons of the other brother will divide what their father had received.
The <i>baraita</i> presents a third opinion. <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar says:</b>

Daf 117b

<b>Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>was divided to these and to those, so as to uphold these two verses. How so?</b> If one <b>was from</b> among <b>those who left Egypt, he takes his portion</b> along <b>with those who left Egypt.</b> If one <b>was from</b> among <b>those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>he takes his portion</b> along <b>with those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael. If one was <b>from</b> both <b>here and there,</b> i.e., he was among those who left Egypt and also entered Eretz Yisrael himself, <b>he takes his portion from here and there,</b> as he is entitled to two portions.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: With regard to the twelve <b>spies</b> sent to survey Eretz Yisrael prior to the Jewish people’s entry into the land, <b>Joshua and Caleb took</b> all of the spies’ <b>portions</b> of the land. Additionally, the <b>protesters and the assembly of Korah did not have a portion of Eretz</b> Yisrael. Nevertheless, their <b>sons took</b> portions of the land <b>in the merit of their paternal grandfathers and in the merit of their maternal grandfathers</b> if they were among those who left Egypt. This concludes the Gemara’s citation of the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred that this</b> verse, which states: <b>“According to the names of the tribes of their fathers</b> they shall inherit” (Numbers 26:55), <b>is written with regard to those who left Egypt; perhaps</b> the verse <b>was stated</b> in reference <b>to</b> the progenitors of the <b>tribes,</b> and teaches that the land should be divided among the twelve tribes? The Gemara answers: The inference is from a verse, <b>as it is written:</b> “And I will bring you in to the land, concerning which I lifted up My hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; <b>and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the Lord”</b> (Exodus 6:8). This verse states that Eretz Yisrael <b>is an inheritance for you from your forefathers, and</b> this verse <b>was told to those who left Egypt,</b> indicating that those who left Egypt inherit the land.
The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> device for the following series of questions posed by Rav Pappa to Abaye relating to the division of Eretz Yisrael: <b>To the more; Zelophehad; and Joseph; contested; Manasseh; will count.</b>
The Gemara presents the first question. <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>was divided among those who left Egypt, this is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “To the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance”</b> (Numbers 26:54). The verse may be understood as teaching the novelty that even though the number of Jewish people entering Eretz Yisrael differed from the number who left Egypt, the land is nevertheless divided according to the numbers at the time of the Exodus, not according to the count at the time they received the land.

Daf 118a

<b>But according to the one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>what</b> does the verse: <b>“To the more you shall give the more inheritance”</b> teach? It is obvious that larger families will receive more land due to their greater numbers. The Gemara concludes: This poses <b>a difficulty</b> to one who holds that opinion.
The Gemara presents the second question. <b>And Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Granted, according to the one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who left Egypt, this is</b> why <b>the daughters of Zelophehad cried out</b> in protest of the fact that they would be denied their father’s portion, to which he was entitled as one who left Egypt. <b>But according to the one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>why did they cry out</b> in protest; after all, Zelophehad <b>was not</b> there <b>to take</b> his portion, so his daughters should have no claim to the land?
Abaye answers: <b>Rather,</b> according to this opinion, the protest of Zelophehad’s daughters was in reference <b>to the returning</b> of the portions from the generation that entered Eretz Yisrael to the generation that left Egypt, as described in the <i>baraita</i> above. <b>And</b> accordingly, Zelophehad’s daughters demanded <b>to take</b> their portion <b>in</b> the <b>property of</b> their grandfather <b>Hepher,</b> who received land posthumously through his children, their uncles.
The Gemara presents Rav Pappa’s third question: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who left Egypt, this is</b> why <b>the descendants of Joseph cried out</b> in protest of the fact that they would receive an inadequate portion of land due to the fact that they had proliferated greatly in the wilderness. <b>As it is written: “And the children of Joseph spoke</b> to Joshua, saying: Why have you given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I am a great people, because the Lord has blessed me thus” (Joshua 17:14). <b>But according to the one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>what</b> is the reason <b>they were crying out? They</b> were <b>all</b> entitled to <b>take</b> their own portion of land and should have had no cause for complaint.
The Gemara answers: They protested <b>due to the children, as they had many</b> children who were not entitled to a portion of the land.
<b>Abaye said: Learn from</b> the fact that the Bible records the complaints of only the daughters of Zelophehad and the descendants of Joseph that <b>there was not one</b> other individual <b>who did not take</b> a portion of land; <b>as if it enters your mind</b> that <b>there was</b> even <b>one</b> other <b>who did not take</b> a portion of land, <b>he should have cried out</b> in protest. <b>And if you would say: The verse wrote</b> about one <b>who cried out and</b> his protest <b>was effective,</b> and <b>the verse did not write</b> about one <b>who cried out and</b> his protest <b>was not effective,</b> that is difficult. <b>But</b> there is the counterexample of <b>the descendants of Joseph, who cried out and</b> their protest <b>was not effective, and the verse wrote</b> about <b>them.</b>
The Gemara rejects Abaye’s inference: Generally, the verse would not record an instance where one cried out if his protest was not effective, and <b>there,</b> the verse includes the protest of Joseph’s descendants in order to <b>teach us</b> a measure of <b>good advice: That a person should be wary of the evil eye. And this is what Joshua said to them, as it is written: “And Joshua said unto them: If you be a great people, go up to the forest,</b> and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the Rephaim” (Joshua 17:15). Joshua <b>said to them: Go and conceal yourselves in the forests so that the evil eye will not have dominion over you.</b>

Daf 118b

Joseph’s descendants <b>said to him: We are of the descendants of Joseph,</b> upon <b>whom the evil eye had no dominion, as it is written: “Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a fountain [<i>alei ayin</i>]”</b> (Genesis 49:22), <b>and Rabbi Abbahu states</b> a homiletic interpretation: <b>Do not read</b> it as <b>“<i>alei ayin</i>,” rather</b> read it as <b><i>olei ayin</i>,</b> above the eye, i.e., he transcended the influence of the evil eye. Joseph’s descendants were saying that they also do not need to be wary.
<b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, said</b> that a proof for the notion that the evil eye holds no sway over Joseph and his descendants, is <b>from here,</b> Jacob’s blessing of Joseph’s sons, Ephraim and Manasseh: “The angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named in them, and the name of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac; <b>and let them grow into a multitude [<i>veyidgu</i>] in the midst of the earth”</b> (Genesis 48:16). <i>Veyidgu</i> is related etymologically to the word for fish [<i>dag</i>]. <b>Just as</b> with regard to <b>the fish in the sea, water covers them and the</b> evil <b>eye has no dominion over them, so too, the seed of Joseph, the</b> evil <b>eye has no dominion over them.</b>
§ The Gemara analyzes the next section of the <i>baraita</i>, which states: With regard to the twelve <b>spies</b> sent to survey Eretz Yisrael prior to the Jewish people’s entry into the land, <b>Joshua and Caleb took</b> all of the spies’ <b>portions</b> of the land. The Gemara asks: <b>From where is this matter</b> derived? <b>Ulla said:</b> It is <b>as the verse states: “But Joshua, son of Nun, and Caleb, son of Jephunneh, lived of those men</b> that went to spy out the land” (Numbers 14:38). <b>What</b> does the term <b>“lived”</b> mean? <b>If we say</b> that it means <b>literally</b> that <b>they lived, but</b> there is <b>another verse</b> that <b>states: “And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb, son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, son of Nun”</b> (Numbers 26:65), so why would the Torah state it twice? <b>Rather, what</b> does the term <b>“lived”</b> mean? <b>That</b> Joshua and Caleb <b>lived in</b> the other spies’ <b>portion</b> of the land.
The <i>baraita</i> teaches that the <b>protesters and the assembly of Korah did not possess a portion of Eretz</b> Yisrael. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> otherwise in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to the <b>spies,</b> the <b>protesters, and the assembly of Korah, Joshua and Caleb took their portions</b> of the land? Apparently, the protesters and the assembly of Korah were assigned portions in Eretz Yisrael, which were then given to Joshua and Caleb. The Gemara answers: It is <b>not difficult:</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> quoted earlier, <b>juxtaposes</b> the <b>protesters to the spies,</b> teaching that just as the spies were assigned a portion of Eretz Yisrael, so were the protesters. And one <b>Sage,</b> the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> quoted here, <b>does not juxtapose</b> the <b>protesters to the spies.</b> Although the spies were assigned a portion, the protesters were not.
The Gemara quotes a related <i>baraita</i>. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse quotes the daughters of Zelophehad: “Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among the assembly of them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the assembly of Korah, but he died in his own sin; and he had no sons” (Numbers 27:3), and the daughters of Zelophehad therefore claim they are entitled to his portion. <b>“Our father died in the wilderness,” this</b> is referring to <b>Zelophehad. “And he was not among the assembly,” this</b> is referring to the <b>assembly of spies. “That gathered themselves together against the Lord,” these</b> are the <b>protesters. “In the assembly of Korah,”</b> this is <b>in accordance with its</b> straightforward <b>meaning.</b> It is clear from this verse that those in these categories were not entitled to a portion in Eretz Yisrael.
The Gemara concludes: One <b>Sage juxtaposes</b> the <b>protesters to the spies,</b> so that Joshua and Caleb inherited the portions of both; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage does not juxtapose</b> the <b>protesters to the spies.</b>
The Gemara presents Rav Pappa’s fourth question. <b>And Rav Pappa said to Abaye: And according to the one who juxtaposes</b> the <b>protesters to the spies,</b> is it reasonable that <b>Joshua and Caleb contested</b> the spies <b>and inherited all of Eretz Yisrael?</b> Many of the Jewish people protested in the wilderness at one point or another, and it cannot be that Joshua and Caleb received all of their portions by virtue of not participating in the sin of the spies. Abaye <b>said to him: We are referring to</b> the <b>protesters who were among the assembly of Korah.</b> This term is not referring to all those who protested, but rather to the 250 individuals who protested along with Korah, and it is their portions of land that Joshua and Caleb received.
The Gemara returns to the <i>baraita</i> and presents the fifth question. <b>And Rav Pappa said to Abaye: Granted, according to the one who says</b> that <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>was divided among those who left Egypt, this is as it is written</b> with regard to the inheritance of the tribe of Manasseh: <b>“And ten parts fell to Manasseh,</b> beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan; because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons” (Joshua 17:5–6). <b>Six</b> were the portions <b>of the six fathers’ houses</b> of Manasseh listed in a previous verse (Joshua 17:2), <b>and four</b> parts <b>of</b> the daughters of Zelophehad; <b>that</b> is <b>ten</b> parts.
<b>But according to the one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among</b> those <b>who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>there were eight</b> parts, as follows: <b>Six</b> were the portions <b>of the six fathers’ houses, and two of theirs,</b> which they received from the estate of their grandfather Hepher, of whom Zelophehad was the firstborn; <b>that</b> is <b>eight.</b> Zelophehad himself, by contrast, was not entitled to a portion, as he did not enter Eretz Yisrael.
The Gemara objects: <b>And according to your reasoning, but</b> even <b>according to the one who says</b> that <b>Eretz</b> Yisrael <b>was divided among those who left Egypt, there are</b> only <b>nine</b> parts, as the mishna (116b) states that Zelophehad’s daughters took three parts. <b>Rather, what have you to say?</b> How can the mishna be reconciled with the verse? One must say that according to the opinion that Eretz Yisrael was divided among those who left Egypt, <b>they had one</b> unmentioned <b>paternal uncle</b> who died without children, and Zelophehad’s estate received a share of his portion. <b>So too,</b> according to the opinion that Eretz Yisrael was divided among those who entered Eretz Yisrael, it could be said that <b>they had two</b> unmentioned <b>paternal uncles,</b> so that they received two additional portions of land.
The fact that they received a portion from an uncle may be derived from a verse. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that the verse states: <b>“You shall give [<i>naton titten</i>] them</b> a possession of an inheritance” (Numbers 27:7). <b>This</b> is referring to the <b>inheritance of their father.</b> The verse continues: <b>“Among their father’s brothers”; this</b> is referring to the <b>inheritance of their father’s father.</b> The verse continues: <b>“And you shall pass the inheritance of their father to them”; this</b> is referring to the <b>portion of the firstborn</b> to which Zelophehad was entitled.
The <i>baraita</i> continues. <b>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: They also took a portion</b> of <b>their father’s brother, as it is stated: “You shall give [<i>naton titten</i>].”</b> The double expression indicates that they received an additional portion. The Gemara notes: <b>And according to the one who says</b> that <b>they had two paternal uncles, that</b> additional portion <b>is derived from</b> the phrase: “You shall give them <b>a possession of an inheritance,”</b> which would be superfluous were it not to indicate an additional portion.
The Gemara presents the sixth question. <b>And Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> In <b>the verse</b> quoted above, <b>what</b> portions <b>is it counting? If</b> the verse <b>is counting children,</b> i.e., the portions of those who inherited from their antecedents, as with the daughters of Zelophehad, <b>there were many</b> such portions, and the verse did not enumerate all portions inherited by all members of the tribe. And <b>if</b> the verse <b>is counting fathers’ houses, there are</b> only <b>six,</b> as Hepher is included among the six enumerated in Joshua 17:2. Why, then, does the verse count the portions of the daughters of Zelophehad separately?

Daf 119a

The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the verse <b>is counting fathers’ houses. And</b> by also counting the inheritance of Zelophehad’s daughters, the verse <b>teaches us this: That</b> the <b>daughters of Zelophehad took</b> the <b>portion of the firstborn</b> due their father. <b>Evidently, Eretz Yisrael is</b> considered already <b>in possession</b> of one who was entitled to his portion of the land, even before the land was assigned. Although a firstborn son does not take a double portion of the property due to his deceased father as he does the property his father possessed, it is considered that Hepher possessed the portion that would eventually be assigned to him, and that Zelophehad was entitled to a double portion.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master says: And the sons</b> of the spies and of the protesters <b>took</b> portions of the land <b>in the merit of their paternal grandfathers and in the merit of their maternal grandfathers</b> if those grandfathers were among those who left Egypt. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:10): The sons of the spies and of the protesters took portions <b>in their own merit?</b> The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states they took portions in the merit of their grandfathers, is written <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who left Egypt;</b> and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i>, which states that they took portions in their own merit, is written <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of the <b>one who says</b> that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael.
The Gemara suggests another answer. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>This</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>and that</b> <i>baraita</i> are written in accordance with the opinion that asserts that Eretz Yisrael was divided <b>among those who entered Eretz</b> Yisrael, <b>and</b> it is <b>not difficult: This</b> <i>baraita</i> is discussing one <b>who was twenty</b> years <b>old</b> when the Jewish people entered Eretz Yisrael, and therefore he took a portion in his own merit, and <b>that</b> <i>baraita</i> is discussing one <b>who was not twenty</b> years <b>old.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And</b> Zelophehad took an additional portion that he received from Hepher, <b>because he was a firstborn,</b> and a firstborn <b>takes two portions</b> of inheritance from his father. The Gemara asks: <b>But why</b> was he entitled to the double portion of the firstborn? His portion of land <b>is</b> property merely <b>due</b> to Hepher, as Hepher never actually possessed the land, <b>and</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>a firstborn does not take</b> a double portion <b>of</b> property <b>due</b> to the deceased <b>as</b> he does <b>of</b> property the deceased <b>possessed. Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> This clause of the mishna is stated <b>with regard to tent pegs</b> and other assorted movable property that Hepher possessed.
<b>Rabba raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The <b>daughters of Zelophehad took four parts, as it is stated: “And ten parts fell to Manasseh”</b> (Joshua 17:5). Clearly, this is referring to portions of land, and not simply movable property. <b>Rather, Rabba says: Eretz Yisrael is</b> considered already <b>in possession</b> of one who was entitled to his portion of inheritance land, even before the land was assigned.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>. <b>Rabbi Ḥideka said: Shimon HaShikmoni was my colleague among the students of Rabbi Akiva, and so would Rabbi Shimon HaShikmoni say:</b> Even before turning to God for guidance, <b>Moses our teacher knew that the daughters of Zelophehad were inheritors</b> and that they were entitled to their father’s portion, as well as his share in Hepher’s portion. <b>But he did not know if they</b> were entitled to <b>take a portion of the firstborn</b> of Hepher’s portion <b>or not.</b>
Rabbi Ḥideka continues citing Rabbi Shimon HaShikmoni: <b>And</b> the Torah <b>portion</b> concerning the laws <b>of inheritances was fit to have been written through</b> God initiating a commandment to <b>Moses,</b> without mentioning Zelophehad’s daughters. <b>But</b> by demonstrating their desire for land in Eretz Yisrael the <b>daughters of Zelophehad merited</b> that the portion was <b>written through</b> a response to <b>them.</b>
Rabbi Ḥideka continues citing Rabbi Shimon HaShikmoni: <b>And Moses our teacher</b> similarly <b>knew that the</b> wood <b>gatherer,</b> who gathered wood on Shabbat (see Numbers 15:32–36), was to be punished <b>by death, as it is stated: “Every one that profanes it shall be put to death”</b> (Exodus 31:14), <b>but he did not know by which death</b> penalty the wood gatherer <b>must die. And the</b> Torah <b>portion</b> concerning the punishment <b>of</b> the wood <b>gatherer was fit to have been written through</b> God initiating a commandment to <b>Moses,</b> to teach which form of court-imposed capital punishment is administered to one who violates Shabbat. <b>But</b> the wood <b>gatherer was</b> found <b>guilty, and</b> the portion was <b>written through</b> the incident involving <b>him.</b> This is <b>to teach you</b>

Daf 119b

<b>that merit is brought about by means of</b> one who <b>is meritorious and liability by means of</b> one who <b>is liable.</b> Accordingly, the daughters of Zelophehad merited that the Torah portion concerning a positive matter be written through them, and the wood gatherer deserved that a portion concerning a negative matter be written through him. This concludes Rabbi Ḥideka’s citation of Rabbi Shimon HaShikmoni.
The Gemara states its objection: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that <b>Eretz Yisrael</b> was already <b>in possession</b> of the Jewish people even before the land was assigned, <b>what was</b> Moses <b>uncertain</b> about with regard to the right of Zelophehad’s daughters to collect a double portion; after all, Hepher’s portion in the land was in his possession, and Zelophehad was the firstborn?
The Gemara answers: <b>This</b> matter <b>itself</b> is what Moses <b>was uncertain</b> about, <b>as it is written: “And I will give it to you for a heritage [<i>morasha</i>]: I am the Lord”</b> (Exodus 6:8). Moses was unsure if the verse should be understood: <b>It</b> is <b>an inheritance [<i>yerusha</i>] for you from your fathers,</b> such that it is considered in the possession of those who left Egypt; <b>or perhaps</b> the verse indicates another matter, <b>that</b> the generation of those who left Egypt <b>bequeath [<i>morishin</i>]</b> the portions to others <b>but they do not inherit [<i>yoreshin</i>]</b> the portions themselves, because they are destined to die in the wilderness.
The Gemara continues: <b>And</b> God <b>resolved</b> the question <b>for him:</b> The verse teaches <b>both of them. It</b> is <b>an inheritance for you from your fathers</b> and is considered in your possession; <b>and</b> also the generation that left Egypt <b>bequeath but they do not inherit. And this is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written</b> in the song that the Jewish people sang after the splitting of the Red Sea: <b>“You will bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of Your inheritance”</b> (Exodus 15:17). It <b>is not stated: You will bring us in, rather: “You will bring them in,”</b> which <b>teaches that</b> in their song, the Jewish people <b>were prophesying</b> that their generation would never enter Eretz Yisrael, <b>but they did not know what they were prophesying.</b>
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the incident involving Zelophehad’s daughters. The verse states: <b>“And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation”</b> (Numbers 27:2). The Gemara asks: Is it <b>possible</b> that Zelophehad’s daughters <b>stood before Moses</b> and then Eleazar to ask their question, <b>and they said nothing to them; and</b> then the daughters <b>stood before the princes and all the congregation</b> to ask them? How would the princes or the congregation know an answer if Moses and Eleazar did not?
The Gemara answers: <b>Rather, transpose the verse and interpret it:</b> First, the daughters went to the congregation and ultimately came to Moses, this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yoshiya. Abba Ḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b> Those enumerated in the verse <b>were</b> all <b>sitting in the house of study, and</b> Zelophehad’s daughters <b>went and stood before all of them</b> at once. They were not asked separately; rather, the order of the verse reflects their stature.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>With regard to what do they disagree?</b> One <b>Sage,</b> Abba Ḥanan, <b>holds</b> that one may <b>show honor to a student in the presence of the teacher,</b> such that the verse would mention all the others even though they were in the presence of Moses; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yoshiya, <b>holds</b> one may <b>not show</b> honor to a student in the presence of the teacher, such that only Moses would have been mentioned if they were all in the same place.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that one may <b>show</b> honor to a student, <b>and the <i>halakha</i></b> is that one may <b>not show</b> honor. The Gemara asks: This is <b>difficult,</b> as there is a contradiction between <b>the</b> one <b><i>halakha</i> and the</b> other <b><i>halakha</i>.</b> The Gemara answers: The contradiction between <b>the</b> one <b><i>halakha</i> and the</b> other <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as <b>this</b> ruling, that one may show honor, was stated <b>where his teacher</b> himself <b>accords</b> the student <b>honor.</b> In such a case, others also may show the student honor. And <b>that</b> ruling, that one may not show honor, was stated <b>where his teacher does not accord him honor.</b>
§ The Sages <b>taught: The daughters of Zelophehad are wise, they are interpreters</b> of verses, and <b>they are righteous.</b>
The Gemara proves these assertions. That <b>they are wise</b> can be seen from the fact <b>that they spoke in accordance with the moment,</b> i.e., they presented their case at an auspicious time. <b>As Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says:</b> Tradition <b>teaches that Moses our teacher was sitting and interpreting in</b> the Torah <b>portion about men whose married brothers had died childless, as it is stated: “If brothers dwell together,</b> and one of them dies, and has no child, the wife of the dead shall not be married abroad to one not of his kin; her husband’s brother shall come to her, and take her for him as a wife” (Deuteronomy 25:5). The daughters of Zelophehad <b>said to</b> Moses: <b>If we are</b> each <b>considered like a son, give us</b> each <b>an inheritance like a son;</b> and <b>if not, our mother should enter into levirate marriage. Immediately</b> upon hearing their claim, the verse records: <b>“And Moses brought their cause before the Lord”</b> (Numbers 27:5).
That <b>they are interpreters</b> of verses can be seen from the fact <b>that they were saying: If</b> our father <b>had had a son, we would not have spoken;</b> but because he had no son, we are filling the role of the heir. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: They would say, if he had had <b>a daughter,</b> we would not have spoken? <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said: Delete from</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>here</b> the word: <b>Daughter.</b> As they were themselves daughters, this cannot have been their claim. <b>Abaye said</b> that the <i>baraita</i> need not be emended, and should be understood as follows: <b>Even if</b> there <b>was a daughter of a son</b> of Zelophehad, <b>we would not have spoken,</b> for she would have been the heir.
That <b>they are righteous</b> can be seen from the fact <b>that they</b> did <b>not</b> rush to <b>marry,</b> but <b>rather</b> waited <b>to</b> marry those <b>fit for them. Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov teaches: Even the youngest</b> to be married <b>among them was not married</b> at <b>less than forty years</b> of age.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rav Ḥisda say:</b> If a woman <b>marries</b> when she is <b>less than twenty</b> years <b>old,</b> she is able to <b>give birth until</b> she reaches the age of <b>sixty;</b> if she marries when she is <b>twenty</b> years <b>old</b> or older, she is able to <b>give birth until</b> she reaches the age of <b>forty;</b> if she marries when she is <b>forty</b> years <b>old</b> or older, she is <b>no longer</b> able to <b>give birth</b> at all. If so, how could Zelophehad’s daughters have waited until the age of forty to marry? <b>Rather, since they are righteous women, a miracle was performed for them, like</b> the one done for <b>Jochebed. As it is written: “And a man of the house of Levi went, and took as a wife a daughter of Levi”</b> (Exodus 2:1).

Daf 120a

The Gemara asks: Is it <b>possible</b> that this is Jochebed? Jochebed was then <b>130 years old and</b> the verse <b>called her a daughter,</b> indicating one who is very young. Jochebed’s age is established based on a tradition concerning the number of Jacob’s descendants who came to Egypt, as follows: While the verse states that Leah had thirty-three descendants (Genesis 46:15), only thirty-two were enumerated. This was explained <b>as Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina says: This</b> “daughter of Levi” is <b>Jochebed, whose conception</b> occurred <b>on the journey</b> as the family of Jacob descended to Egypt, <b>and she was born within the walls,</b> i.e., having entered Egypt, <b>as it is written:</b> “And the name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, <b>who was born to Levi in Egypt”</b> (Numbers 26:59).
One can infer from the verse: <b>Her birth</b> was <b>in Egypt, but her conception was not in Egypt.</b> Since the Jewish people were in Egypt for 210 years and Moses was eighty years old at the time of the Exodus, Jochebed must have been 130 years old when Moses was born. The Gemara therefore asks: <b>And why</b> does the verse <b>call her “a daughter”? Rav Yehuda bar Zevida says:</b> This <b>teaches that</b> her <b>signs of youth</b> miraculously <b>came into being</b> again. <b>The flesh became smooth, the wrinkles were straightened out, and the</b> youthful <b>beauty returned to its place.</b>
The verse concerning Amram’s marriage to Jochebed states: “And a man of the house of Levi went, <b>and took</b> as a wife a daughter of Levi” (Exodus 2:1). The Gemara asks: Since Jochebed had already been married to Amram for some years, as Miriam and Aaron were already born, the verse <b>should have</b> stated: <b>And</b> he <b>took back</b> as a wife. <b>Rav Yehuda bar Zevida says:</b> The wording of the verse <b>teaches that</b> Amram <b>performed for her</b> a formal <b>act of marriage</b> as though he were marrying her for the first time. He <b>seated her in</b> a bridal <b>palanquin [<i>be’appiryon</i>], and Aaron and Miriam</b> were <b>singing before her, and</b> the <b>ministering angels</b> were <b>saying: “A joyful mother of children”</b> (Psalms 113:9).
§ The Gemara returns to discuss Zelophehad’s daughters: <b>Later on, the verse lists them according to their age,</b> stating: “For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married” (Numbers 36:11), <b>and here</b> the verse lists them in a different order, <b>according to their wisdom:</b> “And these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah” (Numbers 27:1). This <b>supports</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Ami, as Rabbi Ami says: In</b> the context of <b>sitting</b> in judgment or learning Torah, <b>follow</b> the participants’ <b>wisdom</b> in determining the seating, so that the wisest is granted the highest honor, and <b>in</b> the context of <b>reclining</b> for a meal, <b>follow</b> the participants’ <b>age. Rav Ashi says: And this</b> is so only <b>when</b> one is <b>outstanding in wisdom,</b> then wisdom trumps age; <b>and this</b> is so only <b>when</b> one of the participants is <b>outstanding in age,</b> i.e., particularly old, then age trumps wisdom.
The Gemara cites an alternative opinion: <b>The school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: The daughters of Zelophehad were equal</b> in stature, <b>as it is stated:</b> “For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, <b>were [<i>vatihyena</i>]</b> married.” The word “<i>vatihyena</i>” demonstrates: <b>There was one</b> uniform <b>existence [<i>havaya</i>],</b> i.e., spiritual level, <b>for all of them.</b>
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: The daughters of Zelophehad were permitted to marry</b> members <b>of any of the tribes, as it is stated: “Let them be married to whom they think best”</b> (Numbers 36:6). <b>But how do I realize</b> the meaning of the continuation of the same verse: <b>“Only into the family of the tribe of their father shall they be married”</b> (Numbers 36:6), according to which they were permitted to marry only members of their own tribe? <b>The verse offered them good advice, that they should be married only</b> to those <b>fit for them,</b> who were often men from within the family.
<b>Rabba raised an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> taught concerning the prohibition against eating consecrated foods while in a state of ritual impurity. Moses was commanded: “Say to them: Whoever will be of all your descendants throughout your generations, who approaches to the holy things, which the children of Israel consecrate to the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before Me” (Leviticus 22:3). Which people are referred to in the phrase <b>“say to them”?</b> It is referring <b>to those standing at Mount Sinai.</b> Which people are referred to in the phrase <b>“throughout your generations”? These are the coming generations. If</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is stated</b> to <b>the fathers, why is</b> it <b>stated</b> to <b>the sons; and if</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>is stated</b> to <b>the sons, why is</b> it <b>stated</b> to <b>the fathers?</b> This is <b>because there are</b> mitzvot <b>for the fathers that are not for the sons, and there are</b> mitzvot <b>for the sons that are not for the fathers.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>For the fathers,</b> the verse <b>states: “And every daughter who possesses an inheritance</b> from the tribes of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father” (Numbers 36:8). This mitzva, that the woman should marry a member of her own tribe, applied only to the first generation that received tribal portions of Eretz Yisrael. <b>And,</b> by contrast, there were <b>many mitzvot,</b> e.g., all the mitzvot that applied only from the time that Eretz Yisrael was settled, which <b>the sons were commanded</b> to fulfill but <b>which the fathers were not commanded</b> to fulfill. <b>Because there are</b> mitzvot <b>for the fathers that are not for the sons, and there are</b> mitzvot <b>for the sons that are not for the fathers,</b> the verse <b>needed to state,</b> i.e., to address, the <b>fathers,</b> and it <b>needed to state,</b> i.e., to address, the <b>sons.</b>
Rabba states his objection: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: For the fathers,</b> the verse <b>states: “And every daughter who possesses an inheritance</b> from the tribes of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father.” This indicates that this was a mitzva for that entire generation, including Zelophehad’s daughters, in contrast to the statement of Shmuel. The Gemara explains: <b>He,</b> Rabba, <b>raised the objection, and he resolved it:</b> This mitzva applied to everyone <b>except for the daughters of Zelophehad,</b> who were explicitly permitted to marry members of any tribe.
<b>The Master says</b> in the <i>baraita</i> cited above: <b>For the fathers,</b> the verse <b>states: “And every daughter who possesses an inheritance</b> from the tribes of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father.” <b>For the fathers, yes,</b> this is the mitzva, but <b>for the sons,</b> it is <b>not</b> so. The Gemara asks: <b>From where may</b> it <b>be inferred? Rava said</b> that <b>the verse states</b> there: <b>“This is the matter</b> that the Lord has commanded” (Numbers 36:6), meaning: <b>This matter will not be practiced except in this generation.</b>
<b>Rabba Zuti said to Rav Ashi: If that is so,</b> then concerning the phrase <b>“this is the matter”</b> written <b>with regard to</b> an offering <b>slaughtered outside</b> the Tabernacle (see Leviticus 17:2–3), <b>so too,</b> is it the <i>halakha</i> <b>that it will not be practiced except in this generation?</b> Certainly that is not so, as that prohibition applies in all generations. What is the difference between the two passages? Rav Ashi answered: It <b>is different there,</b> with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple, <b>as it is written: “Throughout their generations”</b> (Leviticus 17:7), indicating that the prohibition is in effect in all generations.

Daf 120b

Rabba Zuti asked Rav Ashi about another instance of the same phrase. In the case of <b>“this is the matter”</b> written <b>with regard to</b> the <b>heads of the tribes,</b> in the introductory verse to the <i>halakhot</i> of vows: “And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying: This is the matter that the Lord has commanded” (Numbers 30:2), is it <b>also</b> the case <b>that</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of vows <b>will not be practiced except in this generation?</b> Rav Ashi <b>said to him:</b> The <i>halakha</i> in <b>that</b> case, that of vows, <b>is derived through</b> a verbal analogy between the word <b>“this”</b> stated here, in the verse discussing vows, and the word <b>“this”</b> stated <b>there,</b> in the verse discussing offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple, which is applicable in all generations.
The Gemara asks: <b>This</b> <i>halakha</i>, concerning the daughter inheriting her father’s portion, <b>let it be derived through</b> a verbal analogy between the word <b>“this”</b> stated here, with regard to inheritance, and the word <b>“this”</b> stated <b>there,</b> in the verse discussing offerings, <b>as well.</b> The Gemara rejects that comparison: <b>What is this</b> suggestion? <b>Granted, there,</b> i.e., with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple and with regard to vows, the phrase “this is the matter” <b>was necessary</b> for deriving other <i>halakhot</i> through <b>a verbal analogy,</b> as will be explained later. Therefore, the term may also be employed to teach that the <i>halakha</i> applies in all generations. But <b>here,</b> with regard to a daughter’s inheritance, <b>for what</b> other <i>halakha</i> <b>was</b> this phrase <b>necessary?</b> If the <i>halakha</i> truly applies for posterity, <b>let the verse be silent</b> and refrain <b>from</b> addressing when this <i>halakha</i> applies by not stating “this is the matter,” <b>and I</b> would <b>know that it is for all generations,</b> as is the case with all other mitzvot.
The Gemara explains: <b>What</b> is the <b>verbal analogy</b> for which the phrase was necessary? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>It is stated here,</b> with regard to vows: <b>“This is the matter,” and it is stated there,</b> with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple: <b>“This is the matter.” Just as there</b> the mitzva applies to <b>Aaron and his sons and all Israel, so too here,</b> with regard to vows, the mitzva applies to <b>Aaron and his sons and all Israel. And just as here</b> the mitzva applies to <b>the heads of the tribes,</b> as explicitly stated in the verse cited above, <b>so too there,</b> with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple, there is particular relevance to <b>the heads of the tribes.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the cited <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master says: Just as there,</b> with regard to offerings, the mitzva applies to <b>Aaron and his sons and all Israel, so too here,</b> with regard to vows, the mitzva applies to <b>Aaron and his sons and all Israel.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this verbal analogy stated? <b>Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov says:</b> This is written <b>to say that</b> the <b>dissolution of vows</b> can be performed <b>by three laymen</b> with no particular expertise in the <i>halakhot</i> of vows, just as the prohibition of offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple applies to all of the Jewish people, including laymen.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the phrase <b>“the heads of the tribes” is written</b> explicitly <b>in</b> the portion of the vows, indicating that the matter is not entrusted to laymen. The Gemara answers: It is <b>as Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> in a different context: The mention of the heads of tribes teaches that vows may be dissolved <b>by a single expert</b> halakhic authority; <b>so too</b> here, this phrase teaches that vows can be nullified <b>by a single expert</b> halakhic authority.
The Gemara analyzes the next clause of the cited <i>baraita</i>: <b>And just as here</b> the mitzva applies to <b>the heads of the tribes, so too there,</b> with regard to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple, there is particular relevance to <b>the heads of the tribes.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> are the heads of the tribes linked to the prohibition of slaughtering offerings outside the Tabernacle or Temple? <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> This is written <b>to say</b> that <b>there is</b> a concept of <b>requesting</b> dissolution of consecration <b>of consecrated</b> property, just as one can request dissolution of a vow.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Beit Shammai, who say</b> that <b>there is no</b> possibility of <b>requesting</b> that a halakhic authority dissolve a vow <b>of consecrated</b> property, this cannot explain the connection of the heads of the tribes to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nazir</i> 30b): <b>Beit Shammai say: Consecration</b> that one performed <b>in error is</b> nevertheless effective as <b>consecration,</b> because one’s mindset does not supersede his verbal declaration; <b>and Beit Hillel say:</b> This is <b>not consecration.</b> Accordingly, in the opinion of Beit Shammai, <b>what do they do with this</b> seemingly analogous usage of <b>“this” and “this,”</b> in the portions of offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple and vows, respectively?
The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai <b>require “this is the matter”</b> written <b>of offerings slaughtered outside</b> the Tabernacle or Temple to teach that <b>for the</b> act of <b>slaughtering, he is liable</b> to receive excision from the World-to-Come [<i>karet</i>]; <b>but he is not liable</b> to receive <i>karet</i> <b>for the</b> act of <b>pinching</b> the neck of a consecrated bird outside the Tabernacle or Temple, which is excluded from the category of slaughtering in this mitzva. And Beit Shammai <b>require “this is the matter”</b> written of <b>the heads of the tribes</b> in the portion about vows <b>to</b> teach that only <b>a halakhic authority can dissolve</b> vows, <b>but a husband cannot dissolve</b> them. The halakhic authority can dissolve the vow for a petitioner, but a woman’s husband or father cannot dissolve her vow. And, conversely, <b>a husband can nullify</b> his wife’s or his daughter’s vows on the day that he hears the vow, regardless of her mindset, <b>but a halakhic authority cannot nullify</b> vows in this manner.
The Gemara asks: <b>But according to Beit Shammai, who do not have</b> this <b>verbal analogy,</b> meaning that they do not recognize as authoritative the verbal analogy that links vows to offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple, <b>from where do they</b> derive that <b>dissolution of vows</b> can be performed <b>by three laymen?</b> The Gemara answers: Beit Shammai <b>derive it from that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The verse states at the end of a passage relating to the <i>halakhot</i> of the Festivals: <b>“And Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the Lord”</b> (Leviticus 23:44). In explaining the verse, <b>Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says:</b>

Daf 121a

<b>The Festivals of the Lord were stated,</b> but <b>Shabbat,</b> which commemorates <b>Creation, was not stated. Ben Azzai says: The Festivals of the Lord were stated,</b> but <b>the dissolution of vows was not stated.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara recounts: <b>Rabbi Yosei bar Natan learned this <i>baraita</i> and did not know how to explain it.</b> He <b>followed Rav Sheshet to Neharde’a</b> in order to ask him about it, <b>but</b> he <b>did not find him</b> there. He <b>followed him to Meḥoza</b> and <b>found him,</b> and he <b>said to him: What</b> is meant by Rabbi Yosei HaGelili’s statement: <b>The Festivals of the Lord were stated,</b> but <b>Shabbat,</b> which commemorates <b>Creation, was not stated?</b> What does he mean, as Shabbat of Creation is explicitly mentioned in that section of the Torah (Leviticus 23:3)?
Rav Sheshet <b>said to him: The Festivals of the Lord require sanctification by the court.</b> This means that the start of the month, which is dependent upon the appearance of the New Moon, which determines the Festivals, can be established only by a court composed of experts. <b>Shabbat,</b> which commemorates <b>Creation, does not require sanctification by the court.</b> Shabbat is sanctified every week independent of any court action. It may <b>enter your mind to say: Since</b> Shabbat <b>is written adjacent to the Festivals, it should require sanctification by the court as</b> do the <b>Festivals.</b> Rabbi Yosei HaGelili <b>teaches us</b> that Shabbat does not require this.
Rabbi Yosei bar Natan asked: <b>What</b> is meant by ben Azzai’s statement: <b>The Festivals of the Lord were stated,</b> but <b>the dissolution of vows was not stated?</b> After all, the Torah writes explicitly about the dissolution of vows. Rav Sheshet answered him: <b>The Festivals of the Lord require experts</b> to determine when the months begin and when the Festivals will be observed, but <b>the dissolution of vows does not require experts.</b>
The Gemara questions this explanation. <b>But it is written: “The heads of the tribes”</b> (Numbers 30:2), in the portion discussing the <i>halakhot</i> of vows. How, then, can it be said that vows can be dissolved by laymen? <b>Rav Ḥisda says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The phrase teaches that vows can be dissolved <b>by a single expert</b> authority. In any event, the Gemara has established that Beit Shammai can derive that dissolution of vows can be performed by laymen in the manner stated by ben Azzai, as explained by Rav Sheshet.
§ The Gemara discusses a mishna that addresses the issue of inter-tribal marriages. <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Ta’anit</i> 26b): <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: There were no days as joyous for the Jewish people as the fifteenth of Av and as Yom Kippur, as on these</b> days <b>the daughters of Jerusalem would emerge in white garments,</b> which each woman <b>borrowed</b> from another. Why did they borrow garments? They did this <b>so as not to embarrass one who did not have</b> her own white garments. The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <b>Granted</b> that <b>Yom Kippur</b> is a day of joy, because it is <b>a day of pardon and forgiveness,</b> and moreover, it is the <b>day on which the last Tablets</b> of the Covenant <b>were given. But what is</b> the special joy of the <b>fifteenth of Av?</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> This was the <b>day when</b> the members of different <b>tribes were permitted to marry</b> into <b>one another’s</b> tribe. Such marriages were restricted for the first generation to enter Eretz Yisrael, as discussed above (120a). <b>What</b> verse <b>did</b> the sages of that time <b>interpret</b> in support of their conclusion that this <i>halakha</i> was no longer in effect? The verse states: <b>“This is the matter”</b> (Numbers 36:6), meaning, <b>this matter shall be practiced only in this generation,</b> in which Eretz Yisrael is being divided among the tribes.
<b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> offered another explanation: The fifteenth of Av was the <b>day when</b> the <b>tribe of Benjamin was permitted to enter into the congregation</b> of the other tribes of Israel through marriage, after the other tribes found a way to dissolve the vow that had prohibited them from marrying a member of the tribe of Benjamin in the aftermath of the episode of the concubine in Gibeah (Judges, chapters 19–20). <b>As it is written: “And the men of Israel had taken an oath in Mizpah, saying: None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife”</b> (Judges 21:1). The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> verse <b>did</b> the sages of that time <b>interpret</b> that enabled them to dissolve this vow? The verse states: “None <b>of us,” and not:</b> None <b>of our children;</b> therefore, the oath applied only to the generation that had taken the oath.
<b>Rav Dimi bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman</b> says: The fifteenth of Av was the <b>day on which those designated to perish in the wilderness stopped</b> dying, as the entire generation that had left Egypt had died due to the sin of the spies (Numbers 14:29–30). <b>As the Master says: As long as those designated to perish</b> in the <b>wilderness had not stopped</b> dying,

Daf 121b

God <b>did not speak with Moses, as it is stated: “So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:16), <b>and juxtaposed to</b> that verse it is written: <b>“That the Lord spoke to me, saying”</b> (Deuteronomy 2:17). Moses indicates: Only after the last of that generation had died, <b>was the speech</b> of God directed <b>to me.</b> When the Jewish people realized that the decree had been lifted, the day was established as a permanent day of rejoicing.
The Gemara continues to cite explanations for the significance of the fifteenth of Av. <b>Ulla says:</b> The fifteenth of Av was the <b>day when</b> King <b>Hoshea, son of Ela, removed</b> the <b>guards [<i>pardesaot</i>] that Jeroboam,</b> son of Nevat, <b>placed on the roads so that Israel</b> would <b>not ascend</b> to Jerusalem <b>for the pilgrimage Festival.</b> By doing so, King Hoshea renewed the access to Jerusalem for pilgrims.
<b>Rav Mattana says:</b> The fifteenth of Av was the <b>day when the slain</b> victims <b>of Beitar were afforded burial,</b> several years after they were killed and the Roman emperor Hadrian decreed that they were not to be buried (see <i>Gittin</i> 57a). <b>As Rav Mattana says:</b> On <b>the day that the slain of Beitar were afforded burial,</b> the Sages <b>in Yavne instituted</b> the blessing: Blessed is He <b>Who is good and Who does good.</b> The term: <b>Who is good,</b> is to give thanks <b>that</b> the corpses <b>did not decompose</b> despite the long delay; and the term: <b>And Who does good,</b> is to give thanks <b>that</b> the slain ones <b>were</b> ultimately <b>afforded burial.</b>
<b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both say:</b> The fifteenth of Av is the <b>day when they stop cutting wood for the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar. It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer the Great says: Once the fifteenth of Av came, the force of the sun would weaken, and</b> from this date <b>they would not cut</b> additional <b>wood for the arrangement,</b> because wood cut from then on would not dry properly and would be unfit for use in the Temple. <b>Rav Menashe said: And</b> the people <b>called</b> the fifteenth of Av: The <b>day of the breaking of the sickle [<i>maggal</i> ],</b> as they did not need the lumbering tools until the following year.
The Gemara adds: <b>From this</b> point <b>forward,</b> when the nights lengthen, <b>one who adds [<i>demosif</i> ]</b> to his nightly Torah study <b>will add [<i>yosif</i> ]</b> to his life, <b>and he who does not add,</b> that person is <b><i>yesif</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the term <b><i>yesif</i> ? Rav Yosef teaches:</b> It means that <b>his mother will bury him,</b> as he will die during his mother’s lifetime.
§ After discussing the generation of those who died in the wilderness, the Gemara mentions a tradition that relates to that generation. <b>The Sages taught: Seven</b> people <b>spanned</b> in their lifetimes <b>the whole world in its entirety,</b> i.e., their lives have spanned all of human history. <b>Methuselah saw Adam</b> in his lifetime; <b>Shem saw Methuselah; Jacob saw Shem; Amram saw Jacob; Ahijah the Shilonite saw Amram; Elijah saw Ahijah the Shilonite; and</b> Elijah <b>is still alive.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it true that <b>Ahijah the Shilonite saw Amram? But it is written: “And no man among them remained, save Caleb, son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, son of Nun”</b> (Numbers 26:65). Since Amram died well before the Jewish people left Egypt, in order to have lived at the time of Amram, Ahijah would have had to be an adult at the time of the Exodus. How, then, could he have lived through the generation of those who died in the wilderness?
<b>Rav Hamnuna says:</b> The <b>decree</b> of death pronounced for the generation of the spies <b>was not decreed upon the tribe of Levi, as it is written: “Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness, and all those who were counted among you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward”</b> (Numbers 14:29). The verse is interpreted: The decree applies to <b>one whose count</b> in the census <b>is from the age of twenty</b> and up, <b>excluding the tribe of Levi, whose count is from the age of thirty</b> and up. Ahijah was a Levite, and he was not subject to the decree.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it true that <b>no</b> one <b>from the other tribes entered</b> Eretz Yisrael? <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Yair, son of Manasseh, and Machir, son of Manasseh, were born in the days of Jacob, and they did not die until the Jewish people entered Eretz Yisrael, as it is stated: “And the men of Ai killed of them about thirty-six men”</b> (Joshua 7:5). <b>And</b> concerning this verse, <b>it is taught: Literally thirty-six</b> people were killed, this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
<b>Rabbi Neḥemya said to him: But is it stated</b> that <b>thirty-six</b> were killed? <b>Isn’t it stated nothing other than: “About thirty-six”</b> were killed? <b>Rather, this</b> unusual term is referring to <b>Yair, son of Manasseh, who</b> was <b>equivalent to the majority of the Sanhedrin,</b> whose maximum number of judges is seventy-one, of which thirty-six is a slight majority. Evidently, then, Yair, son of Manasseh also survived the time in the wilderness.
<b>Rather, Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said:</b> The <b>decree</b> of death <b>was not decreed either upon</b> those <b>less than twenty</b> years <b>old or upon</b> those <b>more than sixty</b> years <b>old</b> at the time of the sin of the spies. The Gemara explains: <b>Not upon</b> those <b>less than twenty</b> years <b>old, as it is written: “From twenty years old and upward”</b> (Numbers 14:29). <b>And not upon</b> those <b>more than sixty</b> years <b>old,</b> because he <b>learns</b> that there is a verbal analogy between <b>“and upward”</b> in the verse cited, and <b>“and upward” from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>valuations,</b> in the phrase: “From sixty years old and upward” (Leviticus 27:7). <b>Just as there,</b> concerning valuations, <b>more than sixty</b> years <b>old is comparable to less than twenty</b> years <b>old,</b> as there is a distinct category of those between the ages of twenty and sixty, <b>so too here, more than sixty</b> years <b>old is comparable to less than twenty</b> years <b>old</b> insofar as those older were not subject to the sentence. Yair, son of Manasseh, who was already older, did not die in the wilderness.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Was <b>Eretz Yisrael divided according to</b> the <b>tribes,</b> meaning that each of the twelve tribes received an equal portion, and the members of each tribe divided these tribal portions according to their numbers; <b>or perhaps</b> Eretz Yisrael was <b>divided according to men’s skulls,</b> meaning that a certain area of land was given to each individual, and the size of the tribal allotments was a function of the tribe’s population?

Daf 122a

The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof. The verse states: “According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided <b>between the more and the fewer”</b> (Numbers 26:56). Evidently, whether the tribe had many or few people, the tribe as a whole received a portion equal to that of every other tribe, and each individual within the tribe received a different amount of land than those in other tribes.
<b>And</b> another proof can be seen from that which <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Eretz Yisrael is destined to be divided among thirteen tribes</b> during the messianic era, unlike the division in the time of Joshua. <b>As, initially</b> the land was <b>divided only among twelve tribes,</b> as the Torah does not allot a portion to the tribe of Levi. The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> the land was <b>divided only with money,</b> such that each tribe that received a portion more valuable than average compensated another tribe that had received a portion less valuable than average, <b>as it is stated: “Between the more and the fewer.” Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> The area of land whose yield is <b>a <i>se’a</i></b> of grain <b>in Judea</b> is so valuable that it is <b>equal</b> in value to the area necessary to produce <b>five <i>se’a</i></b> of grain <b>in the Galilee.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> the land was <b>divided only by a lottery, as it is stated: “Only by lot</b> shall the land be divided” (Numbers 26:55). <b>And</b> the land was <b>divided only with</b> the <b><i>Urim VeTummim</i>, as it is stated: “By the pronouncement of the lot”</b> (Numbers 26:56).
The <i>baraita</i> asks: <b>How</b> can <b>these</b> texts be reconciled? One indicates that the land was divided by lottery and the other indicates that the land was divided with the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>. The <i>baraita</i> explains: <b>Elazar</b> the High Priest was <b>dressed</b> with the <b><i>Urim VeTummim</i>, and Joshua and all the Jewish people</b> were <b>standing before him, and</b> a lottery <b>receptacle</b> containing the names <b>of</b> the <b>tribes and</b> another lottery <b>receptacle</b> containing the names <b>of</b> the <b>boundaries</b> of the twelve different regions of Eretz Yisrael were <b>placed before him.</b>
<b>And</b> Elazar <b>would ascertain</b> the assignments of land <b>with the Divine Spirit and say,</b> in accordance with the notification of the <i>Urim VeTummim</i>: The name of the tribe <b>Zebulun</b> now <b>emerges</b> from the receptacle in the lottery, and the region whose <b>boundary</b> is <b>Akko emerges with it</b> from the other receptacle. After stating this, he would <b>mix</b> the lots <b>in the receptacle of the tribes and</b> the lot of <b>Zebulun</b> would <b>emerge in his hand.</b> He would then <b>mix</b> the lots <b>in the receptacle of the boundaries, and</b> the <b>boundary</b> of <b>Akko</b> would <b>emerge in his hand.</b>
<b>And</b> Elazar <b>would repeat</b> the process <b>and ascertain</b> the assignments <b>with the Divine Spirit and say:</b> The name of the tribe <b>Naftali</b> now <b>emerges, and</b> the region whose <b>boundary</b> is <b>Ginnosar emerges with it</b> from the other receptacle. After stating this, he would <b>mix</b> the lots <b>in the receptacle of the tribes and</b> the lot of <b>Naftali</b> would <b>emerge in his hand.</b> He would then <b>mix</b> the lots <b>in the receptacle of the boundaries, and</b> the <b>boundary</b> of <b>Ginnosar</b> would <b>emerge in his hand. And so</b> he would proceed for <b>each and every tribe.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And unlike the division in this world,</b> i.e., in the time of Joshua, will be the <b>division</b> of portions <b>in the World-to-Come,</b> i.e., in the messianic era. In <b>this world,</b> if <b>a person has a field of grain, he does not have a field</b> for <b>an orchard;</b> if he has <b>a field</b> for <b>an orchard, he does not have a field of grain.</b> This is so because each climate and variety of soil is suitable for a different type of produce. But <b>in the World-to-Come, you do not have any person who does not have</b> a portion in Eretz Yisrael <b>in the mountain, and in the lowland, and in the valley, as it is stated: “The gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one”</b> (Ezekiel 48:31), which is to say that everyone’s portion will be the same. And <b>the Holy One, Blessed be He, will distribute it to them personally, as it is stated: “And these are their portions, says the Lord”</b> (Ezekiel 48:29). This is the conclusion of the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara states its proof: <b>In any event,</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches: As initially,</b> the land was <b>divided only among</b> the <b>twelve tribes. Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that the land <b>was divided according to</b> the <b>tribes,</b> and not apportioned directly to each person. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that this is the case.
§ The Gemara returns to analyze the <i>baraita</i> just cited. <b>The Master says</b> above: <b>Eretz Yisrael is destined to be divided among thirteen tribes.</b> The Gemara asks: As to <b>the other,</b> thirteenth portion, <b>for whom</b> is it? <b>Rav Ḥisda said: For the king, as it is written: “And they that serve the city, out of all the tribes of Israel, shall till it”</b> (Ezekiel 48:19). The verse is understood as meaning that the nation will collectively allot a portion to the king, who serves the needs of the nation. <b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> Why is the verse interpreted in this way? <b>Say</b> that the verse speaks of <b>mere wages [<i>rongar</i>],</b> so that the king has rights to collect taxes, but not an actual portion of land. The Gemara answers: That possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as it is written: “And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the sacred offering and of the possession of the city”</b> (Ezekiel 48:21). Based on this latter verse, the former verse speaks of a specific tract of land.
The <i>baraita</i> also states: <b>And</b> the land was <b>divided only with money, as it is stated: “Between the more and the fewer.” With regard to what</b> is this said? <b>If we say</b> it is with regard <b>to beauty and ugliness,</b> i.e., that those who receive inferior-quality land received monetary compensation from the others, <b>is that to say we are dealing with fools [<i>beshufetanei</i>]</b> who would agree to take inferior-quality land in exchange for more money? <b>Rather,</b> it is said <b>with regard to</b> the difference between land that is <b>close</b> to Jerusalem <b>and</b> land that is <b>far</b> from Jerusalem. Those whose property was close to Jerusalem compensated those whose property was farther away.
The Gemara notes: There <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i></b> with regard to the manner by which this compensation was given: <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> The tribes <b>compensated</b> each other <b>with money. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The tribes <b>compensated</b> each other <b>with land</b> by giving extra land to those whose portions were in less advantageous locations.
The <i>baraita</i> also states: <b>And</b> the land was <b>divided only by a lottery, as it is stated: “Only by lot</b> shall the land be divided” (Numbers 26:55). The Sages <b>taught:</b> In the phrase <b>“only by lot,”</b> the term “only” indicates that <b>Joshua and Caleb</b> are <b>excluded</b> from this proviso. The Gemara asks: With regard <b>to what</b> were they excluded? <b>If we say that</b> they did <b>not take</b> portions <b>at all, now</b> that it has already been taught that they <b>took</b> the portions of the spies (118b) <b>that</b> were <b>not their</b> own, <b>is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to teach that they took <b>their own</b> portions? It goes without saying that they did collect their portions. <b>Rather,</b> the exclusion teaches <b>that</b> they <b>did not take</b> portions <b>by a lottery but according to</b> explicit designation by <b>the Lord.</b> With regard to <b>Joshua,</b> this is <b>as it is written: “According to the commandment of the Lord they gave him the city that he asked, even Timnath Serah in the hill-country of Ephraim”</b> (Joshua 19:50).

Daf 122b

The Gemara interjects: <b>It is written</b> concerning Joshua’s burial: “And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath <b>Serah”</b> (Joshua 24:30), <b>and it is written:</b> “And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath <b>Heres”</b> (Judges 2:9). Why is the name changed? <b>Rabbi Elazar says: Initially, its fruits</b> were as dry <b>as clay [<i>keḥeres</i>], and ultimately, its fruits</b> were so plump that they were <b>spoiling [<i>masriḥin</i>]. And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> the opposite: <b>Initially,</b> the fruits were <b>spoiling</b> prematurely, <b>and ultimately,</b> they lasted as long <b>as clay</b> without spoiling.
<b>Caleb</b> also received his portion directly from God and not through the lottery, <b>as it is written: “And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken; and he drove out from there the three sons of the giant”</b> (Judges 1:20). The Gemara asks about this verse: But <b>Hebron was a city of refuge</b> that belonged to the priests, as described in the book of Joshua (21:13); how could it have been given to Caleb? <b>Abaye said: Its outskirts [<i>parvaraha</i>],</b> i.e., only the fields and vineyards lying beyond the city limits, were given to Caleb. <b>As it is written: “But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession”</b> (Joshua 21:12).
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Both the son and the daughter</b> of the deceased are included <b>in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>inheritance. But</b> the difference is <b>that the</b> firstborn <b>son takes a double</b> portion <b>of the property of the father, and he does not take a double</b> portion <b>of the property of the mother. And</b> another difference is that <b>the daughters are sustained from the property of the father</b> after he dies, as it is a mandatory condition of their mother’s marriage contract that they are to be sustained even before the estate is disbursed to the children, <b>but the</b> daughters <b>are not sustained from the property of the mother,</b> which is all inherited by the sons.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara analyzes the mishna: <b>What</b> is meant by the first clause of the mishna: <b>Both the son and the daughter</b> of the deceased are included <b>in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>inheritance? If we say that</b> they <b>inherit together, didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (115a): <b>A son precedes a daughter?</b> Additionally, <b>all descendants of a son precede a daughter.</b> It is clear that a daughter does not inherit together with a son.
<b><i>Nafsham</i></b> is <b>a mnemonic</b> for the names of the Sages cited in the following discussion: Naḥman; Pappa; Ashi; Mar. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Both the son and the daughter take in</b> inheritance the property <b>due</b> to their father <b>as</b> they would take <b>in</b> inheritance the property that he had <b>in</b> his <b>possession.</b>
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>We</b> already <b>learn</b> this <b>as well</b> in a mishna (116b): <b>Zelophehad’s daughters took three portions</b> of land <b>in</b> the <b>inheritance</b> of Eretz Yisrael: <b>Their father’s portion</b> that he received <b>because he was among those who left Egypt; and his portion</b> that he received <b>with his brothers in</b> the <b>property of Hepher,</b> their father, although Zelophehad predeceased his father and never was in possession of the inheritance from Hepher; and an additional portion that he received from Hepher because he was a firstborn. It is already taught in that mishna that property due to the deceased is inherited in the same manner as property possessed by the deceased.
<b>And furthermore,</b> if the explanation of the mishna is as stated by Rav Naḥman, <b>what</b> is meant by the phrase: <b>But</b> the difference is that the firstborn son takes a double portion of the property of the father, and he does not take a double portion of the property of the mother? According to Rav Naḥman’s explanation, what is the contrast between the two clauses in the mishna?
<b>Rather, Rav Pappa said: This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Both the son and the daughter</b> of the deceased <b>take a portion of the firstborn.</b>
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>We</b> already <b>learn</b> this in a mishna <b>as well</b> (116b), which explains the third portion taken by the daughters of Zelophehad: <b>And</b> they took an additional portion that he received from Hepher, <b>as he was a firstborn,</b> and a firstborn <b>takes two portions</b> of inheritance from his father. <b>And furthermore,</b> if the explanation of the mishna is as stated by Rav Pappa, <b>what</b> is meant by the phrase: <b>But</b> the difference is that the firstborn son takes a double portion of the property of the father, and he does not take a double portion of the property of the mother? According to this explanation as well, the first clause of the mishna has nothing to do with inheriting from the mother.
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying:</b> With regard to <b>both a son among the sons, and a daughter among the daughters, if</b> the father <b>says:</b> This particular child <b>shall inherit all my property, his statement stands.</b> A father can do so for any one son, or, when there are no sons, for any one daughter.
The Gemara asks: <b>In accordance with whose</b> opinion does Rav Ashi say this? Is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka?</b> The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches this later</b> (130a), as <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says: If</b> one <b>said about</b> another <b>who is fit to inherit</b> from <b>him</b> that the named individual should inherit all his property, <b>his statement stands,</b> but if one said it <b>about</b> another <b>who is unfit to inherit</b> from <b>him, his statement does not stand.</b> It is not reasonable to say that this mishna is stating the same <i>halakha</i> that is recorded in the later mishna in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.
<b>And if you would say that the <i>tanna</i> here taught us an unattributed</b> mishna <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> in order to demonstrate that his opinion is accepted as <i>halakha</i>, this would not establish the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with his opinion. The reason is that this would be an instance of <b>an unattributed</b> mishna <b>and thereafter</b> a mishnaic <b>dispute</b> concerning the same matter, as in the later mishna there is a <i>tanna</i> who disagrees with the ruling of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka; <b>and</b> in an instance of <b>an unattributed</b> mishna <b>and thereafter</b> a mishnaic <b>dispute, the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with the unattributed</b> mishna.
<b>And furthermore,</b> if the explanation of the mishna is as stated by Rav Ashi, <b>what</b> is meant by the clause: <b>But</b> the difference is that the firstborn son takes a double portion of the property of the father, and he does not take a double portion of the property of the mother? According to this explanation as well, the first clause of the mishna has nothing to do with inheriting from the mother.
<b>Rather, Mar bar Rav Ashi said: This</b> is what the mishna <b>is saying: Both the son and the daughter are equal</b> in their rights both <b>with regard to</b> the <b>property of the mother and with regard to</b> the <b>property of the father.</b> Sons and daughters can inherit from either fathers or mothers. <b>But</b> the differences are that <b>the</b> firstborn <b>son takes a double</b> portion <b>of the property of the father, and he does not take a double</b> portion <b>of the property of the mother,</b> and that the daughters are sustained from their father’s estate before it is disbursed to the children, but they are not sustained from the property of their mother.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“But he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), this means the firstborn receives <b>double</b> the property received <b>by</b> any other <b>one</b> inheritor. The <i>baraita</i> analyzes this statement: <b>Do you say</b> the firstborn receives <b>double</b> the property received <b>by</b> any <b>one</b> inheritor, <b>or rather, is it a double</b> portion <b>of all the property,</b> such that the firstborn receives two-thirds of the entire estate, which is twice the portion left for the other inheritors to divide between themselves? The <i>baraita</i> suggests: <b>And this</b> question can be resolved through <b>logical inference:</b>

Daf 123a

There may be times when a firstborn takes <b>his portion</b> of the inheritance, dividing the estate <b>with one</b> other brother, <b>and</b> there may be times when a firstborn takes <b>his portion</b> of the inheritance, dividing the estate <b>with five</b> brothers, and there is no indication that the Torah differentiates between the manner in which the respective firstborns collect in each scenario. Therefore, <b>just as</b> when a firstborn takes <b>his portion,</b> dividing the estate <b>with one</b> other brother, he receives <b>double</b> the property received <b>by one</b> inheritor, <b>so too,</b> when a firstborn takes <b>his portion</b> of the inheritance, dividing the estate <b>with five</b> brothers, he receives <b>double</b> the property received <b>by one</b> inheritor.
The <i>baraita</i> suggests the opposite logical derivation: <b>Or</b> perhaps <b>go this way:</b> There may be times when a firstborn takes <b>his portion</b> of the inheritance, dividing the estate <b>with one</b> other brother, <b>and</b> there may be times when a firstborn takes <b>his portion</b> of the inheritance, dividing the estate <b>with five</b> brothers. Therefore, <b>just as</b> when a firstborn takes <b>his portion,</b> dividing the estate <b>with one</b> other brother, he receives <b>a double</b> portion <b>of all the property, so too</b> when a firstborn takes <b>his portion</b> of the inheritance, dividing the estate <b>with five</b> brothers, he receives <b>a double</b> portion <b>of all the property.</b>
As the logical inference can lead to either conclusion, the <i>halakha</i> is determined by a derivation from a verse. <b>The verse states: “Then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:16). As the next verse spells out: “But he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he has” (Deuteronomy 21:17), the former verse is ostensibly redundant. The additional verse is therefore understood as an inclusion: <b>The Torah increased inheritance with regard to</b> the <b>brothers,</b> indicating that the more brothers there are, the greater the portion they collect from the entire estate. <b>Therefore, you should not reason in accordance with the final formulation,</b> in which the <i>baraita</i> suggests that the firstborn inherits twice as much as all the other brothers combined, <b>but in accordance with the first formulation,</b> according to which the firstborn inherits twice as much as each other brother.
The <i>baraita</i> reinforces this statement by citing additional verses: <b>And</b> the verse <b>states: “And the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, for he was the firstborn; but, inasmuch as he defiled his father’s couch, his birthright [<i>bekhorato</i>] was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, yet not so that he was to be reckoned in the genealogy as firstborn”</b> (I Chronicles 5:1). <b>And</b> the following verse <b>states: “For Judah prevailed above his brothers, and the prince came of him; but the birthright [<i>vehabekhora</i>] was Joseph’s”</b> (I Chronicles 5:2).
The <i>baraita</i> derives: <b>Birthright,</b> i.e., firstborn status, <b>is stated</b> here <b>with regard to Joseph, and birthright is stated</b> in another verse concerning the double portion <b>with regard to</b> the later <b>generations:</b> “By giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the first-fruits of his strength, the birthright [<i>habekhora</i>] is his” (Deuteronomy 21:17). <b>Just as the birthright stated with regard to Joseph</b> is <b>double</b> the property received <b>by one</b> inheritor, as the Gemara will explain, <b>so too the birthright stated with regard to</b> the later <b>generations</b> is <b>double</b> the property received <b>by one</b> inheritor.
The <i>baraita</i> cites additional related verses: <b>And</b> with regard to Jacob’s bequest to Joseph, the verse <b>states: “Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow”</b> (Genesis 48:22). The <i>baraita</i> explains the verse: <b>But</b> is it <b>so that</b> Jacob <b>took</b> the portion <b>with his sword and with his bow? But isn’t it already stated:</b> “Through You do we push down our adversaries; through Your name do we trample those that rise against us. <b>For I trust not in my bow, neither can my sword save me”</b> (Psalms 44:6–7)? <b>Rather,</b> what is the meaning of “with <b>my sword”? This</b> is referring to <b>prayer.</b> What is the meaning of “with <b>my bow”? This</b> is referring to <b>petition.</b> This concludes the <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What</b> is the reason the <i>baraita</i> cites additional proofs, introducing them with the term: <b>And</b> the verse <b>states?</b> The Gemara explains: <b>And if you would say</b> that the proof from the verse: “Then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit” is not valid, as perhaps <b>this</b> verse <b>comes to</b> teach the <i>halakha</i> <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka</b> that a father may designate property for whichever child he desires, then <b>come</b> and <b>hear</b> a separate proof: <b>“And the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel…</b>his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel.” As Joseph’s birthright was that his sons received two portions, evidently the birthright of the firstborn is that he receives double the amount received by one inheritor.
<b>And if you would say</b> that this is not a proof either, as <b>we do not derive</b> the meaning of the term: <b>“Birthright [<i>bekhora</i>]”</b> (see Deuteronomy 21:17) <b>from</b> the similar but not identical term of: <b>“His birthright [<i>bekhorato</i>],” come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the term employed in the following phrase from the verse: <b>“But the birthright [<i>vehabekhora</i>] was Joseph’s.”</b>
The Gemara continues to explicate the biblical citations in the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And if you would say</b> that this is not a proof either, as concerning <b>Joseph himself, from where</b> may it be learned <b>that</b> his birthright <b>was double</b> the property received <b>by one</b> inheritor? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof: <b>“Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers,”</b> indicating that Joseph received one more portion than each of the other sons of Jacob.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> Why not <b>say</b> that the term “one portion” is referring to <b>a mere palm tree</b> or some other relatively small extra gift, instead of a full, equal share? Abaye <b>said to him: For you,</b> i.e., to answer your question, the <b>verse states: “Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine”</b> (Genesis 48:5). Evidently, Joseph’s children together received portions equal to that of Reuben and Simeon together, i.e., two full portions.
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo asked Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: What did Jacob see that he took</b> the status as <b>firstborn from Reuben and gave it to Joseph?</b> The Gemara wonders: What does he mean, <b>what did</b> he <b>see?</b> The matter is <b>written</b> explicitly: <b>“But, inasmuch as he defiled his father’s couch,</b> his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph” (I Chronicles 5:1). <b>Rather,</b> Rabbi Ḥelbo’s question was: <b>What did he see that he gave it</b> specifically <b>to Joseph?</b>
Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani answered Rabbi Ḥelbo: <b>I will tell you a parable. To what is this matter comparable? To a homeowner who raised an orphan in his home. Eventually, that orphan became wealthy and said: I will provide benefit to the homeowner from my property.</b> Similarly, since Joseph sustained Jacob in Egypt for a number of years, Jacob saw fit to repay the kindness. Rabbi Ḥelbo <b>said to him: And if Reuben did not sin,</b> would Jacob <b>not have provided any benefit to Joseph?</b> It cannot be that Jacob repaid Joseph only as a result of Reuben’ sin.
<b>Rather, doesn’t your teacher Rabbi Yonatan say like this: It was appropriate for</b> the child receiving the status of <b>firstborn to emerge from Rachel, as it is written: “These are the generations of Jacob, Joseph”</b> (Genesis 37:2), indicating that Joseph was Jacob’s primary progeny. <b>But Leah advanced</b> ahead of Rachel <b>with</b> appeals for <b>mercy,</b> i.e., with prayer, and thereby earned the status as firstborn for her firstborn. <b>But because of</b> the <b>modesty that Rachel possessed, the Holy One, Blessed be He, returned</b> the status as firstborn <b>to her.</b> This is why Jacob gave the status as firstborn to Joseph.
The Gemara explains this answer: <b>What</b> does it mean that <b>Leah advanced</b> ahead of Rachel <b>with mercy? As it is written: “And Leah’s eyes were weak [<i>rakkot</i>]”</b> (Genesis 29:17). <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“<i>rakkot</i>”? If we say</b> that her eyes were <b>literally weak,</b> is it <b>possible</b> that the verse would say that? <b>The verse</b> there <b>did not speak to the disparagement of</b> even <b>a non-kosher animal, as it is written: “From the pure animals and from the animals that are lacking purity”</b> (Genesis 7:8). The verse states: “That are lacking purity” rather than stating explicitly and disparagingly: That are impure. If that is so with regard to animals, <b>did the verse speak</b> here <b>to the disparagement of the righteous? Rather, Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The term alludes to the fact <b>that her gifts,</b> i.e., the gifts given to her descendants, e.g., the priesthood and the monarchy, <b>were long-lasting [<i>arukkot</i>],</b> as they were passed down from generation to generation.
<b>Rav says</b> that there is a different explanation of the verse: <b>Actually,</b> the verse means that her eyes <b>were literally weak, and</b> this is <b>not a denigration of her but a praise of her. As she would hear people at the crossroads,</b> coming from the land of Canaan, <b>who would say: Rebecca has two sons,</b> and her brother <b>Laban has two daughters;</b> the <b>older</b> daughter will be married <b>to</b> the <b>older</b> son, <b>and</b> the <b>younger</b> daughter will be married <b>to</b> the <b>younger</b> son.
Rav continues: <b>And she would sit at the crossroads and ask: What</b> are <b>the deeds of</b> the <b>older</b> son? The passersby would answer: <b>He is an evil man,</b> and he <b>robs people.</b> She would ask: <b>What</b> are <b>the deeds of</b> the <b>younger</b> son? They would answer: He is <b>“a quiet man, dwelling in tents”</b> (Genesis 25:27). <b>And</b> because she was so distraught at the prospect of marrying the evil brother, <b>she would cry</b> and pray for mercy <b>until her eyelashes fell out.</b> Since the weakness of her eyes was due to this cause, characterizing her eyes as weak constitutes praise. This is Leah’s prayer for mercy to which Rabbi Yonatan referred.
The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> her desire not to marry Esau is the basis of that <b>which is written: “And the Lord saw that Leah was hated,</b> and He opened her womb” (Genesis 29:31). <b>What</b> is the meaning of <b>“hated”? If we say</b> that she was <b>literally hated,</b> is it <b>possible? The verse</b> there <b>did not speak to the disparagement of</b> even <b>a non-kosher animal,</b> so <b>did the verse</b> here <b>speak to the disparagement of the righteous? Rather, the Holy One, Blessed be He, saw that the behavior of Esau was hated by her,</b> and therefore: <b>“And He opened her womb.”</b>
The Gemara now explains the second part of Rabbi Yonatan’s explanation: <b>And what</b> was a demonstration of the <b>modesty that Rachel possessed? As it is written: “And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebecca’s son”</b> (Genesis 29:12). The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t he the son of her father’s sister?</b> Why did he say that he was her father’s brother? <b>Rather,</b> Jacob and Rachel had the following exchange: Jacob <b>said to</b> Rachel: <b>Will you marry me?</b> Rachel <b>said to him: Yes, but</b> my <b>father is a deceitful person, and you cannot defeat him.</b>
Jacob <b>said to her: What is his</b> method of <b>deceit</b> of which I need be aware? Rachel <b>said to him: I have a sister who is older than me, and he will not marry me</b> off <b>before</b> he marries <b>her</b> off, even if he promises that he will do so. Jacob <b>said to her: I am his brother,</b> i.e., equal, <b>in deceit,</b> and he will not be able to deceive me. That is why Jacob said that he was “her father’s brother.” Rachel <b>said to him: But is it permitted for the righteous to act deceitfully?</b> Jacob answered her: <b>Yes,</b> in certain circumstances. As the verse states concerning God: <b>“With the pure You show Yourself pure; and with the crooked You show Yourself subtle”</b> (II Samuel 22:27). Therefore, to counter Laban’s deceit, Jacob <b>gave</b> Rachel secret <b>signs</b> to prove to him that she was the one marrying him.
Laban did in fact attempt to have Jacob marry Leah instead of marrying Rachel. <b>When</b> Laban’s associates <b>were bringing Leah up</b> to the wedding canopy to marry Jacob, Rachel <b>thought: Now my sister will be humiliated</b> when Jacob discovers that she is the one marrying him. Therefore, Rachel <b>gave</b> the signs <b>to</b> Leah. <b>And this is as it is written: “And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah”</b> (Genesis 29:25). This verse is difficult, as <b>by inference,</b> should one derive <b>that until now she was not Leah? Rather, through the signs that Jacob gave to Rachel and that she gave to Leah, he did not know</b> it was <b>she until that moment.</b> This is the modesty of Rachel to which Rabbi Yonatan was referring.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of Jacob’s family. <b>Abba Ḥalifa Karoya asked Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba: In the total</b> tally of Jacob’s family members who descended to Egypt, <b>you find seventy,</b> as stated in the verse: “All the souls of the house of Jacob, that came into Egypt, were seventy” (Genesis 46:27). By contrast, <b>in their individual</b> listing, when the family members of each of his sons are listed by name, <b>you find seventy-less-one.</b> How can this be resolved? Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said to him: A twin</b> sister <b>was</b> born <b>with Dinah, as it is written: “And [<i>ve’et</i>] his daughter Dinah”</b> (Genesis 46:15). The term <i>et</i> implies an unspecified additional person. Abba Ḥalifa Karoya replied: <b>If that is so,</b> one would have to say that <b>a twin</b> sister <b>was</b> born <b>with Benjamin, as it is written:</b>

Daf 123b

“And he lifted up his eyes, and saw <b><i>et</i> Benjamin his brother, his mother’s son”</b> (Genesis 43:29), which would render the count of seventy in-correct. Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba <b>said:</b> There <b>was a goodly pearl [<i>margalit</i>] in my hand, and you are trying to have me lose it.</b> He continued: <b>So said Rabbi Ḥama bar Ḥanina: This</b> missing seventieth person is <b>Jochebed, whose conception was on the journey,</b> as the family of Jacob descended to Egypt, <b>and she was born within the walls,</b> i.e., in Egypt, <b>as it is stated:</b> “And the name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, <b>who was born to Levi in Egypt”</b> (Numbers 26:59). <b>Her birth</b> was <b>in Egypt, but her conception</b> was <b>not in Egypt.</b> Accordingly, the family had seventy persons upon arrival, but she could not have been listed as descending to Egypt.
§ <b>Rabbi Ḥelbo asked Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: It is written: “And it came to pass, when Rachel gave birth to Joseph,</b> that Jacob said to Laban: Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country” (Genesis 30:25). <b>What was different when Joseph was born,</b> that Jacob decided only then to return home? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani <b>said to him: Jacob our patriarch saw</b> prophetically <b>that the descendants of Esau</b> will be <b>delivered only to the hand of the descendants of Joseph, as it is stated: “And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for straw,</b> and they shall kindle in them, and devour them” (Obadiah 1:18). Jacob had left Eretz Yisrael to escape Esau, but he now felt confident that he could return without endangering his family.
Rabbi Ḥelbo <b>raised an objection to</b> Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani: Concering a battle between the Jewish people and the nation of Amalek, who descend from Esau, the verse states: <b>“And David smote them from the twilight even to the evening of the next day”</b> (I Samuel 30:17). David was from the tribe of Judah, yet he was able to defeat the descendants of Esau. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani <b>said to him: Whoever read</b> and taught <b>Prophets to you did not read</b> and teach <b>Writings to you, as it is written: “As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands that were of Manasseh,</b> and they helped David against the troop” (I Chronicles 12:21–2). The verse in Writings teaches that David’s campaign against Esau was led by Joseph’s descendants, from the family of Manasseh.
<b>Rav Yosef raises an objection:</b> Another verse indicates that the descendants of Simeon also have the ability to defeat the descendants of Esau: <b>“And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to Mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Ne’ariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi. And they struck the remnant of the Amalekites that escaped, and dwelled there until this day”</b> (I Chronicles 4:42–43). <b>Rabba bar Sheila said</b> in response: <b>Ishi came from</b> the <b>children of Manasseh, as it is written: And the sons of Manasseh: Hepher and Ishi.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:4–5): <b>The firstborn</b> priest <b>takes a double</b> portion <b>of the foreleg, and of the jaw, and of the maw,</b> which are given to a priest from all slaughtered non-sacred cattle, sheep, and goats (see Deuteronomy 18:3). <b>And</b> a firstborn, whether he is a priest or non-priest, takes a double portion <b>of</b> his father’s <b>sacrificial</b> animals <b>and of the enhancement of the property</b> that occurred <b>after the death of their father.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>How so?</b> To what type of enhancement is this referring? If <b>their father left them a cow</b> that was <b>leased or rented in the possession of others, or if it was grazing in the meadow, and it gave birth,</b> then the <b>firstborn takes a double</b> portion of the rental income or of the calf. <b>But</b> if the inheritors <b>built homes or planted vineyards</b> after their father’s death, thereby enhancing the property, the <b>firstborn does not take a double</b> portion. This is not considered enhancement of the father’s property, but profit due to their actions.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: Concerning <b>this</b> right to collect a double portion of <b>the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw, what are the circumstances? If</b> they <b>came into the possession of their father,</b> then it is <b>obvious</b> that the firstborn collects a double portion. <b>And if</b> they <b>did not come into the possession of their father,</b> then these items <b>are</b> merely property <b>due</b> to their father, <b>and the firstborn does not take</b> a double portion <b>of</b> property <b>due</b> to the deceased <b>as</b> he does the property his father <b>possessed.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Here, we are dealing with associates of the priesthood,</b> i.e., people who have an arrangement with a specific priest to give him their priestly gifts. <b>And</b> it was a case <b>where</b> the animal <b>was slaughtered while the father was alive, and</b> the <i>tanna</i> of this <i>baraita</i> <b>holds:</b> Priestly <b>gifts that were not</b> yet <b>separated are considered as though they</b> have already been <b>separated.</b> Therefore, even though the gifts were not yet given, they were considered in the possession of the priest before his death.
The Gemara continues to analyze the <i>baraita</i>: Why does the firstborn take a double portion of the father’s <b>sacrificial</b> animals? Isn’t it so that once the father consecrates them, <b>they</b> belong to Heaven and <b>are not his?</b>
The Gemara answers: This is stated <b>with regard to</b> a case of <b>offerings of lesser sanctity,</b> such as peace offerings, <b>and in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says:</b> These sacrificial animals <b>are</b> considered the <b>property of</b> their <b>owners,</b> as opposed to property of Heaven. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that concerning one who steals another’s property and takes a false oath denying he has done so, incurring the obligation to bring a guilt-offering, the verse states: <b>“And commits a trespass against the Lord,</b> and deals falsely with his neighbor” (Leviticus 5:21). The verse serves <b>to include offerings of lesser sanctity, which are</b> the <b>property of</b> their <b>owners;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili.</b> Consequently, the firstborn collects a double portion of these as well.
The <i>baraita</i> states: If <b>their father left them a cow</b> that was <b>leased or rented in the possession of others, or if it was grazing in the meadow, and it gave birth,</b> then the <b>firstborn takes a double</b> portion of the rental income or calf. The Gemara asks: <b>Now</b> that in a case where the cow was <b>leased or rented</b> to others, <b>where</b> the animals <b>are not in their owner’s possession, you say</b> that the firstborn <b>takes</b> a double portion, in a case where it was <b>grazing in the meadow, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> for the <i>baraita</i> to state that he receives a double portion?
The Gemara answers that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us:</b> It teaches <b>that</b> a case where the animal was <b>leased or rented is similar to</b> a case where it was <b>grazing in the meadow,</b> in that <b>just as</b> in a case where it was <b>grazing in the meadow, the enhancement came by itself and</b> the brothers <b>did not lose</b> money for <b>its sustenance,</b>

Daf 124a

<b>so too</b> in the case of a cow that was <b>leased or rented,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring only to a case where <b>the enhancement came by itself, as</b> the brothers <b>did not lose</b> money for <b>its sustenance,</b> since it was stipulated that the one who rented or leased it would provide its feed.
§ The Gemara continues its discussion of the <i>baraita</i>. In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is the <i>baraita</i>? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:4): <b>A firstborn does not take a double</b> portion <b>of the enhancement of the property</b> that occurred <b>after the death of</b> the sons’ <b>father. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: I say</b> that <b>a firstborn does take a double</b> portion <b>of the enhancement of the property</b> that occurred by itself <b>after their father’s death,</b> e.g., the birth of a calf, <b>but not of the enhancement that the orphans caused after their father’s death.</b>
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi continues: Therefore, if they <b>inherited a promissory note</b> indicating a debt owed to their father, the <b>firstborn takes a double</b> portion of the money when it is collected, as this is an enhancement to the estate that came by itself. The Gemara adds: In a case where <b>a promissory note emerged against them</b> for their father’s debt, the <b>firstborn gives,</b> i.e., repays, <b>a double</b> portion of the debt. <b>But if he says: I am not giving</b> a double portion of the debt <b>and I am not taking</b> a double portion of the estate, he is <b>permitted</b> to do so, and he is exempt from paying a double portion.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of the Rabbis</b> that the firstborn does not receive a double portion of any enhancements that occur after the death of the father? <b>The verse states: “Giving him a double portion”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17); by employing the term “giving” <b>the Merciful One calls</b> the double portion <b>a gift. Just as</b> a recipient of a gift does not acquire <b>a gift unless it</b> first <b>reaches the possession of</b> the one giving the gift, <b>so too</b> the firstborn does not acquire <b>the portion of the firstborn unless it has reached the possession of</b> the father before he died.
<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says</b> that the reason for his ruling that a firstborn receives a double portion of the enhancement is that <b>the verse states: “A double portion”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17). It <b>juxtaposes the portion of the firstborn to the portion of an ordinary</b> son, in that <b>just as the portion of an ordinary</b> son is inherited <b>even</b> from property <b>that did not reach</b> the father’s <b>possession</b> before he died, <b>so too, the portion of the firstborn</b> is inherited <b>even</b> from property <b>that did not reach</b> the father’s <b>possession</b> before he died.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>the Rabbis as well, isn’t</b> the phrase <b>“a double portion” written?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> phrase can be said to teach a different <i>halakha</i>, requiring the brothers <b>to give</b> the firstborn both of his portions <b>on one border,</b> i.e., adjoining, and not in separate locations.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> according to <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>as well, isn’t</b> the phrase <b>“giving him” written?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> phrase can be said to teach a different <i>halakha</i>, <b>that if</b> the firstborn <b>says: I am not taking</b> a double portion of the estate <b>and I am not giving</b> a double portion of the debt, he is <b>permitted</b> to do so. Since the inheritance is referred to as a gift, he has the right to refuse it.
The Gemara discusses several types of enhancement. <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> With regard to <b>a palm tree that</b> became enhanced by <b>growing broader</b> after the father’s death, or <b>land that yielded silt</b> and thereby became enhanced, <b>everyone agrees that</b> the firstborn <b>takes</b> a double portion of the enhancement. <b>When they disagree</b> is in a case <b>when fodder [<i>baḥafura</i>],</b> i.e., grain that has grown stalks but is not yet ripe, <b>becomes full ears,</b> of grain, and when <b>date flowers [<i>shelofafei</i>] become</b> fully developed <b>dates.</b> As one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that since this <b>enhancement</b> develops <b>by itself,</b> the firstborn is entitled to a double portion of it, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the Rabbis, <b>holds</b> that since the item <b>transformed,</b> it is not considered the same item that was in the father’s possession, and the firstborn is not entitled to a double portion of it.
§ <b>Rabba bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya says:</b> A judge who <b>acted,</b> i.e., ruled, <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>has acted</b> legally, and one who acted <b>in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis has</b> also <b>acted</b> legally. Either way, the decision stands.

Daf 124b

The Gemara explains: Rabbi Ḥiyya <b>is uncertain</b> as to <b>whether</b> the principle that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi in his disputes <b>with his colleague</b> applies specifically to a dispute with one other <i>tanna</i> <b>but not</b> to a dispute <b>with</b> several of <b>his colleagues, or</b> whether the principle that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi in his disputes <b>with his colleague</b> applies <b>even to</b> a dispute with several of <b>his colleagues,</b> as in this case, where the Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi. Since he was uncertain, he left the decision to each individual judge.
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It is <b>prohibited to act in accordance with the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara explains: Rav <b>holds</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi in his disputes <b>with his</b> single <b>colleague, but not</b> in his disputes <b>with</b> several of <b>his colleagues.</b>
<b>And Rav Naḥman says his own</b> statement: It is <b>permitted to act in accordance with the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara explains: <b>He holds</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi not only in his disputes <b>with his</b> single <b>colleague, but even</b> in his disputes <b>with</b> several of <b>his colleagues.</b>
<b>Rava says:</b> It is <b>prohibited to act in accordance with the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>but if</b> a judge <b>acted</b> in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, what is done <b>is done</b> and the decision stands. The Gemara explains: <b>He holds</b> that it <b>was stated</b> that <b>one is inclined</b> to follow the opinion of the Rabbis <i>ab initio</i>, but if a judge rules in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, his decision stands.
The Gemara comments that there are conflicting opinions in halakhic midrash as to whether the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi or in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, as each opinion is supported by a different version of the midrash. <b>Rav Naḥman taught</b> a <i>baraita</i> <b>from the other books of the school of Rav [<i>debei Rav</i>],</b> i.e., a volume of halakhic midrash other than <i>Torat Kohanim</i>, which is a halakhic midrash on the book of Leviticus. The phrase from the verse: “By giving him a double portion <b>of all that he has”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:17), <b>excludes the enhancement that the heirs brought about after their father’s death,</b> of which the firstborn is not entitled to a double portion. The Gemara infers: <b>But</b> of <b>the enhancement of the property</b> that occurred by itself <b>after their father’s death, he does take</b> a double portion. The Gemara comments: <b>And whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi.
<b>Rami bar Ḥama taught</b> a different version of the <i>baraita</i> <b>from the other books of the school of Rav: “Of all that he has” excludes</b> the <b>enhancement of the property</b> that occurred by itself <b>after their father’s death,</b> of which the firstborn is not entitled to a double portion. The Gemara infers: <b>And all the more so, he does not take</b> a double portion of the <b>enhancement that the heirs brought about after their father’s death.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And whose</b> opinion is this? <b>It is</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> Accordingly, there is a discrepancy between the <i>baraitot</i> as to whether the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis or Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: A firstborn does not take a double</b> portion <b>of a loan,</b> i.e., of a debt that is owed to the father. The Gemara asks: <b>According to whom</b> is this <i>halakha</i> stated? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, now</b> that <b>the Rabbis say</b> that a firstborn <b>does not take</b> a double portion even with regard to the <b>enhancement</b> of property <b>that is in the possession of</b> the father, is it <b>necessary</b> to state that he is not entitled to a double portion of <b>a loan?</b> The debt is not in the father’s possession at the time of his death; it is merely due to him.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. Although he holds that a firstborn is entitled to a double portion of the enhancement of the property itself, he concedes that he is not entitled to a double portion of the payment of a debt, as it was not in the possession of his father at the time of his death.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if so, in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion is <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If the sons <b>inherited a promissory note,</b> the <b>firstborn takes a double</b> portion <b>of</b> the payment of <b>both</b> the value of <b>the loan</b> itself <b>and the interest?</b> It is <b>neither</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>nor</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> Shmuel’s statement that the firstborn is not entitled to a double portion of the payment of a debt is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, and it was necessary</b> to state it. It might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that with regard to <b>a loan, since</b> the creditor <b>holds</b> a promissory <b>note, it is considered as though it has</b> already <b>been collected</b> and is in the creditor’s possession, so too, the firstborn should be entitled to a double portion even according to the opinion of the Rabbis. Therefore, Shmuel <b>teaches us</b> that the loan is not considered to be in the creditor’s possession, and the firstborn is not entitled to a double portion.
The Gemara relates: <b>They sent</b> the following ruling <b>from there,</b> Eretz Yisrael: If the father lent money to a gentile, the <b>firstborn takes a double</b> portion of the value <b>of</b> the <b>loan</b> itself, <b>but not of</b> the <b>interest,</b> as the interest is considered property due to the father.
The Gemara asks: <b>According to whom</b> is this <i>halakha</i> stated? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis, now</b> that <b>the Rabbis say</b> that a firstborn <b>does not take</b> a double portion even with regard to the <b>enhancement</b> of property, <b>which is in the possession of</b> the father, is it <b>necessary</b> to state that they would hold that he is not entitled to a double portion of <b>a loan?</b> Since the debt is not in the father’s possession at the time of his death, as it is merely due to him, the rabbis would certainly not hold that the firstborn takes a double portion of it.
<b>Rather,</b> it must be <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. The Gemara asks: <b>And according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, is it so that the firstborn is <b>not</b> entitled to a double portion <b>of the interest? But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: A firstborn takes a double</b> portion <b>of both</b> the value of <b>the loan</b> itself <b>and the interest?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>halakha</i> sent from the Sages of Eretz Yisrael <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis. And</b> the Sages of Eretz Yisrael hold that the Rabbis concede that the firstborn receives a double portion of the value of the loan itself, because <b>a loan is considered as though it has</b> already <b>been collected</b> and is in the creditor’s possession. By contrast, the interest on the loan is not considered as though it is already in the creditor’s possession, and therefore the firstborn does not receive a double portion of its payment.
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav said to Ravina: Ameimar arrived at our locale and taught</b> that <b>a firstborn takes a double</b> portion <b>of</b> the value of <b>a loan</b> itself, <b>but not of</b> the <b>interest.</b> Ravina <b>said to him:</b> The Sages <b>of Neharde’a</b> conform <b>to their</b> standard line of <b>reasoning.</b> Ameimar followed the opinion of Rav Naḥman, who was one of the Sages of Naharde’a, as was Ameimar.
The Gemara explains: <b>As Rabba says:</b> If the sons <b>collected land</b> as payment of a debt owed to their father, the firstborn <b>has</b> a double portion of it, but if <b>they collected money, he does not have</b> a double portion. <b>And Rav Naḥman says</b> that if <b>they collected money, he has</b> a double portion, but if <b>they collected land, he does not have</b> a double portion.
<b>Abaye said to Rabba: According to your</b> opinion it <b>is difficult,</b> and <b>according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> it <b>is</b> also <b>difficult. According to your</b> opinion it <b>is difficult</b>

Daf 125a

because <b>what is different</b> about <b>money,</b> resulting in the <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> the firstborn is <b>not</b> entitled to a double portion of it, is <b>that their father did not leave</b> them <b>this</b> specific <b>money</b> that was collected. With regard to <b>land as well, their father did not leave</b> them <b>this</b> specific parcel of <b>land</b> when he died, as the debtor could have repaid them with a different parcel of land, or with money.
<b>And furthermore, aren’t you</b> the one <b>who said</b> that <b>the explanation of the people of the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, <b>is reasonable?</b> In a case where a married woman had been fit to inherit from her great-grandmother but then predeceased her great-grandmother, who then died, and her widower claims the inheritance in his late wife’s stead, the Sages of Eretz Yisrael ruled that he is not entitled to the inheritance, as it is merely property due to his wife, and a husband does not inherit property due to be inherited by his late wife. Rabba agreed that the inheritance is considered property due to the wife, and not property possessed by her, <b>as if the</b> great-<b>grandmother would have sold it before</b> she died, <b>her sale would have been</b> a valid <b>sale.</b> Here, too, the land should be considered property due to the father, of which a firstborn is not entitled to a double portion, since the debtor could have sold it. Therefore, Rabba’s opinion is difficult.
Abaya continues: <b>According to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> it is <b>difficult; what is different</b> about <b>land,</b> resulting in the <i>halakha</i> <b>that</b> the firstborn is <b>not</b> entitled to a double portion of it, is <b>that their father did not leave</b> them <b>this</b> specific parcel of <b>land.</b> With regard to <b>money as well, their father did not leave</b> them <b>this</b> specific <b>money</b> when he died.
<b>And furthermore, doesn’t Rav Naḥman say</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> With regard to <b>orphans who collected land for a debt owed to their father,</b> their father’s <b>creditor</b> can <b>come and seize this</b> land <b>from them,</b> as any land owned by the father is liened against his debts. Evidently, Rav Naḥman holds that land liened against a debt has the legal status of land that is in the possession of the creditor. If so, why does Rav Naḥman hold that a firstborn is not entitled to a double portion of land that is collected as payment of a debt?
Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>According to my</b> opinion it <b>is not difficult, and according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Naḥman</b> it <b>is not difficult. We were</b> merely <b>saying,</b> i.e., explaining, <b>the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of the people of the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, introduced with the phrase: They sent the following ruling from there, that a firstborn is entitled to a double portion of the payment of a debt. <b>But we ourselves do not hold</b> in accordance with that opinion. Therefore, one cannot raise a contradiction from our opinions stated elsewhere to what we said in explanation of the Sages of Eretz Yisrael.
Having mentioned in passing the case of the great-grandmother, the Gemara discusses that case in depth. <b>What</b> is the case of the great-<b>grandmother</b> that was mentioned by Abaye? The Gemara explains: There was <b>a certain</b> moribund person <b>who said to</b> those present:

Daf 125b

All <b>my property</b> is given <b>to</b> my <b>grandmother, and after she</b> dies, it is given <b>to my heirs,</b> not inherited by her heirs. He then died. <b>He had a married daughter,</b> who <b>died during the lifetime of her husband and during the lifetime of</b> her father’s <b>grandmother. After</b> her father’s <b>grandmother died,</b> her <b>husband came and claimed</b> the inheritance, as his wife was the heir of her father, and he is his wife’s heir.
<b>Rav Huna said:</b> When her father said that his property is given: <b>To my heirs,</b> he meant: <b>And even to the heirs of my heirs.</b> Therefore, since his daughter’s husband is the heir of his heir, he is entitled to the inheritance. <b>And Rav Anan said</b> that he meant: <b>To my heirs, but not to the heirs of my heirs.</b> Therefore, the husband is not entitled to the property.
The Gemara relates: <b>They sent</b> a ruling <b>from there,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Anan, but not due to his reasoning.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Anan that the husband does not inherit</b> the property. <b>But not due to his reasoning, as Rav Anan holds</b> that <b>even if his daughter had a son</b> to inherit from her, <b>he</b> would <b>not inherit</b> the property, as her father bequeathed it only to his heirs, not to the heirs of his heirs. <b>And</b> that <b>is not so, as if his daughter had a son, he</b> would <b>certainly inherit; and this is the reason the husband does not inherit: Because</b> the inheritance <b>is considered</b> property <b>due</b> to the daughter, as she did not own it during her lifetime, <b>and a husband does not take</b> in inheritance property <b>due</b> to his wife <b>as</b> he does the property she <b>possessed.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>By inference, does Rav Huna,</b> who ruled that the husband is entitled to the inheritance, <b>hold</b> that <b>a husband takes</b> in inheritance property <b>due</b> to his wife <b>as</b> he does the property she <b>possessed?</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar says: This matter was introduced by great</b> Sages, namely Rav Huna, <b>and concluded by lesser</b> Sages, i.e., by me. Rabbi Elazar, humbly referring to himself as a lesser Sage, will now explain Rav Huna’s statement. <b>Anyone who says</b> to another upon granting him an inheritance or a gift: <b>After you</b> die it is given to so-and-so, <b>is</b> considered <b>like one who says:</b> It is given to so-and-so <b>from now.</b> The first recipient merely has the right to use the property during his lifetime but did not actually become the owner. Accordingly, the inheritance was owned by the daughter in her lifetime, and the great-grandmother merely had usage rights. Therefore, it is inherited by the husband.
<b>Rabba said: The explanation of the people of the West,</b> that the inheritance is considered property due to the daughter and not property possessed by her, <b>is reasonable, as if the grandmother would have sold it before</b> she died, <b>her sale would have been</b> a valid <b>sale,</b> and the daughter would not have received it at all.
In conclusion, <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>the husband does not take</b> in inheritance property <b>due</b> to his wife <b>as</b> he does the property she <b>possessed; and a firstborn does not take</b> a double portion of property <b>due</b> to his father <b>as</b> he does the property his father <b>possessed; and a firstborn does not take a double</b> portion <b>of</b> payment for <b>a loan, whether</b> the brothers <b>collected land</b> or <b>whether they collected money.</b>

Daf 126a

<b>And</b> as for <b>a loan that is with</b> the firstborn, i.e., he had borrowed money from his father then his father died, it is uncertain whether the payment should be considered property due to the father or property possessed by him. Therefore, the firstborn and his brothers <b>divide</b> the additional portion.
§ With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that the firstborn is not entitled to a double portion of the enhancement of the property resulting from the actions of the heirs, <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav Asi says: A firstborn who protested</b> the efforts of enhancing the property before it is divided has <b>protested,</b> and if the brothers use resources from the estate to enhance it against his will, he is entitled to a double portion of the enhanced value.
<b>Rabba said: Rav Asi’s opinion is reasonable in</b> a case where they inherited <b>grapes</b> on a grapevine <b>and</b> the brothers <b>harvested them</b> against the will of the firstborn, or if they inherited <b>olives</b> on olive trees <b>and</b> the brothers <b>harvested them,</b> as in these cases, the produce itself did not change. <b>But</b> if <b>they treaded</b> on <b>them,</b> converting them into wine or oil, even if the firstborn protested their doing so, he is <b>not</b> entitled to a double portion. <b>And Rav Yosef said: Even</b> if they <b>treaded</b> on <b>them,</b> the firstborn is entitled to a double portion.
The Gemara asks: Why is he entitled to a double portion, according to Rav Yosef, even if <b>they treaded</b> on <b>them?</b> Since the brothers transformed the produce, as <b>initially</b> it was in the form of <b>grapes</b> and <b>now</b> it is <b>wine,</b> they have acquired it in the same manner that a thief acquires an item he stole. Therefore, the firstborn should have no share of the enhancement.
The Gemara answers: Rav Yosef did not mean that the firstborn is entitled to a double portion of the enhanced value of the wine. Rather, his intention was the same <b>as</b> that <b>which Rav Ukva bar Ḥama says</b> in a different context, that the ruling is referring <b>to</b> a case where the wine spoiled, its value decreasing to below the initial value of the grapes, in which case the brothers must <b>give</b> the firstborn <b>payment for</b> the <b>damage</b> to <b>his</b> additional portion of the <b>grapes. Here, too,</b> Rav Yosef meant that the brothers <b>must give</b> the firstborn <b>payment for</b> the <b>damage to his grapes.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Where,</b> i.e., in what context, <b>was</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ukva bar Ḥama stated?</b> It was <b>in reference to that which Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a firstborn and an ordinary</b> son <b>whose father left them grapes and they harvested them,</b> or if he left them <b>olives and they harvested them,</b> the <b>firstborn takes a double</b> portion. This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if <b>they treaded</b> on <b>them.</b> The Gemara asks: Why is he entitled to a double portion if <b>they treaded</b> on <b>them; initially</b> they were <b>grapes,</b> and <b>now</b> it is <b>wine? Mar Ukva bar Ḥama says:</b> Shmuel did not mean that he is entitled to a double portion of the wine; rather, the reference is <b>to</b> a case where the wine spoiled, its value decreasing to below the initial value of the grapes, in which case the ordinary brother must <b>give</b> the firstborn <b>payment for</b> the <b>damage</b> to <b>his grapes.</b>
§ <b>Rav Asi says: A firstborn who took a portion</b> of the property <b>like</b> that of <b>an ordinary</b> heir has <b>relinquished</b> his right to an additional portion. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does it mean that he has <b>relinquished</b> his additional portion? <b>Rav Pappa says in the name of Rava</b> that he has <b>relinquished</b> his additional portion only <b>with regard to that field</b> that was divided, since he did not exercise his right to an additional portion, but he has not relinquished his right to receive an additional portion of the rest of the estate. <b>Rav Pappi says in the name of Rava</b> that he has <b>relinquished</b> his additional portion <b>with regard to all</b> of <b>the property.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Pappa says in the name of Rava</b> that he has <b>relinquished</b> his additional portion only <b>with regard to that field</b> that was divided, because he <b>holds</b> that <b>a firstborn does not have</b> a right to his additional portion <b>before</b> the <b>division</b> of the property. <b>And</b> therefore, he <b>has waived</b> his additional portion of <b>what has</b> already <b>reached his possession,</b> namely, the field that was divided, but he <b>has not waived</b> his portion of <b>the other</b> fields of the estate.
<b>And Rav Pappi says in the name of Rava</b> that he has <b>relinquished</b> his additional portion <b>with regard to all</b> of <b>the property,</b> as <b>he holds</b> that <b>a firstborn has</b> a right to his additional portion <b>before</b> the <b>division</b> of the property. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>since</b> he <b>waived</b> his additional portion <b>in this</b> field, he <b>has waived</b> his portion <b>of all</b> of the property.
The Gemara notes: <b>And this</b> dispute <b>of Rav Pappi and Rav Pappa was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference. As</b> there was <b>a certain firstborn who went</b> and <b>sold his property and</b> the property <b>of</b> his deceased <b>ordinary</b> brother, i.e., their respective portions of their father’s property, before the property was divided. The <b>orphan sons of</b> the <b>ordinary</b> brother <b>went to eat dates from</b> the field that was now in the possession of <b>those purchasers,</b> due to their father’s share in the field. The purchasers <b>hit them,</b> as though they were thieves. The <b>relatives</b> of the orphans <b>said to</b> the purchasers: <b>Not only did you purchase their property</b> illegally, <b>but you now hit them as well? They came before Rava,</b> who <b>said to them:</b> The firstborn <b>has done nothing.</b> His sale was not valid.

Daf 126b

Rav Pappi and Rav Pappa disagree with regard to Rava’s intention. One <b>Sage,</b> Rav Pappi, <b>holds</b> that <b>he has done nothing with regard to</b> his brother’s <b>portion,</b> as he had no right to sell it; with regard to his own additional portion, the sale was valid, as it was in his possession even before the division of the property. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rav Pappa, <b>holds</b> that he has done nothing <b>with regard to all</b> of the property, as he does not possess the additional portion before the property is divided between the brothers.
The Gemara notes that <b>they sent</b> a ruling <b>from there,</b> Eretz Yisrael: <b>A firstborn who sold</b> his additional portion <b>before</b> the <b>division</b> of the property <b>has done nothing. Apparently,</b> the Sages of Eretz Yisrael hold that <b>a firstborn does not have</b> a right to his additional portion <b>before</b> the <b>division. But the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a firstborn has</b> a right to his additional portion <b>before</b> the <b>division.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Mar Zutra of</b> the house <b>of Rishba,</b> who was a firstborn, <b>divided a basket of peppers</b> from the estate of his father <b>with</b> his <b>brothers equally.</b> He <b>came before Rav Ashi</b> to claim a double portion of the rest of the estate. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Since you relinquished</b> your additional portion <b>with regard to some</b> of the estate, <b>you have relinquished</b> your additional portion <b>with regard to all of the property,</b> as a firstborn has a right to his additional portion before the division.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>one who says: So-and-so, my firstborn son, will not take a double</b> portion of my estate; or one who says: <b>So-and-so, my son, will not inherit</b> my estate <b>among his brothers, he has said nothing, as he has stipulated counter to that which is written in the Torah.</b>
With regard to <b>one</b> on his deathbed <b>who apportions his property orally,</b> granting it to his sons as a gift, and he <b>increased</b> the portion given <b>to one</b> of his sons <b>and reduced</b> the portion given <b>to one</b> son, <b>or equated</b> the portion of <b>the firstborn to</b> the portions of the other sons, <b>his statement stands. But if he said</b> that they will receive the property not as a gift but <b>as inheritance, he has said nothing.</b> If he <b>wrote</b> in his will, <b>whether at the beginning, or in the middle, or at the end,</b> that he is granting them the property <b>as a gift, his statement stands.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that the mishna is not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as if</b> it is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, doesn’t he say</b> elsewhere that if one stipulates counter to that which is written in the Torah <b>with regard to monetary matters, his stipulation stands?</b>
<b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Kiddushin</i> 3:7): If one <b>says to a woman: You are hereby betrothed to me on the condition that you have no</b> ability to claim <b>from me food, clothing, and conjugal rights, she is betrothed and his stipulation is void;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: With regard to monetary matters,</b> such as food and clothing, <b>his stipulation stands,</b> despite being counter to that which is written in the Torah. According to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, one should be able to stipulate that his firstborn son not receive a double portion, or that one of his sons not inherit from him at all, as inheritance is a monetary matter.
The Gemara rejects this suggestion: <b>Even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, there,</b> the woman <b>knew</b> of his stipulation <b>and waived</b> her rights. Therefore, the stipulation stands. <b>Here,</b> the son whose portion was reduced <b>did not waive</b> his portion. Therefore the stipulation is not valid.
§ <b>Rav Yosef says</b> that if a man <b>says: So-and-so is my firstborn son,</b> the son <b>takes a double</b> portion of his inheritance based on this testimony. If he says: <b>So-and-so is a firstborn,</b> the son <b>does not take a double</b> portion, as <b>perhaps</b> the man <b>was saying</b> that the son is his <b>mother’s firstborn</b> but not his own firstborn.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who came before Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> and <b>said to him: I know that this</b> man <b>is a firstborn.</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana <b>said to him: From where do you know?</b> He answered: <b>Because his father would call him a foolish firstborn.</b> Rabba bar bar Ḥana replied: <b>Perhaps he is</b> his <b>mother’s firstborn, as any firstborn of a mother is also called a foolish firstborn.</b>
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who came before Rabbi Ḥanina</b> and <b>said to him: I know that this</b> man <b>is a firstborn.</b> Rabbi Ḥanina <b>said to him: From where do you know? He said to</b> Rabbi Ḥanina: <b>Because when</b> people <b>would come before his father</b> to obtain a cure for their ailing eyes, <b>he would say to them: Go to my son Shikhḥat, as he is a firstborn and his saliva heals</b> this ailment.
The Gemara asks: <b>But perhaps he is</b> his <b>mother’s firstborn?</b> The Gemara answers: It <b>is learned</b> as a tradition that <b>the saliva of a father’s firstborn heals</b> this ailment but <b>the saliva of a mother’s firstborn does not heal</b> this ailment.
§ <b>Rabbi Ami says:</b> In the case of <b>one whose sexual organs are indeterminate [<i>tumtum</i>]</b> and <b>whose</b> skin <b>became perforated</b> so that his genitals were exposed <b>and</b> he <b>was found</b> to be <b>a male,</b> he <b>does not take a double</b> portion of his father’s estate. <b>As the verse states: “And if the firstborn son was [<i>vehaya</i>] hers that was hated”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:15), which is interpreted to mean that he is not considered a firstborn <b>unless he is</b> recognized as <b>a son,</b> i.e., male, <b>from the moment of</b> his coming into <b>being [<i>havaya</i>],</b> i.e., his birth.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says:</b> A <i>tumtum</i> who was found to be male <b>is also not judged as a stubborn and rebellious son, as the verse states: “If there will be [<i>yihyeh</i>] to a man a stubborn and rebellious son”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:18), which is interpreted to mean that one is not judged in this manner <b>unless he is</b> recognized as <b>a son from the moment of</b> his coming into <b>being.</b>

Daf 127a

<b>Ameimar says:</b> A <i>tumtum</i> who was found to be male <b>also does not reduce the</b> additional <b>portion of the firstborn.</b> His portion is not taken into account in the calculation of the firstborn’s additional portion. For example, if there are three brothers: A firstborn, an ordinary brother, and a <i>tumtum</i>, the firstborn receives one-third of the property as his additional portion, as he would if he and the ordinary brother were the only heirs, and the remaining two-thirds are divided among all three brothers. This is <b>because it is stated</b> with regard to the portion of the firstborn: <b>“And they have borne him sons”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:15), which is interpreted to mean that the brother of a firstborn does not affect his additional portion <b>unless he is</b> recognized as <b>a son at the moment of</b> his <b>birth.</b>
<b>Rav Sheizevi says:</b> A <i>tumtum</i> who was found to be male <b>is also not circumcised on</b> the <b>eighth</b> day, if his eighth day occurs on Shabbat, although the mitzva of circumcision on the eighth day generally overrides Shabbat prohibtions. <b>As the verse states: “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male</b> then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her sickness shall she be unclean. <b>And on the eighth day</b> the flesh of his foreskin <b>shall be circumcised”</b> (Leviticus 12:2–3), which is interpreted to mean that he is not circumcised on the eighth day, in the event that it occurs on Shabbat, <b>unless he is</b> recognized as <b>a male from the moment of</b> his <b>birth.</b>
<b>Rav Sherevya says: His mother is also not</b> rendered <b>ritually impure</b> due to his <b>birth, as the verse states: “If a woman bears seed and gives birth to a male, then she shall be unclean seven days,”</b> which is interpreted to mean that she is not rendered impure <b>unless he is</b> recognized as <b>a male from the moment of</b> his <b>birth.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 28a): A woman <b>who miscarries a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite [<i>ve’androginos</i>] observes</b> the strictures of a woman who gave birth <b>to a male and to a female.</b> Since it is uncertain whether the fetus is male or female, the woman must observe the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity according to both possibilities. This appears to be <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the statement <b>of Rav Sherevya</b> that a woman who gives birth to a <i>tumtum</i> is not rendered impure at all. The Gemara affirms: This is <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say it is</b> also <b>a conclusive refutation</b> of the statement <b>of Rav Sheizevi</b> with regard to circumcision, as the <i>halakha</i> of circumsicion is stated together with the <i>halakha</i> of ritual impurity?
The Gemara answers: The <b><i>tanna</i></b> of the mishna in tractate <i>Nidda</i> <b>is uncertain</b> whether the birth discussed in the verse includes that of a <i>tumtum</i>, <b>and</b> therefore he rules <b>stringently,</b> that she should observe the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity for both possibilities. Rav Sheizevi’s ruling can follow the same logic: The infant should not be circumcised on Shabbat, as it is uncertain whether the mitzva of his circumcision overrides the prohibitions of Shabbat.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna in tractate <i>Nidda</i> is uncertain whether the birth discussed in the verse includes that of a <i>tumtum</i>, the mishna <b>should have</b> stated that the woman <b>observes</b> the strictures of a woman who gave birth <b>to</b> both <b>a male and to a female, and</b> also <b>as a menstruating woman.</b> If it is uncertain whether the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual purity after birth pertain to a woman who gives birth to a <i>tumtum</i> at all, she should observe the <i>halakhot</i> of ritual impurity for any blood that emerges in the time period following the birth, as it should have the status of the blood of a menstruating woman. The Gemara concludes: This poses <b>a difficulty.</b>
<b>Rava says</b> that <b>it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Ami</b> that a <i>tumtum</i> firstborn does not receive a double portion of the inheritance. The <i>baraita</i> states: From the phrase “the firstborn son” (Deuteronomy 21:15) it is derived that only <b>a son</b> receives a double portion, <b>but not a <i>tumtum</i>,</b> and only a definite <b>firstborn</b> receives a double portion, <b>but not</b> one about whom it is <b>uncertain</b> if he is a firstborn.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> the <i>halakha</i> that <b>a son</b> receives a double portion <b>but a <i>tumtum</i></b> does <b>not</b> is understandable, as it <b>is in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ami, but what</b> case <b>does</b> the <i>halakha</i> that only a definite <b>firstborn</b> receives a double portion <b>but not</b> one about whom it is <b>uncertain</b> if he is a firstborn serve <b>to exclude?</b> Why would one about whom it is uncertain if he is a firstborn receive a double portion?
The Gemara answers: It serves <b>to exclude that which Rava taught, as Rava taught</b> that if <b>two wives</b> of the same husband <b>gave birth to two males in hiding,</b> so that it is unknown which son was born first, and the husband subsequently had other sons, <b>each</b> of the two possible firstborns <b>writes an authorization to the other.</b> Since their brothers can claim against each of them individually that he is not the firstborn and does not deserve a double portion, each writes the other an authorization to collect his portion, so that they can jointly claim the additional portion in any event.
<b>Rav Pappa</b> subsequently <b>said to Rava: But didn’t Ravin send</b> a letter from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, stating: <b>I asked all my teachers</b> about <b>this matter and they did not tell me anything; but this</b> is what <b>they said in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> If the two sons <b>were</b> initially <b>recognized,</b> i.e., it was known which one of them was the firstborn, <b>and</b> they <b>were ultimately mixed,</b> and now the firstborn cannot be identified, <b>each writes an authorization to the other.</b> If <b>they were not</b> initially <b>recognized, each does not write an authorization to the other.</b>
<b>Rava then established an <i>amora</i></b> to repeat his lesson to the masses aloud <b>and taught: The statements that I said to you are a mistake on my</b> part. <b>But this</b> is what <b>they said in the name of Rabbi Yannai:</b> If the two sons <b>were</b> initially <b>recognized and were ultimately mixed, each writes an authorization to the other.</b> If <b>they were not</b> initially <b>recognized, each does not write an authorization to the other.</b>
§ <b>The residents of Akra De’Agma sent</b> the following inquiry <b>to Shmuel: Teach us, our master:</b> If the court <b>had a presumption concerning this</b> son, <b>that he is a firstborn, and his father says concerning another</b> son of his: <b>He is</b> his <b>firstborn, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Shmuel <b>sent to them</b> in response: Both of these sons <b>write an authorization,</b>

Daf 127b

<b>each to the other.</b>
The Gemara questions this ruling: <b>Whichever way you</b> look at it, Shmuel’s opinion is difficult. <b>If he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis</b> with regard to this issue, <b>he should have sent them</b> a response <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> and <b>if he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, he should have sent them</b> a response <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> Shmuel’s response is not in accordance with either tannaitic opinion.
The Gemara answers: <b>He is uncertain whether</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda or in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b> Therefore he sent them a response that incorporates both opinions.
The Gemara explains: <b>What is</b> the dispute between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Expounding the verse: <b>“He shall acknowledge</b> the firstborn” (Deuteronomy 21:17), the Sages said: <b>He shall acknowledge him to others.</b> In other words, a father is deemed credible to tell others that this is his firstborn.
<b>From here, Rabbi Yehuda says</b> that <b>a man is deemed credible to say: This</b> is <b>my firstborn son,</b> even if he has sons presumed to be older. <b>And just as a man is deemed credible to say: This</b> is <b>my firstborn son, so too, a man</b> who is a priest <b>is deemed credible to say</b> about his son: <b>This</b> is <b>a son of a divorced woman, or: This</b> is <b>a son of a <i>yevama</i> who has performed <i>ḥalitza</i> [<i>ḥalutza</i>],</b> in which cases he is disqualified from the priesthood due to his flawed lineage [<i>ḥalal</i>]. <b>And the Rabbis say: He is not deemed credible.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: Granted,</b> according <b>to Rabbi Yehuda, this is</b> the reason <b>that it is written: “He shall acknowledge;”</b> he derives from these words that a father is deemed credible to attest to the identity of his sons. <b>But</b> according <b>to the Rabbis, why do I</b> need the term <b>“he shall acknowledge”?</b>
The Gemara answers: It is necessary for a case <b>when he requires identification,</b> i.e., when there is no presumption as to the identity of the firstborn. In such a situation the verse teaches that the father is deemed credible. The Rabbis disagree with Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion only in a case where another son is presumed to be the firstborn.
The Gemara asks: According to the Rabbis, <b>with regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is it necessary for the verse to teach that a father’s identification of his firstborn is deemed credible? If it is <b>with regard to giving him a double</b> portion, it is superfluous. <b>Let</b> the son <b>be only</b> like <b>another</b> person, i.e., one who is not an heir; <b>if</b> the father <b>wants to give him</b> a double portion of his estate <b>as a gift, can he not give</b> it to <b>him?</b> Since the father can give a double portion to the firstborn without having to testify that he is his firstborn, it cannot be that the verse is teaching us that he is deemed credible with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that a firstborn receives a double portion.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary with regard to property that came into</b> the father’s possession <b>afterward,</b> after he testified that his son is his firstborn. He could not have given him this property as a gift, as at the time of his testimony, the property did not yet belong to him, and one cannot transfer ownership of an item that one does not own. Therefore, it is necessary for the verse to teach that the father’s testimony is deemed credible so that the son can receive a double portion of the father’s future property as well.
The Gemara asks: <b>And according to Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>a person can transfer an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world,</b> which would mean that one can give away his property even before it enters his possession, <b>why do I</b> need the term <b>“he shall acknowledge”?</b>
The Gemara answers: The term is necessary for a case <b>where property came into</b> the father’s possession <b>when he was moribund,</b> at which point he cannot transfer ownership of any of his property to others. It is with regard to such property that the verse states: “He shall acknowledge,” to teach that the son who the father states is the firstborn will receive a double portion even of that property.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:3): If the court <b>had a presumption concerning</b> a son <b>that he is a firstborn, and his father said concerning another</b> son of his <b>that he is</b> his <b>firstborn,</b> the father’s statement is <b>deemed credible.</b> If the court <b>had a presumption concerning</b> a son <b>that he is not a firstborn, and his father said</b> that <b>he is</b> his <b>firstborn,</b> the father’s statement is <b>not deemed credible.</b>
The Gemara asserts that as the two <i>halakhot</i> of the <i>baraita</i> seem to contradict each other, it must be that <b>the first clause</b> represents the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, and the latter clause</b> represents the opinion of <b>the Rabbis.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that if one <b>says</b> about another: <b>He is my son, and then says: He is my slave,</b> his latter statement is <b>not deemed credible.</b> It cannot disqualify him from marrying a Jewish woman or exclude him from his inheritance. Conversely, if he first says: <b>He is my slave, and then says: He is my son,</b> his latter statement is <b>deemed credible, as</b> in his first statement he presumably <b>was saying: He serves me as a slave</b> does.
<b>And the opposite</b> <i>halakha</i> applies <b>to</b> one <b>at the tax house:</b> If one <b>is passing the customs house and says</b> about a certain person: <b>He is my son, and then</b> later <b>says: He is my slave,</b> his latter statement is <b>deemed credible,</b> as he presumably says that the other is his son only to evade paying a tax for possessing a slave. Conversely, if <b>he says</b> at the customs house: <b>He is my slave, and then</b> later <b>says: He is my son,</b> his latter statement is <b>not deemed credible,</b> as one would not unnecessarily render himself liable to pay a tax.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If one <b>was serving</b> another person <b>like a son</b> serves his father, <b>and</b> the person being served <b>came and said: He is my son, and then said: He is my slave,</b> his latter statement is <b>not deemed credible.</b> Additionally, if one <b>was serving</b> another person <b>like a slave</b> serves his master, <b>and</b> the one being served <b>came and said: He is my slave, and then said: He is my son,</b> his latter statement is <b>not deemed credible.</b> This contradicts Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that if he first says that he is his slave and then says that he is his son, his latter statement is deemed credible.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: There,</b> in Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, it is a case where he is presumed to be a slave <b>because</b> everyone <b>calls him: A slave</b> on whose <b>border [<i>metzar</i>]</b> are <b>one hundred.</b> Since everyone is referring to him in this manner, the person he served cannot call into question his status as a slave by saying that he is his son. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> does it mean that on his <b>border [<i>metzar</i>]</b> are <b>one hundred?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>One hundred dinars are adjacent to [<i>metzar</i>]</b> this <b>slave.</b> In other words, he is worth one hundred dinars.
§ <b>Rabbi Abba sent</b> several rulings from Eretz Yisrael <b>to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama,</b> including the following: In the case of <b>one who says to another: You stole my slave, and he says</b> in response: <b>I did not steal</b> him, and when the first inquires: If so, <b>what is the nature of his</b> presence <b>in your</b> possession, the latter responds: <b>You sold him to me,</b>

Daf 128a

or: <b>You gave him to me as a gift,</b> if he then adds: Although I owe you nothing, as the slave is mine, if it is <b>your desire, take an oath</b> that he is yours <b>and take</b> him; <b>and</b> the claimant <b>takes an oath</b> that the slave is his, the one in possession of the slave <b>cannot retract</b> his offer, although he was not obligated to make the offer.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Abba <b>teaching us? We</b> already <b>learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Sanhedrin</i> 24a) that if one of the litigants <b>said to</b> the other: My <b>father is trusted</b> to adjudicate <b>for me,</b> or: <b>Your father is trusted</b> to adjudicate <b>for me,</b> or: These <b>three cattle herders</b> who are not experts in <i>halakha</i> <b>are trusted</b> to adjudicate <b>for me,</b> and all of the individuals this litigant mentioned are legally disqualified from serving as judges, <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that the one who stated this <b>can retract</b> his statement, <b>and the Rabbis say</b> that <b>he cannot retract</b> it, and he is obligated to have them serve as judges if the other litigant so desires. Since this <i>halakha</i> is already stated in the mishna, what novel <i>halakha</i> did Rabbi Abba teach?
The Gemara in tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> records a dispute between <i>amora’im</i> as to the circumstances of the case of that mishna, with one <i>amora</i> holding that the dispute pertains only to a case where the one accepting the disqualified judge will need to forgive a debt if the judge rules in accordance with his opponent, while another <i>amora</i> holds that the dispute pertains even to a case where he will need to pay the other litigant if the judge rules in accordance with his opponent. By stating his ruling in a case where the litigant will have to give the slave to the other, Rabbi Abba <b>teaches us this, that the dispute</b> between Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis is even <b>in</b> a case where the litigant said: <b>I will give you</b> what you claim if that is the ruling of these judges, and the Rabbis hold that if he subsequently wishes to retract his suggestion, he cannot do so. <b>And</b> Rabbi Abba also teaches that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of the Rabbis.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Abba</b> also <b>sent</b> a ruling <b>to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that the creditors of one who died <b>collect</b> the debts <b>from the</b> Canaanite <b>slaves</b> the deceased left his heirs, i.e., they take the slaves, as slaves have the same status as land in this regard. <b>And Rav Naḥman says</b> that they <b>do not collect</b> the debt by taking the slaves.
§ <b>Rabbi Abba</b> also <b>sent</b> a ruling <b>to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama</b> that with regard to people with a common ancestor, the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that the testimony of members of the <b>third</b> generation <b>with regard to</b> members of the <b>second</b> generation whose closest familial connection is through that ancestor is <b>valid.</b> For example, one can testify about his first cousin once removed, and is not disqualified as a relative. <b>Rava says: Even</b> the testimony of members of the third generation <b>with regard to</b> members of the <b>first</b> generation is valid; e.g., one can testify about his great-uncle.
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi deemed</b> one’s testimony <b>with regard to</b> his <b>father’s father valid,</b> as he considered it a case of testimony of a member of the third generation with regard to a member of the first generation, which Rava deemed valid. <b>But the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Abba</b> also <b>sent</b> a ruling <b>to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama</b> concerning testimony: If one <b>knew</b> information that could serve as <b>testimony about</b> the boundary of another’s <b>land before he became blind, and</b> then he <b>became blind,</b> he is <b>disqualified</b> from bearing witness in a dispute as to the boundaries of that person’s properties.
<b>And Shmuel said: He is fit</b> to bear witness, as it is <b>possible</b> for him <b>to determine the boundaries</b> of the fields despite his blindness. <b>But</b> he is <b>not</b> fit to identify a movable item, e.g., <b>a cloak,</b> as he cannot see it. <b>And Rav Sheshet said:</b> He can identify <b>even a cloak,</b> as it is <b>possible</b> for him <b>to determine its length and its width. But</b> he is <b>not</b> fit to identify <b>a piece of silver. And Rav Pappa said:</b> He can identify <b>even a piece of silver,</b> as it is <b>possible</b> for him <b>to determine its weight.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Sanhedrin</i> 3:5): If one <b>knew</b> information that could serve as <b>testimony about</b> another <b>before he became his son-in-law, and</b> then <b>he became his son-in-law,</b> thereby becoming a relative who is disqualified from bearing witness concerning him; or if he was <b>able to hear</b> at the time he witnessed an incident <b>and</b> then <b>he became deaf;</b> or if he was <b>able to see</b> at the time he witnessed an incident <b>and</b> then <b>became blind;</b> or if he was halakhically <b>competent and</b> then <b>became insane,</b> in all these cases, he is <b>disqualified</b> from bearing witness.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>But</b> if <b>he knew</b> information <b>about him</b> that could serve as <b>testimony before he became his son-in-law, and</b> then <b>he became his son-in-law, and</b> then <b>his daughter died,</b> so that they are no longer related; or if he was <b>able to hear, and</b> then <b>became deaf, and</b> then <b>again became able to hear;</b> or if he was <b>able to see, and</b> then <b>became blind, and</b> then <b>again became able to see;</b> or if he was halakhically <b>competent, and</b> then <b>became insane, and</b> then <b>again became</b> halakhically <b>competent,</b> in all these cases, he is <b>fit</b> to bear witness.
The <i>baraita</i> concludes: <b>This is the principle: Anyone whose initial</b> state <b>or his ultimate</b> state, i.e., his state at the time of the incident or at the time of his testimony in court, <b>is</b> one of <b>disqualification</b> for bearing witness is <b>disqualified</b> from bearing witness. But any-one <b>whose initial</b> state <b>and his ultimate</b> state <b>is</b> one of <b>fitness</b> to bear witness is <b>fit</b> to bear witness, even if he was disqualified in the interim. This <i>baraita</i> clearly states that one who is blind is disqualified from bearing witness.

Daf 128b

The Gemara concludes: <b>The refutation</b> of the opinions <b>of all</b> the <i>amora’im</i> who held that a person who became blind after witnessing a matter can, in certain cases, testify about it, is indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Abba sent</b> another ruling <b>to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama: One who says</b> something <b>concerning</b> one <b>child among</b> his <b>sons</b> is <b>deemed credible, and Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>he is not deemed credible.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> Rabbi Abba <b>saying? Abaye said</b> that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Abba <b>is saying: One who says concerning</b> one <b>child among</b> his <b>sons: He shall inherit all my property,</b> is <b>deemed credible, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> who holds that one can bequeath all his property to one of his heirs (130a). <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>he is not deemed credible, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.
<b>Rava objects to this</b> explanation: According to Abaye’s explanation, <b>this</b> wording: Is <b>deemed credible, and: He is not deemed credible,</b> is not precise; <b>he should have</b> employed the terms: <b>Shall inherit, and: Shall not inherit,</b> as the issue is the ability of the father to specify who will inherit from him, not his credibility.
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> is what Rabbi Abba <b>is saying: One who says about</b> one <b>child among</b> his <b>sons</b> that <b>he is</b> his <b>firstborn</b> is <b>deemed credible, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> (127b); <b>and Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>he is not deemed credible, in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> who disagree with Rabbi Yehuda.
§ <b>Rabbi Abba sent</b> another ruling <b>to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama:</b> In a case of <b>one who says: My wife will take</b> a portion of my estate <b>like one of the sons, she takes</b> a portion <b>like one of the sons,</b> as it is considered a gift. <b>Rava says: And</b> this ruling is only <b>with regard to</b> the husband’s <b>current property,</b> which he can give her as a gift. The husband cannot give her a portion of his future property. <b>And</b> furthermore, the calculation of her portion must take into account not only the number of sons the husband has at the time of his statement, but also <b>the sons who come,</b> i.e., who will be born, <b>afterward.</b>
§ <b>Rabbi Abba sent</b> another ruling <b>to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama:</b> In the case of <b>one who produces a promissory note against another,</b> and <b>the creditor says: I was not repaid anything, and the debtor says: I repaid half</b> the debt, <b>and the witnesses testify that</b> the debtor <b>repaid the entire</b> debt, then <b>this</b> debtor <b>takes an oath</b> that he repaid half, as is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who admits to a part of a claim, and he is exempt from paying that half. <b>And</b> the creditor <b>collects</b> the second <b>half from unsold property; but not from liened</b> property that was sold after the loan, <b>as</b> the buyers can <b>say: We rely on the witnesses</b> that the debt was repaid in its entirety.
The Gemara compares this <i>halakha</i> to the case of a promissory note that states that the debtor owes the creditor: <i>Sela</i> coins, without stating how many. The creditor claims that he lent the debtor five <i>sela</i> and the debtor claims that he borrowed only three. Rabbi Akiva holds that since the wording of the promissory note indicates a minimum debt of two <i>sela</i>, and the creditor could not have collected the third <i>sela</i> without the debtor’s admission, the latter’s admission to a part of the claim cannot render him liable to take an oath. The Gemara states: <b>And even according to Rabbi Akiva, who says that</b> the debtor is not liable to take an oath, as with regard to the third <i>sela</i> his legal status <b>is</b> similar to that of <b>one who returns a lost item, this statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where there are no witnesses</b> to the loan. <b>But where there are witnesses,</b> as is the case in Rabbi Abba’s ruling, the debtor <b>fears</b> denying the entire debt. Therefore he is liable to take an oath that he repaid half, as one who admits to a part of the claim.
<b>Mar bar Rav Ashi objects to this: On the contrary; even according to Rabbi Shimon ben Elazar,</b> who disagrees with Rabbi Akiva and <b>says</b> that the debtor <b>is considered</b> one who <b>admits to a part of the claim, this statement</b> applies only in a case <b>where there are no witnesses who support him. But</b> here in the case of Rabbi Abba, <b>where there are witnesses who support him,</b> testifying that he repaid the entire debt, his legal status <b>is certainly</b> that of <b>one who returns a lost item,</b> and he does not need to take an oath that he repaid half.
§ <b>Mar Zutra taught in the name of Rav Shimi bar Ashi: The <i>halakha</i> in all these <i>halakhot</i></b> is <b>as Rabbi Abba sent to Rav Yosef bar Ḥama. Ravina said to Rav Ashi: What</b> about the statement with <b>which Rav Naḥman</b> disagreed, i.e., that a debt can be collected by taking the slaves the debtor left his heirs? Is the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with this ruling of Rabbi Abba as well, despite the principle that in monetary matters the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with Rav Naḥman’s opinion? Rav Ashi <b>said to him: We teach</b> a different tradition, that Rabbi Abba’s statement rules that a creditor <b>does not collect</b> the debt from the slaves the debtor left his heirs, <b>and</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said the same.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> then <b>what</b> possibility <b>does</b> Mar Zutra <b>exclude</b> in ruling that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with Rabbi Abba’s statement?

Daf 129a

<b>If</b> his statement is said <b>to exclude</b> the statement <b>of Rava</b> that the testimony of members of the third generation concerning members of the first generation is valid, this is difficult, as Rava’s statement is not in conflict with Rabbi Abba’s statement that the testimony of members of the third generation with regard to members of the second generation is valid; <b>it</b> merely <b>adds</b> to it. <b>If</b> it is said to exclude the opinion <b>of Mar bar Rav Ashi</b> that a grandfather can testify concerning his grandchild, this is also difficult, as it has already been established that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi. If</b> it is said <b>to exclude</b> the rulings <b>of Shmuel and Rav Sheshet and Rav Pappa,</b> that a person who became blind can testify about what he saw beforehand, this too is difficult, as their rulings <b>were refuted</b> based on a <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> Mar Zutra’s statement is said <b>to exclude</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> that one cannot testify that a specific one of his sons is his firstborn, <b>and</b> to exclude <b>the strong objection of Mar bar Rav Ashi</b> to the statement of Rabbi Abba with regard to a case where a debtor admitted to part of a claim and witnesses testified that he repaid the entire debt. Despite Mar bar Rav Ashi’s objection, the <i>halakha</i> is that the debtor is not liable to take an oath.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>one</b> on his deathbed <b>who apportions his property orally,</b> granting it to his sons as a gift, and he <b>increased</b> the portion given <b>to one</b> of his sons <b>and reduced</b> the portion given <b>to one</b> other son, or equated the portion of the firstborn to the portions of the other sons, his statement stands. But if he said that they will receive the property not as a gift but as an inheritance, he has said nothing. If he wrote in his will, whether at the beginning, or in the middle, or at the end, that he is granting them the property as a gift, his statement stands. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> where it is phrased as <b>a gift at the beginning? What are the circumstances</b> where it is phrased as a gift <b>in the middle? What are the circumstances</b> where it is phrased as a gift <b>at the end?</b>
<b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that where one on his deathbed instructed: <b>Such and such a field will be given to so-and-so and he will inherit it, this is</b> a case where it is phrased as <b>a gift at the beginning.</b> Where he instructed: <b>And he will inherit it and it will be given to him, this is</b> a case where it is phrased as <b>a gift at the end.</b> Where he instructed: <b>He will inherit it and it will be given to him and he will inherit it, this is</b> a case where it is phrased as <b>a gift in the middle.</b>
<b>And</b> the <i>halakha</i> that his statement is valid pertains <b>specifically</b> to a case where the two terms, giving and inheritance, are employed <b>with regard to one person and one field. But</b> if they are employed <b>with regard to one person and two fields,</b> e.g., if he says: Reuven will inherit this field and will be given that field, or <b>one field and two people,</b> e.g., Reuven will inherit half of this field and Shimon will be given the other half, the part that was phrased as inheritance does <b>not</b> take effect. Only the part that is phrased as a gift takes effect.
<b>Rabbi Elazar says: Even</b> in a case where the two terms are employed with regard to <b>one person and two fields,</b> or <b>one field and two people,</b> his instruction takes effect, as both terms were employed with regard to the same person or the same field. <b>But with regard to two fields and two people,</b> it does <b>not</b> take effect, as the two instructions are not connected to one another.
<b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, <b>he said</b> that if one on his deathbed said: <b>Such and such a field will be given to so-and-so, and so-and-so,</b> i.e., another person, <b>will inherit such and such a field,</b> i.e., another field, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that even the latter person, who was designated to inherit his field, has <b>acquired</b> it. <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> He has <b>not acquired</b> it.
<b>Abaye said to Ravin: You have lightened our</b> burden with <b>one</b> statement that you cited, <b>but you have made it difficult for us</b> with the other <b>one. Granted,</b> the contradiction <b>between</b> this statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar</b> that you cited and the previously cited statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar</b> is <b>not difficult. There,</b> in the previously cited statement, Rabbi Elazar said that the directive takes effect <b>with regard to</b> a case of <b>one person and two fields,</b> and <b>here</b> he said that the directive does not take effect <b>with regard to</b> a case of <b>two people and two fields.</b>
<b>But</b> the apparent contradiction <b>between</b> one statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> and the other statement <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> is <b>difficult,</b> as Rav Dimi cited in Rabbi Yoḥanan’s name that his directive takes effect only in a case of one person and one field, and according to your citation in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan it takes effect even in a case of two people and two fields.
Ravin answered him: Rav Dimi and I <b>are <i>amora’im</i>, and</b> we each have a different tradition <b>with regard to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan.</b>
Ravin continued: <b>And Reish Lakish says</b> that one has <b>not acquired</b> the field in the case of two people and two fields <b>unless</b> the giver <b>says: So-and-so and so-and-so will inherit such and such a field and such and such</b> a field <b>that I have given them as a gift, and they will inherit it.</b>
This dispute between the <i>amora’im</i> of Eretz Yisrael is also the subject <b>of a dispute</b> between the <i>amora’im</i> of Babylonia. <b>Rav Hamnuna says:</b> The mishna <b>taught</b> that when both giving and inheritance are mentioned one can increase the portion of one of his sons <b>only</b> with regard to a case of <b>one person and one field, but</b> with regard to <b>one person and two fields,</b> or <b>one field and two people,</b> it is <b>not</b> effective. <b>And Rav Naḥman says: Even</b> in a case of <b>one person and two fields,</b> or <b>one field and two people,</b> it is effective, <b>but</b> in a case of <b>two fields and two people,</b> it is <b>not. And Rav Sheshet says: Even</b> in a case of <b>two fields and two people,</b> it is effective.
<b>Rav Sheshet said: From where do I say this? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ketubot</i> 6:10): If a person on his deathbed, or <b>one who</b> is going overseas, <b>says</b> to his children’s steward: <b>Give a shekel to my children</b> every <b>week</b> for their needs, <b>and</b> this is a situation where, based on their needs, <b>they are fit</b> for the steward <b>to give them a <i>sela</i>,</b> i.e., double the amount, <b>he gives them a <i>sela</i>.</b> When the father mentioned a shekel, he presumably meant that the children should be given a sum in accordance with their actual requirements, not that specific amount. <b>But if he said: Give them only a shekel,</b> the steward <b>gives them only a shekel,</b> and no more. <b>And if he said: If</b> my children <b>die,</b>

Daf 129b

<b>others will inherit</b> their portion <b>in their stead,</b> then regardless of <b>whether he said: Give them</b> a shekel, or <b>whether he said: Do not give</b> them more than a shekel, the court <b>gives</b> his children <b>only a shekel</b> per week, so as not to reduce the share of the others, as their father clearly stated that he wishes to give his children only a specific stipend, and that he intends to leave the bulk of his property to others.
Rav Sheshet concludes: <b>And isn’t</b> the case <b>here like</b> a case of <b>two fields and two people,</b> as the father gave part of his property to his sons as a gift, and the rest to others as an inheritance? <b>But it is taught that</b> the others <b>acquire</b> the property, although he employed only the terminology of inheritance concerning them.
Rav Sheshet <b>raised the objection and he resolved it:</b> The term others is referring <b>to</b> those who are <b>fit to inherit</b> from <b>him; and</b> the ruling of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> who holds that one can bequeath his property to anyone who is fit to inherit from him. Therefore it is unnecessary for the bequest to be phrased as a gift.
<b>Rav Ashi said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof for the opinion of Rav Sheshet from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:4): If one states: <b>My property</b> will go <b>to you</b> after my death for your use during your lifetime, <b>and after you</b> die, <b>so-and-so will inherit</b> the property, <b>and after</b> the one who inherits <b>after you</b> dies, <b>so-and-so will inherit</b> the property, then in this case, when <b>the first</b> recipient <b>dies, the second acquires</b> it, and when <b>the second dies, the third acquires</b> it. <b>And if the second dies during the lifetime of the first, the property returns</b> after his death <b>to the heirs of the first,</b> and does not go to the third designated recipient, as his right was to inherit it from the second one, who never received it.
Rav Ashi states his proof: <b>And here it is</b> a case <b>like</b> that of <b>two fields and two people,</b> as the bequest to the first recipient was phrased as a gift, and to the second one it was phrased as inheritance; <b>and</b> yet the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches that</b> the second recipient <b>acquires</b> the property after the death of the first.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>here, too,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case where the recipient is <b>fit to inherit</b> from <b>him, and</b> it <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, if so,</b> why does it state that when <b>the second dies, the third acquires</b> it?
Rav Ashi explains his previous comment: <b>Didn’t Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, send</b> the following ruling <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka?</b> If a person on his deathbed said: <b>My property</b> is given <b>to you, and after you to so-and-so, and</b> the <b>first</b> recipient <b>was fit to inherit</b> from <b>him, the second gets nothing in place of the first,</b> i.e., he does not receive the property after the first one dies, <b>as this formulation</b> employed by the owner was <b>not</b> one <b>of a gift; rather,</b> it was <b>a formulation of inheritance, and inheritance has no end,</b> i.e., it cannot be stopped. Therefore, since the first recipient acquired it as inheritance, his heirs inherit it from him, and it cannot be taken by the second one. Therefore, the <i>baraita</i> is irreconcilable with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.
The Gemara affirms: <b>The refutation of</b> the opinions <b>of all</b> the Sages who disagree with the opinion of Rav Sheshet that even if one uses the two terms with regard to two fields and two people his gift to both people is effective, is <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Let us say that it is also a conclusive refutation</b> of the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish,</b> who maintains that giving must be mentioned with regard to both recipients and both fields. The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> how can <b>you understand</b> this? <b>But didn’t Rava say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Reish Lakish with regard to these three</b> issues: Acquisition of land for the rights to its produce, <i>ḥalitza</i> of a pregnant woman, and the matter of bequeathal phrased both as a gift and as inheritance?
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the case where giving can be mentioned concerning one of the recipients and inheritance with regard to the other, it is a case where the two bequests were stated <b>within</b> the time <b>required for speaking</b> a short phrase, i.e., the time it takes to greet one’s teacher. According to the <i>halakha</i>, within this time a speaker can retract his statement. Therefore both bequests are considered to be part of one statement. <b>There,</b> in the case where Reish Lakish maintains that giving must be mentioned with regard to both people for it to take effect, it is a case where the final part of the statement, where he said: And they will inherit it, was <b>after</b> the time required <b>for speaking</b> a short phrase.
<b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that the legal status of <b>any</b> statement interrupted or retracted <b>within</b> the time <b>required for speaking</b> a short phrase <b>is like</b> that of continuous <b>speech.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> in all cases, <b>apart from idol worship,</b> as one who accepts an idol as his god is liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment even if he retracts his statement within the time required for speaking a short phrase,

Daf 130a

<b>and betrothal,</b> as if a man betroths a woman and retracts the betrothal within the time required for speaking, his retraction is not effective.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case of <b>one who says: So-and-so will inherit</b> from <b>me, in a case where there is a daughter,</b> or: <b>My daughter will inherit</b> from <b>me, in a case where there is a son, he has said nothing, as he has stipulated counter to that which is written in the Torah</b> concerning the order of inheritance. <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says: If he said</b> this <b>about one fit to inherit</b> from <b>him, his statement stands, but</b> if it was <b>about one for whom</b> it was <b>not fit to inherit</b> from <b>him, his statement does not stand.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara infers from the mishna that <b>the reason</b> the first <i>tanna</i> rules that his bequeathal is invalid is <b>that</b> he bequeathed his estate to <b>another</b> in a case <b>where</b> he had <b>a daughter, or</b> to his <b>daughter where</b> he had <b>a son, but</b> if he bequeathed his entire estate to one <b>son among</b> his other <b>sons, or</b> to one <b>daughter among</b> his other <b>daughters, his statement stands.</b> The Gemara questions this inference: <b>Say the latter clause</b> of the mishna: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says</b> that <b>if he said</b> this <b>about one fit to inherit</b> from <b>him, his statement stands. This is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>.</b> What information does this statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka add? With regard to what case do they disagree?
The Gemara continues: <b>And if you would say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka is saying</b> that one’s statement stands <b>even</b> in a case where he bequeathed his estate to <b>another where</b> he had <b>a daughter or</b> to <b>a daughter where</b> he had <b>a son,</b> as although he bequeathed it to one who is not currently his heir, the beneficiary would be fit to inherit from him if the current heirs die, and this would be contrary to the opinion of the first <i>tanna</i>, this is difficult. <b>And isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 7:18) that <b>Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, says: My father and the Rabbis did not disagree about</b> a case where one bequeathed his estate to <b>another where</b> he had <b>a daughter or</b> to <b>a daughter where</b> he had <b>a son;</b> in a case such as this, my father concedes <b>that he has said nothing.</b>
Rabbi Yishmael continues: <b>With regard to what</b> case <b>do they disagree?</b> They disagree <b>with regard to</b> a case where he bequeathed his entire estate to one <b>son among</b> his other <b>sons, or</b> to one <b>daughter among</b> his other <b>daughters, as my father says</b> that the son or daughter <b>inherits</b> the entire estate, <b>and the Rabbis say</b> that <b>he does not inherit</b> it.
The Gemara explains: <b>If you wish, say</b> that <b>from</b> the fact <b>that</b> Rabbi Yishmael <b>is saying</b> that <b>they did not disagree</b> about a case where one bequeathed his estate to another where he had a daughter or to a daughter where he had a son, <b>by inference, the first <i>tanna</i></b> of that <i>baraita</i>, to whom he was responding, <b>holds</b> that <b>they</b> did <b>disagree</b> in this case.
And <b>if you wish, say</b> instead that the <b>entire</b> mishna <b>is</b> stating the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, and</b> the mishna <b>is incomplete, and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> With regard to <b>one who says: So-and-so will inherit</b> from <b>me,</b> in a case <b>where there is a daughter,</b> or: <b>My daughter will inherit</b> from <b>me,</b> in a case <b>where there is a son, he has said nothing, but</b> if he bequeathed his property to one <b>son among</b> his other <b>sons, or</b> one <b>daughter among</b> his other <b>daughters,</b> then <b>if he said</b> that the son or daughter <b>will inherit all his property, his statement stands, as Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> ben Beroka <b>says: If he said</b> this <b>about one fit to inherit him,</b> that he should inherit all of his property, <b>his statement stands.</b>
§ As for the halakhic ruling, <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. And Rava says as well</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.</b>
<b>Rava said: What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka? The verse states: “Then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:16), which is interpreted to mean that <b>the Torah gave the father permission to bequeath</b> his estate <b>to whomever he wishes</b> among his sons.
<b>Abaye said to him:</b> Isn’t <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>derived from</b> the continuation of the verse: <b>“He may not make</b> the son of the beloved <b>the firstborn,</b> before the son of the hated, who is the firstborn”? From the prohibition against depriving the firstborn of his double portion it can be inferred that one can change the apportionment of the inheritance of his other sons.
The Gemara answers: <b>That</b> clause in the verse is <b>necessary for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Ḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Eliezer:</b>

Daf 130b

<b>Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “He may not make</b> the son of the beloved <b>the firstborn”</b> (Deuteronomy 21:16)?
Abba Ḥanan explains: It is necessary <b>because</b> it <b>is stated</b> previously in the verse: <b>“Then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit,” as</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference,</b> as follows: <b>And if</b> with regard to <b>an ordinary</b> son, one who is not a firstborn, <b>whose power is enhanced</b> in <b>that he takes</b> in inheritance the property <b>due</b> the deceased <b>as</b> he does the property the deceased <b>possessed</b> at the time he died, nevertheless, <b>the Torah gave the father permission to bequeath</b> his estate <b>to whichever</b> of his sons <b>he wishes,</b> depriving his other sons of their portions, then with regard to <b>a firstborn, whose power is diminished</b> in <b>that he does not take</b> a double portion of the property <b>due</b> his father <b>as</b> he takes of the property the deceased <b>possessed</b> at the time of his death, is it <b>not</b> clear <b>all the more so</b> that his father can deprive him of the double portion he receives as a firstborn? Therefore, <b>the verse states: “He may not make</b> the son of the beloved <b>the firstborn.”</b>
Abba Ḥanan continues: <b>And let</b> the verse <b>state</b> only the prohibition of: <b>“He may not make</b> the son of the beloved <b>the firstborn.” Why</b> must <b>the verse state: “Then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit”?</b>
It is necessary <b>because</b> one <b>might</b> have thought: <b>Could this not</b> be derived through an <i>a fortiori</i> <b>inference,</b> as follows: <b>And if</b> with regard to <b>a firstborn, whose power is diminished</b> in <b>that he does not take</b> a double portion of the property <b>due</b> his father <b>as</b> he takes of the property the deceased <b>possessed,</b> nevertheless <b>the Torah states: “He may not make</b> the son of the beloved <b>the firstborn,”</b> i.e., the firstborn may not be deprived of his double portion, then with regard to <b>an ordinary</b> son, <b>whose power is enhanced</b> in <b>that he takes</b> in inheritance the property <b>due</b> the deceased <b>as</b> he does the property the deceased <b>possessed,</b> is it <b>not</b> clear <b>all the more so</b> that his father cannot deprive him of his portion of the inheritance?
Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons to inherit,”</b> indicating that <b>the Torah gave the father permission to bequeath</b> his estate <b>to whichever</b> of his sons <b>he wishes.</b> Consequently, the prohibition “he may not make the son of the beloved the firstborn” is not available to prove that one may bequeath his estate to whichever of his sons he wishes.
§ The Gemara resumes discussion of the halakhic ruling: <b>Rabbi Zerika says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ami says</b> that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka. Rabbi Abba said to</b> Rabbi Zerika: <b>It was stated</b> that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>ruled</b> in an actual case in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do they disagree?</b> Since both Rabbi Zerika and Rabbi Abba agree that the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, why did Rabbi Abba state that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi ruled as much in an actual case? The Gemara answers: One <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Zerika, <b>holds</b> that a ruling in principle is <b>a preferable</b> source for <b>a <i>halakha</i>,</b> rather than a ruling from an incident; <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Abba, <b>holds</b> that a specific <b>incident</b> ruled upon by <b>a Sage</b> is a preferable source.
The Gemara examines which source is preferable. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>One may derive</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> neither from a statement nor from an incident</b> where one saw a ruling issued in a certain manner, <b>unless</b> the Sages explicitly <b>tell him</b> that it is the <b>practical <i>halakha</i>.</b> If he <b>asked</b> the Sages <b>and they told him</b> the <b>practical <i>halakha</i>, he may go and act</b> upon the ruling in those circumstances, <b>provided that he does not compare</b> between cases and apply the ruling to other circumstances.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is the meaning of the statement: <b>Provided that he does not compare? But don’t we compare</b> cases throughout <b>the entire Torah?</b> The main method of halakhic derivation is through comparing cases where the <i>halakha</i> was already established to cases where the <i>halakha</i> is unclear.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Provided that he does not compare between</b> various cases of <b>animals with wounds that will cause them to die within twelve months [<i>tereifot</i>],</b> which are forbidden for consumption. In general, one may compare cases, but with regard to the definition of a <i>tereifa</i>, one may not compare.
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to <i>tereifot</i>, one does not say: This</b> wound <b>is similar to that</b> wound. Every type of wound has its own <i>halakhot</i>. <b>And do not wonder</b> about this principle, <b>as there are</b> organs with regard to which one <b>cuts it from here,</b> i.e., one side, <b>and</b> the animal <b>dies</b> within twelve months, but one <b>cuts it from there,</b> i.e., another side, <b>and it lives.</b>
<b>Rabbi Asi said to Rabbi Yoḥanan: When the Master,</b> i.e., Rabbi Yoḥanan, <b>says to us: This is</b> the <b><i>halakha</i>, should we act</b> upon the ruling? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said: Do not act</b> upon the ruling <b>unless I say</b> that it is <b>a practical <i>halakha</i>.</b>
<b>Rava said to Rav Pappa and to Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua: When a legal ruling of mine comes before you and you perceive a refutation of it, do not tear it up until you come before me</b> to discuss it. <b>If I have</b> a valid <b>explanation, I will tell you, and if not, I will retract</b> my ruling. If a ruling of mine comes before you <b>after</b> my <b>death,</b> when you can no longer discuss it with me, <b>do not tear it up, but do not learn from it either,</b> i.e., do not rule in accordance with it. <b>Do not tear it up, as had I been there, perhaps I would have told you</b> a valid <b>explanation</b> that you would have accepted;

Daf 131a

but <b>do not learn from it either, as a judge has only what his eyes see</b> as the basis for his ruling. One must rule according to his own understanding.
§ <b>Rava raises a dilemma: In</b> the case of <b>a healthy person</b> who bequeaths his estate to one of his sons, <b>how</b> should the court rule? Should it be reasoned that <b>when Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says</b> that the bequeathal is valid, he said so specifically <b>with regard to</b> the case of <b>a person on his deathbed, since he is capable of bequeathal,</b> as the verse: “In the day that he causes his sons to inherit” (Deuteronomy 21:16), from which the validity of this bequeathal is derived, is referring specifically to the time of one’s death; <b>but in</b> the case of <b>a healthy person,</b> he did <b>not</b> say his ruling? <b>Or perhaps</b> he stated his ruling <b>even in</b> the case of <b>a healthy person.</b>
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya said to Rava: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of your dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>, <b>as Rabbi Natan said to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>You taught</b> in <b>your Mishna in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 52b): If the husband <b>did not write for her</b> in her marriage contract: Any <b>male children you will have from me will inherit the money of your marriage contract in addition to their portion</b> of the inheritance <b>that</b> they receive together <b>with their brothers,</b> he <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>obligated</b> as though he had written it, <b>as it is a stipulation of the court</b> and consequently takes effect even if it is not explicitly stated. This mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka that one may add to the share of some of his sons at the expense of the others.
<b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to him:</b> We did not learn that the male children she has from him will inherit the money of the marriage contract; that version is not accurate. Rather, <b>we learned</b> that <b>they will take</b> the money of the marriage contract, as a gift. When a bequeathal is worded in this manner, it is valid in any event, as stated in the previous mishna (126b).
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi later retracted his response, and <b>said:</b> My response was because of <b>immaturity</b> that <b>I had in me, and I was insolent in the presence of</b> Rabbi <b>Natan the Babylonian</b> by responding in a manner that is incorrect. It is incorrect for the following reason: <b>But since we maintain</b> that concerning an obligation detailed in a marriage document ensuring inheritance rights of a woman’s <b>male children,</b> the beneficiaries <b>do not repossess liened</b> property that has been sold, one can infer that they do not receive the money as a gift. As, <b>if it enters your mind</b> that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>they will take</b> the money as a gift, <b>why don’t they repossess liened</b> property? The gift was given to them before the property was sold to others. <b>Rather, conclude from</b> this claim that <b>we learned</b> in the mishna that <b>they will inherit</b> the money.
Rav Mesharshiyya concludes: <b>Of whom have you heard that he holds this opinion</b> that one can add to the inheritance of some of his sons at the expense of the others? It is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, and conclude from</b> the mishna in <i>Ketubot</i> that his ruling applies <b>even with regard to a healthy person,</b> as one does not write a marriage contract on his deathbed. This resolves Rava’s dilemma.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Abaye:</b> How can one prove that the mishna in tractate <i>Ketubot</i> is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka? <b>Whether according to the one who says</b> that the correct version of the mishna is: <b>They will take, and whether according to the one who says</b> the correct version of the mishna is: <b>They will inherit,</b> the mishna is difficult, for the following reason: <b>A person cannot transfer ownership</b> of <b>an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world.</b> How can the husband confer rights to his property to children that have yet to be born?
Rav Pappa explains: <b>And even according to Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that <b>a person can transfer ownership</b> of <b>an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world, this statement</b> applies specifically in a case where he transfers the item <b>to an entity,</b> i.e., a person, <b>that is in the world; but</b> with regard to transferring ownership of an item <b>to an entity that is not</b> yet <b>in the world,</b> e.g., to his children that have yet to be born, this statement does <b>not</b> apply. Therefore, the ruling of the mishna is difficult according to all opinions.
Rav Pappa explains: <b>Rather,</b> evidently <b>a stipulation of the court is different.</b> Since this clause of the marriage contract was instituted by rabbinic ordinance, it is not subject to the standard <i>halakhot</i> of transferring property, and one can transfer ownership of an item to an entity that is not yet in the world. Accordingly, <b>here too,</b> with regard to the dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka and the Rabbis, <b>a stipulation of the court is different,</b> and even according to the Rabbis, who disagree with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, one can bequeath the money of his wife’s marriage contract to the male children she will have from him in any manner he chooses. Consequently, there is no proof that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.
Abaye <b>said to him:</b> The assertion that the mishna is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka is <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that it expresses</b> this bequeathal <b>with the wording: They will inherit,</b> as opposed to: They will take. This indicates that a person can normally apportion his inheritance to his sons in any manner he wishes, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka.
<b>Abaye then said: That which I said is not correct.</b> The expression: They will inherit, is appropriate even according to the Rabbis, who disagree with Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, <b>as we learned</b> in the continuation of that mishna that even if the husband <b>did not write for</b> his wife: Any <b>female children you will have from me will sit in my house and be sustained from my property until they are taken by men,</b> i.e., until they are married, he <b>is</b> nevertheless <b>obligated</b> as though he had written it, <b>as it</b> too <b>is a stipulation of the court.</b>
<b>And</b> since these two clauses are written adjacent to each other in the marriage contract, <b>it is</b> effectively a case where one bequeaths his estate to two people: <b>To this</b> one, the daughters, <b>as a gift, and to that</b> one, the sons, <b>as an inheritance. And</b> in <b>any</b> case where one bequeaths his estate <b>to this</b> person <b>as an inheritance and to that</b> person <b>as a gift, even the Rabbis concede</b> that the bequest is valid even if it is to people who are not his heirs, as it is considered a gift with regard to both recipients.
<b>Rav Naḥumi, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Ḥananya bar Minyumi, said to Abaye:</b>

Daf 131b

<b>From where</b> do you conclude <b>that</b> both clauses, the one for the benefit of the sons and the one for the benefit of the daughters, <b>were instituted by one court</b> and are therefore each read in light of the other? <b>Perhaps they were instituted by two</b> different <b>courts</b> and are unrelated to each other. Accordingly, the wording of the gift and the wording of the inheritance are not part of the same statement.
The Gemara answers: This possibility should <b>not enter your mind, as</b> the <b>former clause</b> of that mishna <b>teaches</b> (<i>Ketubot</i> 49a): A father is not obligated to provide his daughter’s sustenance. <b>This interpretation was interpreted</b> by <b>Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya before the Sages of the vineyard in Yavne:</b> Since the Sages instituted that after the father’s death, <b>the sons inherit</b> the sum of money specified in their mother’s marriage contract, <b>and the daughters are sustained</b> from their father’s estate, these two <i>halakhot</i> are equated: <b>Just as the sons inherit only after their father’s death,</b> not during his lifetime, <b>so too, the daughters are sustained</b> from their father’s property <b>only after their father’s death.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the two clauses <b>were instituted by one court, this is</b> the reason <b>that we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of one <b>ordinance from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the other <b>ordinance,</b> under the assumption that a court institutes ordinances in a consistent manner. <b>But if you say</b> that they <b>were instituted by two</b> distinct <b>courts</b> operating in different periods, <b>how can we derive</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of one <b>ordinance from</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of the other <b>ordinance?</b>
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>From where</b> is it assumed that they were instituted by one court? <b>Actually, I will say to you</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the two clauses <b>were instituted by two</b> separate <b>courts, and</b> nevertheless Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya derived the <i>halakhot</i> of one ordinance from the <i>halakhot</i> of the other ordinance, because <b>the latter court</b> presumably <b>instituted</b> its ordinance <b>in accordance with</b> the format of <b>the former court, so that</b> one should <b>not ask</b> about contradictions between one <b>ordinance and</b> the other <b>ordinance.</b> With regard to the <i>halakhot</i> of inheritance, there is no reason to read the two clauses in light of the other.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> A person on his deathbed <b>who writes</b> a document granting <b>all his property to his wife has merely rendered her a steward.</b> The assumption is that he did not intend to deprive his heirs of their entire inheritance. Rather, he intended to appoint her as a steward in charge of the property, so that the heirs will honor her.
The Gemara discusses similar cases: It is <b>obvious</b> that if one writes a document granting all his property to <b>his adult son,</b> he does not intend to give him the entire inheritance, but to have him distribute it among his brothers. Rather, <b>he has merely rendered him a steward [<i>apotropos</i>].</b> If he writes it to <b>his minor son, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it still assumed that his intention is to appoint him as a steward, or is that implausible since a minor boy is not yet capable of assuming this position and therefore the father apparently intended to bequeath to him the entire inheritance?
It <b>was stated</b> that <b>Rav Ḥanilai bar Idi</b> says that <b>Shmuel says</b> that <b>even</b> if one wrote a document granting all his property to <b>his minor son who is lying in</b> his <b>crib,</b> he does not receive the entire inheritance. Rather, the father presumably intended to appoint him as a steward when he reached adulthood, so that the other heirs would honor him.
The Gemara states: It is <b>obvious</b> that if one wrote a document granting all his property to <b>his son and another</b> person, he intended to give <b>the other</b> person half the property <b>as a gift, and</b> to appoint <b>his son a steward</b> to oversee the property of his brothers, with whom he shares the other half. Similarly, if he wrote a document granting all his property to <b>his wife and another</b> person, he intended to give <b>the other</b> person half the property <b>as a gift, and</b> to appoint <b>his wife a steward</b> to oversee the other half of the property for his sons.
Furthermore, it is obvious that if one wrote a document granting all his property to <b>his betrothed wife,</b> whom he did not yet wed, <b>or</b> to <b>his</b> former <b>wife,</b> whom he had <b>divorced,</b> he intended to give it to them <b>as a gift,</b> as he had no reason to have his heirs honor them.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If one wrote a document granting all his property to his <b>daughter before</b> his <b>sons,</b> in a case where he has sons who would inherit from him, <b>or</b> to his <b>wife before</b> his <b>brothers, or</b> to his <b>wife before the husband’s sons</b> who are not her sons, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it assumed that his intention was to appoint her as a steward or to give her the property as a gift?
<b>Ravina said in the name of Rava</b> that <b>in all of</b> these cases the recipient <b>did not acquire</b> the property. Rather, he or she was merely appointed a steward, <b>except for</b> the cases of <b>his betrothed wife and his</b> former <b>wife</b> whom he <b>divorced.</b> By contrast, <b>Rav Avira said in the name of Rava</b> that <b>in all of</b> these cases the recipient <b>acquired</b> the property, <b>except for</b> the cases of his <b>wife before</b> his <b>brothers and</b> his <b>wife before the husband’s sons,</b> where he clearly intended only to appoint her as a steward.

Daf 132a

With regard to the <i>halakha</i> that a person on his deathbed who wrote a document granting all his property to his wife has appointed her as a steward, <b>Rava raises a dilemma: In</b> the case of <b>a healthy person, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Should it be reasoned that specifically <b>in</b> the case of <b>a person on his deathbed it</b> is assumed that he intended to appoint his wife as a steward, <b>as it is preferable for him that her word be heard</b> and she is honored after his death, <b>but in</b> the case of <b>a healthy person, he is</b> still <b>standing</b> and can ensure that his wife is honored, so he apparently intended to actually give her all of his property? <b>Or perhaps</b> should it be reasoned that <b>in</b> the case of <b>a healthy person as well, it is preferable that</b> his wife’s <b>word be heard</b> and she be given honor <b>from now?</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a resolution of the dilemma from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>one writes</b> a document that <b>the profits of his property</b> should go <b>to his wife</b> in the event that he dies or divorces her, <b>she collects</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract,</b> which he wrote her at the time of their marriage, <b>from the land</b> itself. The profits are hers as a result of his gift. Similarly, if he wrote a document granting her <b>one-half, one-third, or one-quarter</b> of his property, <b>she collects</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract from the rest</b> of his property, which he did not give her as a separate gift.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If one <b>wrote</b> a document granting <b>all his property to his wife, and</b> subsequently <b>a promissory note emerged against him</b> for a loan he took while they were married but before he gave her this gift, <b>Rabbi Eliezer says</b> that <b>she</b> should <b>tear up her</b> deed of <b>gift and remain with her marriage contract,</b> so that the creditor will not be able to collect the property she received, as her marriage contract preceded the promissory note. <b>And the Rabbis say: She</b> must <b>tear up her marriage contract and remain with her</b> deed of <b>gift,</b> as by accepting the gift of all her husband’s property she waived her right to receive payment of her marriage contract. Since the promissory note preceded the deed of gift, the creditor receives the property, <b>and</b> the wife <b>is found</b> to be <b>bald from here and from there,</b> i.e., she receives neither her gift nor her marriage contract.
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda the baker said:</b> There was <b>an incident where</b> this <b>matter occurred to my sister’s daughter</b> who is my <b>daughter-in-law [<i>kalla</i>],</b> that my son wrote such a document to her, <b>and the incident came before the Sages. And they said</b> that <b>she</b> must <b>tear up her marriage contract and remain with her</b> deed of <b>gift, and she is found</b> to be <b>bald from here and from there.</b>
The Gemara infers: <b>The reason</b> she loses her gift <b>is that a promissory note emerged against him, but if a promissory note did not emerge against him, she acquires</b> the gift of his property. <b>And with regard to what</b> case is this stated? <b>If we say</b> it is <b>with regard to a person on his deathbed, but didn’t you say</b> previously that in such a case <b>he merely rendered her a steward? Rather, is it not with regard to a healthy person?</b> Accordingly, Rava’s dilemma is resolved: If a healthy person writes a document granting all his property to his wife, it is hers.
The Gemara rejects this proof: <b>Actually,</b> the <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to a person on his deathbed; and Rav Avira would interpret</b> the <i>baraita</i> as referring <b>to all of</b> the cases mentioned above in which, in his opinion, the wife acquires the property and is not appointed as a steward. And <b>Ravina would interpret</b> it specifically <b>in reference to</b> a case where one wrote a document granting all his property to <b>his betrothed wife or his</b> former <b>wife, whom he divorced,</b> where he concedes that she acquires the property.
<b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis. <b>She</b> must <b>tear up her marriage contract and remain with her</b> deed of <b>gift, and she is found</b> to be <b>bald from here and from there.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Rav Naḥman does not follow</b> the principle of <b>assessing</b> intention, meaning that even if one did not state something explicitly, the court assesses what his intention was and decides the <i>halakha</i> based on that assessment? Clearly, upon accepting the gift the wife did not intend to waive payment of her marriage contract and thereby be left with nothing in the event that her husband’s creditor produces a promissory note that predates her gift.
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ketubot</i> 5:9): In a case <b>where one’s son went overseas and he heard that his son died, and</b> then he <b>arose and wrote</b> a document granting <b>all his property to others, and then his son came</b> back, <b>his gift</b> to the other people <b>is</b> a valid <b>gift. Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: His gift is not</b> a valid <b>gift, as had he known that his son</b> was <b>alive he would not have written</b> a document granting <b>them</b> his property. <b>And Rav Naḥman says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya.</b> Apparently, Rav Naḥman follows the principle of assessing intention.
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of one who writes a document granting all his property to his wife, it <b>is different, as</b> it is <b>beneficial to her that it be publicized that he wrote</b> a document granting <b>her</b> all of <b>that property,</b> and she was willing to risk not receiving payment of her marriage contract to gain this benefit.
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>there</b> (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:7): If a man <b>writes</b> a document granting <b>his property to his sons, and he wrote</b> a document granting <b>any amount of land to his wife, she has lost</b> her right to receive payment of <b>her marriage contract.</b> The Gemara questions this: <b>Because he wrote</b> a document granting <b>her any amount of land, she has lost</b> her right to receive payment of <b>her marriage contract?</b> Why should this be?
<b>Rav says:</b> This mishna is referring <b>to</b> a case where the husband <b>transfers ownership</b> of his property <b>to</b> his sons <b>through</b> his wife’s participation in a formal act of acquisition. Not only did she not protest the transfer of property to the sons, but she facilitated the transaction. Clearly, she agreed to waive payment of her marriage contract. <b>And Shmuel says:</b> It is referring not only to a case where she actually participates in the act of acquisition, but also <b>to</b> a case where he <b>distributes</b> the property to his sons <b>in her presence, and she is silent</b> and does not ask about her marriage contract. <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, says:</b> It is referring <b>to</b> a case where <b>he says to her: Take</b> only <b>this</b> parcel of <b>land for your marriage contract.</b>

Daf 132b

<b>And</b> the Sages <b>taught here</b> one <b>of the leniencies</b> that apply to <b>a marriage contract.</b> This manner in which the wife loses her right to receive payment of her marriage contract is a leniency for the husband, as an ordinary creditor does not lose money he is owed in this fashion.
The Gemara questions this statement: <b>We learned</b> in the same mishna that <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <b>if she accepted</b> the distribution <b>upon herself, even if he did not write</b> a document granting <b>her</b> any amount of land, <b>she has lost</b> her right to receive payment of <b>her marriage contract. By inference,</b> it can be stated <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that both his <b>writing</b> a document granting her a piece of land <b>and</b> her <b>acceptance</b> of the distribution <b>are necessary</b> for her to lose her right, contrary to the interpretation of all three <i>amora’im</i>, i.e., Rav, Shmuel, and Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, all of whom assumed that she need not affirmatively accept the distribution and that her silence is sufficient.
<b>And if you would say</b> that <b>the entire</b> mishna <b>is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> who holds that either the husband’s writing a deed of gift or the wife’s acceptance of the distribution is sufficient, <b>but isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that <b>Rabbi Yehuda said:</b> According to the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>when</b> does she lose her right to receive payment of her marriage contract? In a case <b>where she was there</b> at the time of the distribution <b>and accepted</b> it; <b>but if she was there but did not accept</b> it, or <b>accepted</b> it <b>but was not there, she has not lost</b> her right to receive payment of <b>her marriage contract,</b> as she can claim that her acquiescence was only to please her husband and was not sincere. The Gemara concludes: The <b>refutation</b> of the opinions <b>of all</b> the interpretations of the <i>amora’im</i> <b>is</b> indeed <b>a conclusive refutation.</b>
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: This</b> is the opinion of <b>Rav; this</b> is the opinion of <b>Shmuel;</b> and <b>this</b> is the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina. What does the Master hold</b> in this matter? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: As I say, that once he rendered her a partner</b> in the property <b>among the sons, she lost</b> her right to receive payment of <b>her marriage contract.</b>
Rav Naḥman’s opinion <b>was also stated</b> as a halakhic ruling: <b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>once he rendered her a partner</b> in the property <b>among the sons, she lost</b> her right to receive payment of <b>her marriage contract.</b>
<b>Rava raises a dilemma: In</b> the case of <b>a healthy person, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that the wife loses her right to receive payment of her marriage contract only <b>in</b> the case of <b>a person on his deathbed, as she knew that he had no</b> other property <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>waived</b> payment of the marriage contract, <b>but in</b> the case of <b>a healthy person, she</b> might have <b>reasoned</b> that <b>he will then acquire</b> other property from which she will be able to collect payment of her marriage contract, and that is why she accepted the distribution of the property? If so, she did not waive her right to receive payment of her marriage contract. <b>Or perhaps,</b> should it be reasoned that since <b>in any event, now he has no</b> other property, her acceptance should be interpreted as waiving her right? The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ There was <b>a certain</b> man on his deathbed <b>who said to</b> the people surrounding him: Give <b>one-half</b> of my estate <b>to</b> my <b>daughter, and one-half to</b> my other <b>daughter, and one-third of the produce to</b> my <b>wife. Rav Naḥman happened</b> to come <b>to Sura. He entered</b> the study hall <b>to</b> see <b>Rav Ḥisda,</b> who <b>said to him:</b> In <b>a case like this, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>Shmuel says: Even</b> if <b>he transferred to her</b> ownership <b>only one palm tree for its produce, she has lost</b> her right to receive payment of <b>her marriage contract.</b>
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: Say that Shmuel said</b> his statement that she loses her right <b>there,</b> in a case where he gave her a palm tree for its produce, <b>because he transferred</b> rights <b>in the land itself to her ownership,</b> as the palm tree is connected to the ground. But <b>here,</b> in this case, <b>it is</b> only <b>produce</b> that he gave her, without any share in the land itself. Perhaps she does not lose payment of her marriage contract. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: You say</b> that he gave her only <b>movable property? I certainly did not</b> mean to <b>say</b> that she loses her right even if he gave her only <b>movable property</b> such as produce. Rather, she receives payment of her marriage contract.
There was <b>a certain</b> man on his deathbed <b>who said to</b> the people surrounding him: Give <b>one-third</b> of my property <b>to</b> my <b>daughter, and one-third to</b> my other <b>daughter, and one-third to</b> my <b>wife. One of his daughters died</b> before he did, and her portion consequently returned to his possession. <b>Rav Pappi thought to say</b> that the wife <b>takes only one-third.</b> She cannot receive payment of her marriage contract from the two-thirds bequeathed to the daughters, as by entering a partnership with the daughters in ownership of the property, she waived payment of her marriage contract.

Daf 133a

<b>Rav Kahana said to him: If</b> the husband had <b>then acquired</b> other property, <b>would she not have taken</b> it as payment of her marriage contract? <b>And since if he</b> would have <b>then acquired</b> other property <b>she would have taken</b> it as payment of her marriage contract, <b>now she also takes</b> the deceased daughter’s share as payment of her marriage contract.
There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who divided his property between his wife and his son, leaving</b> out a <b>single palm tree. Ravina thought to say</b> that the wife <b>has only</b> the <b>single palm tree</b> as future payment of her marriage contract, which was presumably left out of the distribution for this reason. <b>Rav Yeimar said to Ravina: If she does not have</b> the right to collect payment of her marriage contract from all of his property, as she presumably waived that right when he gave her the gift of some of his property, <b>she does not have</b> the right to collect it from the <b>single palm tree either</b> and it belongs to the heirs. Rav Yeimar presents a different ruling: <b>Rather, since</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>she</b> does <b>descend to</b> collect the <b>palm tree, she</b> therefore <b>descends to</b> collect <b>all of the property as well,</b> i.e., she receives payment of her marriage contract from all the property.
§ <b>Rav Huna says:</b> With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who wrote</b> a document granting <b>all his property to another,</b> the court <b>investigates</b> the legal status of the recipient: <b>If he is fit to inherit</b> from <b>him,</b> e.g., if he is one of his sons, <b>he takes</b> the property <b>as an inheritance, and if not, he takes it as a gift.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman said to him: Why should you steal</b> this <i>halakha</i> and not attribute it to its source? <b>If you hold in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, say</b> explicitly that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, as your halakhic statement follows</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka</b> that a person can bequeath his property to any of his heirs.
<b>Perhaps this is what you</b> meant to <b>say: There was a certain</b> childless person <b>who was dying, and</b> those around him <b>said to him: To whom should his,</b> i.e., your, <b>property</b> be given? <b>Perhaps</b> it should be given <b>to so-and-so? And he said to them: Rather, to whom</b> if not him? <b>And you,</b> Rav Huna, meant to <b>say to us: If</b> that person <b>is fit to inherit</b> from <b>him, he takes it as an inheritance, and if not, he takes it as a gift.</b> Rav Huna <b>said to him: Yes, that is what I was saying.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is there a difference whether he receives it as an inheritance or as a gift? <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava,</b> who was <b>in the presence of Rava, thought</b> that it would be correct <b>to say: If he is fit to inherit</b> from <b>him,</b> the giver’s <b>widow is sustained from his property,</b> as she has the right to be sustained from the inheritance; <b>and if not,</b> and the property was given as a gift, <b>his widow is not sustained from his property.</b>
<b>Rava said to him:</b> Can the widow’s right be <b>diminished</b> by the gift? <b>Now</b> that <b>you say with regard to inheritance,</b> which is granted <b>by Torah law,</b> that <b>his widow is sustained from his property, with regard to</b> the <b>gift</b> of a person on his deathbed, which is effective without any formal act of acquisition <b>by rabbinic law, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that the widow has sustenance rights?
<b>Rather, Rava said</b> that the difference whether it is inheritance or a gift is <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling that <b>Rav Aḥa bar Rav Avya sent: According to the statement of Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> in the case of one who said: <b>My property</b> is given <b>to you, and after you to so-and-so, and the first</b> recipient <b>was fit to inherit</b> from <b>him, the second gets nothing in place of the first,</b> i.e., he does not receive the property after the first one dies, <b>as this formulation</b> employed by the owner was <b>not</b> one <b>of a gift. Rather,</b> it was <b>a formulation of inheritance, and inheritance has no end,</b> i.e., it cannot be stopped. Therefore, since the first recipient acquired it as an inheritance, his heirs inherit it from him, and it cannot be taken by the second.
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: But he ended it.</b> The one who bequeathed it to him ended his inheritance in advance by stating that after the first dies, the property will be given to the second. The Gemara answers: <b>He thought</b> that inheritance <b>has an end; but the Merciful One states</b> that <b>it has no end.</b>

Daf 133b

There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: My property</b> is given <b>to you, and after you, to so-and-so, and the first one was fit to inherit</b> from <b>him.</b> After <b>the first died, the second came and claimed</b> the property.
<b>Rav Ilish,</b> who was <b>in the presence of Rava, thought to say</b> that <b>the second also takes</b> a share of the property; he divides it with the heirs of the first. Rava <b>said to him: Judges of compromise,</b> who as a matter of course divide disputed property between the parties, <b>rule in this manner.</b> But <b>isn’t this</b> identical to the case concerning <b>which Rav Aḥa bar Rav Avya sent</b> a ruling that the second receives nothing?
Rav Ilish <b>was embarrassed</b> by his mistake. To comfort him, Rav <b>read</b> the following verse <b>about him: “I, the Lord, will hasten it in its time”</b> (Isaiah 60:22), as if to say: It was due to Divine Providence that I was here to correct you before your mistaken ruling was implemented.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who wrote</b> a document granting <b>his property to others</b> as a gift <b>and left his sons</b> with nothing, <b>what he did is done,</b> i.e., it takes effect; <b>but the Sages are displeased with him. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If</b> he did so because <b>his sons were not acting properly, he is remembered positively.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>Do the Rabbis disagree with Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> maintaining that depriving one’s children of their inheritance is inappropriate in any event, <b>or not?</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Yosef ben Yo’ezer had a son who was not acting properly.</b> Yosef ben Yo’ezer <b>had a vessel [<i>illiyyata</i>]</b> full <b>of dinars,</b> and <b>he arose and consecrated it</b> to the Temple treasury, depriving his son of his inheritance. His son <b>went and married the daughter of King Yannai’s crown weaver.</b> After the son’s <b>wife gave birth, he bought her a fish [<i>binita</i>]. He tore its</b> stomach open and <b>found a pearl in it.</b> He decided to sell it.
His wife <b>said to him: Do not bring it to</b> the treasury of <b>the king</b> to sell it, <b>as they will take it from you for an insignificant</b> sum of <b>money.</b> Rather, <b>go bring it to the</b> Temple <b>treasurers. And do not appraise it yourself, as declaration to the Most High is equivalent to transfer to an ordinary</b> person, and if you offer to sell it for an amount less than its worth, you will not be able to change your mind. <b>Rather, let them appraise it.</b>
<b>He brought it</b> to the Temple treasury, and <b>they appraised it as</b> having the value of <b>thirteen vessels [<i>illiyyata</i>]</b> full <b>of dinars.</b> The treasurers <b>said to him: There are seven</b> <i>illiyyata</i> of dinars at our disposal to pay you for the pearl, but <b>there are not</b> an additional <b>six. He said to</b> the treasurers: <b>Give me</b> the <b>seven</b> in exchange for the pearl, and as for the additional <b>six</b> that you owe me, <b>they are hereby consecrated to Heaven.</b>
The treasurers <b>arose and wrote: Yosef ben Yo’ezer bestowed one</b> <i>illiyyata</i> to the Temple treasury, <b>and his son bestowed six. And there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that they wrote: <b>Yosef ben Yo’ezer bestowed one</b> <i>illiyyata</i> to the Temple treasury, <b>and his son removed seven,</b> which he received for the pearl.
The Gemara infers: <b>From</b> the fact <b>that they said</b> approvingly that Yosef ben Yo’ezer’s son <b>bestowed</b> six, <b>by inference, he acted well</b> when he left him out of his inheritance. The Gemara responds: <b>On the contrary; from</b> the fact <b>that</b> according to the second account, <b>they said</b> disparagingly that he <b>removed</b> seven, <b>by inference,</b> Yosef ben Yo’ezer <b>did not act well</b> when he left him out of his inheritance, as he caused money to be removed from the Temple treasury. <b>Rather, no</b> inference is <b>to be learned from this</b> story with regard to the dilemma as to whether the Rabbis agree with the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as the two accounts contradict each other on this matter.
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Shmuel said to Rav Yehuda: <i>Shinnana</i>, do not be in a house where inheritance is transferred</b> away from its rightful heir, <b>even</b> if it is transferred <b>from a wicked son to a good son, and all the more so</b> if it is transferred <b>from a son to a daughter.</b> Evidently, the Rabbis hold that inheritance should not be transferred in any case.
§ <b>The Sages taught:</b> There was <b>an incident involving one man whose children did not act properly. He arose and wrote</b> a document transferring all <b>his property to Yonatan ben Uzziel,</b> one of the Sages, as a gift. <b>What did Yonatan ben Uzziel do? He sold a third</b> of the property for his needs, <b>and consecrated a third</b> of the property, <b>and returned</b> the remaining <b>third to</b> the man’s <b>children.</b>
<b>Shammai came to</b> Yonatan ben Uzziel <b>with his staff and traveling bag</b> to protest his giving part of the property to the man’s children against the deceased’s wishes. Yonatan ben Uzziel <b>said to him: Shammai, if you can repossess</b> the property <b>that I sold</b> from the purchasers <b>and</b> the property <b>that I consecrated</b> from the Temple treasury, <b>you can repossess what I returned</b> to the man’s children as well;

Daf 134a

but <b>if not,</b> as the property is mine and I have the right to do with it whatever I want, <b>you cannot repossess what I returned</b> to the man’s children either. Shammai then <b>said: Ben Uzziel reprimanded me; ben Uzziel reprimanded me,</b> and I have no response.
The Gemara asks: <b>What did</b> Shammai <b>hold initially,</b> causing him to protest Yonatan ben Uzziel’s behavior? The Gemara answers: He protested <b>due to the incident</b> that happened <b>in</b> the city of <b>Beit Ḥoron.</b>
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nedarim</i> 48a): <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>involving someone in</b> the city of <b>Beit Ḥoron whose father had vowed not to derive benefit from him, and</b> the son <b>was marrying off his</b> own <b>son</b> and wanted his father to be able to participate in the wedding meal. <b>And</b> he therefore <b>said to another:</b> The <b>courtyard</b> where the wedding will take place <b>and</b> the wedding <b>meal are hereby given to you as a gift, but they are</b> given <b>to you only so that my father will come and eat with us at the meal.</b> The son wanted to circumvent the prohibition imposed by the vow and enable his father to participate in the meal, so he transferred ownership to someone else for that purpose.
The recipient <b>said to him: If they are mine, they are</b> all <b>hereby consecrated to Heaven,</b> i.e., the Temple, and are forbidden to everyone. The son <b>said to him</b> in anger: <b>I did not give you my</b> property <b>so that you should consecrate them to Heaven.</b> The recipient <b>said to him: You gave me your</b> property <b>only</b> so <b>that you and your father would eat and drink and</b> thereby <b>appease each other, and the sin</b> of transgressing the vow would <b>be hung on his,</b> i.e., my, <b>head,</b> as I enabled the transgression.
The mishna continues: In reference to this incident, <b>the Sages said: Any gift that is not</b> so absolute <b>that if</b> the recipient <b>were to consecrate it,</b> the gift <b>would be consecrated, is not a gift.</b> In other words, in order for it to be a gift the recipient must have the ability to consecrate it. Similarly, Shammai had initially reasoned that the gift to Yonatan ben Uzziel was not a valid gift, as its sole purpose was so that the property should not fall into the possession of the man’s children. Once he discovered that Yonatan ben Uzziel consecrated part of the gift, he realized that it was, in fact, a valid gift, with which the recipient could do whatever he pleased.
§ Apropos Yonatan ben Uzziel, the Gemara cites that <b>the Sages taught: Hillel the Elder had eighty students. Thirty of them</b> were sufficiently <b>worthy that the Divine Presence should rest upon them as</b> it did upon <b>Moses our teacher, thirty of them</b> were sufficiently <b>worthy that the sun should stand still for them as</b> it did for <b>Joshua bin Nun,</b> and <b>twenty</b> were on <b>an intermediate</b> level between the other two. <b>The greatest of all</b> the students was <b>Yonatan ben Uzziel, and the least of them</b> was <b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai.</b>
The Sages <b>said about Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai</b> that <b>he did not neglect Bible and Mishna; Talmud; <i>halakhot</i> and <i>aggadot</i>; minutiae of the Torah and minutiae of the scribes; and</b> the hermeneutical principles of the Torah with regard to <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> inferences; <b>and verbal analogies; and</b> the calculation of the calendric <b>seasons; and numerical values</b> of Hebrew letters <b>[<i>gimatriyot</i>]; and parables of launderers,</b> which are folktales that can be used to explain the Torah, <b>and parables of foxes.</b> In addition, he did not neglect esoteric matters, including <b>the conversation of demons, and the conversation of palm trees, and the conversation of ministering angels, and</b> more generally, <b>a great matter and a small matter.</b>
The Gemara elaborates: <b>A great matter is</b> referring to the secrets of <b>the Design of the</b> Divine <b>Chariot</b> (see Ezekiel, chapter 1), the conduct of the transcendent universe, <b>and a small matter is,</b> for example, <i>halakhot</i> that were ultimately formulated in the framework of <b>the discussions of Abaye and Rava.</b> He did not neglect any of these disciplines, so as <b>to fulfill that</b> which <b>is stated: “That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance and that I may fill their treasuries”</b> (Proverbs 8:21), as Rabban Yoḥanan was filled with the disciplines of Torah and wisdom.
The Gemara adds: <b>And if the least of them</b> was <b>so</b> prolific, <b>the greatest of them</b> was <b>all the more so</b> prolific. The Gemara relates that the Sages <b>said of Yonatan ben Uzziel,</b> the greatest of Hillel’s students, that <b>when he would sit and engage in Torah</b> study, the sanctity that he generated was so intense that <b>any bird that would fly over him would be incinerated.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who says: This is my son,</b> is <b>deemed credible.</b> One who says: <b>This is my brother,</b> is <b>not deemed credible</b> with regard to his other brothers’ obligation to share the inheritance with the subject of his statement. When one claims that this man is his brother, this claim is accepted with regard to the speaker’s own portion, <b>and</b> the man in question <b>takes</b> a share of their father’s inheritance <b>with him,</b> i.e., <b>from his portion.</b>
If the man in question <b>dies,</b> the <b>property</b> he received from the father’s inheritance <b>shall return to its place,</b> i.e., to the possession of the brother who testified on his behalf, from whose portion he received a share.
If <b>property came into</b> the man in question’s possession <b>from somewhere else,</b> other than from the father, and the man in question died, all of <b>the brothers of</b> the one who testified <b>shall inherit with</b> the one who testified, as according to his claim they too are the heirs of the deceased.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that one who says: <b>This is my son,</b> is <b>deemed credible. With regard to what <i>halakha</i></b> is this stated? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> It is stated <b>with regard to inheriting</b> from <b>him,</b> i.e., the son inherits from the speaker, <b>and with regard to rendering his wife exempt from levirate marriage.</b> Because he claims that the person in question is his son, his wife is not required to enter into levirate marriage after his death, as he has a child.

Daf 134b

The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that his claim is deemed credible <b>with regard to</b> someone <b>inheriting</b> from <b>him?</b> Since he could have given this person his property as a gift, it need not be stated that his claim is accepted with regard to his inheritance. The Gemara responds: <b>It was necessary for</b> the mishna to state that his claim is deemed credible <b>with regard to rendering his wife exempt from levirate marriage</b> despite the fact that it is not in his power to render her exempt, but the <i>halakha</i> of inheritance is not a novelty.
The Gemara asks: <b>We</b> already <b>learned this</b> in a mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 64a) <b>as well: One who said at the time of his death: I have children,</b> is <b>deemed credible,</b> and his wife is thereby exempt from levirate marriage. If he said: <b>I have brothers,</b> and his wife therefore must enter levirate marriage, <b>he</b> is <b>not deemed credible.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in that mishna, it is a case <b>where he is not presumed by us to</b> have <b>a brother.</b> Therefore, his wife is already presumed to be exempt from levirate marriage, and his claim that he has a son merely substantiates this presumption. <b>Here,</b> the mishna adds a novelty that <b>even if he is presumed to</b> have <b>a brother,</b> his claim that he has a son is accepted, and his wife is thereby exempted from levirate marriage.
<b>Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that one who says: <b>This is my son,</b> is <b>deemed credible? Since a husband who says: I divorced my wife,</b> is <b>deemed credible,</b> and his wife is thereby exempt from levirate marriage, he is deemed credible with regard to this claim as well.
As Rav Yosef forgot some of his Torah knowledge due to an illness, he questioned the accuracy of his citation of Rav Yehuda. <b>Rav Yosef said: Master of Abraham!</b> This reasoning <b>makes</b> that which <b>is taught</b> in the Mishna <b>dependent upon that which is not taught,</b> as the credibility of one who claims: This is my son, is stated in the mishna, while the <i>halakha</i> that a husband’s claim that he divorced his wife is accepted is the statement of an <i>amora</i>.
<b>Rather, if</b> this explanation <b>was stated, it was stated like this: Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: For what</b> reason <b>did</b> the Sages <b>say</b> that one who says: <b>This is my son,</b> is <b>deemed credible</b> with regard to rendering his wife exempt from levirate marriage? <b>Since it is in his power to divorce her</b> and thereby render her exempt from levirate marriage, he is deemed credible with regard to this claim as well.
<b>Rav Yosef said</b> in addition: <b>Now that you said</b> that <b>we say</b> that the husband is deemed credible <b>since</b> he has the power to divorce her, <b>a husband who says: I divorced my wife,</b> is also <b>deemed credible, since it is in his power to divorce her</b> at any time.
<b>When Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A husband who says: I have divorced my wife,</b> is <b>not deemed credible. Rav Sheshet waved his hand</b> disparagingly, as if to say that <b>Rav Yosef’s</b> statement that he is deemed credible <b>since</b> it is in his power to divorce her <b>is gone</b> due to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so?</b> Did Rabbi Yoḥanan actually say that? <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A husband who says: I have divorced my wife,</b> is <b>deemed credible?</b>
The Gemara answers: That is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> in the statement that the husband is not deemed credible, Rabbi Yoḥanan was referring to <b>a retroactive</b> testimony. For example, in a case where he testified that he divorced her on a certain date, and it is discovered that she engaged in sexual intercourse with another man after that date, his testimony is not accepted concerning whether the woman is liable to receive punishment; she is not considered to have been divorced at the time. This is because it is not in the husband’s power to divorce her retroactively.
By contrast, the statement <b>there,</b> where Rabbi Yoḥanan said that the husband’s testimony is deemed credible, refers to testimony <b>for the future,</b> e.g., where he says that he divorced her on that same day, or without specifying a date, in which case his statement is relevant only for the future. Since it was in his power to divorce her at that time, his testimony is deemed credible; if he dies, she is exempt from levirate marriage, and if she engages in sexual intercourse with another man, she is not considered to have committed adultery.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If the husband <b>said</b> that he divorced his wife on a certain date, as <b>a retroactive</b> testimony, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>concerning</b> his testimony being <b>deemed credible</b> and accepted <b>with regard to the future,</b> rendering her divorced from that time onward, despite the fact that his claim is not accepted with regard to the past?
The dilemma is based on the following fundamental question: <b>Do we divide the</b> husband’s <b>statement,</b> accepting that he divorced his wife inasmuch as she is considered divorced from that time onward, since it is in his power to divorce her now, even though his claim that he divorced her in the past is not accepted? <b>Or do we not divide the statement,</b> and say instead that his claim is rejected altogether, since his claim concerning the past cannot be accepted? <b>Rav Mari and Rav Zevid</b> engaged in a dispute with regard to this issue. <b>One says</b> that <b>we divide</b> the husband’s statement, <b>and one says</b> that <b>we do not divide</b> it.
The Gemara asks: In <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from Rava’s</b> statement? <b>As Rava says</b> that if a man says: <b>So-and-so engaged in sexual intercourse with my wife,</b> the husband <b>and another</b> witness <b>combine to kill him,</b> i.e., to have him sentenced to death for adultery. The Gemara infers: He combines with another witness <b>to kill him, but not to kill her.</b> The wife is not sentenced to death based on this testimony, even if they testified that she engaged in sexual intercourse willingly, as a husband is disqualified from bearing witness concerning his wife. Evidently, the husband’s testimony is divided; his testimony concerning the man is accepted even though the testimony concerning his wife’s part in the same action is rejected.
The Gemara answers: <b>With regard to two</b> separate <b>bodies we divide</b> the statement. Therefore the husband’s testimony is accepted with regard to the man but rejected with regard to his wife. <b>With regard to one body we do not divide</b> it. That is why one Sage holds that a husband’s claim that he divorced his wife in the past cannot be divided, so that his claim that he divorced her would be accepted while his claim as to when he divorced her would be rejected.

Daf 135a

The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man, who was presumed to have brothers but no children, <b>who was dying.</b> His wife was therefore presumed to be obligated in levirate marriage. Those with him <b>said to him: To whom</b> may <b>his wife,</b> i.e., your wife, be married? Is she required to enter into levirate marriage, or is she permitted to marry whomever she wishes? <b>He said to them: She is fit to</b> marry even <b>a High Priest.</b> She is not required to enter into levirate marriage.
<b>Rava said:</b> With <b>what</b> possibility need <b>we be concerned with regard to her? Doesn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A husband who says: I have divorced my wife,</b> is <b>deemed credible,</b> and she is exempt from levirate marriage? Therefore, this woman will be exempt as well. <b>Abaye said to him: But when Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A husband who says: I have divorced my wife,</b> is <b>not deemed credible.</b> Rava <b>said to him: But didn’t we resolve</b> the contradiction, concluding that <b>here</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan was referring to <b>a retroactive</b> testimony <b>and there</b> he was referring to testimony <b>for the future?</b> Therefore, according to both versions of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, the husband should be deemed credible in this case.
Abaye responded: <b>But shall we arise and rely on answers</b> in a halakhic ruling? Although the contradiction can be resolved in this manner, there is no guarantee that this resolution is correct. Therefore Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef’s statement should still be taken into consideration. <b>Rava</b> subsequently <b>said to Rav Natan bar Ami: Be concerned about it.</b> There may be a dispute with regard to this issue, as the resolution cannot be relied upon.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who was presumed by us,</b> i.e., the court, <b>to have no brothers, and he said at the time of his death that he has no brothers. Rav Yosef said:</b> With <b>what</b> possibility need <b>we be concerned with regard to</b> his wife, in terms of her requiring levirate marriage? For <b>one, he is presumed by us to have no brothers, and furthermore, he said at the time of</b> his <b>death that he has none. Abaye said to him:</b> But <b>don’t</b> people <b>say that there are witnesses overseas who know that he has brothers?</b> Therefore, we should be concerned that this report is accurate.
Rav Yosef responded: <b>In any event, now</b> the witnesses <b>are not</b> present <b>before us,</b> so this possibility does not need to be taken into account. <b>Isn’t this</b> the same as <b>Rabbi Ḥanina’s</b> ruling in a case where women who were captured and subsequently liberated claimed that they were not raped in captivity (<i>Ketubot</i> 23a)? <b>As</b> although people said there were witnesses elsewhere who could testify that they were raped, <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says</b> that they were permitted to marry a priest, reasoning: Just because there may be <b>witnesses in the north [<i>istan</i>],</b> i.e., in a distant place, <b>will</b> the woman <b>be forbidden?</b>
<b>Abaye said to him: If we were lenient with regard to a captive woman, due to,</b> among other reasons, the fact that <b>she makes herself repulsive before the captor</b> so that he will not want to rape her, and we assume that she was not raped, <b>should we be lenient with regard to a married woman? Rava said to Rav Natan bar Ami: Be concerned about it.</b> Do not permit this woman to remarry until the matter is clarified.
§ The mishna teaches that one who says: <b>This is my brother,</b> is <b>not deemed credible</b> with regard to his other brothers’ share of their father’s inheritance. Rather, the man in question receives a portion only from the portion of the one who testified concerning him. The Gemara clarifies: <b>And what do the other</b> brothers <b>say? If they say: He is our brother, why</b> does the man in question <b>take</b> a portion of the inheritance only <b>with</b> the one who testified, <b>from his portion, and nothing more?</b> If the other brothers admit that he is their brother, they should give him a share of their portions as well. <b>Rather, they are saying: He is not our brother.</b>
The Gemara questions this: <b>Say the last clause</b> of the mishna: If <b>property came into</b> the possession of the man in question <b>from somewhere else,</b> and he died, <b>the brothers of</b> the one who testified <b>shall inherit</b> the man in question’s property <b>with him.</b> Why should they inherit with him? <b>Didn’t they say to him: He is not our brother?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this ruling only in a case <b>where they say: We do not know</b> if he is our brother. Therefore, they are not obligated to give him a portion of their inheritance, as he cannot prove to them that he is their brother. Nevertheless, they can claim a portion of his inheritance after his death, on the basis of their brother’s testimony.
<b>Rava says: That is to say</b> that if one says to another: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession, and the other</b> person <b>says: I do not know,</b> he is <b>exempt,</b> similar to this case, where the brothers who claim that they do not know if this person is their brother are not obligated to share their inheritance with him.
<b>Abaye said:</b>

Daf 135b

<b>Actually, I will say to you</b> that one who responds to a claim that he does not know if he owes the one hundred dinars is <b>obligated</b> to pay; <b>but here,</b> in the case of the brothers, it <b>is different.</b> The brothers are not obligated to share their portion with the man in question <b>because</b> the brother who testified <b>is like</b> one who claims: <b>Another</b> person <b>has one hundred dinars in your possession.</b> Since the claimant is not the one who is owed the money, the other party can reject his claim by merely answering that he does not know whether he owes him.
§ The mishna teaches: If the man in question <b>dies,</b> the <b>property</b> he received from the father’s inheritance <b>shall return to its place,</b> i.e., to the possession of the brother who testified on his behalf, and if the man in question received property from elsewhere, it is inherited by all the brothers equally. <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>the enhancement of the property</b> received by the man in question from the portion of the brother who testified, <b>where</b> its <b>enhanced</b> value was the result of an enhancement that <b>happened naturally,</b> as opposed to one that resulted from exertion, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Who inherits it?
The Gemara elaborates: <b>With regard to enhancement that reaches shoulders,</b> i.e., ripe produce that needs only to be harvested from the field, <b>do not raise the dilemma, as it is</b> considered <b>like property that came into his possession from elsewhere.</b> It is not considered part of the land that was given to him by the brother who testified, and it is therefore divided among all the brothers. Rather, <b>let the dilemma be raised with regard to enhancement that does not reach shoulders,</b> and is not considered separate from the ground, <b>such as a palm tree that thickened,</b> or <b>land that yielded silt. What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> in this case? Is the enhancement included in the property itself, or is it considered separate property? The Gemara comments: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who died, and a will written by a person on his deathbed [<i>dayetikei</i>] is found bound to his thigh,</b> which clearly indicates that it was written by him and was not forged, <b>this is nothing.</b> The will is not valid, as he did not give it to anyone, and he may have reconsidered. If <b>he transferred ownership of</b> the will to the designated recipient <b>through another</b> person, <b>whether one of the heirs</b> or <b>whether not one of the heirs, his statement stands.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:10): <b>Which</b> deed <b>is</b> considered <b>a <i>dayetikei</i>,</b> and is collected by the designated recipient after the death of the giver? <b>Any</b> deed <b>in which it is written: This will be to stand and exist</b> after my death. <b>And which</b> type <b>is</b> considered a deed of <b>gift? Any</b> deed <b>in which it is written: From today and after</b> my <b>death.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is it</b> considered a deed of <b>gift only</b> if the expression: <b>From today and after</b> my <b>death,</b> is written, whereas if it is written only: <b>From now, it is not</b> considered a deed of <b>gift? Abaye said</b> that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: Which</b> deed of <b>gift of a healthy person is</b> considered <b>like</b> the deed of <b>gift of a person on his deathbed,</b> in <b>that</b> the recipient <b>acquires</b> it <b>only after</b> the <b>death</b> of the giver? <b>Any</b> deed <b>in which it is written: From today and after</b> my <b>death.</b>
§ <b>Rabba bar Rav Huna was sitting in the balcony of Rav’s study hall, and sat and said in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If there is <b>a person on his deathbed who says: Write</b> a deed of transfer, granting property of mine to another, <b>and give</b> with it <b>one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and</b> he then <b>died, one does not write and give</b> it. This is because <b>perhaps he resolved to transfer it</b> to him <b>only with a deed</b> of transfer, <b>and</b> since the deed was not written in his lifetime it cannot be written after his death, as <b>a deed</b> of transfer is <b>not</b> effective <b>after the death</b> of the owner.
Rabba bar Rav Huna continued that when Rabbi Yoḥanan stated this <i>halakha</i>, <b>Rabbi Elazar said to</b> the other Sages: <b>Heed this</b> <i>halakha</i>; it is correct. <b>Rav Sheizevi said:</b> That is not what happened; <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> is the one who <b>said this</b> <i>halakha</i>, <b>and</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who <b>said to them: Heed this</b> <i>halakha</i>.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It <b>is reasonable</b> to say that the incident was <b>in accordance with</b> the version presented <b>by Rav Sheizevi. Granted, if you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar said</b> the <i>halakha</i>, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan needed to affirm</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Elazar. But if you say</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> was the one who <b>said it, did Rabbi Elazar need to affirm</b> the ruling <b>of Rabbi Yoḥanan, his teacher?</b>
<b>And furthermore, come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof <b>that Rabbi Elazar</b> was the one who <b>said</b> this <i>halakha</i>, from another statement of his, <b>as Ravin sent</b> a message <b>in the name of Rabbi Abbahu: Know that Rabbi Elazar sent</b> a ruling <b>to the exile in the name of our teacher,</b> stating that if there is <b>a person on his deathbed who says: Write</b> a deed of transfer <b>and give</b> with it <b>one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and</b> he then <b>died, one does not write and give</b> it. This is because <b>perhaps he resolved to transfer it only with a deed</b> of transfer, <b>and</b> since the deed was not written in his lifetime it cannot be written after his death, as <b>a deed</b> of transfer is <b>not</b> effective <b>after the death</b> of the owner. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> This ruling is correct; however, the wording of the deed <b>should be examined.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> did Rabbi Yoḥanan mean by saying that the wording <b>should be examined?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he <b>stated</b> two <i>halakhot</i>. The first was that <b>a <i>dayetikei</i> cancels</b> a previous <b><i>dayetikei</i>.</b> The second explains the examination to which Rabbi Yoḥanan was referring: If there is <b>a person on his deathbed who said: Write</b> a deed of transfer <b>and give</b> with it <b>one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and</b> he then <b>died,</b> the court must <b>see</b> what his intention was in instructing the other person to write a deed of transfer; <b>if</b> it was <b>to enhance</b> the recipient’s <b>power</b> by writing a document proving that he was given the gift, <b>one writes</b> the document even after his death, as he intended to give the money anyway. <b>But if not,</b> rather it was the giver’s intention to transfer the gift specifically through a deed of transfer, <b>one does not write</b> it and give the money, as a deed of transfer is not effective after the death of the owner.
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If there is <b>a healthy person who said: Write</b> a deed of transfer <b>and give</b> with it <b>one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and</b> he then <b>died, one does not write and give</b> it. Rabbi Abba bar Memel inferred: <b>But</b> if <b>a person on his deathbed</b> states this request, <b>one writes and gives</b> it. <b>He raises the objection and he resolves it:</b> The ruling of that <i>baraita</i> is <b>in</b> a case where <b>he was enhancing</b> the recipient’s legal <b>power</b> by writing him a document of proof.
The Gemara explains: <b>What are the circumstances</b> under which it is apparent that <b>he was enhancing his</b> legal <b>power?</b>

Daf 136a

It is <b>as Rav Ḥisda says</b> that if it is written in the will: <b>And we acquired it from him</b> through an act of acquisition <b>in addition to this gift,</b> this formulation does not cancel the will’s power to take effect after the person’s death, as the intention of referring to it as a gift is merely to enhance the legal power of the recipient by confirming the transfer through an act of acquisition. <b>Here too,</b> in a case <b>where</b> he <b>says: Write and sign</b> a document <b>as well, and give</b> it <b>to him,</b> it is apparent that his request is to enhance the legal power of the recipient by writing a document in addition to transferring the gift itself.
<b>It was stated</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda</b> says that <b>Shmuel says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one writes</b> a document <b>and gives</b> the money in this case. <b>And Rava says similarly</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>one writes</b> a document <b>and gives</b> the money in this case.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A healthy person <b>who writes</b> a document granting <b>his property to his sons</b> in his lifetime, but wishes to continue to derive benefit from it until his death, <b>must write:</b> I give the property <b>from today and after</b> my <b>death.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: He need not</b> write: From today and after my death; it is sufficient for him to write that the transfer will take effect after he dies.
If <b>one writes</b> a document granting <b>his property to his son</b> from today and <b>after his death, the father cannot sell</b> the property <b>because it is written</b> as granted <b>to the son, and the son cannot sell</b> it <b>because it is</b> still <b>in the possession of the father</b> with regard to using the property and consuming its produce.
If <b>the father sold</b> the property, <b>it is sold</b> to the purchaser inasmuch as he may use it and consume its produce <b>until</b> the father <b>dies,</b> at which point it belongs to the son. If <b>the son sold</b> it during his father’s lifetime, <b>the purchaser has no</b> right to use it <b>until the father dies.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>And if he wrote:</b> I give the property <b>from today and after</b> my <b>death, what of it? Didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 72a): If a husband said to his wife: This is your bill of divorce from <b>today and after</b> my <b>death,</b> it is <b>a bill of divorce but not</b> a complete <b>bill of divorce, and</b> therefore <b>if he dies</b> without children his wife <b>performs the ritual through which a woman is freed of her levirate bonds [<i>ḥalitza</i>],</b> as perhaps the bill of divorce is invalid and she is bound by the levirate bond and may not remarry without first performing <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>But she does not enter into levirate marriage,</b> as perhaps the bill of divorce is valid, and it is forbidden for a divorcée to marry her former husband’s brother.
The Gemara answers: <b>There, we are uncertain if</b> the expression: And after my death, <b>is</b> meant as <b>a condition,</b> i.e., if I die you will be divorced retroactively from today, <b>or if it is a retraction</b> of the statement: From today, meaning that the divorce would take effect only after his death, which would render it invalid. <b>But here,</b> in the case of a deed of gift, there is no contradiction in the statement, as <b>this is what</b> the father <b>is</b> presumably <b>saying to him: Acquire</b> the property <b>itself today,</b> and <b>the produce after</b> my <b>death.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <b>he need not</b> write: From today and after my death. The Gemara relates: <b>Rabba bar Avuh was sick,</b> and <b>Rav Huna and Rav Naḥman entered to</b> visit <b>him. Rav Huna said to Rav Naḥman: Ask him</b> whether the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei or</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Huna: <b>I do not know Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning;</b> can <b>I ask him</b> about the <b><i>halakha</i>?</b> Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>You ask him if</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is in accordance with his opinion <b>or not, and I will tell you his reasoning</b> afterward.
Rav Naḥman <b>asked</b> Rabba bar Avuh. Rabba bar Avuh <b>said to him</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. After they left,</b> Rav Huna <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman that <b>this is Rabbi Yosei’s reasoning: He says</b> that writing: From today and after my death, is unnecessary because <b>the date</b> written <b>in a document proves</b> when <b>it</b> takes effect. The Gemara adds: <b>That is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ketubot</i> 8:4): <b>Rabbi Yosei says</b> that <b>he need not</b> write: From today and after my death, <b>because the date</b> written <b>in a document proves</b> when <b>it</b> takes effect.
§ <b>Rava asked Rav Naḥman: In</b> a case where the father performed an act of <b>transfer,</b> transferring his property to his son after his death, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it still necessary to write: From today and after my death? Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: In</b> a case where he performed an act of <b>transfer, he need not</b> write: From today and after my death.
<b>Rav Pappi said: There is</b> a case of <b>transfer where</b> he <b>needs</b> to write: From today and after my death, <b>and there is</b> a case of <b>transfer where</b> he does <b>not need</b> to do so. If it is written in the deed that <b>he transferred</b> it <b>to him and we,</b> the witnesses, <b>acquired</b> it <b>from him,</b> he does <b>not need</b> to write: From today and after my death. But if the statement is written in the opposite order: <b>We acquired</b> it <b>from him and he transferred</b> it <b>to him,</b> he still <b>needs</b> to write: From today and after my death.
<b>Rav Ḥanina of Sura objects to this</b> distinction: <b>Is there anything that we,</b> the Sages, <b>do not know, and the scribes know?</b> The distinction between the two opposite orderings of the above statement was unknown to the Sages. The Gemara relates that the Sages <b>asked Abaye’s scribes and they knew</b> the distinction, <b>and</b> they asked <b>Rava’s scribes and they</b> also <b>knew</b> the distinction.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: Whether</b> the wording is <b>he transferred</b> it <b>to him and we acquired</b> it <b>from him,</b> or <b>whether</b> it is <b>we acquired</b> it <b>from him and he transferred</b> it <b>to him,</b> he <b>need not</b> write: From today and after my death, as the act of transfer is mentioned in any event. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei in the mishna <b>disagree</b> whether the phrase: From today and after my death, is necessary only <b>with regard to</b> a case where the deed merely states: This is <b>a record of the proceedings that took place in our presence,</b> without any mention of an act of transfer.
<b>Rav Kahana said: I stated</b> this <b><i>halakha</i> in the presence of Rav Zevid of Neharde’a, and he said to me: You teach it like this,</b> i.e., as a question and answer followed by a dispute; <b>we teach it like this,</b> i.e., as a single, unbroken statement: <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>in</b> a case where <b>transfer</b> is mentioned in the deed, the owner <b>need not</b> write: From today and after my death. This is the <i>halakha</i> <b>whether</b> the wording is <b>he transferred</b> it <b>to him and we acquired</b> it <b>from him,</b> or <b>whether</b> the wording is <b>we acquired</b> it <b>from him and he transferred</b> it <b>to him;</b> he <b>need not</b> write: From today and after my death. They <b>disagree</b> only <b>with regard to</b> a case where the wording is: This is <b>a record of the proceedings that took place in our presence.</b>
§ The mishna teaches that if <b>one writes</b> a document granting <b>his property to his son</b> from today and <b>after his death,</b> neither he nor the son can sell the property. It <b>was stated</b> that in a case where <b>the son sold</b> the property <b>during the father’s lifetime, and</b> then <b>the son died during the father’s lifetime,</b> after which the father died as well,

Daf 136b

<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: The purchaser did not acquire</b> the property, <b>and Reish Lakish says: The purchaser acquired</b> the property.
The Gemara explains their reasoning: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that <b>the purchaser did not acquire</b> the property because he holds that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and the <b>profits</b> it engenders <b>is considered</b> to be <b>like ownership of the item itself.</b> Even though the property itself did not belong to the father, it is as though the father owned the property, because all of the produce belonged to him in practice. Therefore, the son’s sale can take effect only after the father’s death. If the son dies first, since he never attained ownership, his sale can never come to fruition.
<b>And Reish Lakish says: The purchaser acquired</b> the property, because he holds that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and the <b>profits</b> it engenders <b>is not considered</b> to be <b>like ownership of the item itself.</b> Therefore, the father’s rights do not prevent the son, who owns the property itself, from selling it, and eventually the purchaser receives full rights to it.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t they</b> already <b>engage in a dispute</b> concerning <b>this</b> issue <b>one time? As it was stated:</b> With regard to <b>one who sells his field for</b> just its <b>produce,</b> meaning that he retains ownership over the field itself and he sells the rights to all of its produce to someone else, <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The purchaser <b>brings</b> first fruits from this field to the Temple <b>and recites</b> the verses in the Torah associated with the bringing of the first fruits, in which he thanks God for: “The land that You, Lord, have given me” (Deuteronomy 26:10). <b>And Reish Lakish says:</b> The purchaser <b>brings</b> the first fruits, <b>but he does not recite</b> the verses, since it is not his field.
The Gemara explains the reason behind the dispute: <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says he brings</b> the first fruits <b>and recites</b> the verses because <b>he maintains</b> that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and the <b>profits</b> it engenders <b>is considered</b> to be <b>like</b> the <b>ownership of the item itself.</b> Even though the field itself does not belong to him, it is as if he acquired the field because all of the produce belongs to him in practice. <b>And Reish Lakish says</b> that <b>he brings</b> the first fruits <b>and does not recite</b> the verses <b>because</b> he holds that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and the <b>profits</b> it engenders <b>is not considered</b> to be <b>like</b> the <b>ownership of the item itself.</b> Why was it necessary for them to engage in a dispute concerning this issue twice?
The Gemara answers: It was necessary for the dispute to be stated also in the context of one who sells his father’s property and then dies. This is because <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> could have <b>said to you</b> that <b>although in general ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and the <b>profits</b> it engenders <b>is considered</b> to be <b>like</b> the <b>ownership of the item itself, here it was necessary</b> to emphasize this principle, because it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>with regard to a father and son,</b> the father presumably <b>waived</b> his rights in the property itself. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>teaches us</b> that even in this case, the father’s ownership of the rights to use an item and the profits it engenders is considered to be like the ownership of the item itself.
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> could have <b>said</b> that <b>although in general ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and the <b>profits</b> it engenders <b>is not considered</b> to be <b>like</b> the <b>ownership of the item itself,</b> as one who sells the produce of his field retains full ownership of the land itself, <b>here it was necessary</b> to emphasize this principle, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that in <b>any</b> sale <b>concerning oneself, even vis-à-vis his son, one grants preference to himself.</b> Accordingly, if one grants the property itself to his son, reserving the rights to the produce for himself, he retains the rights to the property itself as well. Reish Lakish <b>teaches us</b> that he does not retain the rights to the property.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Reish Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:4): If one states: <b>My property</b> will go <b>to you</b> after my death for your use during your lifetime, <b>and after you</b> die, <b>so-and-so will inherit</b> the property, <b>and after</b> the one who inherits after you dies, <b>so-and-so will inherit</b> the property, in this case, when <b>the first</b> recipient <b>dies, the second acquires</b> it, and when <b>the second dies, the third acquires</b> it.
If <b>the second dies during the lifetime of the first, the property returns</b> after his death <b>to the heirs of the first,</b> and does not go to the third designated recipient, as his right was to inherit it from the second, who never received it.
<b>And if it is so</b> that ownership of the rights to use an item and the profits is not considered to be like ownership of the item itself, the <i>baraita</i> <b>should have</b> stated that the property returns <b>to the heirs of the giver,</b> as the first and second recipients received only the right to use the property and enjoy its profits during their lifetimes, after which it was designated to be transferred to others. Therefore, in a case where the transfer does not apply, the property should return to the possession of the one who owns the property itself, namely the giver and his heirs.
Reish Lakish <b>said to him: Rav Hoshaya already interpreted in Babylonia</b> that a case of <b>after you,</b> i.e., where the owner said to the recipient: After you die so-and-so will inherit the property, <b>is different,</b> as the giver intended to grant full ownership of the property to the first recipient as well, including both the rights to the produce and the property itself. <b>And Rabba bar Rav Huna also raised</b> this <b>contradiction before Rav, and</b> Rav <b>said</b> in response: <b>After you, is different.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> that if the second designated recipient dies before the first, after the death of the first the property <b>returns to the heirs of the giver?</b>

Daf 137a

The Gemara answers: The <i>halakha</i> in this case <b>is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>; as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to one who said: <b>My property</b> is given <b>to you, and after you, to so-and-so, and</b> the <b>first</b> recipient <b>entered</b> the property <b>and sold</b> it <b>and consumed</b> the profits, <b>the second</b> recipient <b>repossesses</b> the property <b>from the purchasers,</b> as the property belongs to him after the death of the first recipient; <b>this is the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The second</b> recipient receives <b>only that which the first</b> beneficiary <b>left,</b> since his sale is valid.
<b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from another <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:4): If one says: <b>My property</b> is given <b>to you, and after you, to so-and-so, the first one may enter</b> the property <b>and sell</b> it <b>and consume</b> the profits; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: The first one has only</b> the right of <b>consumption of the produce.</b>
This statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>is difficult</b> as it is contradicted by the other statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and</b> this statement <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel is difficult</b> as it is contradicted by the other statement <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b> Their opinions in the latter <i>baraita</i> seem to be the opposite of those in the former <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi and the other statement <b>of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi is <b>not difficult; this</b> ruling that the first one cannot sell it is referring <b>to</b> the property <b>itself,</b> and <b>that</b> ruling that he can sell it is referring <b>to the produce.</b> The apparent contradiction between one statement <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> and the other statement <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> is <b>not difficult</b> either; <b>this</b> statement, that the first has only the right to consume the produce, is referring to his rights <b><i>ab initio</i>,</b> whereas <b>that</b> statement, that if he sold the property the second one gets nothing, is referring to the <i>halakha</i> <b>after the fact.</b>
<b>Abaye says: Who is a cunning wicked person? This</b> is <b>one who provides advice to sell property in accordance with</b> the ruling of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b> Although Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds that the sale is valid, he does not permit one to do so <i>ab initio</i>, as that would deprive the second designated recipient of the property. Therefore, one who advises the first recipient to do so is considered a cunning wicked person.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel; but</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <b>concedes that if</b> the first recipient <b>gave</b> the property to another <b>as the gift of a person on his deathbed,</b> in which case no formal act of acquisition is required, <b>he has done nothing;</b> the second recipient can repossess the property from the one to whom it was given.
<b>What is the reason? Abaye says:</b> The recipient of <b>the gift of a person on his deathbed acquires</b> it <b>only after</b> the person’s <b>death, and</b> in this case, the acquisition of the recipient resulting from the statement of: <b>After you,</b> i.e., the second designated recipient, <b>has already preceded</b> the acquisition of the first one.
The Gemara asks: <b>But did Abaye</b> actually <b>say this,</b> that the gift of a person on his deathbed takes effect only after his death? <b>But wasn’t it stated</b> in an amoraic dispute concerning the matter: <b>From when does</b> the recipient of <b>the gift of a person on his deathbed acquire</b> it? <b>Abaye says: With the completion of death,</b> i.e., at the moment he dies; <b>and Rava says: After the completion of death.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>Abaye retracted that</b> latter statement. The Gemara asks: <b>From where</b> is it known <b>that he retracted that</b> statement? <b>Perhaps he retracted this,</b> i.e., the statement that the recipient acquires it only after the person’s death, and his conclusion is that he acquires it at the moment of his death.
The Gemara answers: That possibility <b>should not enter your mind, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 72b): If a man on his deathbed says to his wife: <b>This is your bill of divorce if I die,</b> or: <b>This is your bill of divorce</b> if I die <b>from this illness,</b> or: <b>This is your bill of divorce after I die, he has said nothing.</b> The divorce does not take effect after his death. Evidently, when one gives instructions on his deathbed, his intention is for them to be effective after he dies.
<b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> that if the first recipient sells the property, the sale is valid, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if there were</b> Canaanite <b>slaves</b> included <b>in</b> the property <b>and</b> the first recipient <b>emancipated them.</b>
The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that the giver <b>would have said to him: I did not give you</b> my Canaanite slaves <b>to transgress a prohibition,</b> as it is prohibited to emancipate Canaanite slaves, Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>teaches us</b> that he has the legal right to do so.
<b>Rav Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel even if he made</b> the gift into <b>shrouds for a corpse.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that the giver would have said to him: <b>I did not give you</b> my possessions <b>to render them into items from which</b> deriving <b>benefit is prohibited,</b> but rather so that you may use and enjoy them, and Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>teaches us</b> that he may do so.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman bar Rav Ḥisda taught:</b> If one said to another: <b>This <i>etrog</i> is given to you as a gift, and after you</b> die, <b>to so-and-so,</b> and <b>the first</b> recipient then <b>took it and fulfilled</b> his obligation of taking the four species on the first day of <i>Sukkot</i> <b>with it,</b> when one is obligated to take species that belong to him, in this case, <b>we have arrived at the dispute between Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> as to the nature of the ownership of the first recipient. According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion that he cannot sell the <i>etrog</i>, it is not considered entirely his, and he does not fulfill his obligation by taking it. According to the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who holds that he can sell it, he fulfills his obligation.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak objects to this</b> statement, reasoning that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel disagree only there,</b> in the case of: After you, with regard to the nature of the recipient’s ownership; <b>as</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds</b> that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and the <b>profits</b> it engenders <b>is considered like ownership of the item itself, and</b> the other <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, <b>holds</b> that <b>ownership of</b> the rights to use an item and the <b>profits</b> it engenders <b>is not considered like ownership of the item itself. But here,</b> with regard to the <i>etrog</i>,

Daf 137b

<b>if he does not fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with it, for what</b> purpose <b>did</b> the owner <b>give it to him?</b>
<b>Rather,</b> with regard to <b>fulfilling</b> his obligation, <b>everyone agrees that he fulfills</b> his obligation <b>with it.</b> It is only in a case where the first recipient <b>sold it or consumed it,</b> that <b>we have arrived at the dispute between Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b> According to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, if he sold it, the second recipient can repossess the <i>etrog</i> from the purchaser, and if he consumed it he must pay the second recipient its value, whereas according to Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, he owes nothing to the second recipient, as the <i>etrog</i> belongs to him.
<b>Rabba bar Rav Huna says:</b> In a case of <b>brothers who acquired an <i>etrog</i> with</b> money from the jointly <b>held</b> property <b>of the estate,</b> and <b>one of them took it</b> on <i>Sukkot</i> <b>and</b> attempted to <b>fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with it,</b> the <i>halakha</i> depends on the limits of his ownership of the <i>etrog</i>: <b>If he may eat it,</b> i.e., his brothers allow him to do so, <b>he has fulfilled</b> his obligation to perform the mitzva, <b>and if not, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation.
<b>And</b> this is <b>specifically</b> in a case <b>where there is an <i>etrog</i> for each and every one</b> of the brothers; <b>but</b> if the other brothers get merely <b>a quince or a pomegranate,</b> he has <b>not</b> fulfilled his obligation even if he has the right to eat it.
<b>Rava says:</b> If one person said to another: <b>This <i>etrog</i> is given to you as a gift on the condition that you return it to me,</b> and the recipient <b>took it</b> on <i>Sukkot</i> <b>and</b> attempted to <b>fulfill</b> his obligation <b>with it,</b> if he ultimately <b>returned it, he has fulfilled</b> his obligation; if he <b>did not return it, he has not fulfilled</b> his obligation, as he did not fulfill the condition, thereby retroactively invalidating the gift. The Gemara explains that Rava <b>teaches us that a gift</b> given <b>on the condition that it be returned is considered</b> a valid <b>gift.</b>
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain woman who had a palm tree on the land of Rav Beivai bar Abaye. Whenever she would go to harvest</b> the produce from <b>it, he would get angry at her</b> for trampling on his crops. Since she did not wish to anger him, <b>she</b> decided to temporarily waive her right to the tree’s produce, and <b>transferred</b> ownership of <b>it to him</b> for <b>all the years of his life,</b> so that after his death she would once again be able to harvest the produce. <b>He</b> then <b>went and transferred it to his minor son,</b> so that it would remain in his family even following his death.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said</b> to Rav Beivai bar Abaye: Is it <b>because you descend from truncated [<i>mula’ei</i>]</b> people, as Rav Beivai’s family traced their lineage to Eli, all of whose descendants were condemned to premature death (see I Samuel 2:31), that <b>you speak truncated [<i>mulyata</i>]</b> and unsound <b>matters? Even Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> who holds that in a case where one says: My property is given to you, and after you, to so-and-so, if the first recipient sells the property the sale is valid, <b>says</b> so <b>only</b> in a case where it was to be given <b>to another</b> person; <b>but</b> if the giver said that it will return <b>to himself,</b> he did <b>not</b> say that the first recipient can sell it, as the giver clearly intended to maintain his ownership of the property. Accordingly, Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, held that Rav Beivai’s sale did not take effect.
§ <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> If one said to another: <b>This ox is given to you as a gift on the condition that you return it to me,</b> and the recipient <b>consecrated it and</b> then <b>returned it</b> to him, <b>it is consecrated and returned.</b> The consecration takes effect, and although the owner may not use it, nevertheless it is considered returned and the condition is fulfilled.
<b>Rava said to Rav Naḥman: What did he return to him?</b> The ox was not returned to the possession of the giver, as it is consecrated. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: And what did he cause him to lose?</b> He returned the ox. <b>Rather, Rav Ashi said:</b> We must rule in this case based on what <b>we see. If</b> the giver <b>said to</b> the recipient: <b>On the condition that you return it,</b> it is considered returned, as <b>he returned it.</b> But <b>if he said to him: On the condition that you return it to me, he was</b> effectively <b>saying to him</b> that he must return <b>something fit for him</b> to use. Consequently, the consecration prevents the condition from being fulfilled, and both the gift and the consecration are retroactively nullified.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If <b>one writes</b> a document granting <b>his property to another, and the other</b> person <b>says: I do not want it,</b> he <b>acquires</b> it, <b>and</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even</b> if he is <b>standing and shouting</b> in protest that he does not want it. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> that he <b>does not acquire</b> it.
<b>Rabbi Abba bar Memel said: And they do not disagree</b> with each other:

Daf 138a

<b>Here,</b> in Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement, it is a case <b>where he is shouting</b> in protest <b>at the outset.</b> As soon as he is given the deed of gift he states that he does not want it. In this case, he does not receive the property. <b>There,</b> in Shmuel’s statement, it is a case <b>where he is initially silent</b> when he receives the deed of gift, <b>and is ultimately shouting</b> in protest that he does not want it. In this case he acquires the gift before he protests, so it is his.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says</b> that if the owner <b>transfers ownership</b> of the property <b>to him through another</b> person, who performs an act of acquisition for this other party in his presence, <b>and he was initially silent,</b> i.e., when the act of acquisition is performed, <b>but ultimately shouted</b> in protest when the property is actually given to him, <b>we have arrived at the dispute between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis.</b>
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:1): If <b>one wrote</b> a document granting <b>his property to another, and there were slaves</b> among his property, <b>and the other</b> person <b>said: I do not want them, if their second master,</b> i.e., the recipient, <b>was a priest, they partake of <i>teruma</i>,</b> the portion of the produce designated for the priest, as his protest is ignored. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Once the other</b> person <b>said: I do not want them, the</b> giver or his <b>heirs have already acquired them,</b> and they are the slaves’ owners.
<b>And we discussed</b> the <i>baraita</i>: <b>And</b> does <b>the first <i>tanna</i></b> hold that he acquires them <b>even</b> if <b>he is standing and shouting</b> in protest that he does not want them? That is not reasonable.
<b>Rava says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> who says: <b>In</b> a case <b>where he is shouting</b> in protest <b>at the outset,</b> when he is given the gift, <b>everyone agrees that he did not acquire</b> them. In a case where <b>he was silent</b> at the time <b>and ultimately shouted</b> in protest, <b>everyone agrees that he acquired</b> them.
<b>When they disagree</b> it is in a case <b>when he transfers ownership to him through another</b> person, and the recipient was there <b>and was silent, and ultimately,</b> when he actually receives the slaves, he <b>shouted</b> in protest. <b>As the first <i>tanna</i> holds</b> that <b>once he was</b> initially <b>silent, he acquired them, and</b> the fact <b>that he is shouting</b> indicates that <b>he is retracting</b> his initial acceptance of the gift. His acquisition cannot be canceled in this manner. If he does not want to own the slaves, he can sell them, give them away, or emancipate them.
<b>And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds</b> that <b>his ultimate</b> actions <b>prove</b> the nature of <b>his initial</b> intent; he never intended to acquire the slaves. <b>And</b> the reason <b>that he did not shout</b> in protest <b>until now</b> is <b>that he reasoned: As long as they did not enter my possession,</b> to <b>what</b> end <b>will I shout?</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:6): If <b>a person on his deathbed said: Give two hundred dinars to so-and-so, and three hundred to so-and-so, and four hundred to so-and-so,</b> in this case one <b>does not say</b> that <b>whoever appears first in the deed acquires</b> his money first. <b>Therefore,</b> if <b>a promissory note emerged against</b> the one who gave the gifts, and it becomes clear that the money given was pledged to a creditor, then the creditor <b>collects from all of them.</b>
<b>But</b> if a person on his deathbed <b>said: Give two hundred dinars to so-and-so, and after him, to so-and-so, and after him, to so-and-so,</b> then one <b>says: Anyone who appears first in the deed gains. Therefore,</b> if <b>a promissory note emerged against</b> the giver, the creditor first <b>collects from the last</b> one of the recipients. If <b>he does not have</b> enough to repay the debt, <b>he collects from the previous</b> recipient. If <b>he does not have</b> enough to repay the debt, <b>he collects from</b> the recipient listed <b>before the previous</b> recipient.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: If there was <b>a person on his deathbed who said: Give two hundred dinars to so-and-so, my firstborn son, as is appropriate for him,</b> the firstborn <b>takes</b> the two hundred dinars <b>and takes his portion as a firstborn</b> as well. <b>If he said:</b> Give my firstborn son two hundred dinars <b>for his portion as a firstborn,</b> he does not receive both, but <b>he has the advantage;</b> if <b>he wants, he takes</b> the two hundred dinars, and if <b>he wants, he takes his portion as a firstborn.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> similarly, if there was <b>a person on his deathbed who said: Give two hundred dinars to so-and-so, my wife, as is appropriate for her, she takes</b> the two hundred dinars <b>and takes</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract</b> as well. <b>If he said:</b> Give her two hundred dinars as payment <b>for her marriage contract,</b>

Daf 138b

<b>she has the advantage;</b> if <b>she wants, she takes</b> the two hundred dinars, and if <b>she wants, she takes</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>And</b> if there was <b>a person on his deathbed who said: Give two hundred dinars to so-and-so, my creditor, as is appropriate for him,</b> the creditor <b>takes</b> the two hundred dinars <b>and takes</b> payment of the <b>debt</b> as well. <b>But if he said:</b> Give him two hundred dinars as payment <b>for</b> the <b>debt, he takes</b> the two hundred dinars as payment <b>for</b> the <b>debt.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Because he says: As is appropriate for him, he takes</b> the two hundred dinars <b>and takes</b> payment of the <b>debt</b> as well? <b>But perhaps he was saying: As is appropriate for him</b> as payment <b>for</b> the <b>debt,</b> and meant only to specify the amount of the debt.
<b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> Rav <b>Huna said to me:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this? It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Akiva, who expounds superfluous language.</b> Rabbi Akiva holds that if one uses unnecessary words, he apparently intended to add a matter.
<b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (64a): One who sells a house without specification has sold <b>neither the pit nor the cistern [<i>dut</i>]</b> with it, <b>even if he writes for</b> the buyer in the bill of sale: With <b>its depth and its height.</b> This is because anything that is not part of the house, like pits and cisterns, must be explicitly mentioned in the contract or else they remain in the seller’s possession. <b>And</b> therefore the seller <b>must purchase for himself a path</b> through the buyer’s domain to reach whatever remains his, because he has sold the area of the house along with the house itself, and he no longer has permission to walk there. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Akiva.</b>
<b>And the Rabbis say:</b> The seller <b>need not purchase for himself a path</b> through the buyer’s domain, as this is certainly included in what he has withheld for himself from the sale. <b>And Rabbi Akiva concedes that when</b> the seller <b>says to</b> the buyer in the bill of sale: I am selling you this house <b>apart from</b> the pit and the cistern, <b>he need not purchase for himself a path</b> through the buyer’s domain. Since the seller unnecessarily emphasized that the pit and the cistern are not included in the sale, he presumably intended to reserve for himself the right of access to them.
<b>Apparently,</b> according to Rabbi Akiva, <b>since he did not need</b> to state: Apart from the pit and the cistern, <b>and stated</b> it anyway, the seemingly superfluous statement <b>was coming to add a matter.</b> Since the seller unnecessarily stressed that the pit and cistern are not included in the sale, he must have intended to thereby reserve for himself the right of access. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to the gift given by a person on his deathbed to his creditor, <b>since he did not need</b> to say: As is appropriate for him, <b>and said</b> it anyway, this phrase <b>was coming to add a matter,</b> i.e., that the two hundred dinars are in addition to the debt.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 8:18): If there was <b>a person on his deathbed who said: I have one hundred dinars</b> owed to me <b>by so-and-so, the witnesses</b> that hear this <b>may write</b> his statement in a document <b>even if they do not know</b> whether the statement is true. <b>Therefore, when</b> the person’s heir <b>collects</b> the debt, <b>he must bring proof</b> of the debt, as the document written by these witnesses is not regarded as proof. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> The witnesses <b>may not write</b> the document <b>unless they know</b> for a fact that the statement is true. <b>Therefore, when</b> the heir <b>collects</b> the debt, <b>he need not bring proof</b> other than the document written by the witnesses, as it has the status of a promissory note.
<b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> Rav <b>Huna told me</b> that the opposite is <b>taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that the witnesses <b>may not write</b> his statement in a document unless they know for a fact that the statement is true, <b>and the Rabbis say</b> that <b>they may write</b> it even if they do not know whether the statement is true; <b>and even Rabbi Meir said</b> that they may not write it <b>only due to</b> the concern that it might be presented before <b>a court that errs</b> and allows the heirs to collect without furnishing additional proof. <b>Rav Dimi of Neharde’a says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>there is no concern about</b> the possibility of <b>a court that errs.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> in <b>what</b> way <b>is</b> this case <b>different from Rava’s</b> statement? <b>As Rava says:</b> A court <b>may not</b> supervise <b><i>ḥalitza</i> unless</b> the judges <b>recognize</b> the <i>yavam</i> and <i>yevama</i>. <b>And</b> a court <b>may not</b> supervise a declaration of the <b>refusal</b> of a girl upon her reaching majority to remain married to the man to whom her mother or brothers married her as a minor after the death of her father, <b>unless they recognize</b> the girl. <b>Therefore,</b> another court <b>may write a document</b> attesting to the performance <b>of <i>ḥalitza</i> or a document</b> stating that a declaration <b>of refusal</b> was made in a court elsewhere based on the testimony of witnesses <b>even if</b> the judges <b>do not recognize</b> these people, relying on the presumption the first court would not have allowed the act to be performed had they not been sure of the identities of the parties.
<b>What is the reason</b> Rava said that the court must recognize the participants in these actions? Is it <b>not due to the concern that a court that errs</b> might write such a document based on the testimony of witnesses without verifying that the participating parties were recognized by the court where the <i>ḥalitza</i> or refusal took place?
The Gemara answers: The two issues are <b>not</b> the same. <b>A court does not</b> normally <b>examine</b> the act of <b>another court,</b> so there is concern that the court where the document is written might assume that the court where the act took place recognized the participating parties. But <b>a court does</b> normally <b>examine</b> the statement of <b>witnesses.</b> Therefore, there is no concern that it will rely on a statement written by witnesses without their knowledge of its accuracy.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In continuation of the case discussed in the previous mishna of a father who wrote a document granting his property to his son but reserved the rights to the produce during his lifetime, the mishna states that <b>the father may detach</b> produce from the land <b>and feed</b> the produce <b>to whomever he wishes, and what he left detached</b> at the time of his death <b>belongs to</b> all the father’s <b>heirs,</b> not only to this son.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna indicates that what the father left <b>detached, yes,</b> it is inherited by all the heirs; but the produce that is <b>connected</b> to the ground at the time of his death, <b>no,</b> it is not inherited by them. Rather, it belongs to the son who received the property.

Daf 139a

<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ketubot</i> 8:5) that in a similar case, the court <b>appraises the</b> produce still <b>connected</b> to the ground <b>for the purchaser</b> of the land, who must pay the seller’s heirs for it? Accordingly, the connected produce also belongs to the heirs.
<b>Ulla said</b> that this is <b>not difficult; here,</b> in the mishna, the <i>halakha</i> is stated <b>with regard to his son,</b> who receives the connected produce after the father’s death. <b>There,</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, the <i>halakha</i> is stated <b>with regard to another</b> person who purchased the land from the son. <b>Since a person’s disposition is favorable toward his son,</b> the father certainly intended to bequeath the connected produce to his son together with the property itself. When the son sold it to another person, there was no such intention.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If a person died and <b>left adult and minor sons, the adults are not provided for by</b> using funds of <b>the minors, and the minors are not sustained,</b> i.e., they do not receive food, <b>by</b> using funds <b>of the adults. Rather, they receive a share</b> of the inheritance <b>equally,</b> and each son sees to his needs from his own share.
If <b>the adults married, the minors marry,</b> as the Gemara will explain. <b>But if the minors say: We are marrying in the same manner that you</b> adults <b>married</b> during our father’s lifetime, the court <b>does not listen to them. Rather, whatever their father gave</b> the adults in his lifetime <b>he gave</b> them, and the minors do not have the right to receive more than their share of the inheritance.
Similarly, if the father <b>left adult and minor daughters</b> but no sons, in which case his daughters inherit the estate, <b>the adults are not provided for by</b> using funds <b>of the minors, and the minors are not sustained by</b> using funds <b>of the adults. Rather, they receive a share</b> of the inheritance <b>equally,</b> and each daughter sees to her needs from her share.
If <b>the adult</b> daughters <b>married, the minor</b> daughters <b>marry,</b> as the Gemara will explain. <b>But if the minors say: We are marrying in the same manner that you</b> adults <b>married</b> during our father’s lifetime, the court <b>does not listen to them.</b>
<b>This</b> following <i>halakha</i> <b>is a stringency with regard to daughters’</b> inheritance <b>vis-à-vis sons’</b> inheritance: The <i>halakha</i> is <b>that the daughters are sustained by</b> using funds <b>of the sons,</b> as stipulated in their mother’s marriage contract, <b>but they are not sustained by</b> using funds <b>of the</b> other <b>daughters.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rava says:</b> With regard to <b>this eldest of the brothers who wears</b> garments <b>and covers himself from</b> the common property of <b>the house, what he did is done,</b> and the other brothers cannot subtract from his share of the inheritance as a result.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that <b>the adults are not provided for by</b> using funds <b>of the minors?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>The mishna</b> is referring <b>to an unemployed person [<i>bisherakha</i>],</b> whereas Rava was referring to the brother who handles the finances of the entire family. Therefore it is in the interest of all the brothers for him to wear appropriate attire.
The Gemara asks: If the mishna is referring to an <b>unemployed person,</b> isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that he may not take from the common inheritance of all the brothers? The Gemara answers: <b>Lest you say</b> that it is <b>preferable for them</b> that he dress appropriately so <b>that he will not be repulsive,</b> thereby dishonoring the family name, the mishna <b>teaches us</b> that he does not have the right to take money for clothing from the common inheritance, and if he does so, the brothers can subtract from his share of the inheritance as a result.
§ The mishna teaches that if <b>the adults married, the minors marry.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is it saying?</b> What does this mean?
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>it is saying:</b> If <b>the adults married after their father’s death</b> and used the common inheritance to pay for their weddings, <b>the minors</b> that <b>marry after their father’s death</b> may also pay for their weddings from the common inheritance. <b>But</b> if <b>the adults married during their father’s lifetime, and the minors said after their father’s death: We will marry in the same manner that you married,</b> the court <b>does not listen to them. Rather, whatever</b> sum <b>their father gave</b> the adults to pay for their weddings in his lifetime <b>he gave</b> them, and the minors do not have the right to demand that same sum from the inheritance.
§ The mishna teaches that if the father <b>left adult and minor daughters,</b> and the adults married, the minors marry. <b>Avuh bar Geneiva sent</b> a question <b>to Rava: Our teacher, instruct us:</b> If a woman <b>borrowed</b> money <b>and consumed</b> it, <b>and</b> before repaying the debt <b>she arose and married,</b> bringing her property into the marriage, what is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is the husband</b> considered <b>a purchaser</b> of her property <b>or is</b> he considered <b>an heir</b> to her property?
The halakhic ramification of this dilemma is as follows: <b>Is he</b> considered <b>a purchaser, and</b> the creditor therefore cannot collect his wife’s premarital debt from him, as <b>one does not collect from the purchasers a loan by oral</b> agreement? <b>Or perhaps he is</b> considered her <b>heir, and one collects from the heirs a loan by oral</b> agreement.
Rava <b>said to him: We learned</b> the answer to this question in the mishna: If <b>the adult</b> daughters <b>married, the minor</b> daughters <b>marry. What, is it not</b> teaching that if <b>the adult</b> daughters <b>married,</b> each one of them transferring money from the common inheritance <b>to</b> her <b>husband</b> to cover the wedding expenses, <b>the minor</b> daughters also <b>marry,</b> paying for the wedding <b>from</b> the money that each elder sister transferred to her <b>husband?</b> Clearly, although the money the elder daughters took from the inheritance for their weddings has the status of a loan by oral agreement, their husbands are liable to return it. This proves that the husbands are considered heirs.
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> the mishna is teaching that if <b>the adults married</b> and each one transferred money <b>to</b> her <b>husband, the minors</b> also <b>marry,</b> and each one may transfer money from the common inheritance <b>to</b> her <b>husband</b> for the wedding expenses. They cannot collect money from what was already transferred by their sisters to their husbands.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Ḥiyya teach</b> that if <b>the adults married</b> and transferred money <b>to the husband, the minors marry</b> and collect money <b>from the husband</b> of each elder sister?
The Gemara answers: Even according to this interpretation, there is no proof from the mishna with regard to the case of a loan by oral agreement. <b>Perhaps</b> the provision of wedding <b>expenses</b> for the daughters <b>is different, as it generates publicity.</b> Since it is well known that a specific portion of a person’s estate is liened to the future wedding expenses of his single daughters, it has the status of a loan with a promissory note. Therefore, the younger daughters can collect from the husbands of the elder daughters even if the status of the husbands is that of purchasers.
<b>Rav Pappa said to Rava: Is this not</b> identical to the <i>halakha</i> <b>that Ravin sent in his letter</b> from Eretz Yisrael? That <i>halakha</i> states that with regard to <b>one who died and left a widow and a daughter, his widow is sustained from his property.</b> If <b>the daughter</b> then <b>married, the widow is</b> still <b>sustained from his property,</b> although it is now in the possession of the daughter’s husband, as she had inherited the property from her father. With regard to a case where <b>the daughter</b> then <b>died</b> and her husband inherited from her, <b>Rav Yehuda, son of the sister of Rabbi Yosei ben Ḥanina, says:</b> This <b>incident occurred with me, and</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that the late man’s <b>widow is</b> still <b>sustained from his property</b> although it is fully owned by his daughter’s husband.
Rav Pappa explains: <b>Granted, if you say</b> the husband <b>is</b> considered <b>an heir,</b> it is <b>due to that</b> reason that <b>his</b> father-in-law’s <b>widow is sustained from his property;</b> it is still liened to her sustenance. <b>But if you say</b> that a husband <b>is</b> considered <b>a purchaser</b> of his wife’s property, <b>why</b> is his father-in-law’s widow <b>sustained from his property?</b> The purchasers of inherited property are not obligated to sustain the widow.
<b>Abaye said: If Ravin had not sent</b> this letter, <b>would we not have known</b> that the husband has the status of a purchaser? <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna (<i>Bekhorot</i> 52b): <b>These</b> properties <b>do not return</b> to their original owners <b>in the Jubilee</b> Year (see Leviticus 25:13–24): The portion of <b>the firstborn,</b> i.e., it does not return to the common ownership of the brothers to be shared equally like the rest of the inheritance, but rather remains in the possession of the firstborn;

Daf 139b

<b>and one who inherits</b> the property of <b>his wife</b> after her death, i.e., the property is not returned to her family. Evidently, the husband does not have the status of a purchaser, as a purchaser must return the property to its original owner in the Jubilee Year.
<b>Rava said to him: And now that</b> Ravin <b>sent</b> the letter, <b>do we</b> in fact <b>know</b> that the husband has the status of an heir? <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, say: In Usha they instituted</b> an ordinance that in the case of <b>a woman who sold her usufruct property,</b> i.e., property that she alone owns and her husband benefits only from the profits, <b>in her husband’s lifetime and</b> then <b>died, the husband repossesses</b> it <b>from the purchasers?</b> Apparently the husband’s status is that of a purchaser, as a purchaser can appropriate his purchase from a later purchaser, whereas an heir does not inherit property that the person sold before he died.
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi says</b> that <b>the Sages equated the husband with an heir, and the Sages equated him with a purchaser. And they deemed him</b> as <b>whichever is better for him,</b> based on the circumstances of the case. <b>With regard to</b> the <b>Jubilee</b> Year, <b>the Sages equated him with an heir, due to his</b> potential <b>loss</b> were he to be equated with a purchaser, as he would be obligated to return the property to his wife’s heirs. <b>With regard to</b> the case <b>of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina,</b> where the wife sold the property, <b>the Sages equated him with a purchaser, due to his</b> potential <b>loss</b> were he to be equated with an heir. <b>With regard to Ravin’s</b> <i>halakha</i>, concerning the sustenance of the husband’s father-in-law’s widow, <b>due to the</b> potential <b>loss of the widow, the Sages equated him with an heir.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But with regard to</b> the case <b>of Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Ḥanina, there is a loss to the purchasers,</b> from whom the husband appropriates the property, <b>and</b> nevertheless, <b>the Sages equated him with a purchaser.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> the purchasers <b>caused their own loss. Since</b> they knew <b>that there is a husband, they should not have purchased</b> property <b>from a wife living under</b> the authority of <b>her husband,</b> removing it from the husband and his heirs.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who died and left</b> behind both <b>sons and daughters, when the estate is large the sons inherit</b> the estate <b>and the daughters are provided with sustenance</b> from it according to the stipulations of the deceased’s marriage contract with their mother. With regard to <b>a small estate,</b> which is insufficient to provide for both the sons and the daughters, <b>the daughters are provided with sustenance. And</b> if <b>the sons,</b> who receive in this case neither inheritance nor sustenance, have no other means with which to support themselves, <b>they</b> go and <b>request</b> charity <b>at the doors. Admon says,</b> rhetorically: <b>I lost out</b> just <b>because I am male?</b> Rather, he holds that the sons also receive sustenance. <b>Rabban Gamliel said: I see</b> as correct <b>the statement of Admon.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>And how large</b> must the estate be in order for the sons to inherit it? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> Large <b>enough to provide sustenance from it for</b> both <b>these,</b> the sons, <b>and those,</b> the daughters, for <b>twelve months.</b> Rav Yehuda continues: <b>When I said this</b> ruling <b>before Shmuel, he said: That is the statement of Rabban Gamliel bar Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>But the Rabbis say:</b> The estate must be large <b>enough to provide sustenance from it for</b> both <b>these and those until</b> the time <b>that</b> the daughters <b>reach their majority,</b> at age twelve and six months, as indicated in the marriage contract.
This <b>was also stated</b> by other <i>amora’im</i>: <b>When Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael, he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says, and some say</b> it was <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana</b> who <b>says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Any</b> estate <b>that</b> is large enough <b>to provide sustenance from it for</b> both <b>these and those until</b> the time <b>that</b> the daughters <b>reach their majority is a large</b> estate; <b>less than that, this is a small</b> estate.
The Gemara asks: <b>And if there is not</b> enough to provide <b>for these and those until</b> the daughters <b>reach their majority,</b>

Daf 140a

shall the <b>daughters take all</b> of the estate, even if it is more than is required for their sustenance? <b>Rather, Rava said:</b> The court <b>appropriates sustenance for the daughters until they reach their majority, and the remainder</b> is given <b>to the sons.</b>
§ The Gemara comments: It is <b>obvious</b> that if the estate was <b>large and became small,</b> the <b>heirs,</b> i.e., the sons, <b>already acquired it</b> when it was large. It remains in their possession, and they must provide for the daughters from it. The Gemara asks: If the estate was <b>small,</b> and was therefore not inherited by the sons, <b>and</b> then it <b>became large, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Does even a small estate <b>remain in the possession of the heirs,</b> while the court reserves it for the daughters’ sustenance, and <b>therefore it appreciated in the possession of</b> the <b>heirs</b> and they receive the appreciation in the estate’s value? <b>Or perhaps</b> the <b>heirs are</b> totally <b>removed from</b> possession of a small estate, and the appreciation in value is to the benefit of the daughters receiving sustenance.
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In the case of <b>orphans who preemptively sold</b> land <b>from a small estate</b> left to them by their father, before the court appropriated it for the daughters’ sustenance, concerning <b>that which they sold,</b> the <b>sale</b> is valid, even though they acted improperly. One can infer from this that a small estate remains in the possession of the heirs even when they are not authorized to derive benefit from it, and therefore the appreciation in its value belongs to them.
§ <b>Rabbi Yirmeya was sitting before Rabbi Abbahu and raised</b> the following <b>dilemma before him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the sustenance to which the deceased’s <b>widow</b> is entitled? Does it <b>reduce</b> the value of <b>the estate</b> when evaluating whether the estate is categorized as a large estate or a small estate? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since she has</b> a right to receive <b>sustenance,</b> it <b>reduces</b> the value of the estate? <b>Or perhaps</b> we say that <b>since if she remarries she does not have</b> a right to sustenance, <b>now as well,</b> for the purposes of determining the value of the estate, she is considered as if <b>she does not have</b> a right to sustenance, and therefore it does not reduce the value of the estate.
Furthermore, <b>if you say</b> that <b>since, if she remarries she does not have</b> a right to sustenance, <b>now as well</b> she is considered as if <b>she does not have</b> a right to sustenance, and it is not taken into account when evaluating the estate, then another dilemma can be raised: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the sustenance one pledged to give, for a certain number of years, to the <b>daughter of his wife</b> from a previous marriage, i.e., his step-daughter, which is an obligation not affected by his death or by her marriage? Does it <b>reduce</b> the value of <b>the estate? Do we say</b> that <b>since, when she marries she also has</b> a right to sustenance, it <b>reduces</b> the value of the estate? <b>Or perhaps</b> we say that <b>since, if she dies she does not have</b> a right to sustenance, it <b>does not reduce</b> the value of the estate.
<b>And if you say</b> that <b>since, if she dies she does not have</b> a right to sustenance, therefore it <b>does not reduce</b> the value of the estate, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a debt owed to the deceased’s <b>creditor?</b> Does it <b>reduce</b> the value of <b>the estate? Do we say</b> that <b>since, when</b> the creditor <b>dies he also has</b> a right to the money owed him, and it is collected by his heirs, therefore it <b>reduces</b> the value of the estate? <b>Or perhaps</b> we say that <b>since it has not yet been collected,</b> it <b>does not reduce</b> the value of the estate.
<b>And there are</b> those who say <b>that</b> Rabbi Yirmeya <b>raised the dilemmas in the opposite direction,</b> i.e., in the reverse order: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a debt owed to <b>a creditor?</b> Does it <b>reduce</b> the value of <b>the estate?</b>

Daf 140b

<b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to sustenance the deceased pledged to give <b>the daughter of his wife</b> from a previous marriage? Does it <b>reduce</b> the value of <b>the estate? What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the sustenance to which <b>his widow</b> is entitled? Does it <b>reduce</b> the value of <b>the estate?</b> Furthermore, with regard to <b>his widow and daughter, which of them takes precedence</b> if the estate is insufficient to provide sustenance for both?
Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya: <b>Go now and come</b> back <b>tomorrow. When he came</b> back, Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to</b> him: <b>Resolve at least one</b> of your questions, <b>as Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rabbi Asi says:</b> The Sages <b>established</b> the status of the <b>widow in relation to the daughter as</b> equivalent to the status of the <b>daughter in relation to the brothers in</b> the case of <b>a small estate. Just as</b> in the case of <b>a daughter in relation to</b> her <b>brothers, the daughter is sustained and the brothers</b> go and <b>request</b> charity <b>at the doors, so too</b> in the case of <b>a widow in relation to the daughter, the widow is sustained and the daughter</b> goes and <b>requests</b> charity <b>at the doors.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>Admon says,</b> rhetorically: <b>I lost out</b> just <b>because I am male?</b> Rather, he holds that the sons also receive sustenance. The Gemara asks: <b>What is he saying? Abaye said</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>he is saying: Because I am male, and I am fit to engage in</b> the study of <b>the Torah, I lost out</b> and must go begging instead of studying the Torah? <b>Rava said to him: If that is so,</b> should one conclude that <b>it is</b> only <b>one who engages in</b> the study of <b>the Torah who inherits,</b> whereas one <b>who does not engage in</b> the study of <b>the Torah does not inherit? Rather, Rava said</b> that <b>this</b> is what Admon <b>is saying: Because I am male, and I am fit to inherit in</b> the case of <b>a large estate,</b> should <b>I lose</b> my inheritance entirely <b>in</b> the case of <b>a small estate?</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to one who <b>left</b> behind <b>sons and daughters and a <i>tumtum</i>,</b> whose halakhic status as male or female is indeterminate, the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: <b>When the estate is large the males direct</b> the <i>tumtum</i> <b>to the females</b> and exclude him from the inheritance, claiming that perhaps the <i>tumtum</i> is female. When the <b>estate is small, the females direct</b> the <i>tumtum</i> <b>to the males</b> and exclude him from receiving sustenance, claiming that perhaps the <i>tumtum</i> is male.
With regard to <b>one who says: If my wife gives birth to a male</b> the offspring <b>shall receive</b> a gift of <b>one hundred dinars,</b> if <b>she</b> in fact <b>gave birth to a male,</b> the offspring <b>receives one hundred dinars.</b> If he says: If my wife gives birth to <b>a female</b> the offspring shall receive a gift of <b>two hundred</b> dinars, if <b>she</b> in fact <b>gave birth to a female,</b> the offspring <b>receives two hundred</b> dinars.
If he says: <b>If</b> my wife gives birth to <b>a male</b> the offspring shall receive a gift of <b>one hundred dinars</b> and <b>if</b> she gives birth to <b>a female</b> the offspring shall receive a gift of <b>two hundred</b> dinars, <b>and</b> in fact <b>she gave birth to</b> both <b>a male and a female,</b> the <b>male</b> offspring <b>receives one hundred dinars</b> and the <b>female</b> offspring <b>receives two hundred</b> dinars. If <b>she gave birth to a <i>tumtum</i>,</b> the <i>tumtum</i> <b>does not receive</b> anything. <b>If he said: Whatever</b> offspring <b>my wife gives birth to shall receive</b> a gift of a certain sum, and she gave birth to a <i>tumtum</i>, the <i>tumtum</i> <b>receives</b> it. <b>And if there is no heir other than</b> the <i>tumtum</i>, the <i>tumtum</i> <b>inherits all</b> of the estate.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that the males direct the <i>tumtum</i> to the females. The Gemara asks: Does this mean that <b>they direct him, and he takes</b> sustenance <b>like a daughter? Isn’t it taught</b> in the <b>latter clause</b> of the mishna that if one said that either his male or female child will receive a certain sum once his wife gives birth, and <b>she gave birth to a <i>tumtum</i>,</b> the <i>tumtum</i> <b>does not receive</b> anything? This indicates that the <i>tumtum</i> does not have the rights of a female. <b>Abaye says:</b> The mishna means that <b>they direct him</b> to the females, <b>but he has no</b> rights to sustenance.
<b>And Rava says: They direct him</b> to the females <b>and he has</b> a right to sustenance. <b>And</b> with regard to <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna, which grants the <i>tumtum</i> nothing at all, there <b>we arrive at</b> the opinion of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Temura</i> 24b): If one consecrates a firstborn animal while it is still a fetus, stating that if it is male it shall be a burnt-offering and if it is female it shall be a peace-offering, and the mother <b>gave birth to a <i>tumtum</i> or a hermaphrodite [<i>androginos</i>], Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: It is not imbued with sanctity,</b> as it is neither male nor female. So too, in the case discussed in the mishna here, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel maintains that the <i>tumtum</i> receives nothing, as he is considered to be a distinct entity of indeterminate sex, neither male nor female.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>A <i>tumtum</i> inherits as a son and is sustained as a daughter. Granted, according to Rava,</b> the <i>baraita</i> can be explained to mean that the clause: <b>Inherits as a son,</b> is <b>in</b> the case of <b>a small estate,</b> as the daughters direct the <i>tumtum</i> to the sons, and just as there is no inheritance for the sons, there is none for the <i>tumtum</i> either. And the clause: <b>And is sustained as a daughter,</b> is <b>in</b> the case of <b>a large estate,</b> as the sons direct the <i>tumtum</i> to the daughters, and the <i>tumtum</i> receives sustenance along with them.

Daf 141a

<b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Abaye, what</b> does it mean that the <i>tumtum</i> <b>is sustained as a daughter,</b> since Abaye maintains that the <i>tumtum</i> does not have the rights of a daughter? The Gemara responds: <b>And according to your reasoning,</b> even <b>according to Rava, what</b> does it mean that a <i>tumtum</i> <b>inherits as a son,</b> since Rava concedes that the <i>tumtum</i> and sons do not actually inherit anything? <b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> means that it is <b>fitting</b> for the <i>tumtum</i> <b>to inherit but he does not</b> actually inherit. <b>Here too,</b> with regard to sustenance, according to Abaye, the <i>baraita</i> means that it is <b>fitting</b> for the <i>tumtum</i> <b>to be sustained, but he is not</b> actually sustained.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>one who says: If my wife gives birth to a male</b> the offspring shall receive one hundred dinars, if she in fact gave birth to a male, the offspring receives one hundred dinars. If he says: If my wife gives birth to a female the offspring shall receive two hundred dinars, if she in fact gave birth to a female, the offspring receives two hundred dinars. The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that for him a daughter is preferable to a son? But</b> this seems to contradict what <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai:</b> With regard to <b>anyone who does not leave</b> behind <b>a son to inherit</b> from <b>him, the Holy One, Blessed be He, is filled with wrath upon him, as it is stated:</b> “If a man dies, and has no son, <b>then you shall cause his inheritance to pass [<i>veha’avartem</i>] to his daughter”</b> (Numbers 27:8). The term <b><i>ha’avara</i></b> means <b>nothing other</b> than <b>wrath, as it is stated: “That day is a day of wrath [<i>evra</i>]”</b> (Zephaniah 1:15).
The Gemara resolves the contradiction: <b>With regard to the matter of inheritance, for him a son is preferable</b> to a daughter, as a son bears his name and retains his ancestral heritage within his father’s tribe, but <b>with regard to the matter of</b> providing for his offspring’s <b>comfort, for him his daughter is preferable</b> to his son, as a son is more capable of coping for himself and the daughter needs more support.
<b>And Shmuel said: Here we are dealing with</b> a mother who is <b>giving birth for the first time, and</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rav Ḥisda, as Rav Ḥisda says:</b> If one gives birth to <b>a daughter first,</b> it <b>is a good sign for sons. There are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this is <b>because she raises her brothers,</b> i.e., helps in their upbringing, <b>and there are</b> those <b>who say</b> that this is <b>because the evil eye does not have dominion over</b> the father. <b>Rav Ḥisda said: And</b> as <b>for myself, I prefer daughters to sons.</b>
The Gemara adds: <b>And if you wish, say:</b> In accordance with <b>whose</b> statement is <b>this</b> mishna in which preference is given to the daughter? <b>It is</b> in accordance with the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Which</b> statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda</b> is this referring to? <b>If we say</b> it is referring to the statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda with regard to</b> the term <b>“with everything [<i>bakkol</i>],”</b> that is difficult. The Gemara cites Rabbi Yehuda’s statement. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: “And Abraham was old, well stricken in age; <b>and the Lord had blessed Abraham with everything [<i>bakkol</i>]”</b> (Genesis 24:1). <b>Rabbi Meir says:</b> The blessing was <b>that he did not have a daughter. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The blessing was <b>that he had a daughter, and her name</b> was <b>Bakkol.</b> Evidently, Rabbi Yehuda understands the birth of a daughter to be a blessing. The Gemara explains the difficulty: <b>Say that you heard Rabbi Yehuda</b> explain that the blessing was that <b>the Merciful One did not even deprive Abraham</b> of <b>a daughter,</b> in addition to his sons. <b>Did you hear him</b> say <b>that</b> a daughter is <b>preferable to a son?</b>
The Gemara proposes another of Rabbi Yehuda’s statements: <b>Rather,</b> it is referring to <b>this</b> other statement of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One is not halakhically obligated to provide sustenance for his children beyond the age of six. Nevertheless, it is <b>a mitzva to provide sustenance for the daughters. And</b> one can infer <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that it is certainly a mitzva to provide <b>for sons, who are engaged in</b> the study of <b>the Torah;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> It is <b>a mitzva to provide sustenance for the sons. And</b> one can infer <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that it is certainly a mitzva to provide <b>for daughters,</b> so <b>that they not be disgraced</b> by having to beg for their livelihood. This indicates that with regard to providing sustenance for one’s children, Rabbi Yehuda gives preference to the daughters.
§ The mishna discusses a case where one stipulated that if his wife gives birth to a male the offspring shall receive one hundred dinars, and if she gives birth to a female the offspring shall receive two hundred dinars. The mishna states that if she gave birth to both a male and a female, the male receives one hundred dinars and the female receives two hundred. The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:4): If she <b>gave birth to a male and a female, the male receives six dinars</b> of gold, which are equivalent to one hundred fifty dinars of silver, <b>and the female receives two dinars</b> of gold, equivalent to fifty dinars of silver, <b>with what</b> situation is this <i>baraita</i> dealing?
<b>Rav Ashi said: I said this <i>halakha</i> before Rav Kahana,</b> and he explained it as teaching <b>about one who inverted</b> the stipulations of his gift. The <i>baraita</i> is referring to one <b>who said:</b> If <b>a male</b> is born <b>first</b> he will receive <b>two hundred</b> dinars, and if <b>a female</b> is born <b>after him</b> she will receive <b>nothing.</b> And if <b>a female</b> is born <b>first</b> she will receive <b>one hundred dinars,</b> and if <b>a male</b> is born <b>after her</b> he will receive <b>one hundred dinars. And</b> the mother <b>gave birth to a male and a female, but we do not know which of them emerged</b> from the womb <b>first.</b> In this case, the <b>male takes one hundred dinars,</b> as <b>whichever way you</b> look at it, this sum is due to him. <b>The other one hundred dinars are property of uncertain ownership and are divided</b> equally between the male and female.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>that which is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: If <b>she gave birth to a male and a female, he</b> receives <b>only one hundred dinars, how can you find these</b> circumstances? <b>Ravina said:</b> This is referring <b>to</b> one who said: I shall give a certain sum to whoever <b>informs me.</b>

Daf 141b

This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 9:5): In a case where one said: <b>Whoever informs me</b> as <b>to what opened my wife’s womb,</b> i.e., what the sex of her child is, <b>if</b> it is <b>a male,</b> the one who informs me <b>shall receive one hundred dinars.</b> Therefore, if the wife <b>gave birth to a male,</b> the one who informed him <b>receives one hundred dinars.</b> If he also said: <b>If</b> it is <b>a female</b> he shall receive <b>one hundred dinars,</b> if <b>she gave birth to a female,</b> he <b>receives one hundred dinars.</b> If <b>she gave birth to a male and a female, he</b> receives <b>only one hundred dinars.</b>
The Gemara challenges: <b>But</b> since <b>he did not say</b> anything about <b>a male and a female,</b> if she gave birth to a male and a female, he should not receive anything. Why does the <i>baraita</i> state that he receives one hundred dinars? The Gemara answers: This is referring to <b>where he also said: If</b> she gives birth to <b>a male and a female</b> he shall <b>also receive one hundred dinars.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> if he stated all of the possibilities, <b>what</b> did his stipulations serve <b>to exclude?</b> The Gemara answers: They serve <b>to exclude</b> a case where she gives birth to <b>a non-viable newborn,</b> in which case he receives nothing.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who said to his wife: My property</b> is given <b>to the one with whom you are pregnant. Rav Huna said: This is</b> a case of <b>one who transfers ownership</b> of an item <b>to a fetus, and</b> in the case of <b>one who transfers ownership</b> of an item <b>to a fetus,</b> the fetus <b>does not acquire</b> the item.
<b>Rav Naḥman raised an objection to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna</b> opinion from the mishna, which states: With regard to <b>one who says: If my wife gives birth to a male</b> the offspring <b>shall receive one hundred dinars,</b> if <b>she</b> in fact <b>gave birth to a male,</b> the offspring <b>receives one hundred dinars.</b> This indicates that the fetus did acquire the money. Rav Huna <b>said to him: I do not know who taught our mishna.</b> It is not identifiable with a known opinion, and presumably the text has been corrupted.
The Gemara asks why Rav Huna replied in this manner: <b>But let him say to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can transfer ownership</b> of <b>an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world,</b> e.g., produce that has not yet grown. Just as he maintains that one can transfer ownership of an entity that has not yet come into the world, so too, he maintains that one can transfer ownership of an item to a fetus, who has not yet been born.
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>Say that you heard Rabbi Meir</b> express this opinion with regard to transferring ownership of an entity that has not yet come into the world <b>to an entity that is in the world. Did you hear him</b> speak of transferring ownership <b>to an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world,</b> e.g., a fetus?
The Gemara proposes another resolution to Rav Naḥman’s objection: <b>But let</b> Rav Huna <b>say to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, who says: A fetus acquires</b> ownership, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Yevamot</i> 67a): With regard to an Israelite woman who married a priest and he died and left her pregnant, the <b>fetus disqualifies</b> its father’s Canaanite slaves from partaking of <i>teruma</i>, because until it is born the fetus is not considered a priest, and the slaves, who are part of its inheritance, are not the slaves of a priest. <b>And</b> the fetus <b>does not enable</b> its mother <b>to partake</b> of <i>teruma</i>, even though it is the child of a priest. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yosei.</b> It is evident from this mishna that Rabbi Yosei holds that a fetus inherits its father’s property.
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>Inheritance is different,</b> since, unlike a gift, <b>it comes</b> into the possession of the heir <b>by itself,</b> without a formal act of acquisition. Therefore, a fetus can acquire an inheritance, but not a gift.
The Gemara proposes another resolution to Rav Naḥman’s objection: <b>But let</b> Rav Huna <b>say to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka, who says:</b> The case of <b>an inheritance is not different, and</b> the case of <b>a gift</b> one gives to his heir <b>is not different,</b> i.e., the same <i>halakhot</i> apply to both. <b>As we learned</b> in a mishna (130a): <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka says: If one said about</b> a person <b>who is fit to inherit</b> from <b>him,</b> e.g., one of his sons: This person will inherit all of my property, <b>his statement stands.</b>
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>Say that you heard Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka</b> express this opinion with regard to a gift given <b>to an entity that</b> already <b>exists in the world,</b> but <b>does he say</b> anything with regard to a gift given <b>to an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world?</b>
The Gemara proposes another resolution to Rav Naḥman’s objection: <b>But let</b> Rav Huna <b>say to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>It is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> who compares a gift to an inheritance, <b>and he holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> that a fetus is fit to inherit. The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>Who says that</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka <b>holds</b> in accordance <b>with</b> the opinion of Rabbi Yosei?
The Gemara proposes another resolution to Rav Naḥman’s objection: <b>But let</b> Rav Huna <b>say to</b> Rav Naḥman that the mishna is referring not to one who gave a gift to the fetus, but <b>to</b> one who said: I shall give a certain sum to whoever <b>informs me.</b> This person is in the world. The Gemara rejects this explanation as well: <b>If that is so,</b> then concerning <b>that</b> which <b>the last clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches: And if there is no heir other than</b> the <i>tumtum</i>, the <i>tumtum</i> <b>inherits all</b> of the estate, <b>if</b> the mishna is referring <b>to</b> one who said: I shall give a certain sum to whoever <b>informs me, what is the purpose of</b> mentioning <b>an heir,</b> since the mishna is not discussing a gift to the heir at all?
The Gemara proposes another resolution to Rav Naḥman’s objection: <b>But let</b> Rav Huna <b>say to</b> Rav Naḥman: The mishna is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> the gift was made after his wife had already <b>given birth</b> but he did not yet know the sex of the baby. The Gemara rejects this explanation as well: <b>If that is so,</b> then concerning <b>that</b> which <b>the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches: Whatever</b> offspring <b>my wife gives birth to shall receive</b> a certain sum, and she gave birth to a <i>tumtum</i>, the <i>tumtum</i> <b>receives</b> it, there is a difficulty. According to this explanation, the phrase: <b>Whatever</b> offspring my wife <b>gives birth to,</b> is incorrect. The mishna <b>should have said: Whatever</b> offspring my wife <b>gave birth to.</b>

Daf 142a

The Gemara proposes another resolution to Rav Naḥman’s objection: <b>But let</b> Rav Huna <b>say to</b> Rav Naḥman that the mishna is referring to one <b>who says</b> that the transfer of ownership should take effect <b>when she gives birth,</b> at which point the child already exists. The Gemara rejects this resolution: Rav Huna does not interpret the mishna in this way, because <b>Rav Huna</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as Rav Huna says: Even</b> if one says that the transfer of ownership should take effect <b>when she gives birth,</b> the fetus <b>does not acquire</b> it.
The Gemara clarifies: <b>As Rav Naḥman says:</b> With regard to <b>one who transfers ownership</b> of an item <b>to a fetus,</b> the fetus <b>does not acquire</b> it. But if he says that the transfer of ownership of the item should take effect <b>when she gives birth,</b> the fetus <b>acquires</b> it. <b>And Rav Huna says: Even</b> if he says that the transfer of ownership of the item should take effect <b>when she gives birth,</b> the fetus <b>does not acquire</b> it, because the fetus did not exist in the world when he transferred ownership. <b>And Rav Sheshet says:</b> In <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, the fetus <b>acquires</b> the item.
<b>Rav Sheshet said: From where do I say</b> that the fetus acquires the item? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>a convert who died,</b> apparently without offspring, <b>and Jews plundered [<i>uvizbezu</i>] his property,</b> assuming that he had no heirs and his property was therefore ownerless, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>they heard that he had a son or that his wife was pregnant, they are obligated to return</b> the property. If <b>they returned it all, and then they heard that his son died or that his wife miscarried,</b> if one <b>took possession at the second</b> time, after hearing about the death or the miscarriage, he <b>acquired</b> the property, <b>but</b> if one took possession only <b>at the first</b> time, before it was known there was an heir at all, he <b>did not acquire</b> the property.
Rav Sheshet explains: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> that <b>a fetus does not acquire</b> property, <b>why do they</b> need to <b>take possession</b> again <b>the second</b> time? <b>Didn’t they</b> already <b>take possession one time?</b> Evidently, the miscarried fetus had acquired ownership in the meantime.
<b>Abaye said</b> in reply to Rav Sheshet: <b>Inheritance, which comes</b> into the possession of the heir <b>by itself</b> without a formal act of acquisition, <b>is different.</b> Even if a fetus inherits property, it may not be able to acquire property in any other manner, e.g., receiving a gift. <b>Rava said:</b> It <b>is different there,</b> in the case where they plundered the property of the convert, <b>as</b> the property <b>was initially</b> only <b>loosely held in their hands,</b> as they did not clearly know whether or not the deceased convert had heirs. Therefore, the first time they took possession was not sufficient, and they needed to take possession again in order to acquire the property.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> Abaye’s refutation and Rava’s refutation? The practical difference <b>between them</b> is in a case <b>where they</b> initially <b>heard</b> with regard <b>to</b> the fetus <b>that he</b> had <b>died,</b> and they then took possession of the property. <b>But</b> in reality, he had <b>not died, and then</b> he <b>died.</b> According to Abaye, a fetus inherits property. Therefore, the property was not ownerless, and the plunderers did not acquire it. According to Rava, since the plunderers heard that the fetus had died, they took a firm hold upon the property, and they acquired it the first time.
The Gemara offers another refutation of the opinion of Rav Sheshet: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 43b–44a): <b>A one-day-old child inherits</b> property <b>and bequeaths</b> property. One can infer that if the child is <b>one day old, yes,</b> he inherits property; but <b>a fetus</b> does <b>not.</b> The Gemara replies: <b>Doesn’t Rav Sheshet say</b> that the mishna teaches a different <i>halakha</i>? The mishna teaches that a one-day-old child <b>inherits his mother’s property</b> the moment he is born, so that he is able <b>to bequeath</b> it, if he then dies, <b>to</b> his heirs who are not the mother’s heirs, e.g., his <b>paternal brothers.</b> This <i>halakha</i> <b>specifically</b> applies from when he is <b>one day old, but a fetus</b> whose mother died <b>does not</b> inherit from her. <b>What is the reason</b> for this?

Daf 142b

The reason is <b>that</b> we presume that the fetus <b>died first,</b> before its mother died, <b>and the son does not inherit from his mother</b> while <b>in the grave,</b> in order <b>to bequeath</b> the inheritance <b>to his paternal brothers.</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that if a son dies, and afterward his mother dies, the deceased son does not inherit from his mother and subsequently bequeath the inheritance to his paternal brothers, who are not related to the mother. But in other cases, where it is not his mother’s estate, a fetus inherits property.
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that</b> it is certain that the fetus <b>died first? But there was an incident</b> where the mother died <b>and</b> the fetus <b>made three spasmodic motions</b> afterward. Apparently, a fetus can die after the mother. <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said:</b> That incident was <b>just as it is with the tail of the lizard, which jerks</b> after being severed from the lizard, but it is just a spasmodic motion which does not indicate that it is still alive.
<b>Mar, son of Rav Yosef, says in the name of Rava:</b> The mishna comes <b>to say that</b> a one-day-old child <b>reduces the portion of the firstborn.</b> The firstborn is entitled to a double portion of the inheritance, and this is calculated taking into account the portion due to his dead brother. <b>And</b> it is in this context that <b>specifically</b> the portion of <b>a one-day-old</b> child is taken into account, <b>but</b> the portion of <b>a fetus is not</b> taken into account, even though a fetus also inherits property. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The Merciful One states</b> concerning the portion of the firstborn: “If a man has two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, <b>and they bore him children,</b> both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated” (Deuteronomy 21:15). The term “children” excludes a fetus.
This is similar to another <i>halakha</i>, <b>as Mar, son of Rav Yosef, says in the name of Rava: A son who was born after his father’s death does not reduce the firstborn’s portion. What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: <b>“And they bore him children,” and this</b> term “children” <b>does not</b> apply to a fetus.
The Gemara notes: <b>In Sura they taught</b> Mar’s statement <b>that</b> way, but <b>in Pumbedita they taught</b> it <b>this</b> way: <b>Mar, son of Rav Yosef, says in the name of Rava: A firstborn who was born after his father’s death does not receive a double</b> portion. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>The Merciful One states</b> in the Torah: “But <b>he shall acknowledge</b> the firstborn, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion” (Deuteronomy 21:17), <b>and</b> in this case the father <b>is not</b> there <b>that</b> he can <b>acknowledge</b> him. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i> is in accordance with all these versions</b> of that <b>which Mar, son of Rav Yosef, says in the name of Rava.</b> Accordingly, a one-day-old child reduces the portion of the firstborn, a son born after his father’s death does not reduce the firstborn’s portion, and a firstborn born after his father’s death does not receive a double portion.
§ <b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> With regard to <b>one who transfers ownership</b> of an item <b>to a fetus,</b> the fetus <b>does not acquire</b> the item. <b>And if you say</b> that the statement of <b>our mishna</b> (140b), with regard to one who gives a gift to his unborn child, indicates that an item can be transferred to a fetus, the circumstances there are unique. <b>Since the disposition of a person</b> is to be <b>inclined toward his son,</b> the Sages validated such a transfer, but one cannot transfer an item to the unborn child of another.
<b>Shmuel said to Rav Ḥana of Baghdad: Go out</b> and <b>bring me an assembly of ten</b> men, <b>and I will say</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>to you in their presence,</b> so that it will be well publicized. The <i>halakha</i> was: With regard to <b>one who transfers ownership</b> of an item <b>to a fetus,</b> the fetus <b>acquires</b> the item. The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that with regard to <b>one who transfers ownership</b> of an item <b>to a fetus,</b> the fetus <b>does not acquire</b> the item.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who said to his wife,</b> before she conceived: <b>My property</b> is given <b>to the sons that I will have from you. His older son</b> from a previous marriage <b>came</b> and <b>said to him: That man,</b> i.e., me, <b>what will become of him,</b> i.e., will I receive nothing? <b>He said to</b> his son: <b>Go</b> and <b>acquire</b> a portion <b>like one of the sons</b> who will be born, i.e., you will receive a share as well. The Gemara comments: <b>Those</b> sons who were not yet born <b>certainly did not acquire</b> the property, and do not receive more than their share as heirs, <b>as they are not yet</b> in existence.
The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>this</b> son, <b>does the young man [<i>letalya</i>]</b> receive an additional <b>share</b> of the inheritance in a case <b>where</b> there are other <b>sons</b> from the second wife, since his father gave him an additional share, <b>or does the young man not</b> receive an additional <b>share</b> of the inheritance <b>where</b> there are other <b>sons?</b> There are <b>Rabbi Avin, and Rabbi Meyasha, and Rabbi Yirmeya, who</b> all <b>say: The young man does</b> receive an additional <b>share</b> of the inheritance <b>where</b> there are other <b>sons.</b> And there are <b>Rabbi Abbahu, and Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi, and Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa, who</b> all <b>say: The young man does not</b> receive an additional <b>share</b> of the inheritance <b>where</b> there are other <b>sons.</b>
<b>Rabbi Abbahu said to Rabbi Yirmeya:</b> Is <b>the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with our</b> opinion, <b>or</b> is <b>the <i>halakha</i> in accordance with your</b> opinion? Rabbi Yirmeya <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abbahu: It is <b>obvious that the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with our</b> opinion, <b>as we are older than you, and the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with your</b> opinion, <b>as you are youngsters [<i>dardekei</i>].</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya in reply: <b>Does the matter depend upon age? The matter depends upon the reason</b> behind the ruling. Rabbi Yirmeya asked him: <b>And what is</b> your <b>reason?</b> Rabbi Abbahu replied: <b>Go to Rabbi Avin, as I explained</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>to him,</b>

Daf 143a

<b>and he nodded [<i>vekharkeish</i>] his head</b> in <b>the study hall</b> in approval <b>of this</b> explanation. Rabbi Yirmeya <b>went to</b> Rabbi Avin, who <b>said to him:</b> Rabbi Abbahu’s reasoning is that <b>if</b> a father <b>said to</b> his son: <b>Acquire</b> an item <b>as a donkey</b> does, <b>does he acquire</b> it? In the same manner that the son would not acquire anything if his acquisition were likened to that of a donkey, which possesses no ability to acquire an item, so too, since the father compared the son’s acquisition to the acquisition effected by his unborn children, who possess no ability to acquire property, the son did not acquire any property.
This is <b>as it was stated:</b> With regard to one who says to another: <b>Acquire</b> an item <b>as a donkey</b> does, he <b>does not acquire</b> any property, as a donkey cannot acquire property. But with regard to one who says: <b>You and a donkey</b> shall both acquire my property, there is a disagreement. <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> The person <b>acquires</b> his <b>half</b> of the property, <b>and Rav Hamnuna says:</b> It is as though the giver <b>does not say anything.</b> Since the beneficiary was included with the donkey in the same acquisition, he does not acquire any property, just as the donkey does not acquire any property. <b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> The person <b>acquires all</b> the property. As the giver knew that a donkey cannot acquire property, he intended for the person, who was capable of acquiring property, to acquire all the property.
<b>Rav Sheshet said: From where do I say this? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Yosei says: There is nothing bitter in the cucumber other than its inner</b> part, which is sometimes bitter and inedible and unfit to be separated as <i>teruma</i>. <b>Therefore,</b> since one does not know if the cucumber he separates as <i>teruma</i> is bitter inside, <b>when he separates <i>teruma</i>,</b> he <b>adds</b> part of another cucumber as <i>teruma</i>, in addition <b>to the outer</b> part <b>of</b> the cucumber, which is edible. <b>And he separates</b> both <b>as <i>teruma</i>,</b> thereby ensuring that the <i>teruma</i> consists of sufficient edible cucumber.
Rav Sheshet asks: <b>Why</b> does the separation of <i>teruma</i> take effect? <b>Is it</b> not analogous to one who states: <b>You and a donkey</b> shall acquire an item, since he designated as <i>teruma</i> both the outer part of the cucumber, which is fit to become <i>teruma</i>, and the inedible inner part, which is not fit to become <i>teruma</i>? Since this does not invalidate the separation of <i>teruma</i> with regard to the edible outer part, one can infer that although the donkey cannot acquire property, this does not prevent the person from acquiring the property.
The Gemara replies: <b>It is different there, as by Torah law</b> the bitter inner part <b>is</b> also <b>properly</b> considered <b><i>teruma</i>,</b> even though by rabbinic law if one separated inferior produce as <i>teruma</i> he must again separate produce of superior quality as <i>teruma</i>. Therefore, when one designates the entire cucumber as <i>teruma</i>, he is not designating both fit and unfit produce.
This is <b>as Rabbi Ile’a says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to one who separates <i>teruma</i> from poor-</b>quality produce <b>for superior-</b>quality produce is <b>that his <i>teruma</i> is</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>?</b> It is <b>as it is stated</b> with regard to <i>teruma</i>: <b>“And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, seeing that you have set apart from it the best thereof”</b> (Numbers 18:32). By inference, this indicates that it is a transgression to separate the inferior part of the produce as <i>teruma</i>. Rabbi Ile’a explains the proof: <b>And if</b> the inferior produce <b>is not sanctified</b> as <i>teruma</i>, <b>why</b> does it involve the <b>bearing of sin,</b> as it is a meaningless act? <b>From here</b> one can derive that <b>that</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>one who separates <i>teruma</i> from poor</b>-quality produce <b>for superior-</b>quality produce is <b>that</b> although he acted improperly, <b>his <i>teruma</i> is</b> valid <b><i>teruma</i>.</b>
§ The Gemara cited Rav Hamnuna’s opinion that if one says: You and a donkey shall acquire my property, he did not say anything. <b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: Rav Avya raises an objection</b> to Rav Hamnuna’s opinion from a mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 50b): <b>An incident</b> occurred <b>involving five women, and among them</b> were <b>two sisters, and one person gathered a basket of figs that belonged to them, and</b> the fruit <b>was of</b> the <b>Sabbatical</b> Year, <b>and he said: You are hereby all betrothed to me with this basket, and one of them accepted</b> it <b>on behalf of all of them. The Sages said: The sisters are not betrothed,</b> as it is prohibited to marry the sister of one’s wife during her lifetime.
One can infer from the mishna: <b>It is</b> only the <b>sisters who are not betrothed, but</b> the <b>unrelated women</b> are <b>betrothed. But why</b> is that so? <b>It is</b> analogous to one who states: <b>You and a donkey</b> shall acquire an item. Since he tried to betroth two women ineligible for betrothal together with the eligible women, the betrothal should not take effect even with regard to the eligible women.
Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Mordekhai: <b>This is why I saw Rav Huna bar Avya in a dream, because</b> you were going to tell me that <b>Rav Avya raised an objection</b> to Rav Hamnuna’s opinion. But as for this objection, <b>didn’t we interpret</b> the mishna in <i>Kiddushin</i> as referring to <b>where he says: Those of you who are eligible for</b> engaging in <b>sexual intercourse</b> with me <b>shall be betrothed to me?</b> Since the sisters were forbidden to him, they were not included in the betrothal in the first place, and there was no impediment to the betrothal of the eligible women taking effect. The case is therefore not comparable to the case discussed by Rav Hamnuna.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who said to his wife: My property is given to you and to your sons. Rav Yosef says:</b> In such a case, the wife <b>acquires half</b> of the property, even though the man did not specify how much of his property he was giving her. <b>And Rav Yosef said: From where do I say this? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> The verse states with regard to the shewbread: <b>“And it shall be for Aaron and his sons”</b> (Leviticus 24:9). This means <b>half for Aaron</b> and <b>half for his sons.</b> One can infer from the <i>baraita</i> that when it is specified that a gift is to be divided between an individual and a group, the intention is that the individual receives half.
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Granted, there,</b> in the case of the shewbread, <b>Aaron is eligible to receive a share</b> of the shewbread as a priest; it is <b>for this</b> reason that <b>the Merciful One specified him</b> separately, so <b>that he should take</b> more than other priests, i.e., <b>half.</b> But with regard to <b>a woman, who is not eligible to inherit</b> her husband’s property, <b>it is sufficient for her to receive</b> a portion of the inheritance <b>as one of the sons,</b> not half of all the property.
The Gemara raises an objection: <b>Is that so? But there was an incident in Neharde’a</b> where a man gave a gift to an individual and to a group of people, <b>and Shmuel collected half</b> the sum for the individual. There was a similar case <b>in Tiberias, and Rabbi Yoḥanan collected half</b> the sum for the individual. <b>And furthermore, when Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef came</b> from Eretz Yisrael <b>he said:</b> There was <b>a certain coronation tax that was placed by the royal house on the city councilmen [<i>a’abulei</i>] and on the prominent citizens [<i>ve’a’isterugei</i>]. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said: Let the city councilmen give half and the prominent citizens half.</b> This indicates that when two groups are mentioned together, the intent is that each one represents half.
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>How can</b> the case concerning the tax <b>be compared</b> to the other cases? <b>There, initially, when they would write</b> the writ of assessment, <b>they would write</b> that it was placed <b>on the city councilmen</b> alone. <b>And the prominent citizens would assist them</b> in raising the sum, <b>and the king knew that they were assisting</b> them. Therefore, <b>now,</b> the meaning of <b>what they wrote:</b> It is placed <b>on the city councilmen and on the prominent citizens, is to say that these</b> should give <b>half</b> of the tax, <b>and those</b> should give <b>half.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises an objection</b> to Rav Yosef’s ruling from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Menaḥot</i> 12:7): With regard to <b>one who says: It is</b> incumbent <b>upon me</b> to bring <b>a meal-offering</b> of <b>one hundred tenths</b> of an ephah <b>in two vessels, he brings sixty-</b>tenths <b>in one vessel, and</b> the remaining <b>forty-</b>tenths <b>in one vessel,</b> as no more than sixty-tenths may be brought in a single vessel.

Daf 143b

<b>And if he brought fifty-</b>tenths <b>in one vessel and fifty in one vessel, he fulfilled</b> his obligation. One can infer from the <i>baraita</i> that after the fact, <b>if he</b> had <b>brought</b> fifty-tenths in each vessel, <b>yes,</b> he fulfilled his obligation, but he may <b>not</b> do so <b><i>ab initio</i>. And if it should enter your mind</b> to say that <b>every case like this is</b> divided <b>half and half,</b> it should be permitted to divide the meal-offering into equal halves <b>even <i>ab initio</i>.</b>
The Gemara dismisses Rabbi Zeira’s objection: <b>How can</b> these cases <b>be compared? There,</b> in the case of the meal-offering, <b>it is clear to us that this person initially intended to</b> bring <b>a large offering, and</b> the reason <b>that he said</b> he will bring the offering <b>in two vessels</b> was <b>that he knew that it is not possible to bring</b> the entire offering <b>in a single vessel.</b> Therefore, <b>we bring,</b> in a single vessel, <b>as much as</b> it <b>is possible to bring,</b> which is sixty-tenths. In any other case it is possible that the division should be into two equal portions.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Yosef</b> in three matters where he disagreed with Rabba: <b>In</b> the matter of dividing <b>a field</b> between brothers (see 12b); in the matter of whether certain actions are limited by the court session or by the <b>topic</b> of discussion in the court (see 114a); <b>and</b> in the matter of <b>half,</b> i.e., this matter, whether an unspecified division into two parts is divided into two equal halves.
§ The Gemara cites additional incidents concerning a gift whose method of division was not specified: There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who sent swaths of silk to his home</b> as a gift. <b>Rabbi Ami says</b> that in such a case, <b>those</b> swaths that are <b>suitable for</b> the <b>sons’</b> garments are given <b>to the sons,</b> and those that are <b>suitable for</b> the <b>daughters’</b> garments are given <b>to the daughters.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>We said this only when he does not have daughters-in-law, but if he has daughters-in-law,</b> it is presumed that <b>he sent</b> it <b>for his daughters-in-law. And if his daughters are not married,</b> it is presumed that <b>he does not forsake his daughters and send to his daughters-in-law,</b> so the silk is given to his daughters.
There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who said to</b> those surrounding him: I leave <b>my property to my sons [<i>levanai</i>],</b> and <b>he had</b> only <b>a son and a daughter.</b> The question was raised: <b>Do people call</b> a single <b>son</b> in the plural: <b>My sons, and</b> in his will <b>he came to remove his daughter</b> even <b>from the tenth</b> of his property that would rightfully be her dowry? <b>Or perhaps people do not call</b> a single <b>son: My sons, and he came to include</b> his <b>daughter in the gift?</b>
<b>Abaye said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof that one does refer to a single son using the plural term sons, as it is written: <b>“And the sons of Dan: Hushim”</b> (Genesis 46:23). <b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>Perhaps</b> this verse should be understood <b>as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught,</b> that Hushim is not the name of Dan’s son but <b>that they,</b> Dan’s sons, <b>were as numerous as</b> the <b>groups [<i>ḥushim</i>] of reeds. Rather, Rava said:</b> One can prove this usage of the term sons in the verse: <b>“And the sons of Pallu: Eliab”</b> (Numbers 26:8). <b>Rav Yosef said:</b> This can be proven from another verse: <b>“And the sons of Ethan: Azariah”</b> (I Chronicles 2:8).
There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who said to</b> those surrounding him: I leave <b>my property to my sons,</b> and <b>he had a son and a grandson,</b> i.e., his son’s son. The question was raised: Do <b>people call a grandson a son, or</b> do they <b>not? Rav Ḥaviva said: People call a grandson a son. Mar bar Rav Ashi said: People do not call a grandson a son.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Mar bar Rav Ashi:</b> With regard to <b>one prohibited by a vow from deriving benefit from</b> a certain person’s <b>sons,</b> it is <b>permitted</b> for him to derive benefit <b>from</b> the <b>sons of</b> that person’s <b>sons,</b> as they are not included in the term sons.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who</b> died and <b>left</b> behind <b>adult and minor sons,</b> if <b>the adult</b> sons <b>enhanced the property, they enhanced</b> it so that the profit goes <b>to the middle,</b> i.e., it is distributed among all the heirs. <b>If</b> the adult sons <b>said</b> from the outset: <b>See that which</b> our <b>father left</b> behind; <b>we are</b> going to <b>engage</b> in business with our share of the property <b>and profit</b> from it, then <b>they enhanced</b> the property <b>for themselves. And similarly,</b> with regard to <b>a wife who enhanced the property</b> of her deceased husband, <b>she enhanced</b> it so that the profit goes <b>to the middle,</b> i.e., it is divided between her and the heirs. <b>If she said: See that which my husband left me; I am</b> going to <b>engage</b> in business with my share <b>and profit</b> from it, then <b>she enhanced</b> the property <b>for herself.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Ḥaviva, son of Rav Yosef, son of Rava, says in the name of Rava: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to <b>where the property was enhanced on account of the property,</b> i.e., the heirs invested money from the common inheritance in order to enhance the property, and their input was only in the management of its investment. <b>But</b> if the <b>property was enhanced on their account,</b> i.e., on account of the efforts or expenditure of the adult sons, the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>they enhanced</b> it <b>for themselves.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is that so? But doesn’t Rabbi Ḥanina say: Even</b> if <b>their father left them nothing but</b>

Daf 144a

<b>a mortar [<i>udaini</i>],</b> which people pay to use, <b>the rent</b> goes <b>to the middle? But isn’t</b> the profit accruing from <b>a mortar</b> considered profit accruing <b>on his,</b> i.e., the adult son’s, <b>own account,</b> as the adult son must supervise its operation, and there is no outlay from the property? The Gemara dismisses this objection: <b>A mortar is different, as for</b> its <b>typical use</b> it can suffice <b>with supervision, and even minors are able to supervise its</b> use. Since the adults do not contribute anything more than the minors, they cannot demand a greater share of the profits.
§ The mishna teaches: If the adult sons <b>said</b> from the outset: <b>See that which</b> our <b>father left</b> behind; <b>we are</b> going to <b>engage</b> in business with our share of the property <b>and profit</b> from it, then <b>they enhanced</b> the property <b>for themselves.</b> The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Safra’s father left</b> him <b>dinars.</b> Rav Safra <b>took them</b> and <b>entered</b> into <b>a business venture with them. His brothers came</b> and <b>charged him in</b> a court of <b>law before Rava,</b> claiming their share of the profits. Rava <b>said to them: Rav Safra is a great man; he does not abandon his studies and toil for others.</b> It is therefore clear that if he invested the money, it was for his own profit, even if he did not explicitly declare so at the outset.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>a wife who enhanced the property</b> of her deceased husband, <b>she enhanced</b> it so that the profit goes <b>to the middle.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the deceased’s <b>wife doing with</b> the <b>orphans’ property?</b> What rights does she have to the property? <b>Rav Yirmeya said:</b> The mishna is referring <b>to a wife</b> who is <b>an heiress,</b> e.g., if she were the daughter of her husband’s brother, and both brothers died without leaving sons, in which case she inherits in her father’s stead.
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the <i>halakha</i> in this case is the same as with regard to any other heir? The Gemara replies: It is necessary to state this, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>since it is not</b> a woman’s <b>way to toil</b> to enhance property, then <b>even though she did not expressly state</b> that she is toiling for herself, <b>it is considered as though</b> she <b>had expressly stated</b> this. The mishna <b>teaches us</b> that only if she expressly stated this do the profits accrue to her.
The mishna teaches: <b>And if she said: See that which my husband left me; I am</b> going to <b>engage</b> in business with my share <b>and profit</b> from it, then <b>she enhanced</b> the property <b>for herself.</b> The Gemara asks: Isn’t this <b>obvious?</b> The Gemara explains: It is necessary to state this, <b>lest you say</b> that <b>since</b> it <b>is praiseworthy for her</b> to enhance the property on behalf of the orphans, <b>as</b> people will <b>say:</b> See how <b>she toils for the orphans, she relinquishes</b> her right to the profits and they should divide them equally. The mishna <b>teaches us</b> that this is not the case.
<b>Rabbi Ḥanina says:</b> In the case of <b>one who marries a woman to his eldest son</b> and arranges the wedding feast <b>in a house</b> that he designated for the purpose of the wedding canopy and the wedding feast, the son <b>acquires</b> the house as a gift. The Gemara notes: <b>And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>specifically</b> in the case of the <b>eldest</b> son, <b>and specifically</b> if he is marrying <b>a virgin, and specifically</b> when this woman is <b>his first wife, and specifically when</b> the father <b>married him off first</b> among his sons. When all these conditions exist, it is presumed that the father has a particular fondness toward the son, due to which he gave him the house.
The Gemara clarifies the details of this <i>halakha</i>: It is <b>obvious</b> that if <b>his father designated a house for</b> the son’s nuptials <b>and</b> there is <b>an upper story</b> above the house, the son <b>acquired the house,</b> but <b>he did not acquire the upper story.</b> If he designated <b>a house</b> for the son, <b>and</b> there is <b>a portico [<i>ve’akhsadra</i>]</b> in front of the house, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If there were <b>two houses, one within the other,</b> and the inner one was designated for the son’s nuptials, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara concludes: These questions <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>his father designated a house and furniture for his</b> son’s nuptials, the son <b>acquired the furniture,</b> but <b>he did not acquire the house. Rabbi Yirmeya says:</b> This is referring to a case <b>where his father’s storeroom was placed there.</b> It is clear that just as his father did not intend to give him the storeroom, neither did he intend to give him the house. The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: Even</b> if there is only <b>a dovecote</b> in the house that belongs to the father, the son does not acquire the house. <b>Rav Yehuda and Rav Pappi say: Even</b> if there is only <b>a pot [<i>atzitza</i>] of</b> small <b>fried fish,</b> the son does not acquire the house. <b>Mar Zutra married off his son, and hung a sandal</b> in the house, to indicate that he did not intend to give the house as a gift. <b>Rav Ashi married off his son, and hung a jug [<i>ashisha</i>] of oil</b> in the house.
<b>Mar Zutra says: These three matters were instituted by the Sages as a <i>halakha</i> without any explanation</b> of their process, i.e., they instituted these enactments despite the fact that the mechanism by which they function is unclear: <b>One</b> is <b>this</b> <i>halakha</i> with regard to the son acquiring the house designated for his nuptials. <b>Another</b> is that <b>which Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: One who writes</b> a deed granting <b>all</b> of <b>his property to his wife renders her only a steward</b> of his property, i.e., he intends only to put her in charge of the property and she does not acquire it. <b>Another</b> is that <b>which Rav says:</b> With regard to one who says to another: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession; give it to so-and-so,</b> if this occurred <b>in the presence of</b> all <b>three</b> parties, that third person <b>acquires</b> it, without need of witnesses or a formal act of acquisition.

Daf 144b

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>brothers who were</b> also <b>partners,</b> and it occurred <b>that one of them was summoned to</b> public <b>service,</b> which is assessed per family, <b>he was summoned from the middle,</b> i.e., the profits or expenses of his service are divided among them. If one of the brothers <b>became sick and sought treatment, the</b> cost of the <b>treatment is</b> paid <b>from his own</b> resources.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Sages <b>taught: This service</b> mentioned in the mishna is referring <b>to</b> forced <b>imperial service,</b> but if one of the brothers engaged in a trade of his own volition, the profits are his alone. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:5): In the case of <b>one of the brothers who was appointed</b> as <b>a tax collector or a military commander [<i>polmustos</i>],</b> a position with the potential for profit, <b>if</b> he was appointed <b>on account of</b> all <b>the brothers,</b> as the procedure was to impress a representative from each family for this purpose, any profit accrues <b>to</b> all <b>the brothers. If</b> he was appointed <b>on account of himself,</b> the profit accrues <b>to himself.</b>
The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that <b>if</b> he was appointed <b>on account of</b> all <b>the brothers,</b> then the profit accrues <b>to</b> all <b>the brothers?</b> The Gemara responds: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> in a case <b>where</b> the brother appointed was <b>sharper,</b> i.e., more capable, than the other brothers. <b>Lest you say</b> that <b>his sharpness caused him</b> to be selected for the position, and he should receive all the profits, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that his talent notwithstanding, since he was selected as a representative of the family, the profit accrues to all the brothers.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> With regard to <b>one of the brothers, who took two hundred dinars</b> from the common inheritance to support himself when he went to another place <b>to study Torah or to learn a trade, the brothers can say to him: If you are</b> here <b>with us, you are entitled to sustenance</b> along with us. <b>If you are not</b> here <b>with us, you are not entitled to sustenance.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But shouldn’t they give him</b> his sustenance <b>wherever he is?</b> The Gemara answers: This ruling <b>supports</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Huna, as Rav Huna says: The blessing of the house</b> is <b>in its abundance.</b> This means that the extent to which blessing permeates a home is proportionate to the number of people who live there, and when many people live together the expenses per capita decrease. The Gemara asks: <b>But shouldn’t they give him</b> his sustenance <b>according to the blessing of the house,</b> i.e., the expenses he would incur even if he were in the house? The Gemara responds: <b>Indeed,</b> they are required to provide for those expenses that he would incur in any event.
§ The mishna teaches: If one of the brothers <b>became sick and sought treatment, the</b> cost of the <b>treatment is</b> paid <b>from his own</b> resources. <b>Ravin sent</b> a ruling <b>in the name of Rabbi Ela: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> in a case <b>where he became ill through negligence. But</b> if he became ill <b>through circumstances beyond his control,</b> the cost of <b>the treatment is</b> paid <b>from the middle,</b> i.e., from the common inheritance. The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances in</b> which it is considered <b>negligence?</b> This is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina says: All</b> occurrences that befall man <b>are in the hand of Heaven except for colds</b> and <b>obstacles [<i>paḥim</i>],</b> from which one is able to protect himself, <b>as</b> it <b>is stated: “Colds and snares are on the path of the crooked; he who guards his soul shall keep far from them”</b> (Proverbs 22:5).
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> It was common practice for friends of a groom to give him gifts in order to help cover the expenses of the wedding feast. These gifts are known as gifts of groomsmen, and would be reciprocated in turn. While the groom and the groomsman were at times the recipient and the giver of the gifts, respectively, the gifts were at times provided by the father of the groomsman and received by the father of the groom. In the case of <b>brothers, some of whom brought gifts of groomsmen in their father’s lifetime,</b> which were provided by their father, when <b>the gifts of groomsmen are reciprocated</b> after the father’s death, when one of the brothers gets married, <b>they are reciprocated to the middle,</b> i.e., the gift is divided among the brothers. This is <b>because gifts of groomsmen are</b> a legal debt owed to the father, <b>collectible in court. But</b> with regard to <b>one who sends his friend jugs of wine or jugs of oil,</b> a reciprocal gift <b>is not collectible in court, because they are</b> considered <b>acts of kindness.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> between the mishna’s ruling that the gifts of groomsmen are reciprocated to the middle, and the first clause of a <i>baraita</i>: If <b>a father sent</b> his son with <b>gifts of groomsmen, when they are reciprocated</b> when that son gets married, <b>they are reciprocated to</b> that son. If <b>his father was sent gifts of groomsmen</b> for the wedding of one of his sons, <b>when they are reciprocated</b> from the father’s estate, <b>they are reciprocated from the middle,</b> i.e., the cost of the gift is divided among the brothers. <b>Rabbi Asi says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: When we learned the mishna as well, we learned</b> it as teaching the <i>halakha</i> with regard to gifts of groomsmen that <b>were sent to</b> the <b>father</b> for the wedding of one of his sons, not with regard to gifts of groomsmen sent by the father.
The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>brothers, some of whom brought gifts of groomsmen.</b> The Gemara responds: Emend the text of the mishna and <b>teach</b> it as saying: With regard to brothers, <b>to some of whom</b> gifts of groomsmen were brought. The Gemara objects: <b>But</b> the mishna explicitly <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> if <b>the gifts of groomsmen are reciprocated.</b> The Gemara responds: <b>This is</b> what the mishna <b>is saying: When it is collected</b> from the brothers <b>in return, it is collected from</b> the <b>middle.</b>
<b>Rabbi Asi says:</b> Even if the text of the mishna is not emended, it is <b>not difficult</b> and can be reconciled with the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Here</b> in the mishna it is referring to where the father sent the gifts of groomsmen <b>without specifying</b> which son should be ascribed credit for bringing the gifts. <b>There</b> in the <i>baraita</i>, it is referring to <b>where</b> the father <b>specified</b> that the credit for the gifts of groomsmen should be ascribed to a specific son, who receives gifts in return, <b>as it is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: If <b>his father sent gifts of groomsmen on his,</b> i.e., the son’s, behalf, then <b>when</b> the gift <b>is reciprocated, it is reciprocated to him,</b> i.e., to that specific son. If <b>his father sent gifts of groomsmen without specification,</b> then <b>when</b> the gift <b>is reciprocated, it is reciprocated to the middle.</b>
<b>And Shmuel says: Here</b> in the mishna <b>we are dealing with a man whose married brother died childless [<i>yavam</i>].</b> The son who brought the gifts of groomsmen died childless, his brother entered into levirate marriage with the widow, and the gifts of groomsmen were reciprocated at the wedding of the <i>yavam</i>. Although the <i>yavam</i> inherits the property of his brother, since the reciprocal gifts were not extant when his brother died, they do not belong solely to him; rather, they are divided among the brothers. This is because the <i>yavam</i> <b>does not take</b> in inheritance the property <b>due</b> the deceased <b>as</b> he does the property the deceased already <b>possessed.</b>
The Gemara asks: Is it possible to conclude <b>by inference</b> from Shmuel’s statement <b>that the other</b> side, i.e., a friend who had received gifts of groomsmen from the deceased, is obligated to <b>repay</b> the gifts of groomsmen he received from the deceased? Why should this be so? <b>Let him say: Give me my groomsman and I will rejoice with him.</b> Since the one who gave him the gifts is deceased, he is not obligated to reciprocate.
<b>Isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Pesaḥim</i> 3:1) with regard to similar circumstances: In <b>a place where</b> people <b>are accustomed to return the betrothal</b> money when the betrothed man or woman dies, <b>they return</b> it; in <b>a place where</b> people <b>are accustomed not to return</b> it, <b>they do not return</b> it. <b>And Rav Yosef bar Abba says</b> that <b>Mar Ukva says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: They taught</b> this <b>only</b> with regard to <b>when</b> the woman <b>dies,</b> in which case one follows the local custom. <b>But if</b> the man <b>dies,</b> all agree that <b>they do not return</b> the money. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? Since <b>she can say:</b>

Daf 145a

<b>Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him,</b> i.e., it is not my fault that we are not getting married, she is not required to return the betrothal money. <b>Here too, let him say: Give me my groomsman and I will rejoice with him.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef said: With what are we dealing here?</b> Shmuel’s statement is referring to a case <b>where</b> the original recipient, in reciprocation, <b>rejoiced with</b> the brother who brought the gifts of groomsmen during the <b>seven days of</b> the wedding <b>feast, but did not suffice to repay him before</b> the brother <b>died.</b> Since it was the usual practice to send the gifts of groomsmen after the groomsman rejoiced with the betrothed man for seven days, he is obligated to reciprocate the gifts of groomsmen, and the <i>yavam</i> cannot claim them for himself.
The Gemara suggests: <b>Shall we say</b> that Shmuel’s statement that a betrothed woman can claim: <b>Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him, is</b> a dispute between <b><i>tanna’im</i>? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who betrothed a woman</b> and then he divorces her or dies, if she is <b>a virgin,</b> she <b>collects two hundred</b> dinars in payment of her marriage contract. <b>And</b> if she is <b>a widow,</b> she collects <b>one hundred dinars.</b> In <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed to return the betrothal</b> money when the betrothed man or woman died, <b>they return</b> it. In <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed not to return the betrothal</b> money, <b>they do not return</b> it. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Natan. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says: Actually they said:</b> In <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed to return</b> it, <b>they return</b> it; in <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed not to return</b> it, <b>they do not return</b> it.
The Gemara clarifies: The opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is</b> identical to the opinion of <b>the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> i.e., Rabbi Natan. <b>Rather, is it not</b> that the difference <b>between them</b> concerns the validity of the claim: <b>Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him?</b>
<b>And</b> the statement in the <i>baraita</i> <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching:</b> With regard to <b>one who betrothed a woman</b> and then the betrothal is terminated, if she is <b>a virgin,</b> she <b>collects two hundred</b> dinars in payment of her marriage contract, <b>and</b> if she is <b>a widow,</b> she collects <b>one hundred dinars. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said?</b> It is said <b>where he retracted,</b> i.e., he died or divorced her. <b>But</b> with regard to where <b>she died,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: In <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed to return</b> the betrothal money, <b>they return</b> it; in <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed not to return</b> the betrothal money, <b>they do not return</b> it. <b>And</b> this applies <b>specifically</b> to <b>where she died; but</b> if <b>he died, they do not return</b> it. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? It is because <b>she can say: Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him.</b> This is the statement of Rabbi Natan.
<b>And Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi came to say: Actually they said: Whether he died or whether she died,</b> in <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed to return</b> it, <b>they return</b> it; in <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed not to return</b> it, <b>they do not return</b> it, <b>and she cannot say: Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him.</b>
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>No, everyone</b> agrees that <b>she can say: Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him, and</b> in a case <b>where he died, everyone agrees</b> that she does not have to return the betrothal money. <b>They disagree</b> in a case <b>where she died, and here</b> it is <b>with regard to</b> the question of whether <b>betrothal</b> money <b>is given as a sunk</b> cost, i.e., that it is not returned even if the betrothal is not consummated, that <b>they disagree. Rabbi Natan holds</b> that <b>betrothal</b> money <b>is not given as a sunk</b> cost, and in a place where people were accustomed to return it, they return it. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds</b> that <b>betrothal</b> money <b>is given as a sunk</b> cost.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teach</b> that according to Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi, in <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed to return</b> it, <b>they return</b> it? This indicates that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi does not hold that the betrothal money was given as a sunk cost. The Gemara replies: This is not referring to the betrothal money, which is not returned in any event. <b>This is</b> what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying: But</b> with regard to <b>presents,</b> which the betrothed man sent his betrothed following the betrothal, <b>certainly</b> in <b>a place where</b> people <b>were accustomed to return</b> them, <b>they return</b> them.
The Gemara notes: The dispute between <b>these <i>tanna’im</i>,</b> in the following <i>baraita</i>, <b>is like</b> the dispute between <b>those <i>tanna’im</i></b> just mentioned, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where the man <b>betrothed</b> a woman <b>with a talent</b> of silver, equivalent to six thousand dinars, if she was <b>a virgin</b> she <b>collects</b> in payment of her marriage contract <b>two hundred</b> dinars over and above this amount, <b>and</b> if she was <b>a widow</b> she collects <b>one hundred dinars</b> over and above this amount. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda says: A virgin collects two hundred</b> dinars <b>and a widow one hundred dinars, and she returns the rest</b> of the betrothal money <b>to him. Rabbi Yosei says:</b> If <b>he betrothed her with twenty, he gives her thirty halves;</b> if <b>he betrothed her with thirty, he gives her twenty halves,</b> as the Gemara will explain.
The Gemara clarifies the <i>baraita</i>: <b>With what are we dealing? If we say</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>when she died, is she entitled</b> to receive payment of her <b>marriage contract? Rather,</b> perhaps the <i>baraita</i> is referring to <b>where he died,</b> in which case <b>why</b> does Rabbi Yehuda state that <b>she returns the rest</b> of the betrothal money <b>to him? Let her say: Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him. Rather,</b> perhaps the <i>baraita</i> is referring to the case <b>of the wife,</b> i.e., the betrothed, <b>of an Israelite, who committed adultery,</b> who cannot claim that she is available to marry her betrothed, as it is prohibited for her to engage in intercourse with him. The Gemara challenges: This is also difficult, as <b>with what</b> circumstance is the <i>baraita</i> dealing? <b>If</b> it is referring to <b>where</b> she committed adultery <b>willingly, is she entitled</b> to receive payment of her <b>marriage contract? Rather,</b> it is referring <b>to</b> a case of <b>rape.</b> But in that case, she <b>is permitted to him.</b> Why should she return the betrothal money?
<b>Rather,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to the wife,</b> i.e., the betrothed, <b>of a priest, who was raped</b> and is prohibited from engaging in intercourse with her betrothed. She therefore cannot claim: Give me my husband and I will rejoice with him, yet she is entitled to receive payment of her marriage contract, <b>and</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>betrothal</b> money <b>is given as a sunk</b> cost: <b>Rabbi Meir holds that betrothal</b> money <b>is given as a sunk</b> cost. <b>Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that it <b>is not given as a sunk</b> cost. <b>And Rabbi Yosei is uncertain if</b> it <b>is given as a sunk</b> cost <b>or not.</b>
The Gemara explains Rabbi Yosei’s opinion: <b>And</b> since it is uncertain whether or not she is required to return the betrothal money, <b>therefore,</b> she returns only half the money: If <b>he betrothed her with twenty</b> <i>sela</i>, which are equivalent to eighty dinars, she owes him forty dinars. Yet, if she is widowed or divorced, she is entitled to one hundred dinars in payment of her marriage contract, so he or his estate <b>gives her thirty halves</b> of a <i>sela</i>, which are equivalent to sixty dinars, so that she receives one hundred dinars in all. If <b>he betrothed her with thirty</b> <i>sela</i>, which are equivalent to one hundred twenty dinars, she owes him sixty dinars. Since she is entitled to one hundred dinars in payment of her marriage contract, he <b>gives her twenty halves</b> of a <i>sela</i>, equivalent to forty dinars.
<b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: In every place where they were accustomed to return</b> the betrothal money, <b>they return</b> it. <b>And the interpretation</b> of this statement is that it is referring to <b>Neharde’a.</b> The Gemara asks: With regard to <b>the rest of Babylonia, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both say:</b> The <b>presents are returned</b> and the <b>betrothal</b> money <b>is not returned. Rav Pappa said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>whether he died</b> or <b>whether she died or</b> whether <b>he retracted</b> his agreement to the betrothal and divorced her, the <b>presents are returned</b> and the <b>betrothal</b> money <b>is not returned.</b> If <b>she retracted</b> her agreement to the betrothal and requested a divorce, <b>even</b> the <b>betrothal</b> money <b>is returned.</b>
<b>Ameimar said:</b> The <b>betrothal</b> money <b>is not returned.</b> This is a rabbinic <b>decree, lest</b> people <b>say</b> that <b>betrothal takes effect with her sister.</b> If the betrothal money is returned, people are likely to think that the betrothal is retroactively nullified and that the man can betroth her sister, whereas in fact the betrothal was not retroactively nullified and he cannot betroth her. <b>Rav Ashi said: Her bill of divorce proves for her</b> that she was betrothed, so this concern is not in effect. The Gemara comments: <b>And this</b> statement <b>of Rav Ashi is a mistake, since there are</b> those <b>who heard about this,</b> i.e., the return of the betrothal money, <b>but did not hear about that,</b> i.e., the bill of divorce.
§ The mishna teaches: If the gifts of groomsmen are reciprocated after the father’s death, they are reciprocated to the middle, <b>because gifts of groomsmen are</b> a legal debt owed to the father, <b>collectible in court. The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:8): <b>Five statements were said with regard to gifts of groomsmen:</b> They are <b>collectible in court; and</b> they are <b>reciprocated</b> only <b>at their</b> relevant <b>time,</b> i.e., at the time of the groomsman’s own wedding; <b>and they are not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>interest,</b> i.e., it is permitted to reciprocate with a gift of greater value than the original gift;

Daf 145b

<b>and the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>does not abrogate them; and the firstborn does not take a double</b> portion <b>of them.</b>
The <i>baraita</i> states that gifts of groomsmen <b>are collectible in court. What is the reason</b> for this? It is that they are considered <b>similar to a loan.</b> The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And they are not subject to</b> the prohibition of <b>interest.</b> The reason is <b>that</b> it was <b>not</b> with <b>that in mind</b> that he gave him a larger gift. Rather, he did so on account of his joy at his friend’s wedding. The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And the Sabbatical</b> Year <b>does not abrogate them.</b> The reason is <b>that one cannot read</b> the verse concerning the abrogation of debts during the occurrence of the Sabbatical Year: <b>“He shall not exact</b> it of his neighbor and his brother, because the Lord’s release has been proclaimed” (Deuteronomy 15:2), <b>with regard to</b> gifts of groomsmen. Since one cannot choose to exact the gifts until the time of one’s own wedding, they are not addressed by this verse.
The <i>baraita</i> states: <b>And the firstborn does not take a double</b> portion from them. The reason is <b>that they constitute potential</b> inheritance, <b>and the firstborn does not take</b> in inheritance the property <b>due</b> the deceased <b>as</b> he does the property the deceased <b>possessed.</b>
§ <b>Rav Kahana said: The principle with regard to</b> the reciprocation of <b>gifts of groomsmen</b> is: If the recipient <b>was in town</b> when his groomsman wed, <b>he should have come</b> to the wedding, and even if he did not come, he is obligated to send the gifts of groomsmen. If he was not in town, but <b>he</b> was nearby and he <b>heard the sound of the drum</b> announcing the wedding, <b>he should have come.</b> If <b>he</b> was far away and <b>did not hear the sound of the drum,</b> the betrothed man <b>should have informed him.</b> If he did not inform him, the recipient <b>has a grievance</b> against the betrothed man because he did not inform him about the wedding, but <b>he</b> still <b>repays</b> the gifts of groomsmen.
In this case, since he did not partake of the wedding feast, he is entitled to deduct a sum from the reciprocal gift. The Gemara asks: <b>And up to how much</b> can he deduct? <b>Abaye said:</b> The <b>members of a wedding</b> feast <b>were accustomed</b> to deduct according to the following principle: If the gift of groomsmen that the reciprocal giver received was <b>up to a dinar,</b> he now pays nothing, because what a person <b>brings in his hand he consumes in his stomach.</b> If the gift of groomsmen was <b>up to four</b> dinars, he now <b>pays half. From that</b> sum <b>onward, each person</b> deducts <b>according to his prominence,</b> i.e., in accordance with the outlay that would have been required to honor the reciprocal giver properly, had he participated in the wedding feast.
<b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 10:9): If one <b>served</b> as groomsman <b>for</b> his friend <b>at a public [<i>pumbei</i>]</b> wedding, <b>and</b> when the groomsman himself wed, he <b>requested</b> that his friend reciprocate <b>by serving</b> as a groomsman <b>for him at a private</b> wedding, the friend <b>can say to him: I</b> am willing to reciprocate and <b>serve</b> as groomsman <b>for you</b> only <b>at a public</b> wedding, where the rejoicing is greater, <b>in the manner you served</b> as a groomsman <b>for me.</b> If one <b>served</b> as a groomsman <b>for</b> his friend <b>when</b> he married <b>a virgin, and</b> he <b>requested</b> that his friend reciprocate <b>by serving</b> as a groomsman <b>for him when</b> he marries <b>a widow,</b> the friend <b>can say to him: I shall serve</b> as a groomsman <b>for you</b> only <b>when</b> you marry <b>a virgin, in the manner you served</b> as a groomsman <b>for me.</b>
If one <b>served</b> as a groomsman <b>for</b> his friend <b>when</b> he married <b>a second</b> wife, <b>and</b> he <b>requested</b> that his friend reciprocate <b>by serving</b> as a groomsman <b>for him when</b> he marries <b>a first</b> wife, the friend <b>can say to him: When you marry another woman I will serve</b> as a groomsman <b>for you.</b> If one <b>served</b> as a groomsman <b>for</b> his friend <b>when</b> he married <b>one</b> woman, <b>and</b> he <b>requested</b> that his friend reciprocate <b>by serving</b> as a groomsman <b>for him when</b> he marries <b>two</b> women, the friend <b>can say to him: I will serve</b> as a groomsman <b>for you when</b> you marry <b>one</b> woman, <b>in the manner you served</b> as a groomsman <b>for me.</b>
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: There are different types of Torah scholars. There is a scholar who is <b>wealthy</b> in figurative <b>property</b> and <b>wealthy</b> in <b>public</b> renown; <b>this is the master of homiletics.</b> There is a scholar who is <b>wealthy</b> in <b>coins</b> and <b>wealthy</b> in <b>houses; this is the master of dialectics.</b> There is one who is <b>wealthy</b> in <b>oil</b> and <b>wealthy</b> in <b>hidden</b> stores; <b>this is the master of</b> halakhic <b>traditions. Everyone is dependent on the owner of wheat;</b> this is the master of <b>Talmud,</b> who understands the reasons behind the rulings and traditions.
<b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav says: What</b> is the meaning of that <b>which is written: “All the days of the poor are terrible;</b> and for the good-hearted it is always a feast” (Proverbs 15:15)? “All the days of the poor are terrible”; <b>this</b> is referring to the <b>master of Talmud,</b> who is wearied by the difficulty of his Talmud study. <b>“And for the good-hearted it is always a feast”; this</b> is referring to the <b>master of Mishna,</b> who recites the <i>mishnayot</i> by rote and is not wearied thereby.
<b>Rava says: The opposite</b> is true. <b>And this is</b> consistent with that <b>which Rav Mesharshiyya says in the name of Rava: What is</b> the meaning of that <b>which is written: “He who quarries stones shall be hurt by them; and he that chops wood shall be warmed thereby”</b> (Ecclesiastes 10:9). <b>“He who quarries stones shall be hurt by them”; these are the masters of Mishna.</b> They exert themselves to memorize the <i>mishnayot</i>, but since one cannot reach practical conclusions from the mishna, they are comparable to one who carries a heavy load without benefiting from it. <b>“He that chops wood shall be warmed thereby”; these are the masters of Talmud,</b> who attain the benefit of their exertions in the form of practical conclusions.
The Gemara cites other interpretations of this verse. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: “All the days of the poor are terrible”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who has a wicked wife. “And for the good-hearted it is always a feast”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who has a good wife. Rabbi Yannai says: “All the days of the poor are terrible”; this</b> is referring to <b>one who is delicate [<i>istenis</i>]</b> and overly sensitive, because he constantly encounters unpleasant situations. <b>“And for the good-hearted it is always a feast”; this</b> is referring to one <b>who is relaxed</b> and not particular with regard to his food or his surroundings.
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: “All the days of the poor are terrible”; this</b> is referring to <b>an empathetic person,</b> because he is constantly affected by the suffering in the world. <b>“And for the good-hearted it is always a feast”; this</b> is referring to <b>a cruel person,</b> who is not pained by the suffering of others. <b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: “All the days of the poor are terrible”; this</b> is referring to a person <b>of impatient disposition. “And for the good-hearted it is always a feast”; this</b> is referring to a person <b>of patient disposition.</b>

Daf 146a

<b>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says:</b> Is it so that <b>all the days of the poor are terrible? But aren’t there <i>Shabbatot</i> and Festivals,</b> when even the poor enjoy their meals and rest? Rather, explain this <b>in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Shmuel, as Shmuel says: A change of regimen [<i>veset</i>]</b> causes <b>the onset of</b> intestinal <b>disease,</b> and as a result the poor suffer even from a change for the good.
It <b>is written in the book of ben Sira: All the days of the poor are terrible. Ben Sira says: The nights as well. His roof is at the lowest point of the roofs; the rain of roofs go onto his roof. His vineyard is at the height of the mountains; the soil of his vineyard goes onto other vineyards.</b>
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who sends presents [<i>sivlonot</i>] to his father-in-law’s house</b> following his betrothal, even if <b>he sent there</b> the sum of <b>ten thousand dinars and</b> subsequently <b>ate there a groom’s feast even</b> worth the value <b>of</b> a single <b>dinar,</b> if for any reason the marriage is not effected, the presents <b>are not collected</b> in return by the formerly betrothed man. If he <b>did not eat a groom’s feast there,</b> the presents <b>are collected,</b> as they were not an unconditional gift. If he <b>sent many presents</b> with the stipulation <b>that they return with her to her husband’s house,</b> i.e., to his own house, after the wedding, <b>these are collected</b> if the marriage is not effected. If he sent <b>a few presents for her to use while in her father’s house, they are not collected.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that if the betrothed man ate food worth even a single dinar at his father-in-law’s house, the presents are not returned. <b>Rava says:</b> This applies <b>specifically</b> to the value of <b>a dinar, but</b> if he ate food worth <b>less than</b> the value of <b>a dinar,</b> it is <b>not</b> so. The Gemara asks: Isn’t that <b>obvious,</b> as <b>we learned</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna with reference to the value of <b>a dinar?</b> The Gemara answers: It is stated <b>lest you say</b> that <b>the same is true even</b> in the case of <b>less than a dinar, and</b> the reason <b>that</b> the mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> with reference to <b>a dinar</b> is that it <b>teaches the matter in the manner in which it</b> typically occurs, and one does not usually eat less than that. Rava therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the formulation of the mishna is precise; the mishna is not referring to the value of less than a dinar.
§ The Gemara asks: <b>We learned</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna with regard to a betrothed man who <b>ate</b> at his father-in-law’s house. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if <b>he drank</b> there? <b>We learned</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna with regard to a case where <b>he,</b> the betrothed, ate there. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if <b>his agent</b> ate there? <b>We learned</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the mishna with regard to a case where the betrothed man ate <b>there,</b> at his father-in-law’s house. <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if his father-in-law <b>sent him</b> a feast to his home?
The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof concerning one these matters, <b>as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> There was <b>an incident involving one man who sent to his father-in-law’s house one hundred wagons</b> full <b>of jars of wine and of jars of oil, and</b> one hundred wagons full <b>of silver vessels, and</b> one hundred wagons full <b>of gold vessels, and</b> one hundred wagons full <b>of garments of fine wool [<i>milat</i>]. And he rode</b> over <b>in his</b> state of <b>joy and went and stood by the entrance to his father-in-law’s house. And they brought out</b> to him <b>a cup of hot</b> drink <b>and he drank</b> it, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>died.</b>
The question arose as to whether the presents must be returned to the betrothed’s heirs. <b>And Rabbi Aḥa Sar HaBira raised this <i>halakha</i> before the Sages in Usha, and they said: Presents that are typically consumed are not collected, and</b> those <b>that are not typically consumed are collected.</b> One can <b>conclude from</b> this incident that <b>even</b> if the betrothed only <b>drank,</b> some of the presents cannot be reclaimed.
The Gemara asks: <b>Can you learn from this</b> incident that the presents cannot be claimed <b>even</b> if he ate or drank <b>less than</b> the value of <b>a dinar,</b> since a cup of hot drink is not worth a dinar? <b>Rav Ashi said: Who shall say to us that they did not grind a pearl worth one thousand dinars and serve it to him to drink?</b> The Gemara asks: <b>Can you learn from this</b> incident that <b>even</b> if <b>they sent</b> the feast <b>to him</b> the presents cannot be claimed, as he drank at the entrance and did not enter inside? The Gemara rejects this conclusion: <b>Perhaps the entire entrance of his father-in-law’s house is considered as his father-in-law’s house.</b>
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Rava states that if the betrothed man ate less than the value of a dinar at his father-in-law’s house, and the marriage is not effected, he can collect the presents he sent. <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>whether he must divide</b> the value of the presents, and claim only part of the value, in proportion to the amount he ate? And <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> concerning <b>the enhancement of</b> the value of <b>the presents?</b> Does one say that <b>since</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>if they are</b> extant <b>they are returned to him,</b> therefore <b>they were enhanced under his ownership? Or perhaps, since</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>if they are lost or stolen,</b> the betrothed woman’s family is <b>required to repay him,</b> therefore <b>they were enhanced under her ownership.</b> The Gemara concludes: These dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rava raises a dilemma: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>presents that are typically consumed, but were not consumed?</b> The Gemara replies: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof: <b>And Rabbi Aḥa Sar HaBira raised this <i>halakha</i> before the Sages at Usha, and they said: Presents that are typically consumed are not collected, and</b> those <b>that are not typically consumed are collected. What, is it not</b> referring to presents that are typically consumed <b>even though they were not consumed?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>No,</b> the mishna is referring to presents <b>that were</b> actually <b>consumed.</b>
The Gemara replies: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: If he sent a <b>few presents for her to use while she is in her father’s house,</b> they <b>are not collected.</b> This indicates that they cannot be collected in any event, irrespective of whether they were used or not. <b>Rava interpreted</b> the mishna as referring <b>to a snood or hairnet,</b> which are insignificant items that the betrothed man sends without any intention of later collecting them.
§ <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> There was <b>an incident involving one man who sent new wine, and new oil, and new linen garments to his father-in-law’s house at the</b> time of <b><i>Shavuot</i>.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is this incident <b>teaching us?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that it <b>teaches us the importance,</b> i.e., the greatness, <b>of Eretz Yisrael,</b> where there is new wine, oil, and linen already available at the time of <i>Shavuot</i>. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead that it teaches <b>that if</b> the betrothed man <b>claims</b> that he sent these items at the time of <i>Shavuot</i>, <b>his claim is</b> a plausible <b>claim,</b> and there is no reason to question it.
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> There was <b>an incident involving one man who was told</b> that <b>his wife,</b> i.e., his betrothed, <b>was one whose sense of smell was impaired, and he followed her into a ruin,</b> carrying a date with him, <b>to check her</b> to see if she could correctly identify the smell. <b>He said to her: I smell</b> the <b>scent of radish in the Galilee.</b>

Daf 146b

<b>She said to him: Who will give us of the dates of Jericho that I shall eat them,</b> hinting that she smelled the date he had brought with him. <b>The ruin collapsed upon her and she died. The Sages said: Since he went into</b> the ruin <b>after her only to check her</b> sense of smell, and not for the purpose of consummating their marriage, if <b>she dies, he does not inherit</b> from <b>her,</b> as the marriage was not effected, and a man does not inherit from his betrothed.
§ The mishna teaches: If he sent <b>a few presents for her to use while in her father’s house,</b> they are not collected. <b>Ravin the Elder was sitting before Rav Pappa and he was sitting and saying: Whether she died, or whether he died,</b> or whether <b>he retracted</b> his agreement to the betrothal and divorced her, the <b>presents return</b> to the betrothed man or his heirs, but <b>food and drink do not return.</b> If <b>she retracted</b> her agreement to the betrothal and requested a divorce, <b>even a bundle of vegetables returns</b> to the betrothed man. <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> When the presents are returned, the court <b>appraises for</b> the betrothed woman’s family the sum that they must repay for any meat he gave her, according <b>to a reduced</b> assessment of the <b>value of</b> the <b>meat</b> and not according to the price the betrothed man paid. <b>How much</b> less is the <b>reduced</b> assessment? <b>Up to one-third</b> less than he paid.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>a person on his death-bed who wrote</b> a deed granting <b>all of his property to others, and he reserved</b> for himself <b>any amount of land, his gift stands</b> even if he subsequently recovers. If <b>he did not reserve</b> for himself <b>any amount of land,</b> and he recovered, <b>his gift does not stand,</b> as the gift was conditional upon his death, since is it evident that he did not intend to leave himself without means of support.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that we follow</b> the principle of <b>assessing</b> a person’s intentions, even when he did not expressly state them? <b>Rav Naḥman said: This is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ketubot</i> 5:9): In a case <b>where one’s son went overseas and he heard that his son died, and</b> then he <b>arose and wrote</b> a document granting <b>all of his property to another, and then his son came</b> back, <b>his gift</b> to the other people <b>is</b> a valid <b>gift. Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya says: His gift is not</b> a valid <b>gift, as had he known that his son</b> was <b>alive he would not have written</b> a document granting <b>them</b> his property.
<b>Rav Sheshet said: This is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri, as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 65b): <b>Initially</b> the Sages <b>would say:</b> With regard to <b>one who was taken out in a collar</b> to be executed <b>and said: Write a bill of divorce for my wife, these</b> people <b>should write and give</b> her the document. Although he did not explicitly say the word give, this is understood to have been his intention, to release her from the necessity to perform levirate marriage or <i>ḥalitza</i>. <b>They then said</b> that this <i>halakha</i> applies <b>even to one who sets sail and one who departs with a caravan</b> to a far-off place. A bill of divorce is given to his wife under these circumstances even if her husband said just: Write. <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri says: Even</b> in the case of <b>one who is dangerously ill</b> who gives that instruction, they write the bill of divorce and give it to his wife.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman does not interpret</b> the mishna as being <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon Shezuri?</b> The Gemara answers: Rav Naḥman holds that it <b>is different there, as he said: Write</b> a bill of divorce, thereby partially stating his intention to divorce her, whereas in the case of the mishna here, he did not express his intention at all. The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>Rav Sheshet does not interpret</b> the mishna as being <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>An assessment</b> of a person’s intentions <b>that is</b> clearly <b>proven is different,</b> and it is possible that Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya does not apply this principle where the person’s intentions are less evident.
The Gemara asks: <b>Who</b> is the <i>tanna</i> who <b>taught that which the Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Ketubot</i> 4:15): If one <b>was ill and bedridden, and</b> those present <b>said to him: To whom</b> shall <b>your property</b> be given? <b>And he said to them:</b>

Daf 147a

Previously, I <b>thought that I had a son. Now</b> that I have been informed <b>that I do not have a son, my property</b> shall be given <b>to so-and-so.</b> Or if he <b>was ill and bedridden, and</b> those present <b>said to him: To whom</b> shall <b>his property</b> be given? And <b>he said to them:</b> Previously, I <b>thought that my wife was pregnant. Now</b> that I have been informed <b>that my wife is not pregnant, my property</b> shall be given <b>to so-and-so. And</b> if <b>it</b> then <b>became known,</b> in either of those cases, <b>that he had a son or that his wife was pregnant, his gift is not</b> a valid <b>gift,</b> since he clearly indicated that he bestowed the gift on that recipient only because he thought he had no heir.
The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that <b>this is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Menasya and not</b> the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>You</b> can <b>even say</b> that this is the opinion of <b>the Rabbis,</b> as the case where he said: I <b>thought</b> that I had a son, <b>is different,</b> since he stated the reason for his actions.
Since the difference between the cases is obvious, the Gemara asks: <b>He who asked it, why did he ask it?</b> The Gemara replies: <b>Lest you say</b> that when the bedridden man mentioned that he does not have a son, <b>he is mentioning it</b> only as an expression of <b>his sorrow,</b> since the matter of the disposal of his estate brings it to mind, but he is not mentioning this as the reason for the gift, the <i>baraita</i> therefore <b>teaches us</b> that the reference to his son indicates that had he known that he had a son, he would not have given his property to others.
§ Unlike the gifts of a healthy person, the gifts of a person on his deathbed do not require a formal act of acquisition. <b>Rabbi Zeira says</b> that <b>Rav says: From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> this <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>the gift of a person on his deathbed is by Torah law? As it is stated</b> in the passage delineating the laws of inheritance: “If a man dies, and he does not have a son, <b>then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter”</b> (Numbers 27:8). The term “you shall cause…to pass” is superfluous, as the verse could have stated: His inheritance shall go to his daughter. One can therefore derive from this term that <b>you have another</b> case of <b>causing</b> property <b>to pass</b> to another, <b>which is comparable to this</b> case of inheritance, which does not require an act of acquisition. <b>And what is this</b> case? <b>This is</b> the case of <b>the gift of a person on his deathbed.</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman</b> says that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> with regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed is derived <b>from here:</b> “And if he has no daughter, <b>then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers”</b> (Numbers 27:9). The verse could have stated: His inheritance shall go to his brothers, as inheritance is transferred by itself, without any intervention. One can therefore derive from the term “you shall give” that <b>you have another</b> case of <b>giving that is comparable to this</b> case. <b>And what is this</b> case? <b>This is</b> the case of <b>the gift of a person on his deathbed.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rav Naḥman, what is the reason</b> that he <b>did not say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> can be derived <b>from</b> the term <b>“you shall cause…to pass”?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>He requires that</b> verse <b>for that</b> which is taught <b>by Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says: With regard to all of</b> the heirs, the term <b>giving was stated</b> in the Torah, <b>and here,</b> with regard to the daughter, the term <b>causing to pass was stated.</b> One can derive from this that <b>there is no</b> heir <b>who</b> can <b>cause</b> one’s <b>inheritance to pass from</b> one <b>tribe to</b> another <b>tribe except</b> for the <b>daughter, since her son and her husband inherit</b> from <b>her,</b> and they may be of a different tribe.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> with regard to <b>Rabbi Zeira, what is the reason</b> that <b>he did not say</b> that this <i>halakha</i> can be derived <b>from</b> the term <b>“Then you shall give”?</b> The Gemara answers: Rabbi Zeira maintains that <b>this</b> usage <b>is the</b> usual <b>manner of the verse,</b> and one cannot derive anything from this term.
<b>Rav Menashya bar Yirmeya says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> with regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed is derived <b>from here: “In those days Hezekiah became deathly ill, and Isaiah ben Amoz the prophet came to him, and said to him: So says the Lord: Instruct your household, for you will die, and you will not live”</b> (II Kings 20:1). This indicates that <b>merely by</b> issuing <b>an instruction,</b> a person on his deathbed can transfer ownership of his property.
<b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> with regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed is derived <b>from here: “And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass,</b> and he arose, <b>and went to his home, to his city; and he instructed his household, and strangled himself”</b> (II Samuel 17:23). This indicates that <b>merely by</b> issuing <b>an instruction,</b> a person on his deathbed can transfer ownership of his property.
<b>The Sages taught:</b> Before his death, when he saw that Absalom’s rebellion against King David had failed, <b>Ahithophel instructed his sons</b> with regard to <b>three matters: Do not be</b> participants <b>in a dispute. And do not rebel against the kingship of the house of David. And</b> if <b>the festival of <i>Shavuot</i></b> is <b>a clear</b> day, <b>sow wheat,</b> as it is a sign that the wheat crop will thrive. <b>Mar Zutra said: It was stated</b> that the wheat crop will thrive if <i>Shavuot</i> is <b>a cloudy</b> day, not if it is a clear day. The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say in the name of Rabbi Ya’akov:</b> According to both opinions, <b>a clear</b> day does <b>not literally</b> mean <b>a clear</b> day, <b>nor</b> does <b>a cloudy</b> day <b>literally</b> mean <b>a cloudy</b> day. <b>Rather, even</b> if the day is <b>cloudy but a north wind is blowing</b> the clouds away, <b>this is</b> considered <b>a clear</b> day.
<b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi: We teach this</b> matter of signs concerning crops <b>with regard to</b> the statement of <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi, as Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi says:</b> At <b>the conclusion of the final day of the festival</b> of <i>Sukkot</i>, <b>everyone looked upon the smoke</b> rising from <b>the arrangement</b> of wood on the altar. If the smoke <b>inclined toward</b> the <b>north</b> due to a south wind, <b>the poor</b> were <b>glad and the homeowners</b> were <b>sad, because</b> this was a sign that the <b>year’s rainfall</b> would be <b>plentiful, and</b> although the rain would produce an abundant crop, the <b>produce</b> would <b>decay</b> due to the humidity. The humidity would make it difficult to store the abundant harvest, forcing the homeowners to sell the produce quickly at a lower price.
If the smoke <b>inclined toward</b> the <b>south</b> due to a north wind, <b>the poor</b> were <b>sad and the homeowners</b> were <b>glad, because</b> this indicated that the <b>year’s rainfall</b> would be <b>sparse and</b> the <b>produce</b> would be meager and would <b>store</b> well. If the smoke <b>inclined toward</b> the <b>east</b> due to a west wind, <b>everyone</b> was <b>glad,</b> because this indicated that there would be sufficient rainfall to ensure a substantial crop, and at the same time, the produce would store well. If the smoke inclined <b>toward</b> the <b>west</b> due to an east wind, <b>everyone</b> was <b>sad,</b> because the east wind does not bring rain, and this indicated that there would be a drought.
The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: <b>An east</b> wind is <b>always beneficial,</b> and <b>a west</b> wind is <b>always harmful. A north wind</b> is <b>beneficial to the wheat when it has reached one-third</b> of its growth <b>and harmful to the olives when they are blossoming. And a south wind is harmful to the wheat when it has reached one-third</b> of its growth <b>and beneficial to the olives when they are blossoming.</b>
<b>And Rav Yosef says, and some say</b> it is <b>Mar Zutra</b> who says this, <b>and some say</b> it is <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak</b> who says this: The following is <b>your mnemonic</b> to remember which wind is beneficial to which crop: The <b>Table</b> is <b>in the north</b> of the Sanctuary, <b>and</b> the <b>Candelabrum</b> is <b>in the south. This</b> one <b>increases its own, and that</b> one <b>increases its own,</b> i.e., the Table, upon which the shewbread made from wheat is placed, is in the north, and the north wind is beneficial to the wheat. The Candelabrum, which is lit with olive oil, is in the south, and the south wind is beneficial to the olives. In any event, the <i>baraita</i> contradicts the statement of Rav Yitzḥak bar Avdimi with regard to the effect of the western and eastern winds.
The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This,</b> the east wind, is <b>for us,</b> in Babylonia, <b>and that,</b> the west wind, is <b>for them,</b> in Eretz Yisrael. In Babylonia the east wind is beneficial, because water is plentiful there, and the dry east wind does not harm the crops. In Eretz Yisrael the east wind is harmful, because water is scarce, and the east wind ruins the crops, whereas the west wind brings the necessary rain.
It <b>is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Abba Shaul says:</b> If <b>the festival of <i>Shavuot</i></b> is <b>a clear</b> day, this is <b>a good sign for the entire year. Rav Zevid said:</b> With regard to <b>this first day of Rosh HaShana, if</b> it is <b>warm, the entire year</b> will be <b>warm,</b> but <b>if</b> it is <b>cold, the entire year</b> will be <b>cold.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What difference is there</b> whether one knows this or not?

Daf 147b

The Gemara answers: The difference is <b>with regard to the prayer of the High Priest,</b> who would pray on Yom Kippur for beneficial weather, and this knowledge enabled him to formulate his prayers accordingly.
The Gemara resumes the discussion with regard to the gifts of a person on his deathbed: <b>And Rava</b> says that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> that the <b>gift of a person on his deathbed</b> does not require an act of acquisition <b>is merely by rabbinic law,</b> and it is instituted <b>lest</b> he see that his will is not being carried out and <b>he lose control of his mind</b> due to his grief, exacerbating his physical state.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rav Naḥman</b> actually <b>say this? But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say: Even though Shmuel says</b> that with regard to <b>one who sells a promissory note to another and then forgives</b> the debt, the debt <b>is forgiven</b> and the note is nullified, <b>and even</b> the <b>heir</b> of the creditor can <b>forgive</b> the debt, <b>Shmuel concedes that if</b> the creditor <b>gave</b> the promissory note <b>as the gift of a person on his deathbed,</b> his heir <b>cannot forgive</b> the debt?
<b>Granted, if you say</b> that the gift of a person on his deathbed is valid <b>by Torah law</b> without an act of acquisition, <b>due to that</b> reason the heir <b>cannot forgive</b> the debt, as the debt was acquired by another. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>it</b> is valid <b>by rabbinic law, why</b> is the heir <b>unable to forgive</b> the debt? The Gemara replies: Rav Naḥman maintains that although this gift <b>is not</b> effective <b>by Torah law,</b> nevertheless, the Sages <b>made it</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>with</b> the force <b>of Torah law.</b>
<b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who says: So-and-so shall reside in this house,</b> or who says: <b>So-and-so shall eat</b> the <b>fruit of this palm tree,</b> he <b>has not said anything,</b> as one cannot give that which is not tangible, such as the right to use property, or the right to consume fruit that has not yet grown. His statement is ineffective <b>until he says: Give this house to so-and-so and he shall reside there,</b> or: <b>Give this palm tree to so-and-so and he shall eat its fruit.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Is this to say that Rav Naḥman maintains</b> that only <b>a matter that can be</b> conferred as a gift <b>by a healthy person</b> with an act of acquisition <b>can be</b> conferred as a gift <b>by a person on his deathbed</b> by means of verbal instruction, but a matter <b>that cannot be</b> conferred as a gift <b>by a healthy person cannot be</b> conferred as a gift <b>by a person on his deathbed?</b> Consequently, a person on his deathbed cannot transfer ownership of an intangible right, just as a healthy person cannot do so. <b>But doesn’t Rava say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b>

Daf 148a

With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who says: Give</b> the <b>loan</b> owed <b>to me to so-and-so</b> as a gift, the <b>loan</b> owned to <b>him</b> is acquired <b>by so-and-so. And</b> this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>despite</b> the fact <b>that this does not</b> apply <b>in</b> the case of <b>a healthy person,</b> as one cannot transfer a loan to a third party without a promissory note. <b>Rav Pappa says:</b> In this case the <i>halakha</i> of transferring loans differs with regard to a person on his deathbed, <b>since an heir inherits</b> loans without a promissory note, and the Sages accorded the gift of a person on his deathbed the halakhic status of an inheritance.
<b>Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said: A loan</b> without a promissory note <b>can be</b> conferred as a gift <b>by a healthy person. And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> that which <b>Rav Huna</b> says that <b>Rav says, as Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to one who said to another: <b>I</b> have <b>one hundred dinars in your possession, give it to so-and-so,</b> if this was stated <b>in the presence of</b> all <b>three of the</b> parties, the third party <b>acquires</b> the money without an act of acquisition and without the need for witnesses.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to one who gave <b>a palm tree to one</b> person <b>and its fruit to another, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Did</b> he <b>reserve the place of the fruit</b> on the tree for the second person in order to give him a tangible object, and therefore the second person acquires the fruit, <b>or</b> did <b>he not reserve</b> it, and the second person does not acquire the fruit? Furthermore, <b>if you say</b> that giving the palm tree to one person and giving the fruit <b>to another is not</b> considered <b>reserving</b> the place of the fruit unless this is explicitly stipulated, then if he reserves the fruit <b>for himself,</b> stating that the tree is given to another <b>except for its fruit, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>?
<b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> Even <b>if you say</b> that giving the <b>palm tree to one</b> person <b>and its fruit to another is not</b> considered <b>reserving the place of the fruit</b> for the second person, if he gave the <b>palm tree to one</b> person <b>and reserved the fruit for himself,</b> he also <b>reserved the place of the fruit</b> for himself. <b>What is the reason</b> for this distinction? The reason is that <b>anything</b> that one reserves <b>with regard to himself, he reserves generously,</b> and therefore he reserves for himself not only the fruit itself, but also the place of the fruit.
<b>Rabbi Abba said to Rav Ashi: We learned</b> the aforementioned statement of Rav Naḥman <b>with regard to</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> concerning a different matter, <b>as Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> In the case of <b>one who sells a house to another and says to him:</b> I am selling the house <b>on the condition that the upper story [<i>deyota</i>]</b> remains <b>mine, the upper story</b> remains <b>his.</b>

Daf 148b

<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages with regard to the statement of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: If one sold <b>a house,</b> i.e., a lower story, <b>to one</b> person <b>and</b> stated that the upper <b>story</b> will be sold <b>to one</b> other person, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Is this</b> considered <b>reserving</b> additional rights for the second person apart from the upper story, <b>or not? If you say</b> that in a case where one sells his <b>house to one and</b> the upper <b>story to one,</b> his stipulation <b>is not</b> considered <b>reserving</b> rights for the second person, there is another dilemma. If one sold a house <b>except for</b> the upper <b>story,</b> reserving the upper story for himself, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is this considered reserving additional rights for himself?
<b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said:</b> Even <b>if you say</b> that where one sells the <b>house to one</b> person <b>and</b> the upper <b>story to one</b> other person, he <b>is not</b> considered to be <b>reserving</b> rights for the second person, if one sold a house <b>except for</b> the upper <b>story,</b> he <b>is</b> considered to be <b>reserving</b> additional rights for himself. <b>And</b> this is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav Zevid, who says</b> that the reason the seller reserves additional rights is <b>that if</b> he <b>wants to extend projections from</b> the upper story into the space of the courtyard, <b>he may extend</b> them.
The Gemara concludes: <b>Evidently, since he reserved</b> the upper <b>story, he also reserved the place of the projections. Here too,</b> with regard to the one who gave a palm tree to another and reserved the fruit for himself, <b>since he said</b> that the tree is given to another <b>except for its fruit, he reserved the place of the fruit</b> for himself as well.
§ The mishna (146b) states that if a person on his deathbed granted all of his property to others but reserved for himself any amount of land, his gift is valid even if he recovers. If he did not reserve for himself any amount of land, his gift is not valid if he recovers. <b>Rav Yosef bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> In the case of <b>a person on his deathbed who wrote</b> a deed granting <b>all of his property to others,</b> the manner in which he divided his property <b>is examined. If</b> it appears <b>that he was</b> intending <b>to divide</b> his entire estate among various recipients, then if <b>he dies, all</b> the recipients <b>acquire</b> their gifts. If he <b>recovers,</b> he can <b>retract all</b> of the gifts, in accordance with the ruling of the mishna.
But <b>if</b> it appears <b>that he was reconsidering</b> the matter, initially intending to give away only a portion of his property, and then reconsidering and distributing the rest, then if <b>he dies, all</b> of the recipients <b>acquire</b> their gifts. If <b>he recovers, he can retract only the last</b> gift, as the previous gifts were given with the intent to reserve part of the property for himself, and they are valid even if he recovers. The Gemara asks: <b>Perhaps</b> he was not reconsidering; rather, he initially intended to transfer ownership of all of his property, and <b>he was considering</b> to whom to give each portion <b>and then giving</b> it. The Gemara answers: <b>The usual</b> way <b>of a person on his deathbed is to consider</b> the matter <b>carefully</b> first <b>and</b> only <b>then</b> to <b>confer</b> his gifts. Therefore, if he pauses to consider in the interim, it appears that he did not initially intend to transfer ownership of his entire estate.
§ <b>Rav Aḥa bar Minyumi says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who wrote</b> a deed granting <b>all of his</b> generally known <b>property to others, and</b> he then <b>recovered, he cannot retract</b> it, as <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps he has property in another province</b> that he reserved for himself, in which case the gift is valid even if he recovered.
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> as for <b>the mishna, which teaches:</b> If <b>he did not reserve</b> for himself <b>any amount of land,</b> and he recovered, <b>his gift is not valid, how can you find these</b> circumstances? <b>Rav Ḥama said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where he says: All my property</b> is given to so-and-so, in which case he clearly reserved nothing for himself. <b>Mar bar Rav Ashi said:</b> The mishna is referring to a case <b>where our presumption is that he does not have</b> property elsewhere.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed, <b>is a partial retraction</b> of the gift considered <b>a retraction of the entire</b> gift, <b>or</b> it is <b>not</b> considered a retraction of the entire gift? The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a <i>baraita</i>: If one gave <b>all</b> of his property <b>to the first</b> recipient <b>and</b> then he partially retracted his gift and gave <b>part</b> of his property <b>to the second</b> recipient, <b>the second acquired</b> his gift, but <b>the first did not acquire</b> anything. <b>What, is it not</b> referring to a case <b>where</b> the giver <b>died,</b> and the reason that the first recipient does not acquire anything is that a partial retraction is considered a retraction of the entire gift?
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>No,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the giver <b>recovered.</b> The first gift was invalidated, because he left nothing for himself, whereas the second gift remained valid, since he gave only part of his property. Had he died, the first recipient would have received the remainder, as the giver retracted only part of the first gift, which he gave to the second recipient.
The Gemara comments: <b>So too, it is reasonable</b> to understand the <i>baraita</i> in this manner. <b>From</b> the fact <b>that the last clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches:</b> If he gave <b>part</b> of his property <b>to the first</b> recipient, <b>and</b> then he gave <b>all</b> of his property <b>to the second</b> recipient, <b>the first</b> recipient <b>acquired</b> his gift, but <b>the second did not acquire</b> anything. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where</b> the giver <b>recovered, due to that</b> reason <b>the second</b> recipient <b>did not acquire</b> the gift. <b>But if you say</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where he died, both of them should acquire</b> their gifts.
<b>Rav Yeimar said to Rav Ashi: And even</b> if the first clause of the <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> referring <b>to</b> a case <b>where he recovered,</b> one can prove that a partial retraction is considered a retraction of the entire gift. <b>Granted, if you say</b> that <b>a partial retraction is</b> considered <b>a retraction of the entire</b> gift, <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that at least the second</b> recipient <b>acquired</b> the gift, as the giver reserved part of his property for himself. <b>But if you say</b> that <b>a partial retraction is not</b> considered <b>a retraction of the entire</b> gift, the giver <b>should be</b> considered <b>as one who was dividing</b> all of his property between the two recipients, <b>and neither of them should acquire</b> their gifts.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a partial retraction is</b> considered <b>a retraction of the entire</b> gift. <b>You find</b> the <i>halakha</i> that is stated in <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i> <b>both</b> in a case <b>where</b> the giver <b>died and</b> in a case <b>where he recovered. You find</b> the <i>halakha</i> that is stated in <b>the last clause only</b> in a case <b>where he recovered.</b>
§ A series of <b>dilemmas were raised before</b> the Sages: If a person on his deathbed <b>consecrated all of his property</b> to the Temple treasury <b>and</b> subsequently <b>recovered, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that in <b>any</b> case <b>that concerns consecrated</b> property the assumption is that he <b>resolves to transfer</b> the property unconditionally, and therefore the consecration is valid even if he recovers? <b>Or perhaps</b> in <b>any</b> matter <b>that concerns himself</b> he <b>does not resolve to transfer</b> the property unconditionally.
Furthermore, if a person on his deathbed <b>declared all of his property ownerless, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that <b>since</b> declaring his property ownerless is <b>for</b> the benefit of <b>the poor as well as the rich,</b> it involves the potential mitzva of providing for the poor, and therefore the assumption is that <b>he resolves to transfer</b> the property, i.e., declare it ownerless, unconditionally? <b>Or perhaps</b> in <b>any</b> matter <b>that concerns himself he does not resolve to transfer</b> the property unconditionally.
Furthermore, if a person on his deathbed <b>divided all of his property to</b> be distributed to <b>the poor, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Do we say</b> that with regard to <b>charity</b> the assumption is that <b>he certainly resolves to transfer</b> the property unconditionally? <b>Or perhaps</b> in <b>any</b> matter <b>that concerns himself he does not resolve to transfer</b> the property unconditionally. The Gemara concludes: These dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
The Gemara presents <b>another version</b> of this series of dilemmas: If a person on his deathbed <b>consecrated all of his property</b> to the Temple treasury, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he <b>declared all of his property ownerless, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he <b>divided all</b> of <b>his property to</b> be distributed to <b>the poor, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? These dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>Rav Sheshet says:</b> If one says: So-and-so <b>shall take</b> my property, <b>or:</b> So-and-so <b>shall gain possession</b> of my property, <b>or:</b> So-and-so <b>shall take possession</b> of my property, <b>or: He shall acquire</b> my property, <b>all of</b> these <b>are terms</b> that denote the bestowal <b>of gifts.</b> It <b>was taught in a <i>baraita</i>:</b> If one says: So-and-so <b>shall receive as an inheritance, or:</b> So-and-so <b>shall inherit,</b> these are <b>also</b> valid terms denoting inheritance <b>in</b> the case of <b>one who is fit to inherit</b> from <b>him. And this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan ben Beroka,</b> who holds that one can bequeath all of his property to one of his sons using terms that denote inheritance, not only using terms that denote the bestowal of a gift.
A series of <b>dilemmas were raised before</b> the Sages:

Daf 149a

If a person on his deathbed says: So-and-so <b>shall benefit from</b> my property, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is he <b>saying that all</b> of the property <b>shall be a gift? Or perhaps</b> he is <b>saying</b> that the recipient <b>shall derive some benefit from</b> the property. If he says: So-and-so <b>shall be seen in</b> my property, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he says: So-and-so <b>shall stand in</b> my property, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? If he says: So-and-so <b>shall rely on</b> my property, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara concludes: All these dilemmas <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If a person on his deathbed <b>sold all of his property, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says: If he recovers, he cannot retract</b> the sale. <b>And</b> at <b>times, Rav Yehuda said</b> that <b>Rav said: If he recovers, he can retract</b> the sale. <b>And</b> these statements <b>do not disagree. This</b> statement, that he can retract the sale, applies in a case <b>where the dinars</b> he received as payment <b>are</b> still <b>extant,</b> i.e., in his possession. <b>That</b> statement, that he cannot retract the sale, applies in a case <b>where he paid his debt with</b> those dinars.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: In the case of <b>a person on his deathbed who admitted</b> that he owed money to a certain person, where it was possible that he did not actually owe him money, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Does his admission qualify as the gift of a person on his deathbed? The Gemara answers: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof, <b>as Issur the convert had twelve thousand dinars</b> deposited in <b>the house of Rava. Rav Mari,</b> Issur’s <b>son, whose conception was not in</b> the <b>sanctity</b> of the Jewish people, i.e., he was conceived before his father converted, <b>but his birth was in</b> the <b>sanctity</b> of the Jewish people, i.e., he was born after his father converted, <b>was</b> in <b>a study hall</b> elsewhere when his father was on his deathbed.
<b>Rava</b> reasoned that he would acquire possession of the deposit for himself, as he <b>said: How can Rav Mari acquire these dinars? If</b> he attempts to acquire the money <b>as inheritance, he is not fit to inherit</b> from Issur. Since he was conceived before his father converted, he is therefore not halakhically considered his son. <b>If</b> he attempts to acquire it <b>as a gift, the Sages equated</b> the halakhic status of the <b>gift of a person on his deathbed with</b> that of <b>inheritance.</b> Therefore, <b>anywhere that</b> the property <b>can be</b> acquired <b>as inheritance, it can</b> also <b>be</b> acquired <b>as a gift,</b> and <b>anywhere that</b> the property <b>cannot be</b> acquired <b>as inheritance, it cannot be</b> acquired <b>as a gift.</b>
<b>If</b> he attempts to acquire the dinars <b>by pulling</b> them, which is a formal act of acquisition, he will not be able to do this, as the dinars <b>are not with him. If</b> he attempts to acquire them <b>by</b> means of symbolic <b>exchange,</b> a pro forma act of acquisition effecting the transfer of ownership of an article, <b>money cannot be acquired by</b> means of symbolic <b>exchange. If</b> he attempts to acquire them <b>by means of</b> the acquisition of <b>land,</b> Issur <b>does not have</b> any <b>land. If</b> he attempts to acquire them by means of verbal instruction made by his father <b>in the presence of</b> all <b>three</b> parties, i.e., the giver, the recipient, and the bailee, <b>if he sends for me,</b> the bailee, <b>I shall not go,</b> as without the presence of the bailee he cannot transfer ownership of the money.
<b>Rav Ika, son of Rav Ami, objected to this: Why</b> is Rav Mari unable to acquire the money? <b>But</b> why not <b>let Issur admit that these dinars are</b> owned <b>by Rav Mari, and he shall transfer</b> ownership of <b>them</b> to Rav Mari <b>by</b> means of a document of <b>admission? In the meantime,</b> a document of <b>admission</b> stating that the dinars belonged to Rav Mari <b>emerged from Issur’s house. Rava became angry,</b> and <b>said: They are teaching people</b> legal <b>claims and causing me loss.</b> In any event, this incident proves that the admission of a person on his deathbed is a valid means of transferring ownership.

Daf 149b

§ The mishna teaches (146b): If a person on his deathbed <b>reserved</b> for himself <b>any amount of land, his gift stands</b> even if he subsequently recovers. The Gemara asks: <b>And how much</b> is meant by the term: <b>Any amount? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> This means <b>land</b> that is <b>sufficient</b> to provide <b>for his livelihood.</b> Since he reserved this land for himself, one can assume that he wished to transfer the rest of his property in any event. <b>And Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says:</b> Even if he reserved for himself <b>movable property</b> that is <b>sufficient</b> to provide <b>for his livelihood,</b> his gift is valid.
<b>Rabbi Zeira said: How meticulous</b> are <b>the halakhic statements of the elders</b> Rav Yehuda and Rav Yirmeya. With regard to <b>land, what</b> is <b>the reason</b> that he must have reserved enough for his livelihood? The reason is <b>that if he recovers</b> he will <b>rely on that</b> land for his livelihood. With regard to <b>movable property as well, if he recovers</b> he will <b>rely on it</b> for his livelihood.
<b>Rav Yosef objects to</b> Rabbi Zeira’s statement: <b>What is meticulous</b> about these statements? The statement of the <b>one who says</b> the gift is valid even if he reserved for himself <b>movable property</b> is difficult, as <b>we learn</b> in the mishna that he must leave himself <b>land.</b> The statement of the <b>one who says</b> that he must leave himself an amount <b>sufficient</b> to provide <b>for his livelihood</b> is difficult, as <b>we learn</b> in the mishna that his gift is valid if he reserved for himself <b>any amount.</b>
<b>Abaye said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>And anywhere that</b> the term <b>land is taught,</b> does it mean <b>specifically land? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:8): With regard to <b>one who writes,</b> i.e., gives via a document, <b>all of his property to his</b> Canaanite <b>slave,</b> the slave <b>has been emancipated,</b> but if he <b>reserved</b> for himself <b>any amount of land,</b> then he <b>has not been emancipated,</b> as perhaps he reserved the slave for himself as well. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: He always</b> becomes <b>a freeman</b> regardless of the wording of the document, even if the owner reserved land for himself, <b>unless it says</b> in the document: <b>All of my property is given to so-and-so my slave, except for one ten-thousandth of it,</b> as in that case it is possible that the master meant to include the slave in the portion that he is not giving away. Consequently, the slave is not emancipated.

Daf 150a

<b>And Rav Dimi bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The Sages <b>deemed movable property</b> to be considered a significant <b>reserving</b> of property for oneself <b>with regard to</b> the emancipation of <b>a slave,</b> so that a slave is not emancipated when his owner gives him all of his other property. <b>But they did not deem movable property</b> that one withheld from his sons and earmarked for his wife to be considered a significant <b>reserving</b> of property <b>with regard to</b> her <b>marriage contract.</b> If one granted all of his property to his sons but reserved any amount of land for his wife, she forfeits her marriage contract. By not protesting the gift, she has conceded that she will collect her marriage contract only from the land he reserved for her. Nevertheless, if he reserved only movable property for his wife, she does not forfeit her marriage contract. Rabbi Elazar’s ruling with regard to a slave indicates that the expression: Reserves any amount of land, does not necessarily exclude movable property.
Rav Yosef replies: <b>There,</b> with regard to the slave, <b>by right</b> the mishna <b>should not</b> have <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>land,</b> but it should have taught the <i>halakha</i> with regard to all property. <b>But since</b> the <b>former clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> a <i>halakha</i> with regard to land, the mishna mentions land in the subsequent clause as well. The Gemara cites the former clause (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:6): <b>Rabbi Akiva says:</b> The owner of <b>any amount of land is obligated in <i>pe’a</i> and in first fruits; and</b> if the debtor possesses any amount of land the creditor <b>can write a document that prevents the Sabbatical Year from abrogating an outstanding debt [<i>prosbol</i>] for it</b> so that his loans will not be canceled in the seventh year; <b>and</b> he <b>can acquire property that does not serve as a guarantee</b> along <b>with it by</b> means of <b>money, by a deed, or by taking possession</b> of it. Rav Yosef concludes: <b>Due to this</b> reason, the mishna <b>teaches</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>land.</b>
Abaye raises an objection to Rav Yosef’s statement that the term any amount should be understood literally: <b>And anywhere that</b> the term: <b>Any amount, is taught,</b> does the amount <b>not have a measure? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Ḥullin</i> 135a): <b>Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas says:</b> When shearing <b>five sheep,</b> the <b>sheared</b> wool of each sheep, with the wool weighing <b>one hundred dinars and half</b> of <b>one hundred dinars,</b> i.e., one hundred and fifty dinars, renders the owner <b>obligated in</b> the mitzva to give <b>the first sheared</b> wool to the priests. <b>And the Rabbis say: Five sheep,</b> each of whose <b>sheared</b> wool yields wool weighing <b>any amount. And we say: And how much</b> is signified by the term: <b>Any amount? Rav says:</b> A total weight of <b>one hundred dinars and half</b> of one hundred dinars, <b>provided that</b> the one hundred and fifty dinars <b>are divided</b> equally <b>between the five</b> sheep. This indicates that the term any amount can denote a certain minimal amount.
Rav Yosef replies: <b>There,</b> with regard to the first sheared wool, <b>by right</b> the mishna <b>should not</b> have <b>taught</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to <b>any amount. But since the first <i>tanna</i>,</b> Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas, <b>states a large measure,</b> the Rabbis <b>also state</b> that they require <b>a small measure,</b> and therefore they <b>call</b> this measure <b>any amount.</b> But with regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed, the term any amount should be understood literally.
§ It is <b>obvious</b> that if one <b>said:</b> I give <b>my movable property to so-and-so,</b> then that person <b>acquires all</b> of <b>his utensils, excluding</b> his <b>wheat and barley.</b> If one said: I give <b>all my movable property to so-and-so,</b> then that person acquires <b>even</b> the <b>wheat and barley, and he acquires even the upper millstone,</b> since it is occasionally removed from its place. He acquires all the property that is not land or houses, <b>except for the lower millstone,</b> which is never moved. If he said: I give <b>everything that can be moved</b> to so-and-so, that person <b>acquires even the lower millstone,</b> as it is possible to move it.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: Is the legal status of a Canaanite <b>slave like</b> that of <b>land, or</b> is his status <b>like</b> that of <b>movable property? Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (68a): A landowner <b>who sells the city has sold</b> with it the <b>houses,</b> and the <b>ditches and caves, and</b> the <b>bathhouses,</b> and <b>the olive presses and the irrigated fields, but not the movable property. But when</b> the seller <b>said</b> to the buyer: I am selling <b>it and everything that is in it,</b> then <b>even</b> if <b>there were animals or</b> Canaanite <b>slaves in</b> the city, <b>they are all sold.</b> Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Avya, explains the proof: <b>Granted, if you say</b> that the legal status of a Canaanite slave <b>is like</b> that of <b>movable property, due to that</b> reason <b>he is not sold in the first</b> case. <b>But if you say</b> that the legal status of a Canaanite slave <b>is like</b> that of <b>land, why is he not sold</b> with the city?
Rav Ashi replied: <b>Rather, what</b> do you say? Do you maintain that his legal status <b>is like</b> that of <b>movable property?</b> If there is no difference in legal status between Canaanite slaves and movable property, <b>what</b> is the reason that the mishna emphasizes in the second case that <b>even</b> the Canaanite slaves are sold? <b>Rather, what have you to say</b> to explain this? One must explain that <b>movable property that moves</b> by itself <b>is different from movable property that does not move</b> by itself, and therefore one might have thought that although the sale includes movable property, Canaanite slaves are not included in the sale. In the same manner, <b>even</b> if <b>you say</b> that the legal status of a Canaanite slave <b>is like</b> that of <b>land, land that moves is different from land that does not move.</b> Therefore, the legal status of Canaanite slaves cannot be proved from this mishna.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:8): With regard to <b>one who writes,</b> i.e., gives via a document, <b>all of his property to his</b> Canaanite <b>slave,</b> the slave <b>has been emancipated,</b> but if he <b>reserved</b> for himself <b>any amount of land,</b> then he <b>has not been emancipated,</b> as perhaps he reserved the slave for himself as well. <b>Rabbi Shimon says: He always</b> becomes <b>a freeman</b> regardless of the wording of the document, even if the owner reserved land for himself, <b>unless it says</b> in the document: <b>All of my property is given to so-and-so my slave, except for one ten-thousandth of it.</b>
<b>And Rav Dimi bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> The Sages <b>deemed movable property</b> to be considered a significant <b>reserving</b> of property for oneself <b>with regard to a slave,</b> so that the slave is not emancipated when the owner gives him all of his other property. <b>But they did not deem movable property</b> that one withheld from his sons and earmarked for his wife to be considered a significant <b>reserving</b> of property <b>with regard to</b> her <b>marriage contract. And Rava said to Rav Naḥman: What is the reason</b> for this? Rav Naḥman explained: A Canaanite <b>slave is</b> considered <b>movable property, and</b> reserving <b>movable property is</b> considered a significant <b>reserving with regard to movable property. But a woman’s marriage contract is</b> a document concerning <b>land,</b> since the payment of the marriage contract is collected from land, <b>and</b> reserving <b>movable property is not</b> considered a significant <b>reserving with regard to land.</b> Rav Naḥman states that a Canaanite slave is considered movable property.

Daf 150b

Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Ravina: The reason the slave is not emancipated if the master reserved part of the property for himself is not that the slave is included in the property that the owner reserved for himself. Rather, <b>we teach this</b> <i>halakha</i> as being <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the document is <b>not a bill</b> of manumission <b>that</b> completely <b>severs</b> the bond between the slave and the master.
§ <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> There are <b>five</b> types of gifts to which specific <i>halakhot</i> apply, but the <i>halakhot</i> do not apply <b>until</b> the owners <b>write</b> a deed granting <b>all</b> of <b>their property</b> to another without reserving anything for themselves, <b>and they are as follows:</b> The gift of <b>a person on his deathbed,</b> a gift to one’s Canaanite <b>slave,</b> a gift to one’s <b>wife,</b> a gift to one’s <b>sons,</b> and the gift of <b>a woman who shelters</b> her property from her prospective husband by transferring her property to another before her marriage. In this latter case the Sages instituted that if her husband dies or divorces her she can reclaim the property.
The Gemara explains each of these cases: In the case of a gift of <b>a person on his deathbed,</b> this is <b>as we learned</b> in the mishna (146b): With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who wrote</b> a deed granting <b>all of his property to others, and he reserved</b> for himself <b>any amount of land, his gift stands</b> even if he subsequently recovers. If <b>he did not reserve</b> for himself <b>any amount of land,</b> and he recovered, <b>his gift does not stand,</b> as the gift was conditional upon his death, since evidently he did not intend to leave himself without means of support if he survived.
In the case of a gift to one’s <b>slave,</b> this is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:8): With regard to <b>one who writes</b> a deed granting <b>all of his property to his</b> Canaanite <b>slave,</b> the slave <b>has been emancipated,</b> but if he <b>reserved</b> for himself <b>any amount of land,</b> then he <b>has not been emancipated,</b> as perhaps he reserved the slave for himself as well.
In the case of a gift to one’s <b>wife,</b> this is <b>as Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: One who writes</b> a deed granting <b>all of his property to his wife renders her only a steward</b> of his property, i.e., he intends only to place her in charge of the property and she does not acquire it. According to Rav Naḥman, this applies only if he did not reserve any part of the property for himself.
In the case of a gift to one’s <b>sons,</b> this is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:7): With regard to <b>one who writes</b> a deed granting <b>all of his property to his sons, and he writes</b> in the deed that he grants <b>any amount of land to his wife, she forfeits</b> payment of <b>her marriage contract.</b> If he reserves any amount of land for himself, his wife does not forfeit payment of her marriage contract.
In the case of a gift of <b>a woman who shelters</b> her property from her intended husband, this is <b>as the Master says:</b> In the case of <b>a woman who</b> wishes to <b>shelter</b> her property from her prospective husband, <b>she must write</b> a deed granting <b>all</b> of <b>her property</b> to another. If she reserves for herself any amount of property, she cannot reclaim the property if she is widowed or divorced.
The Gemara concludes: <b>With regard to all of these</b> cases, reserving <b>movable property is</b> considered a significant <b>reserving</b> of property, <b>except with regard to</b> a woman’s <b>marriage contract.</b> If one grants all of his property to his sons except for any amount of land, which he gives to his wife, and he reserves for himself only movable property, his wife forfeits payment of her marriage contract, as nothing remains in the husband’s possession from which she is entitled to collect payment. This is <b>because the Sages instituted</b> that the lien on the marriage contract is placed <b>on land,</b> and <b>the Sages did not institute</b> that the marriage contract can be collected <b>from movable property.</b>
<b>Ameimar said:</b> With regard to <b>movable property that is</b> explicitly <b>written in the marriage contract</b> as property from which the debt may be collected <b>and is</b> still <b>extant,</b> if the husband reserves this property for himself, this <b>is</b> considered a significant <b>reserving</b> of property, and his wife does not forfeit payment of her marriage contract.
§ If one <b>said: My property</b> shall go <b>to so-and-so,</b> anything that is referred to as property is included in the gift. A Canaanite <b>slave is called property, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Pe’a</i> 3:8): With regard to <b>one who writes,</b> i.e., gives via a document, <b>all of his property to his</b> Canaanite <b>slave,</b> the slave <b>has been emancipated. Land is called property, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 26a): <b>Property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land, <b>can be acquired by</b> means of <b>money, by</b> means of <b>a deed, or by taking possession</b> of it. <b>A cloak,</b> as well as other garments and movable property, <b>is called property, as we learned</b> in that same mishna: <b>And</b> property <b>that does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, <b>can be acquired only by pulling.</b>
<b>Money [<i>zuzei</i>] is called property, as we learned</b> in that same mishna: <b>And</b> property <b>that does not serve as a guarantee can be acquired</b> together <b>with property that serves as a guarantee by</b> means of <b>money, by</b> means of <b>a deed, or by taking possession</b> of it. Money is among the types of property that can be acquired by means of the acquisition of land, <b>as</b> is evident from <b>this</b> incident <b>involving Rav Pappa,</b> who <b>had twelve thousand dinars</b> loaned to the people of <b>Bei Ḥozai.</b> Rav Pappa <b>transferred</b> ownership of the money <b>to Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa,</b> who was traveling to Bei Ḥozai, <b>by means of</b> transferring ownership of <b>the threshold of his house,</b> so that Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa could collect the money. <b>When</b> Rav Shmuel bar Aḥa <b>came</b> back with the money, Rav Pappa was so pleased that he <b>went out as far as Tavakh to meet him.</b>
<b>A deed is called property, as Rabba bar Yitzḥak says: There are two</b> types of <b>deeds</b> with regard to the acquisition of land. If one <b>said</b> to the witnesses: <b>Acquire this field on behalf of so-and-so and write the deed for him</b> as proof of the sale, the giver <b>can retract the deed but he cannot retract the</b> transfer of ownership of the <b>field</b> once the other party has taken possession of it. If one said: Acquire this field on behalf of so-and-so <b>on the condition that you write the deed for him,</b> the giver <b>can retract both the deed and</b> the transfer of <b>the field,</b> as he stipulated that the acquisition of the field is dependent on the writing of the deed.
<b>And Rav Ḥiyya bar Avin</b> says that <b>Rav Huna says: There are three</b> types of <b>deeds. Two</b> are <b>those that we stated</b> above, and <b>the other</b> is as follows: <b>If the seller wrote the deed in advance</b> and kept it until the buyer would come and pay him. The Gemara adds parenthetically: This is <b>like that</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>that we learned</b> in a mishna (167b):

Daf 151a

A scribe may <b>write a deed</b> of sale <b>for the seller</b> of property at the seller’s request, <b>even if the buyer is not with him</b> when he presents his request, as the deed obligates only the seller. In this case, <b>once this</b> one, the buyer, <b>has taken possession of the land, the deed is acquired, wherever it is. And this is</b> as it is stated in the mishna <b>that we learned</b> (<i>Kiddushin</i> 26a): <b>Property that does not serve as a guarantee can be acquired</b> together <b>with the property that serves as a guarantee by</b> means of <b>money, by</b> means of <b>a deed, or by taking possession</b> of it. One can learn from this that a deed is included in the term: Property that does not serve as a guarantee.
<b>An animal is called property, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 12a): In a case of <b>one who consecrated his property, and on</b> the property <b>there were animals fit to</b> be sacrificed <b>upon</b> the <b>altar, male</b> animals are sacrificed as <b>burnt-offerings, and female</b> animals <b>are sold for the purpose of</b> being sacrificed as <b>peace-offerings. Birds are called property, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Shekalim</i> 12a): In a case of <b>one who consecrated his property, and on</b> the property <b>there were items that were fit to</b> be sacrificed <b>upon</b> the <b>altar,</b> e.g., <b>wines, oils, and birds,</b> Rabbi Eliezer says: They are sold for the needs of that kind of item, i.e., to individuals who will use them as such.
<b>Phylacteries are called property, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Arakhin</i> 23b): With regard to <b>one who consecrates his property,</b> the value of his <b>phylacteries is assessed for him</b> and he redeems them by paying their value to the Temple treasury. <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to <b>a Torah scroll, what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Is it considered property or not? Does one say that <b>since it is not sold, as it is prohibited to sell</b> a Torah scroll, <b>it is</b> therefore <b>not</b> considered <b>property? Or perhaps</b> one says that <b>since it may be sold</b> in order to enable one <b>to study Torah or to marry a woman, it is</b> considered <b>property.</b> The Gemara concludes: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The Gemara presents <b>a mnemonic</b> for the series of incidents stated below: <b>Zutra, the mother, of Amram, from two sisters, Rav Tovi, and Rav Dimi and Rav Yosef.</b>
<b>The mother of Rav Zutra bar Toviyya wrote</b> a deed granting <b>her property to Rav Zutra bar Toviyya,</b> explaining that she was doing so <b>because she wanted to get married to Rav Zevid,</b> and she did not want him to acquire her property. <b>She married</b> Rav Zevid, <b>and he divorced her. She came before Rav Beivai bar Abaye</b> to claim her property from her son. Rav Beivai <b>said:</b> She transferred her property <b>because</b> she wanted <b>to get married, and she married.</b> Since her intentions were fulfilled, even though she subsequently was divorced, the gift is a valid gift.
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said to</b> Rav Beivai: Is it <b>because you come from</b> a line of <b>truncated [<i>mula’ei</i>] people,</b> from the house of the High Priest Eli, whose descendants were condemned to premature death (see I Samuel 2:31), that <b>you say truncated [<i>mulyata</i>]</b> and unsound <b>matters? Even according to the one who says</b> that the deed of <b>a woman who shelters</b> her property from her intended husband <b>effects acquisition,</b> and the woman cannot reclaim the property, <b>this matter</b> applies <b>where she did not reveal her intentions</b> in transferring ownership of her property. <b>But here, she revealed her intentions that</b> she transferred the property <b>because</b> she wanted <b>to marry; and she married, but was divorced.</b> Therefore, since she is no longer married, she can reclaim the property.
<b>The mother of Rami bar Ḥama wrote</b> a deed <b>in the evening</b> granting <b>her property to Rami bar Ḥama. In the morning</b> of the following day, <b>she wrote</b> a deed granting her property <b>to</b> his brother, <b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama. Rami bar Ḥama came before Rav Sheshet,</b> who <b>established him</b> as the owner <b>of the property,</b> as the deed transferring the property to him preceded the gift to his brother. <b>Rav Ukva bar Ḥama came before Rav Naḥman,</b> who <b>established him</b> as the owner <b>of the property.</b>
<b>Rav Sheshet came before Rav Naḥman</b> and <b>said to him: What is the reason</b> that the <b>Master established Rav Ukva bar Ḥama</b> as the owner of the property? <b>If</b> it is <b>because she retracted</b> her gift, <b>but didn’t she die?</b> Since the gift of a person on his deathbed is considered valid, Rami bar Ḥama already acquired the property in the evening. Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Sheshet: <b>This</b> is what <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed, in <b>any</b> case <b>where he could retract</b> his gift <b>if he were to recover,</b> i.e., if he transferred ownership of all of his property, even if he does not recover, <b>he can retract his gift.</b>
Rav Sheshet responded: <b>Say that Shmuel said</b> that he can retract his gift if he wants to retain the property <b>for himself,</b> but if he wants to retract his gift in order to give it <b>to another, did he</b> also <b>say</b> that he can do so? Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Sheshet: <b>Shmuel explicitly said</b> that he can retract his gift <b>both</b> in order to retain the property <b>for himself and</b> to grant it <b>to another.</b>
<b>The mother of Rav Amram the Pious had a bundle [<i>meloga</i>] of</b> promissory <b>notes. When she was dying, she said: Let</b> these promissory notes <b>be for Amram, my son. His brothers came before Rav Naḥman. They said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>But</b> Rav Amram <b>did not pull</b> the bundle of documents, and since an act of acquisition was not performed he did not acquire them. Rav Naḥman <b>said to them:</b> An act of acquisition was not required, because <b>the statement of a person on his deathbed is considered as written and as</b> though the documents were <b>delivered</b> to the recipient.
<b>The sister of Rav Tovi bar Rav Mattana wrote</b> a deed <b>in the morning</b> granting <b>her property to Rav Tovi bar Rav Mattana. In the evening</b> another brother, <b>Rav Aḥadvoi bar Rav Mattana, came</b> and <b>cried to her.</b> Rav Aḥadvoi <b>said to her: Now</b> people <b>will say</b> that you gave your property to Rav Tovi because this <b>Master,</b> Rav Tovi, is <b>a Torah scholar, and</b> that <b>Master,</b> Rav Aḥadvoi, <b>is not a Torah scholar. She wrote</b> a deed granting the property <b>to him.</b> Rav Tovi <b>came before Rav Naḥman.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rav Tovi: <b>This</b> is what <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed, in <b>any</b> case <b>where he could retract</b> his gift <b>if he were to recover,</b> even if he does not recover, <b>he can retract his gift,</b> and therefore the property belongs to Rav Aḥadvoi.
<b>The sister of Rav Dimi bar Yosef had a tract of</b> land in <b>an orchard. Whenever she was sick</b> and thought that she was dying, <b>she would transfer</b> ownership of the orchard <b>to</b> Rav Dimi,

Daf 151b

<b>and when she recovered she would retract</b> her gift. On <b>one occasion she was sick. She sent</b> a message <b>to</b> Rav Dimi: <b>Come</b> and <b>acquire</b> my property. <b>He sent</b> a message back to her: <b>I do not want</b> to come. <b>She sent</b> a message <b>to him: Come</b> and <b>acquire</b> my property in <b>any manner that you want. He went and reserved</b> for her part of the orchard, <b>and</b> he <b>acquired</b> the rest of the property <b>from her</b> with an act of acquisition. <b>When she recovered she retracted</b> the gift.
<b>She came before Rav Naḥman</b> to reclaim it. Rav Naḥman <b>sent</b> a message <b>to</b> Rav Dimi: <b>Come</b> to court. Rav Dimi <b>did not come. He said: What</b> reason is there for <b>me to come? Didn’t</b> I <b>reserve</b> part of the property for her, <b>and</b> I <b>acquired</b> the rest of the property <b>from her</b> with an act of acquisition? Therefore, the acquisition is complete. Rav Naḥman <b>sent</b> a message <b>to</b> Rav Dimi: <b>If you do not come, I will strike you with a thorn [<i>besileva</i>] that does not draw blood,</b> i.e., I will excommunicate you.
Inquiring into the matter, Rav Naḥman <b>said to the witnesses: How did the act</b> of transferring the property take place? The witnesses <b>said to</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>This</b> is what <b>she said: Woe, that woman is dying!</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said to them: If so, this is</b> a case of <b>one who issues directives</b> with regard to his property <b>due to</b> his expectation of his imminent <b>death. And one who issues directives due to</b> his expectation of his imminent <b>death can retract</b> his gift even if he did not transfer all of his property, as he evidently granted the gift only because he expected to die.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to <b>a gift of a person on his deathbed</b> that includes only <b>a part</b> of his property. <b>The Sages said</b> the following <b>before Rava in the name of Mar Zutra, son of Rav Naḥman, who said</b> it <b>in the name of Rav Naḥman: This</b> type of gift <b>is</b> in some respects <b>like the gift of a healthy person, and</b> in other respects <b>it is like</b> the <b>gift of a person on his deathbed. It is like the gift of a healthy person, as, if he recovers he cannot retract</b> it, as stated in the mishna. <b>And it is like</b> the <b>gift of a person on his deathbed, as it does not require</b> an act of <b>acquisition.</b> Rather, it is acquired by means of verbal instruction alone.
<b>Rava said to</b> the Sages: <b>Did I not say to you: Do not hang empty pitchers [<i>bukei</i>] upon Rav Naḥman,</b> i.e., do not attribute incorrect statements to him? <b>This is</b> what <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> A gift of a person on his deathbed that includes only a part of his property <b>is like the gift of a healthy person and requires</b> an act of <b>acquisition.</b> If an act of acquisition is not performed, the acquisition of the gift is not effective even if the owner dies.
<b>Rava raised an objection to Rav Naḥman</b> from the mishna (146b): If <b>he reserved</b> for himself <b>any amount of land, his gift stands. What, is it not</b> referring even to a case <b>where</b> the gift <b>was not acquired from him</b> by means of an act of acquisition? <b>No,</b> it is referring to a case <b>where</b> the gift <b>was acquired from him</b> by means of an act of acquisition. Rava asks: <b>If that is so, say the last clause</b> of the mishna: If <b>he did not reserve</b> for himself <b>any amount of land,</b> and he recovered, <b>his gift does not stand. And if</b> the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the gift <b>was acquired from him</b> by means of an act of acquisition, <b>why does his gift not stand?</b>
Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> Rava: <b>This is</b> what <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who wrote</b> a deed granting <b>all of his property to others</b> without reserving anything for himself, <b>even though</b> the gift <b>was acquired from his possession</b> by means of an act of acquisition, if <b>he recovers, he can retract</b> his gift. The reason for this is that <b>it is known that he was issuing directives</b> with regard to his property <b>only due to</b> his expectation of his imminent <b>death.</b>
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya raised an objection to Rava:</b> There was <b>an incident involving the mother of the sons of Rokhel, who was sick, and she said: My brooch [<i>keveinati</i>] shall be given to my daughter, and it is</b> valued <b>at twelve hundred dinars. And</b> this woman subsequently <b>died, and</b> the Sages <b>upheld her statement</b> even though the gift included only a part of her property and an act of acquisition was not performed. Rava replied: That incident is different, as the case <b>there</b> is referring <b>to one who issues directives due to</b> his expectation of his imminent <b>death.</b>
<b>Ravina raised an objection to Rava</b> from a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 13a): In the case of <b>one who says: Give this bill of divorce to my wife, or:</b> Give <b>this bill of manumission to my slave, and</b> then he <b>dies, one should not give it after</b> his <b>death.</b> But if one says: <b>Give one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and</b> then he <b>died, one does give</b> the recipient the money <b>after</b> his <b>death.</b> This indicates that a gift of a person on his deathbed that includes only a part of his property does not require an act of acquisition.
<b>And from where</b> can one learn <b>that</b> the money <b>was not acquired from him</b> by means of an act of acquisition? This is learned from the fact that this <i>halakha</i> was juxtaposed to the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a bill of divorce, indicating that this case is <b>similar to a bill of divorce. Just as a bill of divorce is not subject to</b> the standard <i>halakhot</i> of an act of acquisition, <b>so too,</b> in <b>this</b> case of the gift of one hundred dinars, the mishna is referring to a case <b>where</b> the money <b>was not acquired from him</b> by means of an act of acquisition. Rava replied: <b>There, too,</b> the mishna is referring <b>to one who issues directives</b> with regard to his property <b>due to</b> his imminent <b>death.</b>
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said:</b> The gift of <b>one who issues directives</b> with regard to his property <b>due to</b> his expectation of his imminent <b>death generally requires</b> an act of <b>acquisition. And when it is taught</b> in <b>these <i>baraitot</i></b> that an act of acquisition is not required, the <i>baraitot</i> are referring <b>to one who divides all of his property</b> between different recipients, <b>as</b> in <b>that</b> case, the Sages <b>accorded</b> the gift the legal status of <b>a gift of a person on his deathbed.</b>
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a gift of a person on his deathbed</b> that includes only <b>a part</b> of his property <b>requires</b> an act of <b>acquisition;</b> otherwise it is invalid <b>even though he</b> subsequently <b>died,</b> and the gift is inherited by his heirs instead. The gift of <b>one who issues directives</b> with regard to his property <b>due to</b> his expectation of his imminent <b>death does not require</b> an act of <b>acquisition. And this</b> applies only <b>when</b> he subsequently <b>died.</b> If he <b>recovered,</b> he can <b>retract</b> his gift <b>even though it was acquired from him</b> by means of an act of acquisition.

Daf 152a

§ <b>It was stated</b> that the <i>amora’im</i> disagreed with regard to a deed pertaining to the <b>gift of a person on his deathbed in which</b> it <b>is written</b> that an act of <b>acquisition</b> was also performed. In <b>the study hall of Rav they say in the name of Rav:</b> The person on his deathbed <b>caused</b> the recipient <b>to mount two steeds,</b> i.e., he strengthened the validity of his gift in two different ways. <b>And Shmuel said: I do not know what I should rule with regard to this</b> gift, as it may not be a valid gift.
The Gemara explains: In <b>the study hall of Rav they say in the name of Rav</b> that <b>he caused him to mount two steeds.</b> On the one hand, <b>it is like</b> the <b>gift of a healthy person,</b> but on the other hand, <b>it is like</b> the <b>gift of a person on his deathbed. It is like</b> the <b>gift of a healthy person, as, if he recovers he cannot retract</b> the gift, because an act of acquisition was performed. <b>It is like</b> the <b>gift of a person on his deathbed, as, if he said</b> that the <b>loan</b> owed to <b>him</b> should be given <b>to so-and-so,</b> the <b>loan</b> owed to <b>him</b> is acquired <b>by so-and-so,</b> whereas a healthy person cannot transfer his right to collect a debt except in the presence of all three parties.
<b>And Shmuel said: I do not know what I should rule with regard to this</b> gift. <b>Perhaps</b> the fact that an act of acquisition was performed indicates that <b>he resolved to transfer it</b> to him <b>only with a deed.</b> The gift of a person on his deathbed takes effect only after he dies, <b>and a deed is not</b> effective if it is delivered <b>after</b> the <b>death</b> of the owner.
The Gemara <b>raises a contradiction between</b> this statement <b>of Rav and</b> another statement <b>of Rav, and between</b> this statement <b>of Shmuel and</b> another statement <b>of Shmuel.</b> This is <b>as Ravin sent in the name of Rabbi Abbahu: You should know that Rabbi Elazar sent</b> a ruling <b>to the Diaspora,</b> i.e., Babylonia, <b>in the name of our teacher,</b> Rav: With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who says: Write</b> a deed <b>and give</b> with it <b>one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and</b> he <b>died</b> before the deed was written, <b>it is not written and given</b> to that person. The reason for this is that <b>perhaps he resolved to transfer</b> the gift to him <b>only with</b> the <b>deed, and a deed is not</b> effective if it is delivered <b>after</b> the <b>death</b> of the owner. <b>And Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that the deed <b>is written and given</b> to the recipient.
The Gemara concludes: The first statement <b>of Rav is difficult,</b> as it is apparently contradicted <b>by</b> the other statement <b>of Rav,</b> and the first statement <b>of Shmuel is difficult,</b> as it is apparently contradicted <b>by</b> the other statement <b>of Shmuel.</b>
The Gemara replies: The apparent contradiction <b>between</b> the first statement <b>of Rav</b> and the other statement <b>of Rav</b> is <b>not difficult. This</b> statement, that the gift is valid, is referring to a case <b>where</b> the gift <b>was acquired from</b> the person on his deathbed by means of an act of acquisition. <b>That</b> other statement is referring to a case <b>where</b> the gift <b>was not acquired from him</b> by means of an act of acquisition, but only by verbal instruction, and therefore the deed is not written after his death. The apparent contradiction <b>between</b> the first statement <b>of Shmuel</b> and the other statement <b>of Shmuel</b> is <b>not difficult,</b> as Shmuel’s statement that the deed is written after his death is referring to a case <b>where</b> the giver was clearly <b>enhancing the</b> legal <b>power</b> of the recipient by providing him with a deed, and he was not making the gift contingent upon the delivery of a deed.
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak was sitting behind Rava, and Rava was sitting before Rav Naḥman,</b> and Rava <b>asked</b> Rav Naḥman: <b>Did Shmuel</b> actually <b>say</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the fact that an act of acquisition was performed indicates that the person on his deathbed <b>resolved to transfer</b> ownership of the gift <b>only with</b> the <b>deed, and</b> therefore the gift is invalid, as <b>a deed is not</b> effective if it is delivered <b>after</b> the <b>death</b> of the owner? <b>But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who wrote</b> a deed granting <b>all of his property to others, even though</b> they <b>performed an act of acquisition,</b> if <b>he recovers he can retract</b> his gift?

Daf 152b

The reason for Shmuel’s ruling is that <b>it is known that</b> an act of <b>acquisition</b> was performed <b>only due to</b> his expectation of imminent <b>death.</b> This ruling indicates that if the giver does not recover, the recipient acquires the gift, and the performance of an act of acquisition does not indicate that the giver intended to transfer the property only after his death. Rav Naḥman <b>indicated</b> the answer <b>to</b> Rava <b>with</b> a gesture of <b>his hand, and</b> Rava <b>was silent.</b>
<b>When</b> Rav Naḥman <b>arose</b> from his place, <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said to Rava: What did he indicate to you</b> with that gesture? Rava <b>said to him:</b> He indicated that the statement of Rav Yehuda is referring to a case <b>where</b> the giver was clearly <b>enhancing the</b> legal <b>power</b> of the recipient by requiring an act of acquisition to be performed in addition to bestowing the gift.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is considered</b> an act of acquisition that <b>enhances the</b> legal <b>power</b> of the recipient? <b>Rav Ḥisda said:</b> An act of acquisition is clearly intended only to reinforce the legal power of the recipient when, for example, the following phrase is written in the deed: <b>And we,</b> the witnesses, <b>acquired</b> it <b>from him</b> by means of an act of acquisition <b>in addition to this gift.</b> This indicates that the act of acquisition was not performed in order to effect the actual acquisition.
§ It is <b>obvious</b> that if a person on his deathbed <b>wrote</b> a deed of transfer granting his property <b>to this</b> individual, <b>and</b> he then <b>wrote</b> a deed granting the same property <b>to that</b> individual, i.e., a second recipient, <b>this is</b> the case discussed by Rav Dimi. <b>As when Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he <b>said:</b> A later <b>will [<i>dayetikei</i>] nullifies</b> an earlier <b>will.</b> The <i>amora’im</i> disagree with regard to a case where one <b>wrote</b> a deed of transfer <b>and</b> also <b>conferred possession</b> of the property <b>on this</b> individual, and then he <b>wrote</b> a deed of transfer <b>and conferred possession</b> of the same property <b>on that</b> second individual. <b>Rav says:</b> The <b>first</b> recipient <b>acquires</b> the gift, <b>and Shmuel says:</b> The <b>second</b> recipient <b>acquires</b> the gift.
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav says</b> that the <b>first</b> recipient <b>acquires</b> the gift. Since an additional act of conferring possession of the property was performed, the gift <b>is</b> considered <b>like</b> the <b>gift of a healthy person,</b> which cannot be retracted. <b>Shmuel says</b> that the <b>second</b> recipient <b>acquires</b> the gift because <b>it is</b> considered <b>like</b> the <b>gift of a person on his deathbed,</b> which can be retracted.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t</b> Rav and Shmuel already <b>disagree about this</b> matter <b>once? With regard to</b> a deed pertaining to the <b>gift of a person on his deathbed in which</b> it <b>is written</b> that an act of <b>acquisition</b> was also performed, Rav maintained that the gift cannot be retracted, whereas Shmuel maintained that the acquisition was not effective. Why is it necessary to record another disagreement with regard to the same principle?
The Gemara replies: It <b>is necessary</b> to cite both cases. This is <b>because if it were stated</b> only <b>with regard to that</b> case, where an act of acquisition was recorded in the deed, one might say that only <b>in that</b> case <b>Rav says</b> that the gift cannot be retracted, <b>because an act of acquisition was</b> performed. <b>But in this</b> case, <b>where an act of acquisition was not</b> performed, one might <b>say</b> that <b>he concedes to Shmuel. And if it was stated</b> only <b>with regard to this</b> case, where he conferred possession of the property on the recipient through a deed alone, one might say that only <b>in this</b> case <b>Shmuel says</b> that he can retract the gift. <b>But in the other</b> case, where an act of acquisition was recorded in the deed, one might <b>say</b> that Shmuel <b>concedes to Rav</b> that he cannot retract it. Therefore, it <b>is necessary</b> to cite both cases.
<b>In Sura they taught</b> the statements of Rav and Shmuel <b>that way,</b> as stated above. <b>In Pumbedita they taught</b> their statements <b>like this: Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says:</b> After the death of Rav, the following question <b>was sent from the study hall of Rav to Shmuel: Let our teacher teach us:</b> With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who wrote</b> a deed of transfer granting <b>all</b> of <b>his property to others, and they performed an act of acquisition, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Shmuel <b>sent to them</b> in reply: <b>After</b> an act of <b>acquisition</b> is performed, <b>nothing</b> can effect a retraction of the gift.

Daf 153a

Rav’s disciples <b>understood from this</b> that <b>this statement</b> applies only when the person on his deathbed wishes to retract his gift and transfer it <b>to another. But</b> if he recovers and wishes to retract the gift and retain it <b>for himself,</b> Shmuel’s statement <b>does not</b> apply. <b>Rav Ḥisda said to them: When Rav Huna came from Kufrei, he explained</b> that Shmuel’s statement applies <b>both</b> to retaining the property <b>for himself and</b> to transferring it <b>to others.</b>
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> person on his deathbed who wrote a deed of transfer granting his property to another, and <b>it was acquired from him</b> by means of an act of acquisition. He subsequently recovered and wanted to retract the gift, and <b>he came before Rav Huna.</b> Rav Huna <b>said</b> to him: <b>What can I do for you?</b> You cannot retract the gift, <b>as you did not transfer</b> the gift <b>in the manner that people</b> on their deathbed <b>transfer</b> ownership of gifts, and you enhanced the legal power of the recipient by performing an act of acquisition.
§ The Gemara relates: There was a deed pertaining to <b>a certain gift</b> of a person on his deathbed, <b>in which it was written</b> that the gift is given both <b>in life and in death.</b> In such a case, <b>Rav says: It is like</b> the <b>gift of a person on his deathbed,</b> and if he recovers he can retract it. <b>And Shmuel says: It is like</b> the <b>gift of a healthy person,</b> and he cannot retract it.
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav says: It is like</b> the <b>gift of a person on his deathbed.</b> This can be inferred <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written in</b> the deed that the gift is given <b>in death.</b> This means that the giver <b>is saying to him</b> that the gift should take effect <b>after</b> his <b>death, and that which is written</b> in the deed, that the gift is given <b>in life,</b> is <b>merely</b> an auspicious <b>omen,</b> expressing hope <b>that</b> the giver <b>will live.</b>
<b>And Shmuel says: It is like</b> the <b>gift of a healthy person.</b> This can be inferred <b>from</b> the fact <b>that it is written in</b> the deed that the gift is given <b>in life.</b> This means that the giver <b>is saying</b> that the gift takes effect <b>during</b> his <b>life,</b> i.e., immediately. <b>And that which he wrote,</b> that the gift is given <b>in death, is like one who says: From now and for evermore,</b> i.e., that the gift is not retractable. The Sages <b>of Neharde’a say: The <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav.</b>
<b>Rava said: And if it was written in</b> the deed that the gift is given <b>during life</b> and in death, the recipient <b>acquires</b> the gift and it cannot be retracted, as this term indicates that the gift takes effect while the giver still lives.
<b>Ameimar said: The <i>halakha</i> is not in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rava. Rav Ashi said to Ameimar:</b> Isn’t that <b>obvious, as</b> the Sages <b>of Neharde’a say</b> that <b>the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav?</b> Ameimar replied: <b>Lest you say</b> that with regard to the term: <b>During life, Rav concedes</b> that the giver intends for the gift to take effect immediately, Ameimar <b>teaches us</b> that since the giver also mentioned death, he intended the gift as the gift of a person on his deathbed and he can retract it.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> person who wrote in the deed that the gift is given in life and in death. When he recovered he wanted to retract the gift. He <b>came before Rav Naḥman in Neharde’a.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>sent him to</b> appear <b>before Rabbi Yirmeya bar Abba in Shum Tamya.</b> Rav Naḥman <b>said</b> in explanation of his actions: <b>Here,</b> Neharde’a, <b>is the place of Shmuel.</b> Consequently, Shmuel’s rulings should be followed, and therefore <b>how can we act in accordance with</b> the opinion <b>of Rav?</b>
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> woman who wrote in the deed that the gift is given during life and in death. She <b>came before Rava. Rava acted with regard to her</b> case <b>in accordance with his halakhic</b> ruling, and he ruled that she cannot retract the gift. She did not accept the ruling, and <b>she</b> constantly <b>troubled him,</b> saying that he had not judged her case properly.
Rava <b>said to Rav Pappa, his scribe, son of Rav Ḥanan: Go, write for her</b> a ruling in her favor, <b>and write in</b> the ruling the phrase: He may <b>hire</b> replacements <b>at their</b> expense, <b>or deceive them</b> to get them to return to work. This is a phrase from the mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 75b) that discusses the ruling in the case of one who hired laborers to perform a task that cannot be delayed, and they quit. Rava intended this phrase to indicate to the court that the ruling was merely a ruse in order to persuade the woman to leave. The woman understood the ruse. <b>She said: May his ship sink; you are deceiving me. Rava had his clothes immersed in water</b> so that the curse should be fulfilled in this alternative manner, <b>but even so he was not saved from</b> the <b>sinking</b> of his ship.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If one <b>did not write in</b> the deed that he was <b>on his deathbed,</b> and he then recovered and wished to retract the gift, and <b>he says: I was on my deathbed,</b> and since I recovered, I can retract the gift, <b>but</b> the recipients <b>say: You were healthy,</b> and the gift cannot be retracted, the giver <b>must bring proof that he was on his deathbed</b> in order to retract the gift. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: The burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> and since the property is in the possession of the giver, the recipients must bring proof that they have the right to receive it.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> There was a deed pertaining to <b>a certain gift</b> of a person on his deathbed, <b>in which it was written</b> that the gift was bestowed <b>when</b> the giver <b>was sick and lying in his bed, but</b> the continuation of the standard formula: <b>And from his sickness he departed to his</b> eternal <b>home, was not written in it.</b> The giver’s heirs claimed that although he was ill when he wrote the deed, he later recovered, and his gift is not valid.

Daf 153b

<b>Rabba said: He is dead, and his grave proves</b> that <b>he</b> died. It may therefore be assumed that he did not recover from his sickness, and his gift remains valid. <b>Abaye said to him: And now, if</b> in the case of <b>a ship</b> that sank, <b>where</b> the fate of <b>most of</b> the passengers of sunken ships is <b>to perish,</b> the <b>stringencies of</b> the <b>living and</b> the <b>stringencies of</b> the <b>dead are applied to them</b> due to the uncertainty as to whether they are alive or dead, in the case of <b>sick people, where</b> the fate of <b>most sick people</b> is <b>to</b> return to <b>life, all the more so</b> is it <b>not</b> clear that one should assume that he recovered from the illness and his gift is invalid?
<b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, said: In accordance with whose</b> opinion <b>is that <i>halakha</i> of Rabba?</b> It is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to a case where one who gave his property to others claims that since he was on his deathbed at the time he can retract the gifts, and the recipients claim that he was healthy and cannot retract it, <b>who removes</b> the property <b>from whose possession?</b> The giver <b>can remove</b> it <b>from</b> the recipients’ <b>possession without proof,</b> as the property was previously established to be in his possession, <b>but</b> the recipients <b>can remove</b> it <b>from</b> the giver’s <b>possession only with proof.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Ya’akov.</b>
<b>Rabbi Natan says:</b> The presumption is that the current situation reflects the situation at the time the gift was bestowed. Therefore, <b>if he is</b> currently <b>healthy,</b> the obligation <b>is upon him to bring proof that he was on his deathbed</b> when he gave his property to others. <b>If he is</b> currently <b>on his deathbed,</b> the obligation <b>is upon</b> the recipients <b>to bring proof that he was healthy</b> then.
<b>Rabbi Elazar says: And with regard to</b> a case of uncertain <b>ritual impurity,</b> the <i>halakha</i> depends <b>on</b> the same <b>dispute.</b> This is <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Teharot</i> 6:7): The <i>halakha</i> is that a case where it is uncertain if something or someone became impure in the public domain, the item or person is deemed pure. With regard to <b>an expanse of fields, in the summer,</b> when many people pass through the fields, it <b>is</b> considered <b>the private domain with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>Shabbat, but</b> it is considered <b>the public domain with regard to</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>ritual impurity,</b> and if one is uncertain as to whether he was rendered impure there, he is deemed pure.
<b>In the rainy season,</b> when not many people pass through the fields, an expanse of fields is considered <b>the private domain</b> both <b>with regard to this,</b> Shabbat, <b>and with regard to that,</b> ritual impurity. Therefore, if one is uncertain whether he was rendered impure there, he is deemed impure. If one does not know whether the day he entered the expanse of fields was considered part of the summer or the rainy season, and he is uncertain whether he was rendered impure there, Rabbi Ya’akov maintains that he retains the status of purity that he held before entering the fields. According to Rabbi Natan, it is presumed that he entered the fields during the same season in which he came to ask whether he was rendered impure.
<b>Rava</b> disagrees with Rabbi Elazar and <b>says: They taught</b> the ruling of the mishna <b>only</b> with regard to a case <b>where the rainy season has not</b> yet <b>passed over</b> the fields after the possibility arose that the fields contained impurity. <b>But</b> if <b>the rainy season has</b> already <b>passed over</b> the fields, it is considered <b>the private domain</b> both <b>with regard to this,</b> Shabbat, <b>and with regard to that,</b> ritual impurity. Even though the one who passed through the fields came to ask about his status in the summer, when the fields should be considered the public domain, he is nevertheless deemed impure even according to Rabbi Natan, and there is no parallel dispute with regard to uncertain ritual impurity.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And the Rabbis say: The burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> and since the property is in the possession of the giver, the recipients must bring proof that they have the right to receive it.

Daf 154a

The Gemara asks: With regard to the <b>proof</b> that the recipients must bring, <b>in what</b> manner is it brought? <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The <b>proof</b> is presented <b>by</b> bringing <b>witnesses</b> who testify that the giver was healthy. <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna say:</b> The <b>proof</b> is presented <b>by</b> the <b>ratification of the deed,</b> i.e., the recipients are required only to ascertain that the signatures of the witnesses on the deed are authentic in order to prove that it is not forged.
The Gemara explains: <b>Rav Huna says</b> that the <b>proof</b> is presented <b>by</b> bringing <b>witnesses.</b> He maintains that Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute of Rabbi Ya’akov and Rabbi Natan</b> in the <i>baraita</i> (153b).
The Gemara notes <b>a mnemonic</b> device that indicates which tannaitic opinions are correlated: <b><i>Manniaḥ</i>,</b> which represents the letters <i>mem</i>, <i>nun</i>, <i>yod</i>, <i>ḥet</i>, stands for Meir, Natan, Ya’akov, and the Rabbis [<i>ḥakhamim</i>]. This indicates that <b>Rabbi Meir,</b> who says that the giver must bring proof that he was on his deathbed, holds <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Natan,</b> who maintains that one presumes that the current situation reflects the situation at the time the gift was bestowed. <b>And the Rabbis,</b> who say that the recipients must bring proof that the giver was healthy, hold <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Ya’akov.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna say</b> that the <b>proof</b> is presented <b>by</b> the <b>ratification of the deed.</b> The Gemara explains: Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna maintain that Rabbi Meir and the Rabbis <b>disagree with regard to</b> whether when there is a debtor <b>who admits that he wrote</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>must ratify it</b> in court in order to collect payment. The same ruling would apply to a case where the person on his deathbed admits that he wrote the deed granting the gift. They explain <b>that Rabbi Meir holds</b> that when there is a debtor <b>who admits that he wrote</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>need not ratify it</b> in court in order to collect payment, and in this case the giver cannot invalidate the deed by claiming that he was on his deathbed. <b>But the Rabbis hold</b> that even when there is a debtor <b>who admits that he wrote</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>must ratify it</b> in court in order to collect payment.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t they</b> already <b>disagree with regard to this</b> matter <b>once? As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to witnesses who ratified their signatures but claimed that at the time they signed the document they were not fit to bear witness, their testimony is <b>not deemed credible to invalidate</b> the document; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> Their testimony is <b>deemed credible.</b>
The Gemara answers: It <b>is necessary</b> to state both cases, <b>because if</b> only <b>that</b> case with regard to witnesses who disqualified their testimony <b>was stated,</b> one might think that <b>the Sages say</b> that their testimony is accepted only <b>in that</b> case, <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses is powerful and they can impair</b> the validity of the <b>document, but here,</b> with regard to <b>him,</b> the giver, <b>who</b> admitted that he wrote the deed but it <b>is not in his</b> power to impair the validity of the deed, <b>I would say</b> that his claim is <b>not</b> accepted.
<b>And if</b> only <b>this</b> case, with regard to a debtor who admits that he wrote a promissory note, <b>was stated,</b> one might think that <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that the giver cannot invalidate the deed only <b>with regard to this</b> case, <b>but with regard to that</b> case, where the witnesses ratified their signatures, <b>I would say</b> that Rabbi Meir <b>concedes to the Rabbis</b> that witnesses can invalidate the deed. Therefore, it <b>is necessary</b> to state the dispute in both cases.
<b>And Rabba also says:</b> With regard to the <b>proof</b> that the recipients must present, it is presented <b>by</b> bringing <b>witnesses</b> who testify that the giver was healthy. <b>Abaye said to him: What is the reason</b> for this? <b>If we say</b> that <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that in all</b> deeds of gift the following formulation <b>is written: When he was walking on his feet in the marketplace,</b> which indicates that the gift was the gift of a healthy person, <b>and in this</b> deed this <b>was not written,</b> therefore one may <b>conclude from</b> the deed that the giver <b>was on his deathbed,</b> that is not correct. <b>On the contrary,</b> one could say that <b>due to</b> the fact <b>that in all</b> deeds concerning the gifts of a person on his deathbed the following <b>is written: When he was sick and lying in his bed, and in this</b> deed this <b>was not written,</b> therefore one may <b>conclude from</b> the deed that the giver <b>was healthy.</b>
Rabba replied: Since one <b>can say this and</b> one <b>can say that,</b> nothing can be concluded from the formulation of the deed. Therefore, due to the uncertainty, <b>establish the property in the possession of its</b> last known <b>owner.</b>
<b>And</b> this dispute with regard to the statement of the Rabbis is also the subject <b>of a dispute</b> between other <i>amora’im</i>, <b>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> The <b>proof</b> is presented <b>by</b> bringing <b>witnesses, and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says:</b> The <b>proof</b> is presented <b>by</b> the <b>ratification of the deed.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan raised an objection to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish</b> from a <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident in Bnei Brak involving one who sold</b> some <b>of his father’s property</b> that he had inherited, <b>and he died, and</b> the <b>members of</b> his <b>family came and contested</b> the sale, <b>saying: He was a minor at the time of</b> his <b>death,</b> and therefore the sale was not valid. <b>And they came and asked Rabbi Akiva: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it permitted to exhume the corpse in order <b>to examine it</b> and ascertain whether or not the heir was a minor at the time of his death? Rabbi Akiva <b>said to them:</b> It is <b>not permitted</b> for <b>you to disgrace him</b> for the sake of a monetary claim. <b>And furthermore, signs</b> indicating puberty <b>are likely to change after death,</b> and therefore nothing can be proved by exhuming the body.

Daf 154b

Rabbi Yoḥanan explains: <b>Granted, according to my</b> explanation of the mishna, <b>that I say</b> that the <b>proof</b> must be presented <b>by</b> bringing <b>witnesses,</b> I can explain the <i>baraita</i>. <b>Since</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to the buyers: Bring witnesses, and they did not find</b> witnesses, <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that they came and said to him: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it permitted <b>to examine him? But according to you, that you say</b> that the <b>proof</b> is presented <b>by ratification of the deed, why do they</b> need <b>to examine him? Let them ratify their deed and they shall be established</b> as owners <b>of the property.</b>
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish replies: <b>Do you maintain</b> that <b>the property stood in the possession of</b> the <b>members of</b> his <b>family and the buyers came and contested</b> their possession of the property? Rather, <b>the property stood in the possession of</b> the <b>buyers, and</b> the <b>members of</b> his <b>family came and contested</b> the sale. Since they claimed that the deed was invalid, they could not prove their claim by ratifying the deed, but only by bringing witnesses or examining the body.
<b>This, too, stands to reason, as</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to</b> the claimants: <b>You are not permitted to disgrace him, and they were silent. Granted, if you say</b> that the <b>members of</b> his <b>family were contesting</b> the sale, <b>due to that</b> reason <b>they were silent,</b> as they accepted that they should not disgrace their relative. <b>But if you say</b> that the <b>buyers were contesting</b> the claim of the relatives, <b>why were they silent? They should have said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>We gave him money,</b> and if our right to the property cannot be proven without disgracing him, <b>let him be disgraced.</b>
The Gemara rejects this argument: <b>If it is due to that</b> reason, i.e., this claim they could have said, <b>there is no</b> conclusive <b>argument. This is what</b> Rabbi Akiva <b>said to them: One</b> reason to prohibit exhuming the body is <b>that you are not permitted to disgrace him. And furthermore, if you should say: He took</b> the <b>money; let him be disgraced,</b> in any event nothing can be proved by exhuming the body, as <b>signs</b> indicating puberty <b>are likely to change after death.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof: <b>Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish asked Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> about <b>that which is taught in the Mishna of bar Kappara:</b> There was one <b>who was continually enjoying</b> the profits from <b>a field,</b> and it was the <b>presumption that it was his, and someone contested his</b> claim, <b>saying: It is mine. And that</b> person, who was profiting from the field, <b>produced a deed,</b> in order <b>to say:</b> It is mine, <b>as you sold</b> this field <b>to me, or:</b> It is mine, <b>as you gave me</b> this field <b>as a gift. If</b> the one who protested his claim <b>said: I do not recognize that deed</b> as one that I have <b>ever</b> written, <b>the deed</b> must <b>be ratified through its signatures.</b>
<b>If</b> the one who protested his claim <b>said: This is a document of appeasement [<i>shtar passim</i>],</b> a document written only so that the holder should appear wealthy, <b>or a document of trust,</b> which means <b>that I sold</b> the field <b>to you</b> and provided you with the deed, trusting you to provide payment, <b>and</b> since <b>you did not give me</b> the <b>money</b> the sale is void, then <b>if there are witnesses, follow</b> the testimony of the <b>witnesses, and if not, follow the deed.</b>
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish concludes: According to your explanation, the Rabbis maintain that even if the deed is ratified the claimant cannot take possession of the property without bringing witnesses. If so, <b>shall we say</b> that <b>this</b> <i>baraita</i> <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says</b> that when there is a debtor <b>who admits that he wrote</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>is not required to ratify it</b> in court in order to collect payment, <b>and</b> it is <b>not</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>the Rabbis?</b>
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: <b>No,</b> it is not so. <b>As I say</b> that <b>everyone agrees</b> that in the case of a debtor <b>who admits that he wrote</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>is not required to ratify it</b> in court in order to collect payment. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish asked: <b>But don’t they disagree, as we learned</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to witnesses who ratified their signatures but claimed that they were not fit to bear witness when they signed the deed, their testimony is <b>not deemed credible to invalidate</b> the document; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> Their testimony is <b>deemed credible.</b>
Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: Even <b>if</b> the testimony of <b>witnesses is powerful and they impair</b> the validity of the <b>deed,</b> which they admit to have written, with regard to <b>him,</b> the giver, <b>is it in his</b> power to impair the validity of a deed that he admits to have written? Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>But wasn’t it stated in your name</b> with regard to the aforementioned incident in Bnei Brak: The <b>members of</b> his <b>family contested</b> the claim <b>correctly,</b> even though they admitted that the deed was authentic? This means that the claimant is required to ratify the deed. Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to</b> Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: <b>That</b> statement <b>was stated</b> in my name by Rabbi <b>Elazar,</b> my disciple, but <b>I never said that statement.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira says: If Rabbi Yoḥanan denies</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Elazar, his disciple, will</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan also <b>deny that</b> which he said to <b>Rabbi Yannai, his teacher?</b> This is <b>as Rabbi Yannai says</b> that <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>says:</b> When there is a debtor <b>who admits that he wrote</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>is not required to ratify it</b> in court in order to collect the payment. <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan said to</b> Rabbi Yannai: <b>My teacher, is this not</b> the case discussed in <b>our mishna,</b> which states to the contrary: <b>And the Rabbis say: The burden of proof rests upon the claimant?</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan concludes: The <b>proof</b> mentioned in this mishna <b>is nothing other</b> than <b>ratification of the deed.</b> This indicates that Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that according to the opinion of the Rabbis, the recipient is required to ratify the deed. If so, why does he state that everyone agrees that the recipient is not required to ratify the deed?
Rabbi Zeira explains: <b>Indeed, the statement of our teacher,</b> Rav <b>Yosef, appears</b> to be correct, <b>as our teacher</b> Rav <b>Yosef says</b> that <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> The opinions here should be reversed. <b>This,</b> the <i>baraita</i> taught by bar Kappara, according to which the deed does not require ratification, <b>is the statement of the Rabbis. But Rabbi Meir says</b> that when there is a debtor <b>who admits that he wrote</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>is not required to ratify it</b> in court in order to collect payment. <b>And what</b> is the meaning of Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that <b>everyone agrees</b> that in this case, the recipient is not required to ratify the deed? Rabbi Yoḥanan means that this is the statement of the Rabbis, and a statement <b>of the Rabbis that</b> is disputed only <b>by Rabbi Meir is</b> tantamount to <b>a statement</b> accepted <b>by all.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn the opposite</b> in the mishna: <b>And the Rabbis say</b> that <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant?</b> This means that the recipient is required to ratify the deed. The Gemara replies: <b>Reverse</b> the opinions in the mishna. The Gemara asks: <b>But isn’t it taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to witnesses who ratified their signatures but claimed that they were not fit to bear witness, their testimony is <b>not deemed credible to invalidate</b> the document; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say:</b> Their testimony is <b>deemed credible.</b> This indicates that according to the Rabbis the document requires ratification. The Gemara answers: Here too, <b>reverse</b> the opinions.
The Gemara asks: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say</b> with regard to the proof that the recipient is required to bring, that the <b>proof</b> is presented <b>by</b> bringing <b>witnesses</b> who testify that the giver was healthy, and not by ratifying the deed? The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the opinions of Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish. Rabbi Yoḥanan maintains that the recipient is required to prove his claim only by ratifying the deed, whereas Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish maintains that the recipient is required to bring witnesses. The Gemara asks: <b>Shall we say</b> that we should <b>also reverse the objection</b> that Rabbi Yoḥanan raised to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish previously, and say that Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish raised the objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan? The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> that is unnecessary.

Daf 155a

<b>This is what Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: Granted, according to my</b> explanation of the mishna, <b>that I say</b> that presenting <b>proof through</b> the <b>ratification of the deed</b> is sufficient in order to enable the recipient to claim the gift, <b>this is</b> the reason <b>that</b> with regard to the incident in Bnei Brak <b>you find</b> the possibility <b>that the buyers take possession of the property</b> by ratifying the deed. It is therefore possible that the buyers held the property, and the relatives were claiming it from them. <b>But according to you, that you say</b> that the <b>proof</b> must be presented <b>by</b> bringing <b>witnesses, how can you find</b> circumstances in <b>which the buyers take possession of the property,</b> since they have no proof?
Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan: <b>I concede to you with regard to</b> a case <b>where</b> the <b>members of</b> the deceased’s <b>family contested</b> the legality of the buyers’ claim <b>that</b> their <b>contesting</b> the legality of that claim <b>is not</b> taken into consideration, since they are contesting the deed held by the buyers. It is therefore possible for the buyers to take possession of the property, as in this case <b>what do</b> the relatives <b>say?</b> They say that the seller <b>was a minor.</b> But there is a <b>presumption</b> that <b>witnesses do not sign the document unless</b> the seller <b>has become an adult.</b> In the mishna, by contrast, there is no presumption that counters the giver’s claim that he was on his deathbed. The recipient is therefore required to bring proof that the giver was healthy.
§ <b>It was stated</b> that there was a dispute with regard to the following matter: <b>From when,</b> i.e., from what age, <b>can a minor sell his</b> deceased <b>father’s property? Rava</b> says that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> From the time he is <b>eighteen years old, and Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana</b> says that <b>Rav Naḥman says: From</b> the time he is <b>twenty years old.</b> The Gemara notes: <b>And this</b> statement <b>of Rava was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference.</b>
<b>Rabbi Zeira raises an objection</b> from the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: There was <b>an incident in Bnei Brak involving one who sold</b> some <b>of his father’s property,</b> which he had inherited, <b>and he died, and</b> the <b>members of</b> his <b>family came and contested</b> the sale, <b>saying: He was a minor at the time of</b> his <b>death,</b> and therefore the sale was not valid. <b>And they came and asked Rabbi Akiva: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it permitted to exhume the corpse in order <b>to examine it</b> and ascertain whether or not the heir was a minor at the time of his death? Rabbi Akiva <b>said to them:</b> It is <b>not permitted</b> for <b>you to disgrace him</b> for the sake of a monetary claim. <b>And furthermore, signs</b> indicating puberty <b>are likely to change after death,</b> and therefore nothing can be proved by exhuming the body. Rabbi Zeira explains the objection: <b>Granted, according to the one who says</b> that the heir can sell the property once he is <b>eighteen years old,</b>

Daf 155b

<b>this is</b> the reason <b>that they came and said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>What is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it permitted <b>to examine</b> the corpse? <b>But if you say</b> that he can sell the property <b>from</b> the time he is <b>twenty</b> years <b>old,</b> even <b>if they examine him, what of it? But didn’t we learn</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 47b): With regard to <b>a twenty-</b>year<b>-old</b> man <b>who did not develop two</b> pubic <b>hairs, proof must be brought that he is twenty</b> years <b>old,</b> and then he is no longer considered a minor. <b>And he is the sexually underdeveloped man,</b> who is excluded from the mitzva of levirate marriage. Therefore, if his married brother dies childless, <b>he neither performs <i>ḥalitza</i> nor enters into levirate marriage</b> with his widow. Since a twenty-year-old is considered an adult even if he has not developed signs of puberty, there is no reason to examine the body.
The Gemara replies: <b>Wasn’t it stated with regard to that</b> mishna: <b>Rabbi Shmuel bar Rav Yitzḥak says</b> that <b>Rav says: And</b> is <b>this</b> the <i>halakha</i> only <b>where he developed the signs of a sexually underdeveloped man?</b> Otherwise, a twenty-year-old who has not developed two pubic hairs is still considered a minor. The examination of the deceased could therefore be effective to see if he has other signs of being sexually underdeveloped. <b>Rava said:</b> The language of the mishna <b>is also precise, as it teaches: And he is the sexually underdeveloped man.</b> The usage of the definitive article indicates that the mishna is referring to one who is clearly a sexually underdeveloped man. The Gemara affirms: One can <b>conclude from</b> the mishna that the mishna is speaking of one who developed the signs of a sexually underdeveloped man.
The Gemara asks: <b>And if he did not develop the signs of a sexually underdeveloped man, until when</b> is he considered a minor if he does not develop two pubic hairs? <b>Rabbi Ḥiyya teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: He is considered a minor <b>until most of his years</b> have elapsed, i.e., until he is thirty-five years old. <b>When</b> the case of one who had not developed pubic hair <b>would come before Rabbi Ḥiyya,</b> he would offer the following advice: <b>If</b> the person was <b>thin, he</b> would <b>say to</b> those appearing in court: Cause him <b>to become fat, and if he was fat, he</b> would <b>say to them:</b> Cause him <b>to become thin.</b> This is <b>because these signs</b> indicating puberty <b>sometimes develop due to</b> excessive <b>thinness,</b> and <b>sometimes they develop due to corpulence.</b>
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>During</b> the <b>time,</b> i.e., the year, when a minor comes of age with regard to selling his deceased father’s property, i.e., during his eighteenth or twentieth year, is this year considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time</b> that he comes of age <b>or</b> is it considered <b>as after</b> the <b>time?</b> Does one come of age at the beginning or end of that year? <b>Rava says</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says: During</b> that <b>time</b> is considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time,</b> and he does not come of age until the year has elapsed. <b>Rava bar Rav Sheila</b> says that <b>Rav Naḥman says: During</b> that <b>time</b> is considered <b>as after</b> the <b>time,</b> and he is considered as having come of age during that year.
The Gemara notes: <b>And this</b> statement <b>of Rava was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference. As</b> there was <b>a certain</b> person who was <b>during</b> the <b>time,</b> i.e., the year, when one comes of age <b>who went</b> and <b>sold</b> his father’s <b>property, and</b> the case <b>came before Rava.</b> Rava <b>said to</b> the litigants: <b>He did not do anything,</b> and the sale is not valid. <b>One who observed</b> Rava’s ruling <b>assumed</b> that he ruled in this manner <b>because</b> he maintained <b>that during</b> the <b>time</b> when he comes of age is considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time. But</b> that <b>is not so.</b> The reason for Rava’s ruling was that <b>there,</b> Rava <b>observed excessive mental incompetence in</b> the behavior of that individual, <b>as he was emancipating his slaves.</b> Since Rava saw that he was mentally incompetent, he invalidated the sale.
§ <b>Giddel bar Menashya sent</b> an inquiry <b>to Rava: Let our teacher instruct us:</b> With regard to <b>a girl</b> who is <b>fourteen years and one day old</b> who <b>understands the nature of business</b> negotiations, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Can she sell property that she inherited from her father? Rava <b>sent</b> a reply <b>to</b> Giddel bar Menashya: <b>If she understands the nature of business</b> negotiations <b>her purchase is</b> a valid <b>purchase and her sale is</b> a valid <b>sale.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> Giddel <b>could have sent</b> this question <b>to</b> Rava with regard to <b>a boy.</b> Why did he not do so? The Gemara answers: <b>The incident that took place, took place in this way.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But he could have sent</b> this question <b>to</b> Rava with regard to <b>a girl</b> who is <b>twelve years and one day old,</b> at which age a girl reaches her majority. Why did he not do so? The Gemara answers: <b>The incident that took place, took place in this way.</b>
The Gemara notes: <b>And this</b> statement <b>of Rava was not stated explicitly; rather, it was stated by inference, as</b> it was inferred from the following incident. There was <b>a certain</b> person who was <b>under twenty</b> years <b>old</b> and understood business negotiations <b>who went</b> and <b>sold his father’s property, in accordance with</b> the ruling that Rava sent to <b>Giddel bar Menashya,</b> and the case <b>came before Rava.</b> The seller’s <b>relatives said to</b> the one who sold the property: <b>Go eat dates and throw</b> the <b>pits into Rava’s house,</b> in order to prove to Rava that their relative was not mentally competent. <b>He did so.</b> Rava <b>said to them: His sale</b> is <b>not</b> a valid <b>sale.</b>
<b>When they were writing for him a writ</b> containing the decision, <b>the buyers said to</b> the seller, in order to prove that he was mentally competent: <b>Go</b> and <b>say to Rava: The scroll of Esther,</b> which is a large scroll, is bought <b>for a dinar.</b> Why then does <b>the</b> short <b>writ</b> containing <b>Master’s</b> ruling also cost <b>a dinar,</b> which was the scribe’s fee? The seller <b>went</b> and <b>said</b> this <b>to</b> Rava. Rava <b>said to them: His sale</b> is a valid <b>sale. The</b> boy’s <b>relatives said to</b> Rava: <b>The buyers taught him</b> to say that. Rava <b>said to them:</b> Even so, when <b>they explain</b> the matter <b>to him he understands. Since, when they explain</b> a matter <b>to him he understands, he knows</b> what he is doing. <b>And</b> the reason <b>that he acted</b> in <b>this</b> manner, throwing the pits into Rava’s house, was because of <b>excessive impudence that was in him,</b> not mental incompetence.
§ <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says: And with regard to</b> the <b>testimony</b> of one who is not old enough to sell property that he inherits from his father, <b>his testimony</b> is valid <b>testimony. Mar Zutra said: We said</b> that his testimony is valid <b>only with regard to movable property, but not with regard to land.</b>
<b>Rav Ashi said to Mar Zutra:</b> In <b>what</b> way <b>is movable property different</b> from land? It is different <b>because</b> with regard to movable property <b>his sale is</b> a valid <b>sale. But if that is so,</b> consider <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 59a): <b>A purchase</b> made <b>by young children</b> is a valid <b>purchase, and a sale</b> made by them is a valid <b>sale.</b> These <i>halakhot</i> apply <b>to</b> transactions involving <b>movable property.</b> Is it possible <b>that also</b> in the case of young children <b>their testimony</b> is valid <b>testimony?</b> Isn’t it an established <i>halakha</i> that minors are disqualified from bearing witness? Mar Zutra <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi: <b>There,</b> with regard to testimony, <b>I require</b> the witnesses to be men, as the verse states: <b>“Then the two men shall stand”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:17), which is interpreted as referring to witnesses, <b>and</b> this requirement is <b>not</b> fulfilled in the case of young children.
§ <b>Ameimar says:</b> With regard to one who is not old enough to sell property that he inherits from his father, if he gave a gift from the property, <b>his gift</b> is a valid <b>gift. Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: Now, if</b> with regard to <b>a sale,</b> in <b>which he receives money, you say</b> that the Sages instituted an ordinance <b>that</b> he is <b>not</b> authorized to sell, <b>lest he reduce</b> the price of the property and deplete his father’s estate, <b>all the more so</b> in the case of <b>a gift</b> he is not authorized to give a gift, <b>as nothing at all comes into his</b> possession in exchange. Ameimar <b>said to</b> Rav Ashi:

Daf 156a

<b>And according to your reasoning,</b> that the money he receives in exchange for the property is a reason one could consider his sale valid, if <b>he sold</b> property <b>worth five</b> dinars <b>for six</b> dinars, would <b>his sale also be</b> a valid <b>sale?</b>
<b>Rather, the Sages maintain that a child’s inclination</b> is to be <b>attracted to money. And if you say</b> that <b>his sale is</b> a valid <b>sale,</b> there may be <b>times</b> that there are potential buyers <b>who rattle the dinars</b> before <b>him</b> in order to tempt him to sell, and <b>he will go and sell all of his father’s property.</b> That is why the Sages ruled that all of his sales are not valid. <b>But with regard to a gift, if he did not</b> derive <b>benefit from</b> the recipient, <b>he would not give him a gift. The Sages</b> therefore <b>said: Let the gift</b> of an orphan <b>be</b> a valid <b>gift, so</b> that people <b>will perform</b> beneficial <b>matters for</b> the orphans, as the orphan can reciprocate by giving gifts.
§ <b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> Children who have reached the age of majority, i.e., a boy who is thirteen years old and a girl who is twelve years old, <b>are examined</b> for signs indicating puberty if it is necessary to determine their adulthood <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>betrothal, for</b> the purpose of <b>divorce, for</b> the purpose of <b><i>ḥalitza</i>, and</b> for the purpose of stating a girl’s <b>refusal</b> to remain married. <b>But</b> in order <b>to sell from the property that</b> one inherited from <b>his father,</b> the seller must be older, and one cannot sell this property <b>until</b> the seller <b>is twenty</b> years <b>old.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But once I examined</b> the boy <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>betrothal, why do I</b> need to examine him again <b>for</b> the purpose of <b>divorce?</b> The Gemara answers: This <b>is necessary only with regard to</b> the <b>levirate marriage</b> of a minor, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Nidda</i> 45a): A boy who is <b>nine years and one day old who engaged in intercourse with his <i>yevama</i>,</b> i.e., his brother’s widow, <b>acquired her</b> as his wife by means of engaging in the act of intercourse. Although a minor cannot betroth a woman under ordinary circumstances, in the case of levirate marriage the act of intercourse of a nine-year-old with his <i>yevama</i> effects acquisition. <b>But he cannot give</b> her <b>a bill of divorce until he reaches his majority.</b> It is therefore necessary to examine him at the time of the divorce.
The Gemara explains why it is necessary to mention examining a boy <b>for</b> the purpose of <b><i>ḥalitza</i>:</b> This is mentioned <b>to the exclusion of that which Rabbi Yosei</b> says, <b>as</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>says: “Man,”</b> i.e., an adult man, <b>is written in the</b> Torah <b>passage</b> with regard to <i>ḥalitza</i>, as the verse states: “And if the man does not wish to take his brother’s wife” (Deuteronomy 25:7). <b>But a woman, whether</b> she is <b>an adult or a minor,</b> can be released by <i>ḥalitza</i>, as the verse does not indicate her age. To counter this, Rav Naḥman <b>teaches us that a woman is juxtaposed to a man</b> in this passage, indicating that the <i>yevama</i> must also have reached adulthood, and the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei.</b>
The Gemara explains why it is necessary to mention examining a person <b>for</b> the purpose of stating her <b>refusal.</b> This is mentioned <b>to the exclusion of that which Rabbi Yehuda</b> says, <b>as</b> Rabbi Yehuda <b>says</b> that a girl whose mother or brother married her off while she was a minor can nullify her marriage by refusing to remain married, and she can state this refusal <b>until</b> she reaches complete maturity, i.e., <b>when</b> the area covered by <b>black</b> pubic hairs <b>is greater</b> than the skin of the genital area. Rav Naḥman therefore <b>teaches us that</b> the <i>halakha</i> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda,</b> and once a girl has developed two pubic hairs she cannot state her refusal.
Rav Naḥman states: <b>But</b> in order <b>to sell from the property that</b> one inherited from <b>his father,</b> the seller must be older, and he cannot sell the property <b>until he is twenty</b> years <b>old.</b> This is mentioned <b>to the exclusion of</b> the opinion of the <b>one who says</b> that the seller can be <b>eighteen</b> years <b>old.</b>
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that with regard to the age when a minor can sell property inherited from his father, <b>during</b> the <b>time,</b> i.e., during his twentieth year, is considered <b>as before</b> the <b>time</b> when it is permitted, and he cannot sell until the end of his twentieth year. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the ruling that Rava sent to <b>Giddel bar Menashe,</b> that a child who has reached his majority and understands the nature of business negotiations can sell land.
The Gemara continues: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Mar Zutra,</b> that one who is not fit to sell land is also not fit to bear witness with regard to land. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement of <b>Ameimar,</b> that an orphan under the age of twenty can bestow gifts from the property he inherited from his father. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the statement that <b>Rav Naḥman</b> says that <b>Shmuel says with regard to all</b> the matters that he mentioned.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> With regard to <b>one who divides his property</b> between various recipients <b>by</b> means of <b>verbal</b> instruction, <b>Rabbi Elazar says:</b> Both in the case of <b>one</b> who is <b>healthy and</b> in the case of <b>one</b> who is <b>dangerously ill,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is as follows: <b>Property that serves as a guarantee,</b> i.e., land, <b>is acquired by</b> means of <b>money, by a deed</b> of transfer, <b>or by taking possession</b> of it. <b>And that</b> which <b>does not serve as a guarantee,</b> i.e., movable property, <b>can be acquired only by pulling.</b>

Daf 156b

The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Elazar: There was <b>an incident involving the mother of the sons of Rokhel, who was sick, and</b> who <b>said: My brooch shall be given to my daughter, and it is</b> valued <b>at twelve hundred dinars. And</b> this woman subsequently <b>died, and</b> the Sages <b>upheld her statement.</b> This indicates that a person on his deathbed can gift property without an act of acquisition. Rabbi Elazar <b>said to them:</b> That case was different; <b>the sons of Rokhel should be buried by their mother,</b> i.e., he cursed them. It is not possible to bring a proof from this incident, as these sons were wicked people. Consequently, when ruling in this matter the Sages did not act in accordance with the <i>halakha</i>, but allowed the mother of the sons of Rokhel to give this valuable piece of jewelry to their sister without an act of acquisition having been performed.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>It is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Eliezer said to the Rabbis:</b> There was <b>an incident involving a certain</b> man <b>of Meron who was in Jerusalem, and he had a lot of movable property. And he desired to give</b> the movable property <b>as gifts</b> to various individuals, but they could not be acquired by pulling. The Rabbis <b>said to him: There is no remedy for</b> transferring the property <b>unless he transfers</b> the movable property <b>by means of</b> transferring the ownership of <b>land.</b>
<b>He went and acquired one</b> plot of <b>rocky</b> land <b>adjacent to Jerusalem, and</b> he <b>said:</b> I give <b>the north</b> part <b>of</b> this area <b>to so-and-so, and with it one hundred sheep and one hundred barrels. And</b> I give <b>the south</b> part <b>of</b> the area <b>to so-and-so, and with it one hundred sheep and one hundred barrels. And he died, and the Sages upheld his statement.</b> This indicates that a person on his deathbed cannot transfer property without an act of acquisition. The Rabbis <b>said to</b> Rabbi Eliezer: Do you bring <b>proof from there?</b> The man <b>of Meron was healthy</b> at the time. This was not the gift of a person on his deathbed, and it could not be acquired by verbal instruction.
§ The mishna teaches: Rabbi Elazar <b>said to them:</b> That case was different; <b>the sons of Rokhel should be buried by their mother.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> that <b>he was cursing them? Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says: They were maintaining thorns in a vineyard</b> and did not uproot them, <b>and Rabbi Eliezer</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kilayim</i> 5:8): With regard to <b>one who maintains thorns in a vineyard, Rabbi Eliezer says: He has proscribed</b> the vineyard, rendering it forbidden due to the prohibition against diverse kinds. <b>And the Rabbis say: Only</b> growing <b>a matter,</b> i.e., a crop, <b>the like of which</b> people usually <b>maintain, proscribes</b> a vineyard and renders it forbidden.
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> if it were <b>saffron</b> that grew in the vineyard, it <b>is useful</b> for seasoning and other uses, and therefore it proscribes the vineyard. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>thorns, for what are they useful? Rabbi Ḥanina said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Eliezer?</b> It is <b>because in Arabia they maintain thorns in the fields for their camels.</b> Rabbi Eliezer holds that since thorns are maintained in one place, they are considered useful everywhere.
<b>Rabbi Levi says:</b> An act of <b>acquisition may be performed</b> in order to effect acquisition of property <b>from a person on his deathbed even on Shabbat,</b> even though transactions are not performed on Shabbat. <b>And</b> this, that an act of acquisition must be performed, is <b>not</b> stated in order <b>to take into consideration the statement of Rabbi Eliezer</b> that the gifts of any person on his deathbed require an act of acquisition. <b>Rather,</b> the reason for this is that if a person on his deathbed requests the performance of an act of acquisition, his request is fulfilled, <b>lest</b> his anxiety upon seeing that his will is not being carried out cause him to <b>lose control of his mind</b> due to his grief, exacerbating his poor physical state.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>Rabbi Eliezer says: On Shabbat, the</b> verbal <b>statement</b> of a person on his deathbed <b>stands, as</b> he <b>cannot write,</b> and the Sages instituted that he can effect the transaction verbally lest the inability to do so exacerbate his condition. <b>But</b> a verbal instruction does <b>not</b> stand if stated <b>on a weekday. Rabbi Yehoshua says: With regard to Shabbat,</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> that his verbal instruction is sufficient, even though writing is prohibited. One can infer <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that the same applies <b>with regard to a weekday,</b> when writing is permitted.
<b>Similarly, one can acquire</b> property <b>on behalf of a minor, but one cannot acquire</b> property <b>on behalf of an adult,</b> since he can perform the act of acquisition himself; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The Sages <b>stated</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a minor,</b> and one may infer <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that this also applies <b>with regard to an adult,</b> who is able to perform the act of acquisition himself.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>Whose</b> opinion is ex-pressed in the <b>mishna?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>This is</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda.</b> This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Rabbi Meir says</b> that <b>Rabbi Eliezer says:</b> With regard to a person on his deathbed who distributes his property by verbal instruction, <b>on a weekday, his statements stand, because he can write, but</b> his statement does <b>not</b> stand <b>on Shabbat,</b> because he cannot write.
<b>Rabbi Yehoshua</b>

Daf 157a

<b>says: With regard to weekdays</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> that the verbal instruction of person on his deathbed is valid, even though it is permitted to write. <b>And</b> one may infer <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that the same applies <b>with regard to Shabbat,</b> when writing is prohibited. <b>Similarly, one can acquire</b> property <b>on behalf of an adult,</b> as he is able to effect acquisition himself, <b>but one cannot acquire</b> property <b>on behalf of a minor;</b> this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua says:</b> The Sages <b>stated</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to an adult,</b> even though he can effect acquisition himself. One may infer <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that this also applies <b>with regard to a minor,</b> who cannot effect acquisition himself.
<b>Rabbi Yehuda says that Rabbi Eliezer says: On Shabbat,</b> the verbal <b>statement of</b> a person on his deathbed <b>stands due to</b> the fact <b>that he cannot write. But</b> a verbal instruction does <b>not stand on a weekday. Rabbi Yehoshua says: With regard to Shabbat</b> the Sages <b>stated</b> that his verbal instruction stands, even though writing is prohibited. One may infer <b><i>a fortiori</i></b> that the same applies <b>with regard to a weekday,</b> when writing is permitted. <b>Similarly, one can acquire</b> property <b>on behalf of a minor, but one cannot acquire</b> property <b>on behalf of an adult,</b> since he can effect the acquisition himself; this is <b>the statement of Rabbi Eliezer.

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>A house collapsed on</b> a son <b>and upon his father, or upon</b> a certain person <b>and upon those</b> from <b>whom he stands to inherit,</b> and it is unknown who died first. If the son <b>bore</b> the responsibility to pay the <b>marriage contract of</b> his <b>wife and</b> to pay <b>a creditor,</b> and the son had no money with which to pay them except that which he might inherit from his father, and <b>the father’s heirs say: The son died first and afterward the father died,</b> and therefore the son did not inherit property from his father, <b>and the creditors say: The father died first and afterward the son died,</b> resulting in the son’s inheriting his father’s property, enabling the creditors to collect payment from the property even after the son’s death, there is a dispute with regard to how to rule.
Since it cannot be determined who died first, <b>Beit Shammai say: They divide</b> the property between them so that the father’s heirs receive half of his property and the son’s creditors receive the other half. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The <b>property</b> retains <b>its</b> previous ownership <b>status.</b> Since the last known owner of the property was the father, the property is given to the father’s heirs.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (175a): <b>One who lends</b> money <b>to another with</b> a promissory <b>note can collect</b> the debt even <b>from liened property</b> that has been sold. If one lends money only <b>with witnesses, he can collect</b> the debt only <b>from unsold property.</b>
<b>Shmuel raises a dilemma:</b> If the borrower wrote in the promissory note: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> in the future shall be liened to this debt, <b>and he</b> subsequently <b>acquired</b> property, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is the property liened or not? The Gemara clarifies the dilemma: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can transfer</b> ownership of <b>an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world, you should not raise the dilemma, as</b> the lender <b>certainly acquires,</b> i.e., places a lien, on the property. <b>Rather, when should you raise the dilemma?</b> Raise it <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of the Rabbis, who say: A person cannot transfer</b> ownership of <b>an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world.</b>
<b>Rav Yosef said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a mishna (<i>Ketubot</i> 110a): If one produces a promissory note against another, and the borrower produced a bill of sale dated after the promissory note that states that the lender sold him a field of his, Admon says that the borrower can say: Were I really indebted to you, you should have collected the loan when you sold me the field. <b>And the Rabbis say:</b> This does not prove anything. It is possible that <b>this</b> lender <b>was perspicacious, as he sold</b> the borrower <b>the land</b> for a good reason, <b>because</b> now <b>he can take</b> the field <b>as collateral from him</b> in lieu of the outstanding loan. This mishna indicates that even property acquired by the borrower after the promissory note is written is liened.
<b>Rava said to</b> Rav Yosef: <b>Do</b> you <b>speak</b> of a case where the debt is collected <b>from</b> the debtor? With regard to collecting the debt <b>from him,</b> the debt is collected from any property currently in his possession, <b>even from</b> the <b>cloak that is upon his shoulders. When the dilemma was raised to us,</b> it was with regard to a case where the borrower wrote: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he subsequently <b>acquired</b> property <b>and sold</b> it to others. The dilemma also pertains to a case where the borrower wrote: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he subsequently <b>acquired</b> property <b>and bequeathed</b> it to his heirs. In these cases, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Can the lender repossess the property from the buyer or heir?
<b>Rav Ḥana said: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from the mishna: In a case where <b>the house collapsed on</b> a son <b>and upon his father, or upon</b> a certain person <b>and upon those</b> from <b>whom he stands to inherit,</b> and it is unknown who died first, the <i>halakha</i> depends on the circumstances. If the son <b>bore</b> the responsibility to pay the <b>marriage contract of</b> his <b>wife and</b> to pay <b>a creditor,</b> and the son had no money with which to pay them except that which he might inherit from his father, and <b>the father’s heirs say: The son died first and afterward the father died,</b> and therefore the son did not inherit property from his father, <b>and the creditors say: The father died first</b> and afterward the son died, there is a dispute with regard to how to rule. In this case, the creditors claim that the son inherited his father’s property, and therefore they have a lien upon the property.
The Gemara explains: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that when the borrower writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he <b>acquires</b> property <b>and sells</b> it to others, it is not liened, and that when he writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he <b>acquires</b> property <b>and bequeaths</b> it to his heirs, <b>it is not liened,</b> then the mishna is difficult. <b>Although the father indeed died first,</b> this case <b>is</b> comparable to one where the borrower writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, as the son acquired the property after receiving the loan. This indicates that a lien can be placed upon property that one will acquire in the future.
<b>Rav Naḥman said to</b> the Sages: Rabbi <b>Zeira, our colleague, interpreted</b> the mishna as follows: In this case, the creditors do not claim the property because it is liened. Rather, they claim it because it is <b>a mitzva</b> incumbent <b>upon the orphans to repay their father’s debt. Rav Ashi objects to this:</b> If the promissory note does not place a lien on the property, <b>this is</b> considered <b>a loan by oral</b> agreement, <b>and Rav and Shmuel both say: A loan by oral</b> agreement <b>cannot be collected, neither from the heirs nor from the buyers.</b>

Daf 157b

<b>Rather,</b> in accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? This mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can transfer</b> ownership of <b>an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world.</b> Similarly, Rabbi Meir maintains that one can place a lien on property that the borrower will subsequently acquire.
<b>Rav Yaakov from Nehar Pekod says in the name of Ravina: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a mishna (<i>Shevi’it</i> 10:5): <b>Promissory notes that are antedated,</b> i.e., that are dated prior to the date on which the loan actually was given, <b>are invalid.</b> This is because the promissory note places a lien on the borrower’s property. By dating the document earlier than the loan itself, the lender appears to have a lien on property that the borrower sold prior to taking out the loan, enabling the lender to fraudulently repossess it from the buyer. <b>But</b> promissory notes <b>that are postdated are valid,</b> as this does not enable the lender to defraud a buyer.
The Gemara explains: <b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that property that the borrower acquires after receiving the loan <b>is not liened</b> even when he writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he <b>acquires</b> property <b>and sells</b> it to others, or when he writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he <b>acquires</b> property <b>and bequeaths</b> it to his heirs, <b>why,</b> then, <b>are postdated</b> promissory notes <b>valid?</b> They should be invalid, as in some instances they enable the creditor to fraudulently repossess property that is not liened, e.g., if the borrower acquires property after receiving the loan but before the date on the promissory note, and he sells it after that date. This case <b>is</b> comparable to one where the borrower writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened.
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? This mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can transfer</b> ownership of <b>an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world.</b>
<b>Rav Mesharshiyya says in the name of Rava: Come</b> and <b>hear</b> proof from a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to collecting a debt <b>in</b> a case of <b>enhancement of land, how</b> does it happen that the debt cannot be collected from liened property that has been sold? This question arises in a case <b>where</b> a debtor <b>sold a field to another and</b> the buyer <b>enhanced it, and a creditor came and repossessed it</b> from the buyer. <b>When</b> the buyer <b>collects</b> the value of the land from the seller, he <b>collects the principal</b> even <b>from liened property</b> that was sold to others, <b>but</b> he collects the value of <b>the enhancement</b> only <b>from unsold property.</b>
<b>And if it enters your mind</b> to say that property that the borrower acquires after receiving the loan <b>is not liened</b> even when he writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he <b>acquires</b> property <b>and sells</b> it to others, or when he writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he <b>acquires</b> property <b>and bequeaths</b> it to his heirs, <b>why does</b> the <b>creditor collect</b> his debt by repossessing the <b>enhancement</b> from the buyer? Since the enhancement was not extant at the time of the loan, it is not liened.
The Gemara answers: In accordance with <b>whose</b> opinion <b>is this</b> mishna? This mishna <b>is</b> in accordance with the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: A person can transfer</b> ownership of <b>an entity that has not</b> yet <b>come into the world.</b> The dilemma of Shmuel is raised according to the opinion of the Rabbis.
The Gemara comments: <b>If you say</b> that when the borrower writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he <b>acquires</b> property <b>and sells</b> it to others, it is not liened, and that when he writes: The property <b>that I will acquire</b> shall be liened, and he <b>acquires</b> property <b>and bequeaths</b> it to his heirs, <b>it is not liened,</b> then <b>it is not liened</b> and the following question will not arise. <b>If you say</b> that <b>it is liened, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to one who <b>borrowed</b> money from one lender <b>and</b> then <b>borrowed</b> money from another lender, stating in both cases that the property that he will acquire shall be liened, <b>and</b> he <b>then acquired</b> land? Does <b>the first</b> lender <b>have a lien upon</b> the property <b>or</b> does <b>the last</b> lender <b>have a lien upon</b> the property?
<b>Rav Naḥman said: This matter was raised before us, and</b> the Sages <b>sent</b> a response <b>from there,</b> from Eretz Yisrael: <b>The first</b> lender <b>acquires</b> the property, since his lien came first. <b>Rav Huna says:</b> The lenders <b>divide</b> the property between them. <b>And so teaches Rabba bar Avuh:</b> The lenders <b>divide</b> the property between them. <b>Ravina said: The first time Rav Ashi</b> taught this matter <b>he said to us: The first</b> lender <b>acquires</b> the property. <b>The last time Rav Ashi</b> taught this matter <b>he said to us:</b> The lenders <b>divide</b> the property between them. <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>they divide</b> the property between them.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from the aforementioned <i>baraita</i>: With regard to collecting a debt <b>in</b> a case of <b>enhancement of land, how</b> does it occur that the debt cannot be collected from liened property that has been sold? This question arises in a case <b>where</b> one <b>sold a field to another, and</b> the buyer <b>enhanced it, and a creditor came and repossessed it</b> from the buyer. <b>When</b> the buyer <b>collects</b> the value of the land from the seller, he <b>collects the principal</b> even <b>from liened property</b> that was sold to others, <b>but</b> he collects the value of <b>the enhancement</b> only <b>from unsold property. And if it is so</b> that in general, the property is divided between the creditors, then, since both the creditor and the buyer have a lien upon the enhancement of the property, the buyer <b>should</b> collect only <b>half of</b> the value of <b>the enhancement.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>What</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean, <b>as well,</b> when <b>it teaches</b> that the buyer <b>collects</b> the enhancement? The <i>baraita</i> means that he collects <b>half of</b> the value of <b>the enhancement.</b>

Daf 158a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>the house collapsed upon</b> a husband <b>and upon his wife,</b> and it is unknown who died first, if the wife did not have any children from her husband, then the following claims arise: <b>The husband’s heirs say:</b> The <b>wife died first</b> and was inherited by her husband, <b>and afterward the husband died,</b> and therefore the husband’s heirs inherit both his and her property. The <b>wife’s heirs say:</b> The <b>husband died first and afterward</b> the <b>wife died,</b> and her heirs inherit the property that she brought with her to the marriage and the payment of her marriage contract.
<b>Beit Shammai say: They divide</b> the property under dispute between them. <b>And Beit Hillel say:</b> The guaranteed <b>property</b> that the wife brought with her to the marriage retains <b>its</b> previous ownership <b>status.</b> The sum of the <b>marriage contract</b> remains <b>in the possession of the husband’s heirs,</b> since the marriage contract is collected from the husband’s property. <b>Property that is brought into and taken out</b> of the marriage <b>with her,</b> i.e., usufruct property that remains in the wife’s possession during her marriage, remains <b>in the possession of the heirs of the</b> woman’s <b>father.</b>

Daf 158b

<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches that according to Beit Hillel, the guaranteed property that the wife brought with her to the marriage retains its previous ownership status. The Gemara asks: <b>In whose possession</b> does the guaranteed property remain? <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> It remains <b>in the possession of the husband’s heirs,</b> since the husband is liable to compensate his wife for guaranteed property in the event of loss. <b>And Rabbi Elazar says:</b> It remains <b>in the possession of the wife’s heirs,</b> as the property came from her father’s house and belongs to her.
<b>And Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish says in the name of bar Kappara: They divide</b> the property between them. <b>And likewise bar Kappara teaches</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: <b>Since these</b> heirs <b>come to inherit and those</b> heirs <b>come to inherit,</b> and neither can prove his claim, <b>they divide</b> the property between them.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>the house collapsed on</b> a son <b>and upon his mother,</b> and it is unknown who died first, the following claims arise: The mother’s paternal family claims that the son died first, and therefore they inherit from the mother, and the son’s heirs claim that the mother died first and her son inherited from her, and therefore they inherit from the son. In this case, both <b>these</b> Sages <b>and those</b> Sages, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <b>concede that they divide</b> the property between them. <b>Rabbi Akiva said: In this</b> case <b>I concede that the property</b> retains <b>its</b> previous ownership <b>status. Ben Azzai said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>We are</b> already <b>troubled by</b> those cases where Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>are in disagreement. But</b> do <b>you come to bring upon us a disagreement</b> with regard to <b>the</b> case where they <b>agree?</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna states that according to Rabbi Akiva, the property retains its previous ownership status. The Gemara asks: <b>In whose possession</b> does the property remain? <b>Rabbi Ila says:</b> It remains <b>in the possession of the mother’s heirs. Rabbi Zeira,</b> when he was still in Babylonia, <b>said:</b> It remains <b>in the possession of the son’s heirs. When Rabbi Zeira ascended</b> to Eretz Yisrael, <b>he adopted the opinion of Rabbi Ila,</b> whereas <b>Rabba,</b> in Babylonia, <b>adopted the opinion</b> stated <b>by Rabbi Zeira. Rabbi Zeira said: Conclude from</b> this incident <b>that the air of Eretz Yisrael makes</b> one <b>wise,</b> as when I ascended to Eretz Yisrael I accepted the opinion of Rabbi Ila, who was also from Eretz Yisrael, whereas Rabba, who remained in Babylonia, accepted my former opinion.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that the property remains in the possession of the mother’s heirs? <b>Abaye says: Since the inheritance was</b> initially <b>in the possession of that tribe</b> of the mother, it is not removed from their possession in order to transfer it to the son’s heirs, who are from a different tribe.
The mishna teaches: <b>Ben Azzai said to</b> Rabbi Akiva: <b>We are</b> already <b>troubled by</b> those cases where Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel <b>are in disagreement.</b> But do you come to bring upon us a disagreement with regard to the case where they agree? <b>Rabbi Shamlai said: That is to say</b> that <b>ben Azzai was a disciple-colleague of Rabbi Akiva</b> and not just a disciple, <b>since he said to him:</b> Do <b>you come,</b> in the second person, rather than using the more formal third person.
§ The Sages <b>sent</b> a ruling <b>from there,</b> Eretz Yisrael: With regard to <b>a son who borrowed</b> money based <b>on</b> the security of <b>his father’s property during his father’s lifetime, and</b> whose father subsequently <b>died, his son repossesses</b> the property <b>from the buyers. And this is the</b> most <b>difficult</b> <i>halakha</i> to understand <b>with regard to monetary law.</b> The Gemara clarifies the ruling: If the son <b>borrowed, what does he repossess?</b> He needs to repay a debt, not to collect payment. <b>Moreover, what is the relevance of the buyers</b> in this matter? There is no mention of them in the premise. <b>Rather, if</b> this matter <b>was stated,</b> it is in <b>this</b> manner

Daf 159a

that <b>it was stated:</b> With regard to <b>a son who sold</b> some <b>of his father’s property during his father’s lifetime, and</b> the son <b>died,</b> the son’s <b>son repossesses</b> the property <b>from the buyers. And this is a difficult</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to monetary law,</b> as the buyers <b>can say to</b> the son’s son: Does <b>your father sell</b> the property to us <b>and you repossess</b> it?
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the difficulty? Perhaps he can say: I come</b> to repossess the property <b>on the basis of</b> the right of my <b>father’s father</b> to the property, as I inherit directly from him. <b>Know</b> that this is so, <b>as it is written: “In the place of your fathers shall be your sons; you shall make them into princes throughout the land”</b> (Psalms 45:17). The phrase “In the place of your fathers shall be your sons” indicates that a grandson inherits from his grandfather directly, and he does not inherit through his father.
<b>Rather, if</b> there is a <i>halakha</i> with regard to monetary law that poses <b>a difficulty, this is the difficult</b> <i>halakha</i>: With regard to <b>a firstborn son who sold, during his father’s lifetime,</b> the <b>portion of the firstborn</b> that he was set to inherit, <b>and</b> he <b>died in his father’s lifetime, his son can repossess</b> the portion of the firstborn <b>from the buyers. And this is a difficult</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to monetary law,</b> as <b>his father sells</b> the property and <b>he repossesses</b> it. <b>And if you would say: Here too, he says: I come</b> to repossess the property <b>on the basis of</b> the right of my <b>father’s father</b> to the property, this is not a valid claim, as, <b>if he comes</b> to repossess the property <b>on the basis of</b> the right of his <b>father’s father, what is the relevance of</b> the <b>portion of the firstborn,</b> since he is not his grandfather’s firstborn?
The Gemara rejects this: <b>And what is the difficulty? Perhaps he can say: I come</b> to repossess the property <b>on the basis of</b> the right of my <b>father’s father</b> to the property, <b>and</b> yet I receive the portion of the firstborn, as <b>I stand in</b> my <b>father’s stead.</b>
<b>Rather, if</b> there is a <i>halakha</i> with regard to monetary law that poses <b>a difficulty, this is the difficult</b> <i>halakha</i>: One <b>knew testimony supporting</b> another, and his testimony was written <b>in a document before he became a robber, and</b> then <b>he became a robber</b> and was disqualified from bearing witness. In this case, <b>he may not testify as to</b> the legitimacy of <b>his handwriting. But others may testify</b> that it is his handwriting on the document. The difficulty is that <b>now</b> that <b>his</b> testimony <b>is not deemed credible,</b> although he knows of the matter with certainty, is it logical that <b>others are deemed credible</b> and his signature is ratified according to their testimony? <b>And this is a difficult</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to monetary law.</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>What is the difficulty? Perhaps</b> this <i>halakha</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the signature <b>was</b> already <b>presumed by</b> the <b>court</b> to be <b>his handwriting</b> before he was disqualified, and the witnesses testify merely that the document was already ratified.
<b>Rather, if</b> there is a <i>halakha</i> with regard to monetary law that poses <b>a difficulty, this is the difficult</b> <i>halakha</i>: One <b>knew testimony supporting</b> another concerning the latter’s ownership of a plot of land, and his testimony was written <b>in a document before</b> the land <b>came into</b> the witness’s possession <b>as an inheritance,</b> which caused the witness to become an interested party. In this case, the witness <b>may not ratify his handwriting. But others may ratify his handwriting.</b> The Gemara rejects this: <b>And what is the difficulty? Perhaps here too,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the signature <b>was</b> already <b>presumed by</b> the <b>court</b> to be <b>his handwriting</b> before he became an interested party, and the witnesses testify merely that the document was already ratified.
<b>Rather, if</b> there is a <i>halakha</i> with regard to monetary law that poses <b>a difficulty, this is the difficult</b> <i>halakha</i>: One <b>knew testimony with regard to</b> another, and his testimony was written in a document <b>before he became</b> that person’s <b>son-in-law, and</b> then <b>he became his son-in-law.</b> In this case, the son-in-law <b>may not testify as to his handwriting,</b> since one cannot bear witness for his relative. <b>But others may testify</b> that it is his handwriting. Is it logical that <b>his</b> testimony <b>is not deemed credible,</b> yet <b>others are deemed credible</b> and may ratify his signature?
<b>And if you would say: Here too,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is referring to a case <b>where</b> the signature <b>was</b> already <b>presumed by</b> the <b>court</b> to be <b>his handwriting</b> before he became a relative, this is difficult. <b>But doesn’t Rav Yosef bar Minyumi say</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman says:</b> Others may testify as to the validity of his handwriting <b>even though</b> the signature <b>was not</b> previously <b>presumed by</b> the <b>court</b> to be <b>his handwriting?</b>
The Gemara rejects this: <b>And what is the difficulty? Perhaps it is the King’s edict,</b> i.e., a divine decree, <b>that</b> the testimony of a son-in-law <b>is not deemed credible, and</b> yet the testimony of <b>others is deemed credible, and</b> the reason he is disqualified is <b>not that he is</b> suspected of <b>lying.</b> This must be so, <b>as if you do not say so,</b> why are <b>Moses and Aaron</b> disqualified from bearing witness <b>for their father-in-law?</b> Could this be <b>because their</b> testimony <b>is not deemed credible? Rather, it is the King’s edict that</b> even Moses and Aaron <b>shall not bear witness for</b> their relatives. <b>Here too, it is the King’s edict that</b> a son-in-law <b>shall not testify as to</b> the validity of <b>his handwriting for his father-in-law.</b>
<b>Rather,</b> the difficulty is <b>actually as we said initially,</b> with regard to the <i>halakha</i> that if a son sold some of his father’s property and then died, the son’s son repossesses the property from the buyers. <b>And</b> with regard to the verse <b>that</b> posed <b>a difficulty for you: “In the place of your fathers shall be your sons”</b> (Psalms 45:17), which apparently indicates that a grandson inherits from his grandfather directly, this is not difficult. <b>That</b> verse <b>is written as a blessing.</b> The verse does not indicate the halakhic status of the grandson’s inheritance, and the reason he can repossess the property is still difficult.
The Gemara asks: <b>But can you say</b> that the verse <b>is written as a blessing,</b>

Daf 159b

<b>but with regard to the <i>halakha</i></b> it does <b>not</b> indicate anything?
<b>But isn’t it taught</b> in the mishna (157a): <b>A house collapsed on</b> a son <b>and upon his father, or upon</b> a certain person <b>and upon those</b> from <b>whom he stands to inherit,</b> and it is unknown who died first. If the son <b>bore</b> the responsibility to pay the <b>marriage contract of</b> his <b>wife and</b> to pay <b>a creditor,</b> and the son had no money with which to pay them except that which he might inherit from his father, and <b>the father’s heirs say: The son died first and afterward the father died,</b> and therefore the son did not inherit property from his father, <b>and the creditor says: The father died first and afterward the son died,</b> there is a dispute as to the <i>halakha</i>. The son therefore inherited his father’s property, and his creditor has a lien upon the property, enabling him to collect payment from the property even after the son’s death.
<b>What, is it not</b> correct to explain that <b>the father’s heirs</b> are the son’s <b>sons,</b> and the term: <b>Those</b> from <b>whom he stands to inherit,</b> is referring to the deceased son’s <b>brothers? And if it enters your mind</b> to maintain that the grandson <b>cannot say: I come</b> to repossess the property <b>on the basis of</b> the right of my <b>father’s father</b> to the property, <b>as when it is written</b> in the verse in Psalms: <b>“In the place of your fathers shall be your sons,”</b> this <b>is written as a blessing,</b> then the mishna is difficult. According to this understanding, grandsons inherit from their grandfather only through their father. If so, even <b>if the son died</b> first <b>and afterward the father died, what of it? Let the creditor say to</b> the son’s sons: It is <b>their father’s inheritance</b> that <b>I am taking,</b> as the grandsons inherit from their grandfather only through their father.
The Gemara rejects this explanation: <b>No, the father’s heirs are</b> the deceased son’s <b>brothers,</b> who certainly inherit from their father directly, and the term: <b>Those</b> from <b>whom he stands to inherit,</b> is referring to the deceased son’s <b>father’s brothers.</b> Therefore, one cannot derive from the mishna that a grandson inherits from his grandfather directly.
§ The Sages <b>raised a dilemma before Rav Sheshet: What is</b> the <i>halakha</i> <b>with regard to a son inheriting from his mother</b> while he is <b>in the grave, in order to bequeath</b> that inheritance <b>to his paternal brothers?</b> If a son dies, and afterward his mother dies, does the deceased son inherit from his mother, and subsequently bequeath the inheritance to his paternal brothers, who are not related to the mother? <b>Rav Sheshet said to them: You learned it</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Consider <b>the</b> case of a <b>father who was taken captive</b> and died in captivity, <b>and his son died in the province,</b> i.e., at home, <b>and</b> consider the case of <b>a son who was taken captive</b> and died, <b>and his father died in the province.</b> Since it is not known who died first, <b>the father’s heirs and the son’s heirs divide</b> the inheritance.
The Gemara asks: <b>What are the circumstances</b> of the case? <b>If we say</b> that the case <b>is as</b> the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches,</b> the <i>baraita</i> is difficult. <b>Who are the father’s heirs and who are the son’s heirs?</b> The same individuals inherit from both of them. <b>Rather, is it not</b> so that <b>this</b> is what the <i>baraita</i> <b>is saying:</b> Consider the case of <b>a father who was taken captive</b> and died in captivity, <b>and his daughter’s son died in the province, and</b> consider the case of the <b>son of his daughter who was taken captive</b> and died, <b>and the father of</b> the captive’s <b>mother died in the province, and we do not know which of them died first.</b> If the father died first, his daughter’s son inherits from him, and the son’s paternal relatives subsequently inherit from the son. If the son died first, the father’s heirs inherit the father’s estate. Since it is unknown which of them died first, <b>the father’s heirs and the son’s heirs divide</b> the inheritance.
<b>And if it is so</b> that a son inherits from his mother while in the grave, <b>although the son indeed died first, he should inherit</b> from <b>his mother’s father</b> while <b>in his grave and bequeath</b> his inheritance <b>to his paternal brothers,</b> and the son’s heirs should receive the entire inheritance. <b>Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that <b>the son does not inherit from his mother</b> while <b>in the grave in order to bequeath</b> that inheritance <b>to his paternal brothers?</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Minyumi said to Abaye: We learn</b> this <i>halakha</i> in the mishna (158b) <b>as well:</b> If <b>the house collapsed on</b> a son <b>and upon his mother,</b> both <b>these</b> Sages <b>and those</b> Sages, Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel, <b>concede that</b> the son’s heirs and the mother’s heirs <b>divide</b> the property between them. <b>And if it is so</b> that a son inherits from his mother while in the grave, <b>although</b> the <b>son indeed died first, he should inherit</b> from <b>his mother</b> while <b>in his grave and they should inherit</b> from him, i.e., he should bequeath his inheritance <b>to his paternal brothers. Rather, isn’t it</b> correct to <b>conclude from</b> that mishna that <b>the son does not inherit from his mother</b> while <b>in the grave in order to bequeath</b> that inheritance <b>to his paternal brothers?</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> the mishna that this is so.
<b>And what is the reason</b> that a son does not inherit from his mother while in the grave? <b>Abaye says:</b> The term <b>transfer,</b> concerning the transfer of inheritance from one tribe to another, <b>was stated with regard to</b> the inheritance of <b>a son</b> (see Numbers 36:7), <b>and</b> the term <b>transfer was stated with regard to</b> the inheritance of <b>a husband</b> (see 111b–113a and Numbers 36:9). <b>Just as</b> in the case categorized as <b>transfer that was stated with regard to</b> the inheritance of <b>a husband, the husband does not inherit</b> from <b>his wife</b> while he is <b>in the grave</b> in order to bequeath that inheritance to his heirs, <b>so too,</b> in the case categorized as <b>transfer that was stated with regard to</b> the inheritance of <b>a son, the son does not inherit from his mother</b> while <b>in the grave in order to bequeath</b> that inheritance <b>to his paternal brothers.</b>
§ There was <b>a certain</b> person <b>who said to another: I am selling to you</b> all of <b>the property</b> that I own <b>of bar Sisin. There was one</b> parcel of <b>land that was called</b> the tract <b>of the house of bar Sisin.</b> The seller <b>said to</b> the buyer: <b>This</b> latter parcel of land <b>is</b> actually <b>not</b> the property <b>of the house of bar Sisin, and it is</b> merely <b>called: Of the house of bar Sisin,</b> and therefore it is not included in the sale.
The matter <b>came before Rav Naḥman,</b> and <b>he placed</b> the land <b>in the possession of the buyer. Rava said to Rav Naḥman:</b> Is <b>this the <i>halakha</i>?</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant,</b> which in this case is the buyer. <b>And</b> the Gemara <b>raises a contradiction between</b> this statement <b>of Rava</b> and another statement <b>of Rava, and between</b> this statement <b>of Rav Naḥman</b> and another statement <b>of Rav Naḥman.</b>
The Gemara explains the contradictions. There was <b>a certain</b> man <b>who said to another: What do you want,</b> i.e., what are you doing, <b>with this house</b> of mine? <b>He said to</b> the claimant: <b>I purchased it from you and I</b> worked and <b>profited</b> from it for <b>the years</b> necessary for establishing the <b>presumption</b> of <b>ownership.</b> The claimant <b>said to him: I was</b> traveling <b>among the settlements</b> in a distant location, and I was unaware that you were residing in my house, which is why I did not lodge a protest.
The one residing in the house <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> for a judgment. Rav Naḥman <b>said to him: Go clarify your profiting,</b> i.e., prove that you really resided there for three years, and then the case can be judged. <b>Rava said to</b> Rav Naḥman: Is <b>this the</b> correct <b>judgment?</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that <b>the burden of proof rests upon the claimant.</b> Therefore, the claimant should have to prove that the possessor did not reside in the house. The first statement <b>of Rava is difficult,</b> as it is contradicted <b>by</b> the second statement <b>of Rava, and</b> the first statement <b>of Rav Naḥman</b> is difficult, as it is contradicted <b>by</b> the second statement <b>of Rav Naḥman.</b> In the first case, Rav Naḥman ruled in favor of the buyer, and Rava ruled in favor of the seller, whereas in the second case their rulings were reversed.
The Gemara answers: The apparent contradiction <b>between</b> the first statement <b>of Rava</b> and the second statement <b>of Rava</b> is <b>not difficult. Here,</b> with regard to the property of bar Sisin, the <b>seller stands in</b> possession of <b>his property,</b> and the buyer claims the parcel of land from him. <b>There,</b> the <b>buyer stands in</b> possession of <b>his property,</b> since he dwells in the house, and the seller wishes to evict him.
The contradiction between one statement <b>of Rav Naḥman and</b> the other statement <b>of Rav Naḥman</b> is <b>not difficult as well,</b> because there, <b>since</b> the seller <b>said to him:</b> I am hereby selling you all of the property that I own <b>of the house of bar Sisin, and</b> this parcel of land is <b>called: Of the house of bar Sisin,</b> it is <b>incumbent on him to reveal that it</b> is <b>not of the house of bar Sisin. But here,</b> in the case where the claimant states that he had been in a distant location, it <b>should not be</b> considered as any case <b>other</b> than one <b>where</b> the possessor is <b>holding a document</b> as evidence that he purchased the house. <b>Wouldn’t we</b> then <b>say to him:</b> First <b>ratify your document, and</b> only then be <b>established</b> as the owner of the <b>property?</b> In this case as well, since his presumptive ownership is in place of a document, he needs to clarify the matter by means of witnesses.

Daf 160a

<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In <b>an ordinary document, its witnesses</b> are to sign <b>inside it,</b> i.e., on the written side of the paper. In a folded and <b>tied</b> document, <b>its witnesses</b> are to sign <b>on the back of it.</b>
With regard to <b>an ordinary</b> document <b>whose witnesses wrote</b> their signatures <b>on the back of it,</b> and <b>a tied</b> document <b>whose witnesses wrote</b> their signatures <b>inside of it, both of these</b> are <b>not valid. Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says: A tied</b> document <b>whose witnesses wrote</b> their signatures <b>inside of it</b> is <b>valid, because one can transform it into an ordinary</b> document by untying it. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Everything</b> is <b>in accordance with regional custom.</b>
<b>An ordinary document</b> is rendered valid <b>by</b> its having at least <b>two witnesses, and a tied</b> document is rendered valid <b>by</b> its having at least <b>three</b> witnesses. With regard to <b>an ordinary</b> document <b>in which a single witness wrote</b> his signature, <b>and a tied</b> document <b>in which</b> only <b>two witnesses wrote</b> their signatures, <b>they are both not valid.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? What biblical basis is there for the existence of these two types of documents? <b>Rabbi Ḥanina says: As the verse states: “They shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses”</b> (Jeremiah 32:44). When the verse states: <b>“They shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds,”</b>

Daf 160b

<b>this</b> is referring to <b>an ordinary</b> document. When the verse states: <b>“And seal them,” this</b> is referring to <b>a tied</b> document. The next phrase, “and call witnesses [<i>veha’ed edim</i>],” which more literally would be translated: And have witnesses bear witness, is interpreted as follows: <b>“And have bear witness [<i>veha’ed</i>],”</b> this indicates the need for <b>two</b> witnesses, as the term “witness [<i>ed</i>]” in the Torah generally refers to two witnesses. As to the word <b>“witnesses [<i>edim</i>],”</b> this additional term indicates the need for <b>three</b> witnesses. <b>How so?</b> How can the verse call for both two witnesses and three witnesses? Rabbi Ḥanina explains: <b>Two</b> witnesses are required <b>for an ordinary</b> document, and <b>three</b> are required <b>for a tied</b> document.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But I</b> can just as well <b>reverse</b> it, requiring two witnesses for a tied document and three for an ordinary one. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the tied document requires <b>more</b> to be done <b>with regard to its ties,</b> it stands to reason that it requires <b>more</b> to be done <b>with regard to its witnesses,</b> requiring three rather than two.
<b>Rafram says</b> that there is a different source for two kinds of documents, <b>from here: “So I took the deed of the purchase, that which was sealed, the terms and conditions, and that which was open”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11). When the verse states: <b>“So I took the deed of the purchase,” this</b> is referring to <b>an ordinary</b> document. When it states: <b>“That which was sealed,” this</b> is referring to <b>a tied</b> document. When it states: <b>“And that which was open,” this</b> is referring to the <b>ordinary,</b> unfolded part <b>of a tied</b> document.
Rafram continues: With regard to the phrase: <b>“The terms and conditions,” these are the matters that</b> distinguish <b>an ordinary</b> document <b>from a tied</b> one. <b>How so?</b> What are the details that differentiate the two types of documents? <b>This</b> one, the ordinary document, has <b>two witnesses, and that</b> one, the tied document, has <b>three witnesses.</b> And in <b>this</b> one, the ordinary document, <b>its witnesses</b> are signed <b>inside it,</b> on the front side, while in <b>that</b> one, the tied document, <b>its witnesses</b> are signed <b>on the back of it.</b>
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But I</b> can just as well <b>reverse</b> it, requiring two witnesses for a tied document and three for an ordinary one. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the tied document requires <b>more</b> to be done <b>with regard to its ties,</b> it stands to reason that it requires <b>more</b> to be done <b>with regard to its witnesses,</b> requiring three rather than two.
<b>Rami bar Yeḥezkel said</b> that there is a different source for two sets of <i>halakhot</i> for two types of documents <b>from here: “At the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall a matter be established”</b> (Deuteronomy 19:15). <b>If</b> witnesses’ <b>testimony is established with two</b> witnesses, <b>why</b> did the verse <b>specify for you</b> that it is also established <b>with three,</b> which is self-evident? Rather, this verse serves <b>to tell you</b> that there is a requirement for <b>two</b> witnesses <b>for an ordinary</b> document, and a requirement for <b>three</b> witnesses <b>for a tied</b> document.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But I</b> can just as well <b>reverse</b> it, requiring two witnesses for a tied document and three for an ordinary one. The Gemara answers: <b>Since</b> the tied document requires <b>more</b> to be done <b>with regard to its ties,</b> it stands to reason that it requires <b>more</b> to be done <b>with regard to its witnesses,</b> requiring three rather than two.
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that <b>these</b> verses <b>are coming for this</b> purpose, to teach that there are two types of documents? But <b>each and every one</b> of them <b>comes for its</b> own <b>purpose.</b> The first verse comes <b>for that which is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: When the verse states: <b>“They shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them,</b> and call witnesses” (Jeremiah 32:44), it is merely to <b>teach us good advice,</b> that people should carefully document their purchases in order to provide permanent proof of purchase. When the verse states: <b>“So I took the deed of the purchase”</b> (Jeremiah 32:11), <b>this was</b> merely how that <b>incident</b> occurred, and the phrase is not intended to teach any <i>halakhot</i>. When the verse states: <b>“At the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses</b> shall a matter be established” (Deuteronomy 19:15), this is stated in order <b>to juxtapose three</b> witnesses <b>with two</b> witnesses for several reasons, as delineated <b>in the dispute between Rabbi Akiva and the Rabbis</b> (<i>Makkot</i> 5b).
The Gemara explains: <b>Rather,</b> the entire institution of the <b>tied</b> document is <b>rabbinic</b> in origin, <b>and</b> all these <b>verses</b> that were cited above by various <i>amora’im</i> were intended as <b>mere support</b> for the concept of a tied document, as opposed to actual sources.
The Gemara asks: <b>And what is the reason</b> that <b>the Sages instituted</b> the <b>tied</b> document? The Gemara explains: There was <b>a place where there were</b> many <b>priests, and they were very quick tempered, and they would</b> seek to <b>divorce their wives</b> impetuously. The <i>halakha</i> is that a priest may not marry a divorcée, even his own ex-wife. These priests, who acted impetuously, often regretted having divorced their wives. <b>And</b> therefore, <b>the Sages instituted an ordinance</b> that the bill of divorce for these people should be of the tied format, which is a long, drawn-out process, hoping that <b>meanwhile, their composure would be regained</b> and they would reconsider their decision to divorce.
The Gemara asks: This <b>works out well</b> for <b>bills of divorce,</b> but <b>what can be said</b> with regard to other <b>documents?</b> Why is this procedure used for other documents as well? The Gemara answers: This was instituted <b>so that you should not differentiate between bills of divorce and</b> other <b>documents.</b>
§ <b>Where do the witnesses sign</b> on a tied document? <b>Rav Huna says:</b> They sign <b>between each tied</b> fold. <b>And Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says:</b> They sign <b>on the back of the written</b> side, taking care that the signatures are exactly <b>opposite the writing, on the outside.</b>
<b>Rami bar Ḥama said to Rav Ḥisda: According to Rav Huna, who says</b> that the witnesses sign <b>between each tied</b> fold, it <b>enters our mind</b> that he meant <b>between each tied</b> fold <b>on the inside</b> of the document. <b>But</b> this is difficult, as there was <b>a certain tied</b> document <b>that came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, not realizing it was tied, <b>said: There is no date on this</b> document, so it is not valid. Then, <b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>said to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Perhaps</b> the date is <b>hidden between the tied</b> folds. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>opened it and saw</b> that the date was in fact between the tied folds. <b>And if it is so</b> that the witnesses sign between each tied fold on the inside of the document, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>should have</b> had two objections, and said: <b>There is no date on this</b> document, <b>and there are</b> also <b>no witnesses</b> signed <b>on this</b> document.
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: Do you maintain</b> that Rav Huna meant that the witnesses sign <b>between the tied</b> folds <b>on the inside? No,</b> he meant <b>between the tied</b> folds <b>on the outside</b> of the document.
The Gemara questions Rav Huna’s opinion: <b>But let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the party holding the document <b>falsified</b> some information <b>and wrote whatever he wanted. And</b> this is a concern, as there are already <b>witnesses signed</b> on the document. In an ordinary document the witnesses sign immediately following the text, so there is no possibility of adding to the text. A tied document has part of its text written in the folds, but also has a part written on the face of the document on the unfolded paper, before or after the text in the folded part. If the witnesses sign between the folds there is the possibility of writing additional text in the unfolded section.
The Gemara explains: The case is one <b>where it is written in</b> the document: Everything is <b>confirmed and established.</b> That is, every folded document must contain this formula at the end of the text, to prevent forgery, as any writing after this formula would be disregarded.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the holder of the document <b>wrote whatever he wanted and afterward wrote another</b> time: Everything is <b>confirmed and established.</b> The Gemara explains: <b>We write</b> only <b>one</b> declaration of: Everything is <b>confirmed and established; we do not write two</b> declarations of: Everything is <b>confirmed and established.</b> Therefore, anything written after the first declaration would be rejected, even if followed by a repetition of the declaration.
The Gemara questions further: <b>But let</b> there be <b>a concern</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the holder of the document <b>erased</b> the declaration: Everything is <b>confirmed and established, and</b> then <b>wrote whatever he wanted</b> over the erasure, <b>and afterward wrote</b> the declaration: Everything is <b>confirmed and established.</b> The Gemara responds: How could this happen? <b>Doesn’t Rabbi Yoḥanan say:</b> A document that includes <b>a suspended</b> correction of text inserted between lines of the document, which is <b>verified</b> at the end of the document, <b>is valid;</b>

Daf 161a

but a document with a reference to words written over <b>an erasure is not valid, even if it is verified</b> at the end of the document. At the end of a document, before the formula: Everything is confirmed and established, is written, any corrections made in the document are verified by adding to the text: On line so-and-so, such and such a word has been added, or some similar formulation. This may be done only for inserted corrections, not for erasures.
The Gemara clarifies this statement: <b>And they said that an erasure</b> on a document renders the document <b>not valid only</b> if it is <b>in a place</b> on the document where the declaration: Everything is <b>confirmed and established,</b> should have been written, <b>and</b> only if the erasure <b>is the measure</b> of space in which the declaration: Everything is <b>confirmed and established,</b> can be written. The only concern with erasures is that the crucial formula: Everything is confirmed and established, might have been erased, as this would allow for unlimited forgery. If the erasure is such that this formula could not possibly have been erased, the document is valid.
§ Rami bar Ḥama asked Rav Ḥisda: <b>And according to Rav Yirmeya bar Abba, who says</b> that the witnesses sign <b>on the back of the written</b> side, taking care that the signatures are exactly <b>opposite the writing, on the outside let</b> there be <b>a concern</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the party holding the document <b>will write whatever he wants on the inside,</b> i.e., the front of the document, adding to the text, <b>and</b> then <b>have extra witnesses sign on the outside, and</b> he will <b>say</b> to anyone questioning the number of witnesses being more than the minimum: <b>I did</b> this in order <b>to increase</b> the number of <b>witnesses,</b> the more to publicize the matters written in the document.
Rav Ḥisda <b>said to him: Do you maintain</b> that the <b>witnesses sign in order,</b> that is, one under the other, starting from the top of the page on the back? This is not correct; rather, the <b>witnesses sign from bottom to top.</b> The witnesses sign in a perpendicular direction relative to the text of the document. The first signature begins at the reverse side of the last line of the document, and it continues upward toward the first line. There is therefore no possibility of adding to the text of the document, as, if the text extended beyond the beginning of the signatures, it would be recognized as a forgery.
Rami bar Ḥama continues to question the method of signature prescribed by Rav Yirmeya bar Abba: <b>But let</b> there be <b>a concern</b> that <b>perhaps something detrimental</b> to the holder of the document <b>happens</b> to appear <b>in the final line</b> of the document, <b>and he excises the final line, and</b> in doing so <b>excises</b> the first name of the witness on the opposite side as well. For instance, if the witness’s name is Reuven, son of Ya’akov, he will excise <b>Reuven along with</b> the final line of the document, <b>and</b> the document <b>will be rendered valid with</b> the remaining part of the signature: <b>“Son of Ya’akov, witness.” As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 87b): If one signs: <b>Son of so-and-so, witness,</b> without mentioning his own name, the document is <b>valid.</b>
The Gemara answers: It is a case <b>where it is written “Reuven, son of” on one line,</b> i.e., opposite the final line of the document, <b>and “Ya’akov, witness,” above it,</b> beginning from the penultimate line of the document and continuing upward in a perpendicular manner. That is, a tied document is valid only if the witnesses sign in this manner. In this case, if the final line of the document is excised, all that will remain of the signature will be: “Ya’akov, witness.”
Rami bar Ḥama continues to ask: <b>But let</b> there be <b>a concern</b> that <b>perhaps he will excise</b> the final line of the document, along with the words <b>“Reuven, son of,” and</b> the document <b>will be rendered valid with</b> the remaining part of the signature: <b>“Ya’akov, witness.” As we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 87b): If someone signs just: <b>So-and-so, witness,</b> the document is <b>valid.</b>
The Gemara answers: It is a case <b>where</b> the word <b>witness is not written</b> after the witnesses’ names. That is, a tied document is valid only if the word witness does not appear after the signatures. It is only in such a case that the document cannot be materially changed by excising the final line without rendering the witnesses’ names disqualified.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead <b>that actually</b> the witness <b>did write “witness”</b> after his signature, and the case is one <b>where we know</b> for a fact <b>that this signature,</b> which consists of the words “Ya’akov, witness,”

Daf 161b

<b>is not Yaakov’s</b> signature. That is, it is known for a fact that there is no one living in the city where the document was written who is named Ya’akov and whose signature matches the signature on this document. Therefore, the court will recognize that the signature must have originally stated: “So-and-so, son of Ya’akov, witness,” and that the last line had been excised, and they will invalidate it.
Rami bar Ḥama challenges: <b>But perhaps</b> this witness <b>signed using the name of his father</b> instead of his own name, as a gesture of respect toward his father. The Gemara answers: This is not done; <b>a person does not discard his own name and sign using</b> only <b>the name of his father.</b>
Rami bar Ḥama challenges further: <b>But perhaps</b> the witness <b>made</b> this name <b>into a mere distinguishing mark</b> that he uses as his signature, <b>as</b> it is known that <b>Rav</b> used to <b>draw a fish</b> as his signature mark, rather than signing his name, and <b>Rabbi Ḥanina</b> used to <b>draw a palm branch</b> as his signature mark, and <b>Rav Ḥisda</b> used to sign just the letter <b><i>samekh</i>,</b> and <b>Rav Hoshaya</b> used to sign just the letter <b><i>ayin</i>,</b> and <b>Rava bar Rav Huna</b> used to sign his name by drawing a ship’s <b>mast [<i>makhota</i>].</b> The Gemara answers: <b>A person is not</b> so <b>insolent</b> as <b>to use his father’s name as a distinguishing mark.</b>
<b>Mar Zutra said: Why do you need all this?</b> Why go to such lengths to answer the question posed above? There is a simpler answer: <b>Any tied</b> document <b>whose witnesses do not end on a single line</b> is <b>not valid.</b> The Gemara had previously assumed that the witnesses sign one after the other, beginning at the document’s bottom line and going upward toward the first line; this arrangement leaves open the possibility that the signature of the first witness could be truncated by an unscrupulous party. Mar Zutra explains that this is not so; rather, the signatures are written with each one beginning opposite the bottom line and heading upward toward the beginning of the document. Therefore, if a line of text is excised from the bottom of the document, the names of all the witnesses on the reverse side will be truncated, and the forgery will become apparent.
§ <b>Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> There are two <i>halakhot</i> with regard to documents: For <b>any erasures</b> in a document, the scribe <b>must write</b> at the end of the document: <b>And this is their verification.</b> That is, he must list the erasures, stating that on line so-and-so there is an erasure and a correction stating such and such, for each erasure. <b>And</b> the second <i>halakha</i> is that the scribe <b>must review</b> some <b>of the details of the document in the final line</b> of the document. <b>What is the reason</b> for this second requirement?

Daf 162a

<b>Rav Amram says:</b> It is <b>because</b> one <b>may not learn</b> any new details <b>from</b> the <b>final line</b> of a document. There is a concern that the holder of the document may have written in an extra line of text to his advantage, between the text and the witnesses’ signatures. Therefore, any new information contained in the last line is disregarded. Since the final line is disregarded, it is necessary that the final line of a document contain only a review of what is already written in it.
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Rav Amram: From where do you</b> know <b>this?</b> Rav Amram <b>said to him: As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:1): If one writing a document <b>distanced the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>two lines from the text</b> of the document, leaving two lines blank, the document is <b>not valid,</b> as it would be possible for the holder of the document to fill in false information in those lines. But if one distanced the signatures <b>one line</b> from the text, the document is <b>valid.</b>
Rav Amram analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What is different</b> in the case of <b>two</b> blank <b>lines</b> that that the document is not valid? If you say that <b>perhaps</b> the holder of the document will take advantage of those two blank lines, and <b>forge</b> unverified information <b>and write</b> it in those lines, then in the case of <b>one line</b> left blank <b>as well,</b> he can <b>forge</b> information <b>and write</b> it in that line. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from</b> the <i>baraita</i> that one <b>may not learn</b> any new details <b>from</b> the <b>final line</b> of a document? Therefore, only when two lines are left blank is there a concern that false information would be added to the penultimate line. The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> this <i>baraita</i> that it is so.

Daf 162b

<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: If the space of <b>a line and a half</b> is left blank, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? The Gemara seeks a solution to the dilemma. <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> what was stated in the <i>baraita</i> cited earlier: If one writing a document <b>distanced the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>two lines</b> from the text of the document, leaving two lines blank, the document is <b>not valid.</b> One can infer: <b>But</b> if there is a gap of only <b>a line and a half,</b> the document is <b>valid.</b>
The Gemara deflects this proof: <b>Say the last clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: If one writing a document distanced the witnesses’ signatures <b>one line</b> from the text of the document, the document is <b>valid.</b> One can infer: It is only when there is a gap of <b>one line that</b> the document <b>is valid, but</b> if there is a gap of <b>a line and a half</b> it is <b>not valid.</b> The Gemara states: <b>Rather, no</b> inference is <b>to be learned from this</b> <i>baraita</i>.
<b>What</b> halakhic conclusion <b>was</b> reached <b>about</b> this matter? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear</b> a proof from a different source, <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:10): If one writing a document <b>distanced the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>two lines from the text</b> of the document, the document is <b>not valid,</b> but if the gap is <b>less than that,</b> it is <b>valid.</b> It is clear from the <i>baraita</i> that any gap less than two full lines does not invalidate the document.
The <i>baraita</i> continues: If <b>there were four or five witnesses signed on the document, and one of them was found</b> to be <b>a relative</b> of one of the parties in the document, <b>or</b> one of them was found to be otherwise <b>disqualified</b> from bearing witness, the <b>testimony</b> on the document may be <b>established via the other</b> witnesses.
The Gemara draws a further conclusion from this <i>baraita</i>: This <b>supports</b> the opinion of <b>Ḥizkiyya, as Ḥizkiyya says:</b> If one <b>filled in</b> the gap between the document and the signatures <b>with</b> signatures of <b>relatives,</b> the document is <b>valid.</b>
Ḥizkiyya continued: <b>And do not be surprised</b> by this, <b>as</b> a similar situation is found with regard to the roofing of a <i>sukka</i>. Empty <b>space</b> in the roofing <b>of a <i>sukka</i> disqualifies</b> the <i>sukka</i> if the space extends for <b>three</b> handbreadths, whereas materials that are <b>unfit</b> to be used as <b>roofing disqualify</b> the <i>sukka</i> only if the unfit material extends for <b>four</b> handbreadths. If a <i>sukka</i> had a gap in its roofing of three handbreadths it is disqualified, but if the gap is filled in with unfit material the <i>sukka</i> is valid, since it is less than four handbreadths. This is comparable to the situation with a document: If there is a significant gap between the text and the signatures the document is not valid, but if the gap is filled in with signatures of those disqualified from bearing witness it is valid.
§ <b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: With regard to the gap of <b>two</b> blank <b>lines</b> between the text and the signatures, <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said</b> invalidates the document,

Daf 163a

does this refer to the size of lines <b>with the space</b> between lines added? <b>Or</b> is it <b>perhaps</b> referring to lines of writing themselves, <b>without their spaces?</b>
<b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said:</b> It <b>stands to reason that</b> it is referring to the lines <b>with their spaces. As, if</b> it were to <b>enter your mind</b> that it is referring to the lines <b>without their spaces, for what is one line without its space fit?</b> The <i>baraita</i> did not have to state that a document with a single blank line after the text, measured without counting spaces, is not forgeable; this is obvious. <b>Rather,</b> one may <b>conclude from</b> this claim that the reference is to two lines <b>with their spaces.</b> The Gemara affirms: <b>Conclude from</b> this claim that it is so.
<b>Rabbi Shabbtai says in the name of Ḥizkiyya:</b> With regard to the gap of <b>two</b> blank <b>lines</b> between the text and the signatures, <b>which</b> the Sages <b>said</b> invalidates the document, the lines are measured <b>by the handwriting of witnesses, and not</b> by <b>the handwriting of a scribe,</b> who is presumably skilled enough to write in a smaller script. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? <b>Anyone who forges</b> a document, adding additional lines to the document, <b>would not go to a scribe and</b> ask him to <b>forge</b> it; he would execute the forgery himself, or have another unscrupulous person who is not a professional scribe forge it. Therefore, in order to present a concern for possible forgery, a document must have two blank lines that are measured by the handwriting of an ordinary person, such as one of the witnesses.
The Gemara has established that the width of the gap required to invalidate the document is two lines with interlinear space. The Gemara clarifies: <b>And how much</b> interlinear space is necessary to invalidate the document? <b>Rav Yitzḥak ben Elazar says: For example,</b> enough to write the Hebrew word <b><i>lekh</i>, and</b> then the Hebrew word <b><i>lekha</i>, this</b> word <b>on top of that</b> one. These two words each consist of the two letters <i>lamed</i> and final <i>khaf</i>; the former has a projection that fully occupies the interlinear space above it, and the latter has a projection that fully occupies the interlinear space below it. Writing these words one under the other, then, would require an additional interlinear space above and below both lines. The Gemara concludes: <b>Apparently,</b> Rav Yitzḥak ben Elazar <b>maintains</b> that the empty space required to invalidate the document is the width of <b>two</b> written <b>lines with four</b> interlinear <b>spaces.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Ami states</b> a different opinion <b>in the name of Ulla: For example,</b> enough to write a <b><i>lamed</i> on</b> the <b>upper</b> line <b>and</b> a final <b><i>khaf</i> on</b> the <b>lower</b> line. The Gemara concludes: <b>Apparently,</b> Ulla <b>maintains</b> that the empty space required to invalidate the document is the width of <b>two</b> written <b>lines with three</b> interlinear <b>spaces,</b> one above the first line, one between the two lines, and one beneath the second line.
<b>Rabbi Abbahu states</b> a different opinion: <b>For example,</b> enough to write the name <b>Barukh ben Levi on one line.</b> Barukh contains a final <i>khaf</i>, and Levi contains a <i>lamed</i>. The Gemara concludes: <b>Apparently,</b> Rabbi Abbahu <b>maintains</b> that the empty space required to invalidate the document is the width of <b>one</b> written <b>line with two</b> interlinear <b>spaces,</b> one above the line and one beneath the line.
§ <b>Rav says: They taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that a gap of two lines invalidates the document <b>only</b> if that space is <b>between the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>and the text</b> of the document. <b>But</b> if there is a gap <b>between the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>and</b> a court’s <b>ratification</b> of the document, which follows the witnesses’ signatures, then <b>even</b> if there is <b>more</b> space than this, the document is <b>valid.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about the case where the gap is <b>between the witnesses and the text,</b> that it invalidates the document? There is a concern that <b>perhaps</b> the holder of the document <b>may forge</b> additional lines <b>and write whatever he wants, and the witnesses</b> have already <b>signed</b> at the bottom, giving the appearance that they attest to the added lines as well. But the same concern can be raised concerning a gap <b>between the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>and</b> the court’s <b>ratification as well:</b> There, too, he can <b>forge</b> additional lines <b>and write whatever he wants, and</b> have <b>witnesses sign it,</b> with the court’s ratification giving the appearance that it attests to the added lines and signatures as well. Why is this document valid?
The Gemara explains: When is a gap between the witnesses’ signatures and the court’s ratification not problematic, according to Rav? Only <b>when</b> someone <b>inks in</b> the blank space with lines or dots, to prevent information from being added there. The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the gap <b>between the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>and</b> the text of <b>the document</b> should <b>also</b> be made irrelevant in this manner: <b>Let</b> the scribe <b>ink in [<i>metayyet</i>]</b> the blank space. Why, then, was it taught categorically that the witnesses must sign within two lines of the text?
The Gemara answers: Inking in the gap between the text and the signatures of the witnesses will not help, as people might <b>say,</b> i.e., the concern might be raised: <b>The witnesses are signed</b> only <b>on the inking in.</b> It is possible that the witnesses’ signatures were affixed only to attest that the inking was done in their presence and that the inking in is not a sign of duplicity, and their signatures do not relate to the actual text of the document. The Gemara asks: If so, raise the same concern when the gap <b>between the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>and the</b> court’s <b>ratification</b> is inked in; there too, people might <b>say: The court’s</b> ratification <b>is signed</b> only <b>for the inking in,</b> and not for the actual text of the document. The Gemara answers: <b>A court does not sign on</b> mere <b>inking in;</b> their ratification is always in reference to the entire document.
The Gemara raises another issue: <b>And let</b> there be <b>a concern</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the holder of the document will <b>excise</b> the entire text that appears <b>above</b> the signatures, <b>and</b> then <b>erase the inked-in</b> part <b>and write whatever he wants</b> in that erased area, <b>and</b> have unscrupulous <b>witnesses sign</b> it. <b>And</b> this would be a valid document, as <b>Rav says: A document that comes</b> before the court for ratification in which <b>its</b> content <b>and</b> the signatures of <b>its witnesses are</b> both written <b>over an erasure</b> is <b>valid.</b> The court ratification would then be assumed to be referring to this new, forged document.

Daf 163b

<b>This works out well,</b> i.e., this concern does not apply, <b>according to Rav Kahana, who teaches in the name of Shmuel</b> that a document in which its content and its witnesses’ signatures are both written over an erasure is valid; according to him, all <b>is well.</b> It is Rav who says that an inked-in gap between the witnesses’ signatures and the court’s ratification is acceptable, and it is Shmuel who says that a document that is written and signed over an erasure is acceptable. <b>But according to Rav Tavyumei, who teaches</b> this latter statement <b>in the name of Rav, what can be said?</b> According to him, Rav said both statements, and taken together they pose a difficulty: The inked-in gap between the witnesses’ signatures and the ratification can easily be erased and a new document with signatures can be written over the erasure.
The Gemara answers: Rav <b>maintains</b> that in <b>all cases like this,</b> where a document and its witnesses’ signatures are written over an erasure and there is a court ratification on a non-erased part of the paper, the later court <b>ratifies</b> the document <b>not on the basis of the</b> previous court’s <b>ratification that is on it, but</b> only <b>on the basis of the</b> signatures of the <b>witnesses that are on it.</b> Therefore, the forging of a document in this manner is impossible, as the prior ratification of the court is disregarded, and the witnesses will attest to what they signed upon.
The Gemara cites another opinion: <b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that a gap of one line does not invalidate the document <b>only</b> in the case where that space is <b>between the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>and the text</b> of the document. <b>But</b> if the gap is <b>between the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>and</b> a court’s <b>ratification</b> of the document, then a space of <b>even one line</b> renders the document <b>not valid.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about the case where there is a one-line gap <b>between the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>and</b> the court’s <b>ratification</b> that you say it is not valid? The Gemara answers: There is a concern that <b>perhaps</b> the holder of the document will <b>excise</b> the entire text of the document at <b>the top</b> of the paper <b>and</b> then <b>write</b> a new, brief document, with <b>its</b> text <b>and</b> the signatures of <b>its witnesses on one line.</b> The court’s ratification will appear to verify the new, forged document. <b>And</b> Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds</b> that <b>a document that comes</b> before the court with <b>its</b> text <b>and</b> the signatures of <b>its witnesses</b> appearing <b>on one line is valid.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>If so,</b> the same problem <b>also</b> exists when there is a one-line gap <b>between the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>and the text:</b> There should be a concern that <b>perhaps</b> he will <b>excise</b> the entire text of the document at <b>the top</b> of the paper <b>and</b> then <b>write whatever he wants</b> in a brief, one-line document. <b>And the witnesses’</b> signatures on the next line, which are there from the old document, will still be <b>signed</b> there, appearing to attest to the veracity of the new, one-line document. The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>holds</b> that <b>a document that comes</b> before the court with <b>its</b> text <b>on one line and</b> the signatures of <b>its witnesses</b> appearing <b>on another line,</b> i.e., on the following line, is <b>not valid.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>And let</b> there be <b>a concern</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the holder of the document will excise the entire document, leaving only the blank line and the signatures that follow it, and he will <b>write</b> a brief document in which <b>its</b> text <b>and</b> the signatures of <b>its witnesses</b> are <b>on one line,</b> followed by the original signatures that remained from the original document, <b>and</b> he will <b>say: I did this</b> in order <b>to increase</b> the number of <b>witnesses,</b> the more to publicize the matter written in the document. The document is therefore still forgeable.
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>maintains</b> that in <b>all cases like this,</b> where a document and its witnesses’ signatures are written on one line, followed by other signatures on subsequent lines, the court <b>ratifies</b> the document <b>not on the basis of the</b> signatures of the <b>witnesses that</b> are <b>on the bottom, but on the basis of the</b> signatures of the <b>witnesses that</b> are <b>on top,</b> on the same line as the text. Therefore, the forging of a document in this manner is impossible. The false signatures of the witnesses will be discovered when those witnesses attest to what they signed upon.
§ Having cited Rav’s statement, the Gemara discusses <b>the</b> matter <b>itself. Rav says: A document that comes</b> before the court in which <b>its</b> content <b>and</b> the signatures of <b>its witnesses are</b> both written <b>over an erasure</b> is <b>valid.</b>

Daf 164a

<b>And if you say:</b> There is a possibility of forgery with such a document, as the holder of the document can <b>erase</b> the original writing on the paper, then write the text of the document and have witnesses sign on the part that had been erased, <b>then erase</b> the document text <b>once again,</b> substituting for it a text that is more to his advantage, leaving the original signatures in place, this is not a valid argument. Paper that has been <b>erased once is not similar</b> in appearance <b>to</b> paper that has been <b>erased twice.</b> It will be seen that the signatures are on a place that had been erased once and that the text is written on a place that had been erased twice, and the forgery will be noticed.
The Gemara suggests: <b>But let</b> there be <b>a concern</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the holder of the document will <b>initially,</b> after the entire original document, including the signatures, has been erased, but before the second one is written, <b>throw</b> some <b>ink on the place</b> where the <b>witnesses</b> are to sign under the text of the second document, <b>and</b> then <b>erase</b> that ink. He will do this <b>so that when,</b> after the witnesses have signed, <b>he then erases</b> the document text and writes a false text, it will emerge that both <b>this,</b> the new document’s text, <b>and that,</b> the signatures, will be on paper that had been <b>erased twice.</b>
<b>Abaye said</b> in response: <b>Rav holds</b> that <b>witnesses may not sign</b> a document written over <b>an erasure unless</b> the paper <b>was erased in their presence,</b> i.e., unless they saw the paper after its old text had been erased, before the new text was written. They will then see that the place where they are to sign has been erased twice, while the place where the document is to be written has been erased only once. They will realize that this leaves open an opportunity of subsequent erasing and falsification, and they will refrain from signing.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav from a <i>baraita</i>: A document in which <b>its</b> text is <b>on</b> a part of the <b>paper</b> that has never had writing erased <b>and</b> the signatures of <b>its witnesses</b> are <b>on an erasure</b> is <b>valid.</b> The Gemara suggests: <b>But let us be concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the holder of the document will <b>erase</b> the text <b>and write</b> in its place <b>whatever he wants, and it will</b> then <b>be</b> a document where both <b>its</b> text <b>and</b> the signatures of <b>its witnesses</b> are <b>on an erasure.</b> Since Rav maintains that such a document is valid, it is easily forgeable in this manner.
The Gemara answers: Such a document is valid only in a case <b>where</b> the witnesses <b>write this: We,</b> the <b>witnesses, signed on an erasure, but the document</b> text <b>was written on</b> a part of the <b>paper</b> that never had writing erased. If the holder of the document then tries to erase the original text and write new text in its place, the forgery will be noticed.
The Gemara asks: <b>Where</b> do the witnesses <b>write</b> this declaration? <b>If</b> they write it <b>underneath</b> their signatures, the holder of the document can simply <b>excise it.</b> And <b>if</b> they write it <b>above</b> their signatures, the holder of the document can <b>erase it</b> along with the text of the document. The Gemara answers: <b>They write</b> the declaration <b>between</b> the signature of one <b>witness and</b> the signature of the other <b>witness.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that the <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case in which the witnesses write a declaration about the circumstances of the document’s condition, <b>say the latter clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>: A document in which <b>its</b> text <b>is on an erasure and</b> the signatures of <b>its witnesses are on</b> a part of <b>the paper</b> that never had writing erased is <b>not valid.</b> The Gemara presents its question: <b>Why</b> is such a document <b>not valid? Here, too, let</b> the witnesses <b>write this: We,</b> the <b>witnesses, signed on paper</b> that never had writing erased, <b>but the document</b> text was written <b>on an erasure.</b>
<b>Now</b> in this case <b>as well</b> it should be valid, as <b>what</b> can <b>you say</b> to argue that it is a forgeable document? If you say that the holder of the document, having <b>erased</b> the original document, can <b>erase</b> the writing <b>once again</b> and write a new, false document, this is not a concern, as <b>didn’t you say</b> that paper that has been <b>erased once is not similar</b> in appearance <b>to</b> paper that has been <b>erased twice?</b> It would therefore be noticeable that the document had been erased a second time, and the forgery would be noticeable. The Gemara answers: <b>That statement</b> applies only <b>when the witnesses are signed on an erasure,</b> and the appearance of that erasure can be compared with the appearance of a double erasure. But in a case <b>where the witnesses are signed not on an erasure but on paper</b> that has not had its writing erased, so that there is no contrast between a single erasure and a double erasure, the forgery would <b>not</b> be <b>known.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>But</b> let the court <b>bring another parchment,</b> write something on it <b>and erase it, and</b> then <b>compare</b> this single erasure with the erasure on the document in question. If the document were erased twice, a contrast would be seen between a single erasure and a double erasure. The Gemara answers: <b>The erasure of this parchment is not</b> necessarily <b>similar to the erasure of that parchment.</b> A single erasure on one parchment might resemble a double erasure on a different parchment.
The Gemara continues to suggest: <b>But let us accept,</b> i.e., verify, <b>the signatures of the witnesses</b> on the document <b>in court,</b> after which they may safely be erased; <b>and</b> then <b>erase</b> the signatures <b>and compare</b> that erasure to the erasure of the document text, to see if it was erased once or twice. In response to this question <b>Rav Hoshaya says:</b> That which is <b>erased on the same day</b> that it was written <b>is not</b> necessarily <b>similar to</b> that which was <b>erased two days</b> ago, i.e., more than a day after it was written. An older erasure looks different from a new one, so the comparison might not show that there was a double erasure in the document.
The Gemara suggests: <b>But let us retain</b> the document for an extra day, at which point both erasures will be old and can be compared. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said</b> in response: <b>We are concerned for</b> the possibility of <b>an erring court.</b> If such complicated procedures were used in order to declare a document valid, there would be a chance that a particular court would not apply them properly, and that court would end up ratifying a document that was not valid.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel says: A tied</b> document whose witnesses wrote their signatures inside of it is valid, because one can transform it into an ordinary document by untying it. <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>raised an objection to the statement of Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel:</b>

Daf 164b

<b>But the date of this one,</b> a tied document, <b>is not the same as the date of that one,</b> an ordinary document. In <b>an ordinary</b> document, when the king has <b>reigned</b> for one <b>year,</b> one <b>year is counted for him,</b> and when he has reigned for <b>two</b> years, <b>two</b> years <b>are counted for him.</b> By contrast, in <b>a tied</b> document, when the king has <b>reigned</b> for one <b>year, two</b> years <b>are counted for him,</b> and when he has reigned for <b>two</b> years, <b>three</b> years <b>are counted for him.</b> If a tied document is simply opened up and used as an ordinary document, then it will emerge that it is postdated by a year.
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi continues: <b>And</b> there are <b>times</b> this can be problematic, as in a case <b>where</b> the debtor <b>borrows money from</b> the creditor, and the details of the loan are written <b>in a tied</b> document. <b>And</b> the debtor <b>chances upon</b> some <b>money in the interim,</b> i.e., during the first year after the document was written, <b>and</b> he <b>repays</b> the creditor, <b>and says to him: Give me</b> back <b>my</b> promissory <b>note,</b> as I have just repaid you. <b>And</b> the creditor <b>says to</b> the debtor: <b>I lost</b> the document and cannot give it to you. <b>And</b> in lieu of returning the promissory note, the creditor <b>writes a receipt</b> for the debtor, as protection against a second collection.
Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi continues: <b>And</b> then, <b>when the time for</b> repayment written in the promissory note <b>arrives,</b> the creditor will <b>make it</b> into <b>an ordinary</b> document by undoing its stitches and opening it up, <b>and</b> he can then <b>say to</b> the debtor: <b>It is now that you borrowed this</b> money <b>from me,</b> as attested in this promissory note, and the receipt you have in your possession is for a previous debt, as its date precedes the date on my document.
The Gemara answers: Rabbi Ḥanina ben Gamliel <b>holds</b> that <b>one does not write a receipt</b> in such cases. If a creditor loses his promissory note, the debtor need not pay him at all, out of concern that the debt may one day be collected again when the promissory note is found. He is not required to pay the debt and accept only a receipt, which he will then have to guard permanently to protect himself against a second collection.
The Gemara asks with regard to the previous discussion: <b>And was Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>expert in</b> the <i>halakhot</i> of <b>tied</b> documents? <b>But</b> wasn’t there <b>a certain tied</b> document <b>that came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and</b> when <b>Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi saw the date he <b>said: This is a postdated document. And</b> a Sage named <b>Zunin said to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Such is the custom of this nation;</b> when the king has <b>reigned</b> for one <b>year, two</b> years <b>are counted for him,</b> and when he has reigned for <b>two</b> years, <b>three</b> years <b>are counted for him.</b> The document is therefore not postdated. From this anecdote it is clear that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi himself had not been familiar with this practice.
The Gemara answers: <b>After</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>heard it from Zunin</b> he accepted the explanation <b>and held this</b> way himself, and that is what prompted him to raise his objection.
§ There was <b>a certain document on which was written,</b> as its date: <b>In the year of so-and-so, Archon [<i>Arkhan</i>],</b> a title for a ruler, without stating any particular year of his reign. <b>Rabbi Ḥanina said: Let it be investigated when</b> it was that this <b>Archon rose to his</b> position of <b>archon,</b> i.e., find out the year he came to power, and the validity of the document is established from that year.
The Gemara suggests: <b>But perhaps</b> the writer of the document was using an Aramaic or Hebrew term, and intended to say <b>that the reign of</b> so-and-so had already <b>extended [<i>arikh</i>]</b> for several years. <b>Rav Hoshaya says: Such</b> is <b>the custom of this nation</b> where the document was written: In the <b>first year</b> of the king’s reign <b>they refer to him</b> with the title <b>Archon;</b> in his <b>second</b> year <b>they refer to him</b> with the title <b><i>Digon</i>.</b>
The Gemara suggests: <b>But perhaps</b> the people <b>deposed</b> the ruler <b>and then reinstated him,</b> and the document was written in the first year of his second reign. <b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> In <b>that</b> case, <b>they</b> would <b>refer to him</b> with the title <b>Archon <i>Digon</i>.</b>
§ Apropos these Greek terms, the Gemara cites two <i>baraitot</i> that mention them. <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Nazir</i> 1:2) that if one said: <b>I am hereby a nazirite <i>heina</i>,</b> or stated a similar expression with other comparable Greek terms, <b>Sumakhos said</b> that his status depends on which term he used. If he used the word <b><i>heina</i>,</b> he is a nazirite for <b>one</b> term of naziriteship, i.e., thirty days; if he said <b><i>digon</i>,</b> he is a nazirite for <b>two</b> terms of thirty days each; if he said <b><i>terigon</i>,</b> he is a nazirite for <b>three</b> terms; <b><i>tetrigon</i>,</b> for <b>four</b> terms; <b><i>pentigon</i>,</b> for <b>five</b> terms.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Nega’im</i> 6:3): <b>A round house,</b> or one that is shaped like <b>a <i>digon</i>,</b> i.e., it has two walls, one straight and one curved, or one that is shaped like <b>a <i>terigon</i>,</b> i.e., a triangle, or one that is shaped like <b>a pentagon, does not become susceptible to the ritual impurity of leprous spots.</b> If it is shaped like <b>a <i>tetrigon</i>,</b> i.e., a quadrilateral, it <b>becomes susceptible to the ritual impurity of leprous spots.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>From where are these matters</b> derived? The Gemara answers: It is <b>as the Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: The Torah <b>states above:</b> “If the plague be in the walls of the house” (Leviticus 14:37). The verse did not state: <b>A wall,</b> but <b>“walls,”</b> indicating that the house in question has at least <b>two</b> walls. And where it <b>states below:</b> “If the plague has spread in the walls of the house” (Leviticus 14:39), instead of stating: <b>A wall,</b> the verse states <b>“walls,”</b> indicating another <b>two</b> walls. There <b>are</b> a total of <b>four</b> walls mentioned <b>here</b> in order to indicate that a house can become impure through leprous spots only if it has four sides.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain tied</b> document <b>that came before Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>and Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, not realizing it was a folded document, <b>said: There is no date on this</b> document, so it is not valid. <b>Rabbi Shimon, son of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi, <b>said to Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi: <b>Perhaps</b> the date is <b>hidden between its tied</b> folds. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>opened it and saw</b> that the date was in fact between the tied folds. <b>Afterward, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>looked at</b> his son <b>disapprovingly,</b> as he held that one should not write a tied document. His son <b>said to him: I did not write it; Rabbi Yehuda Ḥayyata wrote it.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>said to</b> his son: <b>Turn away from</b> uttering <b>this</b> kind of <b>malicious speech.</b>
Another <b>time,</b> Rabbi Shimon <b>was sitting before</b> his father <b>and reciting a section of the book of Psalms. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>said</b> to him: <b>How straight</b> and neat is <b>this writing</b> in this book from which you are reading. Rabbi Shimon <b>said to him: I did not write it; Yehuda Ḥayyata wrote it.</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi <b>told</b> his son: <b>Turn away from</b> uttering <b>this</b> kind of <b>malicious speech.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>Granted, there,</b> in the first episode, <b>there is malicious speech</b> involved, since Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was displeased with the writer of the document, <b>but here,</b> in the second episode, <b>what malicious speech is there?</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi was complimenting the writer of the book of Psalms, not criticizing him. The Gemara answers: It is <b>because of</b> what <b>Rav Dimi</b> teaches. <b>As Rav Dimi, the brother of Rav Safra, teaches: A person should never speak the praises of another, as out of the praise</b> spoken about <b>him</b> someone may <b>come to</b> speak to <b>his detriment.</b>
<b>Rav Amram says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> There are <b>three sins from which a person is not spared each day.</b> They are: Having <b>sinful thoughts, and</b> committing sins concerning <b>deliberation in prayer, and</b> uttering <b>malicious speech.</b> The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that a person cannot go through the day without uttering <b>malicious speech?</b>

Daf 165a

The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> Rav was referring to uttering <b>a hint,</b> i.e., words with a bare trace, <b>of malicious speech.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b>majority</b> of people suc-cumb to sin <b>with regard to robbery, and a minority</b> of people succumb to sin <b>with regard to sexual matters, and everyone</b> succumbs to sin <b>with regard to malicious speech.</b> The Gemara asks: Can it <b>enter your mind</b> that all people sin <b>with regard to malicious speech?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>Rather,</b> Rav was referring to uttering <b>a hint of malicious speech.</b>
§ The mishna teaches, with regard to documents, that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: Everything</b> is <b>in accordance with regional custom.</b> The Gemara wonders: <b>And does the first <i>tanna</i> not accept</b> that one should follow the <b>regional custom?</b> It is not reasonable that he would take issue with such a basic concept.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> in explanation: <b>In a place where the custom</b> is to write <b>an ordinary</b> document, <b>and</b> one <b>said to</b> a scribe: <b>Make an ordinary</b> document <b>for me, and</b> the scribe <b>went</b> and <b>made a tied</b> document <b>for him,</b> it is assumed that he was <b>particular</b> about wanting an ordinary document. Similarly, in a place where <b>the custom</b> is to write <b>a tied</b> document, <b>and</b> one <b>said to</b> a scribe: <b>Make a tied</b> document <b>for me, and</b> the scribe <b>went</b> and <b>made an ordinary</b> document <b>for him,</b> it is assumed that he was <b>particular</b> about wanting a tied document. In both of these cases, the document is considered to have been written without the consent of the one who requested it. If it is a bill of divorce it may not be used, as a bill of divorce must be written with the knowledge and consent of the husband.
<b>When</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> of the mishna <b>disagree</b> is <b>in a place where the custom</b> is to write <b>both an ordinary</b> document <b>and a tied</b> document, <b>and</b> one <b>said to</b> a scribe: <b>Make an ordinary</b> document <b>for me, and</b> the scribe <b>went and made a tied</b> document <b>for him.</b> In such a case, one <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that the one requesting the document was <b>particular</b> about wanting an ordinary document, and since the scribe wrote a tied document, it is considered to have been written without his consent. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds</b> that the one requesting the document was merely <b>indicating</b> his <b>position to</b> the scribe, stating that if the scribe wanted to save himself the trouble of writing a tied document there would no objection.
<b>Abaye said:</b> Concerning <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, and Rabbi Shimon, and Rabbi Elazar, they all hold</b> that when one gives instructions to an agent, he is merely <b>indicating</b> his <b>position to him,</b> as opposed to expressing an insistence on certain details.
<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel</b> holds this is the case, <b>as we have</b> just <b>said. Rabbi Shimon</b> holds this as well, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Kiddushin</i> 48a), as explained by the Gemara there, that the first <i>tanna</i> rules that if a woman appoints an agent to accept her betrothal money and tells him that the man will be giving a golden dinar, or that he will be giving a silver dinar, and he in fact gives the other type of dinar, the betrothal is not valid, as in accepting the wrong dinar the agent did not follow the woman’s instructions exactly.
But <b>Rabbi Shimon says: If he misled her to</b> her <b>advantage,</b> i.e., he told her he was going to give a silver dinar and gave her a golden dinar, <b>she is betrothed.</b> When the woman told the agent to receive the silver dinar she did not mean to insist that the dinar be silver as opposed to gold, but was only indicating her position, which is that she would have no objection to receiving only a silver dinar.
Abaye continues: <b>Rabbi Elazar</b> also holds this, <b>as we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 65a): With regard to <b>the woman who,</b> when designating her agent for receipt of her bill of divorce, <b>said</b> to her agent: <b>Receive my bill of divorce for me in such and such a place, and he received it for her in another place,</b> the divorce is <b>invalid; and Rabbi Elazar deems</b> it <b>valid.</b> One <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that the woman is <b>particular</b> that her instructions be followed, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabbi Elazar, <b>holds</b> that she was merely <b>indicating</b> her <b>position to</b> the agent, informing him of where she thought her husband would be.
§ The mishna teaches: With regard to <b>an ordinary</b> document <b>in which</b> the signature of <b>a single witness is written,</b> and a tied document in which the signatures of only two witnesses are written, they are both not valid. The Gemara asks: <b>Granted,</b> it <b>was necessary</b> for the mishna to teach that <b>a tied</b> document <b>in which</b> the signatures of only <b>two witnesses are written</b> is <b>not valid,</b> as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since generally</b> a document is <b>valid</b> with two signatures, <b>here too</b> it is <b>valid;</b> therefore, the mishna <b>teaches us that</b> it is in fact <b>not valid. But</b> why was it necessary to state that <b>an ordinary</b> document <b>in which</b> the signature of <b>a single witness is written</b> is not valid; isn’t this <b>obvious?</b>
<b>Abaye said:</b> It <b>is necessary</b> to state this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> to teach <b>that even</b> if there is <b>one witness</b> signed on the document <b>in writing and,</b> in addition, <b>one witness</b> testifies <b>orally</b> to the contents of the document, the document is not valid.
The Gemara relates: <b>Ameimar deemed</b> a document <b>valid in</b> the case of <b>one witness</b> signed on the document <b>in writing and one witness</b> testifying <b>orally</b> to the contents of the document. <b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar: And what of that</b> statement <b>of Abaye,</b> which deemed such a document invalid? Ameimar <b>said to him: I did not hear</b> of it, as though <b>to say: I do not hold</b> like it; I disagree with Abaye.
Rav Ashi asks: <b>But</b> if you disagree, the <b>difficulty</b>

Daf 165b

with <b>the mishna</b> remains: Why does the mishna state that which is obvious, that a document with a single witness’s signature is not valid?
The Gemara answers that the mishna <b>teaches us this: That</b> the case of <b>two</b> witnesses signed <b>on a tied</b> document is <b>similar to</b> the case of <b>one witness</b> signed <b>on an ordinary</b> document: <b>Just as there,</b> in the case of a single witness signed on an ordinary document, <b>the disqualification</b> is <b>by Torah law, so too here,</b> in the case of two witnesses signed on a tied document, <b>the disqualification</b> is <b>by Torah law.</b>
Ameimar added: <b>Know</b> that the signature of one witness on a document and the oral testimony of one person about it can be combined into a single testimony, <b>as the colleagues</b> of the academy <b>sent</b> a question <b>from there,</b> i.e., Eretz Yisrael, <b>to Rabbi Yirmeya</b> seeking clarification of a <i>baraita</i>. The <i>baraita</i> states that the first <i>tanna</i> holds that the testimony of two witnesses to an event can be combined into a single testimony only if both of them witnessed the event together, while Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa holds that the testimony can be combined even if they saw the event one after the other. Furthermore, the first <i>tanna</i> holds that their testimony is accepted only if they both testify together. By contrast, Rabbi Natan holds that the testimony of one witness may be accepted today, and when the other witness comes the next day his testimony may be accepted, and the two testimonies may thereby be combined.
The dilemma they posed to Rabbi Yirmeya was this: In the case of a loan for which there is <b>one witness in writing,</b> signed on a promissory note, <b>and one</b> other <b>witness</b> who testifies to the loan <b>orally, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the possibility <b>that</b> the two of them <b>will combine</b> to testify as two witnesses?
The dilemma is clarified: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i>, who engages in a dispute <b>with Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa, you should not raise the dilemma, as</b> according to his opinion there are situations where <b>even two</b> testimonies <b>in writing or two oral</b> testimonies <b>are not combined</b> into a single testimony. All the more so they are not combined when one is written and one is oral. <b>Rather, when should you raise the dilemma?</b> Raise it <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa.</b> The dilemma is: Is it only testimonies of <b>two</b> witnesses <b>in writing or two oral</b> witnesses <b>that are combined</b> into a single testimony, <b>but we do not combine</b> testimony of <b>one witness in writing and one orally? Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference</b> between these cases.
Rabbi Yirmeya humbly <b>sent</b> back his response <b>to</b> the colleagues of the academy: <b>I am not worthy</b> of being the recipient of the query <b>that you sent to me. But this</b> is how <b>the opinion of your student,</b> i.e., himself, <b>leans: That</b> the testimonies <b>should be combined.</b> This exchange between Rabbi Yirmeya and his questioners indicates that Ameimar’s opinion is accepted.
Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Ameimar: <b>We teach</b> this entire incident with Rabbi Yirmeya differently, <b>as follows: That the colleagues</b> of the academy <b>sent</b> this question <b>to Rabbi Yirmeya:</b> If there are <b>two</b> witnesses <b>who testified, one in this court and one in that court, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the possibility <b>that</b> the judges of one <b>court could come to</b> the other <b>court and</b> in this manner the two testimonies <b>will be combined</b> to become a valid testimony of two witnesses?
The dilemma is clarified: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i>, who also engages in a dispute <b>with Rabbi Natan, you should not raise the dilemma, as</b> according to his opinion, testimonies that are not given concurrently <b>are not combined even in one court;</b> all the more so when they are given in two different courts. <b>Rather, when should you raise the dilemma?</b> Raise it <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Natan.</b> The dilemma is: Is it <b>in one court that</b> the two separate testimonies <b>are combined, but</b> when they are given <b>in two</b> separate <b>courts they are not combined? Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference.</b>
<b>And</b> Rabbi Yirmeya <b>sent</b> back his response <b>to them: I am not worthy</b> of being the recipient of the query <b>that you sent to me. But this</b> is how <b>the opinion of your student leans: That they should be combined.</b> According to this version of the exchange between Rabbi Yirmeya and his questioners there is no relevance to Ameimar’s statement.
<b>Mar bar Ḥiyya said</b> yet a third version, that the dilemma the colleagues of the academy <b>sent to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya is <b>as follows:</b> If there are <b>two</b> witnesses <b>who testified in this court and then testified in that court, what is</b> the <i>halakha</i> with regard to the possibility <b>that one</b> judge would <b>come from each court</b> to one location and relate the testimony he had heard to the other, <b>and</b> in this manner the two testimonies <b>will be combined?</b>
The dilemma is clarified: <b>According to</b> the opinion <b>of Rabbi Natan you should not raise the dilemma. Now</b> that he maintains that <b>we combine</b> two individual <b>witnesses, is</b> it <b>necessary</b> to ask if <b>judges</b> may be combined in this manner? They certainly can be combined. <b>Rather, when should you raise the dilemma?</b> Raise it <b>according to</b> the opinion <b>of the first <i>tanna</i></b> of the <i>baraita</i>, who engages in a dispute <b>with Rabbi Natan.</b> The dilemma is: <b>Is</b> it only testimony of <b>witnesses that we do not combine</b> into a single testimony, <b>but we do combine judges</b> from two different courts? <b>Or perhaps</b> there <b>is no difference.</b>
Rabbi Yirmeya <b>sent</b> back his response <b>to them: I am not worthy</b> of being the recipient of the query <b>that you sent to me. But this is</b> how <b>the opinion of your student leans: That they should be combined.</b>
<b>Ravina said</b> a fourth version, that the dilemma the colleagues of the academy <b>sent to</b> Rabbi Yirmeya is <b>as follows:</b> If there were <b>three</b> judges <b>who sat</b> as a court <b>to ratify a document, and,</b> after verifying the signatures of the witnesses, <b>one of</b> the judges <b>died, must they</b> mention this in their statement of ratification, to account for why the declaration is signed by only two judges, and <b>write: We were sitting in</b> a group of <b>three</b> judges, <b>and one of</b> the judges <b>is no</b> longer alive? <b>Or</b> perhaps they are <b>not</b> required to write this.
Rabbi Yirmeya <b>sent</b> back his response <b>to them: I am not worthy</b> of being the recipient of the query <b>that you sent to me. But this is</b> how <b>the opinion of your student leans: That they are required to write: We were sitting in</b> a group of <b>three</b> judges, <b>and one of</b> the judges <b>is no</b> longer alive.
The Gemara relates: <b>And</b> it was <b>because of this</b> fitting answer, to whichever version of the dilemma that is adopted, that the Sages <b>brought Rabbi Yirmeya into the study hall</b> after he had been expelled, as related earlier in this tractate (23b).
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> If <b>it is written in</b> a document that someone owes: <b>One hundred dinars, which are twenty <i>sela</i>,</b> which is internally inconsistent since there are twenty-five <i>sela</i> in a hundred dinars, the holder of the document <b>has</b> the right to claim <b>only twenty</b> <i>sela</i>, the lower of the two amounts. If it is written that he owes: <b>One hundred dinars, which are thirty <i>sela</i>,</b> the holder of the document <b>has</b> the right to claim <b>only one hundred dinars,</b> again the lower of the two amounts.
If it is written that someone owes: <b>Silver dinars that are, and</b> the remainder of the text, where the number of dinars should be specified, <b>was erased,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than two</b> dinars, the lowest amount to which the plural word dinars can be referring. That is what the creditor can claim. Similarly, if it is written: <b>Silver <i>sela</i> that are, and</b> the remainder of the text <b>was erased,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than two</b> <i>sela</i>. And if it is written: <b>Darics that are, and</b> the remainder of the text <b>was erased,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than two</b> darics.
If it is <b>written in</b> the document <b>above,</b> in an earlier place in the document, that someone owes <b>one hundred dinars, and below,</b> toward the end of the document, it is written that the amount owed is <b>two hundred</b> dinars, or if <b>above</b> it is written <b>two hundred</b> dinars <b>and below one hundred dinars, everything follows the bottom</b> amount. <b>If so, why</b> does one <b>write</b> the information in <b>the upper</b> part of the document at all? It is a safety measure, <b>so</b> that <b>if one letter is erased from the lower</b> part of the document, thereby rendering it illegible, the information <b>can be learned from the upper</b> part of the document.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:2): If a document <b>states</b> that someone owes <b>silver,</b> without specifying which silver coin, the amount must be <b>no less than a silver dinar.</b> If it states: <b>Silver dinars, or: Dinars silver,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than two silver dinars,</b> the lowest amount to which that phrase can refer. If it states: <b>Silver, in dinars,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than two golden dinars’</b> worth of <b>silver.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the beginning of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master says:</b> If a document states that someone owes <b>silver,</b> without specifying which silver coin, the amount must be <b>no less than a silver dinar.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the intention of the word silver is not to a coin at all, but to a small <b>piece</b> of silver? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The case of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>where</b> the word <b>coin is written in</b> the document. The Gemara asks further: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the intent is not a dinar, but smaller coins, such as <b><i>perutot</i>? Rav Pappa said:</b> The <i>halakha</i> of the <i>baraita</i> is stated <b>with regard to a place where silver <i>perutot</i> do not circulate.</b>
<b>The Sages taught</b> in the continuation of the <i>baraita</i>: If it is written in a document that someone owes <b>gold,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than a golden dinar.</b> If it is written: <b>Golden dinars, or: Dinars golden,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than two golden dinars.</b> If it is written: <b>Gold, in dinars,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than two silver dinars’</b> worth of <b>gold.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the beginning of this section of the <i>baraita</i>. <b>The Master says:</b> If it is written in a document that someone owes <b>gold,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than a golden dinar.</b> The Gemara asks: But why not <b>say</b> that the intention of the word gold is not to a coin at all, but to a small <b>piece</b> of gold? <b>Rabbi Elazar said:</b> The case of the <i>baraita</i> is <b>where</b> the word <b>coin is written</b> in the document.

Daf 166a

The Gemara asks further: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the intent is not a dinar, but smaller coins, such as <b><i>perutot</i>?</b> The Gemara answers: <b>People do not make <i>perutot</i> of gold.</b>
The Gemara continues its analysis of the <i>baraita</i>, which states: If it is written: <b>Gold, in dinars,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than two silver dinars’</b> worth of <b>gold.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>But</b> why not <b>say</b> that the document <b>is speaking</b> of <b>two golden dinars’</b> worth of <b>pieces of gold? Abaye says:</b> This interpretation is also possible, but the guiding principle in all interpretations of ambiguities is that <b>the holder of the document</b> is <b>at a disadvantage.</b>
The Gemara asks a question from <b>the first clause</b> of the <i>baraita</i>, <b>which teaches</b> that if the document states: <b>Silver in dinars,</b> the amount must be <b>no less than two golden dinars’</b> worth of <b>silver. Why</b> is he entitled to so much? <b>Say</b> that the document <b>is speaking</b> of <b>silver</b> only, and means: <b>Two silver dinars’</b> worth of silver <b>pieces.</b> This interpretation would be a lower value than the interpretation assigned to it by the <i>baraita</i>, and would be in keeping with the principle that the holder of the document is at a disadvantage.
<b>Rav Ashi said</b> in reply that the text of the <i>baraita</i> should be emended: In <b>the first clause</b> the case is <b>that</b> the scribe <b>wrote:</b> Silver in dinars, using the plural form <b><i>dinarei</i>,</b> which refers specifically to golden dinars. In <b>the latter clause,</b> the case is <b>that</b> the scribe <b>wrote:</b> Gold in dinars, using the plural form <b><i>dinarin</i>,</b> which denotes silver dinars specifically.
The Gemara supports its assertion that there is a difference between these two plural forms: <b>And from where do you say that</b> there is <b>a difference between</b> the words <b><i>dinarei</i> and <i>dinarin</i>?</b>
This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a mishna (<i>Karetot</i> 8a): In the case of <b>a woman for whom there was uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>five births,</b> and likewise a woman for whom there was <b>uncertainty</b> with regard to <b>five</b> irregular <b>discharges</b> of blood from the uterus [<i>ziva</i>], <b>she brings one offering, and</b> then <b>she may partake of</b> the meat of <b>offerings. And the remaining</b> offerings <b>are not an obligation for her.</b> If she <b>has in her</b> case <b>five definite births</b> or <b>five definite discharges of a <i>zava</i>, she brings one offering, and</b> then <b>she may partake of</b> the meat of <b>offerings. And the remaining</b> offerings <b>are an obligation for her.</b>
That mishna continues: There was <b>an incident where</b> the price of <b>nests,</b> i.e., pairs of birds, <b>stood in Jerusalem at golden <i>dinarei</i>,</b> as the great demand for birds for the offerings of a woman after childbirth and a <i>zava</i> led to an increase in the price. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said:</b> I take an oath by <b>this abode</b> of the Divine Presence that <b>I will not lie</b> down <b>tonight until</b> the price of nests <b>will be in <i>dinarin</i>.</b> Ultimately, <b>he entered the court and taught: A woman for whom there were five definite births</b> or <b>five definite discharges of a <i>zava</i> brings one offering, and</b> then <b>she may partake of</b> the meat of <b>offerings. And the remaining</b> offerings <b>are not an obligation for her.</b>

Daf 166b

The mishna concludes: <b>And</b> as a result, the price of the <b>nests stood that day at one-quarter</b> of a silver dinar, as the demand for nests decreased. It is clear in the mishna that the term <i>dinarei</i> indicates a higher value than the term <i>dinarin</i>.
§ The mishna teaches: If it is <b>written</b> in the document <b>above</b> that someone owes one hundred dinars, and below it is written two hundred dinars, or if above it is written two hundred and below one hundred, everything follows the bottom amount. If so, why does one write the information in the upper part of the document at all? It is a safety measure, so that if one letter is erased from the lower part of the document, thereby rendering it illegible, the information can be learned from the upper part of the document. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:4): Information concerning what is written <b>below may be learned from</b> what is written <b>above</b> if the lower text is missing <b>one letter, but not</b> if it is missing <b>two letters.</b> In that case, in the event of a discrepancy between information written above and information written below, the document is not valid.
<b>For example,</b> if the name of one party is written as <b>Ḥanan</b> below and Ḥanani above, it may be derived <b>from</b> the word <b>Ḥanani</b> written above that the party is named Ḥanani. <b>And</b> similarly, if a name is written <b>Anan</b> below, it may be learned <b>from</b> the name <b>Anani</b> written above that the party is named Anani.
The Gemara asks: <b>What is different</b> about <b>two letters</b> missing, that the <i>baraita</i> teaches <b>that</b> the name written below <b>cannot</b> be corrected from the name written above? The Gemara suggests: It is out of concern that <b>perhaps</b> it will <b>occur</b> by chance that there is <b>a four-letter name, and</b> the omission of two letters <b>would be half of the name,</b> and for this reason the Sages extended this concern to all cases where two letters are missing. The Gemara challenges: <b>If so,</b> the same could be said when <b>one letter</b> is missing <b>as well,</b> as <b>perhaps</b> it will <b>occur</b> by chance that there is <b>a two-letter name, and</b> the omission of one letter <b>would be half of the name.</b>
The Gemara explains: <b>Rather, this is the reason</b> that when <b>two letters</b> are missing the name written below cannot be corrected from the name written above: The concern is that <b>perhaps</b> it will <b>occur</b> by chance that there is <b>a three-letter name, and</b> the omission of two letters <b>would be a majority of the name.</b> The Sages applied this concern to all cases where two letters are missing.
The Gemara continues to discuss discrepancies between the information written above and below in a document. <b>Rav Pappa said:</b> It is <b>obvious to me</b> that if a document states <b>above</b> that one owes <b>a <i>sefel</i>,</b> a type of cup, <b>and below</b> it states <b><i>kefel</i>,</b> a type of garment, <b>everything is determined by the</b> information written <b>below.</b> In this case there is not a missing letter at the bottom but an altered letter. Therefore, the information written below is not corrected from the information written above.
<b>Rav Pappa raises a dilemma: What</b> if it is stated <b><i>kefel</i> above and <i>sefel</i> below?</b> The difference between the two words is that the former begins with <i>kuf</i>, whereas the latter begins with <i>samekh</i>. The orthographical difference between these two letters is a single stroke that extends downward, as the omission of the extension of this stroke would change <i>kuf</i> into <i>samekh</i>. Rav Pappa’s dilemma is: <b>Are we concerned for</b> the possibility that <b>a fly</b> landed on the stroke of the <i>kuf</i>, removing the ink and changing it into <i>samekh</i>? <b>Or</b> are we <b>not</b> concerned with this possibility? The Gemara comments: The dilemma <b>shall stand</b> unresolved.
§ The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> document <b>in which it was written</b> that the amount due was <b>six hundred and a dinar,</b> without specifying to which denomination the six hundred amount referred. <b>Rav Sherevya sent</b> this question <b>before Abaye:</b> Does the holder of the document collect <b>six hundred <i>istira</i> and a dinar?</b> <i>Istira</i> is another name for a <i>sela</i>, which equals four dinars. <b>Or</b> is he <b>perhaps</b> entitled to collect only <b>six hundred <i>perutot</i> and a dinar,</b> a <i>peruta</i> being a small fraction of a dinar? Abaye <b>said to him: Remove</b> the possibility of six hundred <b><i>perutot</i>, since</b> people <b>do not write</b> large numbers of <i>perutot</i> <b>in a document, as they</b> instead <b>combine them</b> into larger denominations

Daf 167a

<b>and change them</b> into a smaller number of <b>dinars.</b> Therefore, <b>what can you say?</b> The highest and lowest remaining possibilities are: <b>Six hundred <i>istira</i> and a dinar,</b> and <b>six hundred dinars and one</b> more <b>dinar.</b> The guiding principle is that <b>the holder of the document</b> is <b>at a disadvantage,</b> and the lesser of these two values is assumed.
§ <b>Abaye said:</b> With regard to <b>this one who needs to show his signature in court</b> for the purpose of corroborating his signature on a document, he <b>should not show</b> it by writing it <b>at the end of the parchment, lest another,</b> unscrupulous, person <b>find</b> the parchment <b>and write</b> above the signature <b>that</b> the signatory <b>owes him money. And</b> such a document would be valid, as <b>we learned</b> in a mishna (175b): If one <b>presents to</b> a debtor a document in the <b>handwriting of</b> the debtor stating <b>that he owes</b> money <b>to him,</b> but without witnesses signed on the document, the creditor <b>can collect</b> only <b>from unsold property,</b> i.e., property that is currently in the possession of the debtor.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> Jewish <b>tax collector who came before Abaye</b> and <b>said to him: Let the Master show me his signature</b> on a piece of paper to keep in my records, <b>as when rabbis come</b> to me and <b>show me</b> a note with your signature on it, attesting to the fact that they are Torah scholars, <b>I let them pass without</b> paying the <b>tax. Abaye showed him</b> his signature <b>at the top of the parchment,</b> though the unscrupulous tax collector kept <b>pulling</b> the parchment away from Abaye so that the signature would be at the bottom. Abaye noticed this and <b>said to him: The Sages</b> have <b>already anticipated</b> people such as <b>you</b> and advised that one should never write his signature at the bottom of a paper.
§ <b>Abaye said:</b> When writing a promissory note, one <b>should not write</b> any number <b>from three until ten at the end of a line, lest</b> someone <b>commit forgery and write</b> an extension to the number, since it is at the end of the line. In Hebrew and Aramaic, the words for the numbers three through nine can be changed to thirty through ninety, respectively, by appending to them the suffix <i>in</i>, written with the letters <i>yod</i> and <i>nun</i>. Ten can be changed to twenty in a similar manner. <b>And if</b> by chance <b>it occurs for him</b> that these numbers fall out at the end of a line, <b>he should repeat his words two</b> or <b>three times,</b> stating and restating the agreement in question, as <b>it is impossible that</b> the number will <b>not</b> eventually <b>occur for him in the middle of a line.</b> When there is a contradiction, it is the final mention of the amount that is authoritative, as the mishna teaches.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> bill of sale <b>in which it was written</b> that the item sold was: In my garden, <b>one-third of the orchard.</b> The purchaser <b>went</b> and <b>erased the roof and the foot of the <i>beit</i></b> of the term: Of the orchard [<i>befardeisa</i>], <b>and</b> thereby <b>changed</b> the prefix <i>beit</i> into a <i>vav</i>, yielding: In my garden one-third, <b>and the orchard [<i>ufardeisa</i>],</b> indicating that the sale included one-third of the garden in addition to all of the orchard. The document <b>came before Abaye,</b> who <b>said to</b> the purchaser: <b>What is the reason</b> that there is <b>so much space around this <i>vav</i>?</b> Since the letter <i>vav</i> is narrower than the letter <i>beit</i>, a larger space between letters emerged as compared to the spacing of letters in the rest of the document. Abaye <b>bound</b> the purchaser, i.e., he subjected him to physical coercion, <b>and he admitted</b> to the forgery.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain</b> bill of sale <b>in which it was written</b> that the item being sold was: <b>The portions of Reuven and Shimon, brothers [<i>aḥei</i>].</b> Reuven and Shimon happened to <b>have a brother whose name</b> was <b>Aḥai,</b> which, when writing without vowels, is spelled identically to <i>aḥei</i>. The purchaser <b>went</b> and <b>wrote</b> a conjunctive <b><i>vav</i> in</b> the document before the word <i>aḥei</i>, <b>and changed</b> the wording into: The portions of Reuven and Shimon <b>and Aḥai.</b> The document <b>came before Abaye,</b> who <b>said to</b> the purchaser: <b>What is the reason</b> that it is <b>so crowded around this <i>vav</i>?</b> By inserting the extra <i>vav</i>, a smaller space between letters emerged as compared to the spacing of letters in the rest of the document. Abaye <b>bound</b> the purchaser, i.e., he subjected him to physical coercion, <b>and he admitted</b> the forgery.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain document upon which</b> the signatures of <b>Rava and Rav Aḥa bar Adda were signed.</b> The one holding the document <b>came before Rava,</b> who <b>said to him: This is my signature, but I never signed</b> any document <b>before Rav Aḥa bar Adda.</b> Rava <b>bound</b> the holder of the document, i.e., he subjected him to physical coercion, <b>and he admitted</b> the forgery. Rava <b>said to him: Granted, you</b> were able to <b>forge my</b> signature, <b>but how did you perform</b> a forgery of <b>Rav Aḥa bar Adda’s</b> signature, <b>since his hands shake</b> and as a result his signature is distinctive? The man <b>said: I placed my hands on</b> the rope of <b>a narrow footbridge [<i>amitzra</i>],</b> and was thereby able to duplicate Rav Aḥa’s signature. <b>And some say</b> that the forgery was accomplished when the forger <b>stood upon a</b> wobbly <b>water skin [<i>azarnuka</i>] and wrote</b> the signature.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> A scribe may <b>write a bill of divorce for a man</b> who requests one, <b>even if his wife is not with him</b> to give her consent when he presents his request, as there is no possibility that he will misuse the document. <b>And</b> a scribe may write <b>a receipt for a woman</b> upon her request, attesting to the payment of her marriage contract, <b>even if her husband is not with her</b> to give his consent. This is true <b>provided that</b> the scribe <b>recognizes</b> the parties requesting the document, to prevent misrepresentation. <b>And</b> for both documents, <b>the husband gives</b> the scribe his <b>wages.</b>

Daf 167b

A scribe may <b>write</b> a promissory <b>note for a debtor</b> who requests one, <b>even if</b> the <b>creditor is not with him</b> when he requests the document, <b>but</b> a scribe may <b>not write</b> a promissory note <b>for a creditor</b> who requests it <b>unless</b> the <b>debtor is with him</b> and consents. <b>And</b> it is <b>the debtor</b> who <b>gives</b> the scribe his <b>wages.</b>
A scribe may <b>write a bill</b> of sale <b>for a seller</b> of a field who requests one <b>even if the purchaser is not with him</b> when he presents his request, <b>but</b> a scribe may <b>not write</b> a bill of sale <b>for a purchaser</b> who requests it <b>unless the seller is with him</b> and consents. <b>And</b> it is <b>the purchaser</b> who <b>gives</b> the scribe his <b>wages.</b>
A scribe may <b>not write documents of betrothal and</b> documents of <b>marriage except with the consent of both</b> parties, the groom and the bride. <b>And</b> it is <b>the groom</b> who <b>gives</b> the scribe his <b>wages.</b>
A scribe may <b>not write contracts for sharecroppers and contractors except with the consent of both</b> parties, i.e., the sharecropper or contractor and the one who hires him. <b>And</b> it is <b>the</b> sharecropper or <b>contractor</b> who <b>gives</b> the scribe his <b>wages.</b>
A scribe may <b>not write documents</b> testifying to <b>arbitration</b> agreements <b>or any</b> other <b>court enactment except with the consent of both</b> parties to the litigation. <b>And both</b> parties <b>give</b> the scribe his <b>wages. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The scribe <b>writes two</b> documents <b>for the two</b> parties, one <b>for this</b> one <b>by himself, and</b> one <b>for that</b> one <b>by himself.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>What</b> is meant by: <b>Provided that</b> the scribe <b>recognizes</b> the parties requesting the document? <b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> It means <b>provided that he recognizes the man’s name in the</b> case of <b>the bill of divorce and the woman’s name in</b> the case of <b>the receipt.</b>
The Gemara relates: <b>Rav Safra and Rav Aḥa bar Huna and Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana</b> were <b>sitting, and Abaye</b> was <b>sitting near them. And</b> as <b>they were sitting, they raised a dilemma:</b> Did Rav mean that with regard to <b>the man’s name in the</b> case of <b>bill of divorce bill, yes,</b> it must be known to the scribe, but <b>the woman’s name</b> need <b>not</b> be known to the scribe? And did he mean that with regard to <b>the woman’s name in</b> the case of <b>the receipt, yes,</b> it must be known to the scribe, but <b>the man’s name</b> need <b>not</b> be known to the scribe?
<b>But</b> if so, <b>let</b> there be <b>a concern</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the man who made the request <b>writes the bill of divorce and</b> intends to <b>go and give it to the wife of another</b> man with the same name.
<b>And</b> similarly, in the case of the receipt let there be a concern that there will be <b>times</b> when the <b>woman writes</b> the <b>receipt and</b> intends to <b>give</b> it <b>to a man who is not her</b> husband, whose wife shares her name.
<b>Abaye said to them:</b> You are not understanding Rav’s statement correctly. <b>This</b> is what <b>Rav says: The man’s name in</b> the case of <b>the bill of divorce</b> must be known to the scribe, <b>and the same is true of the woman’s name,</b> which must also be known to the scribe. And <b>the woman’s name in</b> the case of <b>the receipt</b> must be known to the scribe, <b>and the same is true of the man’s name,</b> which must also be known to the scribe.
They continued their line of questioning: <b>And</b> even if both names are known to the scribe, <b>let</b> there be <b>a concern for</b> the possibility of <b>two</b> men with the same name, such as two men named <b>Yosef ben Shimon, who live in one city</b> and whose wives share the same name as well, and <b>perhaps</b> the man who made the request will <b>write the bill of divorce and</b> intend to <b>go and give it to the wife of the other</b> man who bears the same name as him. <b>Rav Aḥa bar Huna said to them</b> in reply that <b>this</b> is what <b>Rav says:</b> If there are <b>two</b> men named <b>Yosef ben Shimon who live in one city</b> and are married to women who share the same name, <b>they may divorce their wives only in the presence of one another.</b>
They continued to ask: <b>But</b> even if the scribe knows the man’s name and the name of the man’s wife, <b>let</b> there be <b>a concern</b> that <b>perhaps</b> someone will <b>go to another city and establish</b> a false <b>name for himself as Yosef ben Shimon, and</b> he <b>will write the bill of divorce and give it to the wife of the other</b> man, whose name really is Yosef ben Shimon.
<b>Rav Huna bar Ḥinnana said to them</b> that <b>this</b> is what <b>Rav says:</b> With regard to <b>anyone whose name has been established in a city</b> for <b>thirty days,</b> there is <b>no concern</b> harbored <b>about him</b> that his name is false. It is assumed that this is his true name.
They continued to ask: <b>What</b> if his name has <b>not</b> been <b>established</b> for thirty days? How can a newcomer in a town have a bill of divorce drawn up for him? <b>Abaye said:</b> It is sufficient <b>that</b> people <b>call him</b> by the name he claims for himself <b>and he responds</b> to that call. <b>Rav Zevid said: A liar is careful about</b> upholding <b>his lies,</b> and just because he responds to being called by a particular name does not prove he is telling the truth. A newcomer would therefore have to wait thirty days before requesting that a scribe write him a bill of divorce.
§ There was <b>a certain receipt</b> of payment of a marriage contract <b>upon which Rav Yirmeya bar Abba was signed</b> as a witness. <b>That woman,</b> whose name matched the name on the receipt, <b>came before</b> Rav Yirmeya, seeking to collect payment of her marriage contract. Rav Yirmeya recognized her name, but not her appearance. The woman <b>said to him: It was not I</b> whose name was on the receipt that you signed, but another woman with the same name; I have not collected payment of my marriage contract. Rav Yirmeya <b>said: I, too, said to</b> the other witnesses signed on the document: The woman for whom we signed the receipt <b>is not she. But they said to me:</b> It is in fact the same woman, but <b>she has aged and her voice has matured</b> and changed, and that is why you do not recognize her.
<b>Abaye said</b> that <b>although the Sages said:</b>

Daf 168a

<b>Once</b> one <b>has stated</b> his testimony <b>he may not then state a revision,</b> this case of Rav Yirmeya is an exception, and he can retract his initial statement in which he supported the woman’s claim. The reason is that <b>it is not the manner of a Torah scholar to be careful</b> about identifying women, for reasons of modesty.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain receipt</b> of payment for a marriage contract <b>upon which Rav Yirmeya bar Abba was signed.</b> A woman whose name appeared on the receipt, who was seeking to collect payment of her marriage contract, <b>said to him: It was not I,</b> but another woman with the same name, who had this receipt written. <b>He said to her: But it was you,</b> and you are lying now. <b>Abaye said: Although</b> I said that <b>it is not the manner of a Torah scholar to</b> be <b>careful</b> about identifying women, <b>once he is careful</b> about such an identification and states positively that he recognizes a particular woman, <b>he is careful.</b>
<b>Abaye said: A Torah scholar who goes to betroth a woman should take an ignoramus with him</b> to establish a positive identity of the woman, <b>lest</b> people <b>exchange</b> another woman for <b>her</b> when given to <b>him</b> for marriage, taking advantage of his innocence.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>the husband gives</b> the scribe’s <b>wages</b> for writing a bill of divorce. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The Gemara answers: <b>As the verse states:</b> “When a man takes a wife and marries her, and it comes to pass, if she finds no favor in his eyes, because he has found some unseemly matter in her, <b>he shall write</b> her a scroll of severance <b>and give</b> it in her hand” (Deuteronomy 24:1). It is therefore the husband’s responsibility to have the bill of divorce written. The Gemara adds: <b>But today,</b> the reason <b>that we do not do so,</b> but instead have the woman pay the scribe, is that <b>the Sages placed</b> the burden <b>upon the woman, so that</b> the husband <b>should not delay</b> the divorce by refusing to pay the scribe.
The mishna teaches: A scribe may <b>write</b> a promissory <b>note for a debtor</b> who requests one, <b>even if</b> the <b>creditor is not with him,</b> and it is the debtor who gives the scribe his wages. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the debtor pays the wages? After all, he is the beneficiary of the loan. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to state this, as there are times when the loan is beneficial to the creditor as well, as <b>in</b> a case of <b>a joint venture,</b> where the creditor receives a share of the profits engendered by the money provided to the borrower (see <i>Bava Metzia</i> 104a).
The mishna teaches: A scribe may <b>write a bill</b> of sale <b>for a seller</b> of property who requests one, <b>even if the purchaser is not with him</b> when he presents his request, and it is the purchaser who provides the scribe’s wages. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the purchaser pays the wages? After all, he is the beneficiary of the sale. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to state this, as sometimes the sale is beneficial to the seller as well, as <b>in</b> a case of <b>one who sells a field because of its poor</b> quality, as he is anxious to be rid of it.
The mishna teaches: A scribe may <b>not write documents of betrothal</b> and documents of marriage except with the consent of both the groom and the bride, and it is the groom who provides the scribe’s wages. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the groom pays the wages? After all, he is the one acquiring his betrothed. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to state this, to teach us <b>that</b> it applies <b>even</b> when the groom is <b>a Torah scholar,</b> in <b>which</b> case <b>it gives his father-in-law satisfaction to bring him into his family</b> by having him marry his daughter. Even in such a case, where the bride’s family is a beneficiary, it is the groom who pays the wages.
The mishna teaches: A scribe may <b>not write contracts for sharecroppers and contractors</b> except with the consent of both parties, i.e., the sharecropper or contractor and the one who hires him, and it is the sharecropper or contractor who provides the scribe’s wages. The Gemara asks: Isn’t it <b>obvious</b> that the contractor pays the wages? After all, the contract details his rights to the field. The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> for the mishna to state this, as sometimes the deal is detrimental to the contractor, as <b>in</b> the case of <b>a fallow</b> field. It might have been thought that in this case the cost of the document is borne by the landowner.
The mishna teaches: A scribe may <b>not write documents</b> testifying to <b>arbitration</b> or any other court enactment <b>except with the consent of both</b> parties to the litigation. The Gemara asks: <b>What</b> is meant by <b>documents</b> testifying to <b>arbitration? Here</b> in Babylonia the Sages <b>interpreted</b> it to mean <b>documents recording the claims</b> of the two parties to the litigation. <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba says:</b> A document testifying to arbitration is one that records the procedure in which the composition of the court is chosen, as described in tractate <i>Sanhedrin</i> (23a), whereby <b>this</b> litigant <b>chooses one</b> judge <b>and that</b> litigant <b>chooses one</b> judge, and these two judges choose the third one.
§ The mishna teaches that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The scribe <b>writes two</b> documents <b>for the two</b> parties, one <b>for this</b> one <b>by himself and</b> one <b>for that</b> one <b>by himself.</b> The Gemara analyzes the disagreement between Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the first <i>tanna</i>, who did not call for two separate documents: <b>Shall we say</b> that they <b>disagree with regard to</b> the principle that the court <b>coerces</b> people to prevent <b>conduct</b> characteristic <b>of Sodom,</b> i.e., selfish behavior? That is, the case is where one of the litigants does not want to contribute to the writing of a joint document, and insists that each litigant pay to have his own document written, which would entail an additional expenditure on the part of the other party.
The dispute is then as follows: <b>As</b> one <b>Sage,</b> the first <i>tanna</i>, <b>holds</b> that the court <b>coerces</b> people to prevent this conduct, so the obstinate litigant is forced to pay his share of a joint document, <b>and</b> one <b>Sage,</b> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, <b>holds</b> that the court does <b>not coerce</b> people to prevent this conduct, and a litigant can insist upon paying only for a document of his own.
The Gemara rejects this analysis: <b>No, everyone</b> in the mishna holds that the court <b>coerces</b> people to prevent conduct characteristic of Sodom, <b>and here this is the reason</b> for the ruling <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel:</b> It is because the litigant demanding separate documents is not making a pointless, selfish request at all, <b>as he says to</b> the other litigant: <b>It is not amenable for me that your defense,</b> i.e., the record of your claims, <b>should be together with my defense, as you are to me like an ambushing lion,</b> i.e., our interests are in conflict.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a debtor <b>who repaid part of his debt and</b> with the agreement of the creditor <b>deposited</b> the promissory <b>note with a third party</b> serving as a trustee to ensure that the creditor would not collect the full amount, <b>and</b> the debtor <b>said to</b> the trustee: <b>If I have not given you</b> the balance <b>from now until such and such a day, give</b> the creditor <b>his</b> promissory <b>note,</b> thereby enabling him to collect the full amount stated on the note, if the stipulated <b>time arrived and</b> the debtor <b>did not give</b> the balance to the trustee, <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The trustee <b>should give</b> the promissory note to the creditor, in accordance with the debtor’s stipulation. <b>Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The trustee <b>should not give</b> it, as the stipulation is void.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> Rabbi Yosei and Rabbi Yehuda <b>disagree? Rabbi Yosei holds</b> that <b>a transaction with inconclusive consent [<i>asmakhta</i>] effects acquisition.</b> In this case, the debtor willingly undertook a penalty if he would not repay the remainder of the debt on time. Yet, he did not think that he would miss the deadline and be held accountable to pay that penalty. Rabbi Yosei holds that he is nevertheless bound by his word. <b>And Rabbi Yehuda holds</b> that <b>an <i>asmakhta</i> does not effect acquisition,</b> i.e., it is not binding.
<b>Rav Naḥman says</b> that <b>Rabba bar Avuh says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. When</b> questioners <b>came before Rabbi Ami,</b> inquiring of him what the <i>halakha</i> is in this matter, <b>he said to them: But since</b> it is the case <b>that Rabbi Yoḥanan taught us a first time and a second</b> time, i.e., repeatedly, that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei, what can I do</b> to contradict his words?
The Gemara concludes: <b>But</b> in fact the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei,</b> i.e., an <i>asmakhta</i> is not binding.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a creditor <b>whose promissory note has become erased,</b> he should <b>produce witnesses</b> who remember the details of the document to testify <b>about it. And</b> they <b>come before the court, and they ratify</b> his promissory note <b>for him,</b> stating: The promissory <b>note of so-and-so was erased,</b> and it stated that a loan for such and such an amount took place <b>on such and such a date,</b>

Daf 168b

<b>and so-and-so and so-and-so were its witnesses.</b> The ratification document is signed, and it may be used as a replacement for the erased document.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>The Sages taught</b> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 1:16): <b>What is</b> the text of <b>the ratification</b> document <b>of</b> an erased document? The court writes as follows: <b>We, so-and-so and so-and-so and so-and-so, were sitting as three</b> judges, and <b>so-and-so, son of so-and-so, produced an erased document before us,</b> which was written <b>on such and such a date, and so-and-so and so-and-so</b> were <b>its witnesses. And if it is written in</b> this ratification document also: <b>We engaged in</b> the investigation of <b>the testimony of the witnesses and their testimony has been found</b> to be <b>congruent,</b> the creditor can <b>collect</b> his debt on the basis of this ratification document, <b>and he does not need to bring</b> further <b>proof. But if</b> this formula is <b>not</b> written, the creditor <b>needs to bring</b> further <b>proof</b> of the loan in order to collect it.
The <i>baraita</i> continues with its discussion of damaged documents: If a promissory note was <b>torn</b> intentionally it is <b>not valid,</b> but if it <b>became torn</b> accidentally it is <b>valid.</b> In a case where it <b>was erased or smudged, if its imprint is recognizable,</b> i.e., if the words are still legible, though barely, it is <b>valid.</b>
The Gemara seeks to clarify the terms in the second part of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>What are the circumstances,</b> i.e., what are the defining characteristics, of a document that was <b>torn,</b> and <b>what are the circumstances</b> of a document that <b>became torn? Rav Yehuda says:</b> A document that was <b>torn</b> means that it had <b>a tear</b> created <b>by the court,</b> because they wished to render it not valid due to payment of the loan or some other circumstance. A document that <b>became torn</b> means it had <b>a tear that</b> was <b>not</b> created <b>by the court.</b>
The Gemara seeks further clarification: <b>What are the circumstances,</b> i.e., what are the signs, of a document that had <b>a tear</b> created <b>by the court? Rav Yehuda says:</b> The document has a tear that ruins <b>the place of the witnesses’</b> signatures <b>and the place of the date and the place of the essential part</b> of a document. <b>Abaye says:</b> It has <b>a tear</b> that goes both <b>lengthwise and widthwise.</b>
§ The Gemara relates: There was once <b>a certain</b> group of <b>Arabs who came to Pumbedita</b> and <b>who would rob people’s land</b> and force the victims to surrender the deeds to their property to prevent subsequent legal action. <b>The owners of</b> land who had not yet had fallen victim to these Arabs <b>came before Abaye</b> and <b>said to him: Let the Master look at our deeds</b> to our property <b>and let the Master write us another deed for it,</b> so <b>that if one</b> of the deeds <b>is robbed we will have</b> the other <b>one in our possession.</b>
Abaye <b>said to them: What can I do for you?</b> I cannot comply with your request, <b>as Rav Safra says:</b> One may <b>not write two deeds</b> of ownership <b>for one field, lest</b> the owner of that land <b>repossess property</b> once <b>and</b> then <b>go back and repossess</b> it once again. Generally, whenever real estate is sold there is a guarantee given to the purchaser in the event that the land is repossessed by the seller’s creditor or by someone else who proves that the land rightfully belongs to him. If the seller of the repossessed land has no money to honor the guarantee, the purchaser can repossess property from others who had purchased property from the same seller subsequent to the sale of the repossessed land. In order to do so, he would have to produce the bill of sale proving that he had purchased the repossessed property. If he has two such deeds, he would be able to collect payment twice. To eliminate this possibility, duplicate property deeds are not written.
The landowners <b>kept badgering</b> Abaye to write the duplicate documents, until, in order to be rid of them, <b>he said to his scribe: Go write</b> the document <b>for them,</b> but first write on paper and then erase it, and then write the desired document over the erased text, so that the text of the document will be written <b>over an erasure, and</b> the signatures of <b>its witnesses</b> will be <b>on</b> a part of <b>the paper</b> where the writing had not been erased, a situation in <b>which</b> the document is <b>not valid.</b>
<b>Rav Aḥa bar Minyumi said to Abaye: But perhaps</b> the first writing on the paper was not erased thoroughly, so <b>its imprint is recognizable, and it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that in a case where the writing on a document <b>was erased or smudged, if its imprint is recognizable,</b> the document is <b>valid.</b> Abaye <b>said to him: Did I say</b> that he should write <b>a proper document</b> and then erase it? <b>I said,</b> i.e., I intended, that he should <b>merely</b> write letters of the <b>alphabet [<i>alef beit</i>],</b> not actual words.
§ <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In a case where one <b>came</b> to court <b>and said: My promissory note was lost, even if witnesses said: We wrote and signed</b> such a promissory note <b>and gave</b> it <b>to</b> this man, the court may <b>not write</b> a new <b>document for him.</b> The Gemara asks: <b>In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? In</b> the case of <b>documents</b> detailing <b>loans. But</b> in a case of <b>deeds of buying and selling</b> land, the court may <b>write</b> a replacement document, <b>excluding the</b> standard <b>guarantee that</b> was <b>in</b> the first document, which states that if the field is repossessed the seller will compensate the purchaser for his loss.

Daf 169a

The <i>baraita</i> continues: <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> The court may <b>not write</b> a replacement document <b>even</b> for <b>deeds of buying and selling</b> land. <b>And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says as well:</b> With regard to <b>one who gives a gift</b> of land <b>to another, and</b> the recipient <b>returned the deed to him, his gift</b> of land <b>returns</b> to him as well. <b>But the Rabbis say: His gift</b> of land <b>remains</b> in the possession of the recipient.
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>The Master says</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: With regard to deeds of buying and selling land, the court may write a replacement document, <b>excluding the guarantee that</b> was <b>in</b> the first document. <b>What is the reason</b> that the guarantee may not be written?
<b>Rav Safra says:</b> It is <b>because</b> the court may <b>not write two deeds</b> of sale <b>for</b> the same sale of <b>one field, lest a creditor</b> of the seller <b>go</b> and <b>repossess</b> the field sold <b>to this</b> purchaser, <b>and that</b> purchaser <b>go and take out one</b> deed, <b>and</b> in accordance with the guarantee clause of the sale, <b>repossess</b> land from other <b>purchasers</b> who purchased land from the same seller at a later date, <b>and say to the creditor: Remain quiet [<i>shof</i> ]</b> about this matter for a few years, <b>while I become established in</b> the property I repossessed. <b>And then, come</b> and claim your loan again, and then you will <b>repossess</b> this property <b>from me. And</b> then, after it is taken from him a second time, the purchaser will then <b>take out the other</b> document of sale, the replacement that the court had written for him, <b>and then go</b> and <b>repossess</b> land from <b>other purchasers</b> who purchased land from the same seller. In short, a replacement document with a guarantee will enable double collection on that guarantee.
The Gemara asks with regard to Rav Safra’s scenario: How would it be possible for this to occur? <b>But once</b> the creditor repossessed the land the first time as payment of the debt, <b>we,</b> the court, <b>tore the</b> promissory <b>note of</b> the seller’s <b>creditor; with what</b> document could the creditor <b>repossess</b> the purchaser’s land <b>again?</b>
<b>And if you would say that we did not tear</b> the creditor’s promissory note in the course of the first collection, that cannot be. <b>But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say</b> that <b>any</b> document of <b>authorization to repossess</b> liened property from its purchaser <b>in which it is not written: We have torn the creditor’s</b> promissory <b>note, is not</b> a valid document of <b>authorization to repossess</b> liened property; <b>and any document of authorization</b> used <b>to</b> seize a debtor’s property <b>in which it is not written: We have torn the</b> creditor’s document of <b>authorization to repossess</b> liened property, <b>is not</b> a valid <b>document of authorization; and any document of appraisal</b> of an article’s value <b>in which it is not written: We have torn</b> the creditor’s <b>document of authorization, is not</b> a valid <b>document of appraisal.</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>No,</b> it is <b>necessary</b> to explain Rav Safra’s case as follows: The concern is not that a creditor will repossess the field, but <b>that</b> someone will <b>come</b> to repossess it <b>based on</b> his claim to the land as the property of <b>his ancestors.</b> That is, he proved that the field had belonged to his ancestors, and by extension belongs to himself as their heir, and the one who sold the field was in fact a thief. It was for this reason that he repossessed the field from the purchaser, and the concern is that the purchaser will seek reimbursement, as stipulated in the guarantee, from other property sold subsequently by the seller. If the purchaser has two deeds of sale with guarantees, he can collect payment twice.
The Gemara presents another question pertaining to Rav Safra’s case. <b>Rav Aḥa of Difti said to Ravina: And why did</b> Rav Safra have <b>to</b> include in his case that the purchaser will <b>say to the creditor: Remain quiet</b> about this matter for a few years <b>while I become established in this land</b> I repossessed, and then come and claim your loan again? Why did he devise a case in which the seller’s creditor collects payment twice? Let the problem <b>derive</b> from the fact <b>that since</b> the purchaser <b>holds two deeds</b> he will be able to <b>repossess</b> land based on his guarantee once <b>and</b> then <b>repossess</b> land <b>again,</b> even if the creditor does not collect his debt twice.
Ravina answered: <b>If so,</b> if the purchaser attempts to repossess land twice based on a single repossession of the creditor, <b>he will have</b> too <b>many litigants</b> to deal with at once, and his dishonest dealings will be discovered.
The Gemara asks further: <b>But let</b> the court <b>write a proper bill</b> of sale, one that includes a guarantee, <b>for this</b> purchaser, <b>and</b> then <b>let</b> the court <b>write a receipt for the seller,</b> stating: <b>All documents that are issued with regard to</b> the purchase of <b>this field are not valid, except for</b> the one <b>issued on this date,</b> referring to the replacement document written by the court. This will prevent double collection, as if the purchaser attempts to collect on his guarantee with a second document, the seller will foil this attempt by showing this receipt.
<b>The Rabbis said before Rav Pappa</b> in response to this question, <b>and some say</b> it was said <b>before Rav Ashi: Is that to say</b> that the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> holds that in general the court does <b>not write a receipt</b> in such cases?

Daf 169b

Rav Pappa or Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> them: Do not draw this conclusion. It is possible that the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> holds that <b>generally</b> the court <b>writes a receipt</b> when a creditor has lost his promissory note. <b>And here, this is the reason</b> that it does not write a receipt: <b>As, perhaps the creditor,</b> i.e., the one from whom the property was stolen, will <b>go and repossess</b> property <b>from the purchaser</b> who bought the stolen land, <b>and</b> the purchaser, seeking reimbursement in accordance with the guarantee, will <b>go and repossess</b> property from other <b>purchasers</b> who had later bought property from the same seller. <b>And the receipt</b> will not help, because it <b>is not with the purchasers</b> who bought property from the seller, but is in the possession of the seller himself. The purchasers, who are the ones who will suffer from the double collection, have no protection; they will in fact not even be aware that they are the victims of a double collection.
The Gemara asks: <b>Ultimately, don’t</b> these <b>purchasers go back to the owner,</b> i.e., the seller, <b>of the land</b> to demand reimbursement? At that point the seller will produce the receipt, exposing the double collection, and the entire process will be reversed, so that ultimately the purchaser who suffered from the unjust collection will obtain possession of his property.
The Gemara answers: While it is true that ultimately the deception will be discovered, <b>in the interim,</b> between the time the land was unjustly repossessed from the purchaser and the time when the injustice is reversed, the one who repossessed the land <b>seizes</b> the land <b>and consumes</b> its <b>produce,</b> i.e., he enjoys the profits produced by the land, and it will be difficult to receive full reimbursement for this stolen produce.
<b>Alternatively,</b> the reason the option of writing a receipt for the seller of the land is not pursued here is that there is a concern <b>about one who purchases</b> land <b>without a guarantee.</b> As such a purchaser knows that he has no recourse to be reimbursed from the seller if the land he bought is repossessed, he will never contact the seller and discover that the seller has a receipt and that he has been the victim of an unjust double collection.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> the same concern should be taken into consideration in the case of <b>promissory notes as well.</b> And yet Rav Pappa, or Rav Ashi, said that the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> concedes that a receipt may be written for the debtor to enable the collection of a debt in the event of the loss of the promissory note. Why are the aforementioned concerns not applicable to the case of debt collection?
The Gemara answers: <b>There, where</b> the debtor <b>owes money,</b> when the creditor seeks to repossess sold land, the purchaser of that land <b>will say</b> to himself: There is a possibility that the debtor <b>appeased the creditor by</b> paying him <b>money,</b> since debts are usually settled with money. I will therefore investigate the matter with the debtor before allowing the creditor to repossess my land. At that point the receipt, held by the debtor, will be discovered, and double collection will be prevented. <b>Here, where he owes land,</b> as the issue is that the claim is based on reimbursement for having bought stolen land, the purchaser <b>knows that</b> it is <b>not</b> common for one <b>who</b> is <b>owed land</b> to be <b>appeased with money</b> in such cases. The purchaser will therefore allow his land to be repossessed and will seek reimbursement at a later time.
§ The Gemara returns to the <i>baraita</i> and analyzes one of its statements. <b>The Master says</b> in the <i>baraita</i>: With regard to deeds of buying and selling land, the court may write a replacement document, <b>excluding the guarantee that</b> was <b>in</b> the first document that if the field is repossessed the seller will compensate the purchaser for his loss. <b>How do we write</b> a bill of sale in such a way that it does not include this guarantee? <b>Rav Naḥman said</b> that the case is one in <b>which</b> the court <b>writes as follows: Our deed is not</b> intended <b>to enable</b> the <b>collection</b> of reimbursement in event of repossession, <b>neither</b> collection <b>from liened</b> property that has been sold <b>nor</b> collection <b>from unsold</b> property; <b>rather,</b> it is intended merely to ensure <b>that the land is established in the possession of the purchaser.</b>
<b>Rafram says: This</b> statement of Rav Naḥman serves <b>to say</b> that the omission of the <b>guarantee</b> of the sale from a document <b>is a scribal error.</b> That is, it is assumed that when one purchases land he expects to have his purchase guaranteed, and that if such a clause is not stated in the document it is presumed to be a mere scribal oversight, and a guarantee is in effect. Rav Naḥman said, in explaining the <i>baraita</i>, that <b>the</b> only <b>reason</b> a land purchase would not have a guarantee <b>is that</b> the scribe <b>wrote this for him,</b> i.e., he wrote that there is no guarantee, explicitly in the deed; <b>this</b> indicates that if the scribe <b>did not write this</b> explicitly <b>for</b> the purchaser, but left out the subject of the guarantee altogether, the purchaser <b>would</b> nevertheless have the guarantee and would be able to <b>collect</b> reimbursement from the seller in the event of repossession.
<b>Rav Ashi</b> disagrees and <b>says:</b> The omission of the <b>guarantee</b> of the sale from a document <b>is not a scribal error.</b> Accordingly, if mention of a guarantee is omitted from a bill of sale, there is in fact no guarantee. <b>And what</b> does the <i>baraita</i> mean when it says: <b>Excluding the guarantee that</b> was <b>in</b> the first document? It means simply <b>that</b> in this case there was <b>no</b> clause about a <b>guarantee written in it</b> at all.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain woman who gave money to a certain man to</b> act as her agent and <b>purchase land for her.</b> The agent <b>went</b> and <b>purchased</b> land <b>for her,</b> but he conducted the purchase in such a way that it was <b>without a guarantee.</b> The woman wanted to take action against the agent and <b>came before Rav Naḥman</b> to ask what recourse she had.
Rav Naḥman <b>said to</b> the agent: The principle with regard to an agent is that if he acts to the detriment of the one who appointed him, the one who appointed him can say: <b>I sent you</b> to act <b>for my benefit and not to my detriment.</b> Therefore, the entire agency is null and void, thereby negating the purchase. Nevertheless, you agreed to purchase the land without a guarantee. Therefore, <b>go</b> yourself and <b>purchase</b> the land <b>from him without a guarantee, and then sell it to</b> this woman <b>with a guarantee</b> that you will reimburse her in the event the land is repossessed.
§ The <i>baraita</i> teaches that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> In the case of <b>one who gives a gift</b> of land <b>to another, and</b> the recipient <b>returned the deed to him, his gift</b> of land <b>returns</b> to him as well. <b>But the Rabbis say: His gift</b> of land <b>remains</b> in the possession of the recipient. The Gemara asks: <b>What is the reason</b> for the opinion <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel? Rav Asi says: It becomes as</b> if the giver <b>said to</b> the recipient: <b>This field is given to you</b> only <b>as long as the deed</b> remains <b>in your possession.</b> Therefore, by returning the deed to the giver, the recipient is canceling the gift.
<b>Rabba objects to this: If that is so</b> that these are the conditions of the gift, then when the deed is <b>stolen</b> from <b>or lost</b> by the recipient, the gift should <b>also</b> be canceled.
<b>Rather, Rabba said</b> a different explanation: Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and the Rabbis <b>disagree about</b> whether or not the <b>letters,</b> i.e., the contents of a promissory note, <b>are acquired by</b> merely <b>transferring</b> the document from one holder of the document to another. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds</b> that the <b>letters are acquired by transferring</b> the document. Therefore, if the recipient returns the bill of sale to the giver, the land returns to the giver as well. <b>And the Rabbis hold</b> that the <b>letters are not acquired by transferring</b> the document.
<b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: With regard to <b>one who comes</b> to court <b>to be judged</b> over a claim that land that is in his possession belongs to another, if he claims ownership <b>based on a deed,</b> i.e., a bill of sale, <b>and</b> claims further that he is the owner <b>based on presumptive ownership</b> of the land, as it was in his uncontested possession for three years, and he therefore does not need the deed as proof, his claim is <b>judged based on</b> the <b>deed.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says:</b> His claim is judged <b>based on</b> his <b>presumptive ownership.</b>
The Gemara analyzes the <i>baraita</i>: <b>With regard to what do</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel <b>disagree? When Rav Dimi came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia he <b>said: They disagree</b> about whether or not <b>letters are acquired by transferring</b> the document from one holder of the document to another.

Daf 170a

The Gemara explains: This is a case where one party sold land to another, who then sold it to a third party by transferring the bill of sale to him. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds</b> that the <b>letters are not acquired by transferring</b> possession of the document. Handing the bill to the third party is therefore not a valid act of acquisition. In order to establish that the land is his, one must prove presumptive ownership by demonstrating that he has lived in the land uncontested for three years. <b>And Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that the <b>letters are acquired by transferring</b> possession of the document. Therefore, if the third party produces the bill of sale that had been transferred to him, this is sufficient proof that the land is his.
<b>Abaye</b> objected and <b>said to</b> Rav Dimi: <b>If that is so,</b> that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds that letters are not acquired by transferring possession of the bill of sale, this would be in <b>disagreement with</b> what <b>the Master,</b> Rabba, said earlier, that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel maintains that letters are acquired by transferring possession of the bill of sale. Rav Dimi <b>said</b> back <b>to him: And let it be in disagreement.</b> I am not obligated to be in agreement with Rabba.
Abaye clarified his objection and <b>said to him: This is what I</b> meant to <b>say to you. The <i>baraita</i></b> (168b), which Rabba was explaining, <b>can be explained only</b> the way the <b>Master,</b> Rabba, <b>explained</b> it. <b>And if so,</b> i.e., if you do not agree with Rabba’s understanding of the opinion of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, there is <b>a difficulty,</b> as there is a contradiction <b>between</b> one statement <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel and</b> the other statement <b>of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b>
<b>Rather, Abaye said</b> that the explanation of the <i>baraita</i> concerning one who appears before a court to be judged is as follows: <b>With what are we dealing here?</b> We are dealing with a case <b>where one of</b> the witnesses signed on the bill <b>was found to be a relative</b> to one of the parties, <b>or</b> he was found to be <b>disqualified</b> from bearing witness for another reason, and therefore the document is rendered invalid.
Abaye continues: <b>And</b> the two opinions in the <i>baraita</i> disagree <b>with regard to</b> the issue that is the subject of <b>the dispute between Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Elazar. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, who says: The witnesses of the transmission</b> of the document <b>effect</b> the transaction, meaning that witnesses are not required to be signed on a document at all, provided that there are witnesses who saw the transfer of the document to the relevant party. It is therefore inconsequential that one of the witnesses that signed the document is disqualified. This is why Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi says that the claim is judged based on the deed, i.e., the deed is valid.
<b>And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: The signatory witnesses</b> on the document <b>effect</b> the transaction, meaning that it is necessary for a document to have witnesses sign it. If there are no witnesses or if one or both of them are disqualified, the document is not valid even if its transmission is witnessed by qualified witnesses. This is why Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that the claim is judged based on the claimant’s presumptive ownership; this is his only valid proof since the deed he possesses is not valid.
The Gemara objects to Abaye’s explanation: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Abba say</b> that <b>Rabbi Elazar concedes</b> that <b>in</b> the case of a document whose <b>falsification is inherent in it that it is not valid?</b> Rabbi Elazar said only that a document that has no witnesses signed on it at all is valid if its transmission was witnessed. If the document has disqualified witnesses, he agrees it is not valid.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Avina said</b> a modification of Abaye’s explanation. <b>All concede that if it is written in</b> the document: <b>We,</b> the court, <b>engaged in</b> an investigation of <b>the testimony of the witnesses</b> and have determined that they signed the document, <b>and their testimony was found</b> to be <b>false,</b> the document <b>is not valid, in accordance with</b> the statement <b>of Rabbi Abba. They disagree only with regard to a document upon which there are no witnesses</b> signed <b>at all. As Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Elazar, who says: The witnesses of the transmission</b> of the document <b>effect</b> the transaction. Signatory witnesses are not necessary, and the deed can therefore be used as proof. <b>And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Meir, who says: The signatory witnesses</b> on the document <b>effect</b> the transaction, so the deed cannot be used. Therefore, the only valid proof would be based on his presumptive ownership.
The Gemara suggests: <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: The case in the <i>baraita</i> is one where the alleged purchaser has a bill of sale for the land, but the alleged seller, although he admits that the document was written with his consent, claims that the sale did not ultimately occur, and that the alleged purchaser took the document from him. And the <i>tanna’im</i> in the <i>baraita</i> <b>disagree, with regard to</b> the <i>halakha</i> in the case of a debtor <b>who admits that he wrote</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> whether the creditor <b>is required to ratify it</b> in court in order to collect, and, by extension, in a case where a seller admits that he wrote a bill of sale, whether the purchaser must ratify it in court in order to establish its validity.
<b>As, Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that in the case of a debtor <b>who admits that he wrote</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>is not required to ratify it</b> in court in order to collect what is owed to him. In this case as well, the purchaser can use the bill of sale as proof that he is the rightful owner of the property. <b>And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds</b> that in the case of a debtor who admits that he wrote a promissory note, the creditor <b>is required to ratify it</b> in court in order to use it to collect the debt. In this case as well, since the purchaser is unable to ratify it, his only recourse to prove his ownership is showing that he lived in the land uncontested for three years.
The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we hear the opposite concerning</b> Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Metzia</i> 1:8) that if <b>two</b> people, the debtor and the creditor, <b>are grasping</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> and the <b>creditor says: It is mine,</b> i.e., the debt has not yet been paid, <b>and it fell from me, and you,</b> the debtor, <b>found it, and</b> the <b>debtor says: It is</b> in fact <b>yours,</b> i.e., I did borrow the money from you, <b>but I paid you</b> and was given the promissory note, and it fell from me, and you found it, <b>the</b> promissory <b>note must be ratified through its signatories,</b> even though the debtor admits it is a valid document. <b>This is the statement of Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi. <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: They should divide</b> the amount written in the promissory note, i.e., the debtor must pay half of the recorded sum to the creditor.
The Gemara explains: <b>And we discussed it</b> once before and asked the following question about it: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi agree to <b>that which we learned</b> in a mishna (<i>Bava Metzia</i> 2a), with regard to <b>two</b> people who came to court <b>holding a garment,</b> where <b>this</b> one is <b>saying: I found it, and that</b> one is <b>saying: I found it;</b> that <b>this</b> one <b>takes an oath that he does not have</b> claim to <b>less than half of it, and that</b> one <b>takes an oath that he does not have</b> claim to <b>less than half of it, and they divide</b> it? Why does Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi not maintain that in a case where the debtor and creditor are grasping a promissory note, there too they should divide the money?
<b>And</b> in response to this question <b>Rava said</b> that <b>Rav Naḥman said: In</b> the case of <b>a ratified</b> promissory note, <b>everyone agrees that they should divide</b> it. <b>Where they disagree</b> is <b>in</b> the case of a note <b>that is not ratified. Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>holds</b> that in the case of a debtor <b>who admits that he wrote</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>is required to ratify it</b> in court in order to collect the debt from him. <b>And if he</b> successfully <b>ratifies it,</b> the creditor <b>collects half</b> of the recorded sum, since the two parties are contesting ownership of the document. <b>And if</b> he is <b>not</b> successful in ratifying the note, it <b>is merely a shard,</b> i.e., a worthless piece of paper.
<b>And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds</b> that in the case of a debtor <b>who admits that he wrote</b> a promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>is not required to ratify it</b> in court in order to collect payment. Since the note is valid and fit for collection, <b>they should divide</b> it, i.e., the creditor collects half the sum, as the ownership of the document is contested. The positions of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel are therefore the reverse of what the Gemara proposed in its explanation of the first <i>baraita</i>.
The Gemara answers: <b>Reverse</b> the way the opinions of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel are recorded in one of the two <i>baraitot</i> so that they are consistent in both <i>baraitot</i>.
<b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>Actually, do not reverse</b> their opinions. There is no contradiction between them, because the issue in the first <i>baraita</i> is not whether or not a bill of sale must be ratified when the seller admits that he wrote it. <b>Rather, here</b> the <i>tanna’im</i> <b>disagree with regard to verifying,</b> i.e., they disagree about whether a litigant is required to verify all his claims in circumstances where his case is strong enough to have the court rule in his favor even if they were to disregard some of his claims. Generally, if one has evidence of presumptive ownership of a field he does not have to produce a bill of sale for it. Here, Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi holds that since the one occupying the land claims that he has a bill of sale, he must verify this claim by producing it. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel holds that he is not required to produce it, as the claim of presumptive ownership suffices.
The Gemara explains: It is <b>like this</b> case <b>where Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef was owed money by Rabbi Abba.</b> The case <b>came before Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa.</b> Rabbi Abba <b>said: I</b> already <b>repaid you</b> the debt <b>in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so. Rabbi Yitzḥak</b> Nappaḥa <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba: The witnesses you have named, <b>so-and-so and so-and-so, must come and testify</b> that they saw you repay the loan. Rabbi Abba <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa: <b>If they do not come, am I not deemed credible</b> to say that I repaid the loan? <b>But don’t we maintain</b> that with regard to <b>one who lends</b> money <b>to another in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> the debtor <b>need not repay him in</b> the presence of <b>witnesses,</b> as he is deemed credible to say he repaid the debt even with no supporting testimony?
Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>With regard to this</b> issue, <b>I hold like the <i>halakha</i></b> said <b>by the Master,</b> i.e., you yourself. <b>As Rabbi Abba says</b> that <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava said</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> If <b>one says to another,</b> i.e., if a debtor says to his creditor: <b>I repaid you in the presence of so-and-so and so-and-so,</b> it is <b>required that so-and-so and so-and-so come</b> to court <b>and testify</b> that they witnessed the repayment. Rabbi Abba <b>said to</b> Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa: <b>But doesn’t Rav Giddel say</b> that <b>Rav says</b> that the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with the statement of Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel,</b> that it is not required that a litigant verify all his stated claims if his case is sufficiently strong without those claims? <b>And</b> moreover, <b>even Rabbi</b> Yehuda HaNasi <b>did not</b>

Daf 170b

<b>say</b> that the litigant loses the case if he cannot produce verification of his extraneous claims, but <b>only</b> that he is told <b>to verify</b> those claims if he can. Rabbi Yitzḥak Nappaḥa <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>I, too, am saying</b> only that you are required <b>to verify</b> your claim if you can; if you cannot, you will not be required to pay.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of a debtor <b>who repaid part of his debt, Rabbi Yehuda says:</b> The creditor <b>should exchange</b> the promissory note for a new one stating the current balance and tear up the first promissory note. <b>Rabbi Yosei says:</b> The creditor may keep the original promissory note, and he <b>should write a receipt</b> for the payment he has received and give it to the debtor as proof of his partial payment of the sum recorded in the old note. <b>Rabbi Yehuda said</b> with regard to this arrangement: It is <b>found</b> that <b>this</b> debtor <b>must</b> now <b>guard his receipt against</b> being destroyed by <b>mice,</b> as if he no longer has the receipt, he will have to pay the entire sum recorded in the promissory note. <b>Rabbi Yosei said to him: This</b> situation is <b>fitting for him;</b> it is better that this procedure be followed, <b>and the strength of</b> the claim of <b>this</b> creditor <b>not be weakened.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>not in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yehuda, nor</b> is it <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yosei. Rather,</b> the <i>halakha</i> is that <b>the court tears up the</b> original promissory <b>note and writes a different</b> promissory <b>note for</b> the creditor, listing the new sum owed, dated <b>from the time</b> of the <b>first</b> document.
<b>Rav Naḥman said to Rav Huna, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yirmeya bar Abba</b> who said this <b>to Rav Huna: If Rav would have heard this</b> following <b><i>baraita</i>, as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> that according to Rabbi Yehuda the proper procedure is that the <b>witnesses tear the</b> original promissory <b>note and write another</b> promissory <b>note for</b> the creditor listing the new sum owed, dated <b>from the time</b> of the <b>first</b> document, <b>he would have retracted</b> his statement that the court tears the promissory note and writes a new one.
Rav Huna <b>said to him:</b> Rav <b>heard</b> the <i>baraita</i>, <b>and</b> nevertheless <b>he did not retract</b> his statement. While Rabbi Yehuda says in the <i>baraita</i> that the witnesses write a new promissory note, Rav maintains that this must be done specifically by a court. Why is this?

Daf 171a

<b>Granted, a court</b> can write a new document, because the court <b>has the power to confiscate money.</b> A creditor has the right to seize any property that the debtor had owned on the day the promissory note was written, even if that property was subsequently sold to others; the earlier the date on the note, the more properties it applies to. By dating the new document on the date of the original document the creditor is once again given the right to seize properties from those who had purchased land from the debtor in between the date of the original loan and the date the new promissory note is actually written. The court has such confiscatory power. <b>But</b> with regard to <b>witnesses, who</b> already <b>performed their agency,</b> i.e., fulfilled their assigned role, the first time they wrote the promissory note, can <b>they return and perform their agency</b> again by writing a second promissory note?
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> is it so that witnesses are <b>not</b> empowered to do so? <b>But doesn’t Rav Yehuda say</b> that <b>Rav says: Witnesses</b> who were commissioned to write a deed for the transfer of property <b>may write even ten deeds for one field?</b> If the original deed is lost or destroyed, the witnesses may write a replacement deed for the purchaser, even if the deed is lost many times.
<b>Rav Yosef says</b> an answer to this question: Rav Yehuda’s statement was concerning <b>a deed of gift,</b> not a bill of sale. A gift of land has no guarantee; if it is repossessed from the recipient by the giver’s creditor to repay the giver’s debt, the recipient has no recourse and cannot collect any money from anyone. Therefore, in this case no one is jeopardized by the writing of many replacement deeds, which are intended only to serve as a proof that the recipient is actually entitled to the land.
<b>And Rabba says:</b> It is possible to say that Rav Yehuda’s statement applied even <b>with regard to a bill</b> of sale <b>that does not have a guarantee in it.</b> In that case as well, there is no potential loss to any purchasers of land. By contrast, in the case of a promissory note, which can be used to repossess property from those who have purchased land from the debtor, witnesses do not have the authority to predate a document and thereby subject more purchasers to possible land seizures due to the predating of the document.
The Gemara cited an excerpt from a <i>baraita</i> earlier. It now cites it in full: <b>What</b> is the full text of the <b><i>baraita</i>? As it is taught:</b> If <b>one thousand dinars are owed by</b> a debtor, and the debt is recorded in a promissory note, <b>and</b> the debtor <b>repaid five hundred dinars out of</b> the total, the <b>witnesses tear the</b> original promissory <b>note and write another</b> promissory <b>note for him,</b> dated <b>from</b> the <b>time of</b> the <b>first</b> note. This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei says: This</b> original promissory <b>note shall remain in its place,</b> in the custody of the creditor, <b>and</b> witnesses <b>write a receipt</b> for the five hundred dinars that were repaid. This receipt is given to the debtor to protect himself against a possible attempt by the creditor to use the promissory note to collect the entire one thousand dinars.
Rabbi Yosei continues: <b>And</b> there are <b>two reasons why</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that <b>they write a receipt,</b> as opposed to writing a new promissory note: <b>One</b> reason is <b>so that</b> the creditor <b>can coerce</b> the debtor <b>to repay him,</b> i.e., the psychological pressure for the debtor of knowing that the creditor has a promissory note with a larger amount listed than what he owes him will induce the debtor to repay the remainder promptly. <b>And</b> the other <b>one</b> is <b>so that he,</b> the creditor, <b>should</b> be able to <b>collect</b> liened property <b>from</b> the <b>first date,</b> that of the original document.
The Gemara asks with regard to Rabbi Yosei’s second reason: <b>But doesn’t Rabbi Yehuda also say</b> that the new document must be dated <b>from</b> the <b>time of</b> the <b>first</b> document? The Gemara answers: Rabbi Yosei did not hear a full explanation of Rabbi Yehuda’s opinion; he heard only that Rabbi Yehuda prescribed writing a new promissory note recording the new balance. And <b>this</b> is what <b>Rabbi Yosei is saying to Rabbi Yehuda: If you</b> mean to <b>say</b> that the new promissory note is dated <b>from</b> the <b>time of</b> the <b>first</b> document, <b>I disagree with you on one</b> count, as I hold a receipt should be written to pressure the debtor. <b>If</b> you mean to say that the second promissory note is dated <b>from</b> the <b>second date,</b> i.e., from when the second promissory note was written, <b>I disagree with you on two</b> counts.
§ The Gemara discusses a related <i>halakha</i>. <b>The Sages taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Makkot</i> 1:3): If there is a promissory <b>note whose date is written as a Shabbat or as the tenth of Tishrei,</b> i.e., Yom Kippur, it <b>is</b> assumed to be <b>a postdated</b> promissory <b>note,</b> as writing is forbidden on Shabbat and Yom Kippur, <b>and it is</b> therefore <b>valid.</b> This is <b>the statement of Rabbi Yehuda. Rabbi Yosei deems</b> the promissory note <b>invalid. Rabbi Yehuda said to</b> Rabbi Yosei: <b>But didn’t</b> such <b>an incident come before you in Tzippori, and you</b> yourself <b>deemed</b> the promissory note <b>valid?</b> Rabbi Yosei <b>said to him: When I deemed</b> the promissory note <b>valid,</b> it was <b>in</b> a case like <b>this,</b> where the date was a Shabbat or Yom Kippur, that <b>I deemed</b> it <b>valid.</b>
The Gemara is puzzled by Rabbi Yosei’s response at the end of the <i>baraita</i>: <b>But Rabbi Yehuda was also speaking in</b> a case like <b>this,</b> where the date was a Shabbat or Yom Kippur, and yet Rabbi Yosei’s opinion was that the promissory note is invalid.
<b>Rabbi Pedat says: All</b> parties to this dispute <b>agree that if we engaged in</b> an investigation of <b>the date of the document, and its date was found to be exactly on Shabbat or on the tenth of Tishrei,</b> that it is self-evident <b>that it is a postdated</b> promissory <b>note and is valid.</b>

Daf 171b

The two Sages <b>disagree only with regard to</b> a case of <b>a postdated</b> promissory <b>note in general,</b> i.e., one in which the fact that it is postdated is not readily discernible from the dating of the document, as opposed to one dated on Shabbat or Yom Kippur.
<b>As Rabbi Yehuda</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as he says:</b> One does <b>not write a receipt</b> for a debtor when he pays his debt; rather, the original document is torn, and in the case of partial repayment a new document is written, attesting to the balance due. <b>And</b> consequently, <b>no harm can emerge from</b> a postdated document. There is no concern that the date on the postdated document may have been recorded after the writing of a receipt.
<b>And Rabbi Yosei</b> conforms <b>to his</b> line of <b>reasoning, as he says:</b> One <b>writes a receipt</b> for a debtor when he pays his debt, in lieu of tearing the promissory note. <b>And</b> consequently, <b>harm can emerge from</b> a postdated promissory note. Harm can occur in a case such as the following: The loan was given on the first of Nisan. The debt was paid on the following day and, rather than tearing the promissory note, a receipt was written and dated on the second of Nisan. If the original note had been postdated to the third of Nisan or thereafter, the creditor could use it to collect his debt a second time, arguing that the debtor’s receipt is irrelevant, as its date is prior to the date in the promissory note.
§ <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, says: Even according to the one who says</b> that one <b>writes a receipt</b> for the debtor when he pays, in lieu of tearing the promissory note, <b>this statement</b> applies only <b>with regard to</b> a case where the debtor pays <b>half,</b> i.e., a portion, of the debt. <b>But with regard to</b> a case where the debtor comes to repay <b>all of</b> the debt and the creditor has lost the promissory note and cannot tear it, all agree that one does <b>not</b> write a receipt. Rather, the debtor will not be required to repay the loan unless the creditor can produce the promissory note.
The Gemara rejects this opinion: <b>But it is not so; we write</b> a receipt <b>even in</b> a case where the debtor pays <b>all of</b> the debt.
The Gemara proves its assertion: This is <b>like that</b> case <b>where Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef was owed money by Rabbi Abba.</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef <b>came before Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi,</b> and <b>said to</b> Rabbi Abba: <b>Give me my money.</b> Rabbi Abba <b>said to him:</b> First <b>give me my</b> promissory <b>note, and</b> then <b>take your money.</b> Rav Yitzḥak bar Yosef <b>said to him: I lost your</b> promissory <b>note;</b> instead, <b>I will write a receipt for you.</b> Rabbi Abba <b>said to him: Isn’t</b> there the opinion of <b>Rav and Shmuel, who both say</b> that the <i>halakha</i> is that one does <b>not write a receipt?</b>
Rabbi Ḥanina bar Pappi, the judge, thereupon <b>said: Who will give us</b> some <b>of the dust of Rav and Shmuel,</b> and <b>I will place it on my eyes,</b> so highly do I regard them. Nevertheless, <b>isn’t</b> there the opinion of <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Reish Lakish, who both say</b> that one <b>writes a receipt?</b>
<b>And similarly, when Ravin came</b> from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, he said that <b>Rabbi Ilai says:</b> The <i>halakha</i> is that one <b>writes a receipt.</b>
The Gemara concludes: <b>And it stands to reason that</b> one <b>writes a receipt. As, if</b> it would <b>enter your mind that</b> one does <b>not write a receipt,</b> then <b>if the</b> promissory <b>note of this</b> creditor <b>is lost, should this</b> debtor <b>eat and rejoice?</b> Is it fair that he should keep money that he knows he owes the creditor?
<b>Abaye objects to this</b> line of reasoning: <b>Rather, what</b> should the <i>halakha</i> be, that one <b>writes a receipt</b> when the creditor cannot find the promissory note? If <b>the receipt of</b> the debtor <b>is lost, should this</b> creditor <b>eat and rejoice?</b> Once the debtor has lost his receipt, there is nothing to prevent the creditor from collecting the debt a second time. This, too, is unfair. In either case, whether a receipt is written or not, an injustice could result. Why should it be preferred that the potential of suffering an injustice should be borne by the debtor rather than the creditor? <b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>Yes,</b> it is preferable, because, as it is written: <b>“The borrower is a servant to the lender”</b> (Proverbs 22:7). The debtor’s interests are subordinated to those of the creditor.
§ <b>We learned</b> in a mishna <b>elsewhere</b> (<i>Shevi’it</i> 10:5): <b>Promissory notes that are antedated are not valid, but</b> those <b>that are postdated are valid.</b>
<b>Rav Hamnuna says: They taught</b> this <i>halakha</i> <b>only</b> with regard to <b>promissory notes, but</b> with regard to <b>deeds of buying and selling</b> property, <b>even postdated</b> documents <b>are not valid. What is the reason</b> for this stringency in the case of bills of sale? If postdated documents were allowed, there could be <b>times that</b> the seller <b>sells land to</b> the purchaser <b>in</b> the month of <b>Nisan</b> of a particular year <b>and writes</b> a postdated deed <b>for him</b> stating that the sale took place <b>in</b> the following <b>Tishrei, and</b> some <b>money happens to</b> reach the seller <b>between</b> Nisan and Tishrei <b>and he purchases</b> the land back <b>from</b> the purchaser. <b>And</b> then, <b>when Tishrei arrives,</b> the purchaser <b>takes out</b> the original bill of sale <b>and says to</b> the seller: It is true that you purchased the field from me, but <b>I then purchased it from you</b> again now, in Tishrei, as stated in this document.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so,</b> a similar scenario could occur with <b>promissory notes as well:</b> There could be <b>times that one borrows</b> money <b>in Nisan and writes</b> a promissory <b>note for</b> the creditor stating that the loan took place <b>in</b> the following <b>Tishrei, and</b> some <b>money happens to</b> reach the debtor <b>between</b> Nisan and Tishrei <b>and he repays</b> his debt <b>to</b> the creditor early <b>and says to him: Give me my</b> promissory <b>note. And</b> the creditor <b>says to him: I lost</b> it, <b>and he writes him a receipt</b> instead. <b>And</b> then, <b>when the time</b> written in the note <b>arrives,</b> the creditor <b>takes out</b> the supposedly lost promissory note <b>and says to</b> the debtor: It is true that you repaid me previously, but <b>it is now,</b> after you repaid that loan, <b>that you borrowed from me these</b> dinars recorded in this document, which is dated in Tishrei.
The Gemara answers: Rav Hamnuna <b>holds that</b> one does <b>not write a receipt,</b> so that scenario cannot occur. Like Rabbi Yehuda, Rav Hamnuna maintains that if a creditor loses his promissory note the debtor does not have to repay the loan. Rabbi Yosei, who does allow the creditor to collect his debt in such a case and write a receipt for the debtor, is concerned about that scenario, and consequently he holds that postdated promissory notes are not valid.
<b>Rav Yeimar said to Rav Kahana, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Yirmeya of Difti</b> who said this <b>to Rav Kahana: And today, when we write postdated</b> promissory <b>notes, and we</b> also <b>write a receipt</b> in cases where the creditor loses his promissory note, <b>why do we do this?</b> The combination of allowing postdated promissory notes and allowing the writing of a receipt instead of producing the promissory note would enable double collection of the loan to take place. Rav Kahana <b>said to him:</b> The problem was rectified <b>after Rabbi Abba told his</b> court <b>scribe: When you write postdated</b> promissory <b>notes, write as follows: We did not write this document on its date,</b> i.e., on the date written within the document; <b>rather, we postdated it and wrote it.</b> Since it is clear from the text of the document that it was postdated, double collection of the loan is avoided.
<b>Rav Ashi said to Rav Kahana: But</b> what about <b>today, when we do not do this,</b> i.e., we do not follow Rabbi Abba’s instructions? How do we avoid double collection of the loan? Rav Kahana replied: The problem was rectified <b>after Rav Safra said to his</b> court <b>scribe: When you write these receipts</b> for debtors who pay debts without the original promissory note being torn, <b>if you know the date</b> written <b>in the</b> missing promissory <b>note, write</b> it into the receipt. But <b>if</b> you do <b>not</b> know the date written in the promissory note, <b>write</b> the receipt <b>without specification,</b> i.e., do not write any date at all in the receipt, so <b>that whenever</b> the creditor <b>produces</b> the promissory note, the undated receipt <b>can weaken it,</b> i.e., exempt the debtor from payment.
<b>Ravina said to Rav Ashi, and some say</b> it was <b>Rav Ashi</b> who said <b>to Rav Kahana:</b>

Daf 172a

<b>But today, when we do not do this</b> either when writing receipts, how can we avoid double collection of a loan? Rav Kahana <b>said to him: The Sages instituted</b> taking this precaution. <b>One who does</b> what the Sages instituted <b>does</b> it and protects himself from loss; and as for <b>one who does not do</b> so, <b>he has brought the loss upon himself,</b> and will suffer the consequences if the promissory note is found and presented in the future.
<b>Rava bar Rav Sheila said to those who wrote deeds of acquisition,</b> i.e., deeds of sale or deeds of gifts for property they acquired: <b>When you write deeds of acquisition</b> after the acquisition was performed, <b>if you know the day on which you effected the acquisition, write</b> that date on the document. <b>But if</b> you do <b>not</b> know the day on which you effected the acquisition, <b>write the date on which you are currently</b> writing the document. You should follow this procedure, and not write an approximate or estimated date, <b>so that</b> the document shall <b>not appear as a falsehood.</b>
<b>Rav said to his scribe, and Rav Huna said similarly to his scribe: When you</b> are writing a document and you <b>are situated in Shili, write</b> that the document was written <b>in Shili, and</b> you should do so <b>even if the matters were given over to you,</b> i.e., the transaction attested to in the document took place, <b>in Hini. When you are situated in Hini, write</b> that the document was written <b>in Hini, even if the matters were given over to you in Shili.</b>
§ <b>Rava said:</b> With regard to <b>this one who is holding</b> a promissory <b>note of one hundred dinars, and he says</b> to the court: <b>Prepare</b> this note <b>for me,</b> i.e., exchange it, for <b>two</b> notes <b>of fifty</b> dinars <b>each,</b> so that if the debtor pays half the debt I will be able to give him one document and keep the other, <b>we do not prepare</b> the new notes for him.
<b>What is the reason? The Sages have performed a matter</b> here <b>that</b> is <b>beneficial to the creditor and</b> is <b>beneficial to the debtor</b> as well. It is <b>beneficial to the creditor</b> to keep the promissory note with the larger sum <b>so that</b> he can <b>coerce</b> the debtor <b>to repay him,</b> as there is a greater incentive to pay off a larger promissory note than a smaller one. <b>And</b> it is <b>beneficial to the debtor, so that</b> when he pays half the debt <b>his</b> promissory <b>note becomes vitiated,</b> and the remainder of the sum written in the vitiated promissory note can be collected only if the creditor takes an oath that he has not received the entire sum.
<b>And Rava said</b> further: With regard to <b>this one who is holding two</b> promissory <b>notes, each of fifty dinars,</b> owed by the same person, <b>and he says</b> to the court: <b>Prepare</b> this note <b>for me</b> into <b>a single</b> note <b>of one hundred</b> dinars, <b>we do not prepare</b> the new note for him.
What is the reason? <b>The Sages have performed a matter</b> here <b>that</b> is <b>beneficial to the creditor and</b> is <b>beneficial to the debtor</b> as well. It is <b>beneficial to the creditor</b> to keep the smaller notes, <b>so that</b> if the debtor pays fifty dinars, <b>his</b> promissory <b>note will not become vitiated,</b> which would require the creditor to take an oath before collecting the remainder. <b>And</b> it is <b>beneficial to the debtor, so that</b> the creditor <b>will not</b> be able to <b>coerce him to repay</b> the debt quickly, as there is a greater incentive to repay a larger sum than a smaller one.
<b>Rav Ashi says:</b> With regard to <b>this one who is holding</b> a promissory <b>note of one hundred dinars, and he said</b> to the court: <b>Prepare</b> this note <b>for me</b> into <b>one</b> note <b>of fifty</b> dinars, as the debtor has paid me half, <b>we do not prepare</b> the new note for him.
<b>What is the reason? We say,</b> i.e., we are concerned, that the following may have happened: <b>This</b> debtor actually <b>repaid</b> all one hundred dinars, <b>and</b> when he did so he <b>said to</b> the creditor: <b>Give me</b> back <b>my</b> promissory <b>note. And</b> the creditor <b>said to him: I lost it. And</b> the creditor <b>wrote a receipt for him</b> in lieu of handing over the promissory note. <b>And</b> now, if we write a new promissory note of fifty dinars for the creditor, <b>he will present this</b> note <b>and say to</b> the debtor, who presents his receipt for a hundred dinars: <b>That</b> receipt <b>is</b> for <b>a different</b> loan that you repaid.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In a case where there are <b>two brothers, one poor and one rich, and their father left them a bathhouse or an olive press</b> as an inheritance, if the father had <b>built</b> these facilities <b>for profit,</b> i.e., to charge others for using them, <b>the profit</b> that accrues after the father’s death is <b>shared equally</b> by the two brothers. If the father had <b>built them for himself</b> and for the members of his household to use, the poor brother, who has little use for these amenities, cannot force the rich brother to convert the facilities to commercial use; rather, <b>the rich</b> brother can <b>say to the poor</b> brother: Go <b>take servants for yourself, and they will bathe in the bathhouse.</b> Or he can say: Go <b>take olives for yourself, and come and make</b> them into oil <b>in the olive press.</b>
If there are <b>two</b> people <b>who were</b> living <b>in one city, one named Yosef ben Shimon and the other</b> also <b>named Yosef ben Shimon, one cannot present a promissory note against the other,</b> as the purported debtor can claim: On the contrary, it is you who owed me money; you repaid me and I returned this note to you upon payment. <b>Nor can another,</b> third person, <b>present a promissory note against</b> either of <b>them,</b> as each one can claim: It is not I but the other Yosef ben Shimon who owes you money.
If a document <b>is found among one’s documents</b> stating: <b>The promissory note against Yosef ben Shimon is repaid,</b> and both men named Yosef ben Shimon owed this man money, <b>the promissory notes of both of them</b> are considered <b>repaid,</b> as it cannot be determined which debt was repaid and which is outstanding.
<b>What should</b> two people with the same name in a single city <b>do</b> in order to conduct their business? <b>They should triple</b> their names by writing three generations: Yosef ben Shimon ben so-and-so. <b>And if they have</b> identical <b>triple</b> names, i.e., not only their fathers but their grandfathers had identical names, <b>they should write an indication</b> as to which one is referred to, such as: The short Yosef ben Shimon or the dark Yosef ben Shimon. <b>And if they have</b> identical <b>indications, they should write:</b> Yosef ben Shimon <b>the priest,</b> if one of them is a priest.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> There was <b>a certain</b> promissory <b>note that was presented at the court of Rav Huna, in which it was written: I, so-and-so son of so-and-so, borrowed one hundred dinars from you.</b> No name was given as the creditor, but the one presenting the document claimed that the money was owed to him.

Daf 172b

<b>Rav Huna said:</b> The term: <b>From you,</b> in the document do not identify anyone in particular, and can mean <b>even: From the Exilarch, or even: From King Shapur.</b>
<b>Rav Ḥisda said to Rabba: Go out</b> and <b>investigate</b> this matter, <b>as tonight Rav Huna will ask this</b> question <b>of you.</b>
Rabba <b>went out, examined</b> the matter, <b>and discovered</b> a relevant source. <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: Concerning <b>a bill of divorce in which there are</b> the signatures of <b>witnesses on</b> the document <b>but there is no date</b> written <b>on it, Abba Shaul says</b> that <b>if</b> it <b>is written in it: I divorced her today,</b> it is <b>valid.</b>
Rabba concludes: <b>Apparently,</b> the term: <b>Today, indicates that day on which</b> the bill of divorce <b>emerges</b> in the presence of the court. <b>Here too,</b> the term: <b>From you,</b> in a promissory note <b>indicates that man from whose possession it emerges.</b>
<b>Abaye said to him: But</b> this is not a valid proof, as <b>perhaps Abba Shaul holds in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rabbi Eliezer, who says</b> that <b>witnesses of the transmission</b> of the bill of divorce <b>effect</b> the divorce. <b>But here, let</b> there be <b>a concern for</b> the possibility of the promissory note <b>falling</b> from its rightful owner and being found by the present holder of the document.
Rabba <b>said to</b> Abaye: <b>We are not concerned for</b> the possibility of a promissory note <b>falling</b> from its rightful owner and being found by another. <b>And from where do you say,</b> i.e., from where can it be proven, <b>that we are not concerned for</b> the possibility of a promissory note <b>falling</b> and being found by another?
<b>As we learned</b> in the mishna: If there are <b>two</b> people <b>who were</b> living <b>in one city, one named Yosef ben Shimon and the other</b> also <b>named Yosef ben Shimon, one cannot present a promissory note against the other,</b> as the purported debtor can claim: On the contrary, it is you who owed me money; you repaid me and I returned this note to you upon payment. <b>Nor can another,</b> third person, <b>present a promissory note against</b> either of <b>them. This</b> indicates that one of <b>them can</b> present a promissory note <b>against others. But why</b> can they do so? <b>Let</b> there be <b>a concern for</b> the possibility of the promissory note <b>falling</b> from one Yosef ben Shimon and being found by the other. <b>Rather,</b> must one <b>not conclude from this</b> mishna that <b>we are not concerned for</b> the possibility of the promissory note <b>falling</b> from one Yosef ben Shimon and being found by the other?
The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> why did <b>Abaye,</b> who is concerned for this possibility, not see a proof to the contrary from the mishna? He would counter: <b>We are not concerned for</b> the possibility of a promissory note <b>falling from one</b> particular person and being found by the other person with the same name, which is the case in the mishna, as that is extremely unlikely. <b>We are concerned for</b> the possibility of a promissory note <b>falling from</b> one of the general <b>public</b> and being found by someone else.

Daf 173a

The Gemara asks: <b>And</b> what of <b>that which is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as</b> the two men named Yosef ben Shimon <b>cannot produce a promissory note, this</b> one <b>against that</b> one, <b>so they cannot produce</b> promissory notes <b>against others,</b> as those others can claim: I did not borrow from you but from the other Yosef ben Shimon, and somehow the note he was holding is in your possession? This <i>baraita</i> contradicts the mishna, from which it was inferred that one of the two men named Yosef ben Shimon can produce promissory notes to collect the debt from others. <b>With regard to what</b> principle <b>do</b> the mishna and <i>baraita</i> <b>disagree?</b>
<b>They disagree with regard to</b> whether <b>letters,</b> i.e., the content of a promissory note, <b>are acquired by</b> merely <b>transferring</b> the document to a new owner. In other words, they disagree about whether or not a creditor can transfer his right to collect a debt to another by merely transferring the document to him.
<b>The <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>maintains</b> that <b>letters are acquired by transferring</b> the document. There is no concern that the promissory note was inadvertently transferred from one Yosef ben Shimon to the other by being lost and then found, as explained earlier. Nevertheless, there is still the possibility that one Yosef ben Shimon deliberately transferred the promissory note to the other, transferring the right of collection to him. According to this <i>tanna</i>, the second Yosef ben Shimon is fully entitled to collect the debt by producing the promissory note. <b>And the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> holds</b> that <b>letters are not acquired by transferring</b> the document, so that even if one Yosef ben Shimon transferred his promissory note to the other, the new holder of the document is not entitled to collect the debt.
<b>And if you wish, say that everyone,</b> i.e., both the <i>tanna</i> of the mishna and the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, holds that <b>letters are acquired by transferring</b> the document, <b>and here they disagree with regard to</b> whether or not the new holder of the promissory note is <b>required to bring proof</b> that the original creditor transferred it to him for collection, as opposed to his having received it for safekeeping or having found it by chance. <b>The <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>holds</b> that the present holder of the document is <b>not required to bring proof</b> that the debt was transferred to him and therefore he can collect the debt through the promissory note in his possession. <b>And the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> holds</b> that he is <b>required to bring</b> such <b>proof,</b> and in its absence he cannot collect the debt with the document he holds.
This is <b>as it was stated: Letters are acquired by transferring</b> the document. <b>Abaye says:</b> The new holder of the document is <b>required to bring proof</b> that he has in fact acquired the right to collect the debt. <b>And Rava says: He is not required to bring</b> such <b>proof;</b> it is assumed that if he is holding the document it was transferred to him knowingly by the original creditor.
<b>Abaye said: From where do I say</b> that he is required to bring proof? This is <b>as it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one of</b> several <b>brothers,</b> heirs of an estate, <b>who has a promissory note in his possession</b> listing a debt owed to the deceased father, and he seeks to collect the debt for himself, it is <b>upon him to bring proof</b> that the document was transferred to him legally by his father in his lifetime, or that it was bequeathed to him specifically and he did not appropriate it from the other brothers. Abaye concludes from this: <b>What, is the same not true for</b> all <b>others</b> in a similar situation? In other words, whenever someone holds a promissory note that did not initially belong to him he is required to prove that he acquired it legally.
<b>And Rava said</b> in response: Proof is not generally required in such a case. But the case of <b>brothers</b> who are heirs <b>is different, as</b> it is common for brothers who are co-heirs to <b>seize</b> property belonging to the estate <b>from one another.</b>
<b>There are</b> those <b>who say</b> there is a different version of this exchange between Abaye and Rava. According to this version, <b>Rava said: From where do I say</b> that no proof is required? <b>As it is taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: In the case of <b>one of</b> several <b>brothers,</b> heirs of an estate, <b>who has a promissory note in his possession</b> listing a debt owed to the deceased father, and he seeks to collect the debt for himself, it is <b>upon him to bring proof</b> that the document was transferred to him legally by his father in his lifetime, or that it was bequeathed to him specifically and that he did not appropriate it from the other brothers. The implication is that <b>it is</b> only <b>brothers</b> who must bring such proof, as it is common for brothers who are co-heirs to <b>seize</b> property belonging to the estate <b>from one another. But others</b> in a similar situation do <b>not</b> have to bring proof that they acquired the promissory note legally.
<b>And</b> how would <b>Abaye</b> counter this proof? He would say: There is no difference between <b>brothers</b> and anyone else; they all have to bring proof. The <i>baraita</i> specifies brothers because it <b>was necessary for it</b> to mention that case, as it might <b>enter your mind to say</b> that <b>since</b> it is common for brothers who are co-heirs to <b>seize</b> property belonging to the estate <b>from one another,</b> one might <b>say</b> that <b>they are careful</b> to prevent such attempts. <b>And</b> therefore, when brothers produce a promissory note, <b>they are not required to bring proof</b> that they obtained it legally, as it is assumed that the other brothers would not have allowed the note to escape their possession otherwise. To counter this, the <i>baraita</i> <b>teaches us</b> that brothers, too, must bring proof when they produce promissory notes.
§ The Gemara returns to discuss the case of two men with the same name. <b>But</b> what about <b>that which is taught</b> in another <i>baraita</i>: <b>Just as</b> the two men named Yosef ben Shimon <b>can produce a promissory note against others, so can they produce</b> promissory notes <b>against one another.</b> This represents a third opinion, standing in opposition to both the mishna and the previous <i>baraita</i>. The Gemara asks: <b>With regard to what do</b> the mishna and first <i>baraita</i> on the one hand, and this <i>baraita</i> on the other, <b>disagree?</b>
The Gemara answers: <b>They disagree about</b> whether or not a scribe <b>may write</b> a promissory <b>note for a debtor even if</b> the <b>creditor is not with him.</b>
<b>The <i>tanna</i> of our</b> mishna <b>holds</b> that a scribe <b>may write</b> a promissory <b>note for a debtor even if the creditor is not with him.</b> The Gemara explains: At <b>times,</b> it could happen <b>that</b> one of the men named Yosef ben Shimon <b>goes to a scribe and</b> to <b>witnesses and says to them: Write</b> a promissory <b>note for me, as I wish to borrow</b> money <b>from another Yosef ben Shimon. And</b> then, <b>after they write</b> the document <b>and sign</b> it <b>for him,</b> he will <b>take it and say to</b> the other Yosef ben Shimon: <b>Give me the hundred</b> dinars <b>that you borrowed from me,</b> as attested to in this document. That is the reason why the mishna rules that two people of the same name cannot collect a debt through a promissory note from one another, thereby preventing this occurrence.
By contrast, <b>the <i>tanna</i> of the</b> other <b><i>baraita</i> holds</b> that a scribe <b>may not write</b> a promissory <b>note for a debtor unless</b> the <b>creditor is with him</b> and consents to the writing of the document. If one Yosef ben Shimon consents to the writing of the document before the other, they apparently trust one another, and there is no concern that the one holding the promissory note will defraud the other.
§ The mishna teaches: If a document is <b>found among one’s documents</b> stating: The promissory <b>note against Yosef ben Shimon is repaid,</b> and both men named Yosef ben Shimon owed this man money, <b>the</b> promissory <b>notes of both of them are</b> considered <b>repaid,</b> as it cannot be determined which debt was repaid and which is outstanding. The Gemara comments: The implication of the mishna is that <b>the reason</b> this man cannot collect his debt is <b>that</b> this note <b>was found</b> among his papers; <b>but</b> if it was <b>not</b> suddenly found, rather he was always aware of its existence, <b>he could present</b> a promissory note against one of the men named Yosef ben Shimon and collect the debt from him. The Gemara asks: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> earlier in the mishna: <b>Nor can another present a promissory note against</b> either of <b>them?</b>
<b>Rabbi Yirmeya said:</b> This later line in the mishna is stated <b>with regard to</b> a promissory note in which the debtors Yosef ben Shimon are identified by having their names <b>tripled,</b> i.e., through mentioning the name of their respective grandfathers, as is explained at the end of the mishna.
The Gemara questions this explanation: <b>But let us see in whose name</b> the <b>receipt,</b> i.e., the note stating that Yosef ben Shimon’s debt has been repaid, <b>is written.</b> Why is there uncertainty as to which Yosef ben Shimon is referred to in the document? <b>Rav Hoshaya said:</b> The case is <b>where</b> the debtors are identified by having their names <b>tripled in the</b> promissory <b>note, but</b> the names are <b>not tripled in the receipt.</b>
<b>Abaye stated</b> a different answer to this question, that the mishna is speaking about the debtor, not the creditor, and <b>this</b> is what <b>it is saying:</b> If a receipt is <b>found among the debtor’s documents</b> stating: <b>The</b> promissory <b>note of Yosef ben Shimon</b> against me has been <b>repaid,</b> and this debtor had borrowed money from both men named Yosef ben Shimon, <b>the</b> promissory <b>notes of both of them are</b> considered <b>repaid,</b> i.e., they are not valid for collection, as it cannot be determined which debt was paid and which one is outstanding.
The mishna teaches: <b>What should</b> two people with the same name in a single city <b>do</b> in order to conduct their business? <b>They should triple</b> their names by writing three generations: Yosef ben Shimon ben so-and-so. If their grandfather’s names are identical and they have no prominent physical difference to indicate who is the one listed in the document, they write that the one referred to in the document is a priest, if that is the case. The Sages <b>taught</b> the following continuation of the mishna in a <i>baraita</i>: And <b>if both of them were priests, they should write</b> several <b>generations</b> of ancestors, until a divergence in names is found that can serve as a means of identification.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> In the case of <b>one who says to his son</b> before dying: One promissory <b>note among</b> the promissory <b>notes</b> in <b>my</b> possession <b>is repaid, but I do not know which one, the</b> promissory <b>notes of all of</b> those who owe him money <b>are</b> considered <b>repaid,</b> i.e., they are not valid for collection, as it cannot be determined which debt was repaid and which are outstanding. If there were <b>found</b> among his papers <b>two</b> promissory notes owed <b>by one</b> person, the one for <b>the greater</b> amount <b>is</b> considered <b>repaid, and</b> the one for <b>the smaller</b> amount <b>is not</b> considered <b>repaid</b> and can be collected; the debtor is favored in the case of an uncertainty.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Rava says</b> that if a creditor says to a debtor who borrowed money twice from him: One promissory <b>note</b> of the two that I have <b>of yours in my possession is repaid,</b> without specifying which one, the one for <b>the greater</b> amount <b>is</b> considered <b>repaid, and</b> the one for <b>the smaller</b> amount <b>is not</b> considered <b>repaid,</b> and can be collected. If the creditor said instead: <b>The debt of yours</b> that I have <b>in my possession is repaid, all</b> the promissory <b>notes</b> this creditor has from this debtor <b>are</b> considered <b>repaid,</b> as the term debt covers all the loans at once.
<b>Ravina said to Rava: If that is so</b> that when one makes an ambiguous statement it is interpreted to his detriment, does the same <i>halakha</i> apply to sales? If a seller of land writes a document for a purchaser stating: <b>My field is</b> hereby <b>sold to you,</b> without specifying which of his two fields he is referring to, is it the <b>larger field</b> that is <b>sold to him?</b> And if he writes a document for the purchaser stating: The <b>field that I have is sold to you,</b> is it so that <b>all of his fields are sold to him,</b> as the Hebrew word for field can refer to several fields as well as a single field?
Rava explains: <b>There, the holder of the document</b> of sale <b>is at a disadvantage,</b> as it is he who seeks to take more property from the seller, and must accept the minimal meaning. Here too, in the case of the promissory notes, it is the holder of the document, the creditor, who seeks to collect more money from the debtor. Therefore, the creditor is at a disadvantage.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who lends</b> money <b>to another with</b> the assurance of <b>a guarantor cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor.</b>

Daf 173b

<b>But if</b> the creditor <b>said to</b> the debtor: I am lending the money <b>on the condition that I will collect</b> the debt <b>from whomever I wish,</b> i.e., either the debtor or the guarantor, he <b>can collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If the debtor has property</b> of his own, then <b>whether</b> in <b>this</b> case, where the creditor stipulated this condition, <b>or that</b> case, where he did not, he <b>cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor.</b>
<b>And so Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel would say:</b> If there is <b>a guarantor for a woman for her marriage contract,</b> from whom the woman can collect payment of her marriage contract instead of collecting it from the husband, <b>and her husband was divorcing her,</b> the husband <b>must take a vow</b> prohibiting himself from deriving any <b>benefit from her,</b> so that he can never remarry her. This precaution is taken <b>lest</b> the couple <b>collude [<i>kenunya</i>]</b> to divorce in order to collect payment of the marriage contract <b>from this</b> guarantor’s <b>property, and</b> then the husband <b>will remarry</b> his wife.
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> The mishna teaches: One who lends money to another with a guarantor cannot collect the debt from the guarantor. The Gemara at first understands that the mishna is ruling that a guarantor’s commitment is limited to when the debtor dies or flees. <b>What is the reason</b> the guarantor’s commitment is limited? <b>Rabba and Rav Yosef both say</b> that the guarantor can tell the creditor: <b>You gave a man over to me,</b> to take responsibility for him if he dies or flees; <b>I have given a man</b> back <b>to you.</b> The debtor is here before you; take your money from him, and if he has nothing, suffer the loss yourself.
<b>Rav Naḥman objects to this: This is Persian law.</b>
The Gemara interjects: <b>On the contrary,</b> the Persian courts <b>go after the guarantor</b> directly, without even attempting to collect the debt from the debtor himself. Why, then, did Rav Naḥman say that excusing the guarantor from payment is Persian law?
The Gemara clarifies Rav Naḥman’s intent: <b>Rather,</b> Rav Naḥman meant to say that this kind of ruling would be appropriate for the members of <b>a Persian court, who do not give a reason for their statements,</b> but issue rulings by whim. Rav Naḥman was saying that it is not fair or logical to excuse the guarantor and cause a loss to the creditor who was depending on him.
<b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said: What</b> does the mishna mean when it says that the creditor <b>cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor?</b> It means that he <b>cannot claim</b> payment from the <b>guarantor at the outset,</b> until after it is established that the debtor has no means to repay the debt. After the borrower defaults, the creditor can collect the debt from the guarantor.
<b>This</b> <i>halakha</i> <b>is also taught</b> in a <i>baraita</i>: One <b>who lends</b> money <b>to another with</b> the assurance of <b>a guarantor cannot claim</b> payment of the debt <b>from the guarantor at the outset,</b> rather, he must first attempt to collect the debt from the debtor. <b>But if</b> the creditor <b>said to</b> the debtor: I am lending the money <b>on the condition that I will collect</b> the debt <b>from whomever I wish,</b> he can <b>claim payment</b> of the debt <b>from the guarantor at the outset,</b> bypassing the debtor.
§ <b>Rav Huna said: From where</b> is it derived <b>that a guarantor becomes obligated</b> to repay a loan he has guaranteed? <b>As it is written</b> that Judah reassured his father concerning the young Benjamin: <b>“I will be his guarantor; of my hand shall you request him”</b> (Genesis 43:9). This teaches that it is possible for one to act as a guarantor that an item will be returned to the giver.
<b>Rav Ḥisda objects to this: This</b> incident involving Benjamin is not a case of a standard guarantor, but a case of <b>an unconditional guarantee, as it is written,</b> also in the context of Benjamin, that Reuben said: <b>“Deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him back to you”</b> (Genesis 42:37). One who undertakes unconditional responsibility for a loan has a different status than a standard guarantor, as will soon be elaborated. Therefore, a biblical source has yet to be adduced to teach that one can become a standard guarantor.
<b>Rather, Rabbi Yitzḥak said</b> that the source is <b>from here: “Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; and hold him in pledge that is surety for an alien woman”</b> (Proverbs 20:16). The verse advises a creditor to take the garment of the debtor’s guarantor as payment for the loan.
<b>And it is stated: “My son, if you have become surety for your neighbor, if you have shaken your hands for a stranger, you have become ensnared by the words of your mouth, you have been caught by the words of your mouth. Do this now, my son, and save yourself, seeing that you have come into the hand of your neighbor: Go, humble yourself [<i>hitrappes</i>], and assemble your neighbors”</b> (Proverbs 6:1–3). This last part of the passage means: <b>If</b> your neighbor’s <b>money is in your possession,</b> as you owe it as a guarantor, <b>open up [<i>hatter</i>] the palm [<i>pissat</i>] of your hand</b> and repay him. <b>And if</b> it is <b>not</b> money that you owe him, but rather “you have become ensnared by the words of your mouth” and owe him an apology for a personal slight, <b>gather together many neighbors</b> through which to seek his forgiveness.
§ <b>Ameimar said:</b> The issue of <b>whether</b> or not <b>a guarantor</b> in fact <b>becomes obligated</b> to repay the loan he has guaranteed is <b>a dispute</b> between <b>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Yosei. According to Rabbi Yosei, who says</b> that <b>a transaction with inconclusive consent [<i>asmakhta</i>] effects acquisition, a guarantor becomes obligated</b> to repay the loan, whereas <b>according to Rabbi Yehuda, who says</b> that <b>an <i>asmakhta</i> does not effect acquisition, a guarantor</b> does <b>not become obligated</b> to repay the loan. Any obligation one undertakes that is dependent on the fulfillment of certain conditions that he does not expect will be fulfilled, in this case the debtor’s default on the loan, is considered an <i>asmakhta</i>.
<b>Rav Ashi said to Ameimar</b> that he was conflating these two issues: <b>But</b> it is <b>a daily occurrence,</b> i.e., it is taken for granted, <b>that an <i>asmakhta</i> does not effect acquisition, and</b> it is also taken for granted that <b>a guarantor becomes obligated</b> to repay the loan he has guaranteed.
<b>Rather, Rav Ashi said: Through that satisfaction that</b> the guarantor feels when the creditor <b>trusts him</b> and loans the money based on his guarantee, the guarantor <b>resolves</b> to <b>obligate himself</b> to repay the loan. Guaranteeing a loan is unlike a usual case of an obligation undertaken that is dependent on the fulfillment of certain conditions that he does not expect will be fulfilled, in which the commitment is not considered a real one. Here, the one obligating himself experiences a sense of satisfaction when the money is loaned to the debtor, and due to that, fully commits to fulfill his obligation.
§ The mishna teaches: <b>But if</b> the creditor <b>said</b> to the debtor: I am lending the money <b>on the condition that I will collect</b> the debt <b>from whomever I wish,</b> he can collect the debt from the guarantor. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: They taught</b> this <b>only when the debtor has no property</b> of his own from which to repay the loan, <b>but</b> if <b>the debtor has property</b> the creditor <b>cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor.</b>
The Gemara questions this assertion: <b>But from</b> the fact <b>that the latter clause</b> of the mishna <b>teaches</b> that <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If the debtor has property</b> of his own, then whether in this case, where the creditor stipulated this condition, or that case, where he did not, he <b>cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor, by inference</b> one can understand <b>that the first <i>tanna</i> maintains</b> that there <b>is no difference</b> if it is <b>like this and</b> there <b>is no difference</b> if it is <b>like that.</b> Whether or not the debtor has property from which to repay the loan, the creditor can collect the debt from the guarantor.
The Gemara clarifies: The mishna <b>is incomplete and this</b> is what <b>it is teaching: One who lends</b> money <b>to another with</b> the assurance of <b>a guarantor cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor</b> before first claiming the debt from the debtor. <b>But if</b> the creditor <b>said</b> to the debtor: I am lending the money <b>on the condition that I will collect</b> the debt <b>from whomever I wish,</b> he <b>can collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor. In what</b> case <b>is this statement said? When the debtor has no property</b> of his own from which to repay the debt; <b>but</b> if <b>the debtor has property,</b> the creditor <b>cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor.</b> This is the <i>halakha</i> with regard to a standard guarantor, <b>but</b> in the case of <b>an unconditional guarantor, even if the debtor has property</b> of his own, the creditor <b>can collect</b> the debt <b>from the unconditional guarantor.</b>

Daf 174a

<b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: If the debtor has property,</b> in <b>both this</b> case <b>and</b> in <b>that</b> case, i.e., whether the guarantor is a standard guarantor or an unconditional guarantor, the creditor <b>cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from</b> either type of guarantor.
<b>Rabba bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Wherever Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel taught</b> a <i>halakha</i> <b>in</b> the corpus of <b>our Mishna,</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with his</b> opinion, <b>except for</b> the following three cases: The responsibility of the <b>guarantor, and</b> the incident that occurred in the city of <b>Tzaidan</b> (see <i>Gittin</i> 74a), <b>and</b> the dispute with regard to <b>evidence</b> in the <b>final</b> disagreement (see <i>Sanhedrin</i> 31a).
§ The Gemara discusses which expressions confer upon a person the status of a standard guarantor, and which confer the status of an unconditional guarantor. <b>Rav Huna says</b> that if one says to a potential creditor: <b>Lend</b> money to <b>him and I</b> am <b>a guarantor,</b> or: <b>Lend</b> money to <b>him and I</b> will <b>repay</b> the debt, or: <b>Lend</b> money to <b>him and I</b> am <b>obligated</b> to repay the debt, or: <b>Lend</b> money to <b>him and I</b> will <b>give</b> the money back to you, <b>all these are expressions</b> that confer the status of a standard <b>guarantee.</b>
If one says: <b>Give</b> money <b>to him and I</b> am <b>an unconditional guarantor,</b> or: <b>Give</b> money <b>to him and I</b> will <b>repay</b> the debt, or: <b>Give</b> money <b>to him and I</b> am <b>obligated</b> to repay the debt, or: <b>Give</b> money <b>to him and I</b> will <b>give</b> the money back to you, <b>all these are expressions</b> that confer the status of <b>an unconditional guarantee.</b> The usage of the word give, as opposed to lend, confers the status of an unconditional guarantor.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What</b> is the <i>halakha</i> if one says: <b>Lend</b> money to <b>him and I</b> am <b>an unconditional guarantor?</b> On the one hand, the word lend is used, as opposed to give, but on the other hand, he explicitly states that he will be an unconditional guarantor. What is the <i>halakha</i> if one says: <b>Give</b> money <b>to him and I</b> am <b>a guarantor?</b> On the one hand, the word give is used, as opposed to lend, but on the other hand, he states that he will be a guarantor.
<b>Rabbi Yitzḥak says</b> in resolving this dilemma: When one employs <b>the language of</b> a standard <b>guarantee,</b> it is a standard <b>guarantee,</b> even if he also used the word give. And when one employs <b>the language of an unconditional guarantee,</b> it is <b>an unconditional guarantee,</b> even if he also used the word lend.
<b>Rav Ḥisda says: All of</b> the expressions mentioned in this discussion <b>are expressions of an unconditional guarantee, except for: Lend</b> money to <b>him and I</b> am <b>a guarantor.</b>
<b>Rava says: All</b> of the expressions mentioned in this discussion <b>are expressions of</b> a standard <b>guarantee, except for: Give</b> money <b>to him and I</b> will <b>give</b> the money back to you.
<b>Mar bar Ameimar said to Rav Ashi: My father said the following:</b> If one says: <b>Give</b> money <b>to him and I</b> will <b>give</b> the money back to you, this expression binds the guarantor to such an extent that <b>the lender has no</b> claim <b>against the debtor at all;</b> his only option is to collect the debt from the guarantor.
The Gemara rejects this last statement: <b>But</b> that <b>is not so.</b> Rather, <b>the debtor is not exempted from</b> dealing with the <b>creditor unless</b> the guarantor <b>takes</b> the money from the creditor <b>and gives</b> it to the debtor <b>with</b> his own <b>hand.</b>
§ The Gemara relates: There was once <b>a certain judge who permitted a creditor to enter the debtor’s property</b> and collect it for his debt <b>before lodging a claim against the debtor</b> himself. <b>Rav Ḥanin, son of Rav Yeiva,</b> overruled that judge and <b>expelled</b> the creditor from the seized property.
When <b>Rava</b> heard about this he <b>said: Who</b> is <b>wise</b> enough <b>to perform such a matter,</b> i.e., to issue this ruling, <b>if not Rav Ḥanin, son of Rav Yeiva? He holds that a person’s property is a guarantee for him,</b> i.e., it acts as a guarantor for the loan if the debtor does not repay it; <b>and we learned</b> in the mishna: <b>One who lends</b> money <b>to another with</b> the assurance of <b>a guarantor cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor. And we established</b> that the mishna means that he <b>cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the guarantor at the outset,</b> before seeking payment from the debtor himself. So too, he cannot collect the debt by taking the debtor’s property without first seeking payment from the debtor himself.
§ The Gemara relates: There was once <b>a certain guarantor for orphans</b> whose father borrowed money and died, and the orphans were minors, and this guarantor <b>repaid</b> the debt <b>to the creditor before informing the orphans</b> that he was repaying the debt for them. The guarantor now sought reimbursement from the orphans.
<b>Rav Pappa said: Repaying a creditor</b> is <b>a mitzva, and orphans</b> who are minors <b>are not obligated in performing a mitzva.</b> They therefore do not have to repay any debts owed by their deceased father until they reach the age of majority.
<b>And Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> also <b>said</b> that the orphans do not have to repay the guarantor until reaching majority, but for a different reason: <b>Say</b> that perhaps the deceased <b>gave bundles</b> of money <b>to</b> his creditor before his death, and therefore some or all of the debt has been paid. As long as they are minors, the heirs would not be aware of this payment, but upon reaching majority there is a chance that they may examine their father’s papers and discover that their father had done this. Therefore, payment is deferred until they reach majority.

Daf 174b

The Gemara asks: <b>What is</b> the difference <b>between</b> the opinion of Rav Pappa and that of Rav Huna, son of Yehoshua, as both agree that the orphans are exempt from repaying the debt until they reach majority?
The Gemara answers: The difference <b>between them</b> is in a case <b>where the one who owed</b> the money, i.e., the deceased, <b>admits</b> explicitly just before his death that he did not yet repay any of his loan. <b>Alternatively,</b> there is a difference between them in a case <b>where</b> the court <b>excommunicated</b> the deceased for not cooperating with the court in repaying his debt, <b>and he died</b> while still <b>in</b> a state of <b>excommunication,</b> which demonstrates that the debt had not been repaid prior to his death. In both of these cases Rav Pappa would exempt the minor orphans from payment, as minors are not obligated to perform mitzvot, while Rav Huna, son of Yehoshua, would require them to repay the debt immediately, as there is no possibility that their father had repaid the debt.
The Sages of Eretz Yisrael <b>sent</b> a ruling <b>from there</b> to Babylonia: In a case where the court had <b>excommunicated</b> a debtor for not cooperating in repaying his debt, <b>and</b> the debtor <b>died</b> while still <b>in</b> a state of <b>excommunication, the <i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua,</b> and the orphans must repay the debt immediately.
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i> 11:15): <b>A guarantor</b> for a debt <b>who has the promissory note</b> for that debt <b>in his possession,</b> indicating that he has repaid the debt, and now seeks reimbursement from the debtor, <b>cannot collect</b> if the debtor has died and the obligation for the debt has fallen to his minor heirs. <b>But if it is written</b> by the creditor <b>in</b> the promissory note: <b>I received</b> repayment <b>from you,</b> the guarantor, then the guarantor <b>can collect</b> the debt from the minor heirs.
The Gemara explains the objection: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Huna, son of Rav Yehoshua, you find</b> a case where the minor heirs would be required to repay the debt, such as <b>when the one who owed</b> the money, i.e., the deceased, <b>admits</b> explicitly just before his death that he did not yet repay the loan. <b>But according to</b> the opinion of <b>Rav Pappa,</b> who maintains that minor heirs never have to repay their father’s debts, it is <b>difficult.</b> What is the case discussed in the <i>baraita</i>?
The Gemara answers: It is <b>different there,</b> as it is <b>for this</b> reason that the creditor <b>troubled himself and wrote for</b> the guarantor: <b>I received</b> repayment from you. Once the creditor writes this in the promissory note, it attains the status of a promissory note of the guarantor held directly against the debtor, and even Rav Pappa agrees that a debt that is recorded in a promissory note can be collected from the deceased’s property immediately, even from the minor heirs.
The Gemara relates: There was <b>a certain guarantor</b> who had guaranteed a loan given <b>by a gentile, who repaid the gentile</b> creditor <b>before</b> the gentile creditor <b>claimed</b> repayment <b>from the orphans</b> who survived the debtor. The guarantor now sought reimbursement from the orphans. <b>Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: This is</b> what <b>Avimi of Hagronya said in the name of Rava: Even according to the one who says</b> that <b>we are concerned for</b> the possibility that the deceased may have given <b>bundles</b> of money to the creditor before his death, <b>this statement</b> applies only in the case of <b>a Jewish</b> creditor. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a gentile</b> creditor, <b>since</b> according to gentile law he is entitled to <b>go</b> directly <b>to a guarantor, we are not concerned for</b> the possibility that the deceased may have given <b>bundles</b> of money. The debtor would not repay the gentile before the loan is due, as the latter has the right to collect directly from the guarantor, and would thereby receive double payment.
Rav Ashi <b>said to</b> Rav Mordekhai: <b>On the contrary, even according to the one who says</b> that <b>we are not concerned for</b> the possibility that the deceased may have given <b>bundles</b> of money, <b>this statement</b> applies only in the case of <b>a Jewish</b> creditor. <b>But</b> in the case of <b>a gentile</b> creditor, <b>since</b> according to gentile <b>law they</b> are entitled to <b>go</b> directly <b>to a guarantor, no</b> guarantor <b>would accept</b> upon himself to guarantee such a loan <b>if the debtor had not given bundles</b> of money as collateral to the gentile creditor <b>from the outset.</b>
§ The mishna teaches: <b>And so Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel would say:</b> If there is <b>a guarantor for a woman for her marriage contract,</b> and her husband is divorcing her, the husband must take a vow prohibiting himself from deriving any benefit from her so that he can never remarry her. The Gemara relates an incident pertaining to this ruling: Someone named <b>Moshe bar Atzari was a guarantor for the marriage contract of his daughter-in-law,</b> guaranteeing the money promised by his son in the event of death or divorce. <b>His son,</b> named <b>Rav Huna, was a young Torah scholar, and was in financial straits. Abaye said: Is there no one who will go advise Rav Huna that he should divorce his wife, and she will go and collect her marriage contract from</b> Rav Huna’s <b>father, and then</b> Rav Huna should <b>remarry her?</b>
<b>Rava said to</b> Abaye: <b>But didn’t we learn</b> in the mishna that when a husband divorces his wife in such circumstances he <b>must take a vow</b> prohibiting himself from deriving any <b>benefit</b> from <b>her,</b> thereby precluding the possibility of remarriage? <b>Abaye said to him: Is that to say</b> that <b>everyone who divorces</b> his wife <b>divorces</b> her <b>in a court?</b> Rav Huna could be advised to divorce his wife outside the court, in which case he could do so without being forced to take the prescribed vow.
<b>Ultimately, it was revealed that</b> this Rav Huna <b>was a priest,</b> who may not marry a divorcée, even his own ex-wife. Abaye’s suggestion was therefore not an option for him. Upon hearing this, <b>Abaye said: This</b> is in accordance with the adage <b>that people say: Poverty follows the poor.</b>
The Gemara asks: <b>But did Abaye</b> really <b>say this?</b> Would he really encourage giving such advice? <b>But doesn’t Abaye</b> himself <b>say: Who is a cunning, wicked person? This</b> is <b>one who provides advice to sell property in accordance with</b> the ruling of <b>Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel.</b> As taught elsewhere (<i>Ketubot</i> 95b), if one says: My property is hereby bequeathed to you, and after you die it will pass to so-and-so, Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel rules that the first recipient can sell the property, which would thereby deprive the second recipient from receiving it. Abaye said that giving advice to someone to pursue such action, though it is legally sound, is considered wicked. Here as well, why would he give advice to Rav Huna to divorce his wife only in order to force his father to pay the marriage contract?
The Gemara answers: When dealing with one’s <b>son</b> it <b>is different.</b> It is not considered wickedness to force a father to give money to his own son. Moreover, when dealing with <b>a Torah scholar</b> it <b>is different.</b> It is not considered wickedness to procure money for a Torah scholar, because the money enables him to pursue his studies.
The Gemara asks another question with regard to this incident: <b>But wasn’t</b> Moshe bar Atzari <b>a guarantor? And we maintain,</b> as the Gemara will soon note, that <b>a guarantor for a marriage contract does not become obligated</b> to pay. The Gemara answers: <b>He was an unconditional guarantor.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>This works out well according to the one who says</b> that <b>an unconditional guarantor for a marriage contract becomes obligated</b> to pay it <b>even if the husband has no property</b> of his own at the time of the marriage. According to this opinion all is <b>well. But according to the one who says: If</b> the husband <b>has</b> his own property the unconditional guarantor <b>becomes obligated</b> to pay, but <b>if</b> the husband <b>does not have</b> his own property <b>he does not become obligated, what is there to say?</b> Rav Huna obviously did not have any property of his own. Why, then, was his father held responsible for paying his marriage contract according to this latter opinion?
The Gemara answers: <b>If you wish, say</b> that Rav Huna <b>had</b> property when he got married, so that his father’s guarantee took effect, <b>but it became blighted,</b> i.e., it was ruined or lost in the interim. <b>And if you wish, say</b> instead: <b>A father, vis-à-vis his son,</b> sincerely <b>obligates himself</b> to guarantee his marriage contract, even when the son has no property of his own.
The Gemara elaborates on the issue under discussion. This is <b>as it was stated: Everyone agrees</b> that a standard <b>guarantor for a marriage contract does not become obligated</b> to pay the marriage contract, and <b>everyone agrees</b> that <b>an unconditional guarantor for a creditor,</b> i.e., for a loan, <b>becomes obligated</b> to repay the loan. With regard to <b>an unconditional guarantor for a marriage contract and</b> a standard <b>guarantor for a creditor,</b> the Sages <b>disagree.</b> One <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>if the debtor</b> or husband <b>has</b> his own <b>property,</b> these guarantors <b>become obligated</b> for the guarantees they have undertaken, but <b>if he does not have</b> his own property the guarantor <b>does not become obligated. And</b> one <b>Sage holds</b> that <b>whether</b> the debtor or husband <b>has</b> property <b>or does not have</b> property, the guarantor <b>becomes obligated</b> to pay it.
<b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a guarantor becomes obligated</b> to pay, <b>whether</b> the debtor <b>has</b> his own property <b>or does not have</b> property. This is <b>to the exclusion of a guarantor for a marriage contract,</b> in <b>which</b> case <b>even if the husband has</b> his own property <b>he does not become obligated</b> to pay. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The intention of the guarantor <b>is to perform</b> the <b>mitzva</b> of facilitating a marriage by encouraging the woman to consent to the marriage as a result of his involvement, but he does not truly intend to obligate himself. <b>And</b> furthermore, in contrast to a guarantor for a loan, where the creditor stands to suffer a loss if he is not repaid, the woman <b>does not</b> suffer any concrete <b>loss,</b> as the husband does not borrow money from the woman. Therefore, the level of commitment of the guarantor in this case is lower. Accordingly, the Sages instituted that the guarantor does not become responsible for payment of the marriage contract from his own property.
§ <b>Rav Huna says</b> that <b>a person on his deathbed who consecrated all his property</b> to the Temple treasury, <b>and</b> then <b>says: So-and-so has one hundred dinars in my possession,</b> i.e., I owe one hundred dinars to so-and-so, is <b>deemed credible,</b> and the money is to be repaid to that person. The reason for this is that there is <b>a presumption</b> that <b>a person does not collude against</b> the <b>Temple</b> treasury. He would not lie about owing money to someone, thereby causing a loss to the Temple treasury.
<b>Rav Naḥman objects to this</b> ruling: <b>And does a person collude against his children?</b> Of course not. Yet, <b>as Rav and Shmuel both say</b> that in the case of <b>a person on his deathbed who says: So-and-so has one hundred dinars in my possession,</b> only if <b>he says</b> explicitly: <b>Give</b> him the money, the children <b>give</b> it, but if <b>he did not say</b> explicitly: <b>Give</b> him the money, the children do <b>not give</b> it. The person on his deathbed is not assumed to be telling the truth about owing the money unless he explicitly instructs that the money be given. <b>Apparently,</b> then, it is assumed that <b>a person is prone</b> to make false statements so as <b>not to make his sons</b> appear <b>sated,</b> i.e., wealthy. A person on his deathbed may falsely claim that he is in debt in order to dispel the notion that his children are wealthy heirs.

Daf 175a

<b>Here, too,</b> with regard to the Temple treasury, apply the same principle and say: <b>A person is prone</b> to make false statements so as <b>not to make himself</b> appear <b>sated.</b> It is therefore possible that the money was not owed, and payment should not be made from the consecrated property.
The Gemara answers: <b>When</b> does <b>Rav Huna say</b> that payment should be made <b>there,</b> in the case of a person on his deathbed who consecrated all his property? In a case <b>where</b> the creditor, to whom the deceased admitted owing money, <b>holds</b> a promissory <b>note</b> corroborating the deceased’s admission.
The Gemara comments: <b>By inference,</b> the statement <b>of Rav and Shmuel,</b> where the money is not given to the creditor unless the person on his deathbed explicitly requests that it be given, is applicable in a case <b>where</b> the creditor <b>does not hold</b> a promissory <b>note</b> corroborating the admission. The Gemara asks: If so, how can it be that if the deceased <b>says: Give</b> him the money, the children <b>give</b> it to him, i.e., it is collected from the estate left to the heirs, as <b>it is a loan by oral</b> contract, <b>and as Rav and Shmuel both say: One does not collect a loan by oral</b> contract <b>from heirs nor from purchasers</b> who bought land from the debtor after the loan was granted?
The Gemara gives a different answer to this question. <b>Rather, Rav Naḥman said:</b> Both <b>this</b> case <b>and that</b> case are discussing <b>where</b> the creditor <b>holds</b> a promissory <b>note</b> corroborating the deceased’s admission. <b>And</b> yet it is <b>not difficult.</b> In <b>this</b> ruling of Rav Huna, the case is <b>where</b> the creditor’s promissory note has been <b>ratified</b> by the court, and in <b>that</b> ruling of Rav and Shmuel, the case is <b>where</b> the creditor’s promissory note has <b>not</b> been <b>ratified</b> by the court. Therefore, in the latter case, if the person on his deathbed <b>says: Give</b> him the money, he <b>has</b> in effect <b>ratified</b> the creditor’s promissory <b>note,</b> and if he did <b>not say: Give</b> him the money, he has <b>not ratified</b> the creditor’s promissory <b>note.</b>
§ <b>Rabba says</b> that in the case of <b>a person on his deathbed who says: So-and-so has one hundred dinars in my possession, and the orphans</b> who inherited his property subsequently <b>said: We repaid</b> the debt, <b>they are deemed credible.</b> But if the father said: <b>Give one hundred dinars to so-and-so,</b> as I owe it to him, <b>and</b> subsequently <b>the orphans said: We repaid</b> him the money, <b>they are not deemed credible.</b>
The Gemara objects: <b>Isn’t it the opposite [<i>kelappei layya</i>]? The opposite is</b> more <b>reasonable.</b> If the father <b>says: Give one hundred dinars</b> to so-and-so, <b>since their father stated the matter assertively,</b> as he gave an explicit directive, <b>it could be said that</b> the heirs <b>repaid</b> the money. But if he said: <b>So-and-so has one hundred dinars in my possession, since</b> the orphans’ <b>father did not state the matter assertively, it could be said that</b> the heirs <b>did not repay</b> the creditor.
The Gemara reformulates Rabba’s statement: <b>Rather, if</b> Rabba’s statement <b>was stated, it was stated as follows:</b> In a case of <b>a person on his deathbed who says: So-and-so has one hundred dinars in my possession, and the orphans</b> subsequently <b>said:</b> After his admission, <b>Father retracted</b> his words <b>and said to us: I repaid</b> the debt, <b>they are deemed credible. What is the reason</b> for this? At first the father had forgotten, but subsequently <b>he remembered</b> repaying the debt. But if the father says assertively: <b>Give one hundred dinars to so-and-so, and the orphans</b> subsequently <b>said:</b> Afterward <b>Father retracted</b> his words <b>and said: I repaid</b> the debt, <b>they are not deemed credible.</b> The reason is <b>that if it is so that</b> the father <b>repaid</b> the debt or was uncertain about the matter, <b>he would not say</b> with such assertiveness: <b>Give</b> the money to him.
§ <b>Rava raises a dilemma:</b> With regard to <b>a person on his deathbed who,</b> upon hearing someone’s monetary claim against him, <b>admitted</b> owing the money to him, <b>what is</b> the <i>halakha</i>? Is it <b>required</b> for him <b>to say</b> to two people: <b>You are my witnesses,</b> as is usually necessary in order to prove that an admission is stated in earnest and not in jest? <b>Or</b> is it perhaps <b>not required</b> for him <b>to say: You are my witnesses,</b> since he is a person on his deathbed, whose instructions are generally binding? Is it <b>required that he say</b> to two people: <b>Write</b> my admission in a document, as is usually required, <b>or</b> is it <b>not required</b> for him <b>to say: Write</b> my admission in a document? The issue in question here is: Does <b>a person</b> sometimes <b>jest at the time of death,</b> i.e., while on his deathbed, <b>or</b> can it be assumed that <b>a person</b> does <b>not jest at the time of death?</b>
<b>After</b> Rava <b>raised the dilemma, he then resolved it,</b> and ruled: <b>A person</b> does <b>not jest at the time of death, and</b> therefore <b>the statements of a person on his deathbed are considered as</b> if they were <b>written</b> in a document <b>and transmitted</b> to the relevant party.
<strong>MISHNA:</strong> <b>One who lends</b> money <b>to another by means of</b> a promissory <b>note can collect</b> the debt <b>from liened property</b> that had been sold to others by the debtor after the loan was granted. One who lends money <b>by means of witnesses,</b> without recording the loan in a promissory note, <b>can collect</b> the debt only <b>from unsold property.</b>

Daf 175b

If one <b>presents to</b> a debtor a document in the <b>handwriting of</b> the debtor stating <b>that he owes</b> money <b>to him,</b> but without witnesses signed on the document, the creditor <b>can collect</b> only <b>from unsold property.</b>
In the case of <b>a guarantor whose</b> commitment <b>emerged after the signing of</b> the promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor <b>can collect</b> the sum only <b>from unsold property</b> of the guarantor.
The mishna relates: <b>An incident</b> occurred where such a case <b>came before Rabbi Yishmael, and he said:</b> The creditor can <b>collect</b> the sum <b>from unsold property</b> of the guarantor, but not from liened property that he has sold to others. <b>Ben Nannas said to</b> Rabbi Yishmael: The creditor <b>cannot collect</b> the sum from the guarantor at all, <b>not from liened property</b> that has been sold, <b>nor from unsold property.</b>
Rabbi Yishmael <b>said to him: Why</b> not? Ben Nannas <b>said to him:</b> If <b>one was strangling someone in the marketplace,</b> demanding repayment of a loan, <b>and another</b> person <b>found him</b> doing so and <b>said to</b> the attacker: <b>Leave him</b> alone <b>and I will give you</b> the money he owes, the person who intervened is <b>exempt</b> from paying, <b>as</b> the creditor <b>did not loan</b> the money in the first place <b>based on his trust</b> of the one who intervened. <b>Rather, who is a guarantor who is obligated</b> to repay the loan he has guaranteed? One who tells the creditor before the loan takes place: <b>Lend</b> money to <b>him, and I will give you</b> the repayment, <b>as</b> in that case the creditor <b>did loan</b> the money <b>based on his trust</b> of the guarantor.
<b>And Rabbi Yishmael</b> thereupon <b>said: One who wants to become wise should engage in</b> the study of <b>monetary law, as there is no greater discipline in the Torah, and it is like a flowing spring. And,</b> he added, <b>one who wants to engage in</b> the study of <b>monetary law should attend to,</b> i.e., become a disciple of, <b>Shimon ben Nannas.</b>
<strong>GEMARA:</strong> <b>Ulla says: By Torah law,</b> a creditor, <b>whether</b> in the case of <b>a loan with</b> a promissory <b>note or</b> the case of <b>a loan by oral</b> contract, can <b>collect</b> the debt <b>from liened property</b> that has been sold by the debtor subsequent to his receiving the loan. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? The property of a debtor at the time of the loan, even an oral loan, is <b>liened by Torah law. And what is the reason</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that one who gives <b>a loan by oral</b> contract can <b>collect</b> the debt <b>only from unsold</b> property? <b>Because of the loss</b> that would be incurred <b>by purchasers</b> of land if the seller’s creditors could seize the land they have purchased.
The Gemara asks: <b>If so, a loan with</b> a promissory <b>note</b> should <b>also</b> not be collected from purchasers of property, as this would cause them a loss. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of a loan recorded in a promissory note, the purchasers, who neglected to investigate the financial status of the seller before purchasing land from him, <b>brought the loss upon themselves.</b> By contrast, loans by oral contract are often impossible to discover, even with a thorough investigation.
<b>And Rabba says: By Torah law,</b> a creditor, <b>whether</b> in the case of <b>a loan with</b> a promissory <b>note or</b> the case of <b>a loan by oral</b> contract, can <b>collect</b> the debt <b>only from</b> the debtor’s <b>unsold property. What is the reason</b> for this? The property of a debtor is <b>not liened by Torah law. And what is the reason</b> the Sages <b>said</b> that one who gives <b>a loan with</b> a promissory <b>note can collect</b> the debt <b>from liened property</b> that has been sold? <b>So as not to lock the door in the face of</b> potential <b>borrowers.</b> If one could not collect a debt by taking liened property that has been sold, people would be hesitant to put their money at risk by lending it.
The Gemara asks: <b>If that is so,</b> that there is a desire to encourage people to lend money by granting greater power of collection to creditors, <b>a loan by oral</b> contract should <b>also</b> be collectible from liened property that has been sold. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> in the case of a loan by oral contract, <b>it has no publicity</b> associated with it, so that purchasers often cannot find out about it, even after a thorough investigation, and it would be an unfair burden on them to have the property purchased by them seized in such cases.
The Gemara asks: <b>And did Rabba</b> really <b>say this? But doesn’t Rabba say,</b> in the case of a firstborn son, that if he and his brothers <b>collected</b> a debt from <b>land, he has</b> the right to receive a double portion of that payment, but if <b>they collected</b> a debt from <b>money, he does not have</b> the right to a double portion? A firstborn son is entitled to a double share of inheritance of any property that was owned by his father at the time of his death, but not to profits or income that accrue to the estate after his death. If a debt owed to the father is collected from land after his death, Rabba said that the firstborn is entitled to a double portion, indicating that the land was considered in the father’s possession even before he died, which indicates that Rabba holds that the property of a debtor is liened to a creditor by Torah law.
<b>And if you would say:</b> The opinions as they were cited earlier are attributed incorrectly, and it is necessary to <b>reverse</b> the two opinions, and exchange the opinion of <b>Rabba for</b> that of <b>Ulla, and</b> that <b>of Ulla for</b> that <b>of Rabba,</b> there is a difficulty: <b>But doesn’t Ulla say</b> elsewhere: <b>By Torah law</b> the <b><i>halakha</i> of a creditor is</b> to collect his debt only <b>from inferior-quality land?</b>
The Gemara resolves the contradiction between Rabba’s two statements: <b>Rather, Rabba was stating an explanation for</b> the opinion of the <b>people of the West,</b> Eretz Yisrael, cited earlier (125a), <b>but he himself does not hold accordingly,</b> as he holds that a firstborn son is not entitled to a double portion of a debt collected from land.
The Gemara continues to discuss the issue of the extent of liens on a debtor’s property. <b>Rav and Shmuel both say:</b> In the case of <b>a loan by oral</b> contract, the creditor <b>can collect</b> the debt only from the one who took the loan, but <b>not from the heirs</b> of the debtor after his death, <b>and not from purchasers</b> of his property. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? They maintain that the property of a debtor is <b>not liened by Torah law.</b>
<b>Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish both say:</b> In the case of <b>a loan by oral</b> contract, the creditor <b>can collect</b> the debt <b>both from the heirs</b> of the debtor after his death <b>and from the purchasers</b> of his property. <b>What is the reason</b> for this? They maintain that the property of a debtor is <b>liened by Torah law.</b>
The Gemara <b>raises an objection</b> to the opinion of Rav and Shmuel from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Bava Kamma</i> 6:2): If <b>one was digging a pit in the public domain, and an ox fell on him and killed him</b> as he was in the pit, the owner of the ox is <b>exempt</b> from paying for the damage caused, as it is the one who dug the pit who is at fault. <b>Moreover, if</b> it occurred <b>that the ox died</b> as a result of the fall, <b>the heirs of the owner of the pit are liable to pay the value of the ox to its owner.</b> Compensation for damages is comparable to a loan by oral contract, and yet the <i>baraita</i> states that the heirs of the culpable party must pay it.
<b>Rabbi Ela says</b> that <b>Rav says:</b> The <i>baraita</i> is discussing a case <b>in which</b> the one who dug the pit <b>stood trial</b> for the damage before he died, and once judgment is rendered by a court, the resulting financial liability is comparable to a loan with a promissory note.
The Gemara objects: <b>But it is taught</b> in the <i>baraita</i> that the ox <b>killed him</b> by falling on him. How then can one say that he stood trial? <b>Rav Adda bar Ahava says:</b> The <i>baraita</i> does not mean that the ox killed him instantly, but <b>that it rendered him one who has a wound that will cause him to die within twelve months [<i>tereifa</i>],</b> and there was enough time before his death to try him and deem him liable to pay for damages.
The Gemara objects that there is a different version of the <i>baraita</i> according to which this interpretation is not possible: <b>But doesn’t Rav Naḥman say</b> that a certain <b><i>tanna</i> taught</b> the <i>baraita</i> with a different formulation, stating that the one who dug the pit <b>died</b> from the impact of the ox <b>and</b> the ox in effect <b>buried him</b> in the ground at the bottom of the pit? In this scenario it would be impossible to take the one who dug the pit to court to stand trial. The Gemara answers: <b>There,</b> according to that second version, it is discussing a case <b>where judges sat at the opening of the pit and deemed liable</b> the one who dug the pit to pay for the damage before he died.

Daf 176a

<b>Rav Pappa said: The <i>halakha</i></b> is that when a creditor gives <b>a loan by oral</b> contract, he can <b>collect</b> the debt <b>from the heirs</b> of the debtor after his death, <b>but he cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the purchasers</b> of the debtor’s property. He can <b>collect</b> the debt <b>from the heirs so as not to lock the door in the face of</b> potential <b>borrowers. But he cannot collect</b> the debt <b>from the purchasers, as</b> a loan by oral contract <b>has no publicity</b> associated with it.
§ The mishna teaches: If one <b>presents to</b> a debtor a document in the <b>handwriting of</b> the debtor stating <b>that he owes</b> money <b>to him,</b> but without witnesses signed on the document, the creditor <b>can collect</b> only <b>from unsold property. Rabba bar Natan asked Rabbi Yoḥanan:</b> If the document in the <b>handwriting of</b> the debtor <b>was ratified in court</b> at a later time, <b>what</b> is the <i>halakha</i>? Would it then be possible to collect the debt from liened property that has been sold? Rabbi Yoḥanan <b>said to him</b> in reply: <b>Even if</b> the document in the <b>handwriting of</b> the debtor <b>was ratified in court,</b> the creditor <b>can collect</b> the debt <b>only from unsold property.</b>
<b>Rami bar Ḥama raises an objection</b> from a mishna (<i>Gittin</i> 86a), which states: There are <b>three</b> types of <b>bills of divorce</b> that <b>are not valid</b> <i>ab initio</i>, <b>but if</b> the woman <b>marries</b> another man on the basis of one of these bills of divorce the lineage of <b>the offspring</b> from this marriage <b>is unflawed.</b> In other words, she is not considered to be a married woman who engaged in sexual intercourse with another man, which would impair the lineage of their child. <b>And they are these:</b> A bill of divorce that the husband <b>wrote in his handwriting but there are no</b> signatures of <b>witnesses in</b> the document at all; a bill of divorce where <b>there are</b> the signatures of <b>witnesses in</b> the document <b>but there is no date</b> written <b>in it;</b> and a bill of divorce where <b>there is a date</b> written <b>in it, but it contains only one witness. These are</b> the <b>three bills of divorce</b> that are <b>not valid</b> with regard to which the Sages said: <b>And if she marries,</b> the lineage of <b>the offspring is unflawed.</b>
<b>Rabbi Elazar says: Even though there are no</b> signatures of <b>witnesses in</b> the document, <b>but he handed it to her in the presence of</b> two <b>witnesses,</b> it is <b>a valid</b> bill of divorce. <b>And</b> on the basis of this bill of divorce the woman can <b>collect</b> the amount written to her in her marriage contract even <b>from liened property</b> that has been sold. This indicates that even when no witnesses signed the document, the debt listed therein can be collected from liened property that has been sold, as long as witnesses saw the document being transferred to the creditor. All the more so a debt listed in a document in the handwriting of the debtor that has been ratified by a court should be eligible for collection from liened property that has been sold.
The Gemara answers: <b>There</b> it <b>is different, as</b> the husband <b>obligated himself</b> and his property immediately <b>from the time of</b> the <b>writing</b> of the document, as he knew at that time that the document would be transferred in the presence of witnesses. By contrast, in the case of the mishna here, the document in the handwriting of the debtor was written without the intent of ratifying it. It was only at a later date, as an afterthought, that it was ratified, and the terms of the obligation of the debt cannot be changed at that time.
§ The mishna teaches: In the case of <b>a guarantor whose</b> commitment <b>emerged,</b> i.e., was written, <b>after the signing of</b> the promissory <b>note,</b> the creditor can collect the debt only from unsold property of the guarantor. <b>Rav says:</b> If the guarantor’s commitment is written <b>before the signing of the document,</b> the creditor can <b>collect</b> the debt from the guarantor <b>from liened property</b> that has been sold; if it is written <b>after the signing of the document,</b> the creditor can <b>collect</b> the debt only <b>from unsold property.</b>
At other <b>times, Rav said: Even</b> if the guarantee is written <b>before the signing of the document,</b> the creditor can <b>collect</b> the debt <b>only from unsold property.</b>
The Gemara asks: There is <b>a difficulty</b> resulting from the contradiction between one statement <b>of Rav to</b> the other statement <b>of Rav,</b> as they seem to contradict one another with regard to a guarantee that is written before the signing of the document. The Gemara answers: This is <b>not difficult. This</b> case, where Rav says the creditor can collect the debt only from unsold property, is <b>where it was written in</b> the document as follows: <b>So-and-so</b> is <b>a guarantor,</b> as this formulation is an independent statement, and the witnesses signing the document do not necessarily relate to that statement. And <b>that</b> case, where Rav says the creditor can collect the debt from liened property that has been sold, is <b>where it was written in</b> the document as follows: <b>And so-and-so</b> is <b>a guarantor.</b> The usage of the conjunctive: And, causes this clause to be an integral part of the document, so that the signatures of the witnesses relate to it as well.
<b>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says:</b> In <b>both this</b> case <b>and that</b> case, the creditor can <b>collect</b> the debt <b>only from unsold property.</b> The Gemara comments: <b>And</b> according to the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, this is the <i>halakha</i> <b>even if it is written in</b> the document: <b>And so-and-so</b> is <b>a guarantor.</b>
<b>Rava raises an objection</b> from a <i>baraita</i> (<i>Tosefta</i>, <i>Gittin</i> 9:9): In a case where <b>witnesses are signed on a greeting</b> written <b>in a bill of divorce,</b> the bill of divorce is <b>not valid,</b> as <b>we are concerned</b> that <b>perhaps</b> the witnesses <b>signed on the greeting</b> alone, i.e., they did not intend to testify to the divorce, but only to verify that the greeting was written.
<b>And Rabbi Abbahu said</b> concerning this <i>baraita</i>: <b>It was explained to me</b> personally <b>by Rabbi Yoḥanan</b> himself that it is only when the wording of the greeting begins: <b>Send a greeting</b> to so-and-so, that the bill of divorce is <b>not valid,</b> as this is an independent statement and it is possible that the signatures relate to it alone. But if the wording is: <b>And send a greeting</b> to so-and-so, the usage of the conjunctive: And, causes this clause to be an integral part of the document, and the bill of divorce is <b>valid.</b> This indicates that Rabbi Yoḥanan himself maintains that when the conjunction is used the signatures relate to the entire document.
The Gemara answers: <b>Here too,</b> when did Rabbi Yoḥanan say that the creditor can collect the debt only from the guarantor’s unsold property? <b>Where it was written: So-and-so</b> is <b>a guarantor.</b> If the conjunction is used, he can collect the debt even from liened property that has been sold.
The Gemara objects: But <b>if so, this is</b> identical to the opinion <b>of Rav,</b> whereas Rabbi Yoḥanan was presented as disagreeing with Rav. The Gemara answers: That presentation was inaccurate. <b>Say</b> instead: <b>And so Rabbi Yoḥanan says</b> as Rav did.
§ The mishna relates: <b>An incident</b> occurred where such a case <b>came before Rabbi Yishmael,</b> and he said: The creditor can collect the debt from unsold property of the guarantor, but not from liened property that the guarantor has sold to others. Ben Nannas said to Rabbi Yishmael: The creditor cannot collect the debt from the guarantor at all, not from liened property that has been sold, nor from unsold property. <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Although Rabbi Yishmael praised Ben Nannas</b> after hearing his dissenting opinion (see 175b), the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is actually <b>in accordance with</b> Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion as he stated it initially, i.e., that in the case of a guarantee that is written after the signatures, the creditor can collect the debt only from unsold property of the guarantor, but not from liened property that has been sold.
<b>A dilemma was raised before</b> the Sages: <b>What</b> would <b>Rabbi Yishmael say to me about</b> the case of the debtor who was being <b>strangled,</b> as depicted by ben Nannas? Perhaps he would agree in that case, since the guarantee was given under duress, that it is not valid. The Gemara suggests: <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as Rabbi Yaakov says</b> that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yishmael disagreed</b> with ben Nannas <b>also in</b> the case of the debtor being <b>strangled.</b>
The Gemara asks: And is the <b><i>halakha</i> in accordance with</b> Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion even in the case of the debtor being strangled, <b>or</b> is the <b><i>halakha</i> not in accordance with his</b> opinion in that case? <b>Come</b> and <b>hear, as when Ravin came</b> he said that <b>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Rabbi Yishmael disagreed</b> with ben Nannas <b>also in</b> the case of the debtor being <b>strangled, and</b> the <b><i>halakha</i></b> is <b>in accordance with</b> Rabbi Yishmael’s opinion <b>also in</b> the case of the debtor being <b>strangled.</b>
<b>Rav Yehuda says</b> that <b>Shmuel says:</b> If the debtor was being <b>strangled, and</b> in addition <b>an act of acquisition was performed with</b> the guarantor, the guarantor <b>becomes obligated</b> to repay the debt. The Gemara deduces: <b>By inference</b> it emerges <b>that a guarantor generally does not require an act of acquisition</b> to become obligated to pay. <b>And</b> this <b>disagrees with</b> a statement of <b>Rav Naḥman, as Rav Naḥman says:</b>

Daf 176b

<b>It is</b> only <b>a guarantor</b> who undertakes a loan guarantee <b>in</b> the presence of <b>a court who does not require an act of acquisition; this</b> indicates that <b>generally,</b> a guarantor <b>requires an act of acquisition</b> in order to be obligated to pay.
The Gemara concludes: <b>And the <i>halakha</i></b> is that <b>a guarantor</b> who accepts responsibility for the loan <b>at the time of the giving of the money does not require an act of acquisition;</b> but if he accepts responsibility <b>after the giving of the money,</b> he <b>requires an act of acquisition.</b> Moreover, <b>a guarantor</b> who undertakes a loan guarantee <b>in</b> the presence of a <b>court does not require an act of acquisition, as</b> in return <b>for that gratification that</b> he experiences in that the court <b>trusts him, he resolves to obligate himself.</b>
