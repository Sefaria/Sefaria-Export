"Until he woke up, he received support for the matter and Avimi expounded (Psalms 79) Mizmor Le'Asaf" - See Rashi, and Tosafot, and the Chiddushei Aggadot of the Meharsha z”l. In my humble opinion, it seems to be that the simple explanation is that regarding Avimi fulfilling the commandment of Kibud very well, that after he had brought the water requested of him, he added to that by standing over him until he awoke, that was not necessary except to fulfill the commandment on an extra level. He perceived this, and merited to understand Mizmor L’asaf. This is not Mizmor 79 that Rashi and Tosafot say, but rather Mizmor 73, which is the beginning of the words of Asaf, who says (Psalms 73:2-3) “But as for me, my feet had almost turned away, in an instant my steps would have been swept away. For I envied the perverse; I would see the tranquility of the wicked.” That whole Mizmor is about being very pained about the length of the exile, like it is also written, (Psalms 73:17) “Until I came to the sanctuaries of God, and I understood their end.” Almost all Mizmor L’asaf chapters are about the length of the last exile by the hands of the descendants of Esau, and that Mizmor ends, “You lead me with Your counsel, and after honor You receive for me.” And there is a Midrash (Yalkut Shimoni on Nach 808:12), “Said Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira, “You lead me with your counsel of the Torah, after (achar) honor You receive for me, the great honor that Esau did for his parents, that You will eventually grant us. Rav Huna said in the name of R. Nechunya, The honor of Jacob was delayed (icher) in this world, because of the great honor that Esau showed his parents,” see at length in the Yalkut. And what we find with Esau is exactly what is described in the story of Avimi, who got up for his father, and would always feed him and give him drink. And if so, with this did Avimi gain “support for the matter”, that he understood in the lines of Asaf in those Mizmors. That is, it states “Mizmor L’asaf” because all Esau had as good deeds was this honor, which gave him such prosperity in this world, and from  that you can learn the great merit of the righteous in this world and the next, which is how the Midrash ends, “After honor You receive for me,” that You will eventually grant to us. So it seems to me as correct, with God’s help, were it not for Rashi and Tosafot writing differently, that it refers to Psalm 79, and even according to what I wrote it makes sense to also refer to Mizmor 79, but it seems that the real main derash [of Avimi] is the beginning of the Mizmor L’asafs. And it’s possible that all of these are the same, and you should look and you will find, and perhaps the Omnipresent granted me from Heaven with this [idea].
