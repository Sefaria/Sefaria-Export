Daf 8a

In the Talmud, that "all was created for his honour" [second of the <i>sheva brachot</i>]. It's possible to explain this because the purpose of creation of the whole world was because of humanity, and in it creation was completed, as Chaza"l have said that Adam [humanity] was the last act of creation, and Adam was not completed until a partner was found for him. It turns out that Adam takes Chava in marriage and so completes creation; for this reason, we bless over creation, that "all was created for his honour". And we bless "who creates humanity" [third and fourth of the <i>sheva brachot</i>] twice, since as was said earlier, two creations arose in [God's] thought. And this is what is meant by "who created man in his image, in the image of his likeness his form" [fourth of the  <i>sheva brachot</i>]. And the Ritv"a" writes that "likeness of his image" is the form of humanity and should not be related to the form of God. And it seems that this is that He created with him [Adam] his image, and the image of her [Chava] was "the likeness of his image", for God created within him his soul. And it is said earlier that twice it arose in God's mind to create, and this is the creation of the souls in God's mind. But the body was created once, and after that God fixed for him [Adam] from his body an "eternal structure" [fourth of the <i>sheva brachot</i>] -- "eternal", and Rashi explains, a structure that will continue throughout the generations. It wishes to say that though in the beginning she was created from his side, from this she was established for the generations, that she will be birthed in her own right and in her wholeness, as God willed and intended originally. And it seems that because of this it was established for women to bless "who has made me according to Your will". It wants to say, that they were made in wholeness as God originally intended. And it is possible to further explicate the language of "eternal" [עדי עד], because of the verse in Ezekiel (16:7) "And thou didst increase and grow up, and thou camest to excellent beauty" [עדי עדיים]. Rashi explains, the language is "until you trust in God" - "eternal" wishes to say, all of the measure of growth that is appropriate for a whole stature, and so Chaza"l said regarding the rest of the works of creation.
