Daf 7b


Until Leah came, etc. As Rashi explains, and similarly as is explained in Bereishit Rabbah at length, see there. Since the verse doesn't give an explanation for her being thankful for the fourth child, the midrash expounds thusly. And it must be that she was not literally prophesying, for we see that Leah is not considered as a prophetess in the first chapter of Mas. Megillah 14a. Rather, without her knowledge, God put words in her mouth to predict the future. This is similar to what Rivka says in Gen. 27:45, "Why should I lose", etc., for she too is not listed as a prophetess. And similarly we can explain the upcoming midrash regarding Reuven.

Daf 8a

<b>All those occupied with Torah and acts of kindness and who pray, etc.</b> These three are the three pillars of the world, that we taught in a mishna "On three things the world stands: on the Torah, on the Service, and on acts of kindness" (Pirkei Avot 1:2). And this was at the time that the Temple stood, but now that the Temple is not standing, communal prayer is in the place of communal [sacrificial] service, i.e. the Tamid offerings which were brought every day. And the Holy Blessed One says, [this person has] redeemed Me and My children, etc. (Berachot 8a) -- for God's Presence is in exile, as it was written "I will be with him in distress" (Psalms 91:15). And also with all of the 30 "psalms of David" they said this pasuk, see there. God's Presence says, "He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle [קרב] against me" (Psalms 55:19), this is the language of those who are close [קרובים], that is to say my children.

Daf 27b



<b>When the masters of the shields enter, etc.:</b> It is explained in the name of the Arukh in Tractate Bekhorot; see there.
<b>How can the living contradict, etc.:</b> In the chapter [entitled] Kol Pesulei HaMukdashin (Bekhorot 36a), Rashi explained, "So I (Rabbi Yehoshua) retracted." And the Tosafot wrote there: That here it is impossible to explain [like this]; as behold, they established the law according to him. To here are their [words]. They wrote further there [that] here we do not teach [the version], "Stand on your feet and they will testify against you." See there.
<b>Shall we establish Rabbi Yehoshua? He was party to the incident, etc.:</b> Rashi explained: And there would be additional pain to Rabban Gamliel. To here are his [words]. But it can also be said that it is so they not say that he only disagreed with Rabban Gamliel for the sake of his [own] glory, and so they should appoint him in his place.

Daf 28a

<b>He said to her, "We elevate in sanctity and do not downgrade." [She said,] "Maybe he will punish you":</b> Rashi does not teach any of this [version]. And it appears that his reason is that this reason - we increase with holiness, etc. - is not correct. As behold, they took down Rabban Gamliel! Also the challenge, "Maybe he will punish you," is not correct, since they already said, "He is a tenth [generation descendant] of Ezra, so he has the merit of ancestors, etc." However it appears [nevertheless possible] to maintain [the version of] all the old books: As [regarding] what she said, "Maybe they will remove you" - she was not concerned whether they would do what was improper, God forbid, like they did to Rabban Gamliel according to her opinion. Rather, [her concern was that] "Rabban Gamliel appease them and they go back and appoint him and remove you, so that you will be embarrassed" - as it concludes later, "Remove him? We have learned, we elevate in sanctity, etc." Also that which she said, "Maybe he will punish you," is that she did not rely upon that which he had the merit of ancestors. It is as we say in general, "maybe [the falling away of merit] will be caused by sin." And it is easy to understand.
 <b>Any Torah scholar whose inside is not like his outside [will] not, etc.:</b> And that is why they compared it in the dream to jugs filled with ashes. As from the outside, the jug is whitened and complete, but on the inside, there is only ash in it - which is something lowly and not worthwhile. And in the chapter [entitled] Ba Lo (Yoma 72b), it explains that a student whose inside is not like his outside means that he occupies himself with Torah but he does not have the fear of Heaven with him. And there is no distinction to be made between the student [mentioned there] and the Torah scholar of here. And it is easy to understand.
<b>Sennacherib already arose, etc.:</b> It is explained in the first chapter of Sotah (9a) in the Tosafot and in our novellae there. 
<b>From the walls of your house it is apparent that you are a <i>pechami</i>:</b> See Rashi's commentary. And in the Sefer Yuchasin, [its author] wrote other explanations, see there.
<b>The one who wears the uniform (<i>mada</i>) shall wear the uniform, etc.</b> It is clear that the <i>mada</i> is a fancy garment that kings wear, as it is written (I Samuel 17:38), "And Shaul clothed David in his <i>mada</i>. And it is a cloak like Rashi explains; and as it is written (II Samuel 13:18), "for maiden princesses wore robes." And this is since Rabban Gamliel was from the descendants of the leaders and kings, from the Children of Yehudah. Whereas Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah was not so, as he was a priest. And it is only fitting for a king and a Nassi to be from the descendants of Yehudah. And this is as it is said in the first chapter of Sanhedrin (5a), "'The scepter shall not depart from Yehudah' (Genesis 49:10) - these are the Exilarchs in Babylonia; 'Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet' - these are the grandchildren of Hillel, etc." And Rabbi Yehoshua is [talking] about this, saying that the office of Nassi is returning to Rabban Gamliel by right, since he is from the descendants of the leaders; and it is not appropriate for Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah - who was a priest - to take the office of Nassi from him. And it is like they said, that the kings of the House of the Hasmoneans - who were priests - were punished for having taken for themselves, the monarchy that belongs to the descendants of David. And Rabbi Yehoshua spoke about the high priest to appease the mind of Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah with the opposite - that "one who sprinkles, son of one who sprinkles, etc." For the priesthood is given to the descendants of Aharon the priest, meaning to Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah. And [for] "one who is not one who sprinkles, etc." - meaning he is not from the descendants of the priesthood - the priesthood is forbidden to him; even to a king, as we found with Uziyahu, who contracted <i>tzaraat</i> for this. And just like no man can touch what is prepared for you, which is the priesthood - so too, you should not touch that which is prepared for your fellow, Rabban Gamliel, which is the office of the Nassi. And he brought that they would not say to a priest, "Your water is cave water and your ashes are, etc": That perforce we trust a priest about something that is related to the priesthood, meaning that it is purification water [that he is using], and not cave water which is disqualified from sprinkling; and we also trust a priest that he sprinkled the dust of a heifer and not burnt ashes - so too we should not be exacting with Rabban Gamliel concerning that which is related to his office of the Nassi. And it is easy to understand. 
 <b>Have you been appeased? Everything we did, etc.:</b> Meaning to say, since you have been appeased, we will also agree to the thing, to bring him back to his office of Nassi. For we only did [it], to remove him, for your honor. So behold, early tomorrow, you and I will go to his doorway, in the way that [people] arise early in the morning to [go to] the doorways of kings and important people - to show that it is our opinion to bring him back to his greatness. And if we go out, who will not go out? And it is easy to understand.
<b>Rather, Rabban Gamliel will lecture, etc.:</b> I did not understand this. This is since it was fit for each one of them to lecture one Shabbat; except they did not do this on account of jealousy, as 'two kings cannot use the same crown equally.' However it would be sufficient for Rabban Gamliel to have two weeks and for Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah to have one week - as then it would not lead to jealousy. And be precise and you will find it simple.

<b>A parable. To what can this be compared? A fox, etc.:</b> The explanation of the parable and the comparison is: The fox is the idolators, who are compared to impure animals everywhere. "And he saw fish" - these are the community of Israel, as it said, "I come from the offspring of Yosef, who were compared to fish. And it is said about all of Israel, as it is explained above. "And they are gathering from place to place" - that is, they form many communities. And the nets are the decrees and the persecutions that "people (<i>bnei adam</i>) cast upon them." Do not read <i>bnei (the children of) Adam</i>, but rather <i>bnei Edom</i> (the descendants of Edom/Esav, understood to be the Christians). And, "Do you wish to come up onto dry land," is from the water, which is a metaphor for Torah - as it is written (Isaiah 55:1), "Ho, all who are thirsty, come for water." So it means, do you wish to negate the Torah of Moshe, "and we will reside together just as they dwelt, etc." - meaning that we will be one nation. This is like the Caesar said to Rabbi Y. b H. in the chapter [entitled] Echad Dinei Mamonot. "Like my ancestors resided with your ancestors," with the negation of Torah - as it was with the destruction of the First Temple, as it is stated (Jeremiah 9:12), "Because they forsook my Torah, etc."
<b>And if in our habitat of life, etc.</b> - which is the Torah, which is compared to water - if we are getting lost, etc. This is like the metaphor of [the fish] going to the dry land. And it is easy to understand.
<b>Happy are you, Rabbi Akiva, etc.:</b> As this is certainly the full acceptance of the yoke of Heaven - as they said, "This is Torah and this its reward? 'From death, by Your hand, O Lord, etc.'" As he was killed on account of Torah study, such that this would be his reward. And Rashi explained: "From death" - he should have died by Your hands, and not by the hands of flesh and blood. To here are his words. The beginning of the verse is [thus] explained well; and the end of the verse, "from death of <i>cheled</i>" - meaning to say, he should have died in the way of all of the world. And <i>cheled</i> is an expression [for] world, as [in], "give ear, all inhabitants of <i>cheled</i>" (Psalms 49:2). And it is easy to understand.
<b>He said to them, "Whose portion (<i>chelkam</i>) is life," etc.:</b> He said, <i>chelkam</i>, in the plural, meaning the portion of all the righteous and their reward will not be in this world, but in the land of the living. Or its explanation is according to that which they said in Chagigah (15a), that the righteous takes his portion and the portion of the wicked in the Garden of Eden, as it is stated (Isaiah 61:7), "therefore in their land they shall possess double”; whereas the wicked takes his portion and that of the righteous in <i>Geihinnom</i>, as it is stated (Jeremiah 17:18), "and destroy them with double destruction." And now - to that which the ministering angels said, "and this is its reward" - the Holy One, blessed be He, answered them [that] the portion of the evil ones that killed him that they have in the Garden of Eden, which is the land of the living, will be his reward. And it is easy to understand.
