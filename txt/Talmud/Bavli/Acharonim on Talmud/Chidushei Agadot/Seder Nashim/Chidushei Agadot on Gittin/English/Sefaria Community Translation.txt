Daf 55b


<b>And whose enemy was bar Kamtza, etc.:</b> It explained with this that the beginning of the destruction was on account of baseless hatred, as it is written in the first chapter of Yoma (9a), "During [the time of] the Second Temple, when they were occupied with Torah [study] and with the commandments, on account of what was it destroyed? Because they had baseless hatred, etc." And it said... 
<b>He went and brought him bar Kamtza, etc.:</b> It was possible that this was a father and his son, and the messenger erred about them. And also that which bar Kamtza came even as he knew that he was his enemy, was because he reasoned that since his father was his friend, he certainly wants his friendship also, to make peace with him through this invitation. And it is as it is written in Eruvin (65a), "Whoever is appeased by his wine has in him the mind-set of his Creator, as it is stated (Genesis 8:21), 'And the Lord smelled the pleasing savor.'" And it is understood: One who has hatred against his fellow because he did something improper to him, and is appeased by his own wine - meaning he invited him to a drinking party that he made - has in him the mind-set of his Creator. For also the Holy One, blessed be He, was appeased to man who sinned towards Him with something that was His, since the whole world is His - as it is stated, "And the Lord smelled the savor, etc." - the pleasantness that he did His will, as the Re'em (R. Eliyahu Mizrachi) wrote. But the master of this feast did not have the mind-set of his Creator in him. So even after [bar Kamtza came by mistake, he said, "How is this; that man is the enemy, etc. And how did you err to think that I would invite you, since you are my enemy?" And he did not pay attention to any of his requests, as it concludes - until he took him with his hand and removed him by force. 

Daf 56a

<b>And he said, "Since the Sages were sitting and did not protest against him, etc.":</b> One can say that [when we say that] they did not protest because they did not have it in their power to do so, it's possible that they did [not protest] because of the false flattery that overcame that generation, as it is written in Sotah (41a) concerning King Agrippas.
<b>They sent them a three (year-old) calf, etc.:</b> He hinted to them that the accounting of the [golden] calf - "on the day when I make an accounting, I will take account" (Exodus 32:32) - was still in their hands, as it was with the destruction of the First Temple. [This is] as it is written in [the chapter entitled] Chelek, "Those who have charge over the city draw near, each man [bearing] his weapons of destruction" (Ezekiel 9:1) - that was the calf, as it is stated, "on the day when I make an accounting, I will take account, etc." And perhaps he said, a three (year-old) calf, with regards to the three [idolatrous] calves, as it is also written there: Until Yerovam, Israel was nursing from one calf; from then on, from three calves. And it said... 
<b>That he made a blemish on the calf’s upper [lip], etc. where according to us, it is a blemish, etc.</b> He hinted to them [in] that generation that they had people who were masters of evil speech, which is a blemish in the upper lip of man. "And some say he made the blemish on its eyelids" - since there were miserly (literally tight-eyed) people, which is a blemish in their eyelids; as is recognizable from this story. For he did not want that his fellow should benefit from his feast, and he even embarrassed him with words. And it said...
<b>They will say that blemished animals may be sacrificed, etc.:</b> As blemished animals may certainly be offered here in this way, for the sake of peace in the country. However they would learn to say that blemished animals like this can also be offered in a different [situation], that is not for the sake of peace in the country. "Through Rabbi Zekhariah ben Avkolas, our Temple was destroyed and our Sanctuary was burned, etc.": Even if exile had then [already] been decreed upon them on account of senseless hatred, it is possible that the Temple would not have been destroyed - that the [Roman] government would have spared it if its offering had been sacrificed. But now that it was not sacrificed, its anger was against the Temple. For it said, "I have no need for it."
<b>When he shot an arrow to the east, etc.:</b> He did this by way of divination when he was close to Jerusalem, as Rashi explained. But it appears according to its context, that he was standing in one of the four directions of Jerusalem and shot his arrows to the four directions. Yet if so, one of these four directions was towards Jerusalem, so there would be no novelty when it fell in Jerusalem, if he was close to Jerusalem. But it is possible that he was not so close to the city that he could shoot at the city, yet a wind carried it in a wonderous fashion until the city. 
<b>He said to him, "And I will lay My vengeance upon Edom, etc."</b> My vengeance - since they destroyed the house of the Holy One, blessed be He, with the Second Temple, and the revenge will be through My people, Israel; this is not like the First Temple, in which the revenge was not through Israel but rather through the Persian Empire. But for the future, it is stated (Ovadiah 1:21), "And saviors will come up out of Mount Zion, etc." And that is what he said, "The Holy One, blessed be He, wishes to destroy His Temple" - as if He did not want this, it would be impossible to destroy it with our hands. "And He wishes to wipe his hands with that man, etc." And it said...
<b>So he fled and became a convert, etc.:</b> See Sefer HaYechusin: So is it found in the Book of the of Kings' Chronicles - that Nero Caesar fled, etc. To here are his words, see there.
<b>There were these three wealthy people, etc.:</b> In Eichah Rabbati, this whole story is found in a different form: There the name, Nakdimon ben Gurion, is considered two [names of two people], so they are four wealthy people. And it said, "Nakdimon, because the sun pierced (<i>nakad</i>), etc." - it explains their names according to that which is written in the first chapter of Yoma about the Second Temple; that they were occupied with Torah [study] and with the commandments, etc. And that is why it said, "Since even their wealthy people were masters of good deeds. Nakdimon, because [the sun] pierced for him, etc. from his prayer" - as it is explained in Taanit. "Ben Kalba Savua, anyone who entered, etc." -  as his bread was available to all. "Ben Tzitzit, etc." - as he was careful about the commandment of fringes (<i>tzitzit</i>), as it is written about them (Numbers 15:40), "In order that you will remember [...] all of My commandments, etc." "There are those who say that his seat was found, etc." - so he was able to apologize for them in front of the government, if it were not because "there were zealots in it, etc.," as it concludes. And these were unbridled Jews who were among them, as is explained in Yossifon (Josephus). And from their hatred of one another, they caused the destruction and the exile. As they were not willing to submit to the Romans, as it says, "The Sages said to them, 'Let us make peace, etc.'" As they already knew [they could not win], for it was a sign from the Fathers to the children. As Yaakov said, "Let my master go before his servant, etc." (Genesis 33:14) - as it is explained in my Novellae on the Aggadot in the first chapter of Avodah Zarah. And that is why the Sages said, "You will not be successful in waging war against them." And it said...
<b>Marta bat Baitos was a wealthy, etc.:</b> It appears to me that this is not the Marta bat Baitos whom Yehoshua ben Gamla betrothed, as we learned (in a mishnah) in the chapter [entitled], HaBa al Yevimto (Yevamot 61a). As that was in the time of King Yannai, as we say there. And Yannai was much before the time of the destruction, as he was from the sons of the Hasmoneans, as is shown in several places. However in Yoma, Tosafot explained that this Yannai is not that Yannai who was from the sons of the Hasmoneans. As if so, he would not have established Yehoshua to be the high priest, for he himself was a high priest - as it said in the chapter [entitled] HaOmer.
<b>Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai read concerning her, "The tender and delicate woman among you who would not adventure, etc."</b> Because all of the matter is already written about a man (Deuteronomy 28:54-55), "The tender and very delicate man among you, his eye will be evil, etc.," except for this which is not written about a man. Rather it adds this thing about a woman who is extremely tender and delicate by nature, to hint about this woman.
<b>There is no fine flour, there is white, etc.:</b> It counted four types of bread here - because when the Temple existed, they would offer the thanksgiving breads, which were four types. It is based on, 'and does He need our bread?' Rather it is our provisions from the Table of the Most High, so that our livelihood be blessed with these four types of bread that are mentioned here. And when this offering ceased in the Temple - beyond their ingratitude in that they burned all their provisions - the four types of bread mentioned above were taken away.
<b>As Rabbi Tzadok observed fasts for forty years, so that it not be destroyed, etc.:</b> As forty years before the Temple was destroyed, the High Court (Sanhedrin) ceased, and they saw signs of the destruction with it; as we say in the chapter [entitled] Havu Bodkin, that forty years before the Temple was destroyed, the High Court (Sanhedrin) ceased. And be precise and you will find it simple. 
<b>All of her gold and silver, and threw it in the marketplace, etc. "They shall cast their silver in the streets":</b> It is relying on the later part of the verse, as it is written, "Their silver and gold shall not avail to save them in the day of the Lord's wrath; to satisfy their hunger, etc." And in the first part of the verse, "their gold," is not written concerning casting out. Rather it is written like this: And their gold shall be treated as something unclean, etc." And perhaps it is about the greatness of their sin with gold: As it is written in Yoma that Marta bat Baitos brought a large container of gold to King Yannai, to establish Yehoshua ben Gamla as the high priest. 
<b>And kill everyone through starvation, etc.:</b> Even though they said, "Let us go out and engage in battle against them" - nevertheless according to the opinion of the Sages, it would not [have been] successful. So since they burned the storehouse of wheat, the starvation was ascribed to them. And be precise and you will find it simple.
<b>And let no one else come in so that they not notice that you, etc.:</b> And about that which they would not let anyone else come in to him, they would not notice [anything]. For it is the way of the righteous to be exacting about this, like we find with Yaakov, that he commanded that only his children carry him, and not his grandchildren. And be precise and you will find it simple.
<b>Greetings to you, the king; greetings, etc.</b> As we double greetings to the king, as we say later on at the end of our chapter.
<b>I am not a king, etc.:</b> Rashi explained: And you mocked me. To here are his words. But were it not for his words, it appears that it is because he demeaned the honor of the [standing] king and caesar at that time.

Daf 56b

<b>As it is written, "And the Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one" (Isaiah 10:34). And a mighty one is only a king:</b> And according to the context above - "This same day at Nov, etc." (Isaiah 10:32) - the whole thing is stated about the fall of Sancheriv and his troops. However the homily (<i>derash</i>) here understands it to teach about the destruction of the Temple. For Lebanon is only the Temple. And it brings it from that which is written, "that good mountain and the Lebanon." For "that good mountain," with a definitive <i>hey</i>, is only said about Mount Moriah. As it was already chosen as good from our forefathers, Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov. And Lebanon refers to  the building of the Temple on this good mountain from wood of Lebanon. It is also because it is [related to the word], building (<i>binyan</i>) and whitens (<i>malbin</i>) - as Rashi explained.
<b>If there is a barrel of honey and a snake, etc.:</b> Honey is one of the liquids that is susceptible to [the problem of] revealing (leaving it open); and the snake is a snake that is wrapped around it until it is opened, such that it can put poison into it and injure a person. And he said, that we certainly break the barrel and damage it a little because of the snake, to kill it with the breaking of the barrel. But Rashi explained: In order for the snake to leave, etc. To here are his words. Yet this is not the meaning. For if so, what does he gain with the breaking of the barrel? And so too does it say about what he should have said, etc. - that "we remove the snake, and kill it, etc." And the comparison is that the zealots are the snakes, the city wall is the barrel and everything that is in it is the honey inside it. Even if the city wall is burned and there be some loss even to what is inside it, you gain through the death of the zealots.
And it said, <b>Who turns wise men, etc.:</b> It means to say that the iniquity of the people of the city is the reason that the Holy One, blessed be He, "turns wise men, etc." - so that they not have the mind to answer.
<b>He said to him, "Be not distressed, tidings, etc.":</b> It is possible that he caused himself distress, because he was thinking that the swelling was on account of an illness. And therefore when he said to him, "Good tidings, etc.," he said [back] to him, "But what is its remedy, etc." As he certainly had with what to make other shoes. It is just that he thought that it is nevertheless swelling, so what is its remedy? So he said to him, "Bring someone, etc." - with this you will see that it is not a [regular] swelling of sickness, since it does not require the same cure as that of another sickness. 
<b>He said to him, "Since you are so wise, why didn’t you come, etc.:"</b> He added to his question above, that "Due to your wisdom, you should have come to me to be saved from the zealots that you said to me were not letting you." So he answered him, "Even so, I told you - since they are also wise, we cannot save ourselves from them." So he said to him, "I also already told you," with the comparison above. 
<b>And he shall say, "Where is their God, Rock, etc." This is Titus:</b> This is like the words of Rabbi Nechemiah in the Sifrei, who said that Scripture was speaking regarding the nations. So the enemy, which is Titus, said, "Where is their God, etc." - which is like it ends, that he thought that he had killed "himself." And it also brings this verse - "they have set up their own signs for signs." For he thought that the signs and indications of killing a human, which is the release of blood, was also a sign for the killing of "himself."
<b>Who is strong like You, O Lord, etc.:</b> In the verse above it, it is written (Psalms 89:8), "and awesome upon all around Him." As he said that His trait is not like the trait of flesh and blood. As [a person] is accommodating towards his friends and exacting with his enemies. [Whereas] His trait, may He be blessed, is the opposite in this world. For He is awesome upon all those around Him, to be exacting with them to a hair's breadth, as we say at the end of Yevamot and in the chapter [entitled] HaParah. But concerning the wicked, it said, You are  "The Lord, God of hosts," to exact vengeance immediately. [Nevertheless,] "who is like You," in this trait, in that "You are strong" and indurate, "O Lord" - which is the name [of God in] the exile - to be silent and to be patient with them until their end comes, to destroy them from the world to come. As it ends, "a gnat came, etc." And it is the opposite of this with the righteous. And in this same way, it expounded, "Who is like You, O Lord, among the gods (<i>elim</i>), etc." [as], who is like You with this trait, to make himself mute (<i>ilem</i>) towards the wicked. And they expounded this teaching because we have not found <i>elim</i> without a <i>yod</i> (in any other place), such that it is from the word, <i>ilem</i>. And it said, "What did he do? He took the curtain, etc." As he certainly only cared to take the gold and silver vessels with him. But he took the curtain to be praised about the drop of blood, since he killed "himself" - which is what they did. And all of [the following] teaching is in the commentary of Rashi on Kohelet (Rashi on Ecclesiastes 8:10). However, he did not bring that which they expounded here in his commentary - collected (<i>kevutzim</i>) instead of buried (<i>kevurim</i>) - and he left it as, buried, like its meaning. See there. And it is possible that it is because he did not see a rationale to expound, "Do not read, 'buried (<i>kevurim</i>)'; rather read, 'collected (<i>kevutzim</i>).'" For we do not find a <i>tzadi</i> changing to a <i>reish</i> in any place. But, "Do not read, 'and were forgotten (<i>veyishtakechu</i>)'; rather, read, 'and they were praised (<i>veyishtabechu</i>),'" was fine with him. For the <i>bet</i> does change to a <i>kaf</i>, from the root of the writing (the two letters looking similar). And it appears that it can be explained homiletically that, "Do not read, 'buried (<i>kevurim</i>)'; rather, read. 'collected (<i>kevutzim</i>),'" is not exact. Rather it is that the meaning of <i>kevurim</i> is gathered - as in <i>kibura de'ahini</i>, which they explain as an expression of a grouping of dates.
<b>And he said that their God has power only in water:</b> He meant to say, even if He swore to [never] bring a flood to the world, that is not their God. Rather "their God has power only in water.  Pharaoh rose, etc." He said to him, "Wicked one, etc., grandson of Esav the wicked, etc." Even though it is the Roman Empire that sent him, it was a tradition in their hands that the destruction of the Second Temple was through the seed of Esav, as is explained in several midrashim. And we have already written about this - that the first king was Tzefo, the son of Elifaz, as is explained concerning Ben Guryon, etc. 
<b>A gnat came, entered his nostril, and picked at his brain, etc.</b> This punishment came to him because he blasphemed and cursed [God] with his words, which comes from the faculty of breath which came through the nose to the brain. As it is written (Genesis 2:7), "And He blew into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living being"; and Onkelos translates [this as,] "a speaking being." And the matter of its picking at his brain, etc. and it heard the sound of a hammer and was silent, can be explained [as] a hint from the verse that it brought above (Psalms 74:4), which stated, "Your enemies roar, etc. He was known like one bringing up for stature." Meaning, he was known by the curtain that he brought to his city, that should be for his stature, to be praised for it in his city. Or it means, "like one who brings the Elevated" - as it said, "he thought that he had killed "himself." So it said that his punishment is that "the axes are caught in the tree" (the end of Psalms 74:5): Just like the axe picks at the tree, so too did the gnat pick at his brain. And also according to Abbaye - as its mouth was copper and its claws were iron - it was like this axe. And it stated (Psalms 74:6), "its entrances" - since there was a little consolation and opening, since the idolater and the Jew together, "broke away with the hatchet and with the hammer," to silence it with the sound of the hammer. And it said, "they split open his head, etc." - according to one, like a pigeon - that is a hint to the Congregation of Israel. As it is written about the visions between the pieces, "Bring Me a heifer, etc., a turtledove, and a young pigeon, etc. and he split them in the middle [...] but he did not split the bird" (Genesis 15:9-10): That is a hint that the idolaters will end, but Israel will survive. And that is what it stated in this Psalm (Psalms 74:19), "Do not deliver Your dove to the wild animal, etc." - it is the "turtledove, and [the] young pigeon."
<b>And he said, "Scatter my ashes across the seven seas, so that the God of the Jews should not find me, etc.":</b> The seven seas are according to the seven climates, based on the seven planets. And this wicked one blashpemed towards the Above - that He does not have power in the seven seas, but rather gave [their] governance to the seven planets above, "so that God should not find him, etc." - since He does not have governance over them. And there is also a hint to this in the [Psalm] that it brought [above]. As it stated (Psalms 74:10), "Till when, O God, will the foe blaspheme, etc." He blasphemes even after his death, that Your governance is not on the seven seas. "But God is my King from of old, etc." (Psalms 74:12). As You already showed Your power and Your salvation in all of the seas. For, "You drove back the sea with Your might (<i>ozecha</i>), etc." (Psalms 74:13). That is hinting to the angel of the sea, who is called Uza - that You drove him back with Your governance. And "You split open springs and torrents, etc. You made mighty rivers run dry, etc." (Psalms 74:15) - for Your power is in all of the seas and the rivers. And it stated (Psalms 74:16), "The day is Yours, the night is also Yours, etc."  - meaning to find [something] in darkness as in light, and [that] there is nothing hidden from in front of Your eyes. That is the opposite of what he said, "So that the God of the Jews should not find me."
And it said, <b>He said to him, "Their words (commandments) are numerous, and you will not be able, etc.":</b> He denied that the Torah was from the Heavens: For it is impossible that it be from the Heavens, since it is impossible to fulfill all of it; and its words are like words in general. And there is also a hint to this in that [Psalm]. As it stated further (Psalms 74:18), "Remember this, O enemy who blasphemes the Lord, etc." As it states (Psalms 74:19), "Do not deliver [Your dove] to the wild animal" - which is Israel, Your dove, as I have written. For it is impossible to keep it all, since forgetfulness is found among people. So "do not forget forever," the answer that You promised us, "your poor ones" - which are Israel. It is as it is written (Deuteronomy 31:21), "for it shall never be forgotten from the lips of their progeny, etc." And it said, "Anyone who distresses Israel will become, etc." - that is explained in the Aggadot of [the chapter entitled] Chelek.

Daf 57a

<b>You shall not seek their peace or their welfare, etc.:</b> He was not so evil as to say, "Go and battle against them to distress them," but rather, "You shall not seek their peace. etc." And it is as it is written about the nations that the Holy One blessed be He, distanced us from clinging to them - meaning Ammon and Moav. As it is stated about them (Deuteronomy 2:9), "do not provoke them, etc." - to cause them evil. But it is also stated about them (Deuteronomy 23:7), "You shall not seek their peace, etc." And according to what is written in the midrashim, Bilaam is the same as Lavan. And it was already said to him (Genesis 31:24), "do not speak to Yaakov either good or evil." For the goodnesses of the wicked are bad for the righteous. And perhaps this too was hinted in those verses:  "Remember that You are blasphemed by scoundrels (<i>naval</i>) all day long" (Psalms 74:22). <i>Naval</i> is the same letters as Lavan, who is Bilaam. And it stated, remember Your blasphemy from him all the days. For he said, "You shall not seek, etc." - as it is written about Moav. And it ends with the two [of them] (Psalms 74:23), "Do not forget the voice of Your foes" - which is Titus; but also do not forget "the din of Your adversaries that ascends (<i>oleh</i>) all the time" - which is Bilaam, since he brought several burnt-offerings (<i>olot</i>), in order to curse Israel. And this is simple to understand.
<b>And he said to him, "He is sentenced to boiling semen, etc.":</b> See the commentary of Rashi. But it can also be said that it was based on that which he slept with his donkey, as we say in Avodah Zarah. 
<b>Anyone who touches them is as if he were touching the apple of, etc.:</b> It is understood that anyone who touches the apple of his eye destroys its sight; so too one who touches them for evil, destroys and extinguishes the light of the world, as it written in this manner, about Herod in the first chapter of Bava Batra.
And that which it said, <b>Anyone who mocks the words of the Sages will be sentenced to excrement, etc.:</b> It is like the commentary of Rashi, who expounds it like this from, "much study (<i>lahag</i>) is a weariness of, etc." (Ecclesiastes 12:12). But there (Eruvin 21b), this teaching is rejected, because it is not written, "mocks (<i>laag</i>)." Yet it appears that the one that expounds it [does so] because the letter, <i>ayin</i>, switches with a <i>hey</i>, according to [the letter scheme], <i>aleph-chet-hey-ayin</i>. And since he disgraces the words of the Sages, he is sentenced to disgrace in excrement. And it appears that this is the explanation of that which is written, "much study": That [Kohelet] already stated about the words of the Sages (in the same verse), "be careful [of] making many books, etc." - that is that they should make a fence to the Torah with their books. [Hence] whoever mocks them about doing this a great deal to erect fences will be sentenced to "weariness of the flesh." And this is simple to understand.
