<b>He said to them, "My sons, remove the vessels, etc. as [I can] guarantee":</b> And he was not concerned about that [issue] of Rav Adda above, "As perhaps they will not do a miracle for him, etc." - which is, lest a sin cause [that he not be deserving], as I wrote above. But Nachum of Gam Zu considered himself a wholly righteous person - as they said, "Since you are a wholly righteous person." They said this to him based on that which is written in Tractate Berakhot  (7a), "The righteous person who suffers is one who is not a completely righteous person. The righteous person who prospers is a completely righteous person." And since you are a completely righteous person, why has such great evil befallen you? So he answered, "My sons, I brought, etc." As certainly even because of that which I told him, "Wait, etc.," I should not be liable for so great a punishment. As did I know that he would die in such a minute time? However I brought it upon myself, to accept such a punishment upon myself. As this is the way of the righteous, to accept afflictions upon themselves in this world, so that their reward be complete in the world to come. So they said to him, "Woe to us that we have seen you like this, etc." This is according to what is said in Tractate Moed Katan, "If it is so with the moist, what will they do with the dry?" If such a punishment came to you for a light sin, woe to us for our many iniquities! So he said to them, "Woe is me if you had not seen me [like this]" - meaning to say, if I had not accepted my punishments in this world.
<b>This too is for the good, etc.:</b> In like fashion, we say in the chapter [entitled] HaRoeh (Berakhot 60b) that, "One must always accustom oneself to say, 'Everything that [God does, He does] for the best.'" And there it is brought from verses; and it means to say [that] even that which appears bad in the eyes of man - it is possible that, from the Heavens, it is done for the good. And there, they bring the story of Rabbi Akiva with this; and see there in my novellae there and in the chapter [entitled] Chelek. 

Daf 21b



Daf 22a




<b>When we see sad people, we joke around, etc.</b>: That through this, they merited the world to come; as we say in the chapter [entitled] Nigmar HaDin (Sanhedrin 46a), "When a man is in pain, the Divine Presence says, 'My head is [too] heavy for me, etc.'" See there.

Daf 22b



Daf 23a



<b>In the manner that Habakkuk did, etc.:</b> As everyone who prays stands in one place! But since it is written about him with a double expression - "I will stand and set myself, etc." - it implies that he made a circle in the place that he prayed, so that he not move from there until he was answered. And an <i>ugah</i> is a circular line, like Rashi explained. And he was called Choni HaMe’aggel based on this; meaning that he encircled himself with a circular line. 
<b>Like a member of the household:</b> This is according to what is written in the chapter [entitled] Ain Omdin (Berakhot 34b:28) - that the wife of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai said to him, "And is Chanina greater than you, that you need to request from him that he pray for your son?" And he said to her, "No, but he is like a servant who is accustomed to the house of the king, whereas I am like a minister in front of the king" - as it is explained there. And so too here, this is what he means: It is not because of my greatness that they directed their faces towards me (for help), but rather since I am like a member of the household, accustomed to being before You.
<b>Only to dissolve your oath, etc.:</b> And even though he said in his oath, "until you have mercy upon Your children, etc." - it is possible that the students only heard the expression of the oath from him, "that I will not move from here"; but they did not hear the end of his words, such that he said, "until you have mercy, etc." So they thought that he only prayed that the rain fall; and that was fulfilled!
<b>Rain of [good]will, blessing, and generosity, etc.:</b> Meaning to say, of Your will - as it is said, "May it be Your will, etc."; and that it should also be the will of Israel, such that it not fall furiously. And blessing is that it be a blessing for You and a blessing for us. And [generosity] is that which they said in the blessing for rain, "and generosity for You" - that it not be by way of an obligation. And that it be generosity (<i>nedevah</i>) for us - as it stated (Psalms 54:8), "Then I will sacrifice to You with a freewill sacrifice (<i>nedevah</i>); I will praise Your name, Lord, for it is good, etc." That is why he brought a bull of <i>hodaah</i> (thanksgiving).
<b>Over an excess of good, etc. Bring me a bull, etc.:</b> It appears that it can be explained that the reason of the thing, that we do not pray over an excess of good - even though this good of excess rain is bad, as I wrote above, since it weakens the land, so it doesn't produce fruit - because it is nevertheless like ingratitude. For at the beginning, he prayed and requested rain, which is good for the world. Yet he said, "Bring me a bull of <i>hodaah</i>," upon which to confess [sins], as Rashi explained. That is to confess that he did not act properly, by requesting the stopping of excess good. But "Israel, whom You brought out of Egypt" - he made the thing depend upon His taking them out of Egypt. As You grew angry with them [and] they could not withstand [it] - for example, the trials of water and Mei Merivah. [And] they were not able to withstand the flow of excess good to them - for example, with the manna and the quail. They were not able to withstand [it], as it is stated about it (Numbers 11:33), "The meat was still between their teeth, etc. when the anger of the Lord flared up, etc." 
<b>Wouldn’t the name of Heaven have been desecrated by you, etc.:</b> See the commentary of Rashi. However the expression, "desecrated by you," would appear to be better explained [as], that you would come to a false oath, since the key to stop the rain is in the hands of Eliyahu.
<b>As you <i>mitchateh</i> (nag) before the Omnipresent, etc.:</b> Rashi explained [it as being] from an expression of sin. But Arukh explained it as something else, see there.
<b>About you, the verse states, "Your father and mother will be glad, etc.":</b> Your father is your Father in Heaven and your mother is the Community of Israel. "And the one who bore you will rejoice" - that is his actual father and mother who bore him. 
<b>A generation that was in darkness, you have illuminated [...], "When they cast down, etc.":</b> It would appear that they mentioned four things which are one matter, [simply in order to synch it] according to the verses. But it can be said (answered) that it mentioned the order of all of his deeds with this, like the order mentioned earlier. So it said first that they had not seen rain at all - it was "a generation that was in darkness, [that] you have illuminated with your prayer," since they saw the beginning of the rain. But it was still a cast down generation, as it says that a small amount of rain came only "to enable you to dissolve your oath." That was until "you lifted it up with your prayer," that the rain should come with great abundance. But it was still "humble eyed" - as it said, "it appears that rain is falling only to destroy the world." This was until  "you saved it through your prayer," such that [the rain] fell as it should. But it still did not cease, until they ascended to the Temple Mount on account of the rain, since the generation was not innocent. This was until "you delivered it through your prayer," such that the rain ceased. And it concluded, "'And he will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands'; through the work of your clean hands." This hints to the bull of confession that he brought and placed his hands upon, like the explanation of Rashi.
 <b>A song of <i>Maalot</i>, etc.</b> Rashi explained, it is an expression of ascending (<i>iluy</i>). To here are his [words]. But in the chapter [entitled] HaChalil and in Tractate Makkot, it is explained that it is based on the fifteen ascending steps (<i>maalot</i>) in the Temple, in the courtyard. 
<b>"We were like those who dream" - he said, "Is there someone who sleeps seventy years, etc.":</b> For there is no dream without sleep. And Rashi explained, seventy years at one time. To here are his [words]. And even though, dream (<i>cholmim</i>), is in the plural; dream, nevertheless indicates it is without a break. And if so, it perforce must be a different [type of] sleep. And the matter is that it makes a comparison of the years of the exile, as if they were only like this dream. And in the same way, the years of a man - which are seventy years - are compared to dreams, as it is written in Job (20:8), "He flies away like a dream, etc.," And according to this, it can be explained that it was from this difficulty -  is there someone who sleeps seventy years, etc. - that [Choni] explained the verse, that they were like dreamers: Meaning, when we were in the Babylonian exile, we were like dreamers [for] seventy years - like the years of a man, which are only like that which "flies away." And he was distressed about this, that the world of a man only be considered like a dream that has no substance. And it said, that "he was walking along the road when he saw a certain man planting a carob tree, etc." That is that they showed him that just like this carob tree is not considered anything for seventy years, but we [still] plant it to give fruit after seventy years; so too was man created on the eve of Shabbat that he toil in his deeds for seventy years, but the eating of the fruit and his reward is after seventy years - in the world to come. And that which they said, "[I] found this world with carob trees, etc." - this world is compared to a carob tree. So even if he made efforts, sometimes he will not merit to eat from it, to be alive after seventy years; nevertheless, his son will merit to eat from it. So too is the action of a righteous person in this world: Even if it is a world that he [only] passes through, nevertheless his son will eat his fruits, like he [would] - as it is written (Exodus 20:6), "But I do kindness for thousands (of generations)." And it said, "Sleep overcame him, etc. and he slept for seventy years": As they also showed him with this that the simple meaning of the verse - "we were like those who dream" - was certainly something possible. And that is like it said, "I understand from this, that I slept seventy years." And he also saw that his grandson was eating fruit from the carob tree, to confirm for him the matter above - that the main fruits of a man's deeds in this world are to be eaten after seventy years.  
<b>And they did not pay him proper respect, etc.:</b> Even when they saw that he was a master of Torah and "his discussion is enlightening us as if it was in the lifetime of Choni HaMe’aggel" - they nevertheless did not see about him that he was a master of [good] deeds like Choni. And that is why they did not pay him proper respect. And it said that he prayed for mercy and he died, etc. As his time to die had not yet arrived, since those seventy years that he was sleeping were not counted for him at all. And in the Yerushalmi, it brings a story about Choni HaMe’aggel, that he was [alive] during the destruction of the first Temple and he slept seventy years from the destruction of the first Temple until the Second Temple was built; whereas this story of the mishnah was a long time after this, at the time of Shimon ben Shetach. And the author of Yafeh Mareh wrote that there were two Choni HaMe’aggels, and the one of the mishnah was his grandson, see there. And in the Sefer Yuchasin, it is written in the name of Yosef ben Gurion that Choni HaMe’aggel was killed outside of Jerusalem in the wars of the descendants of the Chasmoneans. And this agrees with our Talmud: Since he was lost from the world for seventy years, sleeping, they said about him that he was killed in the civil war. And that is why when he came, even his grandson did not believe him.

Daf 23b



Daf 24a



Daf 24b



Daf 25a

<b>She had entered to bring a shovel, because, etc.:</b> See Rashi's explanation. And the explanation of his explanation appears to be that it wanted to say that, because she was accustomed to miracles - that is the reason why she had a bread shovel in her house at all, given that she had nothing to bake. And it is saying,  because she was accustomed to miracles, that is why she had a kneading basin, such that she not need to borrow from her neighbors. And that which it said that she saw a kneading basin full of dough, etc. - it is possible that she did not have a kneading basin at home. Rather all of this was through a miracle, so that her neighbor would not sense that there was no kneading basin and dough here. But with the bread shovel itself, it is implied that it was [already there] without the miracle, except that she had it in her room.
<b>One leg of a table, etc.:</b> It appears that the hint in this is as they said (Avot 1:2), the world stands on three pillars, on Torah, on service and on acts of lovingkindness. For the world was created on account of these three pillars, so that one merit life in the world to come through them. And these are the three legs and feet of the table that will be for the goodly reward of the righteous in the future. And it said that he prayed for mercy to give him from his reward in this world. So they gave him one leg - which was the reward for prayer, which is service.  For he was praying now, and he was accustomed to pray like this for every trouble, that it not come - as is explained in several places. And they showed him in his dream that, because of this, he will be lacking one leg - which is the reward for prayer and for service -  in the world to come.
<b>Pray for mercy, etc.:</b> And they took it, so that he would have his full reward in the world to come. And it said, "The [last] miracle was greater, etc., as [...] it does not take, etc." And that is like the matter that they said in the chapter [entitled] Bameh Behemah (Shabbat 55a:5), "Never did a good attribute emerge from the mouth of the Holy One, Blessed be He, and He retracted it, etc."
<b>One <i>bei shimshei</i> (twilight):</b> Rashi explained, "It was Shabbat eve, but I have not heard the reason [it is called this]." To here are (his words). But it appears that the twilight (literally, between the suns) here and in the chapter [entitled] HaNosei concerning Rabbi - that he would come to his house every <i>bei shimshei</i> - is the hour of the coming of Shabbat, meaning when it is still day and the sun is [out]. For one must add from the mundane to the holy (by bringing in Shabbat while it is still Friday). And that is why that hour is called, between the suns. And it is like it was said, "Sun on Shabbat is charity for the poor," as explained earlier (Taanit 8b:12). And it appears that this too is [why] we call Friday, the eve of Shabbat - it is also because of that hour of the bringing in of Shabbat. It is because the eve of the day is considered Shabbat on account of the addition of the mundane to the holy.
<b>It burned the entire day, etc.:</b> She did not need it to burn the entire day, but rather only on Shabbat night, because of domestic peace. But it burned the entire day to publicize the miracle to the masses during the day; also [to publicize it was] that they came to light the light of the commandment of havdalah from it. 
<b>If they are damaging us, etc.:</b> He knew the truth, that they were not causing damage. For if not, he would not have relinquished the goats to the bears, given that [the goats] were not his - as [is seen] later. Rather he should have guarded them from doing damage, since he was the guardian of a lost object. 
<b>Until they jutted out a cubit from this side:</b> This too was to publicize the miracle. For even one who did not know and did not hear about this miracle - when he would see this house that was differentiated from other houses, that there would be a cubit from this side, etc., he would ask about it, and they would tell him about the miracle. And that is what is implied, as behold the [statement] of Palaimo was brought about this - "I saw, etc. And they said to me, 'This is the house that was roofed, etc.'"
<b>And Rabbi Chanina ben Dosa, from where did he have goats, etc.:</b> All of this, until, "And these are the very goats that brought, etc.," are from the words of Ein Yaakov. It appears that it is not from the [words] of the Talmud, but rather from commentaries written in the style of the Gemara. You will also find difficult, that which it said, that he sold the chickens and the eggs and bought goats with their value, etc. - this is still difficult, how did he buy goats with their value? And is it not that we do not raise small, domesticated animals in the Land of Israel? More correct are the words of the Tosafot that are written in Ein Yaakov - that the goats themselves were the found object. So he was the guardian of [that] lost object, etc. See there, in Ein Yaakov
