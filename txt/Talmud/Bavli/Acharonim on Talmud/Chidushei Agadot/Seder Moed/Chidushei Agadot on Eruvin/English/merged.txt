Daf 13a

"Lest you omit" etc. "or add a single letter, you will destroy"etc.

There are those who understand this teaching according to its literal understanding.  Since the entire Torah is one of God's names, omitting one letter would destroy everything.
The mystical way explains that Torah is comprised of Black fire overlaid on White fire.  It was through these that the Holy One created and maintains the world.  If a single Torah letter were missing, the world would cease to exist.

Daf 13b

13b--"in halacha"etc. R' Meir's peers were unable to understand the summation of his wisdom and the halacha is not in accordance with his opinion.  Despite this, R' Meir revealed much Torah to them for both sides of an argument.  This is how he enlightened [me'ir] their eyes, so that afterward they they could determine what is truly true and affix the halacha accordingly.
