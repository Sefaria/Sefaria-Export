<b>The orchard, etc.:</b> See the commentary of Rashi and of Tosafot. And in the Arukh, he explained: They called it an orchard, [because it is] like the matter of the Garden of Eden, which is hidden away for the righteous. So too is this place one of pleasantness to which the souls of the righteous are bound. To here [are his words]. And they also wrote that it is because of this that it said about Acher, that he chopped down the saplings of this orchard. And see about all these things in the Ein Yaakov at length in the name of Rabbenu Chai Gaon, see there.<br> <b>And in an old book</b>, I found [the following]: They entered the orchard of wisdom, and that is the wisdom of the Divine. Ben Azzai glimpsed and died from the clinging of his soul with great love - a true clinging - to supernal things which are its foundation. So it glimpsed at this shining light and separated from the body and became rarified from all occurrences of the body. At that time, it saw that rest was good. So it did not return to its place. And this is a great level. That is why it it is stated (Psalms 116:15), "Precious in the eyes of the Lord, etc." And this is not like the words of the commentators that he saw the Divine Presence and died, as it is stated (Exodus 33:20), "a man may not see Me and live." For if it is [like the previous explanation], you have made Ben Azzai greater than our teacher, Moshe, peace be upon him. Ben Zoma glimpsed and was harmed, because he was not complete in his virtues and in his presence of mind, like Ben Azzai. And because he also glimpsed at the bright light more than his mind could withstand, the things became confused for him and his mind was impaired (he went insane). It is a like a man who is impaired, since he cannot grasp things clearly. And this is [the meaning of], "lest you become full from it and vomit it." And Elisha/Acher grasped that the merits of Israel were in the hands of [Meitatron] and thought there are two authorities. And that is why it is said that he chopped down the saplings, since he chopped down unified things and separated them from one another. And he said that they were two authorities, and that is included in worshipping other gods. And that is why he is called, Other (Acher). And one who understands the secret of other gods understands this clearly. And that which it said that they removed Meitatron and smote him with sixty rods of fire - this is what they showed Acher according to his burning thought - to make known to him that there is only one Authority. But it can also be said that, they smote him with sixty rods of fire, is that they added to the power of the consuming fire of the great fire above to decree a difficult decree against Acher. For if you do not say like this, what did Meitatron do [to deserve this]?
<b>Rabbi Akiva ascended in safety and descended in safety;</b> with regard to him, the verse states, "Draw me after you, etc." As Rabbi Akiva was complete with all types of completeness. So when he reached the boundary of the human intellect which it is impossible to [pass], he stopped and did not act destructively to climb towards God. And that is why it is stated about him, "Draw me after you, etc." It means to say, he was drawn after the Drawer, but he did not enter beyond the boundary. And even though he grasped what Acher grasped, he did not make his mistake, etc. To here [are the words of the old book].


Daf 15a

<b>Who was standing, etc. and ben Zoma saw him and did not stand, etc.:</b> And in the Yerushalmi, we teach [the version] that he was walking on the path and Ben Zoma came across from him. [Rabbi Yehoshua] greeted him and he did not answer him, etc. And according to this, it is fine like its simple meaning - that when he was so preoccupied with the way, Rabbi Yehoshua said to him, "From where  are you coming and to where are you going?" But according to the version of our Gemara (Bavli), in which he did not stand before him, see the explanation of Rashi. But it can also be explained that Rabbi Yehoshua thought that he did not stand before him because he was being haughty, [thinking] that it is not fitting for him to stand before Rabbi Yehoshua. Hence he said this expression to him - "from where and to where, Ben Zoma" - for a person should not be haughty. Rather he should consider that his creation was lowly: 'From where - from a putrid drop; and to where are you going, to a place of dust, etc.' So he said to him, "I was looking, etc." - from preoccupation with the contemplation, my mind did not allow me to get up before you.
<b>Between the upper waters and the lower waters:</b> There are differing opinions about this: Some of them say that the firmament that divides between the lower and the higher waters are the planets, and that is the opinion of the Ramban. And he was prodigious in bringing many passages about the truth of this idea. And it is [also] the opinion of Rashi, may his memory be blessed, in his commentary on the Pentateuch. For he wrote (Rashi on Genesis 1:6:2), "'In the midst of the waters' - in the middle of the waters; because there is distance, etc." But the Rabbi of the Guide (Rambam in the Guide for the Perplexed) explained that the firmament is the place where the cloud exists. And at first glance, this statement of Ben Zoma only fits the explanation of the Rabbi of the Guide. And likewise did Re'em (R. Eliyahu Mizrachi) write about the verse, "in the midst of the water," and [Rashi's comment,] "in the middle of the waters, etc." And he wrote at length there: However that which is in Chagigah about Ben Zoma - that he said, "I was looking at the gap between the upper waters and the lower waters, etc. a mere three fingers"; and Rabbi Yehoshua said to his students, "Ben Zoma is still outside, etc." - he held that the firmament is speaking about the firmament of air (cloud). And the explanation [of the verse (Genesis 1:6)], "Let there be a firmament," is [hence,] there should be a firmament, like it sounds. And therefore they said that between the upper waters of the firmament and the lower waters, there is only three fingers according to the one, and like a hair's breadth according to the other. And from this, it is a wonder about [Rashi], may his memory be blessed, how he disregarded the Gemara and took hold of the words of Aggadah from Bereishit Rabbah. To here are the words of the Re'em. But in my opinion, this verse can fit with both explanations. For 'one thing God has spoken; two things have we heard.' For one verse can be expressed with several explanations. And from this, what Ralbag understood in the opinion of the Guide is incorrect and [these are his words]: And the Rabbi of the Guide already explained [that] the firmament is the place in which the cloud is found, since it was strange to him that water would be found above the frame of the heavens. To here [are his words]. For the [Rambam] also conceded this. And [the reason] he mentioned, air, and did not mention, the waters above the frame of the heavens, is because, waters, is only stated there as a metaphor. And a metaphor is from that which is different then the matter itself. And this is the explanation that Rabbi Akiva gave, "When you reach pure marble stones, do not say, 'Water,' as it is stated, 'He who speaks falsehood. etc.'" - like the Ralbag himself fully wrote. And both [opinions] are in the same [passage of] Scripture, "Praise the Lord from the Heavens, etc." (Psalms 148:1) - these are the heavens of the air. And afterwards, it is written (Psalms 148:4), "Praise Him, heavens of the heavens" - and these are the planets. And afterwards, it is written, "and the waters that are above the heavens." And so does the Re'em explain. And with this, it is explained [how] Rashi, may his memory be blessed, brought (Rashi on Genesis 1:8) in the explanation of [the word], heavens (<i>shamayim</i>), "Carry water (<i>Sa mayim</i>)" - and these are the words of Bereishit Rabbah; but afterwards, he wrote, "water is there (<i>sham mayim</i>)" - and these are the words of the Talmud, Chapter 2 in Chagigah (12a:19): "Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said, '<i>Shamayim</i> is <i>sham mayim</i>. It was taught in a baraita, '<i>Shamayim</i> is <i>esh oumayim</i> (fire and water), since the Holy One, Blessed be He, brought them both, mixed them together and made the firmament with them.'" For these statements and their explanations do not contradict one another. Rather it is that the [statement in] Bereishit Rabbah mentioned there the matter of the waters above the planets and so it perforce explained that those heavens are <i>sa mayim</i>; since the waters are carried above by them. But our Talmud was speaking about the heavens of the air, like the statement of Ben Zoma. Perforce the explanation of those waters is <i>sham mayim</i>, because the agitation of the water is there. And so did the Re'em explain. And that which it said, <i>esh oumayim</i>, is because the heavens of the air are the place that the cloud comes to exist. And some of them are clouds of fire and some of them are clouds of water. As we have found, "and fire flashing in the midst of the hail" (Exodus 9:25), such that the hail and the fire were mixed together. Hence it is understood that these heavens were fire and water that the Holy One, blessed be He, mixed with one another. And the author of the Makor Chaim wrote like this idea regarding water and fire, that He mixed one with the other. And with this, there is no room for wondering why Rashi seized the words of the Aggadah and left over the words of the Gemara in Chagigah. As Rashi is not contradicting them. For if that was not so, he should not have brought the statement of Chagigah, "<i>sham mayim</i>," and "<i>esh oumayim</i>," since it is an explanation of the heavens of the air - as I have written. Rather he is explaining the verses with ideas that are close to its simple understanding. And this is the way of Rashi, may his memory be blessed, in several places - as the Re'em, may his memory be blessed, wrote in several places. However in the aggadot in the Yerushalmi in Berakhot (1:1:24), we say: It has been taught in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua, "The thickness of the sky is two fingers." The words of Rabbi Chanina disagree, as Rabbi Acha said in the name of Rabbi Chanina "'Spread the skies with Him; they are strong like a cast mirror' (Job 37:18) - 'spread,' teaches that they are made like sheet metal. I could think that they are not sturdy, that is why the verse says, 'strong, etc.'" To here are [its words]. And it is implied that it is speaking about the heavens that are the planets, and not the heavens of the air, for it is arguing there with one who holds that the width of the heavens is the distance of 500 [years]. And if so, according to this, it appears that it can be said that the statement of Ben Zoma, according to its simple meaning, is speaking about the waters above the planets. And the opinion of Ben Zoma - such that he said that the gap between the upper waters and the lower waters is a mere (two) fingers - is like the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua there, that the width of the planets is two fingers. And that is what separates between the higher and the lower waters. And the one [here] who holds that it is like the width of a hair holds like Rabbi Chanina, that the width of the firmament that separates between them is only like sheet metal. And then there is no other way [to understand] the verse and Ben Zoma's statement besides the explanation of Rashi; and not that it is the firmament of the air, which is an approach that is far from the simple meaning of the verse. And the author of Yafeh Mareh wondered about the Re'em, and these are his [words]: And in my eyes, my studies should be separated from the like - how could he believe that our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, explained, firmament, [to be] the air; and the upper and the lower waters in this way, etc.? See there, and this needs [further] study.  
<b>With regard to him, the verse states (Ecclesiastes 5:5), "Do not let your mouth bring your flesh into guilt," etc.:</b> In the Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Talmud Chagigah 2:1:10), they bring it about that which they said there, "He saw children, etc. He said, what are those sitting doing here?" See there; and the Tosafot cited this. And that is that he was causing the children to sin with the words of his mouth. And they called that, "your flesh," etc. However it is remote. And in our discussion in the Talmud, they do not cite this [story] at all. And it appears that it can be explained about our topic according to that which it says in a different place (Sanhedrin 38b:19) that a heretic asked Rav Idit, "[It is written] (Exodus 24:1), 'Come up to the Lord.' It should have been, 'Come up to Me.'" [Rav Idit] said to him, "This is Meitatron, whose name is like the name of his Master - as it is written (Exodus 23:21), 'for My name is in him,' etc." - as it is explained there. As this heretic inclined towards duality and Rav Idit answered him that there is no duality here, God forbid. Rather this is the Master and that is the student, but his name is like the name of his Master, as it is written, "for My name is in him." See there. And it is likewise here: Even though there is no sitting for the angels, but rather only for Him, blessed be He, alone, may He be blessed - as it is written (I Kings 22:19), "I saw the Lord seated upon His throne, with all the host of heaven standing, etc." - nevertheless because his name is the same as the name of his Master, he was granted permission to sit and write the merits of Israel. But Acher did not know [this], and thought like the opinion of that heretic, that there is a duality, such that there is another one that sits besides the Holy One, blessed be He. That is like it says, "there are two authorities." And it is [also the explanation of] what he said, "There is a tradition that in the world above there is no sitting" - as it is written, "I saw, etc., with all the host of heaven standing, etc." "And no competition" - as it is written (Job 25:2), "He makes peace in His heights." This is like the liturgical poet expressed, "Michael placed the snow, Gavriel the fire, etc." "No turning one’s back" - as it is written (Ezekiel 1:6), "And there were four faces to one" - meaning, on each side [of the angel]. "And no lethargy" - as it is written about the righteous (Isaiah 40:31), "But they who trust in the Lord, etc.; as eagles, they shall grow new plumes, etc.; they shall march and not grow lethargic." And if it is so with the righteous in the world to come, all the more so is it with the angels. So now, that which it said, "With regard to him, the verse states, 'Do not let your mouth,'" etc. - it should be explained that it is [relating] to the end of the verse, "nor say before the angel," which is Meitatron, that he is sitting, so there are two authorities. As he is called an angel, as it is written (Exodus 23:20-21), "Behold, I will send an angel before you, etc., for My name is in him." And it is with regard to the mistake of Acher that it said, "nor say [...] since it is an error." For he erred due to the sitting of Meitatron. But that "God be angry at your voice," is that you believed in a duality, "since it is an error" that is considered a wanton sin. For one should not contemplate this: "Perhaps, God forbid, there are two authorities." And it says at the end [that Meitatron] was given permission to erase the merits of Acher. And that is the end of that verse, "and destroy the work of your hands" - and those are the good deeds that he already did and those are his merits. He destroyed them through this evil thought, to believe in a duality, God forbid.
<b>So they struck him with sixty rods, etc.:</b> They explained in Tosafot: To make known to him that Meitatron does not have more power than the others. To here are their [words]. It appears that they needed this [reason], and the reason that the Talmud said - because "when you saw him, you did not stand before him" - was not sufficient for them. As the punishment of lashes is not relevant for angels except as an illustration, and it was to show to Acher that "Meitatron does not have power, etc." And this is what the Talmud was saying, "What is the reason" that they hit him even as an illustration? [The answer is that] if he had stood before him, there would have been no need to make known to him that there is no power to Meitatron. But now that "you did not stand before him," you caused him to err, that there are two authorities. So in order to remove this from Aher's mind, they struck Meitatron - to make known to Acher that there is no power, etc. But he nevertheless did not recant on his evil thought, as it concludes.
<b>A Divine Voice went forth saying, "'Return, rebellious children' (Jeremiah 3:22), apart from Acher," etc.:</b> And likewise he said later, "I have heard behind the curtain, etc." And the wording in the Yerushalmi is: Once I rode on a horse on Yom Kippur which fell out on a Shabbat and I heard a Divine Voice going forth from the house of the holy of holies, saying, "Return, children, apart from Acher - since he knew My power and rebelled against me." To here [is the Yerushalmi]. But he nevertheless should not have paid attention to the Divine Voice about this. And it is like Rabbi Meir said to him during his sickness, "You bring back a man, up to extinction (Psalms 90:3)." And we say, "You have nothing that stands in front of repentance."
<b>What is that which is written (Ecclesiastes 7:14), "God has [made] the one as well as (<i>leumat</i>), etc." He created mountains, He created hills, etc.:</b> According to its context, it appears that the word, "as well as," is referring to something equal to it, such as mountains and hills that have equal height. And likewise with seas, etc., seas and rivers. And likewise with the matter that is written (Nehemiah 12:24), "one watch as well as [the other] watch." And there are many [examples] like this. And [regarding] that which he said, "He created the righteous, He created the wicked," the word, "as well as," does not refer to the righteous and the wicked, since they are not equal. Rather they are a matter and its opposite! However, the partial equality [indicated] should be explained as being that He created the righteous and He created the wicked, He created the Garden of Eden, He created <i>Geihinnom</i> - in that He created for each what is relevant to it. And [regarding] what it said, "Each and every person has two portions, etc." - it is that since free choice is given to man to be righteous or wicked, since everything is in the hands of the Heavens besides the fear of the Heavens; and the Holy One, blessed be He, does not deprive the reward or punishment from any creature - therefore He created [enough of] the Garden of Eden for all of them in case they are all meriting. And likewise did He create [enough of] <i>Geihinnam</i> for all of them in case they are all unmeriting. And [regarding] that which it said, "If he merits [it], the righteous one takes his portion and the portion of the wicked one in the Garden of Eden" - it relates to the teaching of Rav Masharshia later on. And it can also be said that it is relating to the end of that verse, which ends with, "to the end that man should find nothing after him." And, "after him," is referring to the righteous and the wicked - that when the wicked one dies, he will find nothing of his portion in the Garden of Eden, since the righteous one has [already] taken it. And likewise the opposite, when the righteous one dies after him, he will find nothing of his portion in <i>Geihinnam</i>, since the wicked one has [already] taken it.
<b>It is written (Isaiah 61:7), "therefore in their land they shall inherit double, etc.":</b> And the end of the verse is, "Joy shall be forever (<i>leolam</i>, which can also mean, for the world), etc.," - meaning for the world to come, since it is called the 'land of the living.' And with the wicked, it is written (Jeremiah 17:18), "And destroy them with double destruction" - and that is <i>Geihinnam</i> in the world to come.
<b>Acher asked, etc., after he had gone astray, etc.:</b> It was precise about his question, that it was after he had gone astray, etc. As his intention was about himself, as it concludes, "they have a remedy even when they have broken, etc." - except that he had heard, "apart from Acher." And likewise should it be explained above, when it said, "after he had gone astray, he said to him, 'What is that which is written, "He has made even the one."'" For his intention was about himself, regarding that which he said, "Since [I have] been banished from that world, let [me] go out and enjoy this world." That is as it concludes, "Since he had been banished from that world" - meaning that of the future - and another righteous person would take his portion, it is better for him to enjoy in this world, that portion that would have been his in the Garden of Eden in the future.
<b>What is that which is written (Job 28:17), "Gold and glass cannot equal it, etc.":</b> Concerning gold, etc., it can certainly be explained that it is regarding the characteristic of importance that the Torah is compared to it - as it is written (Psalms 19:17), "which is more beloved than gold and fine gold." But with glass, what importance is there to it? So he said to him, that here it is not concerning the quality of importance that the Torah is compared to them them, but rather it is that "words of Torah are as difficult, etc. and as easy, etc." But he said to him, "Rabbi Akiva, your teacher, did not say so"; rather it is that the Torah is compared to gold and glass [regarding only] one quality: That they have a remedy.
<b>For I have already estimated according to the steps of my horse, etc.:</b> Rabbi Meir, who was walking  behind him on foot, certainly knew better how to estimate with his [own] steps, since two thousand ells (the limit it is permitted to walk outside the city) are [the same as] two thousand steps of a person. So it is possible that he said this to him by way of mockery - that he estimated according to the steps of the horse. But [they had] not yet [reached] the Shabbat boundary. And he said this to have him go away from him. And it said, "he took hold of him and brought him, etc." It means to say that Rabbi Meir grabbed him and brought him to the study hall - perhaps he would reverse himself and repent, etc.
<b>He said to him, "There is no peace, said the Lord, concerning the wicked":</b> In coming there to the study hall, in which it is the way to seek out the peace of one arriving, the child said this to him, "There is no peace, etc." And the second one said to him, "For though you wash with niter, etc., yet your iniquity is marked, etc." (Jeremiah 2:22). He hinted to him that his repentance would not help him, like the Divine Voice had said, "Return, rebellious children, apart from Acher." And the third one said to him, "And you, spoiled one, what are you doing, etc., that you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, etc.; in vain you make yourself fair" (Jeremiah 4:30) - meaning that even the ornaments and beauty of the Torah that you have will not help you. And similarly did the fourth say, "And to the wicked, God says, 'What is it for you to declare, etc.'" (Psalms 50:16). And this verse is expounded, in the chapter entitled Chelek, about Doeg. And see there in our novella. And this verse chanced upon a child who had a stutter, such that he said it [as if it was with the name of] Elisha, Acher.

Daf 15b

<b>He should not be judged [...] because he occupied himself, etc.</b> Behold, Acher was certainly among the Jews who have rebelled with their bodies, about whom we say [in] the first chapter of Rosh HaShanah, "They descend to <i>Geihinnom</i> and are judged there for twelve months. After twelve months, their bodies are consumed, their souls are burned, etc." [In that case,] his Torah [study] would have protected him from the judgement of <i>Geihinnom</i> - as it said, "because he occupied himself with Torah." And it is as it is written (Proverbs 6:22), "in your laying down, it shall protect you, etc." <b>Nor brought into the world to come:</b> For he had no merit for him to merit the world to come. And Rabbi Meir requested the opposite of this for him - that he be judged for his sins in <i>Geihinnom</i>, and that he merit the world to come because of his Torah. It is as we say in the world, that it is not seeming that the teacher be in <i>Geihinnom</i> and the student be in the Garden of Eden. As Rabbi Meir was a student of Acher, as per the below.
<b>I will cause smoke to rise up from his grave, etc.</b> How many wicked people are there who die and are judged to <i>Geihinnom</i>, yet we do not see any smoke rise up from their graves!?! But it is possible - based on what they said, "'You shall decree a thing, and it shall be established unto you' (Job 22:28); that the righteous make a decree and the Holy One, blessed be He, fulfills [it]" - that here too, Rabbi Meir requested this: That Acher should be judged and that smoke should rise up from his grave, to make known to the masses that the decree of Rabbi Meir was fulfilled. And so too can it be said in the chapter [entitled] Arba Mitot about Rabbi Akiva, who brought up smoke from the grave of the father of the evil Turnus Rufus except on Shabbat, to show him that this day is the Shabbat day. It also appears that in this story from here and from there that even though smoke rose up from the grave in which the body is found, it is about the burning of the soul in <i>Geihinnom</i> that is fit for them, as it concludes [that we are dealing with <i>Geihinnom</i>, and not just the grave]: "Even the guard at the entrance, etc." - which is the guard at the entrance of <i>Geihinnom</i>, like Rashi explained. And it is also as we say [in] the chapter [entitled] Chelek, that the Holy One, blessed be He, brings the soul, throws it into the body and judges them together, as it is stated (Psalms 50:4), "He calls to the Heavens, etc."
<b>A mighty deed to burn his teacher, etc.</b> Even though he did this for the good of his teacher so that he would merit the world to come; nevertheless, according to how it would appear to those seeing it - that he was burning his teacher, and they would not see that he would merit the world to come - there is no good to his teacher here. And also if it is good for his teacher from the angle that he will merit the world to come, behold it is bad for him that he will be judged. And it is [even] possible that he prefers that he not be judged and that he not be brought to the world to come - like the metaphor, "Not from you honey, and not from your sting!"
<b>Is there still of his seed, etc. "Neither son nor grandson, etc."</b> How many evil people did this and still have descendants in the world!?! And it is possible that, according to Rebbi, this is worse, since he knows his Master and [still] rebels against Him, as it is written in the name of the Yerushalmi. 
<b>Fire descended and licked, etc.:</b> This fire is hinting to his Torah, which is called a doctrine of fire; and like she said to him, "Remember his Torah."
<b>What is that which is written, "For the priest’s lips, etc." If the rabbi is similar to an angel, etc.:</b> This is its explanation - that a priest is from the tribe of Levi [and] is an instructor of Torah. So he teaches it to Israel, as it is written, "They shall instruct your laws to Yaakov, etc." And it said [that] even if he protects the knowledge on his lips to teach you Torah - if you seek to learn Torah from his mouth, [first] see if he is similar in his deeds to an angel.
<b>He found a verse and expounded, "Incline your ear, and hear, etc.":</b> Since all the limbs of a person are created to do the will of their Maker, especially the ear - that it heed to listen to the words of sages. But other vessels and active limbs in a person, among which the heart is the main one, would not listen to the opinion of the sages every time, lest they [sometimes] be evil. Rather, "the heart" - and all of the other limbs - [should] "pay attention to my wisdom." This means to [act for the sake of] the Heavens. And likewise the verse that it brings, "Listen, daughter" - which is the Congregation of Israel - "and consider," to incline "your ear" to the sages, about which the foundation of this psalm is stated: "For the leader; on <i>shoshanim</i> (lilies)" - like the explanation of Rashi there (that lilies refer to the sages). But the other limbs - do not heed them, lest they are evil; so "forget your people," meaning your evil deeds.
<b>Rabbi Meir ate a half-ripe date and threw the peel away, etc.:</b> Here it compared what Rabbi Meir learned to a fruit on the outside and his throwing away the pit inside. Yet later, it made the opposite comparison, that he ate the insider of the pomegranate, and he threw out the outer shell!?! But it can be said (answered) that Acher was incomplete, both in his traits - like we said above, "he found a prostitute, etc."; and in his convictions - like we said above that he thought that there were two authorities. So it was saying that Rabbi Meir distanced himself from both his bad traits and his bad convictions. And now, concerning traits, it said that he ate the outer fruit - meaning the Torah that he learned with him, which was revealed. But he did not want to accept from him, the mud that was in his heart in his internal convictions, such as two authorities; so he threw them away. But concerning his traits and the bad deeds that he did, which were revealed - such as that which he found a prostitute, etc. and he uprooted a radish on Shabbat - it said that Rabbi Meir distanced himself from them, as we said earlier concerning the Shabbat boundary. And that is the peel that he threw out. But the commandments that are in the Torah that he learned from him, which are compared to the seed within the pomegranate - as they said, they are full of commandments like a pomegranate - those Rabbi Meir ate, meaning he fulfilled [those] commandments of the Torah. And adjacently, it compares the Torah scholar to a walnut, [comparing] the inner fruit in it to the Torah in him and the peel of the walnut that is undesirable to the [bad] deeds: This is certainly that the Torah, which is among the convictions, is called internal compared to the traits and deeds of a person, since they are revealed externally.
<b>He said to him, "Now He is saying, 'My son, Meir, says, "When a person suffers, etc."'":</b> He means to say here, that it is specifically to this matter itself that the matter of Rabbi Meir is related - as it said, "If the Holy One, Blessed be He, suffers over the blood of the wicked, how much more so, etc. And the matter of, "Woe is Me from My head, woe is Me, etc.," is explained in our novellae in the chapter [entitled] Nigmar HaDin (Sanhedrin 46a).
<b>"Where is he who counted," etc. all the letters of the Torah. "Where is he who weighed," the minor and major, etc. for they would teach three hundred, etc.</b> This is explained in the chapter [entitled] Chelek.
<b>Acher, what was it? Greek tunes never ceased from his mouth, etc.:</b> And Rashi explained: And he should have desisted on account of the destruction of the Temple - as it is written (Isaiah 24:9), "They drink their wine without song." To here [are his words]. But [then] it should not have said, "Greek tunes," but rather just, "tunes never ceased, etc." - as it is said there in Tractate Gittin, "From where [do we know] tunes are forbidden, etc." It also does not appear that there would be a [great enough] blemish in him on account of songs after the destruction [to] cause heresy. So it appears that it mentioned, "Greek tunes," because there was heresy in the tune itself. And in this fashion, they said at the end of the chapter [entitled] Merubah that Greek wisdom is forbidden, and the reason is because it draws [one] to heresy. And about this, that which they brought, "They said about Acher, '... many heretical books, etc.,'" is fitting. They meant to say that there were heretical books with him; but when he would come to the study hall, he would cover them in his lap and hide them from the sight of the students who were in the study hall. But at the end, due to his preoccupation with his study there, he forget to hide them when he got up from his place - as he had been sitting - and they fell from his lap onto the ground in front of the students in the study hall.
<b>[Does] all wool that enters, etc. that was clean when it was with its mother, etc.</b>: See the commentary of Rashi and Tosafot. But in the Arukh, in the entry, "<i>Aamar</i>," it explained that it was clean with its mother: Meaning, all that wool that is clean, and not dirty with mud, absorbs the dye properly. So Rabbi Akiva, [who] was proper from the beginning, ascended in safety and descended in safety. But Acher, who was inadequate from the beginning, did not descend in safety. To here are its [words]. And it appears that it can be explained from that expression that it used, "clean with its mother," that it hinted with it to that story that is found in the Yerushalmi: That Abuya, the father of Acher, designated him for Torah [study] on the day of [his] circumcision, but his intention was not for the sake of the Heavens. And that is why it did not stay with him, as he went astray. And this is [the meaning of] what they said, that Acher was not clean when he was with his mother - meaning close to his birth on the day of circumcision, his father intended to teach him Torah not for the sake of the Heavens. And that is why he did not exit in safety. ...
<b>With regard to him, the verse states, "Draw me, we will run after you, etc.":</b> It is referring to the [continuation] of this verse, which continues with, "The king has brought me to his chambers." This means that he came in safety to the chambers of the enclosures on high, as it is explained in the words of Rav Hai and in the Arukh, see there. And I found in an old book - and these are its [words] - Rabbi Akiva was complete with all types of completeness. So when he reached the boundary that the human intellect is not able to reach, he stopped and not did not cause destruction, [by trying] to ascend to the Lord. And that is way it stated about him, "Draw me after you, etc." - meaning to say, he was drawn, but he did not not go past the boundary. To here are its [words].
<b>Leave this Elder, for he is fit to use My glory, etc.:</b> It appears from this wording like the explanation of Rashi - that that which they had entered the orchard and ascended to the firmament to attain [understanding] there, was [by way] of their using the holy names [of God]. And therefore the ministering angels said that it is not fitting to use His holy names, so they sought to push him and injure him, like his three colleagues had been injured - until the Holy One, blessed be He, said to them, "Leave this Elder, for he is fit to use My glory" - meaning the glory of the name. 

Daf 16a

<b>"What verse did he expound, etc. "and He came from the holy myriads, etc.":</b> The Arukh explained: He is distinguished among His myriads - meaning there are none among the angels similar to Him. But [R. Akiva] saw angels similar to Meitatron, so he knew that he was not the Holy One, blessed be He. To here are his [words]. And this agrees with Rashi's second explanation: What did he expound, that he did not err like Acher erred. To here are his [words]. Meaning that he erred about Meitatron sitting, thinking that there were two authorities.
<b>He is exemplary among the myriad, etc.:</b> It is explained in the Arukh that he is exemplary - that there is none like Him in all of his myriads, whereas Rabbi Akiva saw angels that were similar to Meitatron. Hence he did not err, etc. To here are his [words]. Meaning to say that he did no err like Acher.
<b>"The Lord of hosts is His name"; He is the Master, etc.</b> Meaning to say - similar to the earlier teachings - that Rabbi Akiva did not err like Acher about two authorities,as Acher thought, but rather that the Holy One, blessed be He, is the sole Master in all of His host. And it appears that these teachings were learned out from these verses: One master derives it from, "And He came (<i>ve’ata</i>) from the holy myriads." Since according to its plain sense, it should have written <i>ouva</i> from the holy myriads," in [Hebrew]; and not, "<i>ve’ata</i>," in [Aramaic]. And hence he expounded it as being from the expression, <i>ot</i> (sign). And the master that derives it from, "preeminent (<i>dagul</i>) above a myriad," as He is exemplary (<i>dugma</i>), etc. - it would be forced to [say] that from the expression,<i>dagul</i>, he expounded it to be an expression of <i>dugma</i>. As we have not found the exchange of the [letter], <i>mem</i>, with the [letter], <i>lamed</i> [anywhere else]. Hence it appears that we can say that he learns it from [the meaning of] "preeminent (<i>dagul</i>) above a myriad" - just like the bearer of the flag (<i>degel</i>) is recognizable on his own, so too is the Holy One, blessed be He, recognizable and differentiated from [the angels]. However because there are those above the bearer of the flag in an army - such as the king and his ministers - that is why he said that, that which he compared Him to the bearer of the flag, is only an approximate example: That he is distinguished by his flag from all the members of the army, so too is the Holy One, blessed be He, distinguished from all of His myriad. For He is one, and not like the mistake made by Acher. And the [last] one expounds it from, "The Lord of hosts is His name," because according to its plain sense - that He is the Lord to two hosts, the host above and the host below - it should have written, "The Lord of hosts is He." And hence he expounded, "He is the Master in His host." And hosts (<i>tzevaot</i>) is [here then like] two words, <i>tzava ot</i>, as He is the Sign of the host (<i>ot be'tzava</i>) of above. And in the explanation in the Arukh on the entry <i>ot</i>, it is like I have written above.
<b>And Rabbi Chiya, etc., but the Lord was not in the wind, etc., and behold, the Lord passed by, etc.:</b> So is it in the version of the Gemara that is in front of us. But the version in the Ein Yaakov erases this [part of the] verse - "and behold, the Lord passed by." And that is because that [phrase], "and behold, the Lord passed by," is written before the [phrase], "but not in the wind, etc." Except according to his amendment, what teaching is there here? For it only brings the verse, "and not in the fire," as it is written. And it appears that we can validate all of the versions of the Gemara, according to its content. As Rabbi Chiya bar Abba in the name of Rabbi Yochanan brought the teaching that Rabbi Akiva did not err like Acher from here. And that is that the Holy One, blessed be He, is differentiated from all of His hosts above, and His place is recognizable. For it is written, "But the Lord was not in the wind, etc." - which are the angels of the winds; "the Lord was not in the earthquake" - which are the angels of the earthquake; "the Lord was not in the fire" - which are the angels of fire like the explanation of Rashi there. Rather His place is recognizable in the still, small voice. "And behold, the Lord passes" then. And according to this intention of his, he reversed [the order of] the phrases. As, "behold the Lord passes over," that it written before it, refers to what is is below - that after the fire, there is the still, small voice. And then that is the sign that the Lord is passing.
