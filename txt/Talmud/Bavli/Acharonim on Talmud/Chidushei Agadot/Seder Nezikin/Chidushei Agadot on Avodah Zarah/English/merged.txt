Chidushei Agadot on Avodah Zarah



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Daf 2b



Daf 3a











...There is a question to be asked here. (Although there is disagreement over the calendar date of the giving of the Torah,) Everyone agrees that the Torah was given on the 51st day of the Counting of the Omer. The intention here was that since the Jewish People were not prepared to receive the wisdom of the Torah until they purified and sanctified themselves  from the impurity of Egypt, as is written in Pirkei Avos, “All whose fear of Heaven precedes his wisdom, his wisdom will be upheld.” Therefore, since the purity happened on the 50th day, Hashem established the 50th day as the Holiday of Shavuos because fear of Heaven comes before wisdom.

Daf 10b

<b>Because it is written, "for a bird of the air shall carry, etc."</b>: It is explained at the beginning of the chapter [entitled] HaShutafin.
<b>Who will give it to <i>batrai</i> (the last ones or the ones after me), etc. And those who come from them will bring forth to it:</b> According to the explanation of Rashi, it appears to me that this is the explanation: That you should leave them for your children, to the one[s] after you, and they will give it to their sons later. Moreover, the ones who come after you and who will still come after your children will expend, etc. But the matter appears repetitive. And [there should] also [be an explanation for] the change in the language: As he said concerning his children, "it should be for those after you," but he then says it with an expression of giving, "who will give it to the last ones." So it appears that it should be explained that he said to him, "'It should be' - that you should leave them - 'for your children after you, and they will give' bribes 'to those after me.' This is that they will need to provide [money to] the kings of Rome after Antoninus; as we expound (Vayikra Rabbah 16:1), <i>madheva</i> (in Isaiah 13:4, as), <i>maded vehaveh</i> (measaure and bring). He said, "the ones coming after you," because all the time that Rabbi was alive, they did not need to give bribes to the kings of Rome. And it then says that the kings of Rome will come back to take that money. "And those who come from them will bring forth to them" - meaning to the King Mashiach, who will come from your children - that they should expend all of that money to him, as it is found in the midrash; and it is easy to understand.
<b>He would kill one at the entrance of the house of Rabbi and one, etc.:</b> It appears that he had the one who he killed at the entrance of Rabbi's house precede the one he killed at the entrance of his house - according to the context. As when he went from his house, he took two servants, since that is the way of important people - to take two youths with them, as it is written concerning Avraham and concerning Bilaam. And he did not want to kill one in front of his fellow - like he said above, "Kill them one by one, and do not incite all of them." Rather, he placed one to sit at the entrance of his house until he would return and placed the second one at the entrance of Rabbi's house. And it is possible that he said to them that they sit there to guard the entrances. So then it is fine that that he killed the one at the entrance of Rabbi's house upon his return, before he came to kill that one that sat at the entrance of his house. And be precise and you will find it simple.

<b>Mountains and hills, pray, etc.:</b> He was pained that he would die through this repentance. And so he said to them that they should pray for him that he not expire but rather endure in this world, like them. So they answered him that he should not be concerned and worried about his demise in this world. As the entire world is included in the [dimension] of existence and demise: "For the mountains may depart, etc." And it is easy to understand. 
[<b>But they are [even] called, Rabbi:</b> That was the Divine Voice that said, "Rabbi Eliezer, etc." And it is easy to understand.]
