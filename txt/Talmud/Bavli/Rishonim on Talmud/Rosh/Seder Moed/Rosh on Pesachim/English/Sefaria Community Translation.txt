The Sages taught: One may not soak barley in water on Passover. And if one did soak barley grain and it split, it is prohibited. If it did not split, it is permitted. Rabbi Yosei says: he should soak it in vinegar, and the vinegar will cause the grain to contract. However, Shmuel said: The halakha in not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yosei. Rav Ḥisda said that Mar Ukva said: the prohibition does not apply only if it actually split. Rather, this is referring even to a case where if the barley grains were placed on a barrel of wine they would split by themselves. Rabenu Tam learned that it is referring to the top of an Avuv. Shmuel said: This halakha applies only if it actually split. Shmuel took action in accordance with his ruling, when he was in the village of bar Ḥashu’s house. He prohibited only barley grains that had actually split. And since the ruling was not decided, in favour of Mar Ukva or Shmuel, we rule stringently according to Mar Ukva, for this is a Torah doubt. And this is so regarding eating this grain, but if they are found in cooked food, and they are unsplit, since chametz prohibition for very small amounts is rabbinical, we do not forbid the cooked food, because of the two or three grains, unless they are split, like Shmuel, for it is now a rabbinical doubt and we are lenient. And there are those who say that the ruling is according to Shmuel, for Mar Ukva was Shmuel's student, and we don't rule according to the student in the presence of the teacher. And furthermore, we see that Shmuel acted on his ruling, and if it was not so, he would not have acted on it. And it seems to me that for sure, if the grains are found in the dough or in the matzah after it is baked that it is permitted if they did not split. And even if they split, it seems to me that it is permitted, for split grain is not chametz, but close to becoming chametz...

Halakhah 26

There are those who are surprised at Rashi for such leniency that permitsn dough that a gentile kneaded without supervision for we should be concerned that perhaps he kneaded it with leaven and so they explain the Gemara is referring to a case where the gentile kneaded the dough under supervision. This does not seem correct to me for otherwise the text should have been explicit and stated "the dough of gentiles kneaded under supervision." Therefore I prefer to follow Rashi that since we see no yeast or cracks it should be allowed.  

Halakhah 27

There was a certain boat carrying wheat, which capsized before Passover in the Ḥishta River. Rava permitted its owners to sell the recovered grain to gentiles during Passover. Rabba bar Levai raised an objection to the opinion of Rava from a Baraita: With regard to a garment in which diverse kinds, a prohibited mixture of wool and linen, has been lost, i.e., a wool garment into which a linen thread was sewn or vice versa, one may not sell it to a gentile; and one may not even fashion it into a saddlecloth for a donkey. It is prohibited to do so lest one remove a piece of this garment and sew it onto his own clothing. However, one may fashion it into a shroud for a dead body, as there is no concern that he will remove it from the dead. What is the reason that one may not sell it to a gentile? Because of the concern that the gentile will resell it to a Jew.  It should therefore be prohibited to sell this wheat to gentiles, lest they resell it to Jews. Rava reconsidered and then said: He should sell this wheat one kav at a time, i.e., in small measures, each to a different Jew, but not to any one Jew in large quantities, so that all of this wheat will be used before Passover. And Rabenu Ephraim asked: why is the wheat prohibited, it has not split? And he answered, normal soaking of wheat cannot  become chametz unless the wheat grains split. But this wheat even though it is smooth since they lie in water for a long time then can become chametz.

<b>Our rabbis learned, "We say the Great Hallel (Psalm 136, and see below at the bottom of the paragraph for other opinions) over a fifth cup - these are the words of Rabbi Tarfon, and there are those that say, 'The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not lack' (Psalms 23)."</b> And Rashbam [follows] the textual variant, "We say the Great Hallel on the fourth cup," as 'who mentioned the name' of the fifth cup; and if it is coming to say [that the fifth cup is optional and, if wants, he should do a fifth cup, this is how it should have said it: "One who wants to do a fifth cup should say the Great Hallel upon it." But according to the textual variant of the books, it is implied that for Rabbi Tarfon and the 'those that say,' the fifth cup is obligatory, but the world has become accustomed to make it optional. And so did Rabbi Yosef Tov Eelem, may his memory be blessed, write - that if desires to drink, he should make a fifth cup. It is implied from his words that it is [otherwise] forbidden to drink after the four cups. And it is a wonder, as from where do we have this; as later it only says, "We may not eat an <i>afikoman</i> (a dessert or other foods eaten after the meal) after [we are finished eating] the Pesach sacrifice" - which means not to eat, but to drink is permitted. And so also since in the [Talmud] Yerushalmi, it explains that he should not drink between the third and fourth [cups] because of 'lest he get drunk,' it is implied that if we were not concerned about drunkenness, it would be permissible to drink. But the custom that has spread is not to drink wine. And Ram, may his memory be blessed, explained a reason for this custom: that it is because a person is obligated to be involved the whole night with the laws of Pesach and with the exodus from Egypt, to recount the miracles and wonders that the Holy One, blessed be He, did for us, until slumber overcomes him - and if he drinks, he will get drunk [and not be able to do this]. And so too do we say in Tosefta Pesachim 10:11, "A person is obligated to be involved with the laws of Pesach and with the exodus from Egypt the whole night"; and this is what we learned (Pesach Haggadah, Magid, Story of the Five Rabbis 1), "It happened once [on Pesach] that Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua [...] were reclining in Bnei Brak and were telling the story of the exodus from Egypt that whole night, etc." But with the fourth cup, they permitted [drinking], as it has scriptural support, corresponding to the verse (Exodus 6:7), "and I will take you." <b>From where is the Great Hallel? Rav Yehuda said from "Praised" (Psalms 136:1) to "On the rivers of Babylon" (Psalms 137:1). Rabbi Yochanan said from "A song of ascents" to "On the rivers of Babylon." Rab Achaa bar Yaakov says from "Since the Lord has chosen Yaakov" (Psalms 135:4) to "On the rivers of Babylon."</b> But the custom of the world is like Rav Yehuda concerning the Great Hallel.
