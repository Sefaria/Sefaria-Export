Rosh on Sanhedrin



Chapter 1



Chapter 2



Chapter 3



Halakhah 1


They say in the West in the name of Rabbi Zeira, that since this litigant chooses one arbitrator for himself and this litigant chooses one arbitrator for himself and the two chosen arbitrators choose another arbitrator the ruling comes out truthfully. Rashi writes that the true judgment will emerge because each litigant will adhere to the decision, thinking ‘behold I chose one of the arbitrators and if he could have uncovered meritorious arguments in my favor he would have’ and the arbitrators themselves it is natural for them to try to uncover meritorious arguments for each of the litigants since they were chosen by them. 

Halakhah 2

Because there are some lacking in intelligence who misunderstand the words of Rashi and learn from his words that the dayan (arbitrator) must uncover meritorious arguments on behalf of the side who chose him and that he stands in their place to obstruct matters improperly, and some people have become accustomed to choose for themselves (as an arbitrator) a deceitful person and they based this practice on the words of Rashi who implies that the arbitrator should argue on his behalf. Heaven forbid, these people did not read Rashi’s words, for Rashi wrote “thinking ‘behold I chose...’”, as if to say that the litigant believes the arbitrators will uncover meritorious arguments on his behalf more so than on behalf of his adversary and as a result the litigant will abide by the decision. But Heaven forbid that the arbitrator himself should find an argument in his favor unless he finds it to be absolutely compelling. But if he is able to prevail upon his fellow arbitrator to accept his argument even though he is doubtful regarding it, that is in the category of one who distorts justice. Rather, because the litigant chose him he understands the litigant’s perspective clearly and if there is a legitimate argument he will advance it in the deliberations, and the second chosen arbitrator does the same, and as a result no arguments are overlooked, and the third hears the debate among the two arbitrators and decides among them and the judgment emerges truthfully.
