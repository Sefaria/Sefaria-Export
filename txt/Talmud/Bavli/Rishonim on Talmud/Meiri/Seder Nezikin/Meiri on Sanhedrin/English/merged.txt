<b>And these</b> are the ones that do not have a share in the world to come, but are rather punished for their evil for all generations; they will not be able to turn away from [their punishment]: One who denies the revival of the dead, or that he says about it that it is not from the Torah, meaning that it is not from the faith of the prophets. And likewise someone who says the Torah is not from the Heavens, even if he says so only about one verse alone, that Moshe, our teacher, wrote it on his own. And an <i>apikoros</i>, and that is a word that includes many things. And they explained about it that it is one who denigrates a Torah scholar. But behold, [also] included in this are the heretics - and they are those that deny God's existence or His oneness or His simplicity (as opposed to being composite); those who worship idolatry even through an intermediary; and those who deny prophecy or God's omniscience. However since all of these did not fit into this statement and it was not necessary to mention them, they explained about this, that it is the one who they needed to mention, that it is regarding one who denigrates Torah scholars and, all the more so, his teachers. As from denigrating the scholar, one will denigrate his words and his wisdom, and will deny everything that is fitting to believe. So it comes out that even one who denies the explanation of the Torah - and that is the Oral Torah - is included in this. And [also] one who is recalcitrant even about one sin and the denigrates the holidays, or he profanes the sanctified objects. For all of these things indicate an angle of denial, which is not by way of the [evil] impulse or from desire. And likewise one who leads the many to sin, even about light things; and likewise those who separate themselves from the ways of the community, and instead set up their own standards, even though he does not do sins; and likewise one who does sins with a high hand, meaning to anger [God] and publicly and in the way of heresy. And likewise those who put too much fear upon the community for [their own] glory or power, and not for the sake of the Heavens. And likewise one who denies the coming of the Messiah. As all of these cause the destruction of the Torah. And they are all in the category of <i>apikoros</i>, and that is what they said more generally - "'He denigrated the word of God,' that is an <i>apikoros</i>." And [also] one who reveals aspects of Torah, meaning incorrectly; and that is someone who explains the commandments metaphorically in order to uproot the commandment. Rabbi Akiva says, "Also one who reads foreign books," meaning to say, not in order to understand and to teach, but rather with the intention to follow their faith. And you already know about them that they only believe what investigation reveals and what logic proves.
