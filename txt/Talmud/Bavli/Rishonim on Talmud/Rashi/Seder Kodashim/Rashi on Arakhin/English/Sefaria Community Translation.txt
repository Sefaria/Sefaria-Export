1. Mishnah - Everyone takes <i>arakh</i> vows [estimation] - <i>arakh</i> [estimation] that is written in the Chapter [of Arakhin in the Torah]. ([one who says] 'a vow of value [neder] upon me' and calculates like a servant sold in the market).
2. Takes <i>arakh</i> vows - if one says on another, 'the arakh of so-and-so is upon me'. He gives that arakh value of so-and-so according to his years that the arakh values were given according to years [age] as written in the Chapter of Arakhin. And after the years of the subject of the arakh vow we follow.

Line 12

<b>Our Mishnah - a field, a lot:</b> A lot was a thousand cubits around the city. At it is written (Numbers 35:4), "from the walls of the city and outward a thousand cubits." And outside of those thousand [cubits], the Levites had a thousand cubits for [cultivated] fields and vineyards. As it is written (Numbers 35:5), "You shall measure from outside the city [two thousand], etc." Subtract a thousand cubit lot from them, and the rest is fields and vineyards. A lot is emptied of anything; it has no house in it, nor do we plant in it. Rather it is an adornment for the city [that way].
<b>One may not render a field a lot:</b> Because of [the commandment of] settling the land of Israel; and it [would be its] destruction to reduce [its] planted area.
<b>Nor a lot a field:</b> As he [would] destroy the adornment of the city. 
<b>One may not make a lot into a city:</b> That he should make building in it, as a city is not becoming without a lot. And all the more so does one not make a city  into a lot, since we do not destroy the settlement of a city.
