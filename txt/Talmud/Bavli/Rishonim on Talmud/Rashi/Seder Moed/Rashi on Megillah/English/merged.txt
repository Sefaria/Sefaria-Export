Rashi on Megillah



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

The Megillah is read on the 11th etc... -  Sometimes on this and sometimes on this, and further it will be explained 
Not less and not more - Not before the 11th and not later than the 15th.  
From the days of Yehoshua - In the Gemara it will be explained
But villages move forward to the day of entry - Which is to say, since the walled cities read on the 15th, and since the walled cities do not read on the 14th, behold in all, where is it found (that we read on) the 11th, the 12th, the 13th?  But the Sages gave to villages permission to push forward their reading to the day of entry.  The second day from Shabbat (Monday) which would fall before the 14th, or the fifth day from Shabbat (Thursday), which is a day of entry for the villages, whom enter into the cities for judgment (court cases) before the Beit Dinim (Courts) which dwell in the cities on Mondays and Thursday, as was decreed by Ezra (see Bava Kama page 82).  And the villages are not experts in reading, and need one of the men of the city to read for them, and the Sages didn't burden them to make them come later, so they come on the day of the 14th and sometimes on the day of entry on the 13th and sometimes it is the 11th.  

Line 2



Line 3

Should the 14th fall on Erev Shabbat (Friday), large cities and walled cities will read on that day (Friday) - For there is no Megilah reading on Shabbat due to a Gezeira (Rabbinical legislation to prevent the violation of a biblical commandment) for perhaps one may come to carry it (the Megilah) in his hand (and thereby violate the Sabbath).  If you should say that walled cities should delay until Sunday, that would be the 16th and the Megilah states that the time for reading the Megilah should not go past the 15th.

Line 4

Should (the 14th of Adar) begin on Sunday, villages will move their reading up to the previous Day of Assembly (Thursday) - This will be the 11th (of Adar) and we don't find a Day of Assembly that is before Purim that is earlier than that because we do not advance the Megilah reading from one Day of Assembly to the previous Day of Assembly.

Line 5

Gemara: This is the correct version of the text: From where is it derived? (What kind of questions is) From where!? It's like we mean to say later etc. - And here is the meaning: From where is it derived that the 11th, 12th, and 13th are appropriate days for reading (the Megilah)? For (only) the 14th and 15th are written in the Bible (Megilat Esther). The Gemara retorts by asking "From where is it derived?" with astonishment.  This is not obligatory rather the Sages provided a leniency as we shall see later on.
In order that they may provide - So that they will be available on Purim to provide for the needs regarding the Purim feast to the residents of the large cities. 

Line 6

This is what we mean to ask - We who are asking "From where is it derived (that the Megila may read on 11th, 12th, or 13th under certain circumstances)? This is what we mean:
Let's analyze the situation - since the Sages provided a leniency to the villagers to read early, of necessity you must therefore conclude that the Men of the Great Assembly who established the festivities of Purim and the reading of the Megila in the days of Mordechai and Esther must have established all of these days (11th, 12th, and 13th along with the explicitly stated 14th and 15h) and given permission to read (the Megila on those days).
Because if you should think - the 14th and 15th are established in writing in the Megila and no more (i.e. no other dates).
How could the Rabbis come - How could (the Rabbis) that came after them (the Men of the Great Assembly) and uproot their enactment and give permission for (villagers) to read earlier (than the 14th)! (read with with astonishment):

Line 12

...A time of assembly - Everyone assembled to avenge from their enemies, whether in Shushan or other places as it is written in the book, therefore, the passuk does not need to include the 13th day as a day for reading the Megilla because the essence of the miracle happened on that day.

Will blow in them - In a regular breath they will fall.  

Line 6

He whose heart knocks - The one who fears from sins that are in his hand say like that.  

Line 7

Do not T'tchhar (compete) - This is not the langue of provoking, rather that you should grab (emulate) his deeds, like the word (T'tchar)'s usage in "Do not grab onto the horses" (Jeremiah, 12:5).  Which is to say, that you shouldn't run amongst them.

<b>Brother of the head:</b> Meaning, similar to him.

<b>He sought to destroy</b> the foundation that Zerubavel had established for the Temple in the days of Cyrus, before Ahasuerus - like it is stated in the book of Ezra (4).
<b>An accusation:</b> One who was appointed to accuse them, so that they not build it.

<b>Ach:</b> Oy.

<b>For he had dominion:</b> This is written about Solomon.
<b>Just as he reigned over Tiphsah and over Gaza, etc.:</b> And this is what it is saying - that he had dominion on all of this side of the river, like [he had] from Tiphsah to Gaza.

Line 22



Line 23

<b>Ruled over the dome:</b> Under all of the dome of the sky.

<b>He did not complete his kingship:</b> He did not finish his kingship. As behold he was driven away, as we say in Tractate Gittin (Gittin 68b).

Line 2

<b>This works out well according to the one who said, etc.:</b> In Tractate Gittin, in the chapter [entitled] Mi SheAchzo:
<b>Over the heavenly ones:</b> Over the demons.

Line 5



Line 6

 <b>When the king sat:</b> It is implied [that] it was at the beginning of his reign. But then it goes back to write, "In the third year."
<b>When his mind was settled:</b> As at the beginning, he worried that Israel would leave from being under his hand when the seventy years of the Babylonian exile were finished. But now [his mind] was settled.

Line 7

<b>What is it:</b> The calculation of Balshazzar and his mistake. 
<b>After the completion for Babylonia:</b> As he reasoned - for the kingdom of Babylonia - from the day that Babylonia assumed [its] reign. And that is [when] Nebuchadnezzar took the reign from Esarhaddon, the king of Assyria
<b>He calculated:</b> [Meaning,] Balshazzar: Forty-five of Nebuchadnezzar and twenty-three of Evil-merodach. 
<b>And two of his:</b> As we find that Balshazzar reigned three years. As it is written in the book of Daniel (8:1), "In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar, a vision appeared to me, to me, Daniel, etc."

Line 8

<b>They were exiled in the seventh; they were exiled in the eighth:</b> It is one exile; and the verses are to be expounded: It is written, "in the eighth year of (the reign of Nebuchadnezzar)," about the exile of Yehoyachin at the end of the book of Kings (II Kings 24:12). Yet in the book of Jeremiah - at its end (Jeremiah 52:28) - [it is written], "whom [Nebuchadnezzar] exiled in the seventh year." Rather it was eight years for [the establishment of]  the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar, and seven for the conquest of  Yehoyakim. As he conquered him [to be] beneath him in the second year of his reign. And he did not exile him, but he became his servant three years. And "eighteen" and "nineteen," were written about the exile of Tzidkiyahu at the end of the book of Jeremiah. And this is the destruction of Jerusalem, which was eleven years after the exile of Yehoyachin - as it is written (Jeremiah 52:5), "[until] the eleventh year of King Tzidkiyahu, etc." And what were the eighteen and nineteen? Eighteen from the conquest of Yehoyakim, and nineteen from the [establishment of] the kingdom of Nebuchadnezzar.

Line 9

<b>As the Master said, "The first year, he conquered Nineveh":</b> As it was the capital of the kingdom of Assyria, for the king was in Nineveh.
<b>In his second, he conquered Yehoyakim:</b> The verses are expounded in Seder Olam: It is written at the beginning of the book of Daniel (1:1-2), "In the third year of the reign of Yehoyakim [...], Nebuchadnezzar [...] came to Jerusalem [...]. And the Lord delivered King Yehoyakim into his hand." Is it possible to say this? And is it not that he did not reign until the fourth year of Yehoyakim? As it is stated in the book of Jeremiah (45) [that] the thing that happened in the fourth year of Yehoyakim, was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar! Rather what do we learn to say -  "In the third year of the reign of Yehoyakim?" It was in the third year of his rebellion. After he conquered him, he served him three years and [then] rebelled against him. As it is stated (II Kings 24:1), "and [Yehoyakim]  became his servant for three years, and then he turned and rebelled against him." And it teaches you here that he held up in his rebellion three years. Behold, it is six years from his being conquered; and this time he was given into his hand and he killed him, such that, "He shall have the burial of a donkey" (Jeremiah 22:19) was fulfilled. And Nebuchadnezzar crowned Yehoyachin, his son, in his place and came [back] to Babylonia. His advisers said to him, "The father rebelled against you, and you crowned his son? They say a parable - a good puppy does not come from a bad dog." So he recanted at the end of the year and exiled him; and crowned Tzidkiyahu. (Vayikra Rabbah 19, Metzora) And likewise is it written in the book of Kings at its end. It comes out that the exile of Yehoyachin was in the seventh year of the conquering of Yehoyakim. Yet behold the verse calls it the eighth year! It was the eighth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. [As] at the end of the book of Kings we learned that he conquered him in the second year of his reign.
<b>Evil-merodach, king of Babylonia, lifted up, etc.:</b> We learned that Evil-merodach [began to] reign in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Yehoyachin; and Nebuchadnezzar had already reigned eight years before the exile of Yehoyachin. Eight and thirty-seven is forty-five; and the twenty-three of Evil-merodach; and the two of Belshazzar. 

Line 10

<b>I will take out the vessels of the Holy Temple:</b> In the third year of his reign. 

Line 11



Line 12

<b>He said:</b> Ahasuerus [said], "He certainly erred."
<b>I will calculate, etc. the exile of Babylonia:</b> The beginning of the exile in which Yechoniyah was exiled. 
<b>How many are lacking</b> of the seventy, from the second year of Belshazzar? Eight - those eight years that Nebuchadnezzar reigned before he exiled Yechoniyah. As Belshazzar should not have counted them, but he did count them.
<b>He calculated:</b> Ahasuerus [calculated] from the second [year] of Belshazzar, until his [own] third.
<b>And inserted</b> those eight in their place.
<b>One of Belshazzar:</b> For behold, the seventy years were finished from the second year, according to his count. So he went back and counted the third.
<b>And five of Darius the Mede and Cyrus the Persian:</b> As it is written (Daniel 6:1), "And Darius the Mede received the kingdom." And after him, Cyrus the First reigned. For he gave permission to the exiles to ascend [back to Israel], as it is stated (Ezra 1:2), "Thus said Cyrus, etc." And it would come up in your mind now that, between the two of them, they had reigned for five years - even though it is not written in Scripture.
<b>And two of Ahasuerus:</b> Two of his years had already passed.

Line 13

<b>From the destruction of Jerusalem:</b> The exile of Tzidkiyahu, when the city was burnt down. And it is explicitly written in it that one needs to count from the destruction of Jerusalem. As it is written (Daniel 9:2), "at the completion of seventy years for the destruction of Jerusalem."

Line 14

<b>Eleven:</b> For the Temple stood that much after the exile of Yechoniyah.
 <b>How many years did he reign? Fourteen:</b> As it is written (Esther 3:7), "in the twelfth year [...], a <i>pur</i> - that is, a lottery - was cast." And in the next year, the miracle was done. Behold that is thirteen, since the kings of the nations of the world count [the years] from Tishrei, so the new year began in Tishrei (in the middle of the lottery). And it is written in the next year (Esther 9:29), "to confirm this second letter of Purim." Behold that is fourteen. 
<b>Then</b> - in the days of Cyrus - the work of the House of God ceased. As Cyrus had commanded to build [it] and then recanted about it because of enemies of Yehudah and Benyamin, as it is written in the book of Ezra. Until the second year of Darius the Second, who reigned after Ahasuerus. And he was called by three names: Darius, Cyrus and Artaxerxes.
<b>The years were partial:</b> There are some of those years that we counted above, the beginning of which were absorbed in the previous year. For example, we counted five years for Darius the Mede and Cyrus - you will only find four. As it is written about the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus in the book of Daniel (10:1), "In the third year of the reign of Cyrus, etc." And we learned in Seder Olam: We only exclusively found one year for [the reign] of Media in the [holy] writings. And we found three years for Cyrus in the book of Daniel (10:1), "In the third year of the reign of Cyrus, etc." And we also learned in Seder Olam: Cyrus reigned for three partial years. Behold you counted an extra year (five instead of four). And also, since a year was absorbed in the years of Nebuchadnezzar and Evil-merodach. So corresponding to this, the building waited two years [at the time of the second] Darius.  

Daf 12a



Line 1

<b>It is also taught like this:</b> [It, being] that a year was absorbed in the years of Nebuchadnezzar and Evil-merodach.
<b>There was still another year left for Babylonia:</b> Thus is it found in Seder Olam: "In that night Belshazzar, the king [...], was slain. And Darius the Mede received the kingdom" (Daniel 5:30 - 6:1). Behold that is seventy years from the day that Nebuchadnezzar reigned; sixty-nine from the day that he conquered Yehoyakim; and still one more year 'for Babylonia,' for the completion of the seventy years from when he ruled over Israel - and Darius rose and completed it. And after him, in the next year, Cyrus reigned in Babylonia and they were partially remembered. As he said, "Anyone of you of all His people—may his God be with him, and let him go up, etc." (Ezra 1:2). We learned from this baraita that when Belshazzar died, there were only sixty-nine years from the conquest of Yehoyakim. But above we counted seventy years: Forty-five of Nebuchadnezzar, twenty-three of Evil-merodach and three of Belshazzar. Hence [some of them] were partial years.

Line 2

<b>I meditated in the books:</b> This is an expression of counting and calculating. 

Line 3

<b>It is written, "after the completion for Babylonia</b> of seventy years, I will remember you." This is a verse in the book of Jeremiah (29:10).
<b>And it is written</b> in the book of Daniel (9:2), "seventy years for the destruction of Jerusalem" - the same number of years which was the word of God to the prophet Jeremiah.

Line 4

<b>Only for being remembered:</b> And he said, "after the completion for Babylonia will I remember you." And so it was. For they were remembered in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, which was the seventy-first year from the conquering of Yehoyakim, when Babylonia had invaded Israel. 

Line 5

<b>Messiach:</b> The anointed one, as in anointing (<i>hamischah</i>) oil. 
<b>I am complaining to you:</b> And this is what it means: This is what the Lord said to his anointed one, "[I said] to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, etc. [that] he would build my Temple." They are two sentences that are adjacent to each other. And the cantillation marks of this verse prove this homily. For there is no <i>zarka</i> in Scripture that is not followed by a <i>segol</i>. But here we vocalize, "to his anointed one," with a <i>zarka</i>; yet we vocalize, "to Cyrus," with a <i>maarich</i> - to separate it and remove it from, "to his anointed one."
<b>Anyone of you of all His people, etc.:</b> But he himself did not make efforts for this thing.

Line 6

<b>It is written, "Persia and Media, the nobles":</b> It placed, "the nobles," adjacent to Media. But it is written, "of the kings of Media and Persia" - it placed, "the kings," adjacent to Media.

Line 7

<b>The priestly vestments:</b> Since he had in his hand there, the vestments of the high priest that they brought from Jerusalem.

Line 8

<b>He was clever:</b> As he had the feast for those who were distant precede the feast for the people of his city.

Line 9

<b>They prostrated before the idol</b> in the days of Nebuchadnezzar.

Line 10

<b>Is there favoritism in this thing:</b> How did they merit a miracle?
<b>They did [it] for appearance:</b> From fear.

Line 11



Line 12

<b>Many holes:</b> Needlework. The craft of [making] bed sheets was done with many holes.
<b>White wool:</b> <i>Chur</i> is an expression of <i>chiver</i> (white in Aramaic).

Line 13

 <b>One who was fit for silver:</b> It expounded, "the couches were of gold and of silver" - a minister that was fit for gold [got] gold, and an inferior one [got] silver.

Line 14

<b>That ingratiate themselves with their owners:</b> He made a floor for them with searched stones, meaning that they only come to a person with effort, such that their owners search and seek for them, until they find them for a precious [amount] of money.
<b>And similarly, it states</b> that Scripture praises precious stones and states that they come from many trials, "as the stones of a crown, glittering over His land." And the verse is speaking about Israel, in the future to come - that they will be important and precious among the nations like the glittering stones of a crown.

Line 15

<b>Many rows:</b> Many rows surrounding [it]; and <i>socheret</i> is an expression [similar to], <i>sechor sechor</i> (round and round).
<b>Like midday:</b> So this, <i>socheret</i>, is an expression of <i>sahara</i> (light). 
<b>He proclaimed a remission for all the merchants:</b> He gave relief to the people of his kingdom by removing the tax of merchants.

Line 16

<b>The early ones:</b> Meaning, Belshazzar and his group.

Line 17

<b>Just as the law of the Torah:</b> The food of the altar is greater than the drink - a bull and three <i>isaron</i> of fine flour for food; but the libation is [only] half a <i>hin</i>.

Line 18

<b>From wine of his country:</b> Wine that he is used to, such that he will not get drunk [and he will not drink it] except according to his will.
<b>According to the wish of Mordekhai and Haman:</b> They were the chief cupbearers at the party.

Line 19

<b>He with pumpkins:</b> Large squash.

Daf 12b



Line 1

<b>With zucchinis:</b> Small squash. Meaning to say, with the same exact variety, he commits adultery and she commits adultery. He wants to show her beauty and she intended that [as well] - that they gaze at her beauty. 

Line 2



Line 3



Line 4



Line 5

<b>She was <i>peritzta</i>:</b> She was immodest.
<b>This teaches that she broke out in leprosy:</b> And it is learned by <i>gezerah shavah</i> (ירושלמי is a misreading of ג"ש): "and what had been decreed (<i>nigzar</i>) against her" (Esther 2:1); and it is written (II Chronicles 26:21), "He lived in isolated quarters as a leper, for he was cut off (<i>nigzar</i>) from the House of the Lord." Just like there it is leprosy, so too here is it leprosy.

Line 6

<b><i>Ahuraiarei</i>:</b> Horse guardians.
<b>Drank wine against a thousand:</b> So did Scripture testify about him (Daniel 5:1). 

Line 7

<b>It will cease from him:</b> His wine will abate a little from him.
<b>On its lees:</b> On its sediment.


Line 8

<b>And they told him a reason:</b> And they spoke well to him, as it is certainly so. For from a man's being still, his mind is settled. As it is stated (Jeremiah 48:11), "Moav has been at ease from his youth; upon his sediment is he still." And [the verse's] end is, "therefore his fine flavor has remained and his bouquet is unspoiled."

Line 9

<b>This entire verse is stated on account of offerings:</b> "And next (<i>karov</i>) to him," is an expression of offering a sacrifice (<i>hakravat korban</i>). The ministering angels mentioned before the Holy One, blessed be He, the offerings that Israel brought before him, [so as] to take vengeance upon Vashti for them and [that] Esther should come and rule in her stead.

Line 10

<b>Carshena:</b> Did they ever offer before You lambs (<i>karim</i>) of the first year (<i>shana</i>)?
<b>Shethar:</b> Two turtledoves (<i>shetei torim</i>).
<b>Meres:</b> As they stirred (<i>meirsu</i>) the blood, such that it not coagulate and then not be fit for sprinkling. 
<b>Marsena:</b> They stirred (<i>meirsu</i>) the meal-offerings to mix them. <i>Memares</i> is an expression of stirring.

Line 11

<b>Prepared (<i>mukhan</i>) for calamity:</b> He stood to be hung.
<b>From here [we see] that the common man jumps to the front:</b> For behold, Scripture enumerated him at the end [of the list]. Hence he was inferior to all of [the others], yet he jumped to the front.

Line 12

<b>Were it not for the first letters:</b> For through them, he was presumed in the eyes of the nations to be a fool.
<b>There would not have been left among the enemies of the Jewish people a remnant or a refugee:</b> As they would have hurried to kill them at the command of the king, in the middle letters, and they would have not waited for the appointed day. 

Line 13

<b>They say, "What is this that he has sent us":</b> The nations say, "What is this that he sent to us - saying to us, 'that every man shall wield authority in his house?' As even a weaver wield authority in his house!"
<b><i>Paredashekha</i>:</b> An officer and a governor.

Line 14



Line 15

<b>Maiden:</b> David only sought one maiden. [So] every man showed his daughter to his messengers - perhaps she would be good in his eyes. Whereas Ahasuerus was foolish - he commanded to gather all of them. Everyone knew that he would only take (marry) one, but he would have intercourse with all of them. [So] whoever had a daughter hid her.

Line 16



Line 17



Line 18

<b>He was crowned with names:</b> With pleasant names. <i>Nimos</i> is name in the Greek language.

Line 19

<b>We do not teach the version, ("The youths of"):</b> Rather we teach this: Rabba bar bar Chana said that Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, etc.
<b>Because David did not kill Shimei:</b> As he was liable for the death penalty.

Line 20

<b>From the opposite perspective:</b> As a cry and not as praise: The man of Judah and the man of Benyamin caused me this distress.

Daf 13a



Line 1



Line 2

<b>There are certain Judean men:</b> And the end of the verse (Daniel 3:12) is, "they serve not your gods."

Line 3

<b>All of your words are one:</b> He was saying towards the book, "'All of your words,' Chronicles, 'are one.' You mention many names, x and y; but they are all one person...
<b>And we know how to expound them:</b> And even though you hid them, we put our [minds to it], until we know how to expound them." This is mentioned here, because we said earlier, "anyone who repudiates idolatry is called a Judean."
<b>And his wife, the Judean, etc.:</b> And was her name not Bityah? As behold, it is written at [the verse's] end (I Chronicles 4:18), "and these were the sons of Bityah."

Line 4

<b>To wash:</b> To immerse; (an expression of) conversion.

Line 5



Line 6



Line 7



Line 8

<b>Was his name not Kalev:</b> Since the verse is speaking about Kalev.
<b>We teach (follow) this version - and marry the daughter of Pharaoh, who rebelled against the idols of her father’s home:</b> And that is why she changed her name with this marriage.

Line 9

<b>That he went into exile on his own:</b> Since it was not written, "Who had been from the group that was carried into exile," but [rather] written, "Who had been exiled with the group that was carried into exile" - it is implied that he was not like the rest of Israel, who were exiled against their will. But he went into exile on his own, like Yirmiyah did. For [the latter] went into exile on his own, until the Holy One, blessed be He, told him to return. 

Line 10

<b>Standing among the myrtles in the deep:</b> Among the righteous that were exiled to Babylonia. And the verse (Zechariah 1:8) is speaking about the Divine Presence. 

Line 11



Line 12

<b>Istahar:</b> Moon. She was beautiful like the moon.
<b>She was greenish:</b> Like that myrtle.
<b>But a cord of kindness was strung about her</b> from the Holy One, blessed be He. That is why she appeared beautiful to the nations and to Ahasuerus.

Line 13

<b>Why do I need, "when her father and mother were dead,"</b> since it is already written, "For she had neither father nor mother." Rather it is to teach that she did not have a father or a mother even one day.
<b>At the time that her mother became pregnant, her father died:</b> It comes out that she did not have a father at the time it is apt to be called father.
<b>And when she gave birth to her, her mother died:</b> So she was not apt to be called mother.

Line 14

<b>But the poor man had nothing:</b> The verse is speaking about Uriah.
<b>One ewe lamb:</b> Batsheva.

Line 15

<b>That she would count the days of the week by them:</b> That one would serve her on the first [day] of the week, one would serve her on the second of the week and one on the third of the week. And likewise, all of them. So when the day of the maidservant of Shabbat arrived, she knew it was Shabbat.

Line 16

<b>Pig hinds:</b> Fatty <i>bacons</i>. And because of her [being] compelled, she was not punished. 

Line 17

<b>So the steward took away their food and the wine that they should drink, etc.:</b> And it is written about that matter (Daniel 1:15), "When the ten days were over, they looked better and healthier, etc."

Line 18

<b><i>Anpakinon</i> is the oil of olives that have not reached one-third [of their growth]:</b> It is taught concerning meal-offerings, "We do not bring <i>anpakinon</i>; and if one brought [it], it is disqualified." And Rabbi Yehudah was speaking about this, and said what <i>anpakinon</i> is.
<b>Softens:</b> Brightens.

Line 19

 <b>From the disgrace of that wicked man:</b> His disgrace is that he would have intercourse with women and send them away.

Line 20

<b>Which the body takes pleasure from a body</b> because of the cold. And Scripture is testifying that they intended it from the Heavens, to make her beloved to her husband.

Line 21

<b>[If] he wanted to taste, etc.:</b> That it is why it stated, "than all the women," and "than all the virgins."

Line 22

<b>He made a party, etc.:</b> It refers back to several matters - to appease her, such that she reveal her heritage. But it did not help. And adjacent to this verse (Esther 2:19-20), "And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, etc. Esther did not reveal her heritage or her people, etc." - is that he made a banquet party in her honor, which he did not do for the other wives.
<b>He lowered the taxes:</b> He said, "On account of Esther, I am foregoing the head taxes from you." That is, "he instituted a reprieve" (Esther 2:18).
<b>He sent <i>pardishenei</i>:</b> Gifts to the ministers in her name. And that is that which is written, "and gave gratuities as befits a king." 

Line 23



Line 24



Daf 13b



Line 1

<b>He withdraws not His eyes from the righteous:</b> He places His eyes upon the act of the righteous, to pay them back, measure for measure, even in much time.
<b>She merited that Shaul should descend from her:</b> As he was modest.
<b>He merited that Esther should descend from him:</b> Mordechai' ancestry is established in the Targum to the Scroll [of Esther], and it makes him the tenth [generation] from Shaul, and [then further back] from Shaul to Binyamin. And it is written (Esther 2:7), "that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter." But he has no other proof from the verses that she descended from Shaul.

Line 2



Line 3



Line 4



Line 5

<b>She gave them</b> to Leah. And that is modesty, that she did not publicize that she gave her the distinguishing signs.

Line 6

<b>As it is stated, "He withdraws not His eyes from the righteous:</b> And the end of the verse (Job 36:7) is, "He establishes them forever, and they are exalted" - and that is greatness for [all] the generations.
<b>But if he becomes arrogant, etc.:</b> Hence the verses are adjacent - "He establishes them forever, and they are exalted"; and "And if they are bound in chains" (Job 36:8): Because they raise themselves, they come to poverty and afflictions.

Line 7

<b>And immerse</b> due to cleanliness, such that she should not be disgusting to the righteous one from the semen of Ahasuerus.

Line 8

<b>A master with his servants:</b> "And Pharaoh was enraged at his two officials" (Genesis 40:2). 

Line 9



Line 10

<b>The language of Tarsi:</b> It is the name of a place.
<b>We have not slept:</b> Since she was beloved to him, he would engage in much intercourse, and get thirsty to [want to] drink.

Line 11

<b>My post and your post:</b> Your are appointed over one job and I am appointed over a different job. 

Line 12

<b>We (follow) teach this version - After these things, King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, etc.:</b> This is written after [the story of] Bigtan and Teresh.
<b>And the [Talmud] asks, "After what":</b> What is Scripture testifying to, such that he promoted [Haman] only after this story occurred.
<b>After the Holy One, Blessed be He, created a remedy for the blow,</b> which would come in the future, after a time. 

Line 13

<b>"When I would have healed Israel":</b> And afterwards, "the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered," through the blow that I will bring upon them.

Line 14



Line 15

<b>"They cast a <i>pur</i>":</b> And what is a <i>pur</i>? "It is a lottery [...] concerning each day" - on which day the lottery will land. And likewise, "concerning each month." And he cast the lottery for all of them on one day; and the lottery landed on one day. 
<b>Moshe died on the seventh of Adar:</b> As it is stated (Joshua 4:19), "And the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month (Nissan)." Remove from them thirty days backwards for the mourning for Moshe; and three days that they prepared provisions for themselves. As it is stated (Joshua 1:11), "Prepare provisions for yourselves, for in another three days you are to cross, etc." Hence Moshe died on the seventh of Adar.
<b>And he was born on the seventh of Adar:</b> As it is written (Deuteronomy 31:2), "A hundred and twenty years old am I today" - today completed my days and my years. The birth is worthy to atone for the death.

Line 16



Line 17

<b>There are rabbis among them:</b> From Haman's answer, we learn that Ahasuerus answered him thus.

Line 18

<b>I am making a bald spot in your kingdom:</b> Since one country is full of them.
<b>A province</b> A small state.

Line 19

<b>Nor do they marry from our</b> women.
<b>Nor do they keep the king’s laws:</b> They do not remit the labor tax, duties, head taxes and crop taxes.
<b>They spend the entire year with <i>Shehi Pehi</i>:</b> [An abbreviation for:] It is Shabbat today; it is Pesach today, and we are forbidden to work.
 <b>It does not profit:</b> It is not fit; so there is no concern [that would warrant] leaving them.

Line 20



Line 21

<b>We makes an announcement:</b> The court [announces] that they should bring their shekel-coins to the Temple.
<b>And about diverse kinds:</b> As the seeds have grown a little and the bud is recognizable. So they uproot them from their fields with the announcement of the court. 

Line 22



Daf 14a



Line 1

<b>The parable of Ahasuerus and Haman, etc.:</b> Meaning to say [that] it can be learned from Ahasuerus, that it was also his intention to destroy them. 

Line 2



Line 3

<b>(To return them) to the right way:</b> As they decreed fasts upon them, for repentance - as it is written (Esther 4:3), "fasting, weeping, and wailing, and everybody lay in sackcloth and ashes."

Line 4

<b>Except for the reading of the Megillah (Scroll of Esther):</b> But perhaps you will say, [also] the light of Channukah! [However,] the prophets had already ceased. Whereas in the days of Mordechai, there was Chaggai, Zechariah and Malakhi (they were still alive).

Line 5

<b>From slavery to freedom:</b> With the exodus from Egypt, they recited the song at the sea.

Line 6

<b>Let us also recite Hallel:</b> As it is song.

Line 8

<b>We teach this version - Rava said, "Granted there, etc. and not servants of Pharaoh":</b> For behold, they went out to freedom.
<b>We were still the servants of Ahasuerus:</b> As they were only saved from death.

Line 9

<b>Both according to Rava</b> who said this is why we do not say Hallel, as we were still the servants of Ahasuerus - then if not for that, we would say it -
<b>As well as according to Rav Naḥman</b> who said [that] the reading of the Scroll is in place of Hallel.
<b>All the other lands were [not] fit for song</b> over the miracle that occurred to them.

<b>Rav said:</b> This is what he yelled.
<b>Haman has risen above Ahasuerus:</b> For he had the temerity to say what Ahasuerus did not have the temerity [to say].
<b>The upper King has prevailed:</b> It is a replacement term for the opposite, by way of euphemistic language.

Line 10

<b>Was exceedingly distressed (<i>vatitchalchal</i>):</b> The hollow (<i>chalal</i>) of her body melted.

Line 11

<b>Because he was cut down from his greatness</b> in the days of Ahasuerus. As behold, Belshazzar had made three govern over his kingdom (one of whom was Daniel). And likewise Darius the Mede, as it is stated (Daniel 6:3), "And over them were three ministers, of which Daniel was one." And likewise Cyrus, as it is stated (Daniel 6:29), "And Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and during the reign of Cyrus the Persian." But when Ahasuerus governed, he cut him down from his greatness.

Line 12



Line 13

<b>But he:</b> Daniel did not go to respond to his mission.
<b>For a sad report:</b> As Esther was prevented from coming to the king. Hence Chatach did not respond to his mission. But Esther sent her words through others.

Line 14

<b>Until now</b> I had intercourse under compulsion.
<b>But now:</b> From here onwards, it is with my [own] will.
<b>I shall be lost from you:</b> I will be forbidden to you. For the wife of a Jew who is raped is permitted to her husband; but if [she engaged in intercourse] willingly, she is forbidden to her husband.

Line 15

<b>The first festive day of Pesach:</b> As behold, the letters were written on the thirteenth of Nissan, and the decree was proclaimed in Shushan. So on the fourteenth, the fifteenth and the sixteenth, they fasted; and Haman was hung on the sixteenth. 
<b>That he crossed over a stream of water</b> to gather the Jews on the other side.

Daf 15b

Line 10

<b>The arm of Pharaoh’s daughter:</b> "And she sent her arm (or miadservat) and she fetched it" (Exodus 2:5).
<b>With the teeth of the wicked:</b> [Referring to] Og, King of Bashan - in Tractate Berakhot [in] the chapter [entitled] HaRoeh (Berakhot 54b) - who uprooted a mountain three parasangs long, to throw it upon Israel, and brought it on his head. So The Holy One, Blessed be He, brought ants upon it and they pierced it and it fell on his neck. He wanted to remove it, but his teeth were extended this way and that way.
<b>Do not read, "You have broken (<i>shibarta</i>)," but as, "You have extended (<i>sheribavta</i>)":</b> We teach (follow) this version. And this teaching is derived from, "the teeth of the wicked (<i>shinei reshayim</i>)." For let the verse write, "and the tooth of the wicked one (<i>shen rasha:</i>)! Rather [it is to add the extra] <i>yod</i> of <i>shinei</i> and the [extra] <i>yod mem</i> of <i>reshayim</i> - behold [the total numerical count of these three letters is] sixty.

Line 11

<b>And not something that would divide the kingdom:</b> The building of the Temple. Since it is in the middle of the world, as we say in the Order of Yoma (54b), "The foundation stone (upon which the Temple was built) - the one from which the world was founded."

Line 12



Line 13

<b>She learned from her father’s house:</b> She heard the youths (young students) saying this.
<b>And he rebel</b> against the king, as it was a fortuitous time for it.

Line 14

<b>So that he be on hand for her:</b> Perhaps she could make him stumble in something before the king.
<b>The Holy One, blessed be He, will take notice</b> that even I am bringing the enemies of Israel close. Or also (another explantion): He will take notice that I must ingratiate myself with this wicked one and cheapen my honor.

Line 15

<b>So that both he and she would be killed:</b> That the king should suspect me [of consorting with Haman] and he kill both of us. [A different version: And if they issued a decree and one of them died, the decree becomes nullified.] <b>He was a fickle king</b> and he would change his word. She said, "Maybe I can seduce [the king] and kill [Haman]. But if he is not on hand, the time will pass and he will reverse himself."

Line 16

<b>When they are heated, I will make feasts for them:</b> It is stated about Belshazzar and his group. When they returned from war - such that Darius and Cyrus were besieging Babylon, and Belshazzar was victorious over them - and they were tired and heated, they sat to drink and became drunk. And it was on that day that he was killed. And Esther also said, "From the party of the evil ones, their punishment comes to them."

Line 17



Line 18

<b>Those that were full, have hired themselves out for bread:</b> Yonatan translated [this verse, in his Targum, to be] about the sons of Haman.

Line 20

<b>The sleep of the King of the universe:</b> Similar to, "And the Lord awoke as one out of sleep" (Psalms 78:65) - to take His vengeance.
<b>The higher ones were disturbed:</b> As the angels were disturbing him the whole night; and they said, "Ingrate, reward the good of the one who did it!" [These are the words] of my teacher. But some say the higher ones were disturbed so that they would multiply their supplications to plead for the matter.

Line 21

<b>What is this before us that she has invited:</b> Meaning, what's this new type of thing being brought before me now?

Line 22

<b>Written:</b> This implies that it was [being] written anew, whereas, "a writing," implies [that it was] already written. [Hence,] "And the book of record was found being written before him, that Mordecai had told." 

Daf 16a



Line 1

<b>Shimshai:</b> The king's scribe was an anti-Semite; and he was [the royal scribe] from the times of Cyrus. As it is stated in the book of Ezra (4) that he wrote an accusation against building the Temple, until Cyrus came and annulled it. And he also did this in the days of Ahasuerus, as it is stated (Ezra 4:6), "And in the reign of Ahasuerus, at the start of his reign, (he) wrote an accusation."

Line 12

<b>And to his fasting:</b> The third day of his fasting, as they began to fast on the fourteenth of Nissan. And that which Scripture stated about the previous day (Esther 5:1) - "On the third day, Esther put on royal apparel" - that was the third day from the sending of the runners.

Line 13



Line 14

<b>If he is of the seed of the Jews:</b> There is some seed (offspring) among the  Jews, such that if he comes from them, you cannot prevail over him.

<b>He would fain flee out of its hand:</b> The people of his group and his friends flee from his hand.

<b>One for Esther:</b> As Ahasuerus was angry about what Haman did to Esther.

Line 24

<b>The thing from which that righteous man Joseph had suffered:</b> Yosef was sold as a slave on account of the jealousy of his brothers.

Daf 16b



Line 1

<b>He should stumble</b> is the version we teach (follow). And we do not teach the version - "His seed."

Line 2

<b>How many necks did Binyamin have:</b> We do not follow [teach] this version. For this is the way of Scripture, to write, "necks," in the plural form, [as in] (Genesis 27:17), "upon the flat of his necks." [So here too] - "he cried upon his necks." 

Line 3



Line 4

<b>He sent him wine:</b> Since the elderly find it pleasing, this is the best thing of all for him.

Line 6

<b>A fox:</b> You called Yosef [that] before his brothers? What is his inferiority to his brothers? 

Line 7



Line 8

<b>"Light" - this is Torah:</b> As Haman decreed against them, that they not occupy themselves with Torah [study]. 
<b>This is the Festivals:</b> They observed festivals about them.
<b>This is circumcision:</b> And he made decrees against all of these [things].
<b>Your utterance:</b> This is circumcision, that was given with saying, and not with speech: "And God said to Avraham, 'You shall keep My covenant'" (Genesis 17:9). And we have found that David was gladdened by it, as it is stated (in Psalms 6), "For the choirmaster, upon the <i>sheminit</i> (an eight-stringed lyre, but here taken as a reference to circumcision which happens on the eighth day)" - when he was in the bathhouse and he saw himself without Torah and without commandments; when (he gazed) at the circumcision, he was gladdened.

Line 9



Line 10

<b>The ten sons of Haman, and the ten:</b> The mention of their names, and the word adjacent after them (<i>eseret</i>, the ten). Meaning, their breath failed (the moment of their death was all) together.
<b><i>Zekifa:</i></b> <i>Forche</i> in [old French]. On one side [of it], one below the other.

Line 11

<b>A half brick (<i>ariach</i>):</b> That is the writing.
<b>A whole brick (<i>leveinah</i>):</b> That is the blank that is double the writing; and an <i>ariach</i> is half a <i>leveinah</i>.

Line 12

<b>So that they should never rise:</b> That they should not have a place to extend their steps below [them].

Line 13

<b>This teaches that an angel came, etc.:</b> For he began to speak with an angry expression, but in the end of it, he said, "What is your request."

Line 14

<b>With the document:</b> Such that a written scroll be before them at the time of the reading.
<b>We teach (follow) this version - Rav Nachman said, "Let it be said by mouth, that which is written in the documents":</b> And we do not teach the version - she said to him. And this is its explanation: The order of the verses is thus: "And the Jews assumed as an obligation that which they had begun to practice [...]" (Esther 9:23). "For Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, etc." (24). "But when she came before the king, he said, 'With the document, etc.'" (25). So [it was] Mordechai [who] wrote to them that they should observe Purim, because Haman sought to destroy them, and that Esther came before the king to supplicate to him. All of this should be said, year after year.

Line 15

<b>As the Torah itself:</b> Like [for] a Torah scroll itself, the scoring is a law of Moshe from [Mount] Sinai.

Line 16

<b>The matters of the fasts and their cry. And the decree of Esther:</b> The verses are adjacent like this.

Line 17

<b>Parted from him:</b> Since he neglected [the study of] Torah and entered governance. 

Line 18

<b>Initially</b> in the days of Cyrus, when Zerubavel went up (with him) from exile, Mordekhai was with him, and they were listed in the book of Ezra. There were twenty-four years between [the first] listing and the listing of the later Cyrus. And because Modekhai was made into a minister in between, he went down in his importance for the Sages.

That all the time that Baruch son of Neriah lived, Ezra didn't leave him and Move to Israel (Make Aliyah) - That you have to wonder, why didn't Ezra make Aliyah with Zerubavel from the days of Coresh through the seventh year of Darius the Last, after the Beit Hamikdash was constructed as it is written in Ezra, "And he came to Yerushalaim in the fifth month of the seventh year of the king, etc." (Ezra 7), and in the Midrash, that he was learning Torah from the mouth of Baruch son of Neriah in Bavel, and Baruch did not move to Israel (Make Aliyah) and he died there during those years, and that which we say above, "Baruch prophesized in the year two of Darius in Bavel, he would prophesize and send books to Jerusalem:"

Rashi on Tractate Megillah: "Break the Arm of the wicked" Psalm 10 (9):9 This refers to those who speculate in order to raise the price of grain. And how do we know that it is to these that the Psalm refers? Because it says in this chapter (of Psalms) "He lies in wait in a secret place as a lion in his lair, he lies in wait to ambush the poor." But do robbers wait to ambush the poor? Is it not the rich that they ambush? Thus it is clear that this psalm is talking about speculators, who are mainly focused on the poor. And on this matter, David asked for G-d's mercy: "Break the arms of the wicked," and let the world be granted satiety, and in that way his arm will be broken, and he will not find his evil, the wickedness that he had in mind to do, you will not find it, for he will not be able to do it.

That the sections (of parchment in a Torah scroll, tefillin, or mezuzah) should be evenly divided into thirds. This means that the distance from the top of the stitching to the place where the sinew is sewn should be equal to the distance from that sinew to the second sinew, and from the second sinew to the third should be equal to the distance from the third to the end of the stitching.

Line 21


"Not fulfilled" – He has not fulfilled his obligation, because we require that the Megillah be in a separate scroll of its own, as the miracle is publicized more that way. If one reads it as part of the other Scriptures, it appears as if he is merely reading from Scripture (and not fulfilling the special mitzvah of reading the Megillah).

"...and doesn't downgrade" as it is written: "...the firepans of those who sinned at the cost of their lives and let them be made into hammered sheets as plating for the altar - for once they have been used for offering to the Lord, the have become sacred..." (Bemidbar 17:3). Because they were sanctified they (remained) sanctified.
