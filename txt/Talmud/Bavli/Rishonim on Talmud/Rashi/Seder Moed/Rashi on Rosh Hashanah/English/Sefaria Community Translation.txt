Rashi on Rosh Hashanah



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

"For kings" - they were accustomed to date their contracts by the year of the king from the year of the king's ascension as is said in Tractate Gittin (80a) to have a peaceful relationship with the kingdom. The Sages established the first of Nissan as the start of his year. Even if he ascended to the throne in Shevat or in Adar his [first] year ends when Nissan comes and they start to count the 2nd year.
And for the festivals - This is explained in the Gemara (4a)

Line 2

For animal tithes - Because you cannot give tithes for one year's newborns from another year's as is written (Deuteronomy 14:22-23), "You shall surely tithe all the produce of your field each and every year" and an [anonymous] master said in tractate Bechorot in the chapter Animal Tithes (53b in Bechorot) "[Since the verse uses 2 words to describe tithing when one would've sufficed] the verse is speaking about 2 tithes. The first is animal tithes and the second is grain tithes 

Line 3

For years - this is explained in the Gemara (8a)
For Sabbatical and Jubilee [years] -  when Tishrei comes it is forbidden to sow and plant from the Torah
For planting - For the Orlah counts and even if it was planted in Av its first year ends at the end of Elul and the Gemara will explain the reason for all of this.
For vegetables - For vegetable tithes that you don't separate and tithes [after having mixed] those collected before and those collected after Rosh Hashana

Line 4

For trees - This is talking about the fruit of a tree that was formed prior to that date belonging to the previous tithe year and thus cannot be tithed together with fruit that was formed after that date. In the Gemara it will be explained why Shevat is different.

Line 5

Gemara, with regard to what halacha - That is to say why is there a separate day to count for kings perhaps every King's year should begin from his ascension date [meaning, if king A took over 1 Shevat and King B who took over after him took over 2 Adar the next year perhaps the new year for Kings should be reset from 1 Shevat to 2 Adar in accordance with when the king took power]
For contracts - To figure out whether a contract was post or antedated


Line 6

As was taught in a Mishna - in Tractate Sheviit (10:5)

Line 7

A year is counted for him - That is to say his first year ends and from then they begin counting the second year

Line 8



Daf 2b



Line 1

The [variant text] "What does this teach us?" is in error rather the text is "this teaches us that Nissan is the New Year for Kings..."

Line 2

Where they appointed him - the princes met and concluded that he should be appointed

Line 3

For both of them - Someone who writes a document in the Adar after the first's ascension can write either in year x of the dead king or can write in the first year of the new king
He died in Nissan and a successor took over in Nissan [of that same year] - and it is the law that if he ascended in any month that until the coming Nissan can use both the count of the dead king and that of the new one.
and the second year to the second king - He who writes "from x's ascension" does not count the second year to the dead king because this year was not his and the first isn't counted to the second [king] because he hadn't ascended then rather the second is counted as the second [king's] first year.

Line 4

You might think you couldn't count 2 kings for one year - [your initial thought might be] that since the king didn't reign for long the entire year should be accredited to the first dead king.

As Rabbi Yehudah goes according to the one that said in Sanhedrin (70b) [that] the tree from which Adam ate was wheat.

Line 17

<b>Where the Persians compelled him:</b> And even though he did not intend to fulfill his obligation on the first night of Pesach, he fulfilled [it].
<b>One who blows for the music (<i>lashir</i>):</b> To sing and to play music - that is what I heard from the mouth of my teacher, the elder. But in the work of Rabbi Yitzchak ben Yehudah, I saw, "'One who blows for a demon (<i>lasheid</i>)' - one who blows to chase away an evil spirit from upon him."

Line 18

<b>That is obvious:</b> That this says (means) that.
<b>Lest you say [that] there, the Merciful One said, "Eat matzah"; and he indeed ate:</b> And he derived pleasure by eating it. Hence he is not acting unawares. As, behold, even regarding liability for a sin offering, we say (Keritot 19b), "One acting unawares with [the eating of] forbidden fats and with [intercourse with] forbidden relations is liable, since he derived pleasure."

Daf 28b



Line 1

<b>It teaches us:</b> That even though he is acting unawares, he has fulfilled [the commandment], since commandments do not require intent.

Line 2

<b>The time of reciting:</b> Of reciting the Shema; and he was reading the section of Shema in the Torah.

Line 3

<b>Reading to correct it:</b> There is not even reading here. Rather he is garbling [it].

Line 4



Line 5



Line 6



Line 7

<b>Where he sounded bark-like blasts:</b> And he did not blow like the measure of the blast that is explained in our mishnah (Rosh Hashanah 33b) in the last chapter.

Line 8

<b>However, if so:</b> That one who does not have intent is as if he has intent.
 <b>One who sleeps in a sukkah on the eighth day:</b> Not for the sake of the commandment.
 <b>Should receive lashes:</b> As behold, he is adding to the commandment. So he is transgressing on account of do not add.

Line 9

<b>Commandments can only be transgressed,</b> with do not add, in their times. For example, five species in a lulav, five compartments in tefillin or five fringes on a talit. But the addition of a day upon days or an hour upon hours is not an addition. 

Line 10



Line 11

<b>Where he did not complete:</b> But he rather added it in the middle.

Line 12

<b>It taught, "He completed":</b> In the baraita. 

Line 13



Line 14

<b>That require one sprinkling:</b> For example, the blood of a firstborn animal that was mixed with the blood of another firstborn; or the blood of the tithe.
<b>Require one sprinkling:</b> And behold there is [blood] from both of them in it, so it counts for both of them.
<b>Four sprinklings:</b> Peace-offerings, a guilt-offering, a burnt offering and a thanksgiving-offering.

Line 20

<b>Perhaps Rabbi Yehoshua maintains, etc.:</b> So from these two mishnahs and from the baraita, there is what to object against Rava

Line 21

<b>This is what we were saying:</b> We who brought support from this, the reason of which is because if he encounters another, etc. - this is what we could say to Rav Shemen.
<b>What is the reason that he set aside the mishnah, etc.:</b> He set aside our mishnah, "Those that require one sprinkling" - it is a mishnah in [the chapter entitled] Shechitat Kodeshim.
<b>He should have raised an objection from the mishnah:</b> Since it is more powerful to ask [about].

Line 22

<b>It is not possible that he not sprinkle:</b> If he encounters another [sacrifice]; since we do not waste sanctified foods. 

Line 23

<b>The fulfillment does not require intent:</b> As if he did not have intent, he [still] fulfilled his obligation.
<b>The transgression requires intent:</b> He must have intent for the sake of the commandment. And if not, he has not transgressed.

Line 24

<b>But [what about the case of] the sprinkling of blood, etc.:</b> As he does not have intent for the sake of the firstborn with the other sprinklings; yet Rabbi Yehoshua says [that] behold he is transgressing do not add.

Line 25



Daf 29a



Line 1

<b>Have intent and blow for me:</b> You should have intent to blow in my name, to have me fulfill my obligation.
<b>He who sounds for others is required to have intent:</b> To discharge [the obligation of] the hearer.

<b>and from Yavneh to Usha</b> — when the <i>Nasi</i> was there, for the Sanhedrin was with him. And when he or his son left to another place, the Seating-Place was exiled after him — Yavneh in the days of Rabban Yoḥanan, Usha in the days of Rabban Gamliel, then they returned from Usha to Yavneh, and in the days of R. Shim'on his son they returned, as is taught later on in the chapter (Rosh Hashanah 32a:13) — "and when the court sanctified" etc.
Beit She'arim and Tzippori and Tiberias all in the days of Rabbi <sup>1</sup><i class="footnote">Yehuda ha-Nasi</i> — as is said (Sanhedrin 32b:10) "After Rabbi to Beit She'arim." And later, when he was sick, they brought him to Tzippori, as is said in Ketubot 103b, and he was in Tiberias in the days of Antoninus.
<b>and Tiberias was deeper than them all</b> — they were then lower than all the journeys on which they were exiled.
