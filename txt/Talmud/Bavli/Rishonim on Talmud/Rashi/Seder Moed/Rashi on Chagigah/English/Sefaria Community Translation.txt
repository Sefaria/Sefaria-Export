Rashi on Chagigah



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

<b> Mishna - "All are obligated in the appearance"</b> in the command in the appearing of <i>all your males</i> (Shemos 23:16) - that it they need to be seen in the Temple Courtyard on the Festival.
<b>Except for a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor</b> - that they are not of sound mind and they are exempt from commandments.
<b> The Lame and the Blind </b> - all of these are learned from verses in the Gemara.
<b>And one who is unable to ascend on his legs </b> - from Jerusalem until the Temple Courtyard. And the Gemara explains this (passage).

Line 2

1. <b> Which minor etc. </b> - but from then and on <small>(i.e after he is after to ride on his father's shoulders etc.)</small> even though he is not obligated from the Torah, the Sages placed on his father and his mother to train him in commandments.
2. <b> Three times (regalim) </b> - one who is fit to ascend on his feet (regel) <small>[Translator: Regel means time but also feet in Biblical Hebrew]</small> the verse obligates, and since that an adult is exempt from the Torah (who is unable to walk themselves), (similarly) a minor is not subject to training (in the same scenario).

Line 3



Line 4

[Regarding] the annulment of vows about which the Sages said that a sage may annul a vow, there is [only] a scant hint in Scripture, so it does not have what to be based upon. Rather, such was passed on the Sages in the Oral Law.

Line 5



Line 6



Line 7

From that it states, "in My wrath," it implies that I can ask about [its annulment] - as it was because of My wrath, and I did not swear with a calm mind. We can learn from here that we annul [the vow] for one who finds a hole in his vow, sayin, "I did not make the vow with this in mind - that what I see coming to me because of my vow, would come to me."

Line 8


Since it states, "I shall fulfill it," it implies that if he wanted not to fulfill it, we annul it for him.

Line 8

<b>Four entered the orchard (<i>pardes</i>):</b> They went up to the firmament by way of a [divine] name.
<b>Pure marble stone:</b> That sparkles like clear water.
<b>Do not say, "Water, water</b> is there here; how can we walk?" 

Line 9

<b>Glimpsed</b> towards the Divine Presence. 
<b>Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of His pious ones:</b> His death was difficult before Him, since he died young. But it is nevertheless impossible that he would not die on account of that which is stated (Exodus 33:20), "a man may not see Me and live."
<b>And was harmed:</b> His mind was impaired (he went insane). 

Line 10

<b>They asked ben Zoma, "What is it with regard to castrating a dog":</b> Since [the prohibition] is written amidst the disqualifications of a sacrifice, and even a dog's trade-in is forbidden on the altar - due to [the prohibition of] 'a dog's price' - is it [still] forbidden or not?
<b>A virgin who became pregnant, what is it regarding the High Priest:</b> That is, she says that they would find her hymen [intact]. Or also (another explanation): The High Priest married her and he did not know that she was pregnant, but he found her hymen [intact]; and afterwards she is found to have been pregnant. What is the law [about] maintaining her [as his wife, in view of the Torah's command], "a virgin from his people shall he marry" (Leviticus 21:14)?

Daf 15a



Line 1

<b>I can engage in intercourse:</b> As he was an expert in diversion. So this one also had intercourse like this.
<b>In a bath:</b> A vessel in which one bathes the whole body (a bathtub). And some say that a man cast his sperm there and it entered her innards.

Line 2

<b>Initially:</b> When it came out of the man.

Line 3

<b>From where and to where:</b> From where are you coming, that your mind is preoccupied. 
<b>I was looking:</b> I was contemplating the story of creation.
 
<b>And there are only [three fingers] between them</b> at the place of their connection - the place of the bonds between the top of one firmament and another firmament.


Line 4

<b>The boards of a bridge:</b> When the boards of a bridge are arranged next to one another, it is impossible that there not be a gap between them; and likewise with robes, and likewise with cups.
<b><i>Sechufin</i>:</b> Bent over.

Line 5

<b>Acher chopped down the saplings:</b> He became corrupted and distorted when he entered the orchard, so he chopped down the saplings. And since it compared them to those entering the orchard at the beginning of the words, it used an expression of chopping down saplings.
<b>No standing:</b> We do not teach [the version that includes these words].
<b>No back:</b> Since they have faces on all of their sides. 
 <b><i>Eipuy</i>:</b> Tiredness (<i>Ayefut</i>).

Line 6

<b><i>Pulsei</i>:</b> The striking of a rod; <i>bastons</i>.

Line 7

<b><i>Pulga</i>:</b> A radish.
<b>From a <i>meishra</i>:</b> A furrow.

<b>But they are as easy to lose:</b> By forgetting.

Daf 15b



Line 1



Line 2



Line 3

<b>When he died:</b> Acher.
<b>They said,</b> in heaven, "He should not be judged, etc."

Line 4

<b>There was one among us:</b> There was one student among us who stumbled and went out to an evil path. And do we not have the power among all of us to bring him to the world to come?
<b>If we hold him by the hand, who will <i>marmei</i> (extract) him:</b> If I hold on to his hand to bring him to the world to come, who will take him from my hand? <i>Marmei</i> is an expression of taking from my hand. And there is an example of it in Pesachim (10b), <i>"Armuyei aramayei</i> from him," regarding the loaf in the mouth of the mouse. 
<b><i>Man</i>:</b> It is like <i>mani</i> (who). It is an abbreviated form.
<b>The guard at the entrance</b>  of <i>Geihinnom</i> "could not stand before you, our rabbi," when you came to remove Acher from there.   

Line 5



Line 6



Line 7

<b>It does not state, "to their knowledge":</b> Hence we are dealing with the wicked, and [yet] it says, "Incline your ear."


Line 8

<b>Incline your ear</b> to listen. But forget their deeds, and do not study them.


Line 9

<b>An adult</b> - who knows to be careful not to learn his deeds - may learn Torah from his mouth. 

Line 10

<b><i>Tachla</i>:</b> The outer fruit of the date, which is eaten.
<b><i>Shichla</i>:</b> Its pit, which is thrown out.

Line 11

<b>[Now He is saying]:</b> Now He listened to your voice; and He said a teaching from his mouth.
<b>Woe is Me from My head:</b>  Rabbi Meir said it in Tractate Sanhedrin (46a) in expounding, "for an insult (<i>kilelat</i>) to God is a hanging-person" (Deuteronomy 21:23): <i>Kal leit</i> - I am not light. And it is a euphemism. He ascribed the thing to the Above. "Woe is Me from My arm" - I am heavy from My arm, since I created this one that died in his iniquity. 

Line 12

<b><i>Telei beivra dedasha</i>:</b> Leaning on the bolt.
<b>About our rabbis:</b> About the students who went out to an evil path.
<b>They would weigh</b> [a matter] to expound a minor case from a major case, and a major case from a minor case, according to the weights of the minor and major cases.
<b>Involving a wooden closet (<i>migdal</i>) floating (<i>poreach</i>) in the air:</b> Some explain that they would expound the height of the [letter,] <i>lamed</i>, and they expounded all of this from it. And some explain it is the tower of the generation of the dispersion (<i>Migdal Babel</i>). But to me, it appears the we teach [the version], a closet open (<i>patuach</i>) to the air; and these are from the laws of 'tents' - a wooden closet, that is called a <i>mestier</i>, and stands at the entrance with its opening open to the valley or to the courtyard, which is air. In Tractate Oholot (4:1) there is a mishnah, "A closet that stands in the air."

Line 13

<b>Four commoners:</b> Bilaam, Doeg, Achitophel and Gechazi. It is in the chapter [entitled] Chelek (Sanhedrin 90a).
<b>There was 'mud' in their hearts:</b> They were evil from their [early] days.


Line 14

<b>Acher, what was it:</b> Why did he come to this, and why did his Torah [study] not protect him?
<b>Greek tunes never ceased from his mouth:</b> And he should have desisted on account of the destruction of the Temple - as it is written (Isaiah 24:9), "They drink their wine without song."
<b>Would fall from his lap</b> before he let himself go out to an evil path. Hence he had 'mud' in his heart [from before]. 

Line 15

<b>[Does] all wool that enters the cauldron emerge intact:</b> Does the coloring of all wool, that is put into the cauldron of herbs to color, work or does it not work? This means to say, does the Torah [study] of all those study in front of the sages work to protect them from sin?
<b>All that was clean when it was with its mother:</b> Its coloring works when it did not become dirty in the shearing. That is to say, it works for anyone whose fear of sin precedes his wisdom. So does it appear to me. However my rabbis explain, "[Does] all wool that enters the cauldron emerge intact," as, does everyone that descends to be judged in <i>Geihinnom</i> emerge? "According to its mother" - the coloring works on one-day old wool that has not been trampled in mud. That is to say - if one has merits with him, he emerges. 

Line 16



Daf 16a



Line 1

<b>What verse did he expound:</b> From where did he know the place of the Divine Presence, such that he was careful not to glance there? Or also (another explanation): That he did not err like Acher erred.

Line 2

<b>Exemplary:</b> Something recognizable that stands up as an example to show it, saying, "Do like this to me." And this can only be [with] something recognizable. So too is His place recognizable.
