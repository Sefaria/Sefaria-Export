Rashi on Sukkah



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

"But Rabbi Yehuda would deem [it] fit" - In the Gemara, this difference of opinion is explained.

Line 2

Or it is less than ten [<i>tefahim</i>] tall - The reason is explained in the Gemara.
Three sides - The Gemara will also explain this.
And the sunlight be more than the shade - The minority is nullifed by the majority, and it is as if it is not there, and from the name סכך the סוכה is called. [Showing it is very important].

Line 3

An alley ("mavoi") which is closed on three sides and its head is open to the public domain and courtyards are open to it and they lead to and from the public domain -- see, it is private domain for the people who live around those courtyards. The Sages close it [to prevent] exit from its [private] domain to the [public] domain without an eruv, for each courtyard is its own domain and the alley is the domain of all of them. So the Sages obligate [the residents of the adjoining courtyards] to form a fictitious partnership -- each [resident of] the adjoining courtyards partners [to buy] bread or wine and they place [the bread or wine] in the "shittuf" [the area created through the fictitious partnership] as one. And because it doesn't have a fourth partition and it [appears] very similar to the public domain -- [the Sages] obligated [the residents of the adjacent courtyards to place] an indication at the top of the opening [of the alley] into the public domain or to erect a stake [near the entrance] or [to hang] a beam from one wall to the other. If the beam is higher than twenty armslengths, they should lower it. 

Make smaller - Lower it
He does not need to - The reason is explained there [in Tractate Eruvin].

Line 4



Line 5

Sukkah [Which is] MiDoraysa- That its twenty Amos, is learned [through an exegesis] from the Torah, And from before the Misnah was taught, its שיעור (lit. measurements) was already ''said'' (i.e. comes from, through the rule of the halacha principle:  "taught to Moshe at Sinai") from Sinai.
The Mishnah [therefore] taught it is Posul- it is appropriate to teach (i.e. use)  here [by Sukkah] the language ''Posul'', meaning: it was not done according to the Torah and Halacha.
An alley- Which is all from the Rabbis, since really MiDoraysa it is enough with three walls, and it isn't necessary to ''call it this'' except Md'Rabanan.
[By the alley] it taught its rectification- because it is not appropriate to teach a language of "Posul", for what is it ''Posuling'' before it taught this Mishna?!, for this (this Mishnah) is the first time of its teaching and commandment!                                                                      (in other words: By "Mavoi/alley" the Mishnah couldn't say "Posul" because what is the "P'sul" going on; this is its first time being taught! The langauge or "lashon: of Posul is only stated on a previously taught ruling, that its now coming to teach you that if do it in this particular way it would be Posul. but here, since Mavoi is Md'Rabanan and the Mishna is only now introducing this concept for the first time, it couldn't have used the Loshon of Posul).

Line 6

And if you will ask B'Doraysa also - It (should) and is appropriate to teach its rectification 
Sukkah with many statements - ...and the methods of repairing each are different, so it was necessary to change the wording for each method of repair. For example, if it is too tall, lower it, or if it is not tall enough, raise it, or if it does not have three walls, build one, or if its sunlight is greater than its shade, add <i>sekhakh</i>. Thus it was concise and taught "invalid," since we are able to encompass everything with "invalid," as we hold (Pesakhim 3b), "A person shall teach his student in a concise way."
Mavoi, without many statements - ...in the same Mishnah.

Line 7



Line 8

"so that you should know"- [meaning: You should] make a Sukkah that [the act] of sitting   is recognizable to you, As its stated, " you should know for I have sat you, I've commanded, to sit". This is how he exegesised it, And even though there is a more פשוט way to [explain the verse], that the clouds of glory surrounded [Israel}, Nonetheless, he exegesised it for an exegesis.
That the eyes won't ''rule'' there- for they won't see the S'chach, And [this is important because] A sukkah IS its S'chach, like it sounds like. (meaning that the Hebrew words Sukkah - סוכה has the Shoresh of ס &amp; כ, implying that the Ikur point of a Sukkah is its S'chach spelled סכך).

Line 9

And a sukkah will be for shade - [from which we can draw the] logical conclusion that the covering is only made for shade.
Rather from the shade of the walls- For the shade reaches from this wall to the other wall (זה לזה) because of the height of the walls,  and now you don't need s'chach (to get shade), and later on we establish his argument of R' Zeirah in a case where there is only 4 by 4 [Amos], for it is established by the Rabbi's, that with this shiur there is no shade [coming] from the s'chach, rather only the shade from the walls.

Line 10

Ashteroth Karnayim - Two large mountains and a valley between them. Because of the height of the mountains, the sun does not shine into the valley.

Line 11

[If] you remove the walls, there is no shade of the sukkah - If sun comes from below, it is found that [the sukkah] is invalid.

Line 12

[A sukkah of] seven days- [meaning]: a sukkah that will last [up to] seven days and no more, [meaning] it is temporary, and it is enough to have [only] weak walls.
Higher than twenty [amot] - One needs to make their foundations and their partitions permanent so [the building] does not fall.

Line 13



Line 14

Until Twenty Amos that man makes it... etc.-  It is surely fine that within permanent there is a temporary, and this is made according to Torah [law], and one must say the Torah was not meticulous on temporariness, except for שיעור, to give it a שיעור in its height, that it should be able to stand through weak pegs.

Daf 2b



Line 1

All of them - these Amoraim [namely, Rabbi Zeira, and Rava]. 
Did not speak in accordance with Rabba - who learned from the verse "So that [your future generations] will know..."
This - [The Torah] was not speaking about the knowledge that one is sitting in a sukkah, but rather about the knowledge of the generations to come that booths made of the Clouds of Glory were formed around [their] forefathers.

All of these [statements about] a house are written [in the Bible] - "the doorposts (mezuzot) of your house" (Deut. 6:9); "when you build a new house" (Deut. 22:8); "the one who owns the house shall come" (Lev. 14:35); "[a man] who sold a dwelling-house [in a walled city]" (Lev. 25:29); "[a man] who built a new house" (Deut. 20:5).

And he comes to reduce it - To reduce the height of the space from twenty [amot] by adding height to the bottom

Daf 4a



Line 1

And even if he nullified them - ...for all seven [days], his intention is nullified against other people's, and his nullification does not nullify.

Line 2

Straw and he nullified it - ...verbally, for all seven [days]

Line 3

Straw that he intends not to remove - ...and he will not need to remove it during all the days of the festival, and furthermore, he did not actually verbally nullify them.
Or straw - he placed it there simply, and does not know whether he will remove it or not.
Disagreement between Rabbi Yose, etc. - And indeed, they disagree about earth that he does not intend to remove. Since Rabbi Yose considers it nullified, even if he did not nullify it verbally. And the Rabbis do not consider it nullified. And this, that we chose [to mention] earth placed without any intention, because [it displays] the extent of Rabbi Yose's claim. That even placed simply, without knowledge whether or not it will be removed or not, he considers it nullified. But straw is useful for animals, fire, or cement; therefore, placed without any intentions, it is not nullified, even according to Rabbi Yose.
Our version: a house that he filled with straw or stones, and he nullified them - And this is related to [the transfer or ritual impurity within] tents. A tent containing ritual impurity where there is one tefah of space, it does not break through, above from the roof. But ritual impurity that is confined, where there is not a tefah of space to the roof against it, the ritual impurity breaks through and ascends to the heavens. And indeed, this is a law given to Moshe from Sinai. It follows that a house that contains a corpse or a kezayit of a corpse, and he filled it with straw or stones and nullified them. [The sources of ritual impurity] are confined and break through. But if he did not nullify them, then it is as if he removed them, and there is a space.

Line 4

Straw that he intends not to remove: this is like earth without thought to intention, and it is nullified - And they disagree about straw and also about earth, since stones are equivalent to earth. The Tanna Kamma says that they require verbal nullification. And Rabbi Yose said to him: "If he knows that he will not remove it, then it is considered nullified from there. And stones, even placed simply, when he does not know if he will remove them or not, it is considered nullified. Unless he knows that he will remove it; then it is like straw placed simply, and it is not nullified." It follows that if straw or earth are nullified verbally, then everybody agrees that they are considered nullified. If straw is placed without intention, or earth is placed with intention to remove it, then it is not nullified according to everybody. On straw that he will not remove, and earth of similar nature, or even earth without any intention, it is a disagreement, and Rabbi Yose considers them to be nullified.

Line 5

Palm leaves - ...of the sekhakh, with their ends hanging down
If their shade - ...of the palm leaves is greater than their sunlight, if the sekhakh above [20 amah] were taken away
Valid - Since we measure 20 [amah] from them to the bottom

Line 6

Abaye thought to say - That like a tall [sukkah] is not considered to be lowered and valid when the sunlight is greater than the shade, similarly with a low [sukkah], it is not considered to be lowered to become invalid if its sunlight is greater than its shade, so it is valid.

Line 7



Line 8

Middle wall - For an ordinary sukkah has three walls, as the Mishnah teaches, and the fourth wall is open space.
Along its entirety - That the two ends of the platform touch the two side walls. And the platform is built from stones and cement. If the platform contains the minimum area of valid sukkah: slightly more than seven tefah, which is sufficient to contain one's head, most of their body, and their table.
Valid - The entire sukkah is valid, since it has three walls, even beyond the platform. We measure the space from the platform to the top, and we find that the middle wall is completely valid. The side walls are made valid along the length of the platform. This is a small, valid, sukkah. We say later (19a): trimmings that extend beyond the sukkah are considered to be the sukkah. It is explained that if there is a completely valid section of a sukkah, and trimming extend out from there (trimmings are sekhakh made from the leftovers from threshing and wine casking, as it was usual to do. The trimmings go beyond the valid sukkah area, and do not have three walls, but are considered to be a sukkah. Therefore, the larger entirety of our sukkah is valid.

Line 9

From the side - For instance, if he built the platform against one of the side walls.
If there is from the edge of the platform to the wall - ...(the second wall), that the distance from it is four amah.
Invalid - Since it is not made valid by this this platform. Rather, it only has two walls. The side wall that it touches, and the middle wall that touches the edge of the platform.
Less than four amah, it is valid - ...since even [the third wall] is made valid by [the platform]. Because we hold (below, 6b) a tradition from Moshe at Sinai that a sukkah can be made valid by a wall that bends less than four amah. We consider our sekhakh above, connected to the far wall, as if it it is part of the wall itself, and it bends until it is above the edge of the platform. Here, we measure the height [of the sukkah] from the edge of the platform and up, even though the sukkah continues outwards from under the platform, since the end of the platform does not meet it. Until [the platform], this is our height for the space, and we do not count the space from below the platform.

Line 10

A house where we reduce - ...its roof. Their roofs were made of separate components. They were of equal height, not beveled. And the middle section of the roof is removed.
Sekhakh is placed - ...with valid sekhakh, on the opening, and we find valid sekhakh that is far away from the walls on every side.
Less than four amah is valid - Since the walls of the house are made into valid walls [of the sukkah]. And the ceiling which is invalid [for sekhakh], between [the walls and the sekhakh], is considered to be part of the wall, and the wall into [the sekhakh]. [The ceiling] is not invalid sekhakh; rather, it is a wall that connects to valid sekhakh.

The Ark is nine [hand-breadths] - This is its height, as it is written, "its height is a cubit and a half" (Ex. 25:10), and a cubit is equal to six hand-breadths. 

Daf 5a



Line 1

He said [in a baraita] . . . the <i>shekhina</i> never descended downward - But the Bible says that the <i>shekhina</i> came down onto the cover of the Ark. Derive from this [baraita] that the domain [of the <i>shekhina</i>] stops ten [hand-breadths] above.

Line 2

Ten hand-breadths above - this is a resolution.

Line 3

He was dressed in his clothes - so they were called for him his garments.
He is immediately unclean - as it is written, "Whoever comes into the house . . . will be unclean" (Lev. 14:46).

Or spread over a four-post bed - which is like saying, or even if they did not spread [the sheet] on account of the falling leaves but rather for decorating a bed.

Unfit - because he does not dwell in the sukkah for the tent separates between them.
However, one may spread [a sheet] across a two-post bed - which has only two [posts] and they project from the middle of the bed, one from the head of the bed and one from the foot. They put beam from this [post, at the foot of the bed] to that [post, at the head of the bed] and spread on it a sheet. [The sheet] hangs at an incline on either side, and therefore it does not have a roof of a hands-breadth wide or greater and it is not called a "tent."

On the garment of the people of his household - on his wife's cloak, since he held that the mitzva of tzitzit applies at night. [He interpreted the verse of] "and you shall see it" (Bamidbar 15:39), to exclude the garment of a blind person [who cannot see the tzitzit], but a night garment is still obligated, and thus it is a non-time-bound mitzva in which women are obligated.

Gemara: In your sitting in your house exempt one involved in a <i>mitzvah<i> - ...that he is not obligated in reading the <i>Shema</i> and later it is explained what the implication is.</i></i>
And in your going in the road exempts a groom - ...and even though he is also occupied in a <i>mitzvah</i>, a second verse is needed for him. For if the first had been written, since a groom was not explicitly written in the verse, I would have thought that the verse only exempts one who is burdening and doing the work of a <i>mitzvah</i> with his hands, or traveling for a <i>mitzvah</i>, but a groom, who sits idle and is not involved except for his preoccupation in contemplating marital relations, is not exempted by the verse. Therefore, the additional text teaches us that he is exempt from reading the <i>Shema</i>, for he is preoccupied in contemplating about marital relations.

There is no difference whether on the second day - waving the lulav is only a rabbinic obligation, because Scripture says "on the first day".

Know - for one says [the blessing for] "time" [that is, the <i>shehecheyanu</i>] on it [the eighth day] because [the eighth day] is a festival in and of itself.
For look, it is distinct - from the remaining days [of Sukkot].
In three ways - We do not sit in the Sukkah, we do not take the <i>lulav</i>, and we do not make the water libation, as we learned in a Mishnah (above on page 42b): "Sukkah and the water libation, seven [days]."
And for R. Yehuda also - who disagrees regarding the libation and says [that it is made] all eight [days]. See, [however,] that [the eighth day] is distinct in the [other] two ways.
