Line 5

We learned [in a mishna]: If he shaved on day sixty less one, he has fulfilled his obligation - because the thirtieth day counts for both [terms of naziriteship].
Granted, according to Rav Mattana it works out well - who says that there is no such thing as a naziriteship less than thirty days, and [the nazir] does not shave until the thirty-first day -- we need this [additional] mishna because of the following: that the thirtieth day counts for him for both [terms of naziriteship]; that when he shaves for the first [term] on the thirtieth day, that day counts for him for both [terms], and from that very day the second term of naziriteship starts. Then, once fifty-nine days pass, the twenty-ninth [other texts read: fifty-ninth] day is considered for him to be the thirtieth day [of the second term] and part of a day is like an entire day.
However, according to Bar Padda - why do I need [this additional] mishna to teach us that the thirtieth day counts for him? Twenty-nine days is indeed a [complete] term of naziriteship.

Line 6

Bar Padda could have said to you - I, who said that the fundamental term of naziriteship is just twenty-nine days, [also] rely on this -- that we learned this [additional] mishna and observed that it taught that if he shaved on the fifty-ninth day he has fulfilled his obligation, because the thirtieth day counts for him, because when he initially shaved on the thirtieth day it counted for him for both [terms], and not because we say that "part of a day is like a complete day", so that he would be considered as one who shaved on the thirty-first day. We see, then, that an unspecified naziriteship is only twenty-nine days, and therefore I said earlier that if he shaved on the thirtieth day he has fulfilled his obligation. But the reason of [the ruling of] this mishna is not, as you said, that "part of a day is like a complete day".

Line 7

We learned: one who said "I am hereby a nazirite", if he became ritually impure on the thirtieth day, it negates the entire tally. Granted, according to Rav Mattena - who says that there is no term of naziriteship less than thirty days -- for this reason, when he becomes ritually impure on the thirtieth day, we consider it to be in the midst of "the fullness" [of days: Numbers 6:13] and it invalidates the entire [term]. And if you will ask: didn't Rav Mattena answer earlier that "part of the day is like an entire day"? Here too, let us say that part of the day is like an entire day, and if he becomes ritually impure on the thirtieth day, it should not invalidate anything. But that is no question: Rav Mattena would say to you that the first tanna of [the mishna wherein the statement] Rabbi Eliezer [appears] holds that we do not say "part of the day is like an entire day": the fact that we answer here [6b] that Rabbi Eliezer holds that part of the day is like an entire day implies that the first tanna of Rabbi Eliezer hold that we do not say "part of the day is like an entire day".
However, according to Bar Padda - who says that the fundamental term of naziriteship is only twenty-nine days -- why should it invalidate [the entire term]? He became ritually impure only after the "completion of the days of his naziriteship" [Numbers 6:13].

Daf 6b



Line 1

"Rav Pada would tell you 'the end of of [the Mishna] states that R' Eliezer says he only negate 7 [days of his Nazirite count]" - Corresponding to the days that [a Naziritie would normally ] count, [and get sprinkled] on the third and seventh [day] because of impurity:
"And if you reason that [a Nazirite vow] needs to be 30 days, all [the days of his vow] should be negated." - Rather, this can't be, because the main Nazirite vow, according to R' Eliezer, is only 29 days. And why did R' Eliezer say that 7 days should be negated? It is because he needs to shave after he has been sprinkled [with purifying waters] on the 3rd and 7th days, as scripture says 'On the 7 day he should be shaved.' In principle, no days should need to be negated, since he [the Nazirite] has already counted 29 days in purity. But now, since he has been shaved while he is impure, a Rabbinic enactment goes into effect - 

Line 2



Line 3

We learned: I am hereby a nazirite for 100 days; if he became impure on the one hundredth day, it negates the entire tally - and even according to Bar Padda, since he had said "100 days", he implies [100] complete [days].
And if it enters your mind that Rabbi Eliezer holds that part of the day is like an entire day, let seven days be negated - [seven days] and no more, if he became impure on the hundredth day, because when he became impure, his naziriteship was already past. And according to you[r reasoning], if he does not hold that part of the day is like an entire day, let all of [the days] be negated. Why then does he say "it negates only thirty days"?

Line 4

Actually we do not say part of the day is like an entire day - and that which it says "it negates only thirty days" is a support for Bar Padda. And that which it says "and if he does not hold that part of the day is like an entire day", and the [term of naziriteship] has as of yet not been completed, why does it not negate all of them? [To that] Reish Lakish says, "this is the reason of Rabbi Eliezer" etc.
"This is the law of the nazirite on the day when the days of his consecration are complete" - whether it be a term of naziriteship of thirty days, or whether it be a term of naziriteship of 100 days, give him the halakha of a[n unspecified] nazirite, which is thirty days; and thus he says "it negates only thirty days".

Line 5



Line 6



Line 7

What are the days that require completion? You must say thirty - because a lunar month is only twenty-nine and one half [days], and sometimes it must be "completed" to thirty. This would exclude other [quantities of] days [such as] twenty and forty, which do not need "completion". 
[What, is it not the case that Rav Mattena said his opinion in accordance with Rabbi Yoshiya - who said explicitly that there is no shaving before thirty days? And Bar Padda, who said for the number of days which need completion -] which implies that there should be a naziriteship on those days which need "completion"; of which how many? Twenty-nine.

Line 8



Line 9

Rabbi Yoshiya holds - that which it is written "until [the days] are complete" implies up to, but not including, thirty days. Therefore we need [the verse] "grow long" [to teach us that] there is no growth of hair in under thirty [days].
And Rabbi Yonatan holds "until" means until and including - and we do not need "grow long", since he derives [the rule of thirty-day naziriteship] from "until [the days] are complete".

Line 10

The master said: What are the days that require completion? You must say thirty - which implies that an unspecified naziriteship is thirty days.
But say it is referring to a week - let an unspecified naziriteship be a week, which is six days with the seventh day coming to complete the week. But say that "until the days are complete" means "until a week is complete".
Is there ever [a week that is] lacking - [that is,] which needs "completion"? All weeks are equal, and for this reason we cannot say that the verse is referring to them. But a month, for which [it can be said that] there is "lacking", since there are lacking [months] and full [months], you can say that the verse is referring to [only] months.

Daf 7a



Line 1

But say it is referring to a year - which requires "completion", since sometimes there are 353, sometimes 354 and sometimes 355 [days in a year].
Do we count - a year by days? In the verse it is written "until the days are complete", and it is a month which is counted by days, and it is for this reason that we say the verse is speaking about the thirty days of a month. But not a year, since [a year] is not counted by days, but by months.

Daf 13a



Line 1

If his wife miscarried he is not a nazirite - because perhaps the one she miscarried was not a viable child, since his [term of] months [was] not completed, and he is not considered a child, and uncertainty with regard to naziriteship is treated leniently.
Rabbi Shimon says - this line of argument does not excuse him from naziriteship. 
If he was viable I am hereby an obligatory nazirite, and if not I am hereby a voluntary nazirite - since he holds that uncertainty with regard to naziriteship is treated stringently.

Line 2

If she gave birth again - after having miscarried.
He is a nazirite - since at this time, at least, what he has is a child, and his naziriteship will take effect.
Rabbi Shimon says - perhaps the first was [actually] viable, and his naziriteship took effect [then], and now that she has given birth [again], no naziriteship takes effect. And if he will do it your way [and start the naziriteship upon the second birth -- the birth of the viable child], it will turn out that he will bring [an] unconsecrated [animal] into the [Temple] courtyard. Rather, he should go back and count a second term of naziriteship, and say: if the first [fetus] that she miscarried was viable, the first naziriteship shall have been obligatory and this one shall be voluntary; and if [the first fetus] was not viable, the first naziriteship shall have been voluntary and this one shall be obligatory.

Line 3

Gemara. What is the purpose of stating this - that when his son is born he is a nazirite?
Lest you say - that which he said [when I will have a son] was not intended to mean literally a son; and when he said "a son" he meant "when I will be built up from her", similar to [the verse] "and that through her I too may have children" (Genesis 30:3), and if a daughter, a tumtum, or a hermaphrodite are born let him also be a nazirite. [Rather,] it comes to teach us that he does not [become a nazirite if a daughter, etc., are born].

Line 4

We require a child that is considered significant by people - that is, nothing but a son -- [therefore the mishna] teaches us that a daughter, a tumtum and a hermaphrodite are also called "child".

Line 5

Rabbi Yehuda - who said earlier that uncertainty with regard to naziriteship is treated leniently, as is said in the first chapter (above, Nazir 8a:8) "I am hereby a nazirite on condition that this pile of grain contains one hundred kor, and he went [...] Rabbi Yehuda permits him, since in a case of uncertain naziriteship one is permitted to act leniently."

Line 6

And he separated an offering and his wife gave birth again, what is the halacha - is it [considered] consecrated or not?

Line 7

In accordance with whose [opinion] - are you asking? If according to Rabbi Shimon, it is obvious that it is considered consecrated --  since didn't he say that in a case of uncertainty with regard to naziriteship the ruling is to be stringent? And [even] before his wife gave birth, he would also be considered a nazirite?
Rather one should say that the question was in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who said that in a case of uncertainty with regard to naziriteship the ruling is to be lenient. What is the halakha? - Do we say that since he separated [the offering] when she miscarried, and no naziriteship becomes incumbent upon him at all, it is not considered consecrated at all, and he must consecrate it a second time?

Line 8

What difference is there - whether it is considered consecrated or not? Because now she has given birth, and naziriteship has taken effect for him.
The difference is regarding its shearing and its labor - and this is what [Rabbi Abba] was asking: if you say that from the time he initially separated [the animal] -- when she miscarried -- it was consecrated, its shearing and its labor would be forbidden to him. But if you say that the naziriteship takes effect only when she gives birth a second time, its shearing and its labor would be permitted to him. What is the halakha? [The dilemma] shall stand [unresolved].

Line 9

And another heard him and said: And it is incumbent upon me, what is the halakha? [Does he refer] to the statement - of that man, and imply "and it is [also] incumbent upon me to become a nazirite when you will have a son"? Or perhaps he refers to himself, and he implies as follows: "and it is also incumbent upon me to become a nazirite when I will have a son".


Line 10

Or perhaps - he refers to the other one's statement, and the implication is as if he said "and I love that very same son as much as you do, and I will be a nazirite when you will have a son". And as to the earlier clause, when [Ben Rehumi] asked [about the second person's statement using the formula] "ועלי – and it is incumbent upon me" -- why didn't he ask with this expression ["ואני – and I" too]? [The answer is,] that would not have been possible, because it is not accurate to say the expression "ועלי – and it is incumbent upon me" has the meaning "to love him as much as you do".
And if you say that anything that he says to another in front of him - whether he said "and it is incumbent upon me" or whether he said "and I", the matter is embarrassing to him -- [that is,] to reply to him that "when I will have a son I will be a nazirite", because if it was his intention to accept naziriteship upon himself when he will have [his own] son, why would he take the vow of naziriteship in front of [the first man]? Let him take the vow of naziriteship privately. Rather, since he said this in front of him, it can be determined that he meant to say as follows: I, too, will be a nazirite when you will have a son.

Daf 13b



Line 1

If one said: I am hereby a nazirite when so-and-so will have a son, and another heard and said: And I - this inquiry is likewise relevant if he said "ועלי – and it is incumbent upon me". [Rather, the gemara chose one of the formulas.] So from the Teacher.

What is the halakha - do we say since he responded to the other man away from the presence of the father of the [baby] son, the matter would not be embarrassing for him? And that he spoke about himself, that "I will be a nazirite when I have a son". 
Or perhaps this is what he is saying to him: I love so-and-so as you do - when he will have a son, I will be a nazirite as you are. The dilemma remains unresolved.

Line 2

Mishna. In a case where one said: I am hereby a nazirite now, and I will be a nazirite when I will have a son. He began counting his own term of naziriteship, and before completing his own [first] term, his son was born, and his naziriteship which he vowed to take upon having a son took effect upon him. 
He first completes his own initial term of naziriteship - because he accepted it upon himself first, and afterwards he counts the term of naziriteship that he vowed for [having] his son. Because the [term of naziriteship] for his son took effect before he completed his [first] term of naziriteship, it is treated as one term of naziriteship, and therefore he is unable to shave. 
But if he said "I am hereby a nazirite when I will have a son", which implies a thirty-day term starting now, and he began counting his own term of naziriteship, and after that his son was born -- since he accepted the naziriteship for his son first, he sets his own [term] aside and counts his son's [term], and does not shave. Afterwards, he completes his own [term] starting from the point where he interrupted it.
A marginal note: from the Teacher: since he accepted his own term of naziriteship first, he completes his own [term] -- that is, he shaves in between [the two terms]. In the latter clause [of the Mishna], however, in which he accepted upon himself the naziriteship for his son first, the Teacher explains this as a case where, for example, his own term of naziriteship was for fifty days. He set it up this way for the following reason: if you will say that it is not so [and that it is a case where his own term was a standard term of thirty days], it would not count as a naziriteship at all, since he interrupted his own [term] and started his son's [term], and shaved, he will no longer have the opportunity for his hair to grow abundantly -- we have established in the latter clause  [Nazir 15a:2] that if there is not enough time [upon restarting the count of the first term] to grow the hair, it negates the entire [term].
And if you will say: after counting [the term] for his son, let him not shave. [I will respond:] that is certainly an impossibility. For one thing, since he has accepted [the second term], it is as if he said "I am a nazirite and a nazirite", whereby he must shave between the two [terms]. And furthermore, since it says that "he sets aside his own term of naziriteship and counts that which he vowed on condition of the birth of his son" -- for what reason would he start [the term] for his son if not to be able to bring the sacrifices [at the end of that term] and to shave in between [the two terms].
And if you will say: if this clause is not about a standard term of naziriteship, but about a naziriteship of fifty days, why would it be necessary to state the other clause [Nazir 15a:2] of a naziriteship of 100 days? [I will respond:] because [the other clause] comes to teach us that "up to seventy days he has not lost anything" and that "after seventy days this negates [the first seventy days]". 
End of marginal note.


Line 3

Gemara. Rava asks: [If one said] "I am hereby a nazirite" etc. - that is to say, it is certainly obvious to me that if he said "I am a nazirite after thirty days, and I am a nazirite" for an unspecified term, since he can complete the term of naziriteship that he said would start from now before he starts the term of naziriteship that he said would start after thirty days -- since he said "nazirite" without specifying, which is for a thirty-day term -- therefore his term of naziriteship "for now" can take effect immediately. He can shave after thirty days, and he can then count the term of naziriteship which he vowed to take after thirty days, and then shave at the end of the [second] thirty-day period. Rather, Rava asks the following: if, for example, he said "I am" etc.
Since these one hundred days are not completed within those first twenty days, they do not take effect - from now, and he is permitted to drink wine. Instead, he counts thirty days [of naziriteship] after [waiting] twenty days, and shaves, and afterwards counts 100 days.
Or perhaps since - if he starts to count the 100-day term of naziriteship immediately, he will still have enough [days] remaining to grow his hair, since there will be eighty days remaining, which is enough time to grow plenty of hair. Therefore he would be able to start counting immediately, and count twenty days, and afterwards count thirty [days of the second term], and afterwards count eight days in order to complete the first term of naziriteship.

Line 4

And let him raise this dilemma with regard to a short term of naziriteship - if, for example, he said "I am a nazirite after twenty days, and an unspecified nazirite immediately". Because a thirty-day term can likewise not be completed in twenty days, it should not take effect? Or perhaps it should take effect immediately, [and he shall not shave, and for the entire twenty days he is forbidden to shave and to drink wine and to become impure by the dead. And after twenty days he counts a term of naziriteship of thirty days and does not shave. He then goes back and counts ten to complete the term of the first twenty days,] and he should shave once for both [terms].
Yes, he indeed ought to have raised that dilemma; but rather he raises one dilemma as a result of the other - that is to say, he is inquiring about one term of naziriteship within another term, and asked as follows.

Line 1



Line 2



Line 3

Gemara. A dilemma was raised: Did they also decree the land of the nations impure with regard to the air - and where there is air without earth -- for example, if he entered it in a wagon or a ship, so that he did not step on the ground, but instead entered its airspace -- which is a weak form of impurity.
Or perhaps with regard to the earth - for which it was a stringent type of impurity that they decreed, and not with regard to the air, which is a light form of impurity -- and if he entered it on foot, he is as one who touched a grave. But [if he entered] in a wagon -- [he would] not [be impure].

Line 4

And if you say that the decree was with regard to the air - where there is air without earth, would it be of such a stringent impurity that it would require sprinkling on the third and the seventh?

Line 5

And when the mishna teaches - "and one sprinkles on the third and on the seventh" -- it is referring to the other [items listed] -- to the hanging [branches] and to the projecting [stones], and not to the land of the nations.

Line 6

So too, it is reasonable - that it is not referring to all [of the cases of the mishna], since it [also] teaches "and vessels that are touching a corpse".
Now do these vessels require sprinkling? - That is to say, if the nazirite touched these vessels that are touching a corpse, would he require sprinkling?  [To be read in the intonation of] a question.
Rather learn from this - it is not referring to all of it, but it is rather referring to the others -- on those which require sprinkling.

Daf 55a



Line 1

What, is it not that Rabbi holds that they  decreed impurity on it with regard to the air - and as for this case, since the air enters from above when they are open, or through openings, he would be impure, since he has entered the airspace of the land of the nations.
And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds with regard to the earth - and not with regard to the air -- and since the floor of the chest, box or cabinet interposes between him and the earth, he would be deemed pure.

Line 2

No, since everyone agrees [that the decree] is with regard to the earth - but here, they are arguing about the following: Rabbi, who declares him impure, holds that a moving tent is not called a tent, and it does not constitute a separation. Then [the nazirite] would be as one who is actually walking on the ground. And Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, holds that it is considered a tent.

Line 3

But isn't it taught that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, says: A box that is full of utensils that one threw over a corpse in a tent is impure - as well as all the utensils inside it. Apparently he maintains that a moving tent is not called a tent, and it does not interpose at all.
And if it was placed down, it is pure - since it was placed down it is like a fixed tent, and it protects [the utensils] from the impurity, and it is not like a moving tent.

Line 4

Rather, that everyone agrees that it is with regard to the air - and the following is the reason that Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, declares [him] pure: because he holds that entering the land of the nations in a chest, box or cabinet is an unusual case, and the Sages did not make decrees for unusual cases.

Line 5

And it is taught - [this term] is being used as a support for [the previous statement].
One who enters etc. in a wagon, boat or raft -- that is to say, in a large boat which is equipped with an iskareya -- and is it called this [iskareya] because of its iskareya, which is a mast. And it is called POST or MAST in a foreign language. Because it is a frequently-occurring case, the Sages decreed regarding it. This baraita is according to Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda.

Line 6

And if you wish, say - that everyone agrees it is with regard to the earth, and everyone also agrees that a moving tent is called a tent; and that which [Rabbi] declares him impure here is because he holds that the decree is lest he remove his head and the majority of his body from the chest, box or cabinet. Rabbi Yosei does not make such a decree.

Line 7

And it is taught - as a support to the idea that Rabbi Yosei does not declare him impure until he removes his head and the majority of his body. And that which Rabbi Yosei, son of Rabbi Yehuda, taught above, that if one threw a box full of utensils over a corpse, [the box and everything inside it] is impure -- is not because he holds that a moving tent is not called a tent. Rather, since he threw it, he removes it from the status of being a tent, and equates it with the status of being a utensil. Actually, he holds that a moving tent is called a tent, since it teaches in the latter clause that "if it was placed down, it is pure" -- even though it is normally carried [around]. 

Line 8

Rav Ḥisda said: they taught this - that his days of leprosy do not count toward his naziriteship.
Only with regard to a short naziriteship - when he accepted upon himself a naziriteship of thirty days, and contracted leprosy after he had done ten days, and was confirmed a leper -- those days do not count for him. Because if you say they do count for him, not enough time will remain for him to grow his hair after the leprosy-related shavings.
However, with regard to a lengthy naziriteship - [such as] where he accepted one hundred days upon himself, and contracted leprosy during his term of naziriteship before thirty days had passed, and was shaved with the two leprosy-related shavings -- since there will still be thirty days remaining for him in order to grow his hair, even the days in which he was confirmed [a leper] count for him, and he need only keep thirty days following his leprosy-related shavings, in order to grow his hair for his naziriteship in a state of purity.

Line 9

Rav Sherevya raises an objection - can you infer that the mishna is referring to a short naziriteship? Doesn't it say "he starts counting immediately, and he does not negate the earlier [days]"? What kind of naziriteship could that be referring to? If we say [it is referring to] a short naziriteship of thirty days, can you say that it does not negate the earlier [days]?
Doesn't he require hair growth - after his shaving due to the leprosy? And he will not have that, because there is no "hair growth" in less than thirty days.

Daf 55b



Line 1

Rather, is it not referring to a lengthy naziriteship, and nevertheless it teaches: He starts counting immediately - from the day that he is presently, and he finishes that series of days that began before he was confirmed [a leper]. But the days in which he was confirmed [a leper] do not count for him.
To a naziriteship of fifty days etc. [where he sat and observed twenty days and developed leprosy. He shaves on account of his leprosy and the days in which he was confirmed do not count for him] - because if you will say that they do count for him, he won't have enough [time remaining] in order to grow his hair after his leprosy-related shaving. Therefore following that he will need to sit for thirty days of naziriteship so that he has hair growth.

Line 2

Rami bar Ḥama raised an objection: a nazirite who has uncertain impurity and one whose status as a confirmed leper is uncertain - who possibly became impure on the first day of his term of naziriteship, or if it is uncertain if he was confirmed and healed on the first day of his term of naziriteship.
