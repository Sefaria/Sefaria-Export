Rashi on Kiddushin



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

To her husband
As we will explain later on, "and these three are in female form." And the Gemara will ask why it's taught in feminine form.
Our printing: And she "acquires" herself in two ways
To be within her rights to marry another 
The Braisa explains in the Gemara (5b), [acquisition with money:] give her money or money-equivalent and say to her, "behold you are betrothed to me." Document: write it for her on paper, even though the paper is not worth a prutah, [say,] "behold you are betrothed to me." Through intercourse: come upon her and say "betroth me with this intercourse." All of this is learned from the [written] Torah. 
Beit Shammai's reasoning is explained in the Gemara (11a)
of copper
of silver and its value is eight prutas. 

Line 2

To the deceased husband's widow [yavam]
To be his wife for all matters, for if he came to divorce her afterward, she does not need from him halitza rather a bill of divorce [get]. But money or a document do not have the effect of betrothing her from the Torah, rather from the Sages as they instituted an order, as they say in Yevamot. But (money or a document) do not finalize the betrothal to allow him to inherit from her or become impure for her and do not exempt from halitza, rather they make her forbidden to the other brothers.

Line 3

1 . And what's the difference there--In the second chapter (41a) where it says "the man betroths himself or with his agent," let it say here: the woman becomes betrothed
2. Because it needs to teach money--that with [money] we aquire, and we said previous (4b) "from where do we know that we can acquire with money," and we explain that we learn "take" "take" from the Field of Efron that we consider it an acquisition. Therefore we learn here that [money] can acquire.

Line 4

And from where do we derive that [betrothal is accomplished by means of giving] money? - It is not here where [the Gemara] is asking [about the source for betrothal by money], but rather later on [Kiddushin 3b:4]. Here it is being used [in the course of] an explanation for the entire matter [at hand, namely]: because he wanted to teach [about betrothal through] money, and from where do we derive that [betrothal is accomplished by means of giving] money? We will derive it later on [Kiddushin 4b:3] from "taking." Since "taking" is a term for acquisition, the Mishna uses the expression "a woman is acquired." 

Line 5



Daf 2b



Line 1



Line 2



Line 3

"And let it teach here: A man acquires" - so that it would be taught in the language of the Sages, [namely:] "A man betroths."


Line 4



Line 5



Line 6



Line 7

One examines a zav - with regard to food and with regard to drink, with regard to sickness, with regard to jumping, with regard to a burden, and with regard to a[n arousing] sight, and with regard to the thought [of a woman], in case he saw [the discharge] due to one of these [factors]. [Any of those] would make him a victim of circumstances beyond his control,  and [thereby] pure. As the Torah says, "from his flesh" [Leviticus 15:2] -- [that is], on its own, and not due to [other] circumstances beyond his control. Whereas a woman becomes impure even due to circumstances beyond her control, as is stated in chapter "Samaritan Girls" [Niddah 36b:13]: "When the verse states: “And if a woman has an issue of her blood" [Leviticus 15:25], it is referring to circumstances beyond her control.

Line 8



Line 9



Line 10

And [the Gemara] asks, what is the reason that the mishna teaches "Three" [shalosh, in the feminine] - are you saying because it wanted to teach "ways"?
Let it teach instead the word: "Matters" and let it teach three [shelosha, in the masculine] - as is typical for the Gemara.

Line 11



Line 12



Line 13



Line 14



Line 15

In three ways - just as with [other] trees, the laws of orlah and the fourth-year sapling apply to [an etrog tree]. With regard to the shemitta year, its fruit is reckoned, as for [other] trees, according to the time of its formation, and not according to the time it is picked, as with vegetables.
And corresponding to those of a vegetable in one way - namely, that [the reckoning of its year for the purpose of] its tithes [are according to the time of] its harvesting. For the purpose of tithes, it is not reckoned according to the [year] of its [fruit's] formation like other trees, but rather according to the year in which it was picked, as with vegetables, for which the reason will be given below. Tithes differ over the course of the years: in the first year of the shemitta cycle, the first and second tithe [are taken], and so too in the second [year]. But in the third [year] -- the first tithe and the tithe of the poor. If the [fruit] formed in the second [year] and was picked in the third [year] -- with other trees, [it would be reckoned] according to [the year of] its formation, whereas the etrog [would be reckoned] according to when it was picked, as with a vegetable.


Daf 3a



Line 1

There, [the mishna] teaches us this - that the reason that we reckon [the etrog's year for the purpose of its tithes] according to the time of its being picked is because of its typical properties, [as follows:]
As it is its way to grow by [being watered by] all water - because it is watered by drawn water like a vegetable, which is the reason for [the rule for] vegetables [too], as is stated in Rosh Hashanah: [the terms] "threshing floor" and "winepress" are used regarding tithes, [as in] "as with the new grain from the threshing floor", etc. [Numbers 18:27]. "Just as [the grain that is brought to] the threshing floor and [the wine that is brought to] the winepress are special in that they grow on most water" -- that is, rainwater -- "and they are tithed in accordance with the outgoing year" [Rosh Hashanah 14a:7]. As we have stated in Rosh Hashanah, we reckon [the produce's year for the purpose of its tithes] according to the year in which it reach one-third of its growth [Rosh Hashanah 12b:12], and not according to when it was picked. We derive this from scripture: "so too, anything that grows on most water" -- namely, trees -- "is tithed in accordance with the outgoing year." (Even though their tithes are Rabbinic in origin, we ascribe this rule to scriptural verses.)  "This comes to exclude vegetables, which grow on all water. Consequently, they are tithed in accordance with the incoming year." [Rosh Hashanah 14a:7]

Line 2

Koy - it is uncertain whether it is [classified as a] non-domesticated or a domesticated animal.
There are ways, etc. - since we are in doubt, we treat it stringently.
Correspond to a non-domesticated animal - and require covering of the blood.
And to a domesticated animal - [in that] their  fats [chelev] are forbidden.
Correspond to both a non-domesticated animal and a domesticated animal - [in that] they require ritual slaughtering.
Correspond to neither a non-domesticated animal nor a domesticated animal - [in that] it is forbidden to mate them with either a domesticated or a non-domesticated animal.
This is one of the ways - that one who brings a bill of divorce or manumission from overseas is required to state "it was written before and it was signed before me", [as taught] in the first chapter of Gittin.

Line 3

That there is a distinction - a distinction in its "ways", namely, that in this way it is like that thing, and in this way it is not alike.  Such as, in our Mishnah, "in three ways" -- to exclude [betrothal through the] marriage canopy, which does not serve to acquire. Regarding the zav: it is thus [i.e., one of the seven ways] which is considered circumstances beyond one's control regarding the laws of zav, but not any other type of circumstance beyond one's control [which one would not be penalized for regarding other laws]. Regarding bills of divorce: in these ways they are like [bills of manumission], but not where one says "give this bill of divorce to my wife" or "this bill of manumission to my slave", since one may retract a bill of divorce but not a manumission, since one may act in a person’s interests in his absence.
Is also precise - that where there are no distinctions, [as in the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer], the Mishnah uses expression "with regard to every matter."


Line 4

1. What is the number in the beginning coming to exclude?- three ways.
2.What is the number in the end coming to exclude?- And she acquires herself back in two ways. 

Line 5

To exclude the marriage canopy - If her father delivered her to the marriage canopy for the purpose of <i>kiddushin</i>, she is not thereby betrothed.

Line 6

Exchange - acquisition by [transfer of a] scarf.
Just as a field can be acquired through  exchange - as is written "he drew off his sandal" [Ruth 4:8]. In that case it was a field [that was being acquired].

Line 7

Exchange is effective using less than the value of one peruta - as we have established in the chapter "The Gold": "One can acquire property [through a symbolic exchange] by using a vessel, even if it does not have the value of one peruta." [Bava Metzia 47a:16]


Daf 3b



Line 1

It does not acquire her soul - it is a disgrace to her; therefore the method of chalifin is abolished for her when doing kiddushin. And even with a vessel whose worth is greater than that of a pruta, if you bring it to her with the language of chalifin [it does not acquire her soul] until he brings her according to the laws with the language of acquisition or buying or kiddushin.

A document, with which one cannot redeem consecrated property - if he wrote a document to the treasurer drawing on the funds for redeeming consecrated property, his consecrated property is not thereby redeemed, since we require "he will give the money and it will be assured to him." [Kiddushin 29a:1]

Line 3



Line 4



Line 5

The words of this document are discrete and the words of this document are discrete - in one is written of entering and the other expresses exiting.
This money is discrete - when he gives it, he expresses the purpose for which he is giving it.
Is one - there is nothing mentioned on [the coin] as to whether it is for the purpose of pushing out or taking in.

Line 6



Line 7

Referring to divorce and excluding [a mode of] betrothal - [this is stated] as a [rhetorical] question.

Line 8

And according to Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who derives a different exposition from this verse - in the second chapter of Gittin [Gittin 21b:3].


Line 9

 A matter that severs - that the scroll should separate them, and not that there should be any stipulation in it that [continues to] bind them together.

Line 10

That is not severance - since she is bound to him, for the rest of her days, to fulfill this condition because of him.
That is severance - it even [counts as severance] right away, since she will fulfill his condition and go [her own way], since these stipulations can eventually lead to a [complete] separation.

Line 11

From "karet" [versus] "keritut" - since it ought to have been written "sefer karet", meaning that the scroll severs her; this additional exposition is warranted by the more-elaborate term [that the verse employed, namely: "keritut"].

Line 12

One mode [of betrothal] cannot be derived from another [mode of betrothal], etc. - [the Gemara] asks as follows: the Tanna who earlier asked regarding each [method of betrothal] "can't it be derived using a logical derivation", and who then concluded that they cannot be derived logically, but require scriptural support -- why do we require scriptural support for each of them? Granted that one mode cannot be derived logically from another; but let one mode be derived from two others using the "just as we find in the common denominator of these" argument: that they are capable of acquiring in general and are capable of acquiring here [for betrothal]. "Then I shall even bring" the third [mode and derive its effectiveness from the other two]. All [three modes] are capable of acquiring in other circumstances: money and documents acquire a Hebrew maidservant, as will be stated later on [Kiddushin 14b] and sexual intercourse acquires a <i>yevama</i>.
Money and intercourse; their benefit is great - but a document of betrothal does not have any benefit, all that is written in it is "you are betrothed to me".


Line 13

Their acquisition is great - since they [can be used to] acquire land and slaves.


Line 14

Against her will - intercourse acquires in the case of a <i>yevama</i> against her will, which we derive in Yevamot [Yevamot 54a:3] from "her brother-in-law" [Deuteronomy 25:5]. Similarly, a document divorces a woman from her husband against her will.

Line 15

Against her will, in the case of a Hebrew maidservant - as her father can sell her without her knowledge.


Line 16

Money, which does not enable [the wife] to partake of <i>teruma</i> - if she is betrothed to a priest, as is taught in a Mishna in Ketubot [Ketubot 57b:1]: "A woman may not partake of <i>teruma</i> until she has actually entered the wedding canopy"

Line 17



Line 18



Line 19

Which does not complete [the acquisition of a woman] - to remove her from her father's domain [as pertains to her father's rights] to her handiwork and her inheritance.


Daf 5b



Line 1



Line 2

Likewise, I will bring the mode of a wedding canopy, which generally effects acquisition - in that it completes [the acquisition as far as it pertains to the husband's rights] to inherit from her and to annul her vows. Let [the mode of a wedding canopy] then also acquire here without [any additional act of] betrothal.


Line 3



Line 4



Line 5

That they are effective against her will - that they serve to acquire in general: namely, intercourse [serves to acquire] a <i>yevama</i>, and a document in [the case of] divorce, and money in [the case of] a Hebrew maidservant.
In any event, with regard to marriage, we have not found [a case in which a woman can be acquired through] money against her will - which nevertheless, serves to acquire here [in the typical case of betrothal]. (And even against her will; if, for example, the father accepts betrothal [money] for a minor daughter... [Tosafot on Kiddushin:5a.14.1]) Thus: "Likewise, I will bring the mode of a wedding canopy..." [which generally effects acquisition, rendering a woman as married, and therefore it should also effect acquisition here.]

Line 6

Two refutations of this matter - to that which you said, that the marriage canopy can acquire without [having previously given] money.


Line 7

And furthermore, doesn’t a wedding canopy complete - that which you said, that a wedding canopy completes, etc. -- and since it only [in the typical case, from which you are trying to logically derive its power to betroth,] completes a marriage following [a prior act of] betrothal, how can you then derive [the power of] marriage canopy [to complete a marriage] without [a prior act of] betrothal from [the rule of] marriage canopy with [a prior act of] betrothal?


Line 8



Line 9



Line 10

You are hereby betrothed [mekuddeshet] to me - <i>or</i> "you are hereby betrothed [me’oreset] to me".

Line 11



Line 12

And would the baraita teach in the latter clause a matter that contradicts the first clause - ? in the form of a challenge. When we say, in other places, "for no reason", it is regarding something that did not need to be taught, but was taught for no [particular] reason. But as for a latter clause which would contract a first clause -- that, no Tanna would teach.


Line 13

This is what [the baraita] is saying - in the latter clause: but if he diverges from what we said [he should say]; if, for example, he gave [the betrothal money] and she spoke, it is treated just as if she gave and she spoke, with the result that she is not betrothed. This is because we require "a man takes" [Deuteronomy 24:1].
If he gave - in the mode of "a man takes" [Deuteronomy 24:1].
And she spoke - in the mode of "a woman is taken by a man".
And by rabbinic law we are concerned - that if another man came and betrothed her, she would need a divorce from both of them: perhaps the first one's betrothal was not valid, and the second one's took effect, or perhaps the first one's betrothal was valid and not the second one's.


Line 14

With regard to betrothal, if he gave her etc. - since [Shmuel] wanted to state the latter clause regarding divorce; that is: "he gave her", etc., he chose this terminology.
You are hereby betrothed - and we do not include "to me" in the text [of Shmuel's statement].
There is no room for concern her - there is not even the shadow of a doubt that the betrothal is valid, since it is written that "a man takes" [Deuteronomy 24:1] and not that he takes himself for her. And as for divorce, there is no room for concern [that the divorce is valid], even to disqualify her [out of caution] from [subsequently marrying into] the priesthood.

Line 15



Line 16

Ambiguous intimations - [metaphorically,] a handle for grasping a thing. Even though it is ambiguous, it could serve to grasp onto a complete statement, as here, where he says "you are hereby betrothed," but did not say to whom.
Are considered like unambiguous intimations - where he said that she was to be betrothed to him.

Line 17

<i>Ehei</i> - I shall be.
When a nazirite was passing before him - where by "I shall be" he certainly meant "I too shall be like this one". This indicates that we require an unambiguous utterance.


Line 18



Daf 6a



Line 1

These last expressions are what he teaches us - by which he meant: there is no concern at all that either the betrothal or the divorce [took effect].

Daf 7a



Line 1

And I will be betrothed to you - when he gives [the 100 dinars] to [the other man], he says "be betrothed to me" -- she is betrothed, even though she receives no benefit.
From the <i>halakha</i> of a guarantor - we can derive from that which we find in the Torah, that a guarantor becomes responsible to the lender.

Line 2

Here are one hundred dinars for you, and you become betrothed to so-and-so - and he [acts as] his agent, except that he is betrothing her using his own [money].
She is betrothed - even though the money does not belong to the principal.
From the <i>halakha</i> of a Canaanite slave - as is stated in a mishna later on [Kiddushin 22b:6]: "And he can acquire himself by means of money given by others" -- that others can redeem him with their own money, and he acquires himself and goes out to freedom, even though [the slave] loses nothing at all of his own money.

Line 3

And I will be betrothed to him - to the same so-and-so to whom you give the money on my behalf.
From the <i>halakha</i> of both of these - from both of these laws: we derive it from that of the guarantor and that of the Canaanite slave.

Line 4



Line 5

There, the one who transfers - the owner of the slave who transfers the slave into freedom is the one who acquires the money that he receives for the slave's redemption.


Line 6

And I will be betrothed to you - and he accepts [the money] and says to her: "you are betrothed to me with this."
She is betrothed - as [the Gemara] goes on to explain below.
Property that serves as a guarantee - a person [in this case, the woman] is compared to land, as is written, "you may keep them as a possession." [Leviticus 25:46]
With property that is not guaranteed - that one who sells or gives land and movable property, and the other pulls the movable property, and the land is transferred to him through the pulling of the movable property.

Line 7

But we learned the opposite - that it is necessary to acquire the land using one of the three methods by which land is acquired; namely: money, a document, or by taking possession. [Taking possession means] where he locked [the door of the property], or fenced it or breached [its fence even] a bit [Bava Batra 42a:9]. Then, the movable property is acquired by way of [the land].
We are dealing with an important man - who does not usually [deign to] receive gifts.
Due to the benefit etc.  - that she would want to give a <i>peruta</i> to someone who would flatter [the important man] into accepting a gift from her.

Line 8

And similarly, with regard to monetary matters - this [entire] discussion of Rava's, in which we derive [the law of] betrothal from the law of a guarantor and from the law of a Canaanite slave -- it is likewise applicable to the matter of monetary transactions. If one sold a field to another, and said to him, "give the money to so-and-so and my field is sold to you" -- it is [indeed] thereby acquired, from the law of a guarantor. [If he said:] "Here is 100 dinars, and your field shall be sold to so-and-so" -- that so-and-so acquires  it, from the law of a slave. [If he said:] "Give 100 dinars to so-and-so, and my field shall be sold to him" -- he thereby acquires it, from the laws of both of them.


Line 9

It is amenable to her - to be acquired with any [form of benefit], with an acquisition of any amount, and even the mere benefit of discretion.
<i>Tan du</i> - as two bodies, a husband and his wife, even if she only has the mere [benefit of being able] to instruct [the husband on the disposition of money].

Line 10

Because it can be waived - since one is permitted to waive [his monetary claim].


Line 11



Line 12



Line 13



Line 14



Line 15

There, it is an animal - and it belongs to him, and there is nothing preventing him from sanctifying it. Therefore his utterance has the power to spread [the sanctification across both halves of the animal]. But here, there is another mind as significant as his which can prevent the thing -- since if the woman does not want it, [the money] does not work to betroth her. Only half of her was persuaded, so his words do not effect her [betrothal].


Line 16

This case is comparable only etc. - [this passage serves as] the conclusion of the [Gemara's] reply [rejecting the possibility that the betrothal can spread to both halves]. This case is comparable only to that of an animal belonging to two partners, where there likewise is another mind that can prevent [the sanctification from spreading]. There, we did not say that the animal is fully sanctified by [the actions of] one of them.
It may not be sacrificed - since at the initiation of its sanctification it was not fit to be sacrificed, since only half of it was sanctified. It must be sold and another animal sacrificed using its value.

Line 1

Will engage in sexual intercourse with her and take her to him - that is to say, sexual intercourse with her constitutes taking her [as opposed to their being two separate things].
But perhaps [one can say that with regard to all matters] she is like a wife - just as with a wife, money and a document [act to bethroth] just as sexual intercourse; so too with a <i>yevama</i>, money and a document [act to betroth] just as sexual intercourse -- since it is written "[her brother-in-law will ... take her to him] as a wife" [Deuteronomy 25:5].
"And perform levirate marriage with her" - which connotes sexual intercourse. Scripture repeats it [another word with the root <i>YBM</i>] to preclude [any other forms of completing the levirate marriage].

Line 2

Such is the proper reading: It is needed [to teach] that he can perform levirate marriage without her consent - which is how we expound [the verse] in Tractate Yevamot [Yevamot 8b:14].
If so - if [the verse] is to teach that sexual intercourse [is the only method of acquisition], let it say "and perform levirate marriage." What [then is connoted by] "and perform levirate marriage with her"? To derive that it can also [be done] against her will. This is taught explicitly in a baraita in Tractate Yevamot in Chapter "One who had Intercourse with his <i>Yevama</i>": "And perform levirate marriage" -- sexual intercourse completes her [acquisition], but money and a marriage document do not complete her [acquisition]. "And consummate the levirate marriage with her” -- [he acquires her even if he acted] against her will [Yevamot 54a:5].

Line 3

From where do we [derive] - that a <i>ḥalutza</i> is permitted to marry? Perhaps it only that the Merciful One imposes the commandment to perform <i>ḥalitza</i> upon her, but that nevertheless she does not become permitted [to remarry].
In Israel: The house of him who had [his shoe] removed - the implication is as follows: she is fit to be brought to [another] house in Israel once she has performed <i>ḥalitza</i>.


Line 4

“In Israel” [is written] twice - [the second instance being:] "To establish a name for his brother in Israel” [Deuteronomy 25:7].

Line 5



Line 6

Who is [forbidden] by [only a mere] prohibition - to [a member of] the public [by the verse] "the wife of the deceased shall not become that of another party, outside the family" [Deuteronomy 25:5].

Line 7

What [is unique] about a married woman - who becomes permitted by the death of the husband.


Line 8

That the one who renders her forbidden also renders her permitted - her husband is the one who renders her forbidden -- therefore he can permit her, on the occasion of his death. But the <i>yevama</i>, who is forbidden [to others] by the betrothal of her [original] husband -- how can the death of the <i>yavam</i> permit her?
This as well - when the <i>yavam</i> dies, it turns out that the one who forbids her permits her, for if it were not for [the existence of] the <i>yavam</i>, she would have become permitted once the husband died.

Line 9



Line 10

"So" - "shall be done to the man who will not build up", etc. [Deuteronomy 25:9]

Line 11

As it is written, "lot" - regarding the goats.
And is written "statute" - in [that same] passage. All instances of "statute" are meant [to indicate] an indispensable condition. 

Line 12

The lottery renders it a sin-offering - the goat upon which the lot "for God" falls is rendered a sin-offering.
A verbal designation does not - if he verbally bestowed upon it the designation "sin-offering", it is not thereby established [as a sin-offering]. He must then cast lots upon them, and if the lot falls upon its counterpart, this one will be for <i>Azazel</i>.


Line 13

As one might have thought - that is to say, this verse is necessary for the following reason: I might have thought to say: Just as in a case where a lottery is not used to sanctify [an offering], such as with "nests", about which is written "one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering" (Leviticus 5:7) -- if he cast a lot upon them, they are not thereby designated, and he is able to change [their designation], as we have established in Tractate Yoma: "Nests become designated only upon either the owner’s taking of them, when he initially purchases [ and consecrates them for his offering], or upon the priest’s actual performance [of the sacrificial rite upon them]." (Yoma 41a:2)
A verbal designation does effect the consecration - if he said, at the time of taking them, "this one for a sin-offering and this one for a burnt-offering", they are considered designated, and if he alters [the designation], they are disqualified.
Here, in a case in which the use of a lottery does effect the consecration - as is written, "and Aaron will place, etc." (Leviticus 16:8), is it not logically right, etc.


Line 14

The verse states - it repeats [the term "sin-offering"] to indicate that is an indispensable condition.
One would learn an <i>a fortiori</i> inference - to bring [a law] that is not written in the passage [namely, that verbal designation is effective], even though a term that indicats an indispensable condition [i.e., the word "statute"] is written there. 

Line 15

"For her" - as is written, "and write for her" (Deuteronomy 24:3).

Line 16

“For her” is written twice - [the other time following] "then this latter man rejects her" etc. (Deuteronomy 24:3)
And not for her and for another - if they have the same name; because two women cannot be divorced with one bill of divorce that reads "so-and-so divorces his wives B and C."


Line 17

The verse states, "shoe" - it is a superfluous [word in the] verse "The house of him who had undergone <i>ḥalitza</i> of the shoe" (Deuteronomy 25:10), because it ought to have written [just] "the house of him who had undergone <i>ḥalitza</i>."

Line 18



Line 19

Excluding - a large shoe that he cannot walk with.

Daf 14b



Line 1

<i>Mesulayim</i> - broken through, as [the Gemara] goes on to conclude, "that have no heels." SVLA in a foreign language.


Line 2

MISHNA. Can be acquired through money or through a document - the Gemara will derive the source.
Through years - he goes free after six years.
Or through the Jubilee - if the Jubilee year is encountered during the [standard] six[-year term].
Or through the deduction of money - he can redeem himself; his master deducts the cost of his labor for the years that have already passed from the cost of his redemption, all according a calculation based on his purchase price. As it is written: "The price of sale shall be applied to the number of years" (Leviticus 25:50) -- if he bought him for six <i>Maneh</i>, and he is due to go [free] after six [years], it turns out that he acquires the labor of each year for one <i>Maneh</i>.
More than him - since she acquires herself with all these modes, as well as through signs indicating puberty, as we derived earlier (Kiddushin 4a:3) from "Then shall she go out for nothing." (Exodus 21:11)
Or through the death of the master - and he does not serve [the master's] heirs. But as for a slave who is sold for his initial period, whose master dies within the six[-year term, the slave must] complete [the term] for his heirs. All this is derived in the Gemara.

Line 3

GEMARA. “Out of the money that he was bought for” - this verse is written regarding a Hebrew slave who is sold to an idolator; [the passage containing it begins:] "If a resident alien among you has prospered." (Leviticus 25:47)
Since all of the acquisitions - of an idolator are performed [only] with money; "drawing" of movable property is only stated regarding Jews, as is written "from your neighbor's hand" (Leviticus 25:14) -- until it is drawn from hand to hand. Therefore, [a gentile] can acquire a slave with money.

Yudan the Distinguished - Yudan was his name, and he was a great one of his generation. Anywhere the appellation <i>Biribi</i> is used it has the meaning of wisdom and sharpness.
Only the earlobe - the lobe of the ear, in the flesh and not on the ridge.
And the Rabbis say, etc. - they disagree with [Yudan]. This is their proof: it is established for us that a Hebrew slave who is a priest is not pierced, because this would make him blemished, and he will no longer be able to return to his original status. Later on, we derive from "And he shall return to his own family” (Leviticus 25:41) -- to his status in his family (Kiddushin 21b:12). How then can he be rendered blemished? Did we not learn in a Mishna, regarding blemishes, "[the firstborn is considered blemished, and may be slaughtered outside the Temple] if the ear was damaged from the cartilage but not if the skin was damaged" (Bekhorot 37a:15).
He is pierced only, etc. - you may learn from here that we only pierce on the upper part of the ear.
With regard to what do they disagree - regarding a sharp thorn and a thorn. 

Line 8

Expounds generalizations and details - throughout the Torah, in a place where it generalizes and specifies, he expounds that the specification is an explanation of the generalization, and the generalization only includes what is in the specification. When [the verse] then goes on to generalize again, the latter generalization is only adding that which is similar to the specification.

Line 9

Amplifications and restrictions - [in his method of exegesis,] the specification is not taken as what is meant by the generalization -- that is, you should not say the general term only includes that which is in the specification. Rather, it comes to restrict -- the general term would have included everything, and the restriction comes afterwards to indicate that this, and things similar to it, were what I meant for you by the generalization. Therefore, even if [the verse] does not go on to state another generalization, I would have [known that the rule applies only] to bring things that are similar to the specification. If the verse then goes on to amplify again, it comes to amplify [and include] everything, and there is only one thing excluded. It was given over to the Rabbis to decided which thing was fit to be removed from the generalization. Thus "restriction" is interpreted to mean "restricted somewhat from its connotation."

Line 10

It excludes a corrosive substance - that he cannot place a corrosive substance on his ear and thereby make a hole in it, since that is not similar to an awl, since it does not make a hole through human force, but rather on its own. 

Line 11

The thigh: the most important part of the thigh - in Chapter "Sciatic Nerve", "Rabbi Yehuda says: [The prohibition of the sciatic nerve] applies only [to the sciatic nerve] in one of the animal’s thighs, and logic dictates that it is the right thigh." (Chullin 90b:16) He derives [this ruling] from the letter <i>He</i> of <i>Hayerech</i> [the thigh], and expounds: the thigh -- the most important of all the thighs.

Line 12

And let him be rendered blemished - and what of it? Is not piercing a commandment?

Line 13

It is a novelty - that a Canaanite maidservant should be permitted to a Jew.

Line 14



Line 15

Did you play with tokens - you did not take care to be exact in your studies, but were like those who play with dice / MRYYLS.

Line 16

And if you say that if his master cannot provide him with a Canaanite maidservant - why would I need the explanation that it would render him blemished? Even without that, piercing would be inapplicable, since we require [the slave to be able to say] "I love .. my wife" (Exodus 21:5).
Nothing more - there can be no answer to this [proof].

Line 17

A priest - who is forbidden [to marry a] convert, who [is considered to have been] a <i>zonah</i> prior [to converting].
What [is the <i>halakha</i>] with regard to a beautiful woman - in battle.
Permitted - as it will go on to explain.

Line 18

The Torah spoke - it only permitted it for the sake of the evil inclination, since if it would not have permitted it, he would have violated the prohibition, as is derived later on from the fact that "beautiful" is written -- that the evil inclination inflames him. Therefore, with a priest as well, one must account for the evil inclination, and it is thus permitted.

Line 19

With regard to the second act of sexual intercourse - once his spirit has already cooled off.


Line 20

“Then you shall bring her home to your house” - to keep her.
One can read with regard to: “And see her among the captives" - what he set his eyes upon is then [likewise] permitted to him.


Line 21

When she is a captive - if he had first set his eyes upon her then. But not if he had [previously] bought her in order to sell or to be a maidservant, and then set his eyes upon her.
"A beautiful woman" - this implies that she was permitted to him because her beauty inflamed his inclination. And [she was permitted to him only] reluctantly; but better that a Jew eat meat from a slaughtered dying animal -- that is, from a slaughtered animal that was critically ill -- even though it is loathsome, as is written in Ezekiel, "nor has foul flesh entered my mouth" (Ezekiel 4:14).
And let them not eat the meat of dying animals - after they have died, when they will have become carcasses.


Daf 22a



Line 1

Dying animals - AMORTYYS
"And you have a desire" - scripture makes it depend upon his desire, even if she is not beautiful.
But not her and another woman - that he may not take two.

Line 2

You have the ability to marry her - kiddushin-marriage is valid with although he is a heathen for she does not convert willingly.

Line 3

Such is the proper reading for this <i>baraita</i> in Sifrei in Parashat <i>Re'eh Anokhi</i> (Sifrei Devarim 121:1): "But if he shall say" -- unless he says it and repeats it. If he said [it] at the beginning of his six [years of service] but did not say [it] at the end of six [years of service], he is not pierced, as it is stated: "I will not go out free"; unless he says it when he leaves. If he said [it] at the end of six [years] but did not say it at the beginning of six [years] he is not pierced, as it is stated: "If the slave shall say" -- unless he states it while he is a slave. And this is its interpretation: if he said, and repeated, the two utterances at the beginning of the six [years], and did not say it at the end of six [years], he is not pierced, as is it stated: "I will not go out," which implies close to the [time of] going out. If he said it twice at the end of six, etc. -- unless he says it while he is [still] a slave.

Line 4



Line 5

Such is the proper reading: The Master said: If he said [it] at the beginning of six, etc... Why specifically from "I will not go out free"? Let him derive [it from the fact] that we require, etc... And furthermore, [the <i>baraita</i> states that if he said it at the end and did not say it at the beginning of six he is not pierced, as it is stated: "the slave". Is that to say he is not a slave at the end of six? And the following is its interpretation: if he said it at the beginning of six, etc... it might enter your mind [that it means] actually at the beginning of six [years of service]; let him derive [it from the fact] that we require [him to say] "I love my ... wife and my children", and at the beginning of six he does not yet have a wife and children, since [the master] has not yet given over to him a Canaanite maidservant.

Alternatively - lifting an elephant is possible...
Using bundles of vines - which are three <i>tefakhim</i> high, and one leads [the elephant] onto them. [This is effective] because lifting three <i>tefakhim</i> is considered lifting, which is derived from the law of <i>lavud</i> (Shabbat 97a:17).

Line 2

MISHNA: Property that serves as a guarantee - namely, land, because the surety of everyone -- the borrower and the one who lends to his friend -- is upon it, since it lasts and persists. Therefore, people rely on it.
By taking possession - if he hoed it a little (Bava Batra 54b:3), or walked upon its boundaries (Bava Kamma 9a:3), or fenced it or breached [its fence] even a bit (Bava Batra 42a:9).
Can be acquired along with property etc. - if one sold movable objects along with land. The moment that the buyer acquires the land using one of the three methods of acquisition, the movable objects are acquired along with it.

Line 3

And this property that does not serve as a guarantee <b>binds</b> the property that serves as a, etc. Even though one normally does not take an oath concerning land alone -- as we derive in Shevuot (Shevuot 42b:12) -- where the claim included vessels and land, and one is required to take an oath concerning the movable objects, the movable objects bind the land so that an oath must also be taken regarding [the land]. This [verb] "binds" refers to the property that does not serve as a guarantee, and does not [refer] to the court [as a subject of the verb].

Line 4



Line 5

They taught - that [land] can be acquired by means of money alone only in a place where it is not customary to write a bill of sale.
One does not acquire - since it is customary [to write documents], the buyer does not rely [on the sale being valid] until he takes the document; his primary intention is to acquire by means of the document.
And if he specified - whether my intention is that my money effects the acquisition or my document effects the acquisition.

Line 6

If I wish etc. - for this reason he stated both: so that he would be able to retract [his participation in the sale]. But the seller cannot retract, as it goes on to elaborate: if the seller would want to retract, he would say to him: "I want my money to effect the acquisition." And if [Rav Idi bar Avin] would want to retract, [Rav Idi] would say to him: "I don't want my money to effect the acquisition until the document arrives; as long as I haven't received the document, I can retract."


Line 7

"The deed of purchase" - so we see that there is a purchase even with a deed alone.
Until [the buyer] gives [the seller] money - since the sale is not complete, and does not effect acquisition, until the money is received. And even if the money is received, the document is required, unless [the buyer] specifies [otherwise], as we have stated above.

Line 8

It is thereby sold or given - [at this point, the Gemara] assumes that [the <i>baraita</i>] is teaching that [the seller wrote in the document] either [the "selling" formulation] or [the "giving" formulation].
Due to its poor quality - he prefers to effect the transfer to the buyer by means of a document so that he will not have the opportunity to retract.

Line 9

Rav Ashi says - this <i>baraita</i> is dealing with one who is giving a gift, and it is entirely one [formulation] and not written as either-or; rather, he wrote as follows: "my field is sold and given to you" in order to enhance his power, so that if a creditor of the giver collects from him [i.e., from the gifted field], [the beneficiary] can return to [the giver] and claim the money specified [in the document].

Line 10



Line 11



Line 12

And according to Rabbi Yoḥanan, who says - in Chapter "The Gold" (Bava Matzia 46b:6).
By Torah law money effects acquisition - as we find regarding sanctified property: He will give the money and it will be assured to him (see Leviticus 27:19).
He could answer - don't raise an objection to me from the <i>mishna</i>, because the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>mishna</i> is referring to an ordinance of the Rabbis. The Rabbis abrogated acquisition through money, and said that acquisition takes place only through pulling. This is decreed lest [the seller] tell [the buyer] "your wheat was burned in a loft" (Kiddushin 28b:5).


Line 13



Line 14

Piled on it - that these particular movable objects be resting on that particular land.
And for confession - this is not [included in the] proper reading, since even one who does not own any land can confess as to his tithes, and is able to say "and bless Your people Israel and the soil you have given us" (Deuteronomy 26:15). It is not similar to the first fruits [<i>bikkurim</i>] where one must [be able to truthfully] say "which You have given me" (Deuteronomy 26:10).

Line 1

Where it cannot be demanded - [that is, where] her oath cannot [be imposed] by one witness, as is stated there: that two witnesses who saw that she secluded herself are required, which is derived from [the word] "matter" (Deuteronomy 19:15) [concerning the <i>halakhot</i> of monetary matters and the same word for] "matter" (Deuteronomy 24:1)  [concerning the <i>sota</i>]. (Sotah 3b:19)
Money, where it can be demanded - to impose an oath by [the testimony of] one witness: if he claimed a <i>maneh</i>, and [the defendant] denied it entirely, and one witness testifies that he is liable, he must swear, as it is stated: "A single witness may not validate against an [accused] party any guilt or blame" (Deuteronomy 19:15) -- it is for any iniquity or for any sin that he may not rise up, but he may rise up to [render one liable to] take an oath.  (Shevuot 40a:10)
Is it not logical that one can extend - his oath, to require him to take an oath by way of extension?

Line 2

We found in the case of a definite [claim] - that we extend the oath [in the case of a] definite claim to a case for which an oath would not be required. For instance, regarding land, or [regarding non-land cases] in which [the defendant] did not partially concede -- we would extend an oath [to these cases] if he were liable to take an oath in a different matter.
From where do we derive [that this halakha of the extension of an oath applies also to] uncertain [claims] - Uncertain claims: for instance, the oaths of partners and sharecroppers who [already] divided [the common property]. As is stated in a <i>mishna</i> in Shevuot: "Once the partners or the sharecroppers have divided [the common property, each taking his share], then one side may not require an oath of the other [absent a definite claim]" (Shevuot 45a:10). It further states: "but if an oath was imposed upon him due to some other situation, that oath can be extended to impose upon him any [other oath]." Consequently [in the case of] uncertain [claims] we also extend [the requirement to take an oath].
From where to we derive - if from an <i>a fortiori</i> argument [from the oath of a <i>sota</i>, the cases] are not comparable, since her oath is entirely due to uncertain claims. But as for extension [of an oath] even to uncertain monetary claims -- his essential [requirement to take an] oath only comes about due to a definite claim, as it is stated: "When any party gives" (Exodus 22:6) ["... the owner of the house shall depose before God and deny laying hands on the other’s property"]. The oath of partners is an ordinance of the Rabbis, since [otherwise partners] would rationalize taking liberties with [the property for which they are responsible], as is stated there (Shevuot 48b:12). Since the fundamental [requirement to take an] oath in monetary cases is only [in cases of] definite claims, [the cases to which an oath may be] extended from them must also be definite claims and not uncertain claims.


Line 3

An internal oath - that of a <i>sota</i>, who is required to take an oath in[ternal to] the [Temple] courtyard.

Line 4

Until where - does the power of extension [of an oath reach]; [that is, to what additional] cases that do not require an oath can [an oath] be extended?
Where he said to him: you are my Canaanite slave - even in such a case we extend, if he is [already] required to take an oath in a different matter. In the conclusion, [the <i>gemara</i>] explains what cases beyond [extension of an oath to] land cases [are envisioned] by posing [the question] "until where".


Line 5

One who calls another a slave - a Canaanite slave.
Shall be ostracized - they would ostracize him, since he has disparaged a Jew to such an extent -- they will also disparage him.
Incurs the forty - they would penalize him with lashes for rebelliousness; this is easier on him than being ostracized.
[If one calls another] a wicked person then he may harass him [in all aspects of] his life - that is to say, the court is not obliged to engage in this case, but [the insulted person] is permitted to hate him, and even to reduce his livelihood and harass him in his business.

Line 6

This is a proper claim - and even without extension [of an oath], if he would have partially conceded or if there was one witness, he would be obligated to take an oath, since his claim [that he is a Hebrew slave and thus owes him] labor or deduction [for years not served] is a claim regarding movable objects. In what sense is this beyond other cases of extension of an oath?
He himself is acquired - and this is not a claim regarding movable property.

Line 7

This is [similar to a claim concerning ownership of] land - but we taught in a <i>mishna</i> that we can extend [the oath in such cases]; what additional [concept] is Rav Yehuda teaching us that [a claim of] "you are my slave" is subject to extension [of an oath]?
It would not have generated publicity - therefore the <i>mishna</i> taught that extension [of an oath applies] to it [specifically, but not to a case of a Hebrew slave].

Line 8



Line 9

MISHNA: With regard to all [items] used as monetary value for another item - items for which it is typical to give money when acquiring. At this point, we assume that [the <i>mishna</i>] is discussing a coin: once [the seller] gains [the coin] he is obligated [to furnish] the item being exchanged for it -- if the coin is being given under the rubric of <i>khalipin</i> and not under the rubric of money -- in the way that we acquire by means of a scarf, and in the sense of [the verse] "a man drew off his shoe" (Ruth 4:7).
Once he acquires - [that is, once] the seller [acquires] it and pulls one <i>zuz</i> from the buyer under the rubric of <i>khalipin</i> acquisition, the buyer is responsible for any accidents that happen to the exchanged property, wherever they are -- whether they died or got lost -- [the buyer is still] required to pay [the rest of] the money which he agreed to give him. This is because when the seller pulls the scarf or the <i>zuz</i> under the rubric of <i>khalipin</i>, the goods are acquired by the buyer, wherever they may be.
If one exchanges an ox for a cow - once the owner of the cow [i.e., the buyer] pulls the ox, the cow is acquired by the buyer wherever it may be, and any accidents are his responsibility. The <i>gemara</i> will ask what is meant by [the term] "how so", since [it appeared as if the <i>mishna</i>] was coming to teach us that a coin could be used for <i>khalipin</i> exchange. Even though, if [the coin is given] under the rubric of money, we have established that money does not effect acquisition (Bava Metzia 44a), but only pulling of the goods does -- nevertheless, if he gives him [the coin] under the rubric of "scarf acquisition", the acquisition takes effect just as it would have with an actual scarf. Therefore, the <i>mishna</i> should have read: "how so? If one exchanges money for a cow."


Line 10

GEMARA: What is the [item given in exchange]? [If it is referring to] a coin - ["a coin" in the sense of] that which is usually given as money in exchange for something else, and the <i>mishna</i> is teaching us that although if it had been given under the rubric of money, which we have already established does not effect acquisition -- but if he gave it to him under the rubric of <i>khalipin</i> exchange it does effect acquisition.
One can learn from it, etc. - and we have established in Chapter "The Gold" that a coin cannot be used in a <i>khalipin</i> exchange. (Bava Metzia 46a:5)
Rav Yehuda said: this is what it is saying: With regard to all items that can be appraised when used as monetary value for another item - any item that, if one intended to use it as money to give in return for another item, it would be necessary to appraise its monetary value -- that is, any movable object other than a coin.

<b>The house of the rabbis:</b> The study hall was far from the settlement.
<b>No one should give him lodging</b> to Rav Acha. So perforce he will have to lodge in the study hall. And because of his saintliness, a miracle will happen for him and he will kill the demon.

Line 16

<b>That is incumbent upon the son:</b> For example, honor and reverence.

Line 17

<b>Power:</b> He is able, since there is no one to protest against him.

<b>[If she] is divorced:</b> From her husband. Then she is like one of her [unmarried] sisters regarding the mitzvah of honor.

<b>And so is it logical:</b> That [the parents] be compared [to God] for honor and reverence upon the child; as behold they also partners with the Omnipresent in [creating] him.
<b>There are three partners:</b> It is explained in a baraita in Tractate Niddah (31a): The man emits the white in him. The woman emits the red in him. And the Holy One, Blessed be He, blows into him, a soul, eyesight, hearing of the ear and speech.

Line 22



Daf 31a



Line 1

<b>As she persuades him (<i>meshadalto</i>):</b> She entices him; as we translate (Onkelos on Exodus 22:15), "And if a man entices," as <i>Arei yeshadal</i>.

Line 2

<b>"And the earth is My footstool":</b> So one who transgresses in private is saying the Omnipresent is not here. Hence he is hidden, saying, "He does not know." It comes out that it is as though he is pushing away His feet and shortening Him, saying, "[He is] not here."

Line 3

<b>"The entire world is full":</b> It implies that He extends and descends below. So one who stands with an upright posture appears as [if he] is pushing [God] away.

Line 4

<b>He said this to him:</b> Rabbi Yehoshua answered him in the [same] way that Rabbi Eliezer answered him.

Line 5

<b>[If] she is divorced:</b> Such that my mother is not obligated to honor my father. [If so], what is [the law]?
<b>From your eyelashes:</b> [These are] the hairs in the rows of eyelids. It is evident that you were orphaned, so your eyelashes fell out due to the crying. As it as we say [in Sanhedrin] (104b), "And Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel heard her voice and cried with her until his eyelashes fell out.
<b>That you are the son of a widow</b> And that you do not need [my answer] in practice. Rather you have come to learn, and I tell you that the honor of both of them is the same upon you.
<b>Pour water for them into a pitcher and squawk:</b> Crow to them, as we crow to chickens. And since he did not need to do [this in practice], but he asked him as if he had to do [it] - "my mother and father said" - [Rabbi Yehoshua] answered him with a jocular expression.

Line 6



Line 7

<b>They returned and conceded about the first statements:</b> All the more so is one obligated in His honor. For, like his father and his mother, He too is a partner in one's creation; and his life and death are given over to His hands.
<b>"The beginning of Your word is truth":</b> Scripture was not required to say, "The beginning of Your word is truth," except because they were speaking ill about His first statements, saying He is warning about His [own] honor; but afterwards when they heard the end of His words, they returned and conceded - they learned that the beginning of His words were true.

<b>For six hundred thousand profit:</b> He would have made a profit of six hundred thousand gold dinars.

<b>Once he was wearing:</b> Dama ben Netina. 
<b>A <i>sirkon</i>:</b> A cloak called a <i>cendre</i> (<i>cender</i> - a type of silk).

Line 14

<b>Pheasant:</b> A prized and fatty bird. A type of quail (<i>slav</i>) that fell in the wilderness.
<b>Causes him to be removed from the world:</b> As he will be punished about him, since he showed him stinginess about his meal. 
<b>And there is [one] who makes him grind with a millstone:</b> Which is hard work.

Daf 31b



Line 1

<b>And brings him to the World-to-Come:</b> As he honors him by speaking good and consoling words to him, and he imposes the work upon him with a soft expression. He shows him the imminent need, that they are only able to be sustained by this strain. And the text in the Yerushalmi Gemara (Jerusalem Talmud Kiddushin 1:7:10) has a story about both of them: The story of the one who feeds his father pheasant is [that] one day, his father said to him, "From where do you get all these?" He said to him, "Old man, what do you care, grind and eat" - meaning, chew and eat! He showed him that it was difficult for him. And also a story about the one who grinds with a millstone [is that] he had an old father and the king sent a requisition for his father for the king's work. His son said to him, "Father, grind; and I will go in your place to the king's work which has no limit."

Line 2

<b>Avimi had five ordained sons during his father’s lifetime:</b> But even so, when Rabbi Abbahu called at the gate, Avimi would run and open [it] for him and he would not let one of his sons go [do it].
<b>Yes, yes:</b> I will open [it], I will open [it].

Line 3

<b>It aided him:</b> While he was still bent before him; such that he understood one of the psalms in the book of Psalms that he had not understood [how] to expound beforehand. And some explain that he only expounded this one verse (Psalm 79:1): "A Song of Asaph, God, the nations invaded your inheritance" - It should have stated, "A Lament of Asaph." And he expounded thus - that Asaph said a song that the Holy One, blessed be He, consumed His anger on wood and stone that was in His house; and because of this, exonerated the survivors in Israel. For were it not for this, Israel (lit. the enemies of Israel) would not have left any survivors. And this is what it says, (Lamentations 4:11) "The Lord has spent His fury, He has poured out His fierce anger, and He has kindled a fire in Zion."

Line 4

<b>[Regarding one] such as I:</b> Since I am beloved to my father and precious to my mother - so they do this from me - what should I do?
<b>Since he is a Torah scholar he will be disheartened:</b> If you accept service from him. 

Line 5



Line 6

<b>Fortunate is one who never saw them:</b> As it is impossible to fulfill [the stipulations of] their honor as fully required. So he is punished over them.
 <b>His foster mother:</b> Nanny.

Line 7



Line 8

<b>You are determined to leave:</b>He reasoned that he intended to go back to his place, to Babylonia.
<b>Return you in peace:</b> To your place.

Line 9

<b>He said to him:</b> Rav Asi [said] to Rabbi Elazar, "Perhaps, God forbid, Rabbi Yochanan is angry with me."

Line 10

<b>One who goes to a place on the command of his father:</b> If he knows about the people of the place, that they give honor to his father - to accept words that he would say in his name - he should not attach the honor to himself. And he should attach the honor to his father, even if he knows that they would honor him the same as his father. 
<b>Send me on Father’s behalf:</b> As he needs me. But if the word of his father is not listened to like his own word in a place, he should not attach [it] to his father. For then it is [only] a disgrace.

Line 11

<b>May I be an atonement for his resting:</b> All the bad which is supposed to come upon his soul should come upon me.
<b>From then onward:</b> He already received what he [needed to] receive. For the judgment of the wicked among Israel in Geihinnom is only twelve months.

Line 12

<b>A Sage changes the name of his father, etc.:</b> A Sage, who expounds a teaching in public and whispers [it] to the disseminator who orates [it], changes the name of his father and the name of his teacher. If he is coming to say a matter of law that his father or his teacher said, he whispers to the disseminator, "This is what my father, my teacher said; this is what my master, my teacher said."
<b>But the disseminator:</b> The one who orates it to the public does not change [the name], but rather calls him by his name and says, "This is what x said."
<b>Whose father:</b> Does the disseminator not change.
<b>If we say the father of the disseminator:</b> If the Sage whispers a matter of law in the name of the father of the disseminator to orate [it] to the public in the name of the one that said it, he would not change [it]; to say, "This is what my father, my teacher said." Rather he would call him by his name.
<b>Is that to say the disseminator is not obligated:</b> [Is] he [not obligated] to honor his father.

Line 13

<b>When he would teach at his regular lecture:</b> And whisper a matter of law to the disseminator in the name of Rav Ashi, his father - he would say to the disseminator, "This is what my father, my teacher said."
<b>And his disseminator:</b> When he orates [it] to the public in the name of the one that said it, he says, "This is what Rav Ashi said." And he does not say, "This is what the father and the master of the Sage said.'

Line 14

<b>One may not stand in his place:</b> In the place designated for his father to stand there, in the council of elders with his colleagues, for counsel.
<b>And he may not choose sides (lit., determine it):</b> If his father and another Sage were disagreeing about a matter of law, he may not say, "The words of x appear [correct]."

Line 15



Daf 32a



Line 1

<b>From whose:</b> Does he give him food and does he give him drink.

Line 2

<b>What difference does it make to him (lit. what comes out from him):</b> What loss of money is there  [for] him.

Line 3

<b>They may redeem the second tithe for each other:</b> If his father has second tithe, the son may redeem it with his [money] for what his father needs, without [the extra fee of] a fifth. And we do not say, behold he is like [the father] himself: As surely he loves him and his sustenance is upon him, so he is not a different [person] concerning him; and behold it is like someone who redeems it himself.
<b>And they may feed each other poor man’s tithe:</b> If the son has poor man's tithe to distribute to the poor, he may feed it to his father if his father is poor. And likewise, all of them. And if he did not have have this tithe in his hands, he must give him nourishment from his [funds].

Line 4

<b>For the surplus:</b> It is impingent upon him to give food to him and to give drink to him on a middling level. But if his father requires more of a meal, he may feed him from poor man's tithe.

Line 5



Line 6

<b>That he takes a purse, etc.:</b> And if you say the honor of the father that is upon the child [that involves] monetary loss is only [taken] from the father - if so, that purse that Rabbi Eliezer spoke about is the father's. So what difference is there to the son, [that he would] embarrass him? 

Line 7

<b>But perhaps he would become angry:</b> And he would have said something to his father in anger.
<b>And he would have violated:</b> Rav Huna.
<b>On account of, "before the blind":</b> Such that he would cause his son to sin. 

Line 8

<b>At the seam:</b> In the place of the stitch, such that he would not lose [any] of his money with this; such as at the hem. 

Line 9

<b>Those to be burned [became mixed in] among those to be stoned:</b> It is implied that one [person] who was to be burned was mixed in with many to be stoned. And we have established it (Sanhedrin 79b) [that] all those liable for death penalties in the Torah that became mixed up - and it is not known which of them are with the lighter [punishment] and which with the stringent - are all sentenced to the lighter. For you are not permitted to move over the light to a stringent punishment for which one has not become liable. 
<b>Rabbi Shimon says, "They are judged with stoning":</b> As it is lighter, for Rabbi Shimon [holds that] burning is more stringent than stoning. And the reason is explained in Sanhedrin (50a). 

Line 10

<b>He said to him:</b> Rav Yehudah, his son, [said] to Rav Yechezkel, "Father, do not teach it this way, 'Those to be burned [became mixed in] among those to be stoned'" - and the ones to be stoned would be the majority. As, if so, why did you attach the reason - that burning is more stringent. I will teach it, because it cannot be said that they would all be with burning. For if so, you have gone after the minority. 
<b>Those to be stoned [became mixed in] among those to be burned:</b> As even though those to be burnt are the majority, they are judged with stoning, since it is lighter.

Line 11



Line 12

<b>There it is the Rabbis who are saying to Rabbi Shimon, etc.:</b> That which they said that stoning is more stringent is not that they are giving a reason for their words. Rather they are saying that they be judged with burning, following the majority. And that which you said [that] they should be judged with stoning to be more lenient upon them - you are not being more lenient but more stringent, since stoning is more stringent. 

Line 13

<b>Do not speak to your father like that:</b> To suddenly inform him that he is mistaken; that you said to him, "Do not teach it this way,"
<b>This is what is written in the Torah? He will cause him suffering:</b> And behold, it is as if he is saying to him, "You have transgressed the words of the Torah."
<b>This verse is written in the Torah:</b> And he says to him the verse as it is written; and [the father] will understand by himself that he erred.

Line 14

<b>[If my] father says, "Give me water":</b> And there is another mitzvah before me to do, such as to bury the dead or a funeral.

Line 15



Line 16



Daf 32b



Line 1

<b>Here, is it his Torah:</b> It is in wonderment (given that the Aramaic phrase can also be read as a statement): The honor is dependent on the Torah, and he cannot forgo the honor of the Torah, since it belongs to the Holy One, blessed be He!
 <b>"And in his Torah he meditates":</b> "But his delight is in the Torah of the Lord, and in his Torah he meditates" (Psalms 1:2). At first, it is called the Torah of God; but from when he studies it and reviews it, it is called his Torah.

MISHNA: He is forbidden to her relatives - because they are made equivalent to a slice of forbidden [meat] for him as a result of his admission.


Line 8

[He] is permitted to the relatives of the younger, etc. - since her mother is not believed with respect to her. She doesn't even need a bill of divorce, since if she did require a bill of divorce, she would become his divorcee and he would be forbidden to her relatives.

Line 9



Line 10



Line 11

But she - where she said "you betrothed me", by which she makes herself forbidden to everyone else in the world until he would give her a bill of divorce -- if she had not been certain that he had betrothed her, she would not have said it. [Therefore it would likely be true, and] he would be forbidden to her relatives by her word, even if he does not give her a bill of divorce. 


Line 12

Deem her credible by rabbinic law -- the rabbis deem the mother [credible] with respect to the daughter, and she would require a bill of divorce, and be forbidden to his relatives.


Line 13



Line 14

Forces - him to give her a bill of divorce.
No [ruling of] "forces" is relevant here, etc. - she doesn't require a bill of divorce from him, since the mishna teaches that she is permitted to relatives. If a bill of divorce was required, she would have been rendered forbidden to his brothers as the divorcee of a brother.
Rather, to the latter clause - in which she says "you betrothed me" and requires a bill of divorce.

Line 15

Granted, [according to the opinion that the court] requests - of him that he give a bill of divorce.
It is well - that it has to be by request to cause him to render himself forbidden to her relatives in exchange for her being permitted to marry, since he would not desire that.

"Conceal it in the melody" - while those who were not aware of it and would say the blessing with the four-letter name would draw out the melody, the other Cohanim would quickly say the twelve-letter name, and it would not be heard by the public due to the voices of the others. The Hebrew word 'neima' is equivalent to the sweet voice known [in Provencal] as 'trobar'.
