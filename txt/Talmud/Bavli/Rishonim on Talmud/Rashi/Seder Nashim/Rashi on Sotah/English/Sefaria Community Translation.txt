Line 1



Line 2



Line 3

Mishna: Lest he engage in sexual intercourse with her on the way - since he has to make her drink in Jerusalem, at the Great Court, as [it says] below.
Trusted with regard to her - that he will not have sexual intercourse [with her].

Line 4

Gemara: They taught only - that which is stated in the mishna in Kiddushin: "but one woman may be secluded with two men".
Perhaps one will need etc. - here too, since she is forbidden to both, having two is insufficient, lest the husband or the emissary of the court need to relieve himself, etc.

Line 5

So that there are two witnesses with regard to her - if [the husband] will have sexual intercourse with her, they will testify against him at the Great Court, and they will not make her drink.


Line 6

They taught only - that a woman may seclude herself with two men.
And ten men carried - a married woman on bier outside the city, giving the impression that she was dead, in order to carry out illicit acts with her.

Line 7

That they know how to warn him - and tell him that according to the Torah, when the man is not clean of sin -- that is, when he has sexual intercourse with her after she is forbidden to him -- the water does not evaluate his wife.

Line 8

Her husband is trusted with regard to her - and it is not necessary to appoint witnesses for him.
A sota, who is by a prohibition - namely, "the first husband shall not," etc. [Deuteronomy 24:4], as we say in the first chapter of Yevamot [11b], "Rather, how do I establish the phrase: “After she was defiled” [Deuteronomy 24:4]? It comes to include a sota who secluded herself with another man.

Line 9

That provides - [namely,] that very hermeneutical technique through which you proved your position, it [itself] implies the rule which we are saying, that he requires witnesses.
A menstruating woman, who is forbidden by penalty of karet - he perceives to be more serious, and he will not have sexual intercourse with her.

Line 10



Line 11



Line 12

Because she has the ability to become permitted - when she becomes purified. Therefore his urges will not overcome him, since he is guaranteed [that she will be permitted to him] after a while.
Who does not have the ability to become permitted - if she is found to be defiled, and therefore his heart will pursue her.
Stolen - that is to say, his heart will pursue that which is forbidden to him.

Line 13



Line 14

And they refuted it - as was said, "because she has the ability to become permitted".

Line 15

[The opinion of Rabbi Yehuda] is the same as that of the first tanna - of the baraita.
"But [the Sages] said" - which Rabbi Yehuda does not agree with.

Daf 18a



Line 1

On two pages - like the pages of a Torah scroll, which are made as columns.

Line 2

If one wrote one letter and erased one letter - onto the water, and then wrote the next letter and erased it, until [in this way] completing [the text] in its entirety, as it is written "all this ritual" [Numbers 5:30] -- that it all be [together] as one.


Line 3

For her sake - in a scroll by itself, as it is written, "and he shall carry out with her" [Numbers 5:30] -- for her sake.
Also the erasure - into a cup be for her sake -- that it be evident that the erasure is for her sake.

Line 4



Line 5



Line 6

Administered to her to drink through fiber - which is hollow, the way babies drink.

Line 7



Line 8



Line 9

That has a curse with it - with one of [the oaths] it is written "with the curse of adjuration" [Numbers 5:21]. Later on it will explain what the circumstances are.

Line 10

 I administer an oath to you - with the name [of God], and he pronounces the name.
That you were not defiled - that you are telling the truth that you were not defiled -- that is an oath that does not have a curse with it.
As, if you were defiled, they will come upon you - [that is,] the water [will come upon you] "causing the belly to distend and the thigh to sag" etc. [Numbers 5:22] -- which is the curse.

Line 11

Rava said: the curse stands by itself etc. - there are an oath and a curse here [separately in Rav's formulation], both regarding the woman. However in the verse it is written "with the curse of adjuration" [Numbers 5:21] -- that the oath have the quality of a curse.
I administer an oath to you that if you were defiled, they will come upon you - so, now we have an oath [which includes] a curse [along with it] -- that he administers an oath which states that the curse will take effect.

Line 12

There is no oath - [administered] to the woman, but the verse states "and [the priest] shall administer the oath to the woman" [cf. Numbers 5:21].
I administer an oath to you that you were not defiled and that if you were defiled [all these curses] will come upon you - I administer an oath to you that what you said before us is truthful, that you were not defiled; and if you were defiled, the water will come upon you. Then the oath that she was not defiled will apply to the woman, as well as to the curse that will occur.


Line 13

Mishna. Amen on the curse etc. - therefore she is required to double it.
Neither betrothed nor married - he extends upon her, through the mechanism of the "extension of an oath", [an oath regarding] adultery from the period of betrothal, even though he had not expressed a warning [then]. This, then, is a reference to "extension of an oath" in the Torah.

Daf 18b



Line 1

Nor as a widow waiting for my yavam, nor when married - and if she was his yevamah and he married her and warned her, and she secluded herself, he can extend an oath onto her that she was not defiled while she was a "shomeret yavam". A "shomeret yavam" is one who is anticipating and waiting for her yavam to marry her through levirate marriage. ["Shomeret" is] in the sense of "and his father kept the matter in mind" [Genesis 37:11] and "You would not keep watch over my sin" [Job 14:16].
Amen that I did not become defiled - that is the acceptance of the oath; and if I did become defiled, let [the waters] come into me -- that is the acceptance of the curse, corresponding to the way that [the priest] administered the oath to her that was described earlier in the Gemara [Sotah 18a:12]: "I administer an oath to you that you were not defiled and that if you were defiled [all these curses] will come upon you". And this is the elaboration of [the clause] "amen on the oath; amen on the curse" that was stated in the beginning of the Mishna.


Line 2

Amen that I will not become defiled - that if she will become defiled after some time, the water will destabilize her after she becomes defiled, as is taught in the Baraita in the Gemara [Sotah 18b:12].

Line 3

Nor with regard to after she becomes divorced etc. - and even according to Rabbi Meir, who says that he does stipulate with her on future events.


Line 4

And became defiled - during the period in which she was divorced, since she is only forbidden to return to [her original husband] if she was married [to someone else] by betrothal -- when it says "Then the first husband who divorced her shall not take her [into his household] to become his wife again" [Deuteronomy 24:4], it is referring to after betrothal and marriage, as it says "and becomes [the wife] of another man, then this latter man rejects her" [Deuteronomy 24:2-3].

Line 5



Line 6

Gemara. Who committed adultery - while she was a widow awaiting her yavam.
She becomes forbidden to her yavam - just as a woman who commits adultery while married to her husband becomes forbidden to her husband.
From the fact that the mishna teaches "nor as a widow waiting for my yavam" - [from the fact that] he administers an oath to her regarding adultery that she may have committed while she was a widow awaiting her yavam.

Line 7

Granted, if you say - that if she committed adultery she is forbidden to him -- that is why he can stipulate through "extension [of an oath]" even regarding that adultery. But if you say that etc. ...

Line 8



Line 9

Betrothal does not take effect - for a woman who is forbidden by negative mitzva [alone] to the one who betroths her. But the Rabbis argue, and say that it is only with those [forbidden unions] punishable by karet where the betrothal does not take effect; but with those forbidden by negative mitzva [alone], [the betrothal] does take effect. Therefore according to Rabbi Akiva, [unions] forbidden by serious negative mitzvot are equated to [unions] punishable by karet with respect to the additional prohibitions devolving thereof, [such as the ruling that] the offspring [of such unions] is a mamzer. Regarding becoming prohibited to her husband, too -- just when one has sexual intercourse with a married woman, which is punishable by karet, the woman becomes forbidden to her husband, so too when one has sexual intercourse with a widow waiting for her yavam, which is forbidden [by the negative mitzva] "the wife of the deceased shall not become that of another party, outside the family" [Deuteronomy 25:5] -- she will become forbidden to her yavam. 
Is considered to be - with respect to unions forbidden by a negative mitzva
Like a woman forbidden to him - for which [the punishment would be] karet.

Line 10

Their first marriage - such as if he divorced her, remarried her, and then warned her and she secluded herself.
Concerning the marriage of his brother, what is the halakha - [do we] extend [the oath to include] adultery while married to his brother? Because that which was taught in the mishna -- "when I was betrothed, married, a widow waiting for my yavam or married [through levirite marriage]"  [Sotah 18a:13] -- was not referring to one woman whom the yavam would make drink and swear about [the period of] betrothal and marriage to [the husband's] brother, but rather was referring to individual cases: if it a husband who is making her drink, he can stipulate with her about [the time when she was] betrothed and married; if it is a yavam who married her who is making her drink, he can stipulate with her about [the time when she was] a widow waiting for her yavam and married [through levirite marriage].


Line 11

Therefore he may indeed stipulate with her concerning any case in which she would become forbidden - and she would have become forbidden to him forever on account of her committing adultery during the first period of marriage. The same applies to adultery committed during the period of her marriage to his brother, as is stated in the first chapter [Sotah 2a:3]: "And if her husband dies she performs ḥalitza and may not enter into levirate marriage"

Line 12

When Rabbi Meir said: Amen that I will not become defiled in the future, it did not - enter his mind that she would be evaluated [by the water] now on [events that might take place in] the future.
Will destabilize her - they will return to her throat, like a person who chokes on a liquid appears to gargle. It is the term [expressed in the verse] "they raise a cry of anguish" [Isaiah 15:5].

Line 13

Concerning a later marriage - according to Rabbi Meir who said that he may stipulate about the future, can he stipulate with her using "extension of an oath" that she will not defile herself, if he will divorce her and remarry her and defile herself?


Line 14

And afterward her husband took her back - the reason [he may not stipulate with her] is because she was defiled during the time she was divorced, which does not cause her to become forbidden to him. But he may indeed stipulate now [as to a case where] she was defiled after he took her back.


Line 15

The law of jealousy - one law for all jealousies -- that for all [incidents] he may act with her according to this law.

Line 16

Rabbi Yehuda says [the word] "this" - is a restrictor: this one, but not another one.
Ditch digger - to bring water into the fields and roads for the pilgrims.
With regard to two men - if her husband who made her drink dies, and she was married to another man, and he warned her and she secluded herself -- we accepted Neḥunya's testimony that the second [husband] makes her drink, because Rabbi Yehuda interprets "this" as a restrictor -- that she does not drink and repeat on account of the first husband warning her again; and he interprets "law of" as an amplifier -- that she drinks a second time on account of her second husband. And because Rabbi Yehuda says that she drinks again on account of the second husband, it implies that the first tanna would hold that even the first husband can make her drink twice. Thus we will ask "but according to the first tanna, isn't it written "this"? What does [the first tanna] consider that to exclude?

They issue halachic rulings from their mishnayot -- it says "they erode the world" with mistaken teaching, since they do not know the reasons of the mishna, which leads them to compare it to a thing to which it is not similar. And further, there are many mishnayot which are said like Ploni, and Ploni is an individual voice and the halacha is not established from such. And further, they do not know about the disagreements (machlokot) of the first/former tannaim, who the halacha is like -- and therefore they teach mistakenly.

Line 11


For example, Yoḥani bat Retivi - a widow who was a sorceress. When it would be time for a woman to give birth, she would stop up her womb using sorcery. After she would suffer greatly, [Yoḥani] would say, "I will go and beg for mercy; perhaps my prayer will be heard." She would go and undo her sorcery, and the baby would come out. Once she had a day laborer in her house, and she went to the house of a woman giving birth. The laborer heard the sound of the sorcery shaking in a vessel, like when a baby shakes inside the mother. He came and opened the stopper of the vessel, and the sorcery went out, and the baby was born. Then they knew that she was involved in sorcery.

Is forewarning required - perhaps she will repent, and if she repents she will not lose her ketuba? Or is forewarning not required -- that [even] without forewarning she will lose [her ketuba]?

Line 3

For what [halakha] - since she cannot drink, what does the warning accomplish?
To cause the forfeit of her marriage contract - and if had had not warned her, it would not be forfeited. Thus she requires forewarning. She is [in the category of] one who violates the precepts, since she secludes herself with men.

Line 4

To have her drink when she is married - and if she secludes herself after the wedding, she will drink on account of the warning from [the period of] betrothal; he cannot make her drink when she is betrothed, since we require "while living in her husband's household" [Numbers 5:29].


Line 5



Line 6



Line 7

To render her forbidden to her paramour - the warning's only effect is to render her forbidden to her paramour in case [the husband] dies or divorces her and she did not drink.
Rather in order to disqualify her from [receiving payment of] her marriage contract - which implies that if they did not forewarn her, it is not forfeited.
As we learned - later, in the chapter "Just as the Water Evaluates" [Sotah 27b:4]. 

Line 8



Line 9

It is different there - in that forewarning is required -
as the wife has no fear of her husband  - and if not for the fact that the court forewarned her, we would not be able to penalize her. Since she has no fear, it is no wonder if she violates the precepts [of Jewish women], and it is not excessive licentiousness. But for one whose husband is with her, and [yet] does not fear him and violates the precepts -- that is excessive licentiousness, and one could say that she would forfeit her ketuba even without forewarning.


Line 10

The Merciful One made the requirement to divorce her dependent - as is written, "and he is wrought up about the wife" [Numbers 5:14].
Or perhaps, since [the Torah] objects to this behavior, it is considered as though he objected - that is to say, since it is the nature of a husband to object to this type of behavior, it is considered as though even this [particular husband] objected, against his will.

Line 11

Would we perform a matter that is perhaps not amenable to him? - How would we become agents for him in [doing] something which is a detriment to him, [something] that he does not want? After all, we maintain that "one may not act against a person’s interests in his absence." [Ketubot 11a:4]

Line 12

Who retracted his warning - at this point we are working under the assumption that this dilemma is being raised whether he retracted [his warning] before or after the seclusion. If you say that one who desires to remain married to one who violates the precepts may remain married to her -- that [surely] applies if there was no warning delivered. But where there was a warning delivered, and there was seclusion, and he wishes to retract, what [is the halakha]? Can he abrogate his warning, and [have] her be permitted to him, or not?


Line 13

Would we do something that the husband can come and retract - where there would be a diminution of the [esteem of the] court?
The ordinary situation is that a person concurs with etc. - and we rely on people's ordinary opinion and warn her. If it happens to be that he retracts [the court's warning], it is retracted.

Line 14



Line 15

What is different about Torah scholars? - This is an answer. This is what [the gemara] is saying: in fact his warning is considered retracted, and this evidenced from the mishna. Why do we specifically require Torah scholars? Because they are learned -- [since] she is forbidden to him if he has not retracted his warning, if he happens to [desire to] engage in sexual intercourse, they will tell him "retract your warning."

Line 16

Ze’eira told me - who was one of the men of Jerusalem.
A rebellious Elder - who rebelled against the Court of the Chamber of Hewn Stone, whose death penalty is through strangulation.

Line 17



Line 18



Line 19

Who is prohibited by a[n ordinary] prohibition - [as stated in] the first chapter of Yevamot: "after she was defiled” [Deuteronomy 24:4] includes a sota who secluded herself [Yevamot 11b:2].

Line 20



Line 21



Line 22

With regard to what do they disagree? - what reasoning can we apply to their positions?
Beit Shammai hold that a promissory note that stands to be collected is considered to be as though it was already collected - one who holds a promissory note from his fellow for which he placed a lien on his property: the one who holds the note has a greater strength of possession on the property than the borrower, Therefore, since the property is in [the widow's] possession, the heirs of the husband are considered the claimants, and "the burden of proof rests upon the claimant" [Bava Kamma 46a:9] and it is incumbent upon them to bring proof that she committed adultery during this seclusion and thereby [cause her to] lose her ketuba.

Daf 25b



Line 1

And Beit Hillel hold ... it is not considered as though it was already collected - and we have here that she makes an uncertain claim, because perhaps she did commit adultery. Therefore, [the husband's heirs make a] definite [claim] and she [makes an] uncertain [claim], and "one with an uncertain claim cannot extract from one who has a definite claim". It is incumbent upon her to bring proof that she did not commit adultery.


Line 2

The dispute - in which Rabbi Elazar argues and states that he could marry another etc.
In the case of a barren woman and an elderly woman - where we cannot say that she does not drink but for the reason that she is not fit to remain married to him. Thereupon Rabbi Elazar argues and states that she is [in fact] fit to remain married to him, because he is able to marry another woman.


Line 3

However, with regard to an ailonit - granted that he is allowed to remain married to her; however, she does not drink, for the following reason: we require that she be able to become pregnant. A  barren women [is unable to become pregnant] due to a wound, and an elderly woman was formerly able to become pregnant. An ailonit, however, was already thus afflicted when in her mother's womb, and therefore is not considered fit [to "bear seed"].

What does the teaching mean when it says 'and he was jealous of his wife, and she was defiled,' as we have learned a version that says 'and she was not defiled'? The answer is that the word is ambiguous in her mind, and it is not clear whether she was defiled or not. Rabbi Yishmael did not state his opinion separately, but rather he meant that it is an unspecified case and the matter is subject to interpretation, so let it go.

Line 22



Daf 28b



Line 1



Line 2

And from the place that you came - Since you did not learn that we infer the law of a doubtful case of defilement only from the law of the sotah, go back and study what the sotah law is. What is a sotah who is defiled? She is in doubt according to the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda. This is the appropriate place to hide even a case of defilement in private domain - its status is doubtful. But in public domain, it is pure

Line 3

And what is a sotah? It is a matter that there is a question whether she became defiled or not. Likewise, any case of doubtful defilement, where there is a question whether there was contact with the impurity or not, and the person says 'I do not know.' For example, the laws of a person or of purities that the person was involved with at the time the doubt arose.

Line 4



Line 5

And we asked a question of Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Akiva answered: 'And the same applies to terumah.' Rabbi Akiva then retracted his answer, saying that there is no need to bring a proof from Scripture regarding terumah."

Line 6

And the Gemara concludes: 'And this is the end of the discussion.' It is asked of Rabbi Akiva that he did not mention the word "priesthood" in his response.
...From where does he derive that it is forbidden for a Kohen to perform the service if the deceased is this one? And we cannot say that it is permitted for Terumah now, but forbidden for the Kehunah - this is a question. And even if we were to say that, he would not accept it, because if so, it would be like Rabbi Yishmael.
How does he know that it is forbidden for a Kohen to perform the service if the deceased is this one (i.e. a close relative)? And we cannot say that it is permitted now for Terumah, but forbidden for the service, as it is unclear. Moreover, if that were the case, Rabbi Akiva would have mentioned it. Therefore, Rabbi Ishmael's opinion must be that it is forbidden for both.

The portion of the sota - that which the priest says to her. And we do not say that he has to say it in the sacred tongue as it is written. And in the Sifrei it states that if scripture had not written that it is permitted in any language -- as is explained later -- I would have said that we should learn [the rule] from the yevama by means of an a fortiori inference: If, with regards to a yevama, which is more lenient, [scripture] did not equate all languages with the sacred tongue; sota, which is stricter, is it not all the more so [that the sacred tongue is required]? [Sifrei Bamidbar 12:1]
And the declaration of tithes - in the third year: "I have cleared out the consecrated portion from the house" [Deuteronomy 26:13],  where he removes all of his tithes from his house, and is not permitted to keep them there any longer. He gives the first tithe to the Levite, and the tithe of the poor to the poor. As for the second tithe of the two previous years, he brings them up to Jerusalem now if he had not brought them up already, and declares: "I have cleared out the consecrated portion" -- that is the second tithe. "And I have given it to the Levite" -- that is the first tithe. "To the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow" -- that is the tithe of the poor. He may say it in any language, as is derived later on; and we do not say that scripture required him to say it in this formulation -- that is, to say it in the sacred tongue.
And an oath of testimony, and an oath on a deposit - in any language in which they made him swear. If he denied it, and did not confess, he is required to bring the sliding-scale offering that is specified for oaths of testimony or the guilt offering for robbery that is specified for oaths on deposits.

Line 6

And these are recited in the sacred tongue -  and we do not say that we should derive [the rule for these] from those earlier cases, in which the whole rule of their recitation was written and arranged [in the verses], yet they are not required to be recited in the sacred tongue [exactly as the recitations are] written in all of those cases. This is because scripture states an indispensable condition in [each of] these [following cases].
The recitation of the first fruits - where he recites from "My father was a fugitive Aramean" [Deuteronomy 26:5] until the end of the section.
And the ḥalitza of a yevama - she recites "my husband’s brother refuses" etc. [Deuteronomy 25:7], and he says "I do not want to take her" [Deuteronomy 25:8]. After the ḥalitza she recites "thus shall be done to the man" etc. [Deuteronomy 25:9].
The blessings and curses - that Joshua and Israel recited at Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal.
The Priestly Benediction - the raising of the hands.
The blessing of the High Priest - on Yom Kippur after the service of the day in the innermost sanctum. He would read the Torah portion and recite eight blessings, as is explicated in the Mishna [Sotah 40b:5].
And the Torah portion of the king - as is explicated in the end of the chapter [Sotah 41a:15]; this is the portion of "gather the people" [Deuteronomy 31:12].
And the portion of a heifer whose neck is broken - "Our hands did not shed" etc. "Absolve Your people Israel" etc. [Deuteronomy 21:7-8].
And the portion of a priest who is anointed for war - "Before you join the ... Hear, O Israel! You are about to join ... For it is your God YHVH" etc. [Deuteronomy 20:2-4]. 

Line 7

How - that is, "from where".
And below it states - in [the discussion of] the blessings and curses at Mount Gerizim. Later on [the gemara] elaborates "from where do we derive [that the Levites] themselves [answered in Hebrew] [Sotah 33a:14].


Line 8



Line 9

One does not need to learn from the verse in the form of a gezeirah shavah (a method of biblical interpretation that connects two similar words in separate verses), as the verse is clear and speaks for itself.
"And she shall speak and say: So" - which implies, she shall say [exactly] like this formulation.

Line 10

Which are in Samaria - near the [city of] Samaria.

Line 11

At the bottom in the middle - between the two mountains.
On this side and on that side - on the mountains.

Line 12

Turned - the Levites [turned] their faces towards Mount Gerizim and opened with the blessing. All of the curses were first said in the form of a blessing.
These people and those people - who were on Mount Gerizim and on Mount Ebal. And that which is written, "the following shall stand to bless" [Deuteronomy 27:12] -- it is not to say that the tribes [themselves] blessed and cursed, but that the Levites who stood between the two mountains turned to face Mount Gerizim for the blessing and to Mount Ebal for the curse. 

Line 13

They brought the stones - as is written "there, too, you shall build an altar ... and on [those stones] you shall inscribe every word of this Teaching most distinctly" [Deuteronomy 27:5,8]
 And they took the stones - they dismantled the alter after having brought the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, as is written "you shall offer on it burnt offerings" [Deuteronomy 27:6].

Daf 32b



Line 1

And slept in their place - in their lodging place in Gilgal, and there they set up the stones. 

Line 2

Gemara. We choose the textual variant: "And he shall say to the woman” [Numbers 5:19] -- in any language that she understands [Sifrei Bamidbar 12:1]; the Sifrei derives it from this verse. We do not choose the textual variant "And the priest shall say to the woman" [Numbers 5:21].
To the woman - implying, words that enter her heart -- that she should understand the language.

Line 3

 For what reason she must drink - as [the gemara] goes on to explain, that licentiousness caused you to have to drink.
And from what does she drink - from a repulsive vessel, a clay mekeida.
And on account of what is she defiled - what brought her to the point of becoming defiled? Levity and frivolity. This is to chastise the women, not to behave frivolously with men, because it is through this that they come to "her belly shall distend" [Numbers 5:27].
And in what way did she defile herself? - we tell her the laws of the spell-inducing water -- for what kind of defilement they check -- if she was defiled, and she did it deliberately and intentionally, it will check her. But if she did it inadvertently -- for example, if people told her that her husband died -- or she was forced, it will not check her.

Line 4



Line 5

And why all of this - [why] do we tell her the laws of the water? Granted, [we tell her] those first items, in order to fulfill "and all the women shall take warning" [Ezekiel 23:48]. But why this [item]?
In order not to cast aspersions - if she was defiled against her will, or inadvertently, and was not checked [by the water], that she will not reason "if I had been defiled deliberately, they wouldn't check me either."

Line 6

Here we choose the textual variant: From where do we derive the declaration of tithes? As it is written: "Then you shall say..." And derive a verbal analogy from the saying [mentioned in this verse], and the saying [mentioned in the verse with regard to a sota].


Line 7



Line 8



Line 9

His praise - "I have neither transgressed nor neglected any of Your commandments" [Deuteronomy 26:13] -- that is praising himself.
In a soft voice - since that verse does not include "speaking".
And his discredit - like "My father was a fugitive Aramean" [Deuteronomy 26:5] -- that is to his discredit -- that they are declaring that their father, Laban the Aramean, was a wicked man.

Line 10



Line 11

For what reason did they institute - that a person should recited his prayer in a whisper, as we find with Hannah, "but her voice could not be heard" [I Samuel 1:13].
So as not to embarrass transgressors - who confess to the sins they have committed during their prayers.
As the verse does not differentiate as to place between a sin-offering and a burnt-offering - it did not establish a unique place for the slaughtering of a sin-offering, so that people will not realize that it is a sin-offering and cause him to be embarrassed. 


Line 12

His pain - troubles that came upon him; that is, the troubles that came upon Israel: the trouble of Laban the Aramean and the trouble of Egypt.
"And will cry: Impure, impure" - that is to say, get away from him because he is impure.

Line 13



Line 14

But isn’t there etc. - that is to say, aren't there other signs whereby it can be recognized [that it is a sin-offering]?
Above the red line - as is written "on the horns" [Leviticus 4:30]. But regarding the burnt-offering "horns" is not written; he puts the blood below the red line, and the same goes for all other blood.
There, the priest - alone knows [that it is a sin-offering], and not anyone else, and there is no shame in it.

Line 15

Are covered - the female genitals of a female.
By the tail - by the tail, and therefore [the sex of the animal] is not obvious.

Line 16

A female goat, what can be said? - which does not have a tail, so that the female genitals are plainly obvious.
As he should have brought a female lamb - if he was embarrassed. Because for all individuals' sin-offerings, if he wants [he can bring] a female lamb, and if he wants [he can bring] a female goat. With the exception of the sin-offering for idol worship, regarding which it is written "a she-goat in its first year" [Numbers 15:27] in the portion of "Send Agents".

Line 17

There, let him go and be embarrassed - scripture ordains that he be embarrassed, so that he attain atonement for [a sin] like [idol worship deserving of] great punishment.

Line 1

And he sprinkled it backward - and there [behind him], too, there were vessels that needed sprinkling.
His sprinkling is invalid - since we require intent for purification, as is written: "The pure person shall sprinkle it upon the impure person" [Numbers 19:19] -- that he have intention [to sprinkle] upon him.
Forward to the sides - to the sides while having a forward component, and not the sides while having a rearward component. Here too, those who are standing to the sides of the priest forward from him are included in the blessing, since they are considered to be in front of him. But those who are to his rear, even though they are not actually behind him, are considered to be behind him.

Line 2

"And when he opened it" - and when he began [to read]. This is written regarding Ezra.
They stood up - [i.e.,] they were silent.

Line 3

Who did not wash his hands - prior to ascending the platform.


Line 4

To what do you attribute your longevity - what merit did you have such that you attained longevity?
A kappendarya - to shorten his path [by going] through the synagogue, entering through one opening and exiting opposite it. The term "kappendarya" is explained in Berakhot: "Instead of circumventing the rows, I will enter this one" [Berakhot 62b:18] -- rather than circumventing these rows, I will enter this one and shorten my path. And "darei" means rows of houses.
Nor did I stride over the heads of the sacred people - since the students would be sitting on the floor of the study hall, one who would walk among them when they were [already] seated [in order to] come in and sit in his place would have to widen his stride. That [is the the connotation of] the term "striding" -- it appears as if he is striding over their heads; therefore, he needs to come earlier or sit outside.
And I never lifted my hands for the [Priestly] Benediction - being that he was a priest.
Without a blessing - that blessing as [the Gemara] will go on to explain, "what blessing does he recite?"

Line 5



Line 6

When he begins walking - during [the blessing of the temple] service in order to ascend [the platform], and he turns around to face the ark, what does he say?
And when he turns his face away from the congregation - when he finishes his benedictions, he turns around to face the ark until the prayer leader completes "Who blesses His people Israel with peace."

Daf 39b



Line 1

As You have promised us - that you will approve [of the benediction] by way of our agency, as is written "and I will bless them" [Numbers 6:27].


Line 2

To bend the joints of their fingers - [the priests] spread their fingers while they are reciting the benediction, and after they finish they close their fists like other people. The "joints of the finger" are the segments that are bent and straightened out.
The one who calls is not permitted - the prayer leader who calls out "Priests" [kohanim] in order that they turn around in order to recite the benediction.
Amen - of the blessing of Thanksgiving.

Line 3

The statement - [the announcement] "Priests". 

Line 4

To uproot their feet - from the platform; rather, they stand bent in front of the ark. One can learn from here the order of the Priestly Benediction: how [the priest] uproots his feet from his place during the [blessing of Temple] Service, and comes before the ark, and prays "May it be Your will, ... that this blessing etc." as was stated earlier [Sotah 39a:6]. He prolongs this [prayer] until the congregation's Amen to the [blessing of] Thanksgiving is finished. The prayer leader announces "Priests" if there are two of them; if there is [only] one, he does not make the announcement, and [the one priests] turns around of his own accord, in accordance with Abaye, who stated earlier, "when there is one [priest] he does not call: Priest" [Sotah 38a:15]. When the statement of the caller finishes, he recites the blessing "who has sanctified us etc." [Sotah 39a:5]. After that, they begin the benediction. When the congregation's final Amen finishes, [the priests] turn around and bend their joints if they wish. The prayer leader begins "Grant peace" and the priests pray "Master of the Universe, we have performed that which You decreed upon us etc." [Sotah 39a:6], and prolong it until the prayer leader finishes the blessing. They uproot their feet and go their own way.

Line 5

Until the amen concludes - [that is, the amen] of the blessings over the Torah. All of these [rules about not starting the next utterance before the previous is complete] is due to [the notion that] "two sounds cannot be discerned." [Rosh Hashana 27a:6]

Line 6

Until the Torah scroll is furled - in its wrappings, so that those who are furling [the Torah scroll] not be [so] preoccupied as to not be able to hear the haftarah from the one who recites it.


Line 7

To uncover the ark in public - as long as the public [remains] in the synagogue, because it was their custom to bring the Torah scroll from another building, in which it was kept safe, to the synagogue. They would spread beautiful garments around the ark and place [the Torah scroll] inside it. When they would leave there and take the Torah scroll in order to bring it to the house where it was kept safe, they should not remove the garments from the ark in front of the congregation, since it is a burden to the congregation to be held there with the Torah scroll. Rather, one should take the Torah scroll to its house and place it there, and the public should follow him. Afterwards he comes and uncovers the ark.


Line 8



Line 9

Where there is another exit - when one takes the Torah scroll through its exit, whoever wants to go out through a different exit may do so, even if the Torah scroll has not yet gone out. If there is not another exit, it is proper that the Torah scroll exit first, and one should not go out through the exit before the Torah scroll.
Bar Ahina explained to me - a sage by the name of bar Ahina explained to me: he made me understand the reason for the matter.

Line 10

The people, what do they say? - so that they should appear to show a bright [encouraging] face, and acknowledge his blessings, to demonstrate that they find them favorable.
Bless the Lord, His angels... Bless the Lord, all of His hosts... Bless the Lord, all of His works - these are three verses, corresponding to the three blessings.

Line 11

During the additional prayer of Shabbat - which is a new Priestly Benediction, since [the additional prayer] is not [recited] on the weekday, it is necessary to add something new to what the public says.
Blessed be the Lord out of Zion - this is not in the same psalm, which is why [the gemara] goes on to ask, "And let them also say "The Lord shall bless you out of Zion", as it is written in that same matter."

Line 12



Line 13

During the afternoon prayer of a fast day - during which the Priestly Blessing is recited, which is not the case for other afternoon prayers, due to [potential] drunkenness, as is stated in Tractate Taanit in the last chapter [Taanit 26b:10].

Daf 46a



Line 1

And the priests recite - as was written earlier, "The priests, sons of Levi, shall come forward" [Deuteronomy 21:5], and it did not specify for what purpose they were to approach.
They did not have to recite: “And the blood shall be forgiven for them” - that is to say, "and shall be forgiven for them" which is written in the verse is not in reference to [the phrase] "and they shall make this declaration" [Deuteronomy 21:7]; that is, [not to say] that this too is included in the declaration. Rather, this is a separate matter, wherein the Divine Spirit announced to Israel by way of Moses our Teacher that if they do as such, then "the blood shall be forgiven for them."

Line 2

Gemara. Heifer - which is within its [first] year, and if the year has past, it is disqualified, because everywhere in the Torah where it says "heifer" without further qualification, it must be [no more than] one year old. This is derived from "a calf and a lamb, yearlings" [Leviticus 9:3].
Red heifer - it has no set age.
A  blemish disqualifies it - as is written regarding the red heifer, "in which there is no defect" [Numbers 19:2].
Wherein [bah] - [this word indicates] a restriction.

Line 3

However, if that is so - that anywhere the word "bah" appears is a restriction, and therefore we cannot derive anything from such a case by means of an a fortiori argument.
Other labor should not disqualify - the [red] heifer, since only "yoke" is written regarding it. Rather, we learn it by way on an a fortiori inference from the heifer [whose neck is broken], where it is written "which has never been worked" [Deuteronomy 21:3], which implies any sort of work. If [the term] "bah" serves as a restriction, we would not be able to infer [using an a fortiori argument] from [the heifer whose neck is broken].

Line 4

Why, then, does Rav Yehuda say: If he placed - an uda of sacks upon the [red] heifer -- that is, a bundle of sacks -- it is disqualified, even though that is not a yoke. Moreover, it disqualifies by merely placing it, as is written about the work of the yoke mentioned regarding the [red] heifer, "on which no [yoke] has been laid" [Numbers 19:2] -- the mere laying [disqualifies], even if it has not pulled it.
And as for the heifer, until it pulls - until it carries the load a bit, as is written regarding the heifer [whose neck is broken], "which has never pulled." [Deuteronomy 21:3]. Later, [the gemara] will ask, since no other labors are written about regarding the [red] heifer, and we derive them from the heifer [whose neck is broken], why should burdens which are not literally yokes disqualify with mere laying? [Sotah 46] Nevertheless, we learn from here that we can derive [disqualification by way of] the other labors using an a fortiori inference from the [red] heifer to the heifer [whose neck is broken], even though "bah", a term of restriction, is written there.
The [red] heifer is different as we learn “yoke” "yoke” - and since the verbal analogy is available, it is as if [the law that any labor is disqualifying] was written regarding [the red heifer] itself. The restriction of "bah" [that some law be unique to the heifer whose neck is broken] was expounded for a different purpose, as indicated below.

Line 5

The heifer [whose neck is broken] should also be derived from the “yoke” “yoke” [verbal analogy] with the red heifer - [as far as] a blemish [being disqualifying].

Line 6

To exclude sacred offerings which are not disqualified by labor - [i.e., not disqualified] from being brought as offerings. But the [red] heifer is not excluded, since [the law that it is indeed disqualified by labor] comes from a verbal analogy.


Line 7

 Is that to say that there are none that are disqualified by years? - Aren't there the Passover offering and the sin offering, by which is written "within their first year"? When is "bah" needed to exclude something from being disqualified by labor? It is for [these cases], for if they were not excluded [with "bah"], it would have been derived [that labor does disqualify them] using an a fortiori inference from the heifer [whose neck is broken].


Line 8


Prohibited labor - for example, on Shabbat or with "diverse kinds" -- [that is,] with an ox and donkey.


Line 9

Prohibited labor is also derived from this verse - since two verses discuss [reasons for disqualification of sacrifices], it must be that one of them is [coming to teach that] prohibited labor [does not disqualify].


Line 10



Line 11

Yoke - this baraita was taught regarding the [red] heifer.
Other types of labor disqualify it - for it is written "which has never been worked." [Deuteronomy 21:3].

Line 12

And if it is your wish to say - and if you can refute this a fortiori argument, go and learn it by way of a verbal analogy [instead]: "It is stated here, “yoke”," etc.
It is stated here, etc. - and this word "yoke" [regarding the heifer whose neck is broken] is superfluous, since ["yoke"] is included in the category of all labors.

Line 13

What [is the meaning of]: If it is your wish to say? - how could you have refuted [the a fortiori inference] so that the Tanna would depart from his course and derive it by way of verbal analogy.


Line 14

And from the place that you came  - this is not the teaching of the Tanna [i.e., this is no longer a quote from the baraita]; rather the Gemara proceeds to elaborate on the question that is being raised against Rav Yehudah, who had said earlier [Sotah 46a:11] that other types of loads disqualify the [red] heifer by mere placement. Since other types of loads are not [explicitly] written by the [red] heifer, and [must be] derived from the heifer [whose neck is broken] by way of verbal analogy -- you could have also derived from the place whence you came that just as a heifer [whose neck is broken is not qualified] until it pulls [the load], so too the [red] heifer [is not disqualified] by other types of loads until it pulls, since [its law] is derived from the heifer [whose neck is broken].

(Sanhedrin 51b)

"From the time when Rabban Gamliel the Elder died, the honor of the Torah ceased" - In Megillah 21a, it says that until he died, there was health in the world and people would only learn Torah standing. From the time that he died, weakness/illness descended on the world and they needed to learn Torah sitting.
