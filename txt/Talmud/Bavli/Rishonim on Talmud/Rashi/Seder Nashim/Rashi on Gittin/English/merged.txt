Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

מתני' המביא גט ממדינת הים AN AGENT BRINGS A DIVORCE DOCUMENT [GET] FROM OVERSEAS — All land outside of Eretz Yisrael is called overseas except for Babel, as it says further (Gittin 6a).
צריך THE AGENT MUST — The agent bringing the get must state the formula, and the reason is explained in the Gemara. The husband sent this agent in order to deliver the divorce document.

Line 2

רקם וחגר REKEM AND ḤEGER — Translation of "Kadeish and Bared," as they were translated "between Rekem and Ḥeger" (Genesis 16:14).
אפילו מכפר לודים EVEN FROM THE VILLAGE OF LUDIM TO LOD — Which [the village of Ludim] is outside of Eretz Yisrael.
ללוד TO LOD — Which is close to the village of Ludim, but is in Eretz Yisrael. The Gemara explains this argument [between the Tanna Kamma and Rabban Gamliel]

Line 4

To his slave - [his] Caananite [slave].
Do for me - work, but I will not sustain you; rather, circulate about the entryways [to beg for food]. 

Line 5



Line 6

 A case in which [her earnings] are not sufficient - to sustain herself with her earnings, and [the husband] must add from his own [funds].


Line 7

And [the Gemara] asks: [the case of] a slave also [is referring to a situation where his earnings] are not sufficient. And [the Gemara] answers: A slave who is not worth the bread of his stomach - a slave who is not worth the bread that he consumes.
For what is he needed by ... his master - therefore, [the master] does not add from his own funds; rather, [the slave] should circulate by the entryways, since who will force [the master] to sustain him and incur a loss? But as for a woman, he agreed to the following stipulation in her ketuba: "You will sit in my house and be sustained from my property." [Ketubot 4:12].

Within - she is modest, and is not accustomed to go out and circulate around a city that she doesn't come from. People do not know her [and therefore don't know] to bring her work at her home; rather, she has to circulate around the city in order to find work in order to make a profit.

Line 4

From when do we count for a divorce document - three months that a woman must wait.

Line 5



Line 6

An old divorce document - Later on (Gitin, page 79b) we learn: It was taught in a Mishnah that one does not divorce with an old divorce document. And what is considered an old divorce document? It is one that has been specifically designated for her, since it was written for her. The reason is that we are concerned people might say that the divorce document predates the marriage, and perhaps she conceived and gave birth between the time of its writing and its delivery. And after some time, people might say that the divorce document came first, and in the case of adultery, she has already conceived.

Line 7



Line 8



Line 9



Line 10

משתפגום - She demands partial payment, indicating her intention to claim and settle the debt fully. It implies that her mind is inclined to pursue and collect the debt.
ותזקוף - And upon him is permitted to borrow money since it emerges for her sake, based on the ketubah (marriage contract), and it resembles the practice of a court that does not annul the ketubah, and it applies to a promissory note.
פגמה - Once her intention is evident in pursuing payment, we deem it as not conflicting.
זקפה - Concerning borrowing money.

Line 11



Line 12

אונס - One who seduces a virgin is obligated to pay fifty silver coins.
וקנס - One who spreads a bad name incurs a penalty.
מאימתי נזקפין - From when are they considered as having a subsequent correction? That is, from when does it count as a subsequent correction?
העמדה - Placing it upright is considered a subsequent correction.

Line 13

...The action of a similar court - it is a condition of a court:
What is the action of a court? Its obligations are due to a legal decision, and even though they were not confirmed, therefore there is no preliminary stage, and they are written during the day and signed during the night.
Similarly, a marriage contract - from the time of writing, when it enters the wedding ceremony, it is an effective legal document with obligations, and even though they were not confirmed.

Line 14

Engaged in that matter - From the time of writing until the time of signing, and even in other documents, it is valid.
They did not teach - That documents written during the day and signed at night are invalid.
But engaged in that matter - Since the witnesses are summoned to sign, but the husband must wait until the scribe finishes writing the document, even though the signing is delayed.
It is valid - Because from the time of writing, it also has legal significance.

Line 15

He does not have the rights to the produce (fruits). And if there is a defect from the time of writing, it is considered a defective document.

Line 16



Daf 18b



Line 1

"Shema peis" - He reconciled - He appeased his wife during their argument, and then he had sexual relations with her, making the get (divorce document) invalid due to their renewed intimacy.
"Kala it leya lemilta" - There is room for him regarding the matter - The neighbors, both men and women, hear the conflict and discord between the husband and wife. When they see that their dispute has been resolved and they are peaceful, everyone feels relieved.

Line 2

Rabbi Yochanan said: "Two [witnesses] - they intend to sign [the document] as witnesses."
"And all [other people] - they only sign it out of public embarrassment, and a complete condition is imposed in this get, that it should not be a valid divorce document unless all sign it."
"All [other people sign] as witnesses" - it is intended for their signatures to be [considered as] witnesses.

Line 3

And two (witnesses) sign - and it is difficult for both statements, as they both say that everyone needs to sign:
Rather, (the resolution is) that when they say "all of you" - it means that the divorce document is not valid until all of them sign.

Line 4

What is the difference between them? Whether due to a condition or due to witnesses, all of them need to sign. As we learned in the latter part, that "All of you write a bill of divorce for my wife, one writes and all sign." ...
And within ten days, before they give it to her, all must sign.
...And according to the one who says that due to witnesses it is invalid - because it is not considered complete testimony until they all sign, and since they all did not sign on the day of its writing, it is considered early.

Line 5

If one of them is found to be a relative or invalid - and it is established in the Sanhedrin (page 9) that even if there are a hundred witnesses and one of them is found to be a relative or invalid, their testimony is nullified.

Line 6

If they signed initially, whether a relative or invalid - in the earlier times, the relative would sign first, and then they all would sign on the same day.
It is said that it is valid - according to the one who says it is due to a condition, even though the relative or invalid signed initially, the testimony will still be valid and considered appropriate for testimony, and the relative will be considered as a condition.
It applies to the exchange of documents in general - since once it is signed initially, it can be said with certainty that the relative signed for the purpose of testimony, and the document will be valid, and the relative will validate all the documents.

Line 7

The one who said to ten - "All of you write a get for my wife."

And this stumbling block - meaning, so began the discourse on scripture, it is written "this stumbling block [ruin] under your hand" regarding the men of Jerusalem for whom Torah had ceased, and they were asking their friends "you have a mantle, be our ruler, and this ruin should be under your hand", that is to say, these things that are opaque like your mantle, you that are an expert on them, tell us [what to do] and be a ruler. And this stumbling block are the words of Torah, that a person does not have a firm standing on their truth unless he stumbles on them, to teach mistakes and be humiliated by them, and then one pays attention and understands. Under your hand they are - even I stumbled in my teaching and retracted [what I said].

Daf 54a



Line 1

But they do not count - their plantings by weeks; they do not count the days since planting, but rather the years; therefore, it would not be evident after a long time that he had planted on Shabbat.

Line 2



Line 3

What is "alternatively" - why did he need to bring another reason?
This is what [Rabbi Meir] is saying: And if you would say [people count from] Shabbat, too - sometimes it is necessary to count [that way], as is taught in a Baraita [Rosh Hashana 9b:13] : "If one plants [...] on the eve of the Sabbatical Year thirty days before Rosh HaShana, a year is counted for him"  -- for years [with regard to the prohibition of] orla, since thirty days out of a year are reckoned as a [full] year, "it is permitted to preserve [the plant] during the Sabbatical Year. [However, if one planted] less than thirty days before Rosh HaShana, a year is not counted for him, and it is prohibited to preserve [the new growth] during the Sabbatical Year." Therefore, sometimes the Shabbat on which he planted will be thirty days before Rosh HaShanah, and he can count it as a year; but if he had left out that day [by planting after Shabbat], it would not have sufficed [to constitute] a year. Then, after a while, when people eat of [its] fruit after two years, and say, why are these fruits permitted after [only] two years? He will tell them that the thirty days before Rosh HaShana count as one year, and they will recall that he planted it on Shabbat. Therefore they penalize him.

Line 4

Come and hear that alternatively, Jews are suspected of desecrating the Sabbatical Year - and one can fear that since the matter is recognizable, people will come to permit planting on the Sabbatical Year.
But they are not suspected [of desecrating] Shabbat - and even if it will be recalled and the matter will become known, no one will come to permit planting on Shabbat.


Line 5



Line 6

Dayyar son of a dayyar - a convert son of a convert.


Line 7

Come and hear - that Rabbi Meir does not penalize unintentional transgressions of a rabbinic law.
If one partook of teruma - unintentionally, and even if it was impure.
He pays pure, non-sacred - later [the gemara] will ask, why should he pay with pure produce? One who ate teruma unintentionally does not pay with money, but rather with produce, and does not pay back teruma, but rather non-sacred produce that has been tithed. It is through the payment that they are made to become teruma [automatically], as is stated: "he shall give the priest the sacred donation" [Leviticus 22:14] -- it is through the giving of it that it becomes sacred. Therefore we require [payment with] something that can be endowed with the appellation "teruma" -- not money. But one who eats it intentionally pays money.
Unintentionally - if he payed, unintentionally, not realizing that [the produce] was impure.
His payment is valid - and he is exempt [by paying] with these; they [automatically] become impure teruma, just like what he ate.
Intentionally, his payment is not valid - and later [the gemara] will ask why.
Both in this case and in that case - [that is, both] unintentionally and intentionally.
His payment is valid - and [the produce] becomes teruma and the property of the priest; if he used it to betroth a woman she would be considered betrothed.
He returns and pays with ritually pure, non-sacred produce - as a penalty; [the second payment] does not [automatically] become teruma. 

Line 8

And we discussed, if intentionally, why is his payment not valid? - Why do we penalize him if he made such a payment intentionally? He did not deliberately make an inferior payment.
As he partook of something - impure teruma, which [the priest] cannot eat while he is impure, because one who eats teruma when his body is impure [deserves] death, even if [the teruma] was impure.
And he pays him - impure non-sacred produce, which is fit for [the priest to eat] during the time which he is impure. Even though in the end it will [automatically] become teruma, and will not be fit for him [to eat], since they are after all impure; nevertheless, he intended to repay him with impure non-sacred produce and did not realize that it would [automatically] become teruma.

Line 9

He can pay restitution with anything - any non-sacred produce, whether pure or impure.
Unintentionally, his payment is valid - since one who eats teruma unintentionally repays it by measure and not by monetary value. Even though this teruma [that he is paying with] is worse than what he ate, his payment is valid by Torah law. The Rabbis did not penalize him either, since he unintentionally erred in [his form of] repayment.
Intentionally - where he knew that it was impure.
His payment is not valid - since the Rabbis penalized him, since he intended to cause the priest a loss.

Line 10

And Rav Aḥa, son of Rav Ika, said - in Yevamot in the Chapter "HaIsha Rabbah" [Yevamot 90a:5] as for the one who intentionally [repayed with impure produce], of which Rabbi Meir said that his payment is invalid -- he meant to say that [it is invalid] as far as relieving him of his obligation entirely. That is, he must return and pay with pure non-sacred produce -- just as the Rabbis say. It is [in the case of one who pays with impure produce] unintentionally that he disagrees with the Rabbis; according to Rabbi Meir, we do not penalize the unintentional on account of the intentional. The Rabbis, however, do penalize him. Now, here, we are dealing with a rabbinical prohibition, since by Torah law his payment was valid, since he paid with [an identical] measure. When he paid with impure produce, even intentionally, he violated a rabbinic prohibition -- so Rabbi Meir does not penalize him if he did it unintentionally.


Line 11

He intends to pay - and [so] is an upstanding person.
Should we arise and penalize him - for his unintentional transgression? On the other hand, one who renders [another’s food] ritually impure, or one who mixes [teruma with another’s non-sacred produce] unintentionally is not involved in doing anything positive. 


Line 12

If [he did so] unintentionally, [the offering] is accepted - because the frontplate [of the High Priest] appeases [God for the ritual impurity after the fact] and renders the meat permitted to be eaten.
If [he did so] intentionally, [the offering] is not accepted - by rabbinic law. This is a penalty, which makes the meat forbidden to be eaten. Nevertheless, the owners [of the offering] attain atonement. This sprinkling is forbidden by rabbinic law, since by Torah law one can sprinkle [the blood] ab initio, since the frontplate appeases.

Line 13

Should we arise and penalize him - for his unintentional act? It is also the case that [the gemara] could have answered "whose opinion is it? It is the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda," who does not penalize in [the case of violation of a] rabbinic law, since [the quotation was] not from an unattributed Mishna [which is usually attribute to Rabbi Meir], but rather a baraita in Menachot in the chapter "Hakometz Rabbah" [Menachot 25a]. Nevertheless, [the gemara] preferred to answer "you could even say" that [in such a way that could even be reconciled with the opinion of] Rabbi Meir.
