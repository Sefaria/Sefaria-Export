Daf 11a



Line 1

<b>By those who were invited for that:</b> That the Nasi invited from the eve. 
<b>Bring me up</b> seven [men] tomorrow to the attic that is designated for the court to sit.

Line 2

<b>And I did not ascend to intercalate the year:</b> To join with you now.
<b>But rather to learn</b> from you - how you do [it].
<b>And it was due to embarrassment that he did [it]:</b> So that they would not recognize who ascended without permission and [that man's] face whiten (from embarrassment).

Line 3

<b>Who disturbed father:</b> As you ate the garlic and the smell wafted.
<b>God forbid</b> that I should eat garlic when he comes to his study hall. But it was rather so as not to whiten the face of the one who ate the garlic that I left, so that they would all leave and they would not know who he is. 

Line 4



Line 5

<b>From Shmuel HaKatan:</b> As we have said.
<b>We have broken faith:</b> But he did not marry a foreign woman. So he included himself in order to not whiten their faces. 

Line 6

<b>From Yehoshua:</b> From the story of Yehoshua, such that the Holy One, blessed be He, did not want to reveal to him who the sinner was and included them all, as it is stated, "Israel has sinned." This was in the story of Achan.
<b><i>Diltor</i>:</b> A talebearer.
<b>Do you refuse:</b> They were all included. But behold all of them did not go out to gather, but rather [just] some - as it is written (Exodus 16:27), "some of the people went out to gather, etc."

...Mishna: And these are the ones ineligible -- to be judges or witnesses
one who plays with dice -- All of these people listed are thieves who will become rashas and therefore cannot be witnesses or judges
And merchants who trade in the produce of the Sabbatical Year - since lust after money is a sin from the Torah, he becomes like an evil, violent person, invalid to judge or bear witness, as he inclines after the ill-gotten gain (cf. Exodus 18:21)

Neither one of them [became] a nazirite - Two men were sitting and a man passed by.  One said, “What’s-his-name who just passed is a nazirite!” and the other said “He’s not a nazirite! If he turns out to be a nazirite, I’m a nazirite!”  His fellow said, “If he turns out not to be a nazirite, I’m a nazirite!”  Both of them intended to take nazirite vows in the same way as one of them [intended to do so--which is to say, not at all]. Rabbi Tarfon said neither of them [became] a nazirite because his words were in jest and that is not a solemn vow; a person must make a solemn vow [to become a nazirite].  He [Rabbi Yehuda]  is explaining Rabbi Tarfon’s reasoning; that is to say, he’s laying it out even though [the opinion] is not his.  Even so, it is an asmachta [insincere and non-binding exchange] and they have not said enough for it to result in a legal acquisition.

Of Bayah the tax-collector - It once happened that Jewish tax-farmer, evil, and a great scholar died on the same day and in the same place. All the people assembled to attend the burial of the great scholar; at the same time the relatives of the tax-farmer brought his bier for burial. Enemies attacked the group, so they all dropped both biers and ran. One student however stayed there guarding the body of his rabbi. Some time later the town dignitaries returned to resume the burial of the great scholar, but the biers of the rabbi and the tax-farmer somehow got exchanged and the protests of the student were of no avail. So the relatives of the tax-farmer buried the great rabbi, which greatly distressed the student; nor could he explain to himself what great sin had caused the one to be buried in such a shameful way and what great merit in the other had brought about his interment with such honor. His rabbi appeared to him in a dream and told him not to be distressed. "Come and let me show you how greatly I am honored in paradise and let me also show you that man in hell with the hinges of the gates of hell turning through his ears. Once I heard people calumniating the sages and did not protest (and that is why I was punished); he once prepared a banquet in honor of a city dignitary who did not show up, and he distributed the food to the poor (and that is why he was rewarded)." The student asked how long the poor man was doomed to suffer such difficult judgment. "Until Shimeon ben Shatach dies," was the reply, "who will then replace him!" "Why?" asked the student; "Because there are Jewish women in Ashkelon who practice witchcraft and he does not subject them to judgment." The following day the student related his dream to Shimeon ben Shatach. The latter assembled eighty tall young men and distributed to each of them a jar with a cloak wrapped up inside (it was a rainy day). He also told them to make sure that they were always eighty in number. "When you come inside," he said, "one of you must raise his jar from the ground; from that moment the witches will have no further hold over you; if that does not work then we can never beat them." Shimeon ben Shatach went into the witches' hall and left the young men outside. When the witches asked him who he was he replied that he was a wizard who had come to test them with his wizardry. "What tricks can you do?" they asked. "Despite the fact that it is raining today I can produce eighty young men with dry talitot!" "Show us!" He went outside and beckoned the young men inside. They removed the talitot from the jars, put them on, and came in. They took each man one witch and carried them, and were able to defeat them, and hung them all up. The relatives of the witches were incensed. Two of them came forward and perjured themselves by testifying that Shimeon ben-Shatach's son had committed some crime that was punishable by death. He was condemned to death. As he was being taken out to be stoned he said, "If I am guilty of this crime may my death bring me atonement, and if I am innocent may it atone for all my other sins and the responsibility for my death will be on the shoulders of the witnesses." When the perjurers heard this they recanted their testimony and explained that they had only acted because of their animosity at the fate of their women-folk, and so he wasn't killed.

Rav Ashi says - decomposition of the flesh is not needed, rather a little of the affliction of the beatings of the grave. The reason is because they don't mourn because mourning takes effect when the grave is sealed as is explained in perek 'alu megalchin' (moed katan 3).

Daf 68a



Line 1

<b>But behold:</b> The matter of the gathering of cucumbers.
<b>Rabbi Akiva learned it from Rabbi Yehoshua:</b> By way of a question.
 <b><i>Kinuf</i>:</b> Four posts and a canopy draped over them, as we say in Sukkah (10a).

Line 2

<b>To remove the tefillin</b> of his father. As he held that Shabbat is not a time for tefillin. So it is [hence] forbidden to wear them, lest he go out with them to the public domain. 
<b>That father went insane:</b> And he is close to death. As if his mind was composed, he would have removed his tefillin.
<b>A prohibition [punishable by] stoning</b> - the lighting of a lamp and the insulation of hot water - whereas they are dealing with a matter that is only a rabbinic Shabbat prohibition. For there is no prohibition of work (<i>melakha</i>) in placing tefillin [on oneself] on Shabbat, and even if he went out with them into the public domain. As it is in the way of clothing, and it is an ornament for him on weekdays. 

Line 3

<b>At a distance of four cubits:</b> Because of the excommunication; for they excommunicated him during the disagreement about Akhnai's oven in Bava Metzia (59b).


Line 4

<b>What is his:</b> With what will be his death?
<b>Yours will be worse than theirs:</b> Because your heart is as wide as a hall; so if you had served me, you would have learned much Torah.


Line 5

<b>He raised:</b> Rabbi Eliezer [raised] his two forearms. 
<b>That are being rolled up:</b> Just like when a Torah scroll is being rolled up and the writing is concealed, so too is the Torah in my heart being hidden and concealed as I die. For they did not serve me and learn from me.
<b>And I have not taken away from my teachers, even like a dog lapping from the sea:</b> According to their wisdom, which was great, my learning only counts as having taken away and received a little wisdom from them, like a dog who laps from the sea. And likewise have my students not even taken away and received from my wisdom, to take away from the surplus of my wisdom over theirs, that which a paintbrush removes from a tube in one dip.
<b>And I have not taken away:</b> Meaning to say, I have not removed from their wisdom - such that they were greater than me at the beginning; and they are greater than me also now. For I only learned a little of their wisdom from them.
<b>A tube (<i>shifoferet</i>):</b> A tube into which one inserts blue dye. It is a cylinder of wood or of silver into which we stick a brush and dip into the blue dye and extract it.

Line 6

<b>With regard to a snow-white leprous mark:</b> With regard to the laws of the sightings of blemishes (<i>negaim</i>).
<b>With regard to the planting of cucumbers:</b> The laws of types of sorcery, through which a whole field is made full of cucumbers. 

Line 7



Line 8

<b>They said to him, "A ball and a last, etc.":</b> A ball is a <i>pelote</i> covered with leather and tightly stuffed with ram's wool inside it. And likewise their leather last was like a type of shoe filled with hair inside it, with its opening sewn [shut]. And they would make shoes on it, the way our cobblers do with a wooden mold.
<b>An amulet:</b> It is of leather, filled inside and one carries it on the neck for beauty.
<b>A small weight:</b> Like an ounce-weight that we make from lead and cover with leather, so that it not lessen (from wear). But it is not customary to cover a large weight with leather.
<b>And a string of a pearl:</b> We sew the pearl with leather and hang it on the neck of an animal for medication.
<b>What is it (its law):</b> For Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages disagreed about these in the Order of Tahorot (Kelim 23). And the Sages say [that] they cannot contract impurity, since a leather vessel cannot contract impurity unless it has a receptacle. For behold it is compared to sack. And these [items] - since their receptacle is made to fill permanently with a filling inside it - [are] not called a receptacle. But Rabbi Eliezer says [that] it does contract impurity, as a receptacle made to be filled is [still] called a receptacle. And they also disagreed about a ball and a last that tear and their hollow is visible: For the Rabbis conceded that they can contract impurity, as behold there is [now] a receptacle. But they argued about the matter of immersion. As the Sages say [that] what is inside separates [it from the purifying water], but Rabbi Eliezer says [that] what is inside does not separate, as it is all one vessel. And at the time of his death, they wanted to know if he reversed himself. So they asked him, "What do you say about those two disagreements?" He said to them [that] they are impure even intact and the impurity touches [them] from the outside.   
<b>And their purification is as they are:</b> That is to say if they tear - such that the Sages concede that they can contract impurity, but argue with me, saying that the filling separates - I stand by my words that the filling does not separate, so that we immerse them as they are. 

Line 9

<b>What is [the law with a] shoe that is on a last:</b> As they also argued about this in the Tosefta of Tahorot: The Sages say [that] since it is not lacking work that requires a craftsman - since an ordinary person can remove it from the last - it is already called a vessel. But Rabbi Eliezer renders it pure, since its work has not yet been finished [so it is not yet a vessel].
<b>The vow is permitted:</b> Since they had excommunicated him.


Line 10

<b>Between Caesarea and Lod:</b> As they were carrying his bier from Caesarea to Lod.
<b>He began in the row:</b> As they were making a row around the bier to eulogize [him]. 
<b>I have many coins</b> to exchange.
<b>But I do not have a money changer to sort them:</b> Meaning to say, I have many questions to ask, but there is no one to ask.

Line 11



Line 12


R' Eliezer did the sorcery so R' Akiva could study their performance to prosecute sorcerers.

Line 4

Do you [really] think that a wayward and rebellious son, on account of his sin, is executed - [a punishment normally given to someone] who we would require to be subject to the laws of punishment? Can it really be that he will be executed for his sin, on account of the fact that he ate a tarteimar [~ three ounces; Jastrow] of meat and drank half of a log [volume of six eggs; Frank] of wine [Rather,] as a result of his [eventual] outcome he is executed, as explained at the end of our chapter (page 72a): "...at the end, when he will [eventually] deplete his father's wealth, and will seek to maintain his [gluttonous] habit, but doesn't find [the means to do so]..." et cetera "...the Torah stated: better that he die [while still] innocent and not die [later while] guilty [of a capital crime].

<b>its head came out:</b> With a women that is experiencing difficulty giving birth and is in [mortal] danger. And it is taught in the first section [of this teaching], "the midwife extends her hand and cuts it up and extracts [the pieces];" as the entire time that that it has not gone out into the air of the world, it is not [considered] a soul, and [so] it is possible to kill it and to save its mother. But when its head came out, we cannot touch it to kill it, as it is like a born [baby]; and we do not push off one soul for the sake of another. And if you will ask [from] the story of Sheva ben Bichri - [wherein it is written] (II Samuel 20:21), "behold, his head is sent to you" - they pushed off one life for the sake of another; there, it was because even if they had not delivered him, he would have been killed in the city when Yoav would have seized it, and they would have been killed with him. But if he would have [otherwise] been saved - even though they would have been killed - they would not have been allowed to deliver him [to Yoav] in order to save themselves. And also (another answer) is that it is because he was a rebel to the kingdom, and so is it explained in the Tosefta (of Terumah).

Crushed in the building - of the Egyptians, who put him into the building in the place of a brick as is explained in the aggadah. Moshe said to the Holy One 'You have done evil to this people! Now if they don't have bricks they place the children of Israel into the building!' The Holy One replied to him, 'They are wiping out the thorns, because it is revealed before Me that if these children lived they would be completely wicked. If you want, make a test and remove one.' Moshe went and removed Micah.
