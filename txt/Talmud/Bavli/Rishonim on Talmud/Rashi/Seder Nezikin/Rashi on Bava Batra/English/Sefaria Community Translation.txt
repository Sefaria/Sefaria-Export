Daf 2a

Line 3



Line 4



Line 5



Line 6

<b><i>Guda</i>:</b> A wall.
<b>As it was taught (in the mishnah) [in a baraita]:</b> Since the tanna (teacher) called a wall, <i>mechitzah</i>.
<b><i>Mechitzat</i> (A partition of) a vineyard:</b> That is next to his fellow's cultivated field [of grain].
<b>He may say to him:</b> To the owner of the vineyard, "You must build a fence, so that your vines do not prohibit the produce of the field, on account of forbidden mixtures." For the owner of the field [planted] his seeds adjacent to the fence, as we learned (in the mishnah, Bava Batra 26a), "If there was a fence between them, this one may place his trees close to the fence from here, and that one may place his produce close to the fence from there." But when there is no fence there, we learned in the second chapter [as well], "A person may not plant a tree near the field of another unless he distances it four ells" - enough for the work of the vineyard. As [otherwise] it is [a case of] forbidden mixtures. 
<b>If it was breached again, he may say to him:</b> To make a partition.

Daf 2b



Line 1

<b>Rendered forbidden (<i>kidesh</i>):</b> The produce, if it increased by a two hundredth. It [used] the language of Scripture (Deuteronomy 22:9), "lest it be rendered forbidden (<i>tikdash</i>)."

Line 2

<b>The reason is that they wanted:</b> To build the wall - as it was the will of both of them - that is when the Sages obligated both of them to build [it]. And later, it challenges, "When they wanted? What [does it matter], let them retract it?" However if the two of them did not want it - such that one said, "It is enough to divide it with a bordermark of low wooden pegs planted into the ground" - we do not force him. And the other one may not [force the other and] say to him, "I do not want you to see my business."

Line 3

<b>A division:</b> The splitting of a courtyard, such that they were in agreement about the splitting. And it is when there is not enough [room] for there to be eight ells for this one and for that one, such that one may not force his fellow to split it. And for this [reason], it taught that [it is if they wanted] - that since they want to split it, they build a wall of stones [even] against their will. And if one comes to say, "I do not want this expense, but rather [only] a mere bordermark," we do not listen to him, because of damage to visual privacy.

Line 4

<b>I would say that a mere bordermark:</b> [That this] is what the mishnah is discussing. As it too is called a partition. And that which it taught, "who wished," is about the splitting; and it is when it is not subject to the law of division - it teaches us [it must be] a wall; and that which it taught, "who wished," is about the wall. As if they did not want [to split it with a wall], let them split it with a bordermark.

Line 5



Line 6

<b>Where one of them convinced his fellow:</b> He requested from him, the division with a barrier.
<b>Lest you say [that] he can say, "When I was persuaded by you</b> about the barrier, I was persuaded about a thin barrier - such as one of boards, since it is thin - and to reduce the airspace;  and [that is enough, since] with it, there is no damage to visual privacy. Otherwise, pull the width of the wall into your portion, except for a small [space]. But I was not persuaded to build a thick wall of stones to also reduce my usage [of the courtyard's space]."  

Line 7



Line 8



Line 9

<b>It is prohibited for a person to stand, etc.:</b> That he not damage it with an evil eye.

Line 10

<b>But behold, it teaches, "And similarly":</b> Such that it is implied that both of them have one reason, the garden and the courtyard. 

Line 11

<b>We obligate him:</b> And here it was not taught, "They wished," but it is rather [even] against his will.
<b>Fell is different:</b> As the first [owners] already consented to the wall.

Line 12

<b>And he who asked it, why did he ask it:</b> And did he not know that fell is different?
<b>It was necessary [to teach] the latter clause:</b> Meaning to say, the law is also the same from the start (before it fell). So that which it taught, "If it fell," is because the latter clause makes us understand that we do not obligate [him to rebuild] more than four ells. And even though the first [wall] was higher, we do not obligate him.

Line 13

<b>We compel him:</b> [We compel] every resident of the courtyard to give his share to the construction.
<b>A gatehouse:</b> Since we build a wall in front of the gate [that is] curved all around. And in that circumference, we make a small entrance on the side, on account of [preventing] damage from the vision of people in the public domain, such that they not see into the courtyard.
<b>Damage of the public:</b> Since all the people in the public domain stare there. 

Line 14

<b>We do not divide:</b> One may not compel his fellow to divide.

Line 15

<b>The windows:</b> One of those sharing the courtyard who builds a wall in the courtyard opposite the windows of his fellow, whether above, etc. - if the wall is higher than the windows, he must raise [it] four ells above them, as it continues to explain: So that he will not support himself on his wall and bow down and see into his fellow's windows.
<b>Whether below:</b> If the wall is lower than the windows, he must lower if four ells from them so that he not stand on the width of his wall and see.
<b>Or opposite them:</b> He must distance the wall four ells from the windows so that it will not darken [the interior of his fellow's house].

Line 16

<b>Damage of a house is different:</b> As a person does private things in his house.

Line 17

<b>A parapet four ells high:</b> So that he will not look into the courtyard of his fellow when he uses his roof.
<b>But I do not know when you will go up:</b> To use your roof.

Daf 3a



Line 1

<b>So that I can hide from you:</b> Private matters. But a courtyard divided by the two of them is fixed for the use of each one in his section at all times; so they do not do private matters in it.

Line 2

<b>Since they wished</b> to divide [it]. But later it challenges, "Why was he speaking about, 'If they wished?' Even if they did not [both] wish," they can compel one another. 
<b>They build a wall</b> of stones.

Line 3

<b>A wall:</b> A wall of stones. And this is in a courtyard subject to the law of division; so they split it [even] against their will. 

Line 4

<b>The reason is that they wished:</b> And they stipulated that it be divided with a wall of stones. Behold, if they did not wish [it], they only obligate him with a mere bordermark. 

Line 5

<b>As people say, etc.:</b> This is a resolution (an answer).                 

Line 6

<b>Is not subject to the law of division:</b> [As it does not consist of] at least eight ells. [So] they do not divide it.

Line 7



Line 8

<b>And sacred writings:</b> A Torah scroll which is in one town. And likewise, Prophets and Writings that are written on parchment like a Torah scroll.

Line 8

<i>who prophecied in that period</i> – In the days of those kings — Uziah, Yotam, Aḥaz, and Yeḥizkiyah, these four prophetic books were written, with the exception of Micah, which was not in the days of Uziah but was just in the days of Yotam, Aḥaz, and Yeḥizkiyah.

Line 9

<i> Ḥaggai Zekhariah and Malakhi were the end of the prophets </i> – for they were in the  Second Temple, in the second year of the Darius the Last.

Line 10

<i> Yeshaya preceded Yirmiyah and Yeḥezkel </i> – for look, Yeshaya was in the days of Uziah, and Yirmiyah was in the days of Yoshiya and his sons prophecying in Jerusalem, and Yeḥezkel was in exile in the days of Ẓedekiyah.

Line 11

<i> Ruth, Psalms, Job etc </i> – Ruth was first, in the "days the judges judged" (Ruth 1:1). Psalms David said, and he was before Job according to the one who says it was in the days of the Queen of Sheba, and that was after the three books of Shlomo.
<i> Proverbs, Ecclesiastes </i> – the two are wisdom books.
<i> Song of Songs </i> – it seems to me that it was said at the time of his old age.
<i> Lamentations </i> – Yirmiyah said them, and he was after Shlomo.
<i> Daniel </i> – after Yirmiyah, in the days of Nebuchadnezzar in exile.
<i> Esther </i> – after that, in the days of Aḥashverosh.
<i> Ezra </i> after that, in the days of Darius II who arose after Aḥashverosh.
<i> according to the one who says Job was in the days of Moses </i> – see below.
<i> Ruth is also about suffering </i> – famine and exile and the death of Elimelekh and his sons.
<i> which has a future </i> – in the end, the suffering turns to hope, for David comes from there.

Line 12

<i> And the passage of Bilaam </i> – His prophecies and parables, although they were not his. Moses and his Torah used them with the order of his deeds.
<i> and eight verses </i> – From "And Moses died" (Deut. 34:5) to the end of the book.
<i> Shmuel wrote his book and the book of Judges </i> – For they came before him, and he rose and wrote their book, and what happened to Israel in their days, and also Ruth because it was in the days of the judges.
<i> by hand of ten elders </i> – He wrote in it things that these elders had said who were before him, and some were in his days like Asaph and Heiman and Yedutun of the Levite singers.
<i> by the hand of First Adam </i> — such as, "My unformed body Your eyes saw... how weighty Your purpose is to me" (Psalm 139) — First Adam wrote it.
<i> by the hand of Malki-Ẓedek </i> – "Said the LORD to my lord, [sit at my right hand]" and all that psalm (Psalm 110).
<i> and by the hand of Avraham </i> – as we have said above, Eitan the Ezraḥite is Avraham.
<i> and by the hand of Moshe </i> – "A prayer of Moshe" (Psalm 90) and all the eleven psalms in its order (Psalm 90 – 100).
<i> and by Heiman </i> "A maskil of Heiman" (Psalm 88)
<i> and by Yedutun </i> "For the leader, of Yedutun" (Psalm 77)

Daf 15a



Line 1



Line 2

<i> Ḥizkiyah and his faction </i> – the children of his generation whose days after him were extended.
<i> wrote Isaiah </i> – who Menashe murdered, and thus he did not write his own book, for none of the prophets would write their books until before their deaths.
<i> Proverbs and Ecclesiastes </i> – as it is written in the Book of Proverbs (Prov. 25:1) "which Ḥizkiyah's men copied" etc - for Ḥizkiyah made them study Torah as it is written in the section (B. Sanhedrin 94b) "He inserted a sword at the entrance of the study hall... etc" so they called the matter after his name.
<i> The men of the Great Assembly </i> —Ḥaggai, Zekharya, Malakhi, Zerubavel, and Mordekhai and their comrades.
<i> they wrote Yeḥezkel </i> — for he prophecied in exile. And I do not know why Yeḥezkel didn't wrote it himself, if not because prophecy is not allowed to be written outside of the Land, so they wrote them after they came to the land. And thus the book of Daniel, which was in exile, and thus the Scroll of Esther and the Twelve of whose prophecies were minor — the prophets did not write it together, but rather each wrote their own book, and Ḥaggai, Zekharya, and Malakhi came and saw that the Holy Spirit was withdrawing, that they were the last prophets, and they arose and wrote their prophecies and attached the minor prophecies with them, and made them a great big that would not be lost because of their small size.
<i> until his </i> – until his own genealogy.

Line 3

<i> This accords with... ...until he established his genealogy </i> – that he wrote Chronicles until he established his genealogy.
<i> And who finished it </i> – and who finished it <small>Rashi translates the Aramaic into Hebrew here.</small>

Line 1

Bloodletters - Those who draw blood (for medicinal purposes)
Crows - (This refers to) crows as their cry onomatopoeically is kurkur  
Remove for me - That means to say that do not to continue to blood let for me here because this causes the crows to come 

Line 2

With smoke - smoke 
With a bathroom - At ground level, that is clearly visible, for this was where their bathrooms were (placed) 

Line 3

Mishna: One must distance a dovecote from the city - Because the doves diminish (the) seeds of vegetable gardens
Unless he has etc. - That the doves should not cause the neighbours field to be diminished
As far as the dove flies [is sent] - The span of a single flight
And if he bought it - As is, together with land, even if the surrounding (land) is (only) an area [that produces] a quarter of a kav, the rights (to keep it) remain, because the original owner established that right  

Line 4

Gemara: One does not spread nets - So that one should not ensnare the (local) domesticated doves

One should not spread - traps
A settled area of vineyards - Because they fly from vineyard to vineyard and fly (cover) great (distances)

Line 1

MISHNA: House of Throwing (irrigated): Because of the water spring in [the field,] it is watered from [the spring] continuously (and) it makes fruits continuously, and all thing that does fruits continuously their חזקת (presumption of ownership, power over, hold) is 3 years from one day to the next, if the presumed has 3 complete years he does not need to bring a שטר of purchase, and if a complaint against him is raised by the first owners and this one says "I bought it and lost my שטר of purchase," his חזקה works for him, and without it his חזקה, it doesn't work, due to the fact that when they said "three years for a חזקה," they meant to say that all that is proper to take out from the use of the land during three years is what they meant. (Basically, whatever would be equivalent to three years of produce).

Line 2

Field of the house owner - Nourished from rain water, it doesn't make fruits except one time in a year, his chazaka is 3 years and (it does) not need to be from day to day. And what is its Chazaka? Rabbi Ishmael says last three months of the first year and three first months of the last year and a complete middle (year), that (because) there is the hurry to plant before the the new year, and since the chazaka comes (at)three months at the end of the first year and he has witnesses that he planted in those three months and also in the first three months of the last (year), behold this is chazaka of three continious years, that (because) there isn't for you, a man who sees that his friend plants his field (so as) to eat the fruit made (grown) for the year and stays quiet.

Line 3



Line 4

Rabbi Akiva says etc. - Explains the Gemara in what they argue.

Line 5

In what is this statment - that 18 months is needed for the field of the house owner.
In the white field - That all its fruits are collected at once, therefore 3 years is needed.
But in a field of the trees - that their fruit is collected in parts, grapes in one part, and olives in another part, and figs in another part.
Brings in his crop - (Bring in the) wine of the vine.
And cuts (harvests) his olives and gathers in his dried figs - figs plucked and dried in it (in the field), and spread out (for the sun) and brought in to the house. Behold this is Chazaka like if it has been three years.

Line 6

Gemara: From Travelers to Usha: That the exhiled Sanhedrin (court) (went) to Usha, like it was stated in Rosh Hashana (Page 31a), Ten exhiles, exhiled was the Sanhedrin... from Yavne To Usha from Usha...

Line 7

Not liable - to pay but half the damage, also here until the end of the fourth year it will not be chazaka.

Daf 28b



Line 1

And the other - Like saying (meaning): and the fourth goring we need, meaning that because without goring after the chazaka (was placed) what (is there) to pay.

Line 2

That is not accompanied by a claim - Explained in the Mishna later (Bava Batra page 41a), says to him "what are you doing within mine (in my property)", (the trespasser) says to him that "Nobody ever told me anything (about me using your property)", and does not say to him, "you sold it to me".
Should be chazaka - That is (since) you said that three years takes out from him, from the dominion of the seller. (without any need of claiming legal ownership)

Line 3

And (the gemara) answers: What is the reason? - We say three years takes it out from the Chazaka of the first master (owner), we say: perhaps like he (the possessor) said. (Example:) this one says "I acquired it from you" and this one says "you stole it from me", and we don't know with who is the truth. Comes (the) chazaka of three years and it establishes it in(as) his (the possessor) property, and we say perhaps it truly is like he (the possessor) said (that he acquired it). But without an argument (of the possessor, such as "I aquired it"): from where did he aquire so as to eat for three years? (we can can ask what right has he to be there).

Line 4

A protest not in his pressence (of the possesor) should not be (considered) a protest - If the accuser protests within three years in the pressence of witnesses that (was) not in the pressence of the possesor and he says know that such person is holding my land through theft, it would (should) not be (considered) a protest.
Similar to the warned bull - That we testified that his bull gored and the three times that they testified weren't in his pressence (the owner's), he is not made (placed in the status of being called) warned. Also, warning (in front of) witnesses of 'protest' would not be (called) witnessed, (since) it wasn't in his pressence (of the holder), the protest will be similar to the warning (of the bull). That is (the protest before witnesses only works as a) warning to guard his bull, and also the protest (of the occupancy) is a warning to be careful in (being able to) proving his merit (to be there) and his purchase document.

Line 5

There, "And Warning in his owner (he has already been warned with witnesses)" said the merciful-one (as written in the Torah)... - As if meaning to say: (they are) not similar (the case of the bull to that of property) even though we learned three years from three gorings, just as we remove these from (their) chazaka also these we take out from (their) chazaka. But (in regards to the subject of) claims (of property) from warning (of the bull) we don't have  (a way to) learn it (no comparisson), that there, since from warning (with witnesses is what obligates him to pay) money over his gorings it is, she (the warning is what) comes and establishes his bull in the Chazaka of '(fore)warned'.  We need (this warning to be) in front (of the) owners (so that they) will know (to have a chance) to argue and contradict the witnesses and (have a chance) to bring others (so as) to (testify against these initial witnesses so that they wil become) false (witnesses). But (the) reason for the claim (over the property is so that) he be cautioned to be careful with (proving) his merit (to be there) is (the reason) that she (the warning) comes, that this (warning) claims that through stealing, she (the property) is in his hands (so he should be careful), (therefore) here (in our case) even though that (the claim was) not infront of him it also is (a valid claim, since he is already in an instant possition to lose his property).
Of your friend a friend he has... - And was said this (one) to this (one), and the matter comes to his ear and (it is) not possible (for him to defend himself) to say "had I heard I would have been careful in proving (with a document) my merit (to possess the land)" (since we assume he heard the complaint of the previous owner)

Line 6

And rabbi meir that says... - This means to say for Rabbi Yehuda that says in Bava Kamma: which one (is) warned? All that (has) testimony upon him three (different) days, there is to say here three years is similar to three days. But for rabbi meir that says, the innocent (bull), even if (he) gored three times in one day becomes 'warned', a priori here (where) he also ate three fruits in one day; for example, fig that (does) not mature together (at the same time), and there are (some that) aren't mature in the morning and by evening they are proper (mature), here too it should be chazaka! (The gemara) answers: similar to the warned bull... (for example the figs already existed but were not proper yet while the additional gorings do not exist at all)

Line 7



Line 8

caper bush - a fruit that is not recognizeable (can't be seen) today and  finishes (maturing) at the end of three days. 

Line 9

Alfalfa - Type of seed it is, to (make) herb (for) farm animals, and at the end of 30 days it finishes (fully growing) and (a person) uproots it, and plant another in (its) place. And within (those) 30 days (it would be ready to) cut it three times (a month for use as continious feed). 
Dekadaich - Grow a little.
To cut it (the fruit) [while tender] (and again) cut it and eat - And this is not food of the whole fruit (not mature).

Line 10

Three moons - That uprooted at the end of every month and planted another.
Who (are those that) went (to) Usha? - That said Rabbi Yochanan above for this subject in their name.
Rabbi Yishamel - Not Explained to me from where, rather so (they) learned that he was in the same time (as those in Usha).

Line 11



Line 12

For Rabanan what? - Rabanan, they don't have this of rabbi Yishamel (to learn chazaka from the bull), from where (do) they (learn that) Chazaka (is) of 3 years?

Line 13

So we version (See Tosfos): Behold a prophet stood in the ten and warns over (the) eleven - Yirmiah (the prophet) in the tenth (year) of (king) Tzdekiahu and was imprisoned in the field (called)  Hametara, as written in the book of Yirmiah: "and there was said to him "here Chanamel son of Shalom etc..." And written in that subject, "Fields with money buy and write in the book etc..."  (He) was warning (to the) buyers of fields to write a document and witnesses to witness with their signatures, for (you will be) exhiled from the city in the year eleven when captured the city, and will not (be able to) do chazaka in purchase (by using it for) three years, rather (only the) tenth and eleventh. therefore in those 2 years it will not be (grounds for making) chazaka. From here (we learn) for chazaka that it isn't less than three years.

Line 14

Advice (that is) good comes to teach us - Meaning to say, always chazaka is (/works) in one year and (the following) good advice it comes to teach us: that (he) should (keep) his document in his hand ready to prove (his ownership) and no need for witnesses (that he was there for a year)  when a complaint (is raised) about him (when he comes back from the exhile).

Daf 29a



Line 1

That if (you) don't say so - Behold, sent Yirmiah to them that were in Bavel -- (those) that (were) exhiled with (king) Yechaniah eleven years before (the) exhile (of) Tzdekiahu --  "Build homes and settle because you will not leave from there until filled(/pass) for Bavel seventy years." Why for him to warn about this? Rather advice that is good it comes to teach that he is giving them. Here also (in the subject of making a document) good advice (it) simply is.
Know - He would exhert all (of) himself to advise good advice, that he also said to them (to) store their documents (in a) place where they will (be) upkept more (longer).
