Rashi on Avodah Zarah



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

Before the festivals of the idolaters 3 days it is forbidden to do business with them - and all of this is because he will go and thank his idol on the day of his festival: "borrowing" (sheilah) [refers to] things that need to be returned, like animals and vessels, as it is written (shemos 22:13) "when a man borrows from his neighbor..." "borrowing" (malveh) [refers to] things that don't need to be returned, like money, as it is written (ibid) "if you lend [someone from] my nation money" because malveh is when [money] is given to spend and he (the borrower) pays him (the lender) with other money
he's happy for another time - for tomorrow

<b><i>Kelaneya</i>:</b> Free, such that it not give taxes ever. It was since it had rabbis in it, and Antoninus himself served before Rebbe, as per the below. And because of that, he was a friend of the rabbis.
 <b>Rabbi brought a man, placed him, etc.:</b> That is to say, place your son over them and over you, and Tiberias will be be given into his hands.
<b>And tell him,</b> to your son, that he should let the dove fly from his hands. That is to say, that he should make Tiberias a free city, to release it from his yoke.

Line 15



Daf 10b



Line 1

<b>But let him say [it] to him</b> publicly.
<b>Perhaps they will cause him anguish,</b> to Rabbi. 

Line 2

<b>Performed a prohibited action:</b> She had illicit intercourse.
<b>He sent him,</b> Antoninus to Rabbi, an herb, the name of which was <i>gargira</i>; <i>orugue</i> in [Old French]. And Rabbi understood: What do I have to do with this herb? It is certainly a sign (message) that he sent me. <i>Gargira</i> is that the heart of Gira was dragged (<i>negrara</i>) and drawn in with the adulterers. He knew how to study [the message from] Antoninus.
<b>He sent him:</b> Rabbi [sent] coriander (<i>kusbarta</i>); <i>aillendre</i> in [Old French]. That is to say, slaughter the daughter - <i>kos barta</i> (which means, kill daughter) - it is two words.
<b>He sent him again:</b> Antoninus [sent] leeks (<i>karti</i>); <i>porels</i> in [Old French]. That is to say, if so, my offspring will be cut off (<i>yikaret</i>).
<b>He sent him again, lettuce (<i>chasa</i>):</b> <i>Laitugue</i> in [Old French]. That is to say, have pity (<i>chus</i>) on her.

Line 3

<b><i>Matrata</i>:</b> Leather saddlebags, like big sacks.
<b>With wheat in the opening of the sacks:</b> As if they open the sacks, they will see wheat and they will not understand [its actual contents].
 <b>And those who come from them will bring forth to them:</b> Those that come from among you will pay expenses (taxes) to the kings of Rome that will arise after me, relying upon that money.

Line 4

<b><i>Nekarta</i>:</b> A cave. It is [related to] the expression, <i>nikrat hatzur</i> (the cleft of the rock, Exodus 33:22).
<b>To Rabbi's house:</b> To study Torah.

And he said [to himself], "By your life, In the end you will concede to their words." And [so] he commanded one of his students to test her with a matter of sin. And [that student] pleaded with her many days until she agreed. And when she found out, she strangled herself. And [so] Rabbi Meir ran away due to embarrassment.

Line 1

Mishnah. A vat [for wine-pressing] made of stone that a heathen [sealed with] tar: it was customary to lift a small amount of wine into it [i.e. the vat] to overcome the smell of the tar.
To scour it: [This is] explained in the gemara [as scouring using] water and ashes.
Of wood: which requires more tar since it absorbs more wine [i.e. than a stone vat]. Rabbi says scour it as with the stone [vat] and the Sages disagree.
And of earthenware, even if the tar is peeled off, it is forbidden: one might think every opinion holds this way since earthenware itself without tar absorbs wine.

Line 2

Gemara. But if he trampled [grapes] in it [i.e. the vat]: without tarring, scouring is not necessary, rather rinsing [is sufficient].
He taught the customary case: because it is the custom of the tar-sealers to throw wine into it [i.e. the vat].

Line 3

Others say, Raba says only when tarred: [if the vat is tarred, but] he did not trample [grapes] in it, this is the case in which scouring is sufficient. 

Cleansing it is not sufficient - rather, peeling [off the pitch entirely is necessary] because wine may enter the cracks in the pitch.

Line 4


Shi'ah - Smooth.

Line 4

And they do not disagree. Rav and Shmuel [do not disagree], according to the language of Pumbedita, except that Rav does not count the final [rinsing with] water, and Shmuel does count the final [rinsing with] water. And there are those who explain that "they do not disagree" refers to Sura and Pumbedita, except that Sura does not count the final [rinsing with] water and that Pumbedita does count [the final rinsing]; but, Rav and Shmuel disagree. And this is the meaning of the words "two, three": Two [steps are necessary] for a dry [vat]: water and ash; three for a moist [vat]: ash and water and ash. And Shmuel says three for a moist [vat] as stated, but for a dry [vat], four: water and ash, water and ash; in all cases, [Shmuel] requires ash twice. And in Pumbedita it was taught that Rav [required] three and four [steps]: For a dry [vat], three: water and ash [and] water. And we also have this in Sura, except these [i.e. the Pumbedita prescriptions] count final water [for rinsing]. And for a moist [vat], four [steps are required]: ash and water, ash and water; and according to Shmuel, for a moist [vat], four [steps are required] as stated, but for a dry [vat] five [steps are required]: water and ash, and water and ash, and water, such that a dry [vat] also requires ash twice. "And they do not disagree refers to Sura and Pumbedita, etc." But, Rav and Shmuel disagree regarding a dry [vat] both in Sura and in Pumbedita in that Rav only requires ash once and Shmuel requires [ash] twice. This is reading of my father, my teacher, may he rest in peace, and this seems to me [to be the correct reading]. The first reading [is that of] my teacher, and it is difficult for me since in the language of Sura, Rav and Shmuel certainly disagree. What is the difference [of opinion]? Rav counts final [rinsing] water and Shmuel does not count final [rinsing] water. For Shmuel, [the] four and five [counting] requires that we teach [that Shmuel is counting the final rinsing water]. This is reasonable according to Pumbedita even though Rav does not count [the final rinsing water] and Shmuel does count [it]. This is convenient because the disagreement between Rav and Shmuel is not substantive, [it is] only [a disparity] in the counting of the final [rinsing] water. But, according to the language of Sura, there is still a disagreement [between Rav and Shmuel], which is difficult for me.

Line 5

Gurgei - [wicker-net] bales, in La'az "ributi," [which] are wrapped around the "tapuach" [i.e. heap of grape pulp] so that the grapes do not scatter because of the weight of the beam [which is used to press them]. And Rav Hai [Gaon] commented [that] "akalim" as taught here are like "a bale ["ekel"] [used for] an olive press" (Sanhedrin 26a), made as a type of basket weaved into a net. After squeezing the olives the "gefet" [i.e. peat made of olive peals] is placed in that "ekel" [i.e. wicker-net] and [one] presses it [with a beam] and because of the weight [being applied] the remaining drink is drawn [from the peat made of olive peals]. These are "gurgei d'Armaei" [i.e. the wicker-nets of the Gentiles]. How is it scoured?

Line 6



This is the vat itself, which is called "Mait" [Old French: the bin portion of a wine-press].


Hemp, which is very absorptive, and requires scouring with ash and water.
"Paveil" [Old French: a type of rush].
"Jonc" [Old French: rush], which is very absorptive.

'What you did at night' -- It was the way of the Persians to give women to their guests, and when they sent [the women] to them the previous night, Bati received [the woman], but Rav Yehudah did not recieve [the woman].
