Rashi on Bava Kamma



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

These are called Avos because they are written in the Torah explicitly, and the Gemara explains the Toldos are.
The order in which they are written in the Parsha they are ordered in the Mishna, for the first Parsha discusses the Ox, the second, Pit...

Line 2

Not, here is, Bull like the Mave - It is to say, had it been written, in the torah (only) Ox, does not come out Mave from it, and due to this it needed to write it, and for this it took the first part to be like the Mave, and did not take to it like the order, (i.e.) not in this the bull like the pit, more so due to, that it was not going to be able to teach, not this and this that have in them breath of life, that here, pit not in it breath of life, and a reason that is different, that there is here a novelty to teach us, that even though there is in both of them breath of life, does not come out one from its fellow. And the Gemara explains (later) what "not this" (lo harei) that it is said here.
Like the fire, that does not in it have air of life - And if not written by the Torah one would have said to exempt.

Daf 2b



Line 1

And one who is impure by a corpse - one who touches a corpse is a primary source of impurity. The corpse itself, however, is a super-primary source of impurity; one who touches it becomes a primary source of impurity who can then impurify people and vessels. The verse states: "Whatever that impure person touches shall be impure" [Numbers 19:22]; this verse is discussing one who is impure by a corpse, and implies that he can impurify people, since it states "and the person who touches..." [Numbers 19:22]

Line 2

Here what - the subcategories of Shabbat [labors] are equivalent to the primary categories; the subcategories of impurity are not equivalent to the primary categories. Here, what [is the relationship to] the subcategories of damages? Do we say that the subcategories are equivalent, and there is no difference between a primary category and a subcategory, in that in each case the one who causes damage must pay, or perhaps not?
There are among, etc. - later on in our discussion of this topic [the gemara] will explain the statement of Rav Pappa.

Line 3

The Horn - for goring.
The Tooth - for eating.
The Foot - trampling resulting in breaking vessels.

Line 4

With these shall you gore the Arameans / with them he shall gore the nations - so we see that goring is done with the horn.


Line 5

Texts of the tradition - the Prophets and the Writings.

Line 6

But is this a derivation - this is meant as a question -- but we don't derive either liability or exemption from texts of the tradition. Rather, it is a disclosure of the matter -- that anywhere "goring" is written it means with a horn.


Line 7

Rather - for the following reason it was necessary to state [the additional proof-texts]: one might have said that Scripture only differentiates between an innocuous ox and a forewarned ox -- in that regarding an innocuous ox it is written "they shall divide its price" [Exodus 21:35] and regarding a forewarned one it is written "that person must restore ox for ox" [Exodus 21:36], which means that he must pay full damages -- that refers only to a case where a detached horn was used; if, for example, the animal held the horn between its teeth and gored with it. [Only] in that case would the innocuous ox not pay whole damages, because this is not its usual behavior, and it was not the owners' responsibility to protect against such a thing.
But with an attached horn - since this is its normal manner.
Say that in all cases it is forewarned - even at the outset [before it had ever done such a thing] and he would have to pay full damages.

Line 8

Come and hear - the term "goring" is written regarding "the horns of the wild ox" [Deuteronomy 33:17] -- so we see that [goring with] an attached [horn] is also called goring. Thus with any unspecified goring [whether with an attached or detached horn], Scripture differentiates between the Horn of an innocuous [ox] and the horn of a forewarned one.

Line 9

Pushing - where it pushes with its body and damages intentionally.
Crouching - where it sees vessels along the way and goes and crouches upon them in order to break them.
Kicking - where it kicks with its legs and breaks the vessels. These are the subcategories of the Horn [Goring], in that their intention is to damage, just as with Goring; and there is no pleasure gained by the one who damages, just as with Goring; and these kinds of damages do not typically take place, thus also similar to Goring. If the court has not warned against this three times, one does not pay full damages.

Line 10

What is different about goring that it is characterized as a primary category, as it is written “And if an ox gores"; <i>negifa</i> also, as it is written "If one man's ox hurts the ox of another" - since <i>negifa</i> is also written [explicitly in a verse], it should also be considered a primary category.
This <i>negifa</i> is goring - and not pushing with the body.
The verse began with <i>negifa</i> - "If one man’s ox hurts [<i>yiggof</i>] the ox of another." [Exodus 21:35].
And concluded with goring - "or if it is known that the ox was a goring ox" [Exodus 21:36]. It is not written that "the ox was in the habit of hurting" but rather "goring".
To say to you - that the <i>negifa</i> [in this verse] is not pushing with the body but rather goring with the horn. It is not possible to say [alternatively] that in fact <i>negifa</i> is the primary category and "goring" is <i>negifa</i> meaning pushing with the body, since we have found [based on the verses cited earlier] that goring is done with the horn.

Line 11

With regard to a person - when the ox gores a person, it is written "When an ox gores a man" [Exodus 21:28] and when an ox gores an ox it is written "When any party’s ox injures a neighbor’s ox." [Exodus 21:35]


Line 12

A person, who has ingenuity - he has the understanding as to how to protect his body.
It is written "if it gores" - since the ox certainly had the intention to cause harm, and attacked him with force. But <i>negifa</i> implies that it found it standing and pushed it with its horns. Another interpretation: he has [the protection of] fortune, and it is not easy to kill him with <i>negifa</i> -- that is, with a slight pushing of the horn [alone] -- but rather [only] with goring, with force and intention and with the thrusting of the horn into the body.

Line 13

And Scripture teaches us a matter in passing - since it apportions the term "goring" to [where the victim is] a person and "<i>negifa</i>" to [where the victim is] an animal, implying that it is easier [for the ox] to kill an animal than to kill a person. This implies that an ox that was forewarned due to having killed an animal three times is not considered forewarned regarding [killing] people. Thus if it gored a person to death, it is judged as an innocuous ox, and [the owner] does not pay the ransom. Regarding an innocuous one who kills a person, it is written "the ox shall be stoned... but the owner of the ox is not to be punished" [Exodus 21:28]. Regarding a forewarned one it is written "its owner, too, shall be put to death" [Exodus 21:29]. "Death" there means monetary compensation, in that he must pay the ransom -- the value of the one who was killed -- to his heirs; not actual death, as it is stated in the first chapter of Sanhedrin: You execute him for his act of murder, but you do not execute him for his ox’s act of murder [Sanhedrin 15b:5]. However, [an ox] that is forewarned regarding [killing] people is considered forewarned with respect to animals. It is possible to [have a case of an ox that is] forewarned with respect to killing people, if it gored three times before being brought to court -- thus it had not been stoned immediately upon having killed the first [person].

Line 14



Line 15

Crouching... is a subcategory of Foot [Trampling] - since it crouches by way of folding its legs.
Trampling is commonplace damage - any time it walks it will trample anything under its feet.
These, the damage is not commonplace - therefore they are subcategories of Horn [Goring] in that theirs is not a commonplace type of damage, and imparts no pleasure to the one who damages; thus they pay half-damages as with Goring.

Line 16



Line 17

What is different about Goring - in that he is liable since its intention was to do damage, etc.

Line 18



Line 19

"And he sends forth" - his livestock to graze [Exodus 22:4].

Daf 8a



Line 1

Superior-quality and inferior-quality land, damages [are paid] from the superior-quality land, and [payments owed to a] creditor and [payments of] a woman’s marriage contract are made from the inferior-quality - by Torah law, a creditor [is paid] from inferior-quality land as is stated later on; it is the Rabbis who decreed that he [can collect from] intermediate-quality land, due to [the desire to prevent] "locking the door to borrowers". In a case where he does not have intermediate-quality land, the decree does not apply.


Line 2

Let his intermediate-quality land be classified as superior-quality - since it is considered "excellent" [Exodus 22:4] as far as he is concerned. 


Line 3

And he sold it - after the loan. The intermediate-quality land came under lien to the creditor at the outset, when [the borrower] still held the superior-quality land.

Line 4



Line 5



Line 6



Line 7

Both this [<i>baraita</i>] and that [<i>baraita&gt;</i> concern cases] where [the borrower] did not have superior-quality - and everyone [that is, the authors of both <i>baraitot</i>] agrees that [the quality of the borrower's land] is evaluated with respect to the world at large.
And it is not difficult, etc. - that which was stated [in the first <i>baraita</i>] that a creditor and woman's marriage contract [are collected] from the inferior-quality land -- is because his intermediate-quality land is comparable to general superior-quality land.

Line 8

Both this [<i>baraita</i>] and that [<i>baraita</i>] concern a case where his intermediate-quality land is equivalent to the intermediate-quality land of the world at large - and where he did not have any superior-quality land to begin with. It is with respect to this that they disagree: the <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i> holds that [his lands] are evaluated against those of the world at large, and on account of this the creditor can collect from the intermediate-quality land, according to the [usual] law. The other [<i>tanna</i>] holds that [his land] is evaluated [only] with respect to [whatever other land] he owns.
Another version: we have the text [instead]: "both this <i>baraita</i> and that <i>baraita</i> concern a case where his intermediate-quality land is equivalend to the <i>superior</i>-quality land of the world at large. The [contradiction], then, is explained as follows: both <i>baraitot</i> concern a case where he had superior-quality land [at the time of the loan] and sold it. It is with respect to this that they disagree: the <i>tanna</i> of the first <i>baraita</i> holds that [his land] is evaluated [only] with respect to [whatever other land] he owns. Since it is intermediate-quality with respect to his [other lands], even though with respect to the world-at-large it is superior-quality land, he pays from [that land]. The <i>tanna</i> of the [second] <i>baraita</i> holds that [his land] is evaluated with respect to the world-at-large. Prefer the first version [of the text].

Line 9

They disagree with regard to Ulla - the <i>tanna</i> of the latter [<i>baraita</i>] does not hold of Ulla's decree, but rather goes according to the [original framework of] Scripture: even if he also owns superior-quality land, which means that he has bona-fide intermediate-quality land -- both with respect to his own [property] and with respect to the world-at-large -- nevertheless, [the <i>tanna</i>] rules that the creditor collects from the inferior-quality land.

I am proper for its damage - It means to say, if the damge I provoked and Invited it to damage, I  did not keep good watch over it; like this I found (rashi).  Another interpretation, proper for the damage on me to right and fix its damage, it means, I am obligated to pay; these are the words from my teacher.

Line 2

This is not so with regard to a fire - with regard to a fire, one is not liable [to pay ransom] for burning a person [to death], since he should have escaped; and if he had been restrained, the one who lit the fire would be liable for the death penalty, and "he receives the greater [punishment]" [would apply], as is explained later in the chapter "One Who Brought His Sheep into the Pen" [Rashi on Bava Kamma 61b:9:1].


Line 3



Line 4

And something that is not fitting for it - later on it will explain that all instances of "ox" that are mentioned here [in this <i>baraita</i>] are referring to Horn [goring], and not to Tooth or Foot.


Line 5

Is liable for the vessels - if it broken them by goring or by kicking (which is a subcategory of Horn [goring]). Vessels are not "fitting for" fire, since it is not typical to fuel [a fire] with vessels.
The disagreement between Rabbi Yehuda and the Rabbis appears in the chapter "An Ox that Gored a Cow." [Bava Kamma 53b:13]

Line 6



Line 7



Line 8

Rather, actually, [the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with the opinion of] the Rabbis - and as to that which you had objected -- let the <i>baraita</i> teach that a stringency of Ox is that one is liable for [its breaking of] the vessels, etc. --  [the answer is that the <i>tanna</i>] taught [certain cases] and omitted [others].
Omitted [the case of a] concealed [item] - it ought to have taught that a stringency of Ox and Pit with respect to Fire is that if an ox kicked a sack full of vessels, he is liable; or if a donkey carrying a sack full of grain fell into a pit, he is liable -- even though [the vessels] are concealed in the sack. This is not the case with Fire, as we derive [Bava Kamma 60a:11] from "or standing grain" [Exodus 22:5] that he is only liable for exposed [items].

Line 9



Line 10

An ox [that is in the category of] disqualified consecrated [animals] - which had been redeemed [for profane use] and then fell into a pit -- the owner of the pit is exempt, as scripture states: "the one responsible for the pit must make restitution... but keeping the dead animal." [Exodus 21:34] This excludes this case where the dead animal does not [fully] belong to him -- even though it had been redeemed, if it dies, it is forbidden to feed it to the dogs, as is stated in Bekhorot [Bekhorot 15a:20]: "you may slaughter it" [Deuteronomy 12:15] -- but not shear it; "flesh" -- but not its milk; "you may eat" -- but not the dogs. That verse was dealing with disqualified consecrated [animals]. But, [on the other hand,] if an ox gored it, [as opposed to it falling into a pit, the owner of the ox] is liable, since scripture states "a neighbor's ox" [Exodus 21:35] -- even though it was [a disqualified consecrated animal that was] redeemed, it is [still] called "a neighbor's ox", and even though it states regarding Ox that "he shall keep the dead animal," [Exodus 21:36] [which ought to make the outcome like the case of a disqualified consecrated animal falling into a pit], we later on [Bava Kamma 10b:14] will establish that that refers to the owners attending to the carcass [and not that the carcass is free to be used for all purposes like shearing, milking, etc.] 

Line 11

Granted, if you say [that the baraita is in accordance with the opinion of] the Rabbis, then since [the <i>tanna</i>] omitted - [the case of damage done by an ox to] concealed [items] and [damage done to] vessels, [the <i>tanna</i>] also omitted this case [of disqualified consecrated animals].
But if you say [that the <i>baraita</i> is in accordance with] Rabbi Yehuda - then there is no omitted case here, since Rabbi Yehuda rules that he is liable [in the cases of] vessels [damaged] in a pit and concealed [items damaged] by fire -- so "what else did he omit [that makes it reasonable to assume] that he omitted this?"
What is this - we do not include this text.

Line 12

Trampled on his plowed field - if the ox trampled on his plowed field intentionally -- since oxen are accustomed to trampling -- it is considered a subcategory of Horn [goring], since [as with Horn], its intention is to cause damage. Therefore he is liable to pay the cost of the damage to the plowed field, which is not the case with Pit, since there is no concept of [a Pit's] damaging land.
As it is taught - above [Bava Kamma 9b:18], regarding the Ox, whose "manner is to proceed and cause damage" -- this refers to all kinds of damage. 

Line 13



Line 14

The latter is liable - whether the ox died in [the pit] or was damaged. The reason is explained later on in the chapter "An Ox which Gored the Cow" [Bava Kamma 51a:20] as being derived from Scripture.

Line 15

With regard to death, [the responsibility is ascribed] to the latter individual - if the ox died, the first individual does not pay at all, since the nine handbreadths [that he dug] are not enough to kill.
With regard to damage, [the responsibility is ascribed] to the two of them - if the ox was damaged but did not die, they must, between the two of them, make restitution.

Line 16

Rav Pappa said - the <i>mishna</i>, which taught "as if I were the one who facilitated the entire damage" -- only the last [digger] is liable; we are discussing a case in which the ox died.
And unanimous - since even Rabbi says that with regards to death, [liability goes] after the last [digger].

Line 17



Line 18

But are there no more cases - where we would apply [the <i>mishna</i>'s rule] "as if I were the one who facilitated the entire damage it caused"?
But isn't is possible - to mention an additional case, such as if it happened to be that one transferred his ox, etc. Rabbi Zeiri is asking from a logical conclusion; [what he states] is not a <i>mishnaic</i> source.
And one of them was negligent - he went away and did not watch [the ox].

MISHNA: How is the hoof deemed forewarned - that is to say, for what [type of damage that it does] is the hoof forewarned?
Breaking in the course of its walking - that is to say, it is thus that it is forewarned, in that it [typically] breaks things in the course of its walking.
An animal is forewarned, etc. - the <i>gemara</i> will ask that "hoof" [the first clause] is the same as "animal" [the second class]; it already taught about "breaking in the course of its walking".


Line 14

If it was kicking - this is a difference [from its normal behavior] and [is thus] a subcategory of Horn; therefore [the owner is liable to] half damages and no more.
Or that pebbles were propelled from under its feet, etc. - even though this is not a difference, but rather is its normal behavior, nevertheless [the owner is liable to] half damages and no more, because it is a <i>halakha</i> learned through tradition. This [ruling] is stated [regarding damage that occurred] in the property of the injured party, since [if it had occurred] in the public domain [the owner] would be exempt, as was established at the beginning of the first chapter [Bava Kamma 3b:12]: that pebbles are a subcategory of Hoof in that they exempt [the owner of the animal for damage caused] in the public domain.
And it fell upon a vessel - another [vessel].
First - [damage to the first vessel] is considered Hoof damage, and [the owner] must pay full [damages]. The latter [vessel] was broken by Pebbles; therefore [the owner pays only] half damages.

Line 15

A <i>delil</i> tied to its leg - anything tied to the chicken's leg is called <i>delil</i>; others have the text as <i>deli</i>.
Hopping - i.e., dancing.
Pays half the damage - since a <i>delil</i> is equivalent to Pebbles, as is explained by the <i>gemara</i>, that [the chicken] moved [the <i>delil</i>] [Bava Kamma 19b:10]. So too hopping, where for example the pebbles sprayed out and broke the vessels.

Daf 24a



Line 1

If it performs its gorings at intervals - on three days.
Liable - as it is written, "from yesterday and the day before." [Exodus 21:29]
If her sightings occur at intervals - three sighting on three days -- she is impure for seven days, as it is written "has had a discharge of blood for many days," [Leviticus 15:25] and we expound "days" -- two; "many" -- three. [Sifra, Metzora Parashat Zavim, Section 5:8]
If her sightings were consecutive - on one day, she considered pure with respect to the seven-day impurity, but must "guard one day against the next" [a one-day impurity].

Line 2

[The verse] states: "And this..." etc. - and it is due to scriptural decree that we do not expound an <i>a fortiori</i> argument [that the <i>zava</i> becomes impure for seven days due to sightings on one day].
The <i>zav</i> with the number of sightings - because the word <i>zov</i> is written three times in that verse [Leviticus 15:3], followed by "his impurity means this," which implies that it is through these three [sightings] that the <i>zav</i> becomes impure; it also writes "this" which implies that this only applies to what is [specifically] written about [in that verse, namely]: a <i>zav</i> [becomes impure] due to sightings. However, a <i>zava</i> is not [impure for seven days] due to sightings [alone].

Line 3



Line 4



Line 5

Deals with sightings - that "and this" [Leviticus 15:3] is written regarding sightings [by a <i>zav</i>] and excludes [impurity for seven days due to] sightings of a <i>zava</i>.
Excludes days - in the form of a question.

Line 6

Only with regard to reversals - that if it reverted for three days following its being forewarned, in that it saw oxen and did not gore, it reverts to its innocuous status.

Line 7



Line 8

In accordance with Rabbi Yehuda - in the mishna [Bava Kamma 23b:16].
His analysis is with him - his reasoning and proofs are with him.

Line 9

To render the ox forewarned - and to exclude a case where he gored [three times] on one day.
Or to forewarn the man - we require three days in order to forewarn the owner of the ox.

Line 10

On one day - and they testified about three gorings on three days.
If you say - three days are only mentioned regarding [the requirement of separate days] to render the ox forewarned -- and to exclude where its gorings were performed successively [over fewer than three days] -- then it should be rendered forewarned, since its gorings were separated in time.
It is now that they testified against me - all three groups came on the same day, but the Torah says three days.

Line 11

And testified against in the presence of its owner - and testimony is only given in court.

Line 12

There are three separate testimonies here - so that if one of them was nullified, the other two are not nullified, and through them [the owner still must] pay half damages. If none of them are nullified it is rendered forewarned.
But they are considered as one with regard to conspiring testimony - because it is through all three of them that it is rendered forewarned. Therefore, they are considered as one testimony regarding that, since if the first group is found to have been conspiring witnesses, [the owner] would only have to pay half damages for the third goring.
And they - the conspiring witnesses.

Line 13

Are exempt - from paying for the third goring. Even though they caused him to have to pay full damages for it, they are exempt, since witnesses only pay money when all of them have been found to be conspiring witnesses.

Line 14

They are all liable - [all three groups] collectively [are liable] to pay [the additional] half damages due to [the ox] being rendered forewarned upon the third goring. As for the "innocuous" aspect [of the damage done by the third goring], the last two witnesses who testified to [the goring] must pay [the corresponding other half of the damages].

Line 15

If you say that [the purpose of the testimony is] to render the ox forewarned - then three days are required; but as for the man, he can be forewarned on one day -- we can then set up this case as a case where all [the groups of witnesses] came on one day. The third one who was damaged brought them to testify about the three gorings on three days. Therefore the first [groups of witnesses] are relevant to [the adjudication of] the ox being forewarned, since [through their testimony the third plaintiff can show that] there is a basis for the matter, and they came to render it forewarned. Thus [the first two groups of witnesses] cannot say that we came to prove liability from the earlier cases and not to render it forewarned -- because they certainly know from [the third group] that they have brought [testimony against] a thrice-goring [ox]. What then could [testimony about] the earlier gorings [accomplish] but to render it forewarned; after all, [all three groups] arrived together.

Line 18

Whichever way you [look at it] - since you have equated the property of the first person with a Pit, but [have declared damage caused by] the property of the second person to be exempt from liability.
If one who stumbles is considered negligent - and is considered as if he has discarded his nuisances in the public domain, and that is why [damage caused by] the property of the first person [causes him to incur] liability.
The second should also be liable - for damage rendered by his property to the body of the third person.
And if he is not considered negligent - and you are equating him with a victim of circumstances beyond his control.
Even the first should be exempt - even for damages caused by his own body, and how much more so for [damage caused by] his property.

Daf 31b



Line 1

This is our accepted text: "The first is certainly considered negligent; the second is deemed liable to pay for damage caused by his body, as he had the opportunity to stand up and he did not stand up. For damage caused by his property, he is exempt, as he can say to him: I did not dig this pit. An objection is raised: All of them are liable for damage caused by their bodies..." etc., until: "What is the reason? It is because it is effectively a pit, and we do not find that in the category of Pit one is liable to pay restitution for damage caused to vessels. This works out well according to Shmuel, who says..." etc. "... But according to Rav [...] what is there to say? [...] Rav Adda bar Minyumi interpreted it..." etc. And the explanation of it is as follows: the first person is liable for damage cause to the second person, whether he was damaged by the body of the first person or whether he was damaged by the property of the first person. His body is judged according to the law of [a Person] who damages, and is [therefore] liable even for [damage to] the second person's utensils -- we do not equate [the law of damage done by] his body to the law of the Pit. His property[, however,] is in the category of Pit -- he is [therefore] liable for [damage caused to] the body of the second person and exempt for [damage done to] his utensils. If [the first person's] property damaged [the second person's] property -- since Pit is liable for damage to a person, as we have said earlier: when do we apply the exposition of the verse "an ox" [Exodus 21:33] but not a person -- with regard to a situation where the person is killed, but with regard to damages, [the digger of the pit] is liable [Bava Kamma 28b:2]. But [Pit] is exempt for [damage caused to] utensils. The second person is liable for damage caused to the third person -- according to the law of [a Person] who damages -- where [the third person] was damaged by the body of the second person, but not for damage caused by his property. If the second person's property damaged the third person's body, he is not liable -- not even the law of Pit is applicable to the second person's cookware to the extent that it would have made him liable to the damage it caused, not even if it caused damage to the third person's body.
The first is certainly negligent - since he fell on his own. Therefore as to [damage caused by] his body he is considered as a Person who damages; as to his property he is considered as one who dug a Pit. He is nevertheless liable for [damage done to] the second person's body. Rava holds that the Rabbis did not disagree with Rabbi Meir as to whether one who stumbles is considered negligent; [in contrast to how] Abaye earlier [Bava Kamma 29a:3] established that they disagree with regard to two [different situations]. Rather, [Rava holds that] they only disagree [in a situation where the damage was caused after the person's fall] with regard to one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property. But one who stumbles on his own is considered negligent according to all.
The second person - in falling is a victim of circumstances beyond his control, regarding [damages directly caused by his falling] body; nevertheless he is liable [for damage caused by the third person stumbling over his fallen body] as one who damaged deliberately, since he should have stood up and did not stand up.
He is exempt [for damage caused by] his property - entirely, even though he should have stood up.
As he can say to him: I did not dig this pit - rather, the first person did. We said earlier that one who renounces ownership of his hazardous property after a fall due to circumstances beyond his control [Bava Kamma 29a:5] is exempt.

The ox of a Jew that gored the ox of a Samaritan, [the owner] is exempt - later on [Bava Kamma 38b:14] the reason is established, that it is a penalty that was imposed so that Israel would not assimilate with their daughters. This penalty suffices; they did not, however, penalize them to the extent of making them pay full damages for an innocuous [ox's damage]. But Rabbi Meir considers Samaritans to be like gentiles.

Line 10

They are lion-proselytes - it is explained in the book of Kings: "GOD sent lions against them" [II Kings 17:25] and that there was written regarding Samaritans: "The king of Assyria brought [people] from ... Cuthah" [II Kings 17:24]. Other locations are [also] indicated [there].


Line 11

From Rekem are ritually pure - a city that was majority gentile. Gentile blood is pure by Torah law, as is written "When a woman at childbirth bears" [Leviticus 12:2] -- a Jewish woman becomes ritually impure at childbirth and by menstruation, but not a gentile woman. Even though the Sages decreed that they be considered like <i>zavim</i>, they did not extend their decree to their bloodstains, since bloodstains of Jews are themselves [impure only] due to Rabbinic law; with respect to Torah law, it is written "her discharge being blood from her body" [Leviticus 15:19] -- it should appear from her body [in order to be considered impure], not that it be found on her clothing. Even if [a gentile woman] saw it from her body, we have stated in Tractate Niddah that a gentile woman's blood is only decreed to be ritually impure when it is still moist [Niddah 34a:2], as it states in the mishna: "The blood of gentile woman ... Beit Shammai deem them ritually pure, and Beit Hillel say: it is like her saliva and her urine" [Niddah 34a:2] -- they impart ritual impurity when moist and do not impart ritual impurity when dry.
 Rabbi Yehuda deems [them] impure because they are - most of them were converts, and their blood imparts ritual impurity, and they are considered as Jews except that they have strayed and behave according to gentile customs; they are like apostate Jews.

Line 12

From among Jews, etc. - in Tractate Niddah we ask, "if [they deem stains] that come from a Jewish woman pure, whose [stains] do they deem impure?" [Niddah 56b:16]. And we answer as follows: from among Jews and from among Samaritans, [stains] are deemed ritually impure. Those that are found in Jewish cities in an ownerless place are ritually pure, since they were not suspected of discarding their bloodstain[ed clothing], but rather would put them away to prevent them from rendering impure things that need to be kept pure. As for those found among the Samaritans, Rabbi Meir declares them impure, since they were suspected [of discarding] their bloodstain[ed clothing]; the Sages declare them pure, since they were not suspected of discarding their bloodstain[ed clothing], but would instead put them away until they could launder them. Thus from the fact that Rabbi Meir says that the blood of Samaritans imparts ritual impurity, it implies that they were true converts.

Daf 45a



Line 1

It is sold - for the purpose of plowing.
If he consecrated it, it is consecrated - the practical implication is that if he derived benefit from it, he [is considered to have] misappropriated [Temple funds].
It is returned - even though the court [subsequently] takes it, the bailee is exempt, since when he returned it it was a perfectly good ox.

Line 2

It is not consecrated - since it is not [considered to be] in its owner's possession [as far as giving him the ability] to consecrate it.

Line 3

With regard to items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit one does not say: That which is yours is before you - the practical implication is for one who stole leavened bread, and Passover came and went, and he returned it -- it is not considered returned.


Line 4

As if so - [namely,] that according to the Rabbis one doesn't say [that which is yours is before you].
Let them dispute - [let] the Rabbis [dispute] regarding leavened bread on Passover, and let them say that he is liable [to reimburse the value of the leavened bread to the one from whom he stole it]. But we established in [the chapter of] "One Who Robs Another of Wood" that according to the Rabbis, he can say "that which is yours is before you," as is taught: if one robbed another of leavened bread, and Passover elapsed over it, and he returned it; and similarly, an ox before its verdict, one may say to him "that which is yours is before you," but not once its verdict has been issued. [Bava Kamma 98b:6] And is it not a rationale that the Rabbis accepted and thus taught that they concede regarding unleavened bread [after] Passover, that regarding items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit one may say "that which is yours is before you"? Rather, all agree that one may say "that which is yours is before you" regarding items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit where the prohibition comes automatically, such as with leavened bread on Passover, where one cannot say to the other "this is of no consequence." But here, it is because of this that the Rabbis say it is not considered returned: since [the owner could have] said to [the bailee] "now you have let my ox be seized", etc., this is an active form of damaging in that [the bailee complied with] taking [the ox] to the court. The language [Rabba] chose "if you had returned [the ox] to me" is not to say that the liability is because he did not return it to him [before the court case], because if so, he could also have said in the context of the case of leavened bread on Passover "if you had returned it to me I would have eaten it" [and thereby cause the robber to be liable]. Furthermore, according to Rabbi Ya'akov as well, since [he holds that] the verdict for an ox can be issued in its absence, let him say "if you had returned it to me I would have slaughtered it". Rather, the Rabbis do not make him liable for returning it now not having returned it earlier; regarding items from which it is prohibited to derive benefit one does indeed say "that which is yours is before you". Rather, his liability comes because [the bailee] actively brought [the ox] before the court. Then [the owner] says to [the bailee] as follows: "you shouldn't have brought it to court; if it was in my hands I would have smuggled it away from them."

Line 5



Line 6

Ultimately, they would have issued the verdict anyway - therefore it is damage that happened automatically, and not through active action.

Line 7

Just as the owner [is sentenced to death] only in his presence - as is written, "unless he has stood trial before the assembly" [Numbers 35:12].

Line 8



Line 9



Line 10

If he safeguarded it - with superior safeguarding.
All of [the other bailees] should also be exempt - from [reimbursing] the value of the ox --  except from the borrower -- since they are victims of circumstances beyond their control.


Line 11

Reduced safeguarding - [like, for example,] a door that can withstand normal winds.
Fulfilled his safeguarding duties - since he does not have to strengthen its safeguarding, that was sufficient, and is not considered negligence. Therefore he is exempt from liability for the value of the ox -- with respect to the owners -- since a reduced safeguarding was sufficient. However he does require atonement [i.e. is liable for ransom].
Those have not fulfilled their safeguarding - since they were required to have strengthened its safeguarding so that it would have been guarded on behalf of its owners; it is negligence, analogous to theft and loss [for which those other bailees would have been liable].

Line 12

In accordance with whose opinion? If it is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Meir - who says in the <i>mishna</i> [Bava Kamma 45b:8] that it is not sufficient [to guard] a forewarned ox with reduced safeguarding, and therefore also teaches that they must pay ransom.

Line 3

<i>Mashkukhit</i> - later on it will be explained as something that draws the whole flock after it.


Line 4

What are the circumstances? If by pulling - where he struck it with a rod and it ran before him; that is the manner of a small animal.
Let him acquire it by pulling - why do I need the conveying of the <i>mashkhukhit</i>?
If it was by conveying - that he acquired it, where it was [in] a public domain or a courtyard not owned by either of them -- since pulling does not effect acquisition there, since pulling is only [effective] in an alley or a courtyard belonging to the two of them. [This is stated] in [the chapter of] One Who Sells a Ship in Bava Batra [Bava Batra 76b:3].

Line 5

<i>Karkashta</i> - as we have the text, a bell which when he rings it in front of the flock, they all follow him.
The goat that goes at the front of the flock - the owner of the flock has a sharp goat. It is the manner of goats to walk at the front and the flock will follow them.
He renders the leader blind - he gouges out the eyes of the goat that is leading them so that it stumbles and falls into pits, with the flock following. Similarly, when the Omnipresent exacts punishment from the haters of Israel [a euphemism for Israel itself], he appoints unfit leaders for them.

Line 6

MISHNA: The first covered it - [after] when he had used it.
And the second came - to use it.
And found it uncovered - if, for example, the cover rotted and broke.
The second one is liable - and the first one is exempt. It will elaborate in the Gemara as to how long [after the cover breaks] the first remains exempt. But if the first one did not cover it, and the second came and saw it uncovered and did not cover it [either], they are both liable. From the fact that it teaches that the second is liable, we [must] establish the case that the first one left [the pit] to be used by the second one, and relied upon him to cover it.
If he covered it appropriately - and the ox or donkey passed over it, and fell and died.
He is exempt - and in the Gemara it will ask, if it was [covered] appropriately, how could it fall? [Bava Kamma 52a:11]

Line 7

If it fell forward due to the sound of the digging - [this case involves] a previously-dug pit, into which a hired digger goes to widen or deepen it. An ox is walking at the edge of the pit and hears the sound of the hammer, and is frightened, and falls forward into the pit.
He is liable - that is, the owner of the pit, even if the ox is of standard intelligence. It is stated later on in a <i>baraita</i>, that the owner of the pit is exempt since [the ox] should have looked carefully while walking [Bava Kamma 54b:5], whereas here [the owner of the pit] is liable since the sound of the digging frightened it. In the Gemara it will be asked why we don't say that the one who was digging caused it [Bava Kamma 53a:10]. Another interpretation: [If it fell] forward due to the sound of the digging - the owner of the pit is liable, since even though it is possible to saw that the one who was digging caused it, and the one who was digging only caused [the ox's falling] indirectly -- as we have established [elsewhere], that one who frightens another is exempt with respect to human laws -- and so we should let both [the owner and the digger] be exempt; nevertheless, the owner of the pit is liable, in accordance with the view of Rabbi Natan, as is explained in the Gemara [Bava Kamma 53a:10]. So I have heard.
Backward due to the sound of digging, he is exempt - as is explained in the Gemara: once the first clause states "due to the sound of the digging", the latter clause also states [using a similar formulation] "backward due to the sound of the digging."

Line 8

With the ox's accoutrements - the yoke and the plow are susceptible to being broken. As for the donkey's accoutrements, the bundle of clothes and the saddle on its back are susceptible to being torn.

Line 9

A deaf ox, and [ox that was an] imbecile, or young, etc. - will be explained in the Gemara.
A boy or girl - that is to say, even though they are minors, and one cannot say that they should have looked carefully while walking -- nevertheless, [the owner of the pit] is exempt by decree of Scripture: "an ox" [Exodus 21:33] and not a person; "a donkey" and not vessels.

Line 10

GEMARA: And until when is the first person exempt - where the second came and made use of it and did not cover it, until when does the entire liability devolve upon the second person, leaving the first person exempt?
For the time necessary to become aware - for the first to also be able to come afterwards and see it uncovered; since both of them [now] know that it is uncovered, the liability devolves upon both of them.
And Shmuel says: For the time necessary for others to inform him - even though he does not come and see it, he is liable for his portion, and [the liability] does not entirely devolve upon the second one, since he did not [himself] uncover it such that he should be liable under the rubric of "one who opened" it. Such was the interpretation of my teachers. Another interpretation: For the time necessary for others to inform him - even if he came and saw it, he is exempt until others inform him. The first interpretation is correct.
And cut cedar trees, etc. - but as for the second person who came to use it -- we don't give him such a long time [of exemption until later become liable], since he should have appointed lookouts over [the pit].

Line 11



Line 12

And weakened it - they damaged it and caused it to be in an impaired state.
And oxen came and fell into it - for if camels fell into it, it would go without saying that he would be liable, since he is negligent with respect to camels.
If camels are commonly found there, he is negligent - even with respect to oxen, since he should have realized that the camels would weaken it.

And both this and that refer to the pit - and the Mishna informs us that nevertheless [the owner of the pit] is exempt, since it did not die due to the fumes but due to the impact, and it was the public ground belonging to the inhabitants of the public domain that damaged it.


Line 2



Line 3



Line 4



Line 5



Line 6



Line 7

Rabba said here we are dealing with - in that that <i>baraita</i> taught that [if it fell] on its back [the owner of the pit] is liable.
Where it tumbled; where it fell on its face - at the outset, but before it reached its floor it flipped over and fell on its back.
Which were effective - the fumes that entered it at the beginning of its fall, and were sufficient to kill -- that was what killed it.

Line 8

Here we are dealing with damage to the pit that is caused by the ox - in that the ox entered the [pit] owner's courtyard without permission, and [the pit owner] had made neither the property nor the pit ownerless. [The ox] fell into the pit and contaminated the water in it.


Line 9

Manner of falling - forward; this implies that most animals that fall into a depth fall forward.

Line 10

If it fell forward due to the sound of the digging, he is liable. But why is this so? Let us say that it is the sound of the digger that caused it - the digger is exempt because [what he did] was mere indirect action. (And even if the digger was the pit's owner, one could possibly declare him exempt, for the following reason: Since [the ox] fell in due to indirect action, the question of liability due to the pit itself is entirely removed, and [the question of liability] devolves to the negligence of the sound of digging; but that is mere indirection action, which is exempt -- a side note.) We are dealing with a case where the digger was not the pit's owner, but rather was hired by him; and, where the pit had already been dug previously. If this were the [actual initial] digging of the pit, the digger would be liable, since there is no [concept of] agency when it comes to sin, since it is forbidden to damage the public domain.
The owner of the pit causes the damage - that is to say, the damage is found in his [domain], and since it is not possible to collect payment from the digger, since the sound is mere indirect action, he must be payed by the owner of the pit.

Line 11

The owner of the pit is exempt - whether the damaged ox was deranged or whether it was of regular capacity, since the owner of the pit can say to [the owner of the ox that pushed]: if it weren't for your ox, [the other ox] would not have fallen. That pushing is a direct act, and not indirect action.
Rabbi Natan says: The owner of the ox pays half - since the two of them together killed it; even if the damaged ox was of regular capacity, they would be liable, since it is impossible to say that the ox should have taken care while walking, since its fellow [ox] pushed it.

Line 12

This is referring to an innocuous [ox] - the owner of [this] ox pays one-quarter; the reason will be explain subsequently.
That is referring to a forewarned [ox] - which is liable to full damages; each of them has to pay half whichever way you take it: if each of them did the entire damage -- that is, if it would have died as a result of either one of them -- now that they both did it, each of them pays one-half. If each of them did half of the damage, each one pays for what they did, since [the ox] was forewarned.

Line 13

If he holds that this one performed all the damage - since it would have died even without the pit [being there], it is as if [the pushing ox] killed it entirely. Similarly, regarding the pit, since even without the [pushing] ox's goring attacks it still would have died, it is as if [the pit] killed it entirely. It is for this reason that [Rabbi Natan] holds stringently regarding the owner of the pit, [requiring him to pay] three-quarters.
This one pays half and that one pays half - since the owner of the ox also did all of the damage, and an innocuous ox pays half of the damage that it did.

Line 14

And if he holds - since both of them caused [the damage] together -- one causing half and the other causing half -- it is for this reason that the [owner of the] ox pays one-quarter, since it is innocuous, and must pay for half of what it caused.
And the owner of the ox - since it is innocuous, pays one-quarter. The owner of the pit, who is considered forewarned, must pay half; the remainder is a loss to the one who was damaged.

Line 15

Rabbi Natan is the head of the Court - [as stated] at the end of Tractate Horayot. [Horayot 13b:11]
How did my partnership help me - even without partnership I would have had to pay half. Since the owner of the pit also caused all of the damage, he must pay three portions.

Line 16

You killed it - I found it in your domain.
That which I can receive, etc. - but the Rabbis ascribe it to the first [ox], and hold that the owner of the ox caused all of the damage. Therefore, regarding a forewarned [ox], the owner of the ox pays the entire amount, and regarding an innocuous [ox], the owner of the ox pays half, with half of it a loss [to the owner of the damaged ox]. Regarding our Mishna as well, we [the Rabbis] ascribe it to the digger, so that both [the digger and owner of the pit] are exempt.

Line 17

If one left a stone - [by] a dug-out pit, and another person came and placed a stone at its edge.
We have arrived at the dispute, etc. - according to the Rabbis, the owner of the stone is liable, since he entirely caused the falling. It is not possible to exempt him due to [the rule of] indirect action in matters of damages, since the stone is also equivalent to a pit, making it direct damage, as is stated in the third chapter: To what is this similar? To [the case] of his stone, or his knife, etc. [Bava Kamma 28b:5]

"And fall" can indicate many - as in "Let, then, Bezalel and Oholiab" [Exodus 36:1]; "even if the sign or portent comes true" [Deuteronomy 13:3]; "and if a lion or bear came" [I Samuel 17:34].

Line 2

Anything else is not - how would I know [that] other things [which fall into a pit cause liability]?

Line 3

So to all [must be] animals - it is answering according to the Rabbis. According to Rabbi Yehuda, [however, the word] "and" comes to include even other movable objects.

Line 4

Birds - which do not impart ritual impurity through contact or by carrying.

Line 5

If so - that what is included [in the law of Pit] is only what is similar to the explicit detail in both aspects.
Let the Merciful One write [only] one detail - either "ox" or "donkey", and we would interpret this to mean anything similar to what is explicitly detailed. From the fact that it wrote the other [i.e., both], if it is not relevant to [teach that the law only applies to] something whose carcass imparts ritual impurity -- which is included in the generalization -- then apply it to birds, which are similar to the explicit detail in that they are living animals. It would have been possible to object to this: now that both [terms, "ox" and "donkey",] are needed, how would a human being be excluded? But instead, [the gemara] proceeds from the topic of birds and continues to raise objections until it extracts and explanation for everything.
Whose firstborn is not sanctified do not - such as horses and camels. The Merciful One wrote "ox", which was not [otherwise] necessary, since from the generalization one could have included even horses and camels, since they are similar to the explicit detail in two aspects: they are living animals and their carcasses impart ritual impurity. But birds, which are only similar in one aspect, would not [be included in the law of Pit].

Line 6

Rather - do not say that [scripture] returned to make a generalization so that [the verse] be interpreted according to "a generalization, followed by an explicit detail, followed by a generalization." Rather, I would say that [as the gemara proceeds to answer] "the verse states 'And the carcass shall be for him'", etc.

Line 7

Are vessels subject to death - in the form of a question. According to the Rabbis, why do I even need a verse to exclude them? And how would Rabbi Yehuda be able to include them? We could not ascribe to them the verse "and the carcass shall be for him." [Exodus 21:34]
Their shattering is their death - therefore according to the Rabbis, "donkey" comes to exclude them as [shattering] is not actual death. "Ox" comes to exclude a human being, which is not a type of animal. If the Merciful One had only written one [of the terms "ox" and "donkey"], I would have said that this excludes a human being, but not vessels, since what would [a specific detail] be coming to exclude but some other living thing which is [at least somewhat] similar to it? Therefore "donkey" is needed. According to Rabbi Yehuda, "or" comes to include vessels, even though they are not subject to actual death. "Ox" comes to exclude human beings [which are,] similar [to an ox,] living things. Subsequently the gemara will ask why Rabbi Yehuda would need the term "donkey" [Bava Kamma 54a:11].

Line 8



Line 9

A disqualified consecrated ox - which was redeemed -- the carcass does not belong [fully] to him, as we have established in Bekhorot in the second chapter regarding disqualified consecrated [animals] following their being redeemed: “You may slaughter” [Deuteronomy 12:15] -- but not shear it. “[You may eat its] flesh” -- but not its milk. “You may eat it” -- but not your dogs. [Bekhorot 15a:20]


Line 10



Line 11

An ox, but not a person - which is not a type of animal.

Line 5

An ox: deaf, an imbecile, or young - and ox that is deaf, or an imbecile or young, or blind; or walking on the road at night, even if it is of [standard] intelligence.

Budding - small grapes at the beginning [of their growth] just after having blossomed.
And how much it is worth - [that is, how much] the land can be sold for when [the grapes] are at the budding stage. [The Rabbis] are coming to be lenient [in that they don't require payment based on the value of fully-grown grapes].
In what case is this statement - in that we evaluate [the damage] with respect to the land['s value before and afterwards]?
When it ate young branches - the clusters are apparent at the time that fruits are first forming on the vine. This is recognizable even when they haven't blossomed into <i>bona fide</i> grapes. That is what is called <i>lulav</i>; the same goes, respectively, for shoots of figs.
But where it ate unripe - figs or unripe grapes, which are, like white beans [Mishna Maasrot 4:6], <i>bona fide</i> fruits, we view them as if they were etc.

Line 6

For injured parties from the superior-quality - whatever valuation [of the damages] that the court makes, [say,] one hundred or two hundred, shall be collected from land among his superior-quality property valued at one hundred or two hundred.

Line 7

And do not say - that which Rabbi Yishmael said [here], that "the best of" refers to the injured party's [property in the same way as does his statement] about which we had a question in the first chapter: "If it ate from a poor [garden bed, is it reasonable that] he pays [the value of] a rich [garden bed]? [Bava Kamma 6b:14] [There, in the first chapter,] Rav Idi had answered, "where it ate", etc., since the burden of proof falls on the claimant, so [the defendant] pays [as if it had damaged only a] poor-quality [garden bed]. Rather, that which Rabbi Yishmael said [here] that "the best of" refers to the injured party is not dealing with a case of doubt [e.g., which type of garden bed was damaged]. Rather, this is what he meant to say: he should compensate for that garden bed which it ate according to how much it would have been able to subsequently improve and increase in value.

Line 8

Line 12

Weakening of the vine - to deduct, from the payment, the amount that the grapes would weaken the vines by staying there until the grape-harvest, as they are constantly drawing moisture from the vine.

Line 13

Abaye said: They are certainly defined; who is the tanna who is concerned for the weakening of the vine? It is Rabbi Shimon - as we know from another source.
She will ultimately suffer - this demonstrates that we can deduct future weakening from the compensation.

Line 14



Line 15

Deduct the midwife - [this <i>baraita</i>] is discussing the compensation for the [miscarried] fetus; we deduct the fee that the husband would have had to pay the midwife in the future. The damages and pain suffered by the injured woman now, above and beyond that which she had when pregnant, are paid to the woman as Damage and Pain; it comes out that all is included. We then deduct the midwife's fee from the compensation for the fetus that is paid to the husband.
Deduct the sustenance - which [the husband] has to add to his wife's sustenance during her time of labor, being that now there will be no labor. It comes out [that from here we have another source] that we deduct what [the plaintiff] would have had to spend in the future.

MISHNA: The public thoroughfare - [which is] sixteen cubits [wide, as derived] from the wagons used by the [tribal] banners of the desert in Tractate Shabbat [Shabbat 99a:5].

Line 6



Line 7

The <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i> counts up from below to above. If two cubits or three cubits high, he is liable - and if four cubits, he is exempt, since he holds "until means until and not including." All agree that if four cubits he is exempt -- for our <i>tanna</i>, "until" means "until and including"; for the <i>tanna</i> of the <i>baraita</i>, "until" means "until and not including."

Line 8

Even in a field of thorns - even if the field to which the fire jumped over the fence had been full of thorns, which readily catch fire and allow it to leap, he is exempt.

Line 9

They [only] taught - that he is exempt.
Only where it blazes high - [as when] fire blazes high from a date palm and goes up.
But when it blazes low - where the wind bends it and forces it sideways, and interrupts the flame and causes it to leap. [Such is] my teacher's explanation. Another explanation: the fire blazes low, and travels, and catches onto grasses and chips on the ground; therefore, even if it crosses through a very wide public domain, he is liable.

Line 10

In what case is this statement said - that he is exempt if it crossed through a public throughfare.
<i>Shelulit</i> - this will be explained later on. [Bava Kamma 61a:15]

A stream - if there is a field on each side and a deep stream in the middle, one is obligated to leave over <i>pe'a</i> from each and every [field].
A private road - of four cubits[' width].

Line 15

<i>Sholelin</i> - gathers, as in "from a cluster of eggs" [Beitzah 7a:8]. Another interpretation: in the sense of "spoil and ... booty" [Numbers 31:11] -- something that is gathered.

Line 8

MISHNA: Only for the stack of wheat or barley - if it is wheat, [he pays for the] wheat; if it is barley -- barley.


Line 9

If there was a goat tied to it ... he is liable - for the goat, since living creatures are also included [in the law of fire] by "or standing" [Exodus 22:5]. We do not exempt him [from payment] due to [the rule of] "he receives the greater [punishment]", since he is not liable to the death penalty on account of the [death of the] slave -- since he was not tied up, he should have escaped; therefore he is exempt from death and payment on [the slave's] account. But if the slave was tied up, he is exempt even for the goat and for the stack, since he is liable to the death penalty for the slave, as it is written: "this must be avenged" [Exodus 21:20].  "He receives the greater [punishment]" even if [the witnesses] did not warn him, so that he does not get executed; we have established that those who unwittingly [commit crimes that would cause them to be] liable to the death penalty are exempt [from monetary payments as well]. [Ketubot 34b:9] Regarding the goat, it makes no difference whether it is tied up or not; but once [the mishna] made the choice [of language] regarding the slave, it made the [parallel] choice [of language] regarding the goat. Another explanation is that the choice [of language] regarding the goat is also precise: if [the goat] is next to [the stack] he is exempt, since it should have escaped. This is what it is saying: if a slave was tied to it or if a goat was next to it, he is exempt. Even though it was explained at the end of the second chapter that "the ox is comparable to other property" [Bava Kamma 27a:11] and if one placed a coal on it and it burned, he is liable -- [that applies only] there, where he put it upon an ox, which was not expected to remove it. But here, [the goat] should have escaped.

Line 1

He may say to him - to the one who was robbed.
That which is yours is before you - as it is, in its current state, since it is damage that is not discernible.

Line 2



Line 3

His offering - [from the verse] "if your offering is a burnt offering." [Leviticus 1:3]
But not stolen - since a stolen [animal] cannot come "to be accepted" [Leviticus 1:3]. [At this point] we assume that he stole an unconsecrated animal and brought it [as an offering]. [As the gemara continues,] "what are the circumstances? If we say," etc.

Line 4



Line 5

And according to your reasoning - under your assumption that he stole [an] unconsecrated [animal] and consecrated it.
That which is taught - regarding a <i>zav</i>.
His bedding - [from the verse] "those persons who touch his bedding" [Leviticus 15:5]. By scriptural decree, stolen bedding is excluded, in that it cannot become a primary source of impurity that is able to render people impure.

Line 6

Is there anyone who says that - any one of those <i>amoraim</i> [that would say that] a change does not cause acquisition? Aren't they only disagreeing as to whether despair [can effect acquisition]?
Who robbed another of an offering - which his fellow consecrated. Actually [the discussion involves a case where the animal was stolen] before despair. It is necessary to teach us that [such an animal] is not considered a [valid] burnt offering to constitute acceptance at all, even for the original owners, and even though there was no despair. Another explanation: one who stole his fellow's sacrifice does not acquire it even after despair, since sacrifices cannot be stolen, since "anywhere that it is, it is in the treasure house of the Merciful One" [Rosh Hashanah 6a:9].

Line 7

Thought renders them [susceptible to become] ritually impure - a homeowner would not typically sell them, but would turn them into bedding and side tables and covers. Once he mentally designates them as something fit for use without any further labor, they immediately become susceptible to ritual impurity.

Line 8

Belonging to a leatherworker - who typically sells them, his thought does not render them [susceptible to becoming] ritually impure, since he [is likely to] change his mind and sell them -- the purchaser would make them into shoes; their work in that respect is incomplete.

Line 9

Of a thief -- his thought renders them susceptible to ritual impurity - since he acquired them through the despair [of the original owner]. [The <i>tanna kamma</i> of the <i>mishna</i>] holds that the default assumption regarding theft is that the owners have despaired, since they don't know against whom to bring a claim.
Of a robber -- his thought does not render them susceptible to ritual impurity - even if he mentally designated them as something that requires no further labor, such as coverings for bundles, horses or mules, such as those which are made from bearskins. The reason being, that  the default assumption regarding robbery is that there is no despair, since he knows who took it and can sue him in court.


Line 10

The matters are reversed - the default assumption regarding robbery is that there is despair -- because he robbed him of it right before his eyes, he must be a powerful person. But the default assumption regarding theft is that there is no despair, since he believes that the thief will be found.

Line 11

Where he trimmed them - DROMIR in a foreign language. Because there are two factors: a physical change and despair. Otherwise, just despair on its own does not effect acquisition.

Line 12

But is it not the case that they taught this here with regard to a table top - where he mentally designated them as a leather table top -- a side table -- which one eats upon, which is similar to a table.
And a table top does not require trimming - it would also be susceptible to ritual impurity without trimming, since it is fit for purpose, since trimming is only done to beautify it. We know we are dealing with a table top, since it is taught nearby to [the current <i>mishna</i> under discussion] in Tractate Kelim "whenever no act is lacking," etc. [Kelim 26:7].

Line 13

Except for a table top - even though it lacks trimming, thought renders it susceptible to ritual impurity.

Line 14



Line 15

<i>Abrazin</i> - this is a table top in Aramaic. But despair on its own would not effect acquisition.

Line 16

As initially it was a beam - before it was installed in the building.
And now it is a <i>telala</i> - a roof, once it is installed in the large building and a ceiling of boards and a second story are put on top of it.
With regard to a <i>marish</i> - a beam. [This is one of] a series of ordinances from Tractate Gittin. [Gittin 55a:4]

They were disqualified - and their testimony was invalid.
Why - should they pay [the four- or five-fold payment] for the slaughter?

Line 8



Line 9

When they are subsequently rendered conspiring witnesses concerning the theft - when they are subsequently rendered conspiring witnesses concerning the theft, the matter becomes clarified, etc.


Line 10

Our version of the text: and the <i>halakha</i> is where they testified at the same time and were rendered conspiring witnesses - and we do not have the text as "and they were rendered conspiring witnesses at the same time," since they testified at the same time it is not possible to say that they were disqualified at the time of their testimony about the slaughter. Even if we say that they are disqualified retroactively [which would normally mean that only the first testimony was effective], since [both testimonies] were given in the same utterance, regarding conspiring witnesses it doesn't matter if [conspiracy was proved] all at once or one after another, as long as the conspiracy was proved regarding the slaughter first.

Line 11

If there were two testifying against someone, claiming that he stole, and they - themselves testified against him, that he slaughtered.
Is entirely invalidated - and [the witnesses] pay the double payment, and [the alleged thief] is exempt -- because he did not steal, he cannot [be said to] have slaughtered. Even if they subsequently were rendered conspiring witnesses regarding slaughtering, they are exempt [from the four- or five-fold payment].

Line 12

If they were rendered conspiring witnesses concerning the slaughter - and not concerning the theft.


Line 13

In what case is this statement said - that he pays double, and that the testimony regarding the theft is not nullified? Where there are two [separate] testimonies.


Line 14

By one set of witnesses, one after the other - who testified today regarding the theft, saying he stole on Sunday. The next day, [the same set of witnesses returned to testify] regarding the slaughter, and said that he slaughtered on Monday.


Line 15

And Rabbi Yosei says - that when the witnesses said to them "you were with us on Monday," they were rendered conspiring witnesses with regard to the testimony regarding the theft on Sunday as well. From where would this be derived?

Line 16

And what is that ... But if by one single testimony, at the same time - in which they testified regarding both matters, each within the same time of utterance of the other, and said that he stole on Sunday and slaughtered on Monday. If they were rendered conspiring witnesses for Monday['s slaughtering], even though they were not rendered conspiring witnesses regarding Sunday['s theft], it has been revealed that they were disqualified at the time they gave testimony. This is because Rabbi Yosei holds that they are disqualified retroactively, and the entire testimony that they gave at that time is nullified, since it is all one [act of] testimony.


Line 17

For speaking - this is explained later on. [Bava Kamma 73b:6]

Line 18

From here on - from the day that they were rendered conspiring witnesses, and not from the day they testified.
Concerning the theft they are not rendered conspiring witnesses - even though they testified as to both things at the same time, their disqualification did not commence from that moment, such that we would say that even though they were not rendered conspiring witnesses regarding [the testimony as to the events of] Sunday, nevertheless, the moment of their testimony was a moment of disqualification.


Line 19

They are rendered conspiring witnesses concerning the theft as well - this "being rendered conspiring witnesses" is not that they have actually conspired which would have made them liable to pay money, but that [their testimony] regarding the theft is disqualified on account of their being disqualified to give testimony.

Line 1

Was not in court - the court was not convened and the location was not a seat of the court; rather it was in the marketplace where he admitted it.

Line 2

As you have already admitted - this implies that even if witnesses had come subsequently he would be exempt [from emancipating his slave].

Line 3

Line 6

Is found, as determined through judges. This excludes one who incriminates himself - and why is this verse necessary? We [already] derive the exclusion of one who incriminates himself from "the one whom the judges convict" [Exodus 22:8]. Rather, conclude that one [verse] refers to one who admits [he is liable to pay] a fine with no witnesses, and one refers to one who admits to a fine when witnesses come subsequently. 


Line 7



Line 8

That is necessary to teach that a thief himself - to obligate the thief himself in the double payment, as the school of Ḥizkiyya taught, that we expound generalizations and specifications from <i>himmatze timmatze</i> [Exodus 22:3].


Line 9

I stole - and [thereby] obligates himself with the principal.
But I did not slaughter or sell - this teaches us an additional point, as we state later, that even though he did not admit to slaughtering, though it turns out that as a result of witnesses coming that he [in fact] slaughtered or sold it, he is exempt -- since he is exempt from the double payment due to admitting "I stole it," he can no longer be liable to the four- or five-fold payment. Since the double payment cannot be taken from him, this would result in him being liable to a three- or four-fold payment, and those are not mentioned in Scripture.

Line 10

And testify - after he admits, in which case he would be liable to the fines.

And [the phrase], "whoever strikes a man," that we learned here, it is [just the word (or concept)] "strike" that was meant, and it was learned from [the verse], "If a man injures his neighbor," since an injury comes from a strike.
