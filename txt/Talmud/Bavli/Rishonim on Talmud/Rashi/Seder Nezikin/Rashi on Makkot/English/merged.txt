Rashi on Makkot



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

MISHNA: How are witnesses made zomemim? etc.: In the Gemarah it will be explained what this is saying.
Regarding this certain individual: [who is a] kohen.
That he is he son of a divorcee: In our presence his mother got divorced before he was born, and therefore he is a Challal [Illegitimate Kohen] and disqualified [from kohen services].
It is not said: If they were made to be plotters and they are Kohanim. Make this one [the plotters] the son of a divorcee or Halutzah: To fulfill "Like they plotted". He takes on forty lashes: in the Gemara the reason will be explained.

Line 2

That is ruled for [the penalty of] Exile: That he killed someone negligently.

Line 3

GEMARAH: This is how we read it: Why! How are witnesses not made zomimen, it should have asked, and forthermore, as we will teach later on, (Makkos 5a) but if they said to him etc.
How are witnesses not made zomemim we should have asked: In which we can not maintain the requirement of K'asher Zamam [As they plotted].
Furthermore - Why is the question of the Tanna (author of our Mishne), 'How do they become false witnesses?'. Does it (not) teach further on (5b), how is the law of false witnesses (enacted), as is taught in the Mishne (further on). 'Indeed they say to them, the falsifying witnesses, how are you able to to testify this testimony you have given, were you not with us that day in a certain place etc.':

Line 4

Refers to over there - From (tractate) Sanhedrin (the author has) continued (lit. left off). That we learnt at the end of (chapter) The Following are Strangled, that is the end of (tractate) Sanhedrin, that there are false witnesses that are slightly differentiated from the (standard) laws of false testimony. Like that which is taught, all false witnesses we apply (lit. are introduced) to the very same death (as they which to inflict). That means to say they do not face (lit. look) to any other (method) of being killed, rather we apply (lit. awaken them) to that very death that the (original) accused (lit. judged one) was sentenced to (lit. judgement was completed):
Except false witnesses testifying against the daughter of a Cohen - (fully) married. That even though her judgement was (for death) by burning through their testimony (lit. mouths), they (the false witnesses) are strangulated. As we learn there (90a) her (death) is burning, but (lit. and) her adulterer (partner) is not (punished) with burning but with strangulation, just like any other adulterer of a married woman, and the false witnesses are (lit.) woken up to the (same) death that they wanted to inflict on the adulterer. As it is written (in scriptures) as they intended to do to their brother, and (we infer) not their sister. And it states here (at the beginning of our tractate as a continuation), there are other false witnesses that we do not establish with them the law of false testimony (as they wanted to do so should be done to them) at all, rather (they are given) lashes. And on this (point) it is explained (the mishne explains, beginning with a question). How are these witnesses that we cannot fulfil with them the (normal) laws of false testimony (lit) made into false witnesses (i.e. how do we apply the law of doing unto them as they intended to do).(Answers and carries on the mishne ) we give testimony etc.:

Line 5



Line 6

And not his seed - If you make him illegitimate (for priesthood) and he is (currently) a priest, his offspring will also be disqualified for evermore:
We require as they intended (to do to the original accused) - and he (the false witness) was falsely testifying, to disqualify the accused and his offspring: 

Line 7

One who profanes (others) does not himself become profane - A priest who marries a divorcee, that disqualifies his offspring, he himself does not become disqualified:
One who comes to disqualify and does not (successfully) disqualify -  A false witness that wants to disqualify and does not (successfuly) disqualify, how much more so etc. (alt. is it not logical etc.):
If so - If you come to expound this a fortiori inference with false witnesses, you will have nullified (the application of) the law of false witnesses:

Daf 2b



Line 1

And just as a (false witnesses) who (causes someone) to be stoned (note: past tense), do not themselves get stoned - Witnesses who are not found to be false prior the accused being killed, and after (the death of the falsely accused) are found to be false, are not killed, as we state later in this chapter (Daf 5b), If they kill they ae not killed, as it is written in Scriptures 'as they intended' (from which is derived) and not as they have done:
One who comes to stone and does not stone - That he is found to be false prior to the accused being killed:

Line 2



Line 3

He that did an act intentionally does not go into exile - A killer that did a deed, if he acted with intent, he does not go into exile, and even in a situation (lit. a time) that he is not killed, for example it was premeditated, (but) without (appropriate) warning (by witnesses):
They (the false witnesses) that did not do a deed - Rather (their action) was only verbal, and (although) their testimony was premeditated, is it not logical they should not go into exile for their premeditated intention:

If we were: around in the time that court would rule in capital cases no one would ever get executed as the gemara explains that they would cross-examine the witnesses in matters that they would not know how to answer.

MISHNAH: One Was Roofing With a Roller - They used to plaster their roofs with clay. [The roofs] were flat but the clay would give them a slight incline so that the [rain] water would run off. They would plaster it with a wide, smooth piece of wood that had a handle which they would push towards the incline and then draw it back towards himself, and then push it again etc. causing the clay to smear and smoothen. The pushing movement is referred to as "מעגל" - "ma'agal", and the drawing motion is referred to as "מושך" - "moshech". The wooden [tool] is referred to as a "מעגילה" - "ma'agilah" [a trowel]. 
He was lowering a barrel: from the roof.
If He Was Descending - [If ] the killer [was descending] the ladder and then fell off it killing [the victim] with [the force of] his body, he is exiled. All of these cases are [examples of] downward motion, which is what is required in order to obligate exile, as the Gemara derives [from the words of the verse] "and he caused to fall upon him."
However, If He Was Pulling - and the trowel slipped from his hand and fell. 

Daf 7b



Line 1



Line 2



Line 3



Line 4

GEMARA: Rava Said - This is the correct version. The [word] "אלא" is removed. 
He did it accidentally: And how to you call it willful?


Line 5



Line 6

“If He Came Upon Him Suddenly” This Excludes A [case when someone turns quickly] Around A Corner - The term "suddenly" implies proximity, as the Targum translates it "B'takif" -  this excludes a [case when someone turns quickly] around a corner, i.e. if one was exiting from an alley and entering another by turning to the right or to the left, and [he is holding] a knife in his hand, and someone is approaching him from around the corner who he does not see and [therefore] kills. 
That he pushed him with his body: without intent.
This includes downward motion that is for a need of upward motion - E.g. one who wants to lift his hand with force while holding an ax, first lowers his body and leans forward so that he [subsequently] be able to lift with strength; and he killed someone while lowering himself. You should not say that since [the downward motion with which he killed] was needed for an upward motion he should be exempt from exile, for [the verse] states "and he cast it [upon him"].


And if one does not lie in wait - He did not intend to throw next to or near him, rather [his intended target was] the location to which he [actually] threw, but he was unaware that there was someone there. ...

Line 7

Excludes One Who Intended To Throw Two And Threw Four: And similarly one who [intended to] throw four and threw eight. 
So too all [cases] that have permission for the victim etc.: This excludes a privately owned courtyard.

Line 8

IS THIS [A SITUATION OF] ASCENT OR DESCENT - Do we determine [the law] based on [the direction of] the individual, and he was engaged in an upward motion; or do we determine [the law] based on [the direction of] the rung, and the person ascending upon it was applying pressure as he pushed it downwards?
You've Already Touched Upon it etc. -  You are touching upon [the concept] of "descending for the purpose of ascending," which we have already inclusively derived above as [a case where one would be] liable [to a sentence of exile]. 

Line 9



Line 10



Line 11

This is the correct version: Here is when the [knife is] descending in front of him and ascending behind him. Here is when the upward motion is in front of him but the downward motion is behind him. Here is when the downward motion is both in front of him and behind him. And here is when the upward motion is both in front of him and behind him. Any [incident resulting from an] upward motion  is exempt and any [incident resulting from a] downward motion is liable. Therefore, that which was taught "before him, he is liable, behind him is exempt" is referring to [a scenario where] the downward motion was in from of him and the downward motion was behind him, viz. he lowered his arm in order to [then] lift it with force. [So now] when he lifts it with force [if he kills] when lowering in front of him he is liable, [but] if he killed when lifting it behind him he would be exempt. And that which was taught "behind him, he is liable, in front of him, he is exempt" is referring to [a scenario where] the upward motion was in front of him and the downward motion was behind him, e.g. one who lifts his hand with force to the point where it [the ax] was lowered behind him over his shoulders, and then reverses [the motion] to lift [his hands[ to strike in front of him. [So now] if he kills when he was lowering it behind him he is liable, [but if] he killed when he was lifting it [back] he is exempt]. And that which was taught "whether in front of him and behind him, he is liable" is referring to the downward motion, whether it was before him or behind him. And that which was taught "Whether it was in front of him or behind him, he is exempt" is referring to the upward motion, whether it was before or behind him. 

Line 12



Line 13

Let us say that it is subject to a tannaic dispute: this question of Rebbi Abahu.

Line 14

Here [one is talking about the issue of] Damages - where he would be obligated to pay the compensation if he did not kill him but only caused him damage. For when it comes to damages there is no difference whether it was caused inadvertently  or intentionally, or whether it was done with a downward or upward motion, as we expound in Bava Kamma (26b) [when the verse says] "A laceration for a laceration" [this comes to teach us] that one is obligated for inadvertent damages as [he would be] for intentional damages, and for damages caused beyond his control as [he would be] if they we done willfully. 

Line 15

Here Is When (the rung) Is Rotten -  he would be liable [to go to exile] since every rotten rung when it is tread upon it buckles downward, thus constituting a downward motion. But if it is not rotten there is no downward motion. 

Line 16

Here [It] Is [Scenario] When The Rung Has Been Fastened - If the rung completely filled the hole into which it was wedged, and it grasps it very well, then there is no downward motion, and he would thus be exempt  [from exile]. If [however] it is not [securely] fastened, then there would be a downward motion, resulting in liability [i.e. exile].

Line 17



Line 18



Line 19

 The Transmission Is What Matters -  how the word is to be written as it was transmitted to Moses, that is the manner in which we are to expound it, and not the way  it pronounced. When you read "V'nashal" you are inserting the pronunciation of a "Aleph" or of a "Hey" between the "Nun" and "Shin", however according to the authoritative tradition it is written as "V'nishal," meaning dislodged, i.e. that the iron caused [a splinter] to become dislodged from the wood [tree] which hit his fellow. Whereas the Rabanan are of the opinion that it the way it pronounced which matters, and it is read "V'nashal" as a verb, i.e. the iron [ax head] itself became dislodged from its wood [handle]. 

Line 20



Daf 8a



Line 1



Line 2



Since You Might Have Said - According to Rebbi it should be like a case of secondary force resulting in his exemption, since the clod is the primary force and the falling of the dates was the secondary force. It therefore comes to teach you that the clod is analogous to the ax, and the dates to the splinter which ricochets.

Aḥitophel raised [this matter], etc. There is a wonder in this matter, for David did not purchase the threshing floor from Araunah the Jebusite until the incident of the incitement, which occurred three years after the death of Aḥitophel.
And according to these words, we must say that even though he had not yet purchased the threshing floor, he knew from his youth, from the day [he was anointed], and he and Shmuel sat in Nayot in Ramah, and they examined the Book of Yehoshua and found the location of the Beit HaMikdash, as it is written: “Until I find a place [for Hashem, a dwelling for the Mighty One of Yaakov]” (Tehillim 132:5). Link to verse on Sefaria
And as we expound in Zevachim, in the section “Which is their place” (Zevachim 54b), and he investigated.

This is how we read it: And as for where one is scripturally warned against it's consumption, to not eat from it in tumah, I do not know. The Torah says, "Do not proceed etc.": This is the wording found in the sifre. Ans when it was established here, there was not [time given] to complete it before the Gemara asked, "Why bodily tumah is explicitly written! 'And he may not eat from any holy until he washes etc.'" And we establish in Yevamos that this is referring to maaser from what is written "for if he washed" which would imply that if he did wash he would be tahor, that he immersed, ascended and eats maaser [sheni]. (Our Master, his body was tahor, and his soul exited in a state of tahora. He did not explain any further. From here and on is the words of his disciple Rebbi Yehuda bar Nassan.) This is the wording of the baraisa, to say, "I do not know where one is scriptually warned", therefore the Torah teaches us, "he may not proceed etc.", and the Gemarah was not quiet yet in finishing the matter, rather it proceeded and asked why does it say "I do not know"? Why, bodily tumah is explicitly written in the Torah, "the soul that touched it. etc. may not eat from the holy unless he washed his flesh in water", and we say in Yevamos, that this verse was said regarding maaser sheni, that he immersed, ascended and eats etc.
