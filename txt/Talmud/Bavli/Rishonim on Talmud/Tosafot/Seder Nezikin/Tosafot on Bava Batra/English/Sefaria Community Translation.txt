<b>They assumed, "What is a <i>mechitzah</i>? A wall":</b> Even though [this understanding] stands in the end, it said, "they assumed," since this version is not the main one, due to the challenge from later. And that which it answers [that challenge] is a mere deflecting (not fully satisfying). But the law is like the second version, and so does Rabbenu Tam decide; and once it [used] the expression, "They assumed," here - it also used it in the other version. And further (another answer is that) RI says that in the first chapter of Nedarim (11a), "they assumed," is found even though it stands in the end and it concludes like it.
<b>As it was taught in a baraita, "A partition of a vineyard that was breached":</b> There are texts that have the version, "as it was taught in a mishnah." But Rabbenu Tam says that this is not a mishnah in any place. (However if that is so,) how did [the Gemara] conclude from it in [the chapter entitled] HaGozel Kamma (Bava Kamma 100a, ff.) that Rabbi Meir judges [with] the law of <i>garmi</i>. As if it were a mishnah, it would come out well, since an unspecified mishnah is [from] Rabbi Meir! So Rabbenu Tam says that it implied that it goes according to Rabbi Meir based on the force of [the] mishnah in Kilayim (7:4) that it brings there, "One who causes his vine to overhang his fellow’s grain, the grain is rendered prohibited and he is liable for it." And that is an unspecified mishnah. Hence this too that is taught, "it is rendered prohibited," is [from] Rabbi Meir. But we should not elaborate more here.
<b>He may say to him, "Build a partition":</b> [Meaning] to the owner of the vineyard, and he is the damager. For the four ells' distance that they said to make is because of the work on the vineyard, as we said in the second chapter later (Bava Batra 26a). And [this is the case] even according to Rabbi Yose, who said later (Bava Batra 18b, 25b), it is upon the damaged to distance himself - behold, Rav Ashi said later (Bava Batra 25b), "Rabbi Yose concedes in [the case] of his arrows (when the damager clearly causes the damage)." And RI says that this is why it teaches, "He may say to him, 'Build a partition'"; and it does not teach, "He is liable to build the partition: Since he must warn him. And if he does not warn him, he is not liable for the loss. And that is also why it twice [mentions], "[If] it was breached, he may say to him, 'Build a partition.'" [Because] even when it was breached the second time, he must [still] warn him. For he does not figure that he liable to build it all the time. But if it is breached a third time, RI was in doubt whether he must warn him all the time, or maybe he does not need to warn him any more. But Rabbenu Tam explains that this is why it [mentions it] twice: To have us understand that if there is an addition of a two hundredth between what [grew] during the first breach and what [grew] during the second breach - that they do not combine to create a prohibition; and they [start over] each time. And I elaborated [about this] in [the chapter entitled] HaGozel Kamma (Bava Kamma 100a, ff.) and in the chapter [entitled] BeMeh Eshah (Shabbat 65a.) 

Daf 2b



Line 1

<b>[If] he neglected [it] and did not build a partition:</b> Specifically when he neglected [it]. But if he did not neglect and is occupied with it all the time, to build the partition, it is permitted, even though it added a two hundredth. It is as we learned in Tractate Kilayim (5:6), "One who sees a vegetable in a vineyard, and said, 'When I reach it, I will pluck it,' it is permitted. [But if he says,] 'When I return, I will pluck it,' if [the vegetable] has increased by a two hundredth, it is forbidden." Hence when he is pursuing its plucking, it is permitted even when it adds a two hundredth. And it can be explained that the reason is because it is written (Deuteronomy 22:9), "Do not plant in your vineyard forbidden mixtures" - that which is similar to planting, such that it is pleasing to him.
<b>And he is liable for the loss:</b> Even though damage that is not noticeable is not called damage (Gittin 53a). [As] it appears to RI that this is considered noticeable damage. For behold, it is noticeable that it is a forbidden mixture when he sees the vines [crossing over] into the field. But one who spread impurity - even though we see the <i>sheretz</i> (a category of particularly impure animals) on the pure foods, it is not considered noticeable damage. As who knows if they were made susceptible [to absorb impurity]. However it should not be said that also [our case here] is damage that is not noticeable but that the [Sages] fined him - like with the one who spreads impurity (Gittin 53a), so that everyone not go and render the pure foods of his fellow impure. For here there is no concern for that, since the owner of the vineyard will also incur a loss. And also, if it was a fine, he should only be liable if it was volitional. 

Line 2



Line 3

<b>But say, "What is a <i>mechitzah</i>? A division":</b> RI explains that it is because there are several difficulties with [understanding it as] a wall, as it challenges adjacently. Hence it forces it and explains a <i>mechitzah</i> as [being] a division - even though a <i>mechitzah</i> is a wall in every [other] place.
<b>And since they wished [to divide the courtyard], they build a wall in the center [even] against his will:</b> Later it is established [that this is a case] not subject to the law of division. But this is surprising to RI: As why did the teacher of our mishnah take [a case] not subject to the law of division, and teach, "who wished?" He should [more simply] speak about [a case] subject to the law of division. And he answered that we learn to deduce that I might have [otherwise] said that when it is not subject to the law of division, he would find to say, "It was on condition not to make a [bona fide] wall. I did not concede to you to make a wall." And there are some texts that explicitly ask and answer this at the end of the discussion.

Line 4

<b>I would say that a mere bordermark:</b> And the explanation of, "who wished," which it taught, is about a bordermark. And even though, even if they did not wish [a bordermark], they also make a bordermark against their will, as shown adjacently - as it says, "Is it not with a wall? No with a bordermark" - that means an inferior bordermark. But if they wanted [a bordermark], they must make a bordermark from non-chiseled stone or chiseled stone in accordance with the regional custom. And that is called a bordermark because it is full of windows - as it is explained in the Arukh - and it does not protect from damage to visual privacy. And also (another possibility is) because it is not ten handbreadths high, as is shown later concerning a roof that is adjacent to a courtyard. As Rav Nachman said, "He makes a parapet for it ten handbreadths high." And it challenges, "For what? If it is for damage to visual privacy, we need four ells; and if it is for [one crossing it to] be caught like a thief, a bordermark is enough! But [Rashi] explained that, "who wished," is referring to the splitting. But that is a wonder! As behold [the Gemara] concludes that a <i>mechitzah</i> is a wall; for if it were a division, it should have said, "Who wished to divide." Moreover, how could one find to say that I would have said it is with a mere bordermark? Behold, we understand [otherwise] from the end [of the mishnah] (Bava Batra 11a)! As it taught, "But when both of them wish [to divide it], they may divide it, even if it is less than this." And that is at least with a [more solid] bordermark. Moreover, how could one find to say, "With a mere bordermark?" Behold it is explicitly taught in our mishnah, "non-chiseled stone or chiseled stone."

Line 5

<b>They build the wall in the middle - that is obvious:</b> According to the one that said it is a wall, it is challenging [it] - like all those challenges from further on: For when they resolved to make a wall, one resolved like the other like this. So it is obvious that it is in the middle. But according to the one that said it is a division, one must say that you would have thought to say that on account of [preventing] the damage to visual privacy, he must help in building the wall - but he [actually] does not have to build it on his portion because of that.  

Line 6



Line 7



Line 8

<b>Come and hear, "And similarly with a garden":</b> Below we conclude that this is what it means: And similarly with an unspecified garden - it is like a place that people are accustomed to fence off. Hence [the Gemara] inferred well [from here] that damage to visual privacy is considered damage. 

Line 9

<b>A garden is different, in accordance with Rabbi Abba:</b> And if you will say [that] but, from that reason, he should also be liable to make a fence in a [cultivated] valley - it can be said that a garden is different, since we grow vegetables there to eat, so that [they] are standing all the time. But [the grain] is only standing in a valley for one month a year, so we do not obligate him to make a fence. But it is [nevertheless] forbidden to stand [there] at the time it is standing. And if you will say, but according to the one that said it is a division - since we have understood that it is considered damage even in a courtyard, all the more is it so in a garden - why was it necessary to teach, "And similarly with a garden": It can be said that it is necessary to teach, "And similarly with a garden," on account of non-chiseled stone or chiseled stone (to learn that they also need to be used in a garden).

Line 10



Line 11

<b>Fell is different:</b> Since they became accustomed to doing private matters in the courtyard and did not get used to being careful from one another.

Line 12

<b>And he who asked it, why did he ask it:</b> Meaning to say it is obvious that fell is different. So he should have, just the opposite, shown from that which it teaches, "and if it fell," that in general, it is not considered damage.

Line 13

<b>Damage of the public is different</b> And even though, below, it is implied that it is speaking about a courtyard that is not adjacent to the public domain, there is nevertheless damage of the public. For sometimes the public crowds [in the public domain] and enter there, as we say below. And [regarding] Rabbi Shimon ben Gamliel - even though he does not subscribe to the reason that sometimes the public crowds, [he holds that] they nevertheless can see inside from far away. And that is why he only argues about a gatehouse; but he concedes that we force him to build a door.

Line 14

<b>What, is it not with a wall:</b> This is a wonder. And let it be a wall - perhaps this is its explantion: We do not divide a courtyard even if one wants to build the wall within his [section] until there are four ells for each one. But if there are four ells in it for each one, we divide it - if he wants to retreat and build it within his [section]. However it may be said (the reason the Gemara did not entertain this possibility is) that, "divide," implies in the middle. For if it was to make us understand as we explained, it should have taught, "We do not make a wall in the courtyard until there is, etc."

Line 15



Line 16



Line 17

<b>It is different there, as the owner of the courtyard can say to the owner of the roof, etc.:</b> It is a wonder! Why did it not bring from that which we learned (in a baraita) later (Bava Batra 6b), "Two courtyards, one higher than the other; the top one cannot say, 'I will build from my level and upward,' but rather he assists the owner of the lower courtyard and builds [from below]" - hence, it is considered damage.

Line 7

<b>What is it teaching us? That when it is not subject to the law of division:</b> [The question is asked] even though it is teaching that it is considered damage. This is [the question's] explanation: What is it teaching us by that which it is speaking about when it is not subject to the law of division? Let it make us understand about when it is subject to the law of division that [even though they did not want] (when they wanted), they must divide it. It is [however still] a wonder! Behold it is teaching us that even when it is not subject to the law of division - that it can be said that [when] one [agreed to a partition, but] did not agree to making a wall, [he must still do so], as it explained earlier.

They collect according to the wealth of each individual: Since there is no life-threatening danger, we do not assess according to wealth. And this is also true in the last chapter of Bava Kamma (116b): A caravan traveling in the desert, and a troop of bandits stood over it, we assess according to wealth, for there is not danger to life since in the troop is attacking only for money. And even though it says in Sanhedrin (72a) that a tunneling thief is judged according to his end. And Rava explains that this is because there is an assumption that a person would not stand by idly while his money is threatened [and therefore, the fact that the homeowner would defend himself will lead the thief to respond with violence...thus a thief coming to steal money is prepared to act violently] even so, we assess [the caravan attacked by bandits] according to wealth, sinc the bandits only want to seize money, and if the caravan does not defend itself, they bandits will not physically harm them. Therefore, this is not considered a situation of danger. But in the case of bandits, if the caravan comes to terms with them, the amount is assessed by wealth. But when people get lost in the wilderness, it says there that the assessment is per capita, since when people get lost, there is danger to life.

As it was difficult for Rashba - let Job also be counted, as we say (Bava Batra 15b), "'And the asses were feeding beside them' (Job 1:14) - this teaches that [the Holy One, Blessed be He, had Job taste something akin to the world to come." But it can be said that Job was only in one matter, [whereas] He had Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov taste from all of it.

A different version: Rav Yosef says that he did not tell them to sit.... This version is difficult for the Ri. Why is the Talmud asking: what is the difference between the two versions? It is clear that they are explicitly arguing in the case where the specification as to where to write is missing. Furthermore we rule that we are concerned about unspecified deeds. If so how can he use the gift deed since he does not tell the witnesses to write it in the market outside. However, because these days it has been instituted to write in gift deeds: He told us to write it in the market and sign it outside, therefore even if he only told them to write it, he has in mind that it be written according to all rabbinical rules. But at the time of the Amoraim, they had not made this regulation, therefore he had to explicitly tell them to write it in public. And in the version of Rabenu Chanan'el it says that he told them not to sit in the open market, and this is considered unspecified, for he does not tell them to hide, but he tells them not to publicize it, and this is considered unspecified, not to publicize it, but not to hide. But if he simply tells them to write it, that is not unspecified, and is valid according to Rabenu Chanan'el. Therefore nowadays when the deed includes that he instructed the witnesses to write it in the market and sign it in the open, it is not a requirement, but only to improve the beauty of the deed. However the term unspecified does not seem to mean this.

...we should decree upon ourselves not to marry a woman: It is a wonder, as it is written, "be fruitful and multiply." And perhaps it is only referring to those who already fulfilled "be fruitful and multiply" [by having a son and a daughter]. And that the "descendants of Abraham will cease," is that they only give birth to a son and a daughter.

"And now that I have sworn who will annul it for me?" This is surprising why can't Ha-shem annul it himself? Since we concluded in the tractate of Holiday Offerings (page 10A) that oaths can be annuled from the pasuk "that I swore in my anger" (psalms 95:11) the Gemarah explains that one can annul it for oneself. "Since I swore in my anger, I can nullify the vow (ibid.)." We see from here that one can annul one's own vows. However, this doesn't make sense because it says "One can't go back on one's word." (Numbers 30:3) We learn from here that even a scholar can't go back on his own vow (tractate of Promises page 21B). It says in chapter four of the tractate of Promises (page 23A) that there was a launderer who dissolved his vow, but this doesn't mean that he dissolved it himself. Rather that he found a way for its dissolution that was then carried out by the Rabbinic authorities.

But here there is no possibility of repentance. And this is said specifically regrading the sexual sins that lead to no mamzer, but one who has intercourse with a married woman and gives birth from her, or from one of the other forbidden close relations, this is "a crooked thing cannot be made straight" (Eccl. 1:15) as it is said (Yevamot 21a) regarding teshuvah 'and behold Rabbi Chayim says that even though what is crooked cannot be made straight it is possible to do teshuvah as commanded by God, Who has commanded him to do teshuvah and sincerely repent, but a robber, whose teshuvah is dependent on returning what was stolen, as it is written "and he returns what he stole, etc." (Lev. 5:23), how can one who stole from the public know exactly from whom he has stolen to return [the property]? And even though it is said 'let him pay with [the stolen goods] the needs of the community' (Baba Kamma 94b) in any instance it is not complete teshuvah.
