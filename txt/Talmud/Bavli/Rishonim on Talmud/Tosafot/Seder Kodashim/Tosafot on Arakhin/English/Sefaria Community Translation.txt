Tosafot on Arakhin



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

1. Mishnah 'All can make an arakh vow' - in [Tractate] Nazir [2a] and in [Tractate] Nedarim (2a) it mentions colloquial terms [for those vows in order] that one not mention the Name of Heaven in vain as is stated there. Yet here there is not a concern to mention [with the regular terms] because we do not mention the Name of Heaven on <i>Arakh</i> vows. 'Arakh' [a set value based on age and gender] is written in the Chapter [of Arakhin in the Torah]. Vows of valuation are "my value is upon me", and we calculate you as a servant sold in the marketplace.
2. Can make an 'arakh' vow - if one says on another in the market, the 'arakh' valuation of so-and-so is upon me (or if he says the 'arakh' value of that person is upon me), he gives according to the years written in the Chapter of Shekalim. According to his [the subject's] years we go.
3. Can be subject of an 'arakh' vow - if he says 'my arakh is upon me' or if another says on him 'the arakh vow of so-and-so is upon me.'
4. Women and Servants - they pay after the time when the women gets divorced or the servant gets freed, so explains HaKuntros [Rashi]. Alternatively, for example, someone gives to them on condition that the master or husband not get rights in them [the gift, so they have their own funds to donate]. And even if they don't have to them [their own funds], we give upon them immediately [i.e. we write a receipt of their owing]. As was taught in the Tosefta "women and servants can make valuation vows or be subject to valuation vows. If there is to them [funds] now, we collect from them. And if not, we write on them [a receipt] and collect after the time." And servants even though regarding mitzvos they have the same rule as women, for 'arakh' vows they are [i.e. have the amount as a] male because the Tanna did not mention that perhaps if they were to have the 'arakh' amount as a female.

Line 6

<b>Everyone is obligated in <i>tsitsit</i>:</b> if they have a cloak [that requires it]. But if one is not able to buy [such] a cloak, they are not obligated - not according to the opinion that says the obligation is on the cloak, nor according to the opinion that says the obligation is on the person (Menachot 41a). For the only difference between them is about clothing in the cupboard. And even though an angel said to Rav Ketina, "[If you wear] a linen cloak in the summer and a <i>sarbela</i> (a coat which has only two corners) in the winter, what will become of <i>tsitsit</i>." That is to say, "Are you trying to find ruses to become exempt from <i>tsitsit</i>," as is explained over there. And he said to him, "Do you punish us (about it) [for a positive commandment]?" He said [back] to him, "At a time of [Divine] anger, we do punish [for it]." [Nevertheless,] that is specifically in those times when all [standard] cloaks had four corners that there was a punishment for the one that altered it to become exempt. But today - since most cloaks are exempt, there is no punishment for one who does not buy a cloak of four corners.
