We learn (Yuma 81b) from verses that one must make a Tosefes (addition) to Shabbos, both when it enters and leaves, to add from Chol to Kodesh! Answer: That small amount is not important, since it is Kalshehu (any amount suffices); R. Gamliel would agree that one must add that Shi'ur [to Shevi'is, when it enters and leaves].

Line 8



Line 9

Explanation: Surely, mid'Oraisa it is Batel, but not like we said above; Rather, he (R. Gamliel) holds like R. Yishmael. R. Gamliel was meticulous about why the traditions about Tosefes Shevi'is and Nisuch ha'Mayim were taught together; Everywhere, these three Halachos (including also Aravah) are taught together. They were given [to Moshe] this way. Surely, Hash-m did so to teach [that all of them apply only when the Mikdash stands].

Line 10

Explanation: We discuss a case in which we know that the [rain]water will not cease, and it is forbidden only due to the reason given (a decree lest he take from a low well); However, if they cease, there is an Isur like below. Regarding anything that ceases, we forbid lest he bring from a far place. Since he began to water it, [he must continue,] lest his field be ruined. Therefore, we establish here to discuss when it does not cease.

It truly looks like plowing. People who see it think that he intended for this. Explanation #2: It is considered like truly working the land. Even though he does not intend for this, it is Melachah. Implied question: R. Shimon permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven! Answer: We say that R. Shimon agrees about a Pesik Reishei (an inevitable consequence, e.g. one cannot cut off a chicken's head) and it will not die; Rabanan (who permit) hold that since he does it through a Shinuy, it is not a Melachah, and it is permitted, for it is not considered plowing.

There is no concern for this (lest it looks like he plows), for one who sees the ditch sees the manure in the ditch.

Explanation #1: The Makshan thought that "we fix the roads" does not include removing thorns. "Tikun" connotes fixing mounds and cavities. Therefore, he asked (that "all needs of the Rabim" teaches removing thorns); We answered that all of these were explicitly taught, for they are included in "we fix..." (Therefore, "all needs of the Rabim" includes digging pits.) Explanation #2: The Makshan was not so fluent in the Mishnah. He did not know that it says "we fix the roads."

Line 11

R. Chananel's opinion: We cited this verse, which was written regarding Ma'akeh (the Mitzvah to build a wall around a roof), for it is a Michshol (there is concern for injury). Inference: From the Mishnah with the Gemara, we can learn that one may not water land, except for what is Devar ha'Avud, lest the grain or trees planted in it get ruined. The same applies to other Avodas Karka. It is forbidden during Chol ha'Moed. Implied question: We say that one may water! Answer: This is only from an irrigation channel that passes through the field itself. It is not excessive exertion. One may fix pits and caves of an individual, and dig l'Chatchilah for a Rabim, since they need water. The Beraisa above says so, like I explained.

Line 12



Line 13

Explanation: [It is called only a hint] because the verse refers only to the future, but not to nowadays. However, he answered that we can learn from there.

Daf 5b



Line 1



Line 2


The law same applies to more than k'Se'orah. This is clear from the Gemara below that it is not Metamei b'Ohel. Implied question: Why did the Gemara discuss [a bone] k'Se'orah? Answer: This is the Shi'ur for Tum'as Maga. This is a tradition from Moshe from Sinai, like it says in Chulin (126a).
A spoon of a decayed dead person, like it says in Chulin (126b), a field in which a grave was plowed, like it says later in our Sugya [are not Metamei b'Ohel)]. Assertion: Even if there is a Safek Tum'ah that is Metamei b'Heset (through moving) without touching, it need not be marked; This is because Heset is not common, that one step on a stick on which there is Tum'ah. Therefore, Chachamim did not obligate to mark due to Heset.

Explanation #1: It is near a cemetery. We have a Safek whether or not there is Tum'ah underneath. Presumably we say that there is a Mes underneath, since it is a covert place. Therefore, one must mark it. Explanation #2: We know Vadai that there is Tum'ah under one branch of the tree, and there is a space between one branch and another, and we do not know where it (the Tum'ah) is. Explanation #3: We could also explain regarding rocks, that there are rocks near each other protruding from a wall [and there is Tum'ah under one of them...]

Line 8



Line 9



Line 10

Explanation: Stam, we say that the plow reached to the Mes, and we do not establish a Tahor place to be Tamei due to Safek. (I.e. even where the Mes was, it is not Metamei b'Ohel.) However, Chachamim were stringent due to the stringency of Taharos. Therefore, they were lenient, for there is not a Safek Torah; They said [to be stringent], and they said [when to be lenient]. They did not regularly bury deeply, like nowadays. Therefore, we are not concerned lest the Mes was deep under the plow (and a Shi'ur of something with Tum'as Ohel remains there.) Letter of the law, one should not even need to blow. It is merely a stringency of Taharos that Chachamim imposed in this matter. Question #1: Why aren't we concerned lest there is a Mes in the ground that he does not touch, and it is Metamei b'Ohel? Question #2: Alternatively, trees on the side towering [over the Beis ha'Peras] should be Metamei a person b'Ohel! Answer to both questions: This shows that it is not Metamei b'Ohel.

This is Beis ha'Ba'al, since it is normally dry. The word Garid ends with a Dalet. Also the Aruch says so. Alternatively text: However, the text of Tosfos of the Rav is Garir, with a Reish, like "wine is Garir" (arouses appetite).
Observation: The two arguments in this Beraisa are like the argument in our Mishnah and the first Tana here, who is R. Eliezer ben Yakov [who forbids for profit].

[We discuss cures for animals that entail Melachah] A cure that does not entail Isur Melachah, Chachamim just decreed against Refu'ah lest one grind spices, some permit even on Shabbos [for animals]; The Halachah follows the opinion that permits, like it says in Shabbos (53b). Rava expounded that the Halachah follows R. Yoshiyah, who does not decree lest one grind spices, regarding Refu'ah of animals. Rashi's opinion: "Lisrukei Susya" is rubbing and cleaning a horse with a comb. Rebuttal: We hold that both Kirod and Kirtzof (combing with a fine or coarse comb) are permitted (Beitzah 23a), according to R. Shimon, who permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven (a fine comb makes a wound), and the Halachah follows him! Conclusion: Rather, it is another matter.

Rashi's opinion: We ask about a professional. People of the city, even though they have no other professional, surely they are forbidden.
Question: I am unsure about one was sick and healed, whether he may shave. Is [his Ones] as evident as these [who are permitted in the Mishnah]?
