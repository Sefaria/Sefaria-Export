Even though at any rate it was decreed (that the children of Israel would go down to Egypt) as it says (Berieshit 15-in the covenant with Avraham) "and they will enslave them and oppress them" perhaps such great oppression was not decreed upon them. Rather the fact that the 4oo years began 3o years before Yitzchak was born demonstrates (that the length and harshness of the decree was not preordained)

Line 12

<b>And it is permissible to use its light:</b> And you may say, "From where did Rava [know] that Rav Huna held that it is permissible to use its light; maybe that which he said, 'We may not light [it] on Shabbat,' is because he held that if it becomes extinguished, he is bound to it, but he may not light it on Shabbat?" But it can be said (answered) that, if so, he would not have needed to say, "both on Shabbat and during the week" - since it is [for] the same reason. Rather, he should have said, "We do not light" - without differentiation. [But] since he said, "both on Shabbat and during the week," we understand from it that there is still another reason for not lighting on Shabbat, besides the reason for the week; and that is lest he tilt it. And if so, he holds that it is permissible to use its light. However Rav, who said, "We may light both on Shabbat and during the week," could not have found to say, "we light," without differentiation. For I would have thought that it was [permissible] specifically during the week, but on Shabbat we may not light [it], lest he tilt [it]. As all things being equal, I would not have said that anyone would be stringent to forbid using its light. And so is the law, that it is forbidden to use the light of the Channukah light, like Rav and Rabbi Yochanan. And Abbaye also accepted this [to be the law]. And it is also implied later that Rav Yosef holds like this. And [if] it becomes extinguished, one is not bound to it - since all of them hold like this; whereas Rav Huna is alone, so the law is not like him.

Daf 21b



Line 1



Line 2



Line 3

<b>That if one did not light, he must light:</b> But from then on, the time has passed. RI Porat says that one should be careful and light immediately at night, so that he not delay too much. Nevertheless, if he did delay, he should light out of uncertainty. As behold, another answer is [also] answered. But it appears to RI that now there is no concern when one should light; for we only have the recognition of the members of our household [in our times], since we surely light indoors.

Line 4



Line 5

<b>And the <i>mehadrin</i> of the <i>mehadrin</i> (those who seek to beautify, among those who seek to beautify):</b> It seems to RI that Beit Shammai and Beit Hillel refer only to "a man and his household" (i.e. the head of the household alone lighting on behalf of his entire family). Because in this way, there is more beautification; since there is something recognizable when he keeps adding or removing [lights], corresponding to the days that are entering (the days of Channukah still to come) or exiting (the days of Channukah that have already passed). However, if he makes a light for each one (i.e. each member of his household gets his own light), even if he adds from now onwards, there is nothing recognizable, because [people] would think that this is the number of people in the household (i.e. instead of attributing the increase or decrease in lights to the intention of the owner to correspond to the day of Chanukah, people would attribute it to the intention to correspond to the number of people in the household). 

Line 6



Line 7



Line 8

<b>It is a commandment to place it at the entrance to one’s house on the outside:</b> And it is speaking about when there is no courtyard, but is rather a house standing adjacent to the public domain. But if there is a courtyard in front of the house, the commandment is to place [it] at the entrance of the courtyard. For later on (Shabbat 23a), it says, "A courtyard that has two entrances requires two lamps." And we also say (Shabbat 23b), "A lamp that has two spouts counts for two people." This implies two houses; but if they placed [it] at the entrance of their houses, it would be to the right for this one and to the left for that one (whereas it should be to the left for both of them). But if they place [it] at the entrance to the courtyard, it comes out fine.
<b>And in a time of danger:</b> It appears to RI that this is from the time that the <i>chabarei</i> (Zoroastrian fire priests) came to Babylonia, as it said in the chapter [entitled] Kirah (Shabbat 45a), "What is [the ruling with regard] to moving a Channukah lamp from before the <i>chabarei</i> on Shabbat?" But perhaps you will say, "They would also take it from upon the table, like it said in Gittin (17a), 'Rabbah bar bar Chanah became ill. A <i>chabar</i> came and took the light in front of them." But it can be said (answered) that they are not so accustomed to search inside houses.  

Line 9



Line 10

<b>That was placed with the seal of the High Priest:</b> If they had already decreed (Niddah 34a) upon the gentiles to be [considered] like <i>zavim</i> (those rendered impure by an abnormal genital discharge), we must say that it was placed with a seal into the ground; such that they not lift the vessel (since <i>zavim</i> render something impure when they lift it).

Line 11



Line 12



Line 13



Daf 22a



Line 1

<b>A Hanukkah lamp that one placed above twenty cubits is invalid, just as a sukkah and as an alleyway:</b> But perhaps you will say, "It should have said, 'Reduce [the height of] it,' like regarding the alleyway. Since there (Eruvin 2a), it said, 'an alleyway is rabbinic - [that is why] they taught the rectification.'" But it can be said (answered) that it mentioned, "invalid," because it needed to say, "just as a sukkah," which is from the Torah. Or also (another explanation) is that it did not want to speak at length: "Extinguish it, reduce [the height of] it and light it." As to reduce it and leave it as it is, would not be possible - as is shown later (Shabbat 23a). 

Line 2



Line 3



Line 4

<b>Sukkah was taught:</b> It is implied that the reason for the decorations of the sukkah is on account of contempt towards the commandment. But this is difficult to RI: In the chapter [entitled] Kirah (Shabbat 45a), it is implied that the reason is on account of, 'given that it is set aside for its commandment!' And he answered that they need both [reasons]. For [it it was only] on account of, 'it is set aside for its commandment,' we would not have forbidden it during the intermediate days of the festival. For setting aside is only relevant to Shabbat and to a holiday. And [if it was only] on account of contempt, we would not forbid them when they had fallen. But now that we say that they were set aside and [there is] contempt of the commandment, we forbid them even when they fell and even on the intermediate days of the holiday. And it is difficult to RI: Since the decorations of a sukkah are forbidden because of contempt - if so, what did it ask in Beitzah (30b) in the chapter [entitled] HaMevi, from the decorations of a sukkah to the wood of a sukkah (used for its roof)? As it said, "And does a stipulation not help with a sukkah for the holiday; and did we not learn, 'One who roofed according to its law [and hung decorations], etc.?'" But what is the question? Perhaps the condition does not help with the wood of a sukkah, because [its being put aside] is extracted from a verse [in the Torah] - as it is expounded there, "From where [do we know] about the wood of a sukkah, that it is forbidden all seven [days of Sukkot? Hence] it teaches to say (Leviticus 23:24), 'The festival of Sukkot is seven days, etc.'" And it is a full-fledged teaching, as it is shown in the first chapter of Sukkah (9a) that Beit Shammai invalidates an old sukkah from this verse, whereas Beit Hillel render it proper - since they need [the verse] for the wood of a sukkah, that it is forbidden all seven [days]. But a stipulation does work with the decorations of a sukkah, since they are only forbidden on account of contempt. Moreover, in the chapter [entitled] Kirah (Shabbat 45a), it is explicitly understood that the wood of sukkah is only forbidden on account of, 'it is set aside for its commandment!' And Rabbenu Tam responded that both the decorations of a sukkah and the wood of sukkah beyond [what is required for] the validation of a sukkah are only forbidden on account of contempt; or (alternatively) on account of, 'given that it is set aside for its commandment' - but only enough for the validation of a sukkah is forbidden from a verse. And the one who asked in Beitzah (30b) from the decorations of a sukkah, about the wood of a sukkah, did not know that there is a difference between more than enough for the validation of the sukkah and enough for the validation of the sukkah. And it answered, "Where one says, 'I am not removing myself from them throughout twilight' - as no sanctity attaches itself" to the decorations of a sukkah, as well as to the wood of a sukkah beyond the validation of a sukkah. There a condition helps. But with the wood of a sukkah of the sukkah's validation, "the sanctity attaches itself" perforce, from the word of the Torah, "all seven [days]." So his condition does not help. And that which it said over there, "And if he made a condition, it is all according to his condition"; and it asks, "Is that saying that his condition helps, etc.?" And it answers, "The second part [in which a condition is said to help is talking about] a hut in general." And after this, it asks, "And does a stipulation not help with a sukkah for the holiday; and did we not learn, 'One who roofed, etc.?'" [About this], it did not want to answer [that], "it is all according to his condition," is about that which is beyond the validation of the sukkah" - since, "it is all according to his condition," implies [that it is so] in the whole sukkah.   
<b>It is prohibited to use them until the conclusion of the last day of the festival:</b> And that which an etrog (citron) is permissible on the last day of the festival, more than a sukkah, is explained in the chapter [entitled] Lulav VeAravah (Sukkah 46b): Because when it is a doubt if it is the seventh or eighth [day], we sit in the sukkah. So if a meal chanced upon him at twilight, he would eat it there; and since it was set aside at twilight, it was set aside the whole day of the doubt about the eighth and the ninth [day]. However an etrog is not taken (shaken), when there is a doubt if it is the seventh or eighth [day], so it is only forbidden on the doubtful eighth [day] because it was set aside at twilight on the seventh [day]. And even though it is also forbidden at twilight of the eighth [day] because of the doubt about the day - since it is only forbidden on account of the doubt whether it is day or night, the whole day is not put aside with this. This is similar to an egg that was born on this [day] being permissible on [the other day], even though it was forbidden at twilight on account of the doubt whether it is day or night. 
<b>The paradigm of them all is blood:</b> That which it did not say, "the paradigm of them all is the wood of a sukkah, that we extract from a verse" - like it said at the beginning of [the chapter entitled] HaMevi: RI says that it is because we could not have learned from the wood of a sukkah, as a sukkah is different. For one who uses some of it negates the commandment, whereas with the decorations of a sukkah and with the changing of money by the light of the Channukah lamp, there is no negation of a commandment.

Line 5

<b>Rav said, "One may not untie <i>tzitzit</i> from [one] garment to [another] garment":</b> It is not necessary [to say] that it is forbidden if it is an obligation upon the garment; but even if it is an obligation on the person, it is forbidden as well. It is as we find with a <i>mezuzah</i>, that the one who took it was punished - in Bava Metzia (102a) at the end of the chapter [entitled] HaShoel - even though it is an obligation on the room. And Shmuel said that we may untie it: Even though Shmuel himself holds that it is on a obligation on the cloak, we remove them nevertheless; since he does it for the need of another garment. And concerning the <i>mezuzah</i> - such that he is punished - perhaps he did not have in mind to place it in another house. Or also (another answer), a <i>mezuzah</i> is different, since it is made to protect [one] from damaging spirits. And even though, according to everyone, we do not untie [<i>tzitzit</i>] when it is not to place them on another garment - that which is customary to untie the <i>tzitzit</i> from the cloaks of the dead is not difficult. For we only do not untie them from a cloak of one who is alive, as he is someone obligated.

Line 6

<b>In all matters of the Master, he acted in accordance with Rav:</b> There is a difficulty in the first chapter of Ketuvot (6a) - it is written there.

Line 7



Line 8



Daf 22b



Line 1



Line 2

<b>And does He require its light? Didn’t all those forty years:</b> It is a wonder: Why did it mention forty years? The whole world always walks by the light of the Omnipresent! And some explain it as, "Did Aharon need its light when he went inside?" [Accordingly,] didn't the pillar of cloud give light to them in all the places those forty years? It is as we say in the Baraita of the Work of the Tabernacle, "He would look inside a pitcher and know what is inside it; in a barrel and know what is inside it." And it so implied in Torat Kohanim - that it is referring to the priests. As there, it teaches the version, "And did they need the lamp? And didn't all of those forty years they not require the lamp? As it is stated (Exodus 40:38), 'For the cloud of the Lord was over the tabernacle.'" However at the end of [the chapter entitled] Kol Korbanot (Menachot 26b), it is implied that it is referring to the Divine Presence. As it cites it regarding that which Rabbi Elazar said, "I do not require [it] for eating and I do not require it for its light." And there it also said, "'To the curtain of the testimony' (Leviticus 24:3) - it is testimony to all who come to the world that the Divine Presence rests among Israel. But perhaps you will say (ask), 'Do I require its light,' Didn't all those forty years [etc.]?"   
<b>And with it he would conclude:</b> [Rashi] explained, "and with it he would conclude" the ordering (cleaning). For he would order the rest in the morning, but he would order this one in the afternoon. And he would hold the old one in his hand or place it in a vessel until he would place the oil and wick and light, and [then] light the others from it. But this is difficult to Riva: For if it is possible to light from the old light - if so - let him also light the other ones from it; so what is the question on Rav? Once he has removed the old wick from the lamp, there is no longer [an issue] of contempt of the commandment, nor [an issue of] weakening the commandment. But rather it is certainly impossible to do this. So when he came to order [the lamps], he would order everything in the lamp and the wick would become extinguished on its own. However while the old wick of the western lamp was still lit, he would light the others from it. And he would [then] order it, put oil and a new wick into it and light it from the others. So "with it he would conclude," [refers to] the lighting.
<b>But isn’t it true that here, since the lamps were fixed, etc.:</b> Like the one, in the chapter [entitled] Shtei Middot (Menachot 88b), who said that the lamp was flexible, as it is implied there that it was connected but it was flexible, in order that he could order it properly. But there is [also] one that said there that it was not fixed, but that he would rather remove it completely at the time of the ordering and place it [back] afterwards.

Line 3



Line 4

<b>What is about it:</b> It is a wonder: What is its question; and what is that which [Rav Huna, the son of Rabbi Yehoshua] also said, "We see if kindling, etc." Behold, it is at first glance implied that the law is like Shmuel (such that there is no question to be resolved)! For behold, Rabbah acted according to him. And if so, a wood chip is also permissible. For note that it is perforce about a wood chip that they argue, and about contempt for the commandment. As behold, the one that explained the reason of Rav being on account of weakening the commandment was refuted. So we must say that it did not hold the words of Rabbah to be essential. [Hence] he asked if placing accomplishes the commandment, so it is forbidden for Rav from lamp to lamp on account of contempt for the commandment, as it is with a wood chip; or does kindling accomplish the commandment, and it is permissible, like with the [Temple] candelabrum - for we are not concerned about weakening the commandment. And it concludes that kindling accomplishes the commandment, so it is permissible. Or also (another explanation): I found in the name of Rivam that it is asking according to Shmuel - as the law is like him - whether it is permissible with a wood chip or not. So he asks if we hold like it said above, that according to the one that said it is on account of contempt for the commandment, it is permissible to light from lamp to lamp according to Rav. And if so, they are arguing about a wood chip, and Shmuel permits with a wood chip. Or perhaps we do not hold like this and there is contempt of the commandment also from lamp to lamp, and Rav forbids [it] - since the placing accomplishes the commandment, such that it is not similar to the [Temple] candelabrum, and it is only from lamp to lamp that Shmuel permits. But with a wood chip, even Shmuel concedes that it is forbidden. It concludes - we see that we ask [this], and resolve that kindling accomplishes the commandment. So for Rav, one may kindle from lamp to lamp, like the candelabrum; and for Shmuel, it is permissible even with a wood chip.

Line 5

<b>As a dilemma was raised before them, does kindling accomplish the commandment, etc.:</b> And what comes out from it (the practical difference) is if a deaf-mute, a mentally compromised person or a minor lit or placed [the lamps].

Line 6



Line 7



Line 8



Daf 23a



Line 1

<b>It needed [to say,] one extinguishes it and lifts it and sets it down and lights it again:</b> But perhaps you will say (ask), "Why does he extinguish it and light it again? It is enough with placing it - since placing accomplishes the commandment! For is it being lit and staying alit any worse than the lighting of a deaf-mute, a mentally compromised person or a minor?" But it can be said (answered) that it is speaking about when he lit it from its start for the needs of Shabbat. And therefore it is worse than the lighting of a deaf-mute, a mentally compromised person or a minor. For there - since he lights it at its time, it is recognizable that he is lighting it for the sake of Channukah. (Riva)
<b>Conclude from this [that] lighting accomplishes the commandment:</b> And if so, it is permitted to light from lamp to lamp. Nevertheless, since the world has been accustomed to be stringent, we should not change the custom.

Line 2



Line 3



Line 4

<b>At first, my Master would seek sesame oil:</b> It appears that it is referring to the Channukah lamp, and it is because of the reason that he concluded - that its light is [long-lasting]. But for the Shabbat lamp, it is obvious that olive oil is [used to perform] the choice commandment, since it is drawn more readily by the wick than all [other oils] - as it is shown in our mishnah. For they all conceded that we light with it.

Line 3

<b>He then resolved it - the Hanukkah lamp takes precedence on account of publicizing the miracle:</b> And it appears to Rashba that when Rosh Chodesh Tevet falls out to be on Shabbat, we should read the haftara of the lamps in Zechariah, on account of publicizing the miracle; and not, "The heavens are my throne," which is the haftara of Rosh Chodesh. Moreover, since the last to read [from the Torah] reads from the [section related to] Channukah, he should read a haftara from the topic that he read [in the Torah]. And that which we first read from the [section related to] Rosh Chodesh: It is because, with the Torah reading, since he is able to do both of them - what is usual and publicizing the miracle - we do both of them, and the usual is first. But where it is not possible to do both of them, publicizing the miracle takes precedence. Also, there is not so much publicizing the miracle in the Torah reading, as it does not mention the lamps, like in the haftara. Moreover it appears to Rashba that this is why he have [the hafara] of Rosh Chodesh precede - in order that the one reading the haftara will read [the Torah section related to] Channukah and [hence] read the haftara of the lamps in Zechariah.

Line 4

<b>This is the version we teach, "He saw that they were accustomed to lights":</b> The explanation is both the husband and wife [were accustomed to this]. Hence he said, "Two great men will emerge from here." And later, it said [that] he saw that only the wife was accustomed [to it]. Hence he said, "A great man will emerge from here," in her merit.
<b>In Rabbi Sheivzi's family's house (<i>bei nasha</i>):</b> Rabbenu Tam said that [R. Sheizvi]'s father had already died. Hence it said it with this expression. As if he was alive, it should have said, "in his father's house." And Rabbenu Tam said in the name of Rabbi Shmuel that when we write a marriage contract (<i>ketuvah</i>) - if the father of the bride is alive, we write, "that she brings to him from her father's house." But if he is already dead, we write, "that she brings to him from her family's house." However, it appears to Rashba that we find that even when he is alive, it says, "the family's house": In the chapter [entitled] Mi  SheHechshikh (Shabbat 156a) - "Levi, son of Rav Huna bar Chiyah, found the one who kneads in his family's home kneading bran and feeding it to his ox. He kicked him. His father came and found him." So he can write what he wants on the marriage contract.

<b>This is [the version that] Rabbenu Tam taught:</b> Rabbi Yehudah, son of converts, went and related statements and they were heard by the government. But there are books in which it is written, "Yehudah" (without the title, Rabbi). But this does not appear [correct] to Rabbenu Tam. For we say in the first chapter of Moed Katan (9a) that when Rabbi Yehudah, son of converts and Rabbi Shimon ben Chalafta were parting from Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, he said to his son, "These people are men of noble form; go to them so that they will bless you." It is implied [from this] that he was a great man. And at the end of the discussion, [Rabbenu Tam] did not teach, "[turned him into] a pile of bones," [which] is a an expression of disgrace. Rather, "his soul rested."

They brought him [sheets], and he soaked them in water and spread them over it. [In every] place of impurity [it became] moist; [in every] place of purity [it remained] dry.'"

<b>Overturned the mountain above them like a tub:</b> And even though they had already first said, "We will do," before, "and we will hear" - perhaps they would retract when they would see the great fire [on the mountain], such that their souls departed. And [regarding] that which it said [that the other nations said in their defense for not accepting the Torah] in the first chapter of Avodah Zarah (2b), "Did you overturn the mountain above us like a tub" - which implies that if He had overturned [it] above them, they would not have had an answer (excuse); whereas here it said that it [itself] is a substantial caveat to the Torah: That means [that it is not an excuse, but rather a reason that would have made them guilty] for their not accepting it. But regarding their not keeping it, it would have been an [excuse].
<b>A substantial caveat to the Torah:</b> And [regarding] that which it said in Nedarim (25a), that Moshe made a covenant with Israel about the Torah and the commandments and had them take an oath about this; and in the chapter [entitled] Elu Ne'emanim (Sotah 37b), that they accepted all of the Torah at Mount Gerizim and at Mount Eival - Rabbenu Tam says that it was by way of a statement [from God]; so behold it is like [it was] against their will. But at the time of Achashverosh, they accepted [it] with their consent from love of the miracle. And [regarding] that which Yehoshua made a covenant with them to serve God - there they only accepted not to worship idolatry. As it is written (Yehoshua 24:), "God forbid for us to forsake the Lord"; and all of the matter [there] implies this.
<b>Rava said, "Even so, they again accepted it at the time of Achashverosh":</b> It is a wonder to RI. As in Megillah (7a) - concerning [the book of] Esther being [inspired by] the holy spirit - it said that Rav Yehudah said that Shmuel said, "If I had been there, I would have said to them, 'Mine is better than yours: "The Jews confirmed and accepted" (Esther 9:27) - they confirmed above that which they accepted below.'" And Rava said, "There is a refutation to all of them except for Shmuel, who does not have a refutation." But now Shmuel also has a refutation, since Rava himself establishes this verse [to be used] for another teaching; and in the first chapter of Chagigah (10a) - concerning the annulment of vows floating in the air - it is said, "They all have a refutation," and it considers that which the verse is needed for another teaching as a refutation! But if we have the version there, "Rabbah" (instead of "Rava"), it comes out well. Or also (another answer): This is what it meant in Megillah - they all have a refutation, since the other teachers pose difficulties about their reasoning, as it said over there; but Shmuel is not so difficult, but rather [only] needs the verse for another teaching.

Line 7

<b>Two crowns:</b> The were of majesty. Therefore when Moshe took [them], the skin of his face shone. 
<b>1,200,000 descended:</b> He expounded, two times, from its being written, "stripped themselves (<i>vayitnatzlu</i>)." And there are books in which it is written explicitly, "It is not stated, 'stripped (<i>vayinatzlu</i>),' but rather, 'stripped themselves (<i>vayitnatzlu</i>).'" And [this is the case] even though the trait of goodness is greater than the trait of punishment. [As] here too it is [actually] greater; since a good angel would tie two crowns, whereas an angel of destruction would only have the power to remove one.

Line 8

<b>Its fruit before its leaves:</b> Rabbenu Tam posed a difficulty, that behold we see that it grows like other trees! So he explained that <i>tapuach</i> (which is usually translated as apple) means citron (<i>etrog</i>). And (in the Targum,) we translate, "your breath is like <i>tapuchim</i>" (Song of Songs 7:8), as "like the fragrance of citrons". And the fruit of the citron is before its leaves, since it resides on the tree from one year to the next. And after a year, the leaves of the previous year fall and new leaves come. And that is [the meaning of] its fruit [come] before - those leaves. Yet it is a wonder that he brings the verse (Song of Songs 2:3), "As a <i>tapuach</i> among the trees of the wood." As Israel is not compared to a <i>tapuach</i> [here], but it is rather the Holy One, blessed be He; as it is written [earlier in the same verse], "so is my beloved among the youths." He should have preferably brought the verse of, "your breath is like <i>tapuchim</i>."

Line 2

<b>And it did not write, "It reeked":</b> It should not have written [such] an expression of disgrace. Rather it means to say, and it did not write, "its smell mixed," which would have implied [that] it reeked. Instead it wrote, "gave," an expression of affection.

Line 3

<b>Just as this hammer divides into several fragments:</b> Rabbenu Shmuel (Rashbam) asked, but behold Scripture implies that the hammer shatters the rock - as it is not written, "and a hammer is shattered [by] a rock." And likewise we see that it is a hammer that shatters rocks. And we may not suggest a version, "Just as this rock divides into several pieces." For behold the utterance - meaning Torah - is compared to a hammer, and not to a rock. And [Rashi] explained, "Just like the rock divides through it." But this is does not sit well [with the text]; since the utterance itself divides. So it is not a complete comparison. But Rabbenu Tam says that Scripture is speaking about a stone that shatters iron. As it said in Midrash Hazit, "There is a story about one who bought sapphire and came to check it. He placed it on an anvil and struck it with a mallet. The hammer split and the anvil broke, but the sapphire did not move from its place. And that is like it is written (Jeremiah 23:29), 'and like a hammer that shatters a rock.'" And even though it is not written, "and a hammer is shattered [by] a rock" - there are many verses like this matter: "Stones wear away water" (Job 14:19) - the explanation [of which] is, the water wears them down. [If so,] what it said in the first chapter of Kiddushin (30b) comes out well: "[A Sage from] the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught, 'My son, if this wretched one (the evil inclination) encounters you, pull it into the study hall. And if it is a stone, it will melt, as it is stated, "Stones wear away water" - the meaning [of which] is the water will melt them. 'And if it is iron, it will shatter' - the meaning [of which] is if the evil inclination strengthens itself against him like iron, it will shatter  - 'as it is stated, "and like a hammer that shatters a rock."'" And even though there it compares  the evil inclination to a hammer, and here it compares words of Torah to a hammer, there is no concern; as several explanations come out from one verse.

<b>Where is the Torah:</b> And if you will say, "And did Satan not know [about] the giving of the Torah" - it can be said that we say in the Midrash Lefanav Yelekh Davar that the Holy One, blessed be He, drove away the Angel of Death at the time of the giving of the Torah, so that he would not accuse, saying, "You are giving the Torah to a people that will sin with the calf in the future at the end of forty days?" And Satan is the same as the Angel of Death, as we say in the first chapter of Bava Batra (16a). And we also say in Sanhedrin (26b), "[The Torah is called] <i>tushiyah</i>, since it was given in secret (<i>nittenah  bechashai</i>) because of the Satan.

Line 6

<b>I will come at the end of forty days:</b> [Rashi] explained that that day that he ascended was not from the tally. And [Moshe] said to them forty complete days - the day and the night with it, but the night was not with the day that he ascended. Behold, he ascended on the Seventh of Sivan, [so] it comes out that the fortieth day was the Seventeenth of Tammuz. But it does not appear correct to the RI, the son of Rabbenu Meir. For it is clearly implied in the first chapter of Yoma (4b) that the day of ascent was from the tally. As over there it says, "It works well with Rabbi Akiva, you find them, that on the seventeenth of Tammuz the tablets were shattered. How so? Twenty-four days of Sivan and sixteen days of Tammuz; they total the forty days that he was on the mountain. On the seventeenth of Tammuz he descended.

Rather for trimming vegetables: It seems to R[abbenu] Y[itzchok] that [this verse is used here] as a support [for a Rabbinic enactment], for if it is [prohibited] by Torah, it would be prohibited on Yom Kippur as well.  Even though it says in Chapter Klal Gadol (73b) "one who trims beets is liable twice", there it referring to [beets that are] attached [to the ground].  Here it is referring to harvested [vegetables], as Rashi explained.  This is also not similar to what is said in Chapter Klal Gadol (74b) "One who minces beets is liable for [transgressing the Melachah of] Grinding", because there he is making very fine pieces whereas here he is making large pieces.
