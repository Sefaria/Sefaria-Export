Tosafot on Pesachim



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

Mishna - "On the night of the 14th, we search for hametz". Rashi explains the reason is so that one does not transgress the Torah prohibitions of seeing and finding hametz. This leads to a difficulty to the position of Rav Yitzchak the Elder - Since he requires "Bitul" (Annulment) as it mentions in the Talmud (Pesachim 6B) - "One who searches for hametz needs to annul." From the Torah, annulment is acceptable to avoid the Biblical transgression. Why did the Hachamim require searching at all? It seems to the opinion of Rav Yitzchak the Elder that even though annulment is sufficient, the Rabbis were stringent  to require the searching of hametz and to destroy it so that no person should come to eat hametz on Passover. Another reason - The Torah was stringent on the finding or seeing hametz in your possession, therefore, the Hachamim were stringent on requiring the individual to search and destroy even if he annuled his possession of hametz because one may come to eat hametz.

If From When the Key is Given Over - The explanation of Rashi is that transfer of the keys acquires. And this didn’t seem so to Ri [Rav Yitzchak ben Shmuel, a great-grandson of Rashi and student of Rabbeinu Tam] because it says in Merubah [7th Perek of Bava Kama] (BK 79a), “just as land is acquired by money, contract, and use, so rentership is acquired by money, etc.” And it doesn’t say that transfer of the key works except that it’s as though it [transfer of the key] says to you “use it and acquire it”, as it says in HaParah (BK 52a). And Ri explained that here, it is when he transfers to him the key and he hasn’t taken possession, and the one who has the key in his hand when the 14th falls is obligated to search, because the one who does not have in his hand the key, how can he enter and search? However, if a person entrusted the key to his house to another person, the person entrusted (Nifkad) is not obligated to search, but only if he wants to take possession of the house and acquire it.

...It was cinged before its time of biur hametz - he is allowed to derive benefit even after the time - For example, that is disqualified from being eaten by a dog, that in any other manner - this would not be allowed (to derive benefit). This is similar to the case of bread that became spoiled cite in the first chapter of Pesachim (15B).

Rabbi Yehuda says: From sunset to dusk one can walk four mil - Rabbeinu Tam finds this difficult, since at the end of [the chapter named] "With what do we light" (Shabbat 34b) it says: "What is twilight? From sunset for the whole time that the eastern sky is red - these are the words of Rabbi Yehuda." They conclude there that Rabbi Yehuda's twilight is three quarters of a mil, and here Rabbi Yehuda himself says it is four mil. One can [solve this by] saying that here he was stating from the beginning of sunset, which is when the sun begins to enter the width of the firmament, until the night time, which is four mil. There he was counting from the end of sunset.

<b>One does not recite two sanctifications over one cup:</b> And there are some that for this reason have the practice at a marriage not to say sheva berakhot (seven blessing said in honor of the bride and groom) over the cup of the grace after the meal, but rather bring another cup. And we do not recite the blessing, "who has created the fruit of the vine," over it, since he already recited [this] over the cup of the grace after the meal. For it is not correct to recite [the same blessing] twice. However Rabbenu Meshulam would say everything over one cup, since it is not similar to [doing so with] the grace after the meal and kiddush, as [those two prayers] are two [separate] matters - as we say adjacently (in the Gemara here). But here it is one matter, since the grace after the meal generates the blessing over the marriage. And we are accustomed to saying the blessings over the betrothal  and over the marriage over two cups. As it is common to have one without the other, as it said in Ketuvot (7b), "We recite the blessing over the betrothal in the house of the betrothal, and the blessing of grooms in the house of the grooms." Moreover, it is since we are accustomed to read the marriage contract (ketuvah) between them, so it would be an interruption. And we intend it to be so; and that is why one needs two cups.

<b>They were in that same miracle:</b> Rashba"m explained that they [the Jews] were redeemed through them [the women]. And similarly, in the Megilla, through Esther, and in Chanuka, through Judith. And it is difficult, since "even" implies that they aren't the main thing. And also, the version in the Jerusalem Talmud is "even they were in that same uncertainty," implying in that danger of "to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish" (Esther 3:13). And this that we say that they [women] are exempt from [the commandment of] sukka, even though that even they were in that same miracle, is [based on] "that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths" (Leviticus 23:43), there, is regarding a positive Torah commandment. However, regarding the four cups, which is rabbinic, they established it also for women, since they were in that same miracle.
