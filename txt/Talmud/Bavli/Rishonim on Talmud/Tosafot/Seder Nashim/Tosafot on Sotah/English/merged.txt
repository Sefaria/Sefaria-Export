Tosafot on Sotah



Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

The Gemara presents a question as to why the Tana only mentions Nazir in the context of Sotah, as stated in the beginning of Maseches Nazir (2a). The answer provided is that it does indeed fix Nazir in Seder Nashim on account of Sotah and not Nedarim, however, due to its similarity to Nedarim, it places it after Nedarim. <br>Another question is raised regarding why it did not fix Nazir in Seder Nashim on account of Nedarim, considering the fourth Perek of Nazir, where the Tana talks about the Nedarim of women and their nullification by their husbands. The Gemara responds that it prefers to ascribe Nazir to its similarity to Sotah, since the two Parshiyos appear next to one another in the Torah. This reasoning is also supported by the Gemara at the beginning of Shavu'os (2b).

<b>And the priest grasps her clothing</b> - in Makkot 22b, it's also taught "the attendant of the congregation takes hold of his clothes...". And it seems that because it is written about him "and he shall be degraded" (Deuteronomy 25:3), that it is a commandment to degrade him. In the Tosefta: "priests draw lots, and the one who draws the lot [to do this action], even the High Priest, goes and stands by the side of the <i>sotah</i>, and grasps her clothing"

And when he turns his face away from the congregation, what does he say? - The order of the Priestly Benediction according to Rabbi Shelomo [Rashi on Sotah 39b:4:1]: [The priest] uproots his feet from his place during the [blessing of Temple] Service, and comes before the ark, and prays "May it be Your will, ... that this blessing etc." as was stated earlier [Sotah 39a:6]. He prolongs this [prayer] until the congregation says Amen to the [blessing of] Thanksgiving. The prayer leader announces "Priests" if there are two of them; if there is [only] one, the prayer leader does not make the announcement, and [the one priest] turns around of his own accord, in accordance with Abaye, who stated earlier, "when there is one [priest] he does not call" [Sotah 38a:15]. When the statement of the caller finishes, he recites the blessing "who has sanctified us etc." [Sotah 39a:5]. After that, they begin the benediction. When the congregation's final Amen finishes, [the priests] turn around and bend their finger joints if they wish. The prayer leader begins "Grant peace" and the priests pray "Master of the Universe, we have performed that which You decreed upon us etc." [Sotah 39a:6], and prolong it until the prayer leader finishes the blessing. They uproot their feet and go.
In the Sheiltot, Parashat Korach, it states that a priest who worshiped idols may not recite the Priestly Benediction, since he is worse than someone who killed a person, as is stated in the chapter "One may only stand", "a priest who killed a person may not lift his hands" [Berakhot 32b:4]. Rabbeinu Gershom Me'Or Hagolah replies in his responsa that [a priest who has sinned and then repents] recites the Priestly Benediction and reads the first [portion] of the Torah [reading] -- once he has returned in repentance, he returns to his sanctified state -- as is stated in a mishna at the end of Tractate Menachot, "Nevertheless the priests of the private altars did not come up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem, but they did eat matza among their brethren [II Kings 23:9].The halakhic status of these priests is like that of blemished priests in that they receive a share in the distribution of the meat of the offerings and partake of that meat" [Menachot 109a:14]. Just as blemished [priests] may recite the Priestly Benediction and read the first portion in the Torah reading, so too this [repentant priest]. For if you do not say that, you will be weakening those who [seek to] repent, since they will say "woe due to that embarrassment, woe due to that shame", and will refrain from repenting. As Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Anyone who says that Manasseh has no share in the World-to-Come discourages penitents [Sanhedrin 103a:2]. And as the tanna of the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: Since he went and became a priest of idol worship, should I throw a stone after the fallen? [Kiddushin 20b:2] etc. (Also see Tosafot Menachot 109a s.v. "may not serve" [Tosafot on Menachot 109a:14:1] and Tosafot Taanit 27a s.v "If so just as" [Tosafot on Taanit 27a:1:1].)
