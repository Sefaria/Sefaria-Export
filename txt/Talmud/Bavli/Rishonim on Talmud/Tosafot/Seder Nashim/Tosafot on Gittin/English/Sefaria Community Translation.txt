"And one Sage[, Rabban Gamliel,] holds: [The reason is] because there are no witnesses available to ratify it, and [the residents of] these [places] are also not frequently available" - And the reason of Rabbi Eliezer is not because he holds that [cities] within [the boundary of Israel] are also not frequently available. Rather [Rabbi Eliezer holds] that you should not make a distinction between the overseas countries. As is implied nearby [in the Gemara].

"We learned in the mishna: One who brings a bill of divorce from one region to another region within a country overseas" - And from the first part of the Mishna "One who brings a bill of divorce from a country overseas" implies specifically from a country overseas to the land of Israel. It is not possible to apply [this rule (of saying it was written and signed before me)] that really in the same country overseas one also needs [to say it was written and signed before me]. This [example (of one who brings a bill of divorce from a country overseas)] was taken to exclude Rekem and Heger [from the rule of saying it was written and signed before me].

Rav Yitzhak said two [words, you can] write [without lines] - The Hilchot Gedolot decides [the Halacha] like Rav Yitzhak. Even though [Rav Yitzhak] argues on a Mishna, [The Hilchot Gedolot] knew that it was not important. 
Rabbeinu Tam says and Riva [Rabbeinu Yitzhak ben Asher] also explains in the name of Rabbeinu Eliahu that specifically when he intends to write the verse to expound upon it [the rule of Rav Yitzhak applies] as in our case. But when a person sends a letter to his friend, it is permissible to write the text of scripture, in order to write with proper grammar, without lines. 
However in the Yerushalmi the last chapter of Megillah slightly implies that [the rule of Rabbeinu Tam] is forbidden. It says [in the Yerushalmi] What is the law to write two or three words from a verse? It is brought: Rav Mona sent a letter to Rav Oshia bar Shimi [the letter quoted Job 8:7 with the words scrambled] "Though your beginning be small, In the end you will grow very great". It is implied [Rav Mona] only wrote [this] as a friendly letter and not to expound upon it and even so [Rav Mona] was careful to write it out of order. [Thus implying that if the verse was in order it would still require lines even though it was in a friendly letter] However many bring there that it appears they would write [the verse] to expound upon it [even when the verse was scrambled]. Because it says: Mar Ukva sent a letter to the exilarch (the exilarch would awaken and sleep with song. He explained that when [the exilarch] would lie down and get they would sing before him): "Rejoice not, O Israel, As other peoples exult"(Hosea 9:1) And so many people bring there [that a scrambled verse is not immune from being expounded upon]
If you will say, that it is said in Menachot 32b and in Megillah 18b: Tefilin do not need to be lined. Did we not [just] say that three or four words [from scripture] must be lined? Rabbeinu Tam says don't line Tefilin on every single line, as it is said in the Yerushalmi Shabbat chapter 2: Anyone who is exempt from something and [still] does it is called an idiot. This is also implied in Menachot 32b, because it says there: Tefilin do not need lines. And it is asked from a Braita: A Torah scroll or Tefilin that are worn out we don't make mezuzot from them because we don't go from a hard holiness to a weak holiness. What if we can go down [in holiness]? [It's still forbidden because] a Mezuzah needs to be lined [and Tefilin are not lined]. [whether or not Mezuzah needs to be lined is a Tannaic dispute] [Which opinion does our braita] deal with? With [Mezuzot] that are lined. It is implied that it is not common to line Torah Scrolls or Tefilin, and this is because [if one lines them,] he is called an idiot. However if the scribe is unable to write neatly without lines, he must line every single line because [of the verse] "This is my God and I will enshrine Him"(Exodus 15:2). Doesn't it say in Megillah 17b: "an ordinance of “equity and honesty:”"(Esther 9:30)? This teaches [us] that lines are needed according to the "truth" of Torah. Rabbeinu Tam says There was never a Torah scroll that did not require lines. Rather this [law from Megillah] is regarding Mezuzah, and [Mezuzah] is called the "truth" of Torah because it contains the singular name of the kingdom of heaven. Rabbeinu Hananel also explained: So it appears That a Torah Scroll that we make unusable according to the Kuntares in Megillah 19a because it is written on unfinished parchment or without black ink, [This law] is derived from [a Gezeirat Shavah (identity)] two mentions of writing. as it says "and I would write them down in the scroll in ink." (Jeremiah 36:18) Why don't we learn [this law of proper parchment and ink] from the "truth" of Torah . . .

The action of a court is written during the day, etc. - because from the moment a legal decision is rendered, there is a voice [announcing it], similar to a contract, as we say in every place: When [the litigant] stood in court concerning monetary matters.
Similarly, a marriage contract is written during the day and signed during the night - there are places where it is customary to write the marriage contract on Friday and sign it after the conclusion of Shabbat. However, it is not proper to do so due to the concern of an addition [to the written document], as perhaps it lacks a voice. Nevertheless, in a situation where they acquired it from him, there is no need to be concerned, as we say in Bava Batra (page 182b): "If you know the day on which you acquired [the document], write the day on which you acquired it."

Line 14

But engaged in that matter is valid - Because it has the legal effect as if they had already signed, since they are summoned to sign as mentioned above.

Line 15

Daf 18b



Line 1

"We suspect that he appeased" - It means that he secluded himself with his wife, and then the get becomes invalid. It is not a concern for divorce documents that come from overseas, and in the case of a third party delivering a get to his wife, why don't we suspect that he appeased her? The answer is that here we have a greater concern, as it has not been signed yet. Even if he does appease her, there is no room for concern because there is no finalization. Similarly, when he tells ten witnesses to sign, and he signs two of them on the same day, he is accustomed to appease, as long as the necessary signatures have not been obtained. And if he does appease, there is no concern. However, once all the witnesses have signed the get, and it is ready to be given, he is not accustomed to appease. When he does appease, everyone feels it, but it is difficult because of the case mentioned in Ketubot (29b) regarding someone who sent a get to his wife, and he told the messenger not to give it to her until thirty days have passed. He suspects that he appeased her during this time. Similarly, there is a difficulty with the statement, "If I have not come from here until twelve months," and Rashi explains that in the case of sending a get from overseas, we are not concerned that he appeased her, as the husband or the messenger can claim that he preceded them, and the get has already reached her, so there is no need to be concerned. But regarding the case of a third party delivering a get to his wife, it is difficult, and even according to Rabbi Yochanan, it seems to Rashi that in this case, we assume that he is with her in the same city and does not move from there because of the quarrel, and what determines the time of giving the get is for her benefit, not for appeasement. However, in those cases where he moves from there and is not with her in the city, it is assumed for her benefit that she does not become agitated, and the time is determined. We suspect that he might come in the midst of that time and appease her, and if he does appease her, there is no concern, as he does not divorce her due to the quarrel. Even Rabbi Yochanan agrees with this.
"Shema peis" - It explains in the commentary that he secluded himself with her, and it becomes an invalid get. However, it does not seem according to Rashi, because at the end of the chapter of "Mi She'Achazah" (Gitin 76b), it states that we are not concerned about an old get, as there was no seclusion. And the question there is regarding the case where the husband says to her, "I have given you a get, and it is invalidated if I pass by you within thirty days. And if I have not come from here until twelve months," since if he comes without any specific seclusion, the get is invalidated. But it seems that there are two different things here. Furthermore, why should we assume that he appeased her? Because of the concern of an old get? There, it speaks about a case where he says to her, "This is your get as long as I pass by you within thirty days. And if I have not come from here until twelve months," as since he did not say "from now on," and the get does not take effect until he passes by her after thirty days, even if he invalidates it later, it is still valid. But when he says, "from now on," and the get takes

Line 2



Line 3



Line 4

And you are not from here until ten days - and in the presence of all, as we say in Perek Kama (above, Gittin 10a), that the witnesses of the get do not sign it one without the other.

Line 5


Alternatively, in a case where one of them is found to be a relative or invalid - even though it is stated in the Gemara (Makkot, page 6) that we ask them whether they saw or did not see, here we do not ask, as it is obvious that they signed based on the knowledge of the husband.

Line 6

"He said to her, 'An invalid document can come for replacement in the case of ordinary contracts.' And if you ask, 'What is the difference between a linked get (divorce document) that was mentioned later in the Gemara in the end of Zorek (Gitin 82a) - whether it can be signed close, in the beginning, or in the middle, or at the end?' It can be said that a linked get is different because until its completion, three and two of them are valid signatures for the purpose of testimony. Therefore, it cannot come for replacement. However, here, since only two signatures are required for testimony, it can come for replacement.
But there is a difficulty since Chizkiyah said in the Gemara in the beginning of Meguresh (Gitin 87b) that the presence of close relatives is valid. And it is explicitly implied in the Gemara in Bava Batra (107a) according to the version of Chizkiyah regarding the filling of two sheets that were distant from the writing. It is said there that according to Chizkiyah, since the witnesses do not sign one another's signatures, it is assumed that the first witnesses are the essential witnesses, and therefore, it can come for replacement. However, there, in other documents, when it is seen that close relatives signed first, they will say that those who found it first signed first or afterwards signed for the purpose of filling. And according to Rosh, even if someone disqualified the document, it is only disqualified in the beginning, but it is valid in the middle and at the end. Since it is not at the beginning, it cannot come for replacement. But the difficulty is that it is taught in the Tosefta brought initially in a plain get (Bava Batra 123b): If there were four or five signed witnesses on the document, and it was found that the first two were close or disqualified, the testimony is valid regarding the others. This is the version in the Tosefta according to Rosh, who explains it as he explains in Hilchot Gedolot that specifically in the Baraita it stated that the first two witnesses are close, etc. We learn from this that those who signed first signed for the purpose of honor or filling, and therefore, the testimony is valid regarding the others. But if it is found from the middle or the end that they are close or disqualified, their testimony is invalidated. Indeed, it is certain that they signed for the purpose of testimony. Thus, it can come for replacement. However, it is difficult according to R"i who says that it is valid in all documents whether the two witnesses are close in the beginning, middle, or end. It is a suspicion that it can come into effect with two close witnesses and one valid one. And we cannot say that it is never valid until all the signatures are recognized. Although in a linked get, we can establish it from any three that are in it. Here, since it is necessary to sign all of them, it raises a question. And R"t responds as he explains in Halachot Gedolot: Specifically, it mentions in the Baraita that the first two are close, etc. We learn that those who signed first signed for honor or filling. But if it is found from the middle or the end, it is disqualified for everyone. If you ask, according to the one who says it is based on the witnesses, why do we require the other documents where they signed for the purpose of filling? We should ask them as we ask there, for the purpose of seeing their intention, etc. And Rabinu Tam says that it is different with a document of witnesses who signed

<b>Happy is the man who always fears:</b> In the chapter [entitled] HaRoeh, we say [that Rabbi Yishmael, son of Rabbi Yose] saw that a certain man was afraid. He said to him, "You are a sinner, as it is written, 'The sinners in Zion are afraid.'" But [the other] challenged from the verse here; and it was established to be about matters of Torah, such that he worries to not forget his studies and always reviews his learning. And here too, he brings [this verse] about these events in which they trusted in their great wealth and tranquility to embarrass Bar Kamtza and to stand up to Caesar's daughter, whereas they should have been afraid and worried about punishment. And that is not similar to someone who is afraid for nothing.

Daf 56a



Line 1

<b>A threefold (<i>tilta</i>) calf:</b> As in, "and <i>shalishim</i> (officers) upon all of them" (Exodus 14:7); and like, "a threefold (<i>meshuleshet</i>) calf and a threefold (<i>meshulash </i>) ram" (Genesis 15:9) - the explanation of which is, healthy and good. But there are some that explain it as the third in the womb. But that is not likely, since we say in the chapter [entitled] Arba Mitot (Sanhedrin 65b) that a threefold (<i>tilta</i>) calf was created for them. And it is not like the one who wants to explain that it has grown a third. For behold, at the end of the chapter [entitled] Rabbi Eliezer (Shabbat 136a), it said, "He made a threefold (<i>tilta</i>) calf for them on the seventh day" - its explanation being, the seventh day from its birth. (And see further [in] Tosafot [on] Bekhorot 19b, s.v. DeHach SheLo, etc.)

<b>And picked at his brain for seven years:</b> He did not become a <i>tereifa</i> (one who has a wound or condition that will lead to his death within twelve months) with this. For it entered through his nostril and did not pierce the membrane [of his brain]. Moreover (alternatively), there is a distinction between [what causes the condition of being a <i>tereifa</i> in] people and animals, as I explained in the first chapter of Eruvin (Tosafot on Eruvin 7a, s.v. Kegon).

[Tosfot quotes the Gemara:] "for whatever [amount of] money that they demand." [He was legally allowed to do this because where] there is a threat to life, we redeem the captives for more than their value. [This is like what] we say in Chapter 'Hasholeach' (above, page 47a) about one who sells themselves and their children to idol-worshippers, [and this is true] a fortiori here where there is a murderer. Alternatively, [he was allowed to redeem the baby for more than its worth] because [it possessed] great wisdom.
