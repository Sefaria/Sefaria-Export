Daf 12b







The Sages taught, "There are three partners in a person: The Holy One, Blessed be He, and his father and his mother. When a person honors his father and mother, the Holy One, Blessed be He, says, 'I ascribe credit to them as if I dwelt between them and they honor Me.'" It is taught, Rabbi says, "It is revealed and known before the One who spoke and the world came into being that a son honors his mother more than he honors his father (31a), because she cajoles him with words. Therefore Scripture (Exodus 20:11) had the honor of one’s father precede the honor of one’s mother. And it is revealed and known before the One who spoke and the world came into being that a son fears his father more than his mother, because his father teaches him Torah. Therefore, Scripture (Leviticus 19:3) had the fear of the mother precede the fear of the father.
